<h2>PREFACE TO REVISED EDITION</h2>


<p>The alterations and additions to this book in
its present form are due partly to fresh practical
experience; partly to adverse criticism of which
I now see the justice; and partly, as I freely
admit, to the picking of other people&#8217;s brains.
Since this book was published I have read for the
first time books on ski-ing by Zdarsky, Bilgeri,
Luther, and Arnold Lunn, and have re-read those
of Richardson, Rickmers, Paulcke, and Hoek.
As a result I have had to alter a good deal of
my theory and some of my practice, and to
alter and enlarge this book accordingly. To
all the above-named authors, therefore, I am
more or less indebted, and feel correspondingly
grateful.</p>

<p>In adopting an idea one can seldom help altering
it more or less, and if in the body of the
book I have made few direct acknowledgments,
it has been from no lack of gratitude, but rather
from a doubt whether the originator of the idea
would be gratified at its development or indignant
at its distortion.</p>

<p>I must however make special acknowledgments
to Ober-Leutnant Bilgeri. From his excellent
book I have gained much fresh knowledge of
the theory and practice of ski-ing. This book,
moreover, while confirming me in my opinion of
the vices of the Lilienfeld system of ski-<em>running</em>,
has given me a fresh insight into the virtues of
the Lilienfeld system of <em>teaching</em>, and consequently
a fresh sense of my indebtedness to
the chief apostle of this system, my first teacher,
Mr. Rickmers.</p>

<p>If Herr Bilgeri has ever happened to read my
book, certain resemblances between it and his
own&mdash;the analogy of the bicycle and tricycle with
the single and double-track runner, for instance&mdash;may,
since his book was published first, have
struck him as remarkable. I take this opportunity
of assuring him that when I wrote this
book I had not read his, nor for that matter
any of his writings, and that, if I had, the
resemblances would have been not only fully
acknowledged, but considerably more numerous.</p>

<p>To Mr. E. C. Richardson I must return special
thanks for criticism that has shown me the
error of some of my ways of thinking; I have
also to thank Mr. C. W. Richardson for new
ideas gained from an article by him on &#8220;Knee
Action in Ski-ing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Finally, I wish to express my gratitude to
everyone whose suggestions I have adopted, or
who, either by precept or example, has taught me
anything new and so has had a hand in the
revision of this book, but to whom I have not
referred individually.</p>

<p>This heavy list of acknowledgments makes me
realise more than ever how difficult it is nowadays
for a writer on ski-ing technique&mdash;or at
any rate for <em>this</em> writer&mdash;to say anything new. I
am afraid that even a <em>succès de scandale</em> as the
fanatical prophet of complete sticklessness will
soon be out of my reach, if it is not already,
for we are all agreed now that the stick should
be used as little as possible, and therefore that
not to use it at all is, if possible, best. It is
a short step from this to finding out by practical
experience that, so long as one is travelling
on <em>snow</em>, not <em>ice</em>, and has a little more than
room enough to place the skis horizontally across
the slope, one can move just as freely, quickly,
and easily, and with just as perfect control,
without the stick as with it.</p>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTORY" id="INTRODUCTORY"></a>INTRODUCTORY</h2>

<h3><a name="THE_ENGLISHMAN_AS_A_SKI_RUNNER" id="THE_ENGLISHMAN_AS_A_SKI_RUNNER"></a>THE ENGLISHMAN AS A SKI-RUNNER</h3>


<p>Probably every one likely to read this book
knows that a ski is a snow-shoe or skate, and
that it is a long narrow plank turned up in
front, but he may not have a very clear idea
of the use of it.</p>

<p>It may not have occurred to him, for instance,
that in a country which is deeply covered with
soft snow (the surface of snow is sometimes a
hard crust) a man without snow-shoes of some
kind is not merely unable to move quickly, but
is unable to move at all outside the cleared
roads and beaten tracks.</p>

<p>Merely to prevent sinking into the snow the
ski is just as useful as a snow-shoe of the racquet
form, such as the Canadian, and it is never <em>less</em>
useful than the other even when it seems most
likely to be. For moving through dense underwood,
for instance, when its length would appear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
likely to be awkward, or for hauling sledges, when
its slipperiness would seem a disadvantage, experience
shows that the ski is fully as useful as
the other type.</p>

<p>As a means of locomotion it is altogether superior.
Over level open country a man can slide
along on skis a great deal faster than he can
walk (or run) on Canadian snow-shoes.</p>

<p>In hilly country the ski-runner has a further
advantage. If a hill is not steep a man may walk
straight up it on racquets rather more quickly
than a man on skis can climb it by zigzagging
(as he is obliged to do on all but the most gradual
slopes); but on the descent the ski-runner more
than makes up the time he has lost; for, helped
by gravity, he slides down the hill at least
three, perhaps as much as thirty, times as fast
as he climbed it, according to his expertness
and the nature of the ground, while the other
takes almost as long to <em>walk</em> down as he did to
walk up.</p>

<p>On very steep ground the ski-runner has a
still greater advantage, for here the narrowness
of the ski allows him to move across the steepest
snow slopes with little or no discomfort to his
ankles, while on a steep slope the man on
racquets is practically helpless, for, on account of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
their shape, it is only with the utmost difficulty,
if at all, that he can move either up, down,
or across the hill.</p>

<p>A moderately expert ski-runner can man&oelig;uvre
on any sort of ground which is covered with
snow, provided that the surface of the snow be
not so hard that the edges of his skis can make
absolutely no impression in it. The steepness of
a slope, no matter how great, is in itself no
obstacle to his man&oelig;uvring with perfect freedom;
it need only be reckoned with in so far as it
relates to the danger of avalanche.</p>

<p>This should give some idea of the scope of
ski-running considered merely as a means of
locomotion.</p>

<p>With regard to the possibilities of ski-running
considered purely as a sport, it may be said that a
good runner, descending a steep hill where the
ground is open, will often cover a considerable
distance at an average rate of 45 miles an hour:
that when moving at half that speed he can
thread his way among obstacles or stop suddenly;
and that the present record for a jump on skis is
about 154 feet. I need hardly say, therefore, that
the opportunities afforded by the sport for the
exercise not only of the runner&#8217;s nerve, but of his
skill and judgment are almost unlimited.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>Now it is only by learning the best methods
and style at the very outset (or by changing
them if he has started with bad ones) that a
man can develop to the utmost whatever latent
capacity for ski-running he may possess, and
only in this way that he is ever likely to become
expert enough to have any right to the title of
a good runner.</p>

<p>At this point I had better, for the benefit of
those readers who have already used skis, give
some sort of definition of good ski-running as I
understand it.</p>

<p>It is not quite easy to do so, but I take it
that the best judges would hardly call a man a
good runner unless he could run steadily, quickly,
and easily down any hill on which ski-ing was
possible at all&mdash;no matter how difficult the ground
might be as regards obstacles, gradient, and
condition of snow&mdash;<em>without ever using his stick
as an aid to the balance or for steering, or, except
on the very rarest occasions, for helping him to
slow up or stop</em>; and unless he could, on an
ordinary jumping hill, make jumps of fair length
without falling very often.</p>

<p>Such a man would probably be able to make, in
that kind of snow which is appropriate to each,
all the swings and turns to either right or left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
while running at a good speed, and would almost
certainly both run and jump in really good style.</p>

<p>A good runner, indeed, can nearly always be
recognised by his style, although, of course, a man
cannot be called a bad runner, however bad his
style, if he is really fast and steady downhill,
and can make long jumps with certainty. But
a ski-runner with a bad style is below his proper
form; if, with a bad style, he is fairly fast and
steady, and is good at jumping, he would with
a good style be exceptionally so.</p>

<p>Among the Scandinavians or the best continental
runners, no one would be considered at
all good on skis unless he more or less fulfilled
the above definition. Among English runners, I
am sorry to say, the standard, not only of performance,
but of criticism, is far lower, and
although there are by this time many Englishmen
who are capable tourists and mountaineers
on skis, there are almost none who can be called
good runners in the above sense, or who can
be compared with the best continental runners
even, while to compare them with the best
Scandinavians would be ludicrous.</p>

<p>Among the English at Swiss winter-places a
man is often spoken of as &#8220;good at ski-ing&#8221; for
no better reason than that he spends most of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
time on skis and has climbed several hills on
them, or has crossed several passes; while if
it is known that, as a rule, he gets through a
day&#8217;s run without falling, he is sure to be considered
a most accomplished ski-runner. Quite
as reasonably might a man gain a reputation for
fine horsemanship simply through being able to
make long journeys on horseback without falling
off or getting exhausted. Just as the latter may
easily be a poor horseman, so may the former be
a very poor ski-runner; the fact that he may
happen to be a great mountaineer gives him no
more claim to the title of a fine ski-runner than
does the fact of his being a fine ski-runner
to the title of a great mountaineer.</p>

<p>If asked his opinion of some such champion, a
good Swiss runner will usually answer tactfully,
&#8220;He is good, for an Englishman.&#8221; The full value
of this compliment can only be appreciated by
some one who, like myself, has overheard Swiss
runners criticise an exhibition of unusual awkwardness
and timidity on the part of one of their
own countrymen in the words, &#8220;He runs like an
Englishman.&#8221;</p>

<p>It would be very nice to think that jealousy
of our prowess in ski-ing made them talk like this,
but that, unfortunately, is out of the question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>The fact is that most English runners seem to
be perfectly contented with just so much skill as
will enable them to get up and down a hill at a
moderate speed and without many falls. Having
acquired this, they give up practising altogether,
and devote the rest of their ski-ing lives to
making tours, never attempting to become really
fast or skilful runners or to go in for jumping,
even in its mildest form.</p>

<p>It is rather curious that this should be the case,
for most English ski-runners are young and active
men, accustomed to other sports and games, who,
I suppose, take up ski-running at least as much
for its own sake as with the object of using it as
an aid to mountain-climbing and touring.</p>

<p>Surely, then, one might reasonably expect that
a fair number of them would become really fine
runners, that nearly all of them would try to,
and that even those who had no ambition to excel
in the sport for its own sake would be anxious
to increase their efficiency as mountaineers or
tourists, and would therefore, at the very least,
try to run in good style; for good style, in ski-running
as in every other game or athletic sport,
means economy of muscular force, which is surely
an important consideration to the mountaineer.</p>

<p>Most good Swiss runners, I am sure, think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
that the Englishman is constitutionally incapable
of becoming really good on skis. To me, at any
rate, it is by no means surprising that they
should think so, for, taking any average pair of
ski-runners, Swiss and English, who are about
equally matched in age, physique, and ski-ing
experience, even if there be little to choose
between them in the matter of skill, there is in
one respect a very marked difference&mdash;the Englishman
nearly always running more slowly and
cautiously and altogether with less dash than the
Swiss. In fact, not to put too fine a point upon
it, the Englishman, as compared with the Swiss,
generally shows what an unsympathetic critic
might call a distinct tendency to funk.</p>

<p>How English and Swiss ski-runners compare,
in this respect, with those of other countries I
have had no opportunity of judging, but that,
when compared with each other, there is this
difference between them must be obvious to any
impartial observer. If the Englishman&#8217;s lack of
dash arises entirely from poorness of nerve, he is,
of course, very heavily handicapped, though not,
perhaps, hopelessly so, for patience, determination,
and careful training will do wonders in the
improvement of bad nerve. I should like, however,
to think that there may be some more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
flattering explanation of this phenomenon&mdash;I
have, for instance, heard it said that the fact
that most Englishmen are unaccustomed to steep
slopes may have something to do with it&mdash;but
I must confess that, so far, I have not hit upon
one that entirely satisfies me.</p>

<p>I have heard two excuses given (by Englishmen)
for the low standard of English ski-ing as
compared with Swiss. One is that the Englishman
gets less practice than the Swiss. This is a
mistake. The average English runner perhaps
gets only three or four weeks each winter, but
the average Swiss gets no more, for he has his
work to do, and though he spends his winter in
the snow he usually only goes ski-ing on Sundays.
The best Swiss runners no doubt are usually
guides, or men who spend most of their time in
the winter on skis; but this is not always so,
and I know more than one first-class Swiss
runner who gets little more than one day a week.
Among English runners the proportion of those
who spend most of their winter on skis is
much greater than among the Swiss; yet there
are now many really first-rate Swiss runners,
but, as I have said, hardly any English
ones.</p>

<p>The other excuse is that most English ski-runners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
have taken up the sport comparatively
late in life.</p>

<p>No doubt they have, and so, for that
matter, have many of the continental runners&mdash;and
a few of the best of them. But to begin
late is much less of a handicap than might
be imagined, for a man may become a skilful
ski-runner without possessing any of the characteristics
of extreme youth.</p>

<p>That is to say that, provided he has a fair
stock of intelligence, patience, and nerve (and a
good teacher), he need have no special aptitude
for picking up the knack of unaccustomed movements,
nor need he have more than ordinary
strength and activity.</p>

<p>The games and sports which are most difficult
to learn late in life are those which call for
&#8220;knack&#8221;&mdash;in other words, the ability to perform
easily a rapid and accurate co-ordinated movement
of a number of muscles. If this movement
is an unaccustomed one, the ability to perform it
properly is only attainable by long practice.</p>

<p>The action of throwing, for instance, requires
knack. It is this which makes it so difficult to
learn to throw with the left hand, even though
one already has the ability to move the left arm
with quite sufficient strength and speed, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
not only knows how the movement should be
made, but even <em>how it feels</em> to make it with the
other hand. Writing is another excellent example
of knack.</p>

<p>In ski-running nothing which can strictly be
called knack comes into play. In this sport
the <em>voluntary</em> muscular movements (as distinguished
from the involuntary ones used in keeping
the balance) are neither complicated nor
unusual, and, except in jumping, they need
seldom be rapid. Any difficulty in learning them
is due partly to the disturbing effect on one&#8217;s
clear-headedness of the speed at which one is
travelling, and partly to the fact that some of
the movements, though simple in themselves, are
almost the reverse of those one&#8217;s natural instinct
would prompt one to make in the circumstances.
This difficulty, of course, diminishes
with practice, but an effort of will goes just as
far as, or even farther than practice towards
overcoming it. Were it not for this difficulty,
a man who had been told the right way to
perform the various man&oelig;uvres employed in
ski-ing might very well do them fairly correctly
the first time he tried (as many people actually
do), while no amount of strength, activity, intelligence,
or confidence would enable him, if right-handed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
to throw or to write properly with his
left hand without long practice.</p>

<p>The balancing difficulty is far less serious
than is usually supposed. It is the <em>unexpected</em>
movements of the skis which generally upset
the balance; and if one has a clear comprehension
of the way in which various combinations
of gradient, speed, quality of snow, &amp;c.,
affect their motion (see <a href="#Page_74">p. 74</a>, &amp;c.), one will seldom
be taken by surprise. Any one who can stand
steadily on one leg, when not on skis, for a
quarter of a minute, without waving his other
limbs about, has sufficient sense of balance to
become a first-rate ski-runner. Intelligence and
nerve&mdash;the latter including both coolness and
dash&mdash;are the main factors in good running.
It is hard to say which is the more important.
Most of one&#8217;s mistakes in ski-ing can perhaps
be traced to want of nerve, but the most perfect
nerve will not compensate for lack of intelligence.
The intelligent man will soon see that
there is very little to be afraid of, that the
risk of injury from falling (on snow), even when
running fast or alighting after a long jump,
is very slight, and that to run with confidence
and dash will lessen the danger rather than
increase it. When he has thoroughly realised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
this, the intelligent man, though his nerve may
be none of the best, will probably, if he has
any determination, soon beat the absolutely
intrepid but stupid one.</p>

<p>Unless, then, we are to believe that a man
loses most of his nerve, intelligence and will-power
with his first youth, there is nothing to
prevent him from learning to ski well when no
longer very young.</p>

<p>My own belief is that the best excuse for the
low standard of British ski-running is ignorance
and bad tuition.</p>

<p>A few English runners have learnt a good
system of ski-ing; but these have generally had
bad teachers&mdash;Swiss guides, very likely, who,
though first-rate runners themselves, had more
instinct than science, and were quite incapable
of imparting clearly to a beginner whatever
knowledge they possessed. The majority of
English ski-runners have learnt a thoroughly
<em>bad</em> system, and have very likely learnt at the
same time to believe that it is an exceptionally
sound one.</p>

<p>The members of both these classes are, as a
rule, profoundly ignorant of what an expert
can do on skis, of the real advantage of becoming
an expert&mdash;or, at any rate, as skilful as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
possible&mdash;and of the best way to set about
doing so.</p>

<p>There is no reason whatever why, with
practice and good teaching, any man should not
become a fairly skilful runner; even if he cannot
run with great dash and speed, he can, at least,
learn to do so in good style, without&mdash;or practically
without&mdash;any help from his stick.</p>

<p>Very few Englishmen try to do this; indeed,
next to caution, the most prominent characteristic
of English ski-running is bad style.</p>

<p>Now nearly all the continental runners&mdash;certainly
all the best of them&mdash;have taken the
Norwegians as their model, and have, in consequence,
aimed not only at running as fast and
steadily, but also, in one sense, as easily as possible;
that is to say, with the least muscular
effort compatible with a perfect control of their
skis, or, to put it more simply, <em>in the best style</em>.</p>

<p>Most Englishmen, however, have learnt a
very different method of ski-ing. This system
also teaches the beginner to run as easily
as possible, but in quite another sense. The
whole aim of the system is to dispense as far
as possible with skill rather than with effort.
That is to say, it directly encourages bad style.</p>

<p>The system is the invention of an Austrian,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Herr Zdarsky, who, having never seen a ski-runner
and knowing nothing about skis or their
management, got a pair from Norway, and
reasoned out a method of using them, eventually
altering them to suit his method.</p>

<p>This was certainly a very surprising achievement,
as every one will agree who realises not
only the practical difficulty of ski-running, but
the complication of its dynamics.</p>

<p>What is less surprising, when one remembers
the origin of Zdarsky&#8217;s system, is that it teaches
not one simple method of controlling the skis that
had not been discovered long before, and but few
of those that had been. It must in fact be
regarded, not as a new and different system,
but as a small part of an old one&mdash;the whole
Norwegian system of ski-running.</p>

<p>The distinguishing features of Zdarsky&#8217;s
system are an almost exclusive reliance on the
snow-plough position (or an approximation to
it), for either braking, turning, or stopping, a
deliberate use of the stick to assist these man&oelig;uvres
and to help the balance on all occasions,
an extreme dislike to going fast, and, in general,
a pronounced tendency to avoid difficulties of
balance rather than to overcome them, and to
encourage timidity as well as clumsiness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>The main object of Zdarsky&#8217;s system is to
enable a beginner to run safely on steep and
difficult ground with the least possible preliminary
practice; and so far, no doubt, it is
successful. But its very weakness is what makes
it successful, for it turns out ski-runners quickly
by allowing them to run badly. It is the very
worst school for a beginner who takes up ski-ing
no less for its own sake than as a means to
an end, for if he begins in this way, sooner or
later he will have to alter his methods entirely,
and get rid of a lot of bad habits which he would
never have acquired if he had, from the outset,
learnt his ski-ing in the Norwegian manner.</p>

<p>To become a fairly proficient stick-riding and
zigzagging crawler is a very simple matter; but
to get beyond this point, and, discarding the
help of the stick, to learn an <em>equally safe</em> but
considerably quicker and more comfortable style
of running, is impossible without devoting some
time and pains to practising, though far less of
both than is usually supposed.</p>

<p>Every one, of course, has a perfect right to
choose the style of ski-ing that suits him best. If
a man looks upon ski-running simply as a means
of locomotion, or if he dislikes the trouble of
practising, or has exceptionally poor nerve, or is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
extraordinarily clumsy, he will very likely be
perfectly satisfied with a slow stick-riding system,
and will quite reasonably refuse to try anything
else. So far there is no harm done.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, however, many of those who
choose this primitive method of ski-ing make the
absurd mistake of thinking that their method is
a particularly sound and practical one, and delude
the innocent novice into thinking the same.</p>

<p>Realising that without the stick they themselves
would be helpless, they say that its help is
indispensable for safe running. Anything which
they cannot do themselves, such as running with
the skis together so as to leave a single track;
turning or stopping by a free use of the different
swings, &amp;c., instead of by their own dreadful imitation
of the Stemming turn and Christiania;
fast straight-running; jumping, and so on, they
condemn as showy, unsafe, and of no practical use,
and class under the general heading of &#8220;fancy
tricks.&#8221; The absurdity of this standpoint will
be patent to any one who knows the immense
superiority of good running to bad, as regards
ease, sureness, and speed.</p>

<p>Let us compare ski-running with horsemanship.
Just as the ski-runner undoubtedly finds
it easier at first to run with the aid of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
stick than without, so the man who mounts a
horse for the first time will certainly find it a
good deal easier to keep in the saddle if he holds
on to it by the pommel or cantle. I believe,
however, that there is no school of horsemanship
which advocates this method of riding as
being particularly practical.</p>

<p>The reasons against the use of the stick as an
aid to the balance in ski-running are much the
same as those against using the saddle for the
same purpose in riding. There is a waste of
energy in each case, for it is doing clumsily by
brute force what can be done more comfortably,
gracefully, and effectively by skill. Moreover, the
balance, when helped in this way, never improves,
but remains permanently bad.</p>

<p>Correct position, narrow track, complete command
of the different swings&mdash;all those things,
in fact, which distinguish good style from bad&mdash;mean
economy of force, and are therefore
eminently practical. To say that jumping is a
useless accomplishment may at first sight appear
justifiable. In one sense there is not much
practical use in jumping, for occasions are not
very often met with in the course of a tour
where a jump is the only way, or even the
safest way, out of a difficulty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>But in another sense jumping is extremely
practical. It accustoms a runner to moving at
the highest possible speed, and shows him that
he need not mind taking a fall at this speed;
moreover, to quote from Mr. Richardson&#8217;s excellent
jumping chapter in &#8220;The Ski-Runner,&#8221; &#8220;the
first thing which a jumper has to learn is how
to keep calm and collected and to make up his
mind instantly what to do next when travelling
at top speed&mdash;just the very things, in fact, which
he must learn if he wants to be a good cross-country
runner. For these reasons it is the
very best and quickest way of generally improving
a man&#8217;s running.&#8221;</p>

<p>A very common attitude of Englishmen towards
ski-jumping is to treat it as a showy and
dangerous acrobatic display, all very well for
reckless and athletic youths, but out of the question
for any one else. Yet I suppose that among
the men who take up this attitude there are
many who ride to hounds, and very few who,
though they may not themselves hunt, would
dream of attributing to men or even women
who do so either undue recklessness or unusual
acrobatic ability.</p>

<p>Though there may be a doubt as to whether
making a jump of moderate length on skis or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
riding a horse over a fence is the more difficult
feat, there can be none whatever as to which is
the more dangerous. Ski-jumping, indeed, is so
safe that perhaps it could hardly lay claim to
the title of a great sport but for the fact that
it is not only difficult, but also exceedingly,
if unreasonably, alarming&mdash;at all events to the
beginner. It seems strange that so many
able-bodied English ski-runners never so much
as give jumping a trial, unless they have an
altogether wrong idea of its danger.</p>

<p>I spoke just now of the ignorance which made
many bad runners condemn a better style of
ski-ing than their own. It is not easy, at first
sight, to see why this ignorance as to the comparative
advantages of good and bad running
should be so common as it is, for at most of the
Swiss winter places there are among the natives
some really good performers. The English, however,
get few opportunities of watching the Swiss
runners, except on the jumping hill, and seldom
see them doing their best across country, for
these men, unless they happen to be guides,
do most of their ski-ing with their own
countrymen, the members of their own local
ski-club.</p>

<p>Moreover, a good ski-runner is not seen at his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
best when acting as a guide, for he has to go
slowly, and look after the weaker members of the
party, and there is no element of competition to
put him on his mettle.</p>

<p>Whatever may be the reason, the fact remains
that the average British ski-runner has little or
no idea of the superiority of good running to bad
as regards safety, comfort, and speed&mdash;to say
nothing of interest or beauty. He would probably
be surprised and somewhat sceptical if told
that by learning a good style of ski-ing he would
find it possible to do the downhill portion of his
tours in about half the time (or less), with half
the fatigue, with just as few falls (if he wished to
avoid them), and with far less chance of hurting
himself when he did fall&mdash;for bad style
means awkward falls; that he would thus get
infinitely more pleasure, interest, and excitement
out of his ski-ing, and that, moreover,
by going in for jumping he would still further
increase all these benefits without increasing his
risks.</p>

<p>I hope that by means of this rather rambling
discourse I may have managed, not only
to show what, in my opinion, are the reasons
for the low standard of English ski-ing, but
at the same time to implant a conviction of sin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
in the conscience of the average English ski-runner.</p>

<p>The object of the rest of this book is to show
him what, to my thinking, is the way of salvation,
and to place the innocent novice in the path of
virtue at the very outset.</p>

<h2><a name="EQUIPMENT" id="EQUIPMENT"></a>EQUIPMENT</h2>

<h3><a name="THE_SKI" id="THE_SKI"></a>THE SKI</h3>


<p><em>The Wood.</em>&mdash;Skis are usually made of ash, which
is, perhaps, on the whole, a more suitable wood
than any other. Hickory is excellent, but is said
to be more brittle than ash, and is also heavier.
It is, however, but little heavier than the <em>best</em>
ash, for in the latter wood lightness means bad
quality. The wood must be well seasoned, and
as free as possible from knots, especially near the
bend and the binding, though small knots which
do not extend through the whole thickness of the
ski cannot do much harm.</p>

<p>The grain of the wood should be wide and
well marked. The way it runs in the ski is most
important; it should run parallel with the long
axis of the ski throughout its length, above all
at the front bend and the binding; for if the
grain run out at these points, the ski will be very
liable to break there. If anywhere else the grain
runs out at all, see that it does so in such a way
that the lines on the <em>side</em> of the ski run backwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
and downwards (<a href="#fig01">Fig. 1</a>, <span class="smcap">a</span>), not forwards
and downwards (<a href="#fig01">Fig. 1</a>, <span class="smcap">b</span>).</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a id="fig01"></a><img src="images/fig01.jpg" width="400" height="157" alt="Figure 1" title="Figure 1" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 1.</span></p>
<p class="caption2">Cross-grain; in <span class="smcap">a</span> it does not much matter, as it only occurs at some
distance from the binding and points backwards; <span class="smcap">b</span> is very bad.</p>
</div>

<p>If the lines of grain on the <em>sole</em> of the ski
run across at all instead of parallel to the sides,
the ski, when it gets rather worn, will not run
straight. If, of a pair of skis, one runs to the
right and one to the left, it does not much matter,
for in that case the former can be put on the left
foot and the latter on the right; they will then
merely keep together and hold each other
straight.</p>

<p>But if both skis run off to the <em>same</em> side there
is nothing to be done, so look carefully at the
grain of the sole when choosing them, to see that
there is no chance of this (<a href="#fig02">Fig. 2</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a id="fig02"></a><img src="images/fig02.jpg" width="400" height="101" alt="Figure 2" title="Figure 2" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 2.</span></p>
<p class="caption2">Cross-grain on running surface: <span class="smcap">a</span> converging, not very serious;
<span class="smcap">b</span> parallel, very bad.</p>
</div>

<p>There is one more point to be noticed about
the arrangement of the grain in the ski.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>If you look at the <em>heel end</em> of the ski, you will
generally see the grain disposed in vertical lines,
as in <a href="#fig03">Fig. 3</a>, <span class="smcap">b</span>. The ski will not only be stronger
and more springy, but will wear better and run
faster if cut so that the grain lies horizontally
(<a href="#fig03">Fig. 3</a>, <span class="smcap">c</span>).<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> <a href="#fig03">Fig. 3</a>, <span class="smcap">a</span> shows a disposition of the
grain which is likely to weaken the ski and
should be avoided.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a id="fig03"></a><img src="images/fig03.jpg" width="150" height="144" alt="Figure 3" title="Figure 3" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 3.</span></p>
<p class="caption2"><span class="smcap">a</span> bad, <span class="smcap">b</span> good, <span class="smcap">c</span> still better.</p>
</div>

<p>The colour of a ski is a matter of taste.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Dark colours have the disadvantage of causing
the snow which collects on the top of the ski
to melt more readily; it may then refreeze
and accumulate, forming an unnecessary load
of ice.</p>

<p>A dark colour also makes it more difficult to
detect faults in the grain, and it is wiser for
this reason to buy plain varnished skis, and colour
them afterwards if you want them darker.</p>

<p>New skis should be given several coats of
boiled linseed oil, each being allowed to sink in
before the next is applied. When at last the
wood will absorb no more, give it a coat of <em>raw</em>
linseed oil; this dries hard, with a surface just
rough enough for easy climbing, but slippery
enough to make waxing unnecessary, except for
the very stickiest snow. The more often skis
are oiled, even when in use, the better.</p>

<p><em>Dimensions.</em>&mdash;When you are standing with
your arm stretched at full length above your
head, the ski, placed upright, should be at least
long enough for its tip to reach the roots of
your fingers; it may well reach a few inches
beyond the finger-<em>ends</em>.</p>

<div class="figright">
<a id="fig04"></a><img src="images/fig04.jpg" width="188" height="500" alt="Figure 4" title="Figure 4" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 4.</span></p>
</div>

<p>The longer the ski the pleasanter you will find
it for straight-running. On a long ski you keep
your balance more easily, run more smoothly on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
rough ground, and keep a straight course with
less trouble. A short ski is slightly easier for
turning, but if you learn correct methods of
turning, the difference is insignificant; and in
any case, however much you
may twist and turn, you are
bound for the greater part of
the time to be running straight,
and you might as well do so
as comfortably as possible.</p>

<p>The ski should be as narrow
as possible, hardly more than
2&frac34; inches (7 centimetres) at
the narrowest part&mdash;<em>i.e.</em> where
the foot rests on it&mdash;even for
the biggest man.</p>

<p>If it measures 2&frac34; inches in
width at the narrowest part,
it should be about 3&frac34; inches
wide at the front bend, and
just over 3 inches at the heel.</p>

<p>A narrow ski is in every
way better than a wide one;
the only object of increasing the width of
a ski is to make its bearing surface on the
snow proportionate to the weight of a heavier
man, and so to prevent it from sinking more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
deeply and therefore running more slowly.
But this should be done by increasing the length
rather than the width.</p>

<p>The beginner usually imagines that the wider
the ski the more easily he will be able to balance
on it. This is a great mistake. A narrow ski is
far steadier than a wide one for straight running;
it is easier for turning, and infinitely more comfortable
for moving across
a steep slope of hard snow,
the diminished leverage
putting less strain on the
ankles, as the diagram
shows.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<div class="figleft">
<a id="fig05"></a><img src="images/fig05.jpg" width="150" height="131" alt="Figure 5" title="Figure 5" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 5.</span></p>
</div>

<p>The thickness of the
ski is proportionate to its
elasticity and the weight of the runner, being
about 1&frac14; inches at the binding and <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> inch at
the front bend and the heel. A stiff ski runs
rather less comfortably than a thinner and more
flexible one, but it is safer to choose a ski of
ample thickness near the binding, especially if it
is to be used for jumping.</p>

<p>The turn up at the front of the ski should
begin at about one-fifth of the distance from the
tip to the heel end. <em>It should be very gradual</em>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
for a sudden bend makes the ski run more slowly
and far less smoothly. The under side of the tip
need not be more than five inches above the
ground.</p>

<p>There is a slight upward arch between the
front bend and the heel. It should be no more
than &frac34; of an inch high at its highest point, below
the heel of the boot, only just sufficient to prevent
the ski when resting on soft snow from bending
downwards in the middle under the weight of the
runner. The height of this arch should therefore
vary slightly according to the length and stiffness
of the ski, and to the runner&#8217;s weight.</p>

<p>Of course any twist in the ski will prevent it
from running true. A simple way of making sure
that a ski is free from any such twist is as follows:
draw a few lines across its sole, at right angles
to a line down the middle of it, and, holding the
ski so that a very much fore-shortened view of
the sole is obtained, see if all these lines are
parallel.</p>

<p>Nothing is more uncomfortable and difficult to
run on than a ski which has become warped and
has a downward bend in the middle. To prevent
this happening and to preserve the upward arch,
a pair of skis, when not in use, should be placed
sole to sole and bound together at the front bend
and the heel, with a block of wood about 1&frac34;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
inches thick put between them 8 inches or so
behind the binding, just where the boot-heel rests
on the ski.</p>

<p>Most skis are made with a groove running along
the middle of the sole from the front bend to the
heel. This groove greatly increases the ski&#8217;s
steadiness in straight-running, and on no account
should be omitted. A smooth-soled ski makes
turning easier for the runner <em>who has not learnt
the right way to do it</em>, but this slight advantage
by no means compensates for the wobbliness in
straight-running which it entails. If you want
easy steering, choose extra-<em>flexible</em> skis, but <em>not</em>
grooveless or extra-short ones.</p>

<p>Most of the ordinary foot-bindings are fixed to
the ski by means of a hole bored from side to side
through its thickest part. See that this hole is
made almost entirely in the upper half of the ski&#8217;s
thickness, well away from the sole. When lifted
by a strap passed through this hole, the ski
should point downwards at an angle of about 45
degrees.</p>

<p>In order that they shall be stronger in relation
to their weight and less flexible, skis are sometimes
made with a convex, instead of a flat upper-surface.
The increased stiffness makes them less
comfortable for ordinary running but safer for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
jumping. The convexity should always stop short
of the beginning of the front bend.</p>

<p><a href="#fig06">Fig. 6</a> shows that it depends on how this
convexity is obtained as to whether and how
it is an advantage or otherwise. Supposing the
wood in each case to be of exactly the same
quality, <span class="smcap">b</span> will obviously be not only stiffer but
heavier than <span class="smcap">a</span>, <span class="smcap">c</span> will be stiffer but no heavier,
<span class="smcap">d</span> will be equally stiff but lighter. It is evident,
then, that one cannot say off-hand that the
convex shape is either better or worse than the
flat, but only that, <em>weight for weight</em>, the convex
shape gives greater stiffness and strength, the flat
gives more elasticity.</p>

<p><em>The Binding.</em>&mdash;The question of the binding, by
which the ski is fastened to the foot, is a very
vexed one; I shall treat it as shortly as I can.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>The binding should, if possible, fulfil the following
conditions:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) It should be light; (2) should be easily adjusted
to fit the boot; (3) should admit of being
quickly and easily fastened and unfastened;
(4) should be difficult to break and easy to
mend; (5) should allow fairly free vertical movement
of the foot, but limit its lateral movement
enough to make steering easy; (6) should be
comfortable, and not likely to injure the runner
in case of a fall.</p>

<p>There are innumerable forms of binding on the
market, not one of which is absolutely satisfactory
in every respect; the choice of a binding
is largely a matter of taste. But, though it is
not possible to say that any one binding is the
best, it is possible to say that certain forms are
more generally popular than others. The reader
who is not a novice probably knows all there is
to be said for and against the more common
forms; while to give a long description of several
kinds of bindings, setting forth their various good
and bad points, would be more likely to confuse
a novice than to help him to choose one that
suited him. I shall therefore describe one binding
only, the Huitfeldt, which is by far the most
generally popular one, especially in Norway, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
shall show how it answers to the above-mentioned
requirements.</p>

<p>The Huitfeldt binding (<a href="#fig07">Fig. 7</a>) consists of an
iron, leather-lined toe-piece which is passed
through the hole in the ski and bent up at each
side; a short strap passing over the toes and
connecting the ends of the metal toe-piece; and
a long strap which passes through the hole in
the ski and round the heel of the boot.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a id="fig07"></a><img src="images/fig07.jpg" width="400" height="227" alt="Figure 7" title="Figure 7" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 7.</span></p>
<p class="caption2">Huitfeldt binding, with Ellefsen clamp X (left foot).</p>
</div>

<p>A third strap, which passes under the waist
of the boot, prevents the heel-strap from slipping
up the side of the foot, as it is sometimes
inclined to do when the heel is much raised;
and a fourth strap, crossing the foot behind the
toe-strap, prevents the heel-strap from slipping
under the boot sole at the side. The heel-strap,
however, will often be found to keep in place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
perfectly without these two straps, or, at any
rate, without the latter, and in that case there
is no object in keeping them on the binding.</p>

<p>The ski is fastened on and taken off without
buckling or unbuckling the straps when once
they have been properly adjusted. In order to
put on the ski, simply push the foot well home
between the toe-irons, and then pull the heel-strap
up over the boot-heel.</p>

<p>The toe-strap may be quite loose; the heel-strap
must be so tight that it is only just possible
to force it over the boot-heel.</p>

<p>The toe-irons must be hammered or bent (a
heavy screw-wrench is useful for this) to fit the
sole of the boot exactly, so that when the boot
is pushed home between them the centre of the
heel lies in the very middle of the ski. This
means that for boots of an ordinary shape the
inside toe-iron must be more nearly parallel to
the side of the ski than the outside one, as in
diagram; otherwise the boot-heel will rest on
the inner side of the ski (<a href="#fig08">Fig. 8</a>).</p>

<p>If the toe-irons show any tendency to wobble,
small wooden wedges may be driven between
them and the side of the cavity in the ski, but
by the <em>sides</em> of the toe-irons, not <em>below</em> them,
or the ski may split.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>The toe-irons should be so adjusted that when
the boot is pushed right home the toe only projects
a little way beyond the toe-strap (see <a href="#fig07">Fig.
7</a>). If the toe-strap crosses the foot too far back,
it does not allow a free
enough movement when
the heel is raised, and
in a fall forward may
sprain the foot.</p>

<p>If the fastening fits
properly there should be
enough freedom to allow
the knee just to touch
the front of the ski.</p>

<div class="figright">
<a id="fig08"></a><img src="images/fig08.jpg" width="186" height="200" alt="Figure 8" title="Figure 8" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 8.</span></p>
<p class="caption2"><span class="smcap">A A</span> right, <span class="smcap">B B</span> wrong positions
for toe-irons (left ski).</p>
</div>

<p>In order to prevent
the heel-strap from slipping
off the boot, the heel of the boot should
be made to project at the back, both top and
bottom of the projection being rounded to allow
of the strap being easily pulled on and off (see
<a href="#fig09">Fig. 9, p. 41</a>). This is a better and a simpler
arrangement than the strap and buckle at the
back of the heel with which ski-boots are often
fitted.</p>

<p>The heel-strap should be bent first <em>downwards</em>
and then backwards on each side of the ski, so
that the side of it which is uppermost within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
the cavity of the ski becomes outermost round
the foot. This arrangement increases the tension
when the heel rises.</p>

<p>It is most important that the heel-strap should
be very tight, for its tension not only limits
the vertical movement of the foot, and so makes
it possible to lift the heel of the ski, but also,
by keeping the boot firmly jammed between
the toe-irons, prevents nearly all lateral movement,
and so makes steering easy.</p>

<p>The heel-strap consists of two parts; the back
part should be fitted with a metal lever called
&#8220;The Ellefsen Shortening Clamp&#8221; (<a href="#fig07">Fig. 7</a>, <span class="smcap">x</span>).
Opening and closing this lever lengthens and
shortens the heel-strap; the strap is buckled
so that with the lever open it will just pass
over the projection on the boot-heel; it can be
thoroughly tightened up, when on, by the closing
of the lever.</p>

<p>This lever should be so fitted on the heel-strap
that it comes on the outside of the heel
near the back.</p>

<p>The advantages of the Huitfeldt binding are
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>It is very light. If fitted with the shortening
lever it can be put on and taken off in a
second or two. It is not easily broken, and is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
not difficult to mend. If properly fitted, it limits
the movement of the foot enough to give ample
steering power. It is quite comfortable, and is
most unlikely to injure the foot even in the worst
fall.</p>

<p>Its disadvantages are that great care is needed
to adjust the toe-irons so as exactly to fit the
boot, and keep it in the middle of the ski; and
that the heel-strap is rather quickly worn at
the points where it rubs against the edges of
the toe-irons. This wearing, however, can be
diminished by filing down the sharp edges of
the toe-iron where they touch the strap, and by
occasionally pulling the strap through the hole
in the ski far enough to expose another part
of it to the friction.</p>

<p>Another slight drawback lies in the fact
that the heel-strap, where it projects on each
side of the ski, diminishes the speed somewhat
by brushing against the snow; but this is hardly
worth mentioning.</p>

<p>On the whole, then, the Huitfeldt binding has
more good points than bad ones, and is just as
likely to suit the beginner permanently as any
of the other bindings, if he is obliged to buy
his skis at the outset.</p>

<p>If he is able to try two or three different bindings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
before making his choice, he no doubt will
do so; but it is not likely that he will fully
understand the pros and cons of any good binding
until he has given it a longish trial, and has
a fair practical knowledge of ski-running.</p>

<p>In any case, I strongly advise him not to
worry too much on the subject of bindings.
With all, except the very worst and least widely
used bindings, it is possible to learn to ski well,
<em>provided they fit properly</em>.</p>

<p>He should be careful to see that the middle
of the heel rests naturally on the middle of the
ski; that the foot has enough vertical freedom
to allow the knee just to touch the ski in front,
but <em>not</em> enough to allow it to touch without
considerable tension; and that the lateral movement
of the foot is very limited. If these
conditions are fulfilled, the binding will be comfortable,
safe, and will give ample steering
power.</p>

<p>In the Huitfeldt binding and several others
of the same type, the steering power and control
of the ski is obtained by the tension between
the heel-strap and toe-irons. There is another
type in which this power is obtained by a false
sole, generally made of driving-belting, which
is fixed to the ski under the toe of the boot
and is free at the heel end. This system gives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
greater, or even absolute lateral rigidity, and
is therefore more likely to injure the foot.</p>

<p>The most widely used forms of this type of
binding are the Ellefsen, a very good binding;
the Black Forest or Balata binding, in which the
false sole is fitted with a socket for the heel, a
great favourite with shopkeepers who hire out
skis, because, without adjustment, it will fit anyone
somehow&mdash;generally badly; and the Lilienfeld
binding, an Austrian invention, made almost
completely of metal, and giving absolute lateral
rigidity, but unsuitable for jumping and disliked
by most good runners.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Absolute lateral rigidity
is not only dangerous, but is quite unnecessary
for a runner who has learnt, or who means to
learn, correct methods. For in braking or steering,
when properly done, the effect is produced
by the distribution of the weight, and by vertical
pressure on the ski rather than by forcibly twisting
or pushing it sideways.</p>

<p>With any binding on the Huitfeldt principle it
is necessary to wear a boot with a wide-welted
sole which is double throughout its length, in
order that it may not buckle at the waist of the
foot under the strain of the heel-strap.</p>

<p>The part of the ski on which the foot rests<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
should be covered by a thin plate of some such
metal as brass or tin, which does not oxidise
readily. This protects the ski if nailed boots
are worn, and prevents snow from accumulating
in an uncomfortable lump under the foot. If the
boots have no nails, or if the binding has a false
sole, a plate of celluloid or linoleum is sufficient.</p>

<p><em>The Stick.</em>&mdash;The ski-runner carries either one
or two sticks. He uses them to increase his pace
on level ground, or when running down a gentle
slope; to help him in walking uphill; to steady
him when turning while standing on a slope;
and possibly, on very rare occasions, to help to
check his pace.</p>

<p>To use them while on the move, either as a
help to the balance or for steering, is the mark
of a bad runner.</p>

<p>The sticks (for two are more useful than one)
should be light; cane or hazel is the usual wood.
They should be long enough to reach two or
three inches above the elbow, when resting on
the snow.</p>

<p>At the top the stick is provided with a leather
loop to support the hand while punting. At the
other end it is shod with a metal spike, a few
inches above which a movable disc, generally
made of wicker, is attached to prevent the stick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
from sinking into the snow. Choose some disc
attachment which does <em>not</em> involve the passing of
a thong through a hole in the stick, for one of
that sort wears out very soon.</p>


<h3><a name="CLOTHING" id="CLOTHING"></a>CLOTHING</h3>

<p><em>Boots.</em>&mdash;In order to avoid frost-bite, to the
risk of which the ski-runner is often exposed, the
boots must be stout, flexible, waterproof, and
exceedingly loose&mdash;large enough, in fact, to hold
two pairs, at any rate, of the very thickest stockings
without the least pressure, especially on the
toes. Boots made on the Norwegian &#8220;Laupar&#8221;
principle are particularly
good <em>only</em> in the
respect of giving the
toes perfect freedom.</p>

<div class="figright">
<a id="fig09"></a><img src="images/fig09.jpg" width="300" height="209" alt="Figure 9" title="Figure 9" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 9.</span></p>
<p class="caption2">Boot showing rounded projection on heel;
sole of uniform thickness from toe to beginning of heel;
and metal plates (<span class="smcap">x</span>) to prevent wear of toe-iron.</p>
</div>

<p>The heel must be
very low, and, as explained
above, it should
be made to project at
the back to prevent the
heel-strap from slipping
off, if the binding has
one. For a binding of the Huitfeldt type
the sole must be thick, not only at the ball
of the foot, but at the waist; it should have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
widish welt to prevent the toe-irons from pressing
against the foot.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Where the toe-irons touch the side of the sole,
they are apt to wear a hollow, and the boot then
works gradually forwards. This can be prevented
by screwing thin plates of metal to the
side of the sole at this point. To enable the
toe-irons to hold the boot as steady as possible,
it is better that the sides of the sole should be
rather straight (though not parallel) than curved.</p>

<p>The boots should be greased or oiled often
enough to keep them quite soft and flexible.</p>

<p>Some form of felt or canvas boot-cover is a
great safeguard against frost-bite, which is a
danger that can by no means be overrated.</p>

<p>Whether the boots shall be nailed or not is a
matter of taste. Nails cut the skis and make the
snow ball between them and the boots. Boots
with no nails at all make climbing an icy path on
foot rather troublesome. If no nails are worn,
climbing irons can be carried to strap on to the
boot for walking on icy places. Most people
wear a few <em>small</em> nails, though many (myself included)
wear none. A complete rubber sole
(which grips on ice but picks up no snow) might
work even better than the &#8220;Scafe&#8221; rubber studs;
but I know these are good.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Stockings.</em>&mdash;As I have said, two or three pairs
of stockings should be worn. However waterproof
the boot, it is impossible to keep the stockings
perfectly dry owing to the condensation of
water vapour from the foot which takes place on
the inner surface of the boot. In severe cold
this wet layer freezes, and should therefore be
kept as far as possible from the foot. It is
useless, however, to fill the boot with stockings
to such an extent as to cause pressure on the
foot and check the circulation, for this is even
more likely to cause frost-bite than is insufficient
covering.</p>

<p>Most ski-runners wear a pair of the thickest
ordinary stockings, or socks, and over this a pair
of goat&#8217;s-hair socks which are more than twice
as thick. These goat&#8217;s-hair socks (or what are
generally sold as such) wear badly, and a pair of
socks of the same thickness, but made of wool,
seem just as warm.</p>

<p>Spare socks should always be carried on long
expeditions in case the pair next the feet should
get wet through.</p>

<p><em>Gloves.</em>&mdash;These are an important item. They
should be of mitten-shape, with a bag for the
fingers, and should have a gauntlet-shaped arm
long enough to pull well over the sleeve. Like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
the boots, they must be roomy. Felt or wool
is the usual material.</p>

<p>A canvas outer covering makes them less liable
to get wet through, for the snow sticks to it less.
It is always difficult, however, to keep them dry,
and a spare pair is often as necessary as spare
socks.</p>

<p><em>Cap.</em>&mdash;Some kind of cap which can at least be
pulled down over the ears, if not over the neck
and chin, is indispensable. As an addition or
substitute, an ample scarf or muffler is useful,
especially, perhaps, for women.</p>

<p>No hat-brim protects the eyes sufficiently to be
the least safeguard against snow-blindness. Dark
glasses should always be carried, especially above
the tree-line, and should be put on the <em>instant</em>
that any discomfort is felt from the glare.</p>

<p><em>Outer Clothing.</em>&mdash;This should be as nearly
windproof as possible, and should have a smooth
surface, for if it be hairy the snow will stick to it,
and, when that melts, the clothes will become
soaked. For this reason a sweater is not satisfactory
as the outermost garment on a long
expedition.</p>

<p>Any clothing which cannot be removed during
a climb should be fairly light and not too hot,
for climbing is often excessively hot work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>A moderately stout whipcord is perhaps as good
a material as anything.</p>

<p>In order to keep out the snow the collar of a
coat should be made to button close round the
neck, and the sleeves round the wrists.</p>

<p>The pockets should have large flaps to button.
Most English runners clothe themselves, as to
the legs, in breeches and puttees, which are a
very efficient means of keeping out the snow.
Leather gaiters are useless.</p>

<p>Until recently most Norwegians used to wear
rather close-fitting trousers which buttoned
tightly round the ankles inside the boots, and a
sort of very short puttee round the tops of the
boots themselves. For warmth, comfort, and
simplicity this system seems hard to beat.</p>

<p>All the foregoing remarks as to boots, stockings,
gloves, caps, and material, of course, apply
equally to women&#8217;s clothing.</p>

<p>Whether in addition to snowproof knickerbockers
and puttees a woman shall wear a skirt
is, of course, a matter of taste or strength of
mind. In Germany and Austria most lady ski-runners
dispense with it.</p>

<p>If a skirt is worn it is particularly important
that both it and the knickerbockers shall be of
very smooth texture, otherwise the snow which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
works up between them in a fall will not shake
out again, but will accumulate in large quantities
and soak the clothes in melting.</p>

<p>The shorter the skirt, the better as regards
comfort. Even a skirt which only just covers the
knees will touch the snow during man&oelig;uvres
which involve a semi-kneeling position.</p>

<p>As to appearance, I can assure any one who
is distressed at the apparent size of her feet
and ankles when properly clad that a longish
skirt makes them far more conspicuous than a
very short one; a skirt long enough to hide
them completely is, of course, out of the question.
If the thick goat&#8217;s-hair or woollen oversock goes
some way up the leg instead of stopping short
just above the boot, and if the puttee is thin
and smooth instead of being about half an inch
thick and woolly, a less gloomy outlook on life
will perhaps be induced.</p>

<p><em>Underclothing.</em>&mdash;Climbing a hill on skis is
generally very hot work, but one is often exposed
to the most bitter cold on the top, especially
when the sun is hidden, or when wind and sunshine
come from the same quarter, and it is
impossible to take shelter from the former
without losing the latter. This makes it very
difficult to regulate satisfactorily the thickness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
of one&#8217;s clothing. On the whole, it is perhaps
better to wear fairly light underclothing, and
to rely for warmth mainly on outer garments
which can be carried, instead of worn, during the
climb.</p>

<p>If light clothing is worn, two extra sweaters
or cardigans may well be carried. In this case
they must never be forgotten, but must be carried
<em>always</em>, no matter what the weather may be, for it
may change quickly without the least warning,
and, in any case, there is often a bitter wind
high up when the heat is almost tropical in the
valley.</p>

<p>A windproof coat of thin oil-silk or of a kind of
paper-cloth made by a Paris firm, is a very good
substitute for a spare sweater. It is warmer,
lighter, and takes up hardly any space.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The following things are very useful, some of
them indispensable on a long expedition. They
can mostly be bought ready made, and I shall
not attempt a description where their application
is obvious.</p>

<p>Wax, either in a block or a collapsible tube,
which is used to prevent wet snow from sticking
to the ski. It is smeared on the ski and rubbed
in with a rag. It is better, if possible, to do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
this before starting out; or, at any rate, to
dry the ski first.</p>

<p>A good knife.</p>

<p>Some blunt instrument for scraping ice off the
ski without injuring the wood.</p>

<p>A metal ski-tip to fit on the ski, if the point
is broken off and lost. A few tools for mending
a broken ski&mdash;gimlet, screw-driver, and punch
(unless the knife is fitted with these); perhaps
also a hammer, saw, and file. Small cases of tools
with a common handle can be bought.</p>

<p>One or two small steel plates and pieces of
sheet brass or zinc with holes bored in them, and
a few screws to fit
them; or a clamp<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
consisting of two
metal plates connected
by two bolts
with wing-nuts.</p>

<p>Spare parts of the
binding itself may be carried in case it breaks,
and a thong of raw hide about two yards long,
with a loop at one end, is often useful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>This thong, when used as a substitute for the
Huitfeldt heel-strap, constitutes what is known
as the Lapp binding. This is a most firm and
comfortable binding, especially for jumping, but
since it cannot be adjusted quickly nor with
gloved hands, is unsuitable for occasions which
involve frequent taking
off and putting on of
the skis, or exposure to
extreme cold.</p>

<p><a href="#fig11">Fig. 11</a> explains the
arrangement of the
thong.</p>

<div class="figright">
<a id="fig11"></a><img src="images/fig11.jpg" width="250" height="146" alt="Figure 11" title="Figure 11" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 11.</span></p>
</div>

<p>When arranged as above so that it passes
twice round the heel of the boot, the thong is
hauled perfectly taut and made fast.</p>

<p>This can be done in slightly different ways;
I find the following a satisfactory one. Arrange
the thong so that, when it is pulled tight, the
points <span class="smcap">a b</span> are about an inch in front of the heel
of the boot, the loop <span class="smcap">a</span> being on the outside of
the foot. Then pass the free end under the
waist of the foot, up across the thongs on the
inner side, over the instep, and back to <span class="smcap">a</span>,
finishing with a half-hitch round both parts
of the thong at <span class="smcap">a</span>. If this half-hitch is made
with the end of the thong pushed through it in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
a bight, it can be pulled undone like a bow,
which is an advantage when the thong is frozen
hard.</p>

<p>A few yards of strong cord, some string, and
some brass wire are often useful.</p>

<p>A ski may be prevented from slipping backwards
in hill-climbing by tying one end of a
piece of cord to its tip, passing a few half hitches
round it at intervals, hauling all taut, and tying
the other end of the cord to the binding. This,
however, makes it necessary to lift the ski forward
at each step instead of sliding it.</p>

<p>The only satisfactory preventive of back-slip
is a strip of sealskin fastened underneath the ski;
this also prevents wet snow from sticking to the
ski, as it sometimes does in masses almost too
heavy to lift. To prevent back-slip a strip half
the length of the ski is sufficient; for sticky
snow, however, it is of course better for the ski
to be quite covered. Which of the many forms
of detachable sealskin in the market work the
best I am not competent to say, having so far
managed to do without it. There is no doubt
that sealskin is a great labour saver. With its
help it is possible to climb so much more quickly
than without, that for long mountain tours it is
almost indispensable. Moreover, when it is used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
for the climb, the soles of the skis can be kept
polished or varnished to a degree of slipperiness
that prevents even the worst of sticky snow from
being much hindrance during the run down.</p>

<p>The rucksack, in which these things, spare
clothing, food, &amp;c., are carried, should be very
large, snowproof and strong, but not heavy.
Its straps should be wide at the shoulder and
long.</p>

<p>About food, or the special equipment necessary
for mountaineering, or any other special
application of ski-running, I shall not attempt
to speak, this book being only concerned with
what is absolutely necessary to the ski-runner
<em>quâ</em> ski-runner.</p>

<p><em>Putting on Skis.</em>&mdash;Lay the skis side by side
on the snow.</p>

<p>In order to put on the right ski, place the
<em>left</em> foot on it just behind the binding as in <a href="#fig12">Fig.
12</a>, the toe of the boot being on the left side
of the ski and the heel on the
right. Your weight then holds
the ski steady while you push
the right foot well home and
fasten the binding. Now lift the
right foot and ski, stand them on
the left ski in a similar way, and
fasten that to the foot.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<a id="fig12"></a><img src="images/fig12.jpg" width="149" height="300" alt="Figure 12" title="Figure 12" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 12.</span></p>
</div>

<p>On a hill-side lay the skis
<em>across</em> the slope; stand <em>below</em>
them, and put on the <em>lower</em> ski
first, bringing the foot to it across
the front of the other leg.</p>

<p><em>On the Level.</em>&mdash;The ski-runner moves on the
level with an action much like that of ordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
walking, except that he does not lift his skis
from the snow, but slides them along it.</p>

<p>Hold your skis <em>exactly parallel</em> and as close
together as possible&mdash;not more than two inches
apart&mdash;and take a long, easy, lunging step, keeping
the knee of the advancing leg well over the
foot, and leaning the body well forwards (<a href="#plate01">Plate I.</a>).</p>

<p>Move the stick, or sticks, in time with the
opposite leg, giving a push at each, or at every
alternate stride, according as you carry two sticks
or one.</p>

<p>Slide as far as you can after the advanced foot
has received the weight, and don&#8217;t be in a hurry
to bring forward the other one.</p>

<p>The body must be swayed slightly from side
to side with each step in order to balance it
well over the ski which carries the weight.</p>

<p>If you wish to get up the greatest possible speed
on the level with two sticks, take three running&mdash;not
sliding&mdash;steps, swinging the sticks forwards
with the first two, and, at the third, giving a
push with both sticks, followed by a long slide.</p>

<p>Then do the same again, starting with the
other foot.</p>

<p><em>Uphill.</em>&mdash;If the gradient is very slight, you
can slide straight uphill in just the same way
as on the level.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>At a rather steeper gradient (the angle depending
on the slipperiness of the snow and
the skis) you will still be able to move in the
same way, but without the extra forward slide
after the weight has come on to the advanced ski.</p>

<p>If the slope becomes still steeper you will find
that the friction is hardly enough to make the
skis hold. The moment you feel they have a
tendency to slip backwards as the weight comes
on them, walk as upright as possible, even leaning
slightly backwards, so as to bring the weight on
the heels and throw a little tension on the toe-strap.
Shorten your stride, and, instead of sliding
the skis along the snow, lift their points six inches
or so into the air as you move them forwards (but
do not let their heel ends leave the snow), and
bring them down again in front of you with a
gentle but decided stamp.</p>

<p>In making this stamping movement, take care,
as you bring the foot to the ground, to stamp it
in a direction exactly at right angles to the
surface of the slope. The least suspicion of
pawing backwards, or lunging forwards, as the
ski touches the snow is sure to make it slip.</p>

<p>By moving steadily and carefully in this way
it is possible to walk up an appreciably steeper
gradient than the one at which the skis first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
show a tendency to slip back. But it is no
use attempting to struggle or hurry; no amount
of effort will help you, and if you cannot do it
easily you cannot do it at all.</p>

<p>If the gradient becomes any steeper than
this&mdash;and except in the worst conditions of
sticky snow, the slope will still be quite gentle,
the skis will slip backwards in spite of all your
care. At the first sudden and unexpected back-slip
instinct will prompt you to throw yourself
forward, strike out with the back foot, and make
a sort of pawing movement with the advanced
one. If you do this, your skis will slip from
under you and you will fall on your nose. Do
nothing of the sort, therefore, but the moment
the ski slips lean <em>right backwards</em>, with a free
swing of the body, at the same time lifting the
slipping ski quickly round behind the heel of, and
to right angles with, the other ski, to stop you
(<a href="#plate02">Plate II.</a>). To proceed as before being
now impossible, you have the choice of three
different methods: zigzagging, herring-boning,
and side-stepping.</p>

<p><em>Zigzagging.</em>&mdash;Turn more or less sideways to
the hill and then move forwards at a gradient
just easy enough to prevent back-slipping. The
skis are held as close together as possible, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
moved just as before; but now, instead of being
&#8220;flat&#8221; to the surface of the snow, they are
&#8220;edged&#8221; (cutting more deeply into it with the
edges which are nearest the hill) and one ski is
more or less above the other, according to the
steepness of the slope.</p>

<p>If the surface is very hard and icy, and the
skis cut in very little, less than half their
width may rest on the snow. In order to
lessen the muscular effort then needed to hold
the ankles vertical (see <a href="#Page_28">p. 28</a>) press both <em>knees</em>,
especially the lower one, well over towards the
hill.</p>

<p>Hold the sticks in each hand, and use them
just as before, no matter how steep the slope.
If the slope be very steep, the stick on the
uphill side can be held shorter, but the two
sticks should never (except on a dangerous
slope) be put together and held across the
body with both hands, as a climber holds his
ice-axe. To do so will only get you into a bad
habit of leaning towards the hill and supporting
yourself with the stick, and will prevent you
from balancing yourself properly and walking
freely.</p>

<p>If only one stick be used, it should be carried
in the hand which is nearest the hill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>If a steep slope is so hard and slippery that nothing
will make the edges of the skis grip, hold
the point of each stick close against the <em>downhill</em>
side of <em>each</em> foot, move the sticks exactly in unison
with the feet, and dig their points hard into
the crust at each step. This gives a perfectly
firm support for the skis and answers the purpose
of climbing-irons. It is, however, very
seldom necessary.</p>

<p>Having found the steepest gradient which you
can negotiate without back-slipping, so adjust
your course across the hill that this gradient remains
constant. That is to say, if you come to
a spot which is steeper&mdash;<em>no matter how slightly,
or for how short a distance</em>&mdash;don&#8217;t dream of
trying to move on to it without altering your
course; but instantly turn more sideways to
the hill, so that although the <em>direction</em> of your
course is altered its <em>gradient</em> remains the same
as before. By this means only will you avoid
falling on your nose, or, at any rate, struggling
and slipping uselessly.</p>

<p>Nothing is more common than to see a beginner
making frantic efforts to cross a short
bit of steeper ground without altering his course.
He could attempt nothing more hopeless.</p>

<p>It is amazing how many exhausting struggles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
and falls are usually needed to impress on a
learner the fact that it is utterly impossible for
him to advance <em>even one single step</em> on steeper
ground&mdash;however slight the difference in gradient
may be&mdash;without altering his course.</p>

<p>Of course if the slope becomes <em>less</em> steep, you
turn less sideways to the hill and mount it more
directly.</p>

<p>The diagram will, perhaps, help to explain the
proper way of moving uphill across ground of
varying gradient.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a id="fig13"></a><img src="images/fig13.jpg" width="400" height="270" alt="Figure 13" title="Figure 13" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 13.</span></p>
</div>

<p>It represents a slope with a steep-sided gully
running down it. The conformation of the
ground is indicated by contour lines, as in a
map&mdash;<em>i.e.</em> imaginary horizontal lines running<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
along the side of the hill, with the same <em>vertical</em>
distance between each pair. Where, then, the
contour lines in the plan are far apart the slope
is gradual, and <em>vice versa</em>.</p>

<p>Since the direction of the fall of the slope is
everywhere at right angles with that of the contour
lines, its <em>general</em> direction only is shown by the
arrow; at either side of the gully its <em>local</em> direction
is, of course, nearly at right angles to this.</p>

<p>AB is the track of an experienced ski-runner.
Observe that (i) in general shape the line AB
resembles the contour lines; (ii) it never cuts the
same contour twice; (iii) when the contours are
far apart it cuts them at a blunter angle than
when they are close together. In other words,
the expert (i) makes a détour at the gully; (ii)
never loses any height that he has once gained;
(iii) moves steadily uphill at a constant gradient,
facing the hill <em>more</em> directly where it is <em>less</em> steep,
and <em>vice versa</em>.</p>

<p>AC is the track of a beginner. Trying to cut
across directly towards B he runs downhill into
the gully, but, being of course unable to climb
straight up the steep slope on the far side in the
direction of B, he has to bear away to the right;
and at C, when his track from A is quite as long
as the expert&#8217;s at B, he is not nearly so far up
the hill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>Remember that the variation of contour needs
just as careful attention in its smallest details
as in its main features, and must be negotiated
in exactly the same way. In climbing in this
way it is, of course, impossible to go on continually
keeping the same side to the slope (unless
the hill is perfectly conical in shape and quite
free from obstacles, allowing one to wind round
it to the top in a spiral). Having moved in
one direction for a time, you will eventually
have to turn round and begin a fresh tack.</p>

<p>To shuffle round, as you might do on the level,
is obviously impossible; for, whether you do so
facing up or downhill, the skis will at a certain
angle begin to run away.</p>

<p>The usual procedure is to make what is known
as a kick-turn.</p>

<p><em>The Kick-Turn.</em>&mdash;Suppose that you have been
traversing the slope with the hill on your right
side and wish to make a fresh tack. Stop with
your skis pointing uphill at the angle at which
they have just been moving, and your sticks
resting close to each foot. Then put your weight
on the lower ski, and draw back the other, slightly
bending the upper knee and raising the heel (<a href="#plate03">Plate
III.</a>). Now swing your right leg from the hip
vigorously forwards and upwards, straightening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
it completely as it rises, and turning up the toe
as hard as you can, as though trying to make a
very high kick. The leg <em>must be swung freely</em>,
not merely lifted. The result of this movement,
if made with confidence, will be to bring the ski
to an upright position with its heel resting in
the snow close to the bend of the other (<a href="#plate04">Plate
IV.</a>). If there is any hesitation, the knee is sure
to remain bent, and the toe to point forward,
the result of which will be that the heel of the
ski will catch in the snow before it has moved
far enough to the front.</p>

<p>The position in <a href="#plate04">Plate IV.</a> is only momentary.
As soon as the ski is standing on end in the
snow swing its point round to the right and downwards,
until the whole ski again rests on the snow,
pointing uphill in the <em>opposite direction</em>, but at
the same angle as before (<a href="#plate05">Plate V.</a>). During
this movement the heel of the right ski remains
in the snow where it was placed at first, and
acts as a pivot. The steeper and more slippery
the slope, and the less directly you have therefore
been climbing it, the narrower, obviously,
will have to be the angle between the skis in the
position of <a href="#plate05">Plate V.</a>, but, if your joints are normally
supple, it is only on very steep or icy
slopes, when the skis have to be brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
nearly parallel, that you will find it much of a
strain to turn your feet and knees far enough
outwards.</p>

<p>Next shift the whole weight over on to the
upper leg, at the same time straightening it and
letting the other hang slightly bent; this movement
will lift the lower ski and stick just off the
snow (<a href="#plate06">Plate VI.</a>). Then <em>straightening the left
knee and turning up the toe as hard as possible</em>
(<a href="#plate07a">Plate VII., <span class="smcap">a</span></a>), face towards the point of the right
ski and bring the left ski round to the side of
it (<a href="#plate08">Plate VIII.</a>). This time, however, make no
attempt to kick or swing the leg, as you did in
turning the right ski, but <em>keep the left foot quite
close to the right as it moves round it</em>. The only
difficulty here is to keep the point of the ski
from catching in the slope above you as it turns.
On a very steep slope, in order to avoid this,
you will have to change from the position of
<a href="#plate06">Plate VI.</a> to that of <a href="#plate08">Plate VIII.</a> very quickly,
straightening the left knee and turning up the
toe <em>with a sudden jerk</em> as you do so, and also
<em>lifting the left hip</em> as much as you can. This
will for a moment throw up the <em>point</em> of the
left ski much higher than if the movement were
made slowly. But if you try to lift the <em>whole ski</em>
high above the snow with knee bent and toe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
dropped, or to swing the left leg away from
the other, the point is nearly certain to catch
(<a href="#plate07b">Plate VII., <span class="smcap">b</span></a>).</p>

<p>The left stick is moved round with the left ski,
but the point of the other stays in the same
place throughout the turn; when only one stick
is carried it should, therefore, be held in the
hand which, before the turn, is the uphill one.
The sticks of course help to steady you, but you
should be able to turn without any stick in your
hand, and should learn to do so as soon as you can.</p>

<p>Having reached the position of <a href="#plate08">Plate VIII.</a>,
you can, of course, begin a fresh tack, at the end
of which you can make another kick-turn by
reversing the words right and left in these
directions.</p>

<p>The kick-turn, as I have described it, is made
with three distinct pauses at the positions of Plates
<a href="#plate04">IV.</a>, <a href="#plate05">V.</a>, and <a href="#plate05">VI.</a> Instead, however, of starting
the turn by standing the upper ski on end and
using its heel as a pivot, it is quite possible to
do so by just lifting it far enough for its heel
to clear the front of the standing leg, turning it
in the air, and bringing it directly to its final
position on the snow in one continuous movement.
By then lifting the lower ski the instant
the other comes to rest, and turning it without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
any preliminary pause, you can make the whole
kick-turn so quickly that you hardly come to a
standstill between one tack and the next. On
a steep slope, however, it is always safer to begin
by standing the upper ski on end before turning
it, as otherwise its point is apt to catch in the snow
before it has reached the proper new position.</p>

<p>There is another very convenient modification
of the kick-turn which can be performed without
coming to a standstill at all.</p>

<p>As you come to the end of a tack with, say,
your left side to the hill, take a long step forward
with your right foot, placing the right ski
in front of the other one, pointing it uphill as
much as you can and edging it inwards (<a href="#fig14">Fig. 14</a>, <em>1</em>).
Then, throwing the weight momentarily <em>against</em>
the right ski rather than <em>on</em> it (for if you actually
stand on it it will slip backwards), take a wide
step round to the left with the left ski, putting
it down so that it points as nearly as possible
in the direction of the new tack you are about
to start, with its heel quite close to the heel
of the other ski (<a href="#fig14">Fig. 14</a>, <em>2</em>). As the left ski
comes to the snow, bring the right ski round
beside it (<a href="#fig14">Fig. 14</a>, <em>3</em>) and walk on in the new
direction. The whole process must be carried
out quickly and accurately, for if there is any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
hesitation about the first two steps you are almost
sure to slip backwards and fall on your nose.
It is, however, really very easy, except on the
steepest slopes, and is a great saving of time.
The position in the middle of the turn is much
the same as in &#8220;Herring-boning,&#8221; described later
(see <a href="#plate09">Plate IX.</a>). The sticks must be held up
out of the way of the skis.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a id="fig14"></a><img src="images/fig14.jpg" width="400" height="254" alt="Figure 14" title="Figure 14" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 14.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Another way of making the kick-turn is to go
backwards through the whole process first described.
After finishing a tack to the right,
for instance, you can move successively through
the positions of <a href="#plate07a">Plates VII<span class="smcap">a</span>.</a>, <a href="#plate06">VI.</a>, and <a href="#plate05">V.</a>, and
then lift the upper ski round to the position of
<a href="#plate03">Plate III.</a> By turning in this way, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
you lose a little height instead of gaining it;
this method is, therefore, rather more suitable
for <em>descending</em> a hill in zigzags than for
climbing it.</p>

<p>All the above ways of turning are known as
<em>uphill</em> turns because one faces the hill during
the process; it is also possible to make the kick-turn
facing <em>downhill</em> by turning the <em>lower</em> ski
first. In order to prevent strain in the intermediate
position, this downhill turn should be
both started and finished with the skis pointing
<em>downwards</em> as much as possible (<a href="#fig15">Fig. 15</a>); this
makes it particularly convenient for joining two
downhill tacks. It can also, of course, be made
backwards as well as forwards, with a slight consequent
gain instead of a loss of height. In a
downhill kick-turn the skis have more room to
move freely, but the balance is much less steady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
than if one faces the hill. On the whole, the
forward uphill turn first described is far the most
useful, but when you want to turn in cramped
corners, among trees and the like, you will
find it a great help to know several ways of
doing it.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<a id="fig15"></a><img src="images/fig15.jpg" width="250" height="107" alt="Figure 15" title="Figure 15" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 15.</span></p>
<p class="caption2">Downhill kick-turn.</p>
</div>

<p>Although, as I have said, the skis need never
be quite parallel at the middle stage of the turn,
you must take great care to bring the first ski
far enough round to prevent the least chance of
its slipping. On a steep or icy slope, where the
skis at this stage must be brought nearly parallel,
the kick-turn becomes difficult for the stiff-jointed;
I have even known two cases in which
it was apparently impossible. If, as is highly
unlikely, your case is similar, you can always roll
round on your back with your skis in the air&mdash;a
simple but snowy process.</p>

<p>If you dislike this, and if, though the <em>joints</em> of
your legs are stiff, the <em>muscles</em> are strong and
active (a not unusual combination), you can as
a last resource <em>jump</em> round, facing downhill
as you turn. The main difficulty in this is to
prevent the heels of the skis from catching in the
slope when half-way round, and the best way to
prevent them doing so is to jump as hard as possible
not directly upwards, but <em>out</em> from the hill,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
so as to land <em>below</em> where you take off. In order
to bring round the skis close beside each other,
press the <em>knees</em> together throughout the jump.
Hold the sticks near their middles, and jump
from the toes, not the flat of the foot, with a free
swinging action, not a hurried jerky one. This
jump needs little skill and is easy enough on a
moderate slope, but on a steep one becomes very
hard work, for there the skis have less room to
turn, and a powerful spring is necessary. The
jump round, therefore, being most difficult under
the same conditions as the kick-turn, and much
more tiring, is hardly a satisfactory substitute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
for it; I only mention it as a perfectly possible
one.</p>

<p class="caption2">Zigzagging without turning.</p>
</div>

<p>The accompanying <a href="#fig16">diagram</a>, which is practically
the same as one in Mr. Richardson&#8217;s book,
&#8220;The Ski-Runner,&#8221; shows how, by walking
alternately backwards and forwards, one can
climb a steep passage, just wide enough to allow
zigzagging, without wasting time in turning
at the end of each tack. A description is
unnecessary. It is, of course, possible to make
the tacks of any length, but the number of
steps in each must always be an even one, as
the tack must be started with the upper foot and
finished with the lower.</p>

<p><em>Half Side-stepping.</em>&mdash;In tacking uphill among
obstacles you may want to traverse at an angle
so steep that the skis would back-slip if you tried
to move straight forward in the ordinary way.
You will then have to step sideways as well as
forwards with each ski, the upper one starting
the process and the lower one being drawn up to
it, and then advanced. <a href="#fig17">Fig. 17</a>, <span class="smcap">a</span>, shows the
track that will be left.</p>

<p>This must of course be done without pointing
the skis uphill more steeply than the angle at
which they could traverse in the ordinary way.
In lifting the upper ski sideways you are sure at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
first to point it uphill too much (<a href="#fig17">Fig. 17</a>, <span class="smcap">b</span> <em>3</em>),
when, if it does not slip back at once, you will
tread on it with the heel of the lower ski at the
next step (<a href="#fig17">Fig. 17</a>, <span class="smcap">b</span> <em>4</em>). To avoid this, do your
best at first to place the upper ski <em>horizontally</em>
across the slope, lifting its <em>heel</em> well upwards and
away from the other, pointing the foot downwards
and inwards, and turning your body so as
to face a little downhill.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p>On open ground, if the snow is so slippery
that the gradient of an ordinary straightforward
traverse has to be very slight indeed, this half
side-stepping can be used simply to save time.
Especial care must then be taken to place the
upper ski nearly horizontally. Half side-stepping
can be kept up for a long time without difficulty;
but it is more tiring than ordinary straightforward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
traversing, and I think it is a waste of
energy to employ it constantly when there is no
special reason for it, as some runners are fond
of doing.</p>

<p><em>Side-stepping.</em>&mdash;It is, of course, also possible to
side-step directly uphill with the skis quite horizontal,
as in <a href="#fig18">Fig. 18</a>,
but this, though very
easy, is such a tiresome
process that it is seldom
used except in narrow
passages where there is
room for nothing else, or for climbing short
slopes that are very steep and icy.</p>

<p><em>Herring-boning</em> (<a href="#plate09">Plate IX.</a>).&mdash;This is the quickest
but far the most tiring way of going straight
up a steep slope. Stand with skis together
pointing as much uphill as they can without
slipping. Lift the upper ski, and, keeping the
feet close together, turn it until it points across
the hill in the opposite direction, but <em>at the same
angle as before</em>, with its heel across that of the
other. Then slide it forwards until it just clears
the lower one; stand up on it and draw up the
lower foot so that the skis are again crossed at
the back at the same angle as before, but with
the hitherto lower ski uppermost. You can now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
take a new step in the other direction, and so on.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
<a href="#fig19">Fig. 19</a> shows the track. The steeper the slope
the wider must be the angle between the skis
to prevent them from slipping back, but you can
always, if you find it difficult
to turn the feet enough outwards,
point the skis uphill
more steeply than would
otherwise be possible, by
simply throwing the weight
momentarily <em>against</em> rather
than <em>on to</em> each ski (see
<a href="#Page_65">p. 65</a>), and keeping the feet
well apart the whole time
instead of bringing them together
between each step.
But though this is a quicker
method, it is a still more
tiring one than the first.</p>

<p class="caption2">Herring-boning.</p>
</div>

<p>If the slope is steep, herring-boning is too exhausting
to be kept up for more than a short
time by anyone but a trained athlete, but on a
gradient which will allow the skis to diverge at
only a slight angle it is easy enough.</p>

<p><em>Getting up from a Fall.</em>&mdash;If during any of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
these man&oelig;uvres you should fall down, you may
find some difficulty in getting up again.</p>

<p>The first problem is to disentangle the skis,
if they have become jammed in a complicated
position.</p>

<p>The best way to do this is generally to begin
by moving your body as far away from them
as possible. If, for instance, you have fallen
with your head downhill, wriggle yourself still
farther downhill. Next lift your skis into the
air, either by rolling on your back and raising
the legs from the hips, or by rolling on to
your face and bending the legs backwards from
the knees. It is generally possible to free the
skis in this way, but occasionally one cannot
move without unfastening them first.</p>

<p>Having freed them, place them parallel in the
air, and roll round on your side so as to bring
them to the snow on the downhill side of you
and exactly at right angles to the fall of the
slope.</p>

<p>This is important, for, if they are pointing
either up or down hill, they will, of course, begin
to slip the moment you put your weight on
them.</p>

<p>If they are quite level, and your feet are
exactly below your body, you have merely to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
push yourself up with the arm which is underneath
you and stand erect. If you want to
help yourself up with your stick, do not poke
it vertically into the snow and try to climb
up it, for if the snow is deep and soft you
will only plunge it farther in without getting
any resistance. <span class="u">Lay it horizontally</span> on the snow,
and it will then give you enough purchase to
push up from.</p>

<p>On level ground it is harder to get up again
than on a hill side, owing to the difficulty of
getting the skis underneath one in order to get
to one&#8217;s feet. After freeing them and placing
them parallel, lie on your side, draw your knees
as close to your chest, and your feet as close
to your thighs as you can, lay your stick flat
under your side, and, with a vigorous push on
it, you ought to be able to get your weight
over the skis and stand up.</p>

<p>Never hurry, or try to struggle frantically
to your feet without any definite method. You
will merely exhaust yourself. It is impossible,
as a rule, to get up without going through the
various man&oelig;uvres that I have described, but
these take a very short time if they are performed
smartly and accurately.</p>

<h3><a name="GENERAL_PRINCIPLES_OF_STEERING_ETC" id="GENERAL_PRINCIPLES_OF_STEERING_ETC"></a>GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF STEERING, <span class="smcap">Etc.</span></h3>


<p>This chapter is mildly theoretical, and may be
skipped by the reader who believes in nothing
that is not, in the ordinary sense of the word,
practical; for in it he will find no definite instructions,
but only a description of the behaviour,
under different conditions, of the skis
when in motion, and an attempt at an explanation
of it.</p>

<p>I advise him, however, to try to read it, for
I think that what I have to say here is, in a
broad sense, strictly practical. I am convinced
at any rate, that if, when I began ski-ing, some
one had given me the information which I am
about to try to impart, and which, for the most
part, I have slowly collected for myself, I could
have reached in a month the very moderate
degree of skill which it has taken me five seasons
or so to arrive at.</p>

<p>If the reader can thoroughly grasp the few
facts with which this chapter is concerned&mdash;and
he can take my word for the facts, whatever
he may think about my comments on them&mdash;he
will, I think, find it far easier to understand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
remember, and put into practice the instructions
which he will find in the subsequent chapters,
as to the various swings, turns, and other
man&oelig;uvres for controlling and steering the
skis, and keeping the balance while running
downhill.</p>

<p>Before proceeding any further, I had better,
in order to avoid any chance of being misunderstood,
explain certain terms of which I shall
constantly make use throughout the rest of the
book. These terms are the &#8220;edging&#8221; and &#8220;flattening&#8221;
of the skis, and the &#8220;inside&#8221; and
&#8220;outside&#8221; of a curve.</p>

<p>If any reader feels that an explanation of
these terms is an insult to his intelligence, I
can only assure him that such an explanation
has been necessary in the case of many of my
pupils.</p>

<p>The terms &#8220;edging&#8221; and &#8220;flattening&#8221; simply
have reference to the relation of the plane of
the ski&#8217;s sole with that of the general surface
on which it is resting, and do not refer to its
relation with a horizontal plane, or, in other
words, to its position in space.</p>

<p>Thus a ski is &#8220;flat&#8221; when standing in the
normal position on level ground; but, when
standing in the normal position on the side of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
a slope, it is <em>not</em> &#8220;flat,&#8221; but &#8220;edged,&#8221; for in this
case the edge nearest the hill cuts deeper into
the snow than the other although the plane of
the sole is still horizontal. (<a href="#fig20">Fig. 20</a>, <span class="smcap">a</span> and <span class="smcap">b</span>.)</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a id="fig20"></a><img src="images/fig20.jpg" width="400" height="317" alt="Figure 20" title="Figure 20" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 20.</span></p>
<p class="caption2">Edging and flattening.</p>
</div>

<p>The case is altered when the ski is inclined
sideways; on level ground a ski that is
inclined sideways is &#8220;edged&#8221; (<span class="smcap">c</span> and <span class="smcap">e</span>); but on
the side of a hill a ski when inclined sideways
so that the plane of its sole becomes parallel with
that of the surface of the slope, is <em>not</em> &#8220;edged&#8221;
but &#8220;flat&#8221; (<span class="smcap">d</span>). When inclined to the opposite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
side, however, it is, of course, &#8220;edged&#8221; even
more strongly than in the normal position (<span class="smcap">f</span>).</p>

<p>The inside and outside of a curve mean, respectively,
the sides nearest to, and farthest
from, the centre of the circle of which that curve
is an arc; that is to say, that in speaking of
a swing or a turn to the right, the right ski,
foot, and so forth are the inside, and the left the
outside ones, while in the case of a turn to the
left it is just the reverse.</p>

<p>This is simple enough. A shade of ambiguity,
however, may lie in the fact that the edges of
a ski are generally called &#8220;inside&#8221; and &#8220;outside&#8221;
with reference to their relation to the foot, in
the same way as those of a skate. In speaking,
then, of swings or turns, the right edge, say, of
the right ski may be referred to as its &#8220;outside&#8221;
edge, even when the right ski itself, and the
right leg, shoulder, and so on are all the inner
ones in relation to the curve of the swing.</p>

<p>Now for the facts referred to above.</p>

<p>When a ski is pointed directly downhill and is
made to slide with its sole held flat on the snow,
it runs, if properly constructed, in a perfectly
straight line.</p>

<p>If it is then &#8220;edged&#8221; to one side it runs
round gradually to that side, the curved point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
acting against the snow like a bow rudder and
drawing it to that side.</p>

<p>The steering effect, in theory, increases with
the edging until it reaches its maximum when
the ski is edged to a right angle. What happens
in practice is that though the edging and
the steering effect do increase together, there is
no use in edging the ski beyond a certain angle&mdash;less
than 45°&mdash;as, if that angle is exceeded, the ski
sinks deeply into the snow and refuses to slide.</p>

<p>If that angle is not exceeded, however, the
deeper the ski sinks into the snow (owing to
the softness of the latter) the greater is the
steering effect, for then a larger and more sharply
curved surface of the point comes into action as a
rudder.</p>

<p>If when going straight downhill the runner
&#8220;edges&#8221; his ski&mdash;we will suppose he has only
one&mdash;<em>by simply leaning sideways</em>, he will equally
simply fall down; but if he &#8220;edges&#8221; it <em>without
leaning</em>&mdash;if he edges it <em>in relation to himself</em>, so
to speak&mdash;it will begin to turn; that he then
leans sideways in order to keep his balance does
not make the turn sharper.</p>

<p>If the runner traverses the slope with his ski
held normally, as in <a href="#fig20">Fig. 20</a>, <span class="smcap">b</span>, it will run
straight, for although it is then edged in relation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
to the slope it is not edged in relation to him. If
he edges it in relation to himself it will turn
more or less according as the gradient of its
previous traverse has been steep or gradual.</p>

<p>When a ski running straight downhill is made
to turn by &#8220;edging,&#8221; the further it turns, and
the less directly therefore it points downhill, the
less abrupt becomes the curve of its course. This
curve, indeed, eventually becomes so gradual
that before the ski has turned far enough to point
horizontally across the slope and come to a standstill,
the line of its track is practically straight.</p>

<p>When, therefore, a ski, traversing directly at
a moderate gradient, is simply &#8220;edged&#8221; towards
the slope, there is no perceptible turning effect,
even if the runner does not lean inwards.</p>

<p>At first sight it might appear that the movement
of a ski when edged and travelling in
a curve would be precisely similar to that of a
skate, and so it is in a way.</p>

<p>Since the edge of a skate is, in shape, the arc
of a circle, a skate, when edged, cuts cleanly
round without side-slip, and so in a sense does a
ski, when simply edged, for its heel then follows in
the track of its point. An edged ski, moreover, like
a skate, turns more or less gradually, according
to the angle at which it is edged. But while a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
skate, the edge of which is curved throughout,
touches the ice with only a very small part of
this edge, and is able to make a curve of very
small radius, a ski touches the snow with nearly
the whole length of its edge,
the greater part of which is
quite straight. This straight
part so far neutralises the
turning action of the curved
point, that a ski made to turn
simply by edging is unable to
make anything but a very
long and gradual curve&mdash;so
gradual, indeed, that for practical
purposes of steering the
edging of the ski, <em>unaided</em>, is
absolutely useless.</p>

<div class="figright">
<a id="fig21"></a><img src="images/fig21.jpg" width="212" height="300" alt="Figure 21" title="Figure 21" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 21.</span></p>
</div>

<p>But though, contrary to
what one might expect, the
edging or flattening
of the skis may
practically be disregarded
as <em>primary</em>
factors in a turn, they are, as we shall see,
of the greatest importance as <em>secondary</em> ones.</p>

<p>Before a ski can be made to turn at all sharply,
its heel must be got out of the track of its point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
and made to travel faster on a curve of its own
(as in <a href="#fig21">Fig. 21</a>, <span class="smcap">b</span>). The ski as a whole, in fact,
must be made to side-slip more or less as well
as move forward.</p>

<p>The first question, then, is how the ski-heel is to
be got out of the track of the point in order that
the side-slip may start. If the ski is pointing
nearly directly downhill, whether flat and
running straight, or moving edged in a long
curve, there is&mdash;apart from the help of the other
ski, which we will leave out of the question for
the present&mdash;only one possible way of doing it.
The runner, by means of sudden&mdash;though not
necessarily more than a very slight&mdash;muscular
effort must jerk it more or less broadside on.
How he makes this effort need not be considered
here; we will also defer the consideration of the
other ways in which the side-slip may be started.
Supposing it has been started, it must then, by
edging or flattening, be encouraged to continue,
if the ski is to go on turning.</p>

<p>It depends on the quality of the snow as to
whether a ski side-slips more freely when flat
or when more or less edged. If the surface of
the snow is hard and icy, or if there is a mere
shallow layer of loose snow on a hard crust, a
ski will slip sideways either when quite flat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
or when slightly or even strongly edged on the
side <em>from</em> which it is moving.</p>

<p>The flat position would in this case be the more
favourable if the hard surface were perfectly
smooth; this, however, it seldom is; it usually
has small projections which, when the ski is quite
flat, strike its side and check or stop it, while, if
the edge is raised, they strike its sole obliquely
and affect its motion but little.</p>

<p>The flat position, then, is not advisable as
an aid to side-slip even in the case of hard
snow; on snow of any other kind it is still
less advisable, for if the ski sinks deeply into
loose soft snow, or even but a little way into
dense soft snow or into a thin crust, it can
hardly be induced to side-slip at all when held
quite flat, while when more or less edged, it
can usually (if already in motion) be made to
do so without much difficulty.</p>

<p>The reason is not quite obvious, for at first
glance it would appear that the ski would meet
more resistance from the snow in the edged
position than in the flat, but this is not the
case, for, when the ski is edged, most of the
resistance is exerted <em>obliquely</em> against its sole,
and so tends to make the ski rise to the surface
of the snow and relieves the pressure. When,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
however, the ski is flat, the resistance acts
<em>directly</em> against the side of it, and there is no
lifting tendency to diminish the rapidity with
which this resistance increases as the snow is
compressed.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a id="fig22"></a><img src="images/fig22.jpg" width="400" height="207" alt="Figure 22" title="Figure 22" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 22.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Moreover, since during a turn the runner must
lean inwards to keep his balance, the ski cannot
remain in its normal position in relation to the
leg unless it is more or less edged inwards (<a href="#fig22">Fig.
22</a>, <span class="smcap">a</span>). That the leg and ski should remain
as nearly as possible in their normal relative
positions is an advantage, for the more nearly
they do so the less is the strain on the ankle.
If the weighted ski is held quite flat during
a turn in which it is outermost, that ankle is
placed in a very unstable position (<a href="#fig22">Fig. 22</a>, <span class="smcap">b</span>),
and is liable to give way and so edge the ski<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
on that side <em>towards</em> which it is moving (<a href="#fig22">Fig.
22</a>, <span class="smcap">c</span>); it will then cut more deeply into the
snow and be brought instantly to a standstill.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a id="fig23"></a><img src="images/fig23.jpg" width="400" height="285" alt="Figure 23" title="Figure 23" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 23.</span></p>
</div>

<p>In all that I have said so far about side-slip,
I have assumed that the ski is moving more or
less broadside on, with its heel travelling outside
the track of its tip and its pivoting point
well forward, and this is what either one or
both skis actually do during the greater part
of any swing or turn; for, in turning, a ski
usually passes through the positions of either <span class="smcap">b</span>
or <span class="smcap">c</span>, <a href="#fig23">Fig. 23</a>. A ski may also, as, for instance,
in turning downwards from a slow traverse, move<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
so that the curve in which its point travels
is outside that of the heel (<a href="#fig23">Fig. 23</a>, <span class="smcap">d</span>) and its
pivoting point is near the heel. In each of
these cases, though one end is side-slipping
faster than the other, both ends are slipping
to the <em>same side</em>, and the ski, as I have said,
has therefore to be edged to the <em>opposite
side</em>.</p>

<p>If, however, the ski begins to turn as in
<span class="smcap">d</span>, and finishes as in <span class="smcap">b</span> or <span class="smcap">c</span>, it must of
course be edged first to one side and then to
the other, as in <span class="smcap">e</span>, and for a moment be
flat. At this moment the pivoting point of the
ski is at its centre, and its heel is side-slipping
in one direction as much as its point is in the
other, as in <span class="smcap">a</span>. If ever, therefore, a ski, in
turning, <em>continues</em> to pivot on its centre (<a href="#fig23">Fig.
23</a>, <span class="smcap">a</span>) instead of only doing so for a moment, it
must obviously be held quite flat, as otherwise
either one end or the other will cut below the
surface of the snow and be checked suddenly.</p>

<p>Now the pivoting point of a ski is never
behind its centre except during a downward
turn, and the faster the runner is moving
before the turn, and the sharper the turn is
made, the more quickly this point moves to
the front; the only case, I believe, in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
it remains near the centre for an appreciable
time, and when, therefore, the ski has to be
held deliberately flat, being that of the outer ski
during a &#8220;steered&#8221; Christiania swing.</p>

<p>In order to facilitate side-slip, therefore, the
outer edge of the ski must usually be raised as
it turns or, even if at first the inner edge must
be raised, a change of edge must usually take
place almost immediately. The flat position, in
fact, must never be sustained&mdash;except, as I have
said, during a Christiania &#8220;steered&#8221; swing,
and even then only for a short time&mdash;it is
simply a necessary incident in a change of
edge.</p>

<p>In each figure in <a href="#fig23">Diagram 23</a> the dotted line
with arrows shows the <em>average</em> direction of the
ski&#8217;s course at each point, and whether, therefore,
it must be edged or flat.</p>

<p>The foregoing remarks are an explanation of
how the edging or flattening of the ski can be
made to help the side-slip; the next thing is to
understand how the side-slip can be made to
help the ski to turn sharply.</p>

<p>If, when either standing still on the side of a
slope or running across it in the normal, edged
position, a ski is partially flattened, it will begin
to slip sideways&mdash;in the first case moving directly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
downhill, and in the second obliquely, <em>i.e.</em> forwards
as well as sideways.</p>

<p>Now the foot stands on the ski at about halfway
between the front bend and the heel&mdash;that
is to say, about the middle of that part of the
blade which rests on the snow; and as long as
the runner&#8217;s weight is placed equally on toe and
heel, a ski in side-slipping will continue to point
in a direction parallel to that in which it was
pointing when the side-slip began.</p>

<p>When, however, the runner&#8217;s weight is placed
on the heel, that end of the ski will side-slip
faster than the other, and the farther the ski
slips the more it will point uphill; while when
the weight is placed on the toe the reverse will
happen.</p>

<p><a href="#fig24">Fig. 24</a> shows what will happen if a ski, when
(<span class="smcap">a</span>, <span class="smcap">b</span>, <span class="smcap">c</span>) at rest on, or (<span class="smcap">d</span>, <span class="smcap">e</span>, <span class="smcap">f</span>) running across a
slope, is made to side-slip with the runner&#8217;s
weight variously distributed. In this and succeeding
diagrams the blackened portions of the
skis are those on which the runner&#8217;s weight
is put.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<a id="fig24"></a><img src="images/fig24.jpg" width="400" height="341" alt="Figure 24" title="Figure 24" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 24.</span></p>
</div>

<p>In <span class="smcap">a</span> the ski slips broadside on downhill.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">b</span> it gradually revolves as it slips, and
would finish by running downhill backwards if
its shape did not prevent it from doing so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">c</span> its rotation is reversed, and it finally runs
straight downhill.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">d</span> it runs slightly sideways, but the direction
of its course is a straight line.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">e</span> it turns uphill and at a certain point stops.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">f</span> it at first turns and finally runs
straight downhill.</p>

<p>The side-slip can be stopped more or less
quickly at any stage by the runner strongly
edging the ski and at the same time again
equalising the distribution of his weight on it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>Whether the ski then runs on in the direction
in which it is pointing, or comes to a standstill,
of course depends on whether it is pointing
downhill or not.</p>

<p>It is obvious, then, that when a ski is in
motion <em>across</em> a slope the runner, by means of
the side-slip, can make it turn in either direction
and to any extent up to a certain limit, and can
in this way either come to a standstill, slightly
alter his direction, or run straight downhill. It
is equally obvious that no matter what means
are employed for starting a turn (there are more
ways of doing so than I have yet described),
the distribution of the runner&#8217;s weight on the
ski or skis which carry it may make all the
difference to the success or failure of the
man&oelig;uvre.</p>

<p>I have already said that when a ski is running
straight downhill it may be made to turn by
the runner jerking it somewhat broadside on.
He can of course do the same with the two skis,
but a simpler plan is for him to stand on one,
point the other more or less in the direction in
which he wants to go, and hold it so for a
moment. It is thus of course made to &#8220;stem&#8221;&mdash;in
other words, to side-slip&mdash;and, if the runner
then throws his weight on to its heel, it can,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
as we have just seen, be made to turn still further,
the previously weighted one being again brought
parallel with it as it does so. A turn can also
be started from a traverse in the same way.</p>

<p>When one ski is held at an angle with the
other in order to start a turn in the above way,
the relative position of the two usually produces
some steering effect; the two skis in fact act
together something like a boat and rudder. To
say that one ski may be looked upon as the boat
and the other as the rudder is hardly accurate,
for the steering effect is at its greatest when,
as the runner&#8217;s weight is shifted from the ski
that is running straight ahead to the one that
is held sideways, it rests equally on both; at
which moment, since their area is equal, either
of the skis may equally well be looked upon as
the rudder or as the boat. If, however, it is
remembered that the boat steers the rudder no
less than the rudder steers the boat, and that
if the rudder is fixed in a certain position, it
and the boat together may be considered as
one solid object whose shape determines whether
and how it is able to turn, one may, by comparing
the skis with a boat and rudder, understand
whether and how, when held in various relative
positions, <em>they</em> are able to turn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>The diagram shows the skis as they are held
at the beginning of&mdash;<span class="smcap">a</span>, a Telemark, <span class="smcap">b</span>, a Stemming
turn, and <span class="smcap">c</span>, a Christiania. It also shows
a boat turning to the left steered by both a bow
and a stern rudder.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a id="fig25"></a><img src="images/fig25.jpg" width="400" height="254" alt="Figure 25" title="Figure 25" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 25.</span></p>
<p class="caption2">The darkened ski of each pair is the weighted one.</p>
</div>

<p>The steering action of the skis may be best
understood by considering the blackened parts
of each pair (in which the steering effect is
neutral) as the sides of a boat, and the light
point and heel of each pair as a bow and
stern rudder respectively. It will then be seen
that the boat is in each case helped to turn to
the left by the action of both rudders, or that
if it can in some way be made to turn to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
left without the help of the rudders, they will
at least not hinder it&mdash;than which, as a matter
of fact, little more can be said in the case of
the Telemark; though in the Stemming turn
there is a strong steering action while the skis
remain in this position, and a distinct, if weak,
one in the Christiania.</p>

<p>The principal factors, then, in the control and
steering of the skis are the edging or flattening
of them, the distribution of the weight on them,
and the placing of them in certain positions
in relation to each other. How these various
factors interact during the different swings,
turns, &amp;c., will be explained more fully in subsequent
chapters, but before closing this one
I want to give some explanation of how a
turn on skis depends as to its character on
whether the ski at the moment of beginning
the turn is running straight down the hill or
across it, on whether the speed is high or low,
and the slope steep or gentle, and also on the
quality of the snow.</p>

<p>The accompanying diagram shows the successive
positions assumed by a ski (the leading
one, the other is not shown) during a turn to
the right, under various conditions.</p>

<p>The line passing through the middle of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
skis shows the curve on which the runner himself
travels during the turn; the line ending in a
double arrow shows the sort of curve on which
he would travel if the ski were able to cut
round without side-slip as a skate does. It will
be seen that if there were no side-slip he would
in every case move steadily to the right of
the line of his original course (shown by a
dotted line in the diagram), but that, on account
of the side-slip, the line on which he travels
sometimes moves only slightly to the right of
that line, even when the turn itself is a
sharp one, that sometimes it moves to the
left of it and then recrosses it, and that sometimes
it remains entirely on the left of it
throughout the turn. To understand how,
according to the conditions, the curve of the
runners actual course varies, is a great help
to the balance, for at first one&#8217;s instinct is to
balance the body as if the ski were cutting
round like a skate, <em>i.e.</em> to lean inwards too
much, which, of course, inevitably results in
a fall.</p>

<p>In every case the turn is supposed to be made
as sharply as the conditions allow. It will be
seen that on hard snow the runner, when travelling
fast, will skid almost directly sideways for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
some distance from the spot where he actually
finishes turning.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a id="fig26"></a><img src="images/fig26.jpg" width="600" height="357" alt="Figure 26" title="Figure 26" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 26.</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">a</span>, <span class="smcap">b</span>, <span class="smcap">c</span>, <span class="smcap">d</span> are turns made while the runner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
is travelling straight downhill, or, which amounts
to the same thing, while he is running on the
level at the end of a downhill slide. <span class="smcap">e</span>, <span class="smcap">f</span>, <span class="smcap">g</span>, <span class="smcap">h</span>
are turns made while the runner is descending
a slope <em>obliquely</em>. <span class="smcap">a</span> to <span class="smcap">f</span> are what are known
as uphill turns, which bring the runner to a
standstill; <span class="smcap">g</span> and <span class="smcap">h</span> are downhill ones, which
enable him to join one tack to another when
descending a hill in zigzags.</p>

<p>If anyone who has done no ski-ing at all reads
this chapter, he will, no doubt, think it very
complicated; but if, while actually learning to
ski, and especially while learning the turns, he
looks through it from time to time, I think
he will soon understand whatever is not quite
clear, and will, I hope, find that it helps him
to correct his mistakes and to understand and
remember his instructions.</p>

<h3><a name="STRAIGHT-RUNNING" id="STRAIGHT-RUNNING"></a>STRAIGHT-RUNNING</h3>


<p><em>Cleaning Skis.</em>&mdash;Before attempting to start,
you must make sure that your skis will slide.</p>

<p>In thawy weather, or very strong sunshine, the
snow may stick to their under surfaces&mdash;so badly,
sometimes, that sliding is out of the question.
But it is seldom quite impossible to slide, and
under conditions which seem hopeless to a beginner
one can generally get started, if one knows
how to set about it. When once under weigh
the great thing is to keep moving, for the
moment the skis stop sliding the snow will stick
again, and the whole cleaning process described
below must be repeated.</p>

<p>In snow which is only slightly sticky you
need merely stamp your skis hard once or
twice, and rub them firmly backwards and forwards
on the hardened snow until you can feel
that they are quite slippery. Then slide off
at once.</p>

<p>If the snow sticks badly, the skis must be
scraped on each other (unless there are any
branches or hard objects lying about which will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
do as well). To do this on level ground is easy;
on the side of a hill rather less so.</p>

<p>Suppose you are obliged to start your run on
the hillside and wish to scrape your skis.</p>

<p>First stand with your skis pointing across the
slope, and, by vigorously stamping or jumping,
make as hard a place to stand in as possible.</p>

<p>If you are standing with your right side to the
hill, and want to scrape the right ski, rest your
left ski on its right (inside) edge, lift round the
right ski, and put it across the other one, at right
angles to it, just <em>behind</em> the left foot and pointing
directly uphill. Then scrape it hard up and
down across the raised outer edge of the left ski,
bending the left knee well and crouching down
so as to get a long scrape from the heel <em>right up
to the bend</em> of the right ski (<a href="#plate11">Plate XI.</a>). When
the ski feels perfectly smooth, lift it round again
parallel to the other ski, and <em>without resting it
on the snow for an instant</em> stamp and rub it
backwards and forwards until it is as slippery
as possible and the snow beneath it as hard and
smooth as you can make it. Then, and not until
then, you can rest the ski on the snow, placing it
on its right (outer) edge and doing your best to
prevent its sole from touching the snow. Now,
with your weight on the right ski, but still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
holding it well on its edge, face downhill, lift
round the left ski, put it across the heel of the
other one, pointing downhill, and, crouching well
down as before, scrape it clean on the inside
edge of the other (<a href="#plate12">Plate XII.</a>); this time it is
the <em>heel</em> of the ski which it is difficult to get
at. Then bring it round to the side of the right
ski, repeat the stamping and rubbing process,
and place it carefully on its inside edge. Now
start instantly. (How to do so is explained
later.)</p>

<p>If the snow is very bad indeed, it is best,
when on tour, before beginning the descent,
to take off the skis, scrape and wipe them
absolutely clean, and dry them thoroughly in
the sun or air&mdash;but not, if you can help it, by
standing them upright in the snow, for if they
are wet the water will run down and form ice at
the heel ends. Then wax and polish them well,
let their soles cool in the shade if they are warm
from the sun, and put them on. You will
probably be able to slide off without trouble; or,
if it is still necessary to scrape and rub them,
they will become clean more easily.</p>

<p>This scraping sounds an elaborate and wearisome
process, and so it is. Fortunately it is
not often necessary; but, when the snow is really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
bad, it is an enormous saving of time and trouble
in the end to attend minutely to every detail,
and may be the only means of getting a run
at all.</p>

<p>It is not unusual to see a beginner refuse to
get his skis thoroughly clean, under the impression
that the slower pace will make things easier
for him. He could not make a greater mistake.
If he leaves any snow sticking to his skis they
will certainly move slowly (unless they refuse to
slide altogether), but they will do so with an
irregular, jerky motion which is ten times more
upsetting than the fastest movement of polished
skis.</p>

<p><em>Starting.</em>&mdash;To start from the top of a hill is
a simple matter. You walk to the edge and
slide over in any direction you choose.</p>

<p>On the side of a slope, however, there is a
difficulty in starting a run straight downhill
owing to the fact that, as you move the skis
round, they begin to slide before you are facing
the way you wish to go.</p>

<p>One way to overcome this difficulty is as
follows: Suppose you are standing at right
angles to the fall of the slope, with the hill on
your right, and wish to start to run straight
downhill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>First move both skis round a little way, so
that, like the left ski in <a href="#plate13">Plate XIII.</a>, they point
downhill as directly as possible without actually
slipping. Then, putting all the weight on the
left ski, lift the right ski and place it on the
snow, pointing straight downhill, its tip being
just in front of and below the tip of the other
one, as in the photograph. The weight should
still be on the left ski. If there is any sign of
slipping, you can stop it by turning the skis
on to their inside edges and pressing outwards
against them with the legs.</p>

<p>You are now quite steady and ready to start.
In order to do so you merely have to throw <em>all</em>
your weight on to the <em>right</em> foot and to lean well
forward, downhill. The right ski will at once
slide off, the right foot will strike and push
forward the point of the left ski, which will,
if left to itself, come round, and fall into what,
as will appear later, is its proper position close
to the side of the other.</p>

<p>Another simple and frequently used method
of starting downhill from the horizontal position
is to jump round. The same points are to be
noticed as when using a jump in the place of a
kick-turn. Bring the feet level, spring from the
ball of the foot, press the <em>knees</em> as well as the feet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
together, hold the skis parallel, and don&#8217;t let their
heels drop. You must land leaning well forward,
so that the general direction of the body and
legs is at right angles to the slope, <em>not</em> vertical,
otherwise the skis will run from under you.</p>

<p>This jump round is easier than the first one
described, being only a quarter-turn, while the
other is a half-turn.</p>

<p><em>Straight-running.</em>&mdash;As you begin to slide, place
yourself in the position of Plates <a href="#plate14">XIV.</a> and <a href="#plate15">XV.</a>,
which is the normal one for running downhill&mdash;skis
held in contact, so that they leave a single
track; one ski about a foot in advance of
the other; the advanced leg almost straight
at the knee, the other more bent; nearly all
the weight on the back foot; the inside of the
front knee pressed against the <em>kneecap</em> of the
other; body erect; arms hanging easily by
the sides; stick, or sticks, if carried, held clear
of the snow.</p>

<p>Hold yourself perfectly easily and without
stiffness, especially at the knees, which should
give to the inequalities of the ground. It is
far better to stand too loosely, and sway about
somewhat, than to keep every muscle tense.</p>

<p>You can keep the skis together without effort
by bending the knees and ankles well inwards,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
so as to place the skis slightly on their inside
edges; they will then tend to run together
rather than to separate. Take the greatest care
to avoid any approach to a bow-legged position,
which would edge the skis outwards. There
should be no daylight visible between your knees
to a person standing in front of you.</p>

<p>If you should find the skis running wide apart
with the weight equally on both, don&#8217;t try to
force them together, but throw all your weight
on to one ski, and then you will be able to
move back the other quite easily to its proper
position.</p>

<p>Carry the stick, or sticks, as shown in the
photographs (Plates <a href="#plate14">XIV.</a> and <a href="#plate15">XV.</a>). On no
account hold a single stick (or the two sticks
placed together) in both hands. If you feel the
smallest tendency to do so, practise at first with
nothing in your hands.</p>

<p>This will save you from acquiring the habit
of falling into the deplorable attitude shown in
<a href="#plate16">Plate XVI.</a>, or the almost equally bad one in
which the stick is held out in front transversely
like a balancing pole, ready for the teeth of
its owner if he happens to pitch forwards.</p>

<p>If their weight or length makes it difficult to
keep the sticks clear of the snow when held by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
the ends, hold them rather nearer the middle, but
not <em>much</em> nearer or they will be more likely to
hurt you if you fall.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t hold out the arms horizontally from the
shoulders, for that is tiring and ungraceful.</p>

<p>The knees, as I said, should give to small
inequalities of the ground; but as you are almost
sure instinctively to stiffen them a little when
you find yourself approaching a bump or hollow
which looks likely to upset your balance, it is
as well to bend or straighten them <em>voluntarily</em>
according to circumstances. As you go over a
mound, for instance, bend the knees and let
the body sink; if it is necessary to sink low,
raise the heel of the back foot and let more
weight fall on the advanced one. As you cross
a hollow, straighten the knees and rise as high
as you can. In this way the pressure of the
skis on the snow will vary but little and the
unevenness of the ground will scarcely be felt.
The feeling will be that of moving steadily
and smoothly along, lifting the skis over the
hillocks, and pressing them down into the
hollows. A spectator who can only see your
head and body should hardly know that the
ground over which you are moving is not perfectly
smooth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>In this way you can negotiate short variations
of gradient where the general angle of the
slope remains constant. In the case of larger
inequalities, or where the general angle of the
slope changes, you must alter your procedure.
The line from your centre of gravity to its
point of support must always be at right angles
to the surface of the slope, so, where the ground
becomes steeper, you will have to lean more
forward, and less so where it becomes less steep.
But though you will have to tilt yourself forward
consciously as you pass on to a steeper
slope, you may safely leave to unconscious instinct
the backward lean in the opposite case.
If you try to lean backward consciously, you
are almost certain to overdo it and to sit
down.</p>

<p>There is a further safeguard in the case of
sudden changes of gradient, very rough ground,
snow of varying consistency which alternately
checks and accelerates the speed, and, in fact,
anything which makes it difficult to keep the
balance-that is, to drop into what is generally
known as the &#8220;Telemark&#8221; position (Plates <a href="#plate17">XVII.</a>,
<a href="#plate18">XVIII.</a>, <a href="#plate19">XIX.</a>), because it is the one held during
the swing of that name.</p>

<p>To assume this attitude, you shift the weight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
from the back foot to the advanced one, and
then sink down, leaning the body forwards,
bending both knees, and sliding the back ski
still farther back until its bend is level with
the leading ankle.</p>

<p>Practically all your weight should then be
upon the leading foot, and upon its heel, no
less than its toes. To make sure of this, the
advanced leg must be bent at the knee almost
to a right angle, and the knee must be kept
well forward, so that the leg, from the knee
downwards, will be at right angles to the ski,
no matter how steep may be the slope.</p>

<p>If the front foot is thrust forward in advance
of the knee, too much weight will fall on the
<em>toe</em> (unlikely as it may appear) and, moreover,
some weight will be thrown on the back foot,
which should carry next to none. Let the
back knee drop until quite close to the ski
(when crossing uneven ground it will very likely
touch it) and raise the heel of the back foot
as far as possible. That leg should then be
perfectly relaxed and easy. Keep the skis close
together as before, so that they leave a single
track, by edging them a trifle inwards and pressing
both <em>knees</em>, especially the back one, well inwards
so that, seen from in front or behind, they overlap.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>Practise running in this position with either
foot leading, taking care to keep the weight
well on the front foot. It is an indispensable
accomplishment; and although at first it may
not seem so easy a position as the normal one,
it is such a help to the balance that later on
you must be on your guard or you may contract
the bad habit of running constantly in this
position when there is no real need for it.</p>

<p>In this position not only is the centre of
gravity lowered, but the base of support is considerably
lengthened, and the fore and aft
stability is thus enormously increased. By
means of it you will be able to move with
perfect steadiness over ground which would
almost inevitably upset you if you were to
stand up in the normal position.</p>

<p>In this, just as in the normal position, you
can consciously raise and lower yourself to allow
for uneven ground, by bending or straightening
the advanced leg; but this will seldom be
necessary, except for very abrupt inequalities.</p>

<p>Even sudden changes of speed have little
power to disturb your balance when you are
running in this attitude. If the gradient
suddenly becomes much steeper, as in Plates
<a href="#plate18">XVIII.</a> and <a href="#plate19">XIX.</a>, you should give a determined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
plunge forwards, as though trying to get ahead
of your skis. If, however, you are taken by
surprise, and run suddenly on to an invisible
icy patch or over a steep drop in bad light,
you will probably at the worst only find your
weight thrown on to the back foot, and will be
able to recover yourself. On the other hand,
if the speed is checked and you are thrown
forwards, the back foot will tend to rise into
the air, and, receiving the weight of the ski,
will most likely just save you. If the check is
so abrupt as to throw you right off your
balance forwards, you can often save yourself
by bringing, with a quick stride, the disengaged
back foot to the front to receive your
weight. Indeed you are almost sure to do so
instinctively.</p>

<p>Another position, which is employed by some
runners under circumstances such as I have
just described, is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The runner crouches as low as possible, almost
sitting on the raised heel of the back foot; the
front leg, from the knee downwards, is perpendicular
to the ski, but its foot is not much
farther ahead than in the normal running
position; the back knee is pressed against the
inside of the front leg, just above the ankle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>This attitude is less tiring to hold than the
Telemark position, but is, I think, less of a safeguard
to the balance when the speed changes
suddenly or the ground is very rough.</p>

<p>All that I have just said has reference only
to the preservation of the balance in a fore and
aft direction. The question of lateral stability
is far simpler; on all ordinary occasions it is
sufficiently secured by keeping the skis as close
together, and so making as narrow a track as
possible.</p>

<p>The reason for this is not quite self-evident,
but is easily explained.</p>

<p>If a bicycle be ridden on bumpy ground, it
will not be tilted sideways as it crosses the
side of an undulation, and will have no tendency
to upset unless it actually side-slips.</p>

<p>A tricycle, on the other hand, or any vehicle
with a wide wheel-base, will under similar circumstances
be more or less tilted according to
the angle of the ground, and will, unless it
has a <em>very</em> wide wheel-base and a low centre
of gravity, be easily upset by a sudden transverse
variation in the angle of the ground,
especially when moving fast.</p>

<p>The diagram shows how a ski-runner when
holding his skis apart may be compared with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
a tricycle, when holding them together with
a bicycle.</p>

<p>This is not quite a fair simile, for, while the
cases of the bicycle and of the ski-runner in
the single-track position
are exactly analogous, a
man with his skis apart
is not a rigid construction
like a tricycle, but,
by letting his knees give
and by swaying his body,
can adapt himself to the
change of gradient.</p>

<p>Still, the tendency is
always, especially in the
case of the beginner,
for the legs to stiffen
when they ought to
yield, and on this account
alone the single-track
position is the safer.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<a id="fig27"></a><img src="images/fig27.jpg" width="206" height="400" alt="Figure 27" title="Figure 27" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 27.</span></p>
</div>

<p>There are, moreover, two further objections&mdash;and
very strong ones&mdash;to separating the skis.</p>

<p>One is that it is impossible to run with the
skis apart without holding the feet about level,
instead of keeping one well ahead of the other.
With the feet level the runner has far less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
stability in a fore and aft direction, and, without
support from his stick, can hardly hope to keep
his balance in the event of a very sudden change
of speed. The other objection is that when the
skis are separated each one has to be kept
straight independently. At a low speed it is
perhaps not very difficult to do this, but at
a high speed it is by no means easy, and,
of course, any divergence or convergence of the
skis is almost certain to cause a fall before it
can be checked.</p>

<p>When held against each other, however, the
skis, if properly made, will run perfectly straight
and need no attention at all. Obviously they
cannot converge, and the least inward pressure
or edging will prevent them from running apart.</p>

<p>The single-track position, then, has many
advantages. The only thing against it is its
unsteadiness in the event of side-slip. But
under ordinary conditions of snow, a ski, when
moving straight ahead, either directly down the
slope or obliquely across it, will show no tendency
to side-slip, not even when, in the latter
case, the slope is very steep (provided, of course,
the ski be held normally, <em>i.e.</em> edged). Under
such conditions you can always run with the
skis held close together in either the normal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>or the Telemark position, and there can be no
excuse for deliberately separating them.</p>

<p>When running on a hard icy crust, however,
it is sometimes impossible to prevent the skis
from side-slipping. They are, of course, much
more apt to side-slip when moving across a slope
(especially a steep one) than when running
straight down it; indeed when traversing a <em>steep</em>
slope they may side-slip even in <em>soft</em> snow if that
is shallow and rests on a slippery crust. But
though they will generally run straight downhill
with absolute steadiness on snow that makes
them side-slip badly when traversing, the surface
may be so extremely slippery that they will
side-slip even in a direct descent owing to small
<em>lateral</em> undulations of the ground.</p>

<p>As soon, in either case, as the tendency to
side-slip becomes so pronounced that you are
really hopelessly unsteady in the single-track
position, you will, if you still want to run at
full speed, have to separate the feet more or
less and hold them about level. Do not separate
the feet more than just enough to steady you,
and do not do it at all until you are quite sure
it is absolutely necessary; try merely to separate
them a little for a moment when the side-slip
unsteadies you and to recover the normal <em>position</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
instantly; some runners seem able to hold the
single-track position at any speed on the most
slippery snow&mdash;possibly by making imperceptible
jumps to one side or another as they feel the slip
begin.</p>

<p>When running with your feet level and apart,
your fore and aft balance will, of course, be more
precarious than in the normal position; you had
better, therefore, lower your centre of gravity
by crouching as low as you can with steadiness,
<em>i.e.</em> not so low that all your weight comes on
the heels or that they have to be raised at all.
In the level-footed position your best safeguard
in case of sudden changes of gradient or snow
consistency is <em>not</em> to lean backwards or forwards,
but <em>to move the feet forwards or backwards</em>, which
amounts to exactly the same thing but is a much
quicker process.</p>

<p>This may not be quite clear. Let me try to
explain. As I have already said, the line from
your centre of gravity to your point of support
must always be about at right angles to the
slope. Suppose then that you are running fast
down a slope with an abrupt mound in front of
you, instead of trying to readjust your balance
as you pass on to the mound by leaning suddenly
<em>backwards</em>, do so by still more suddenly doubling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
<em>forwards</em> a bit at the hips and, so to speak, <em>lifting
your feet forwards and placing them</em> <span class="smcap">against</span> <em>the
mound to receive your weight</em>. If, on the other
hand, you suddenly run off a gentle slope on to
a steep one, quickly hollow your back a little,
and, by straightening yourself at the hips and
bending your knees more, lift your feet <em>backwards</em>
and place them against the slope behind you.
By &#8220;lifting&#8221; the skis I do not mean actually
<em>raising</em> them from the snow, but only taking
the weight off them a trifle, and <em>sliding</em> them.
These movements are exactly the same as those
you would make if, when standing with your
feet tied together, you were pushed off your
balance either forwards or backwards and were
then to save yourself by a little jump in the
corresponding direction. <em>Leaning</em> backwards and
forwards, which as it is done principally on the
hinge of the ankles cannot be done quickly, may
be used as a <em>preventive</em> of loss of balance, but is
practically useless as a <em>cure</em>; this moving of the
<em>feet</em>, however, is particularly useful for the latter
purpose. If you try the two methods when
running quickly down a very undulating icy
path, you will soon decide in favour of the latter.</p>

<p>You can, of course, do the same thing when
running in steady snow with the skis together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
in the normal position, but it is then simpler and
quicker to move <em>one</em> foot backwards or forwards
instead of moving both.</p>

<p>Although, as I have said, side-slip occurs more
readily when you are traversing a slope, you will
then find it far less upsetting than when you are
running straight downhill. When traversing in
normal position with the skis together, the upper
foot should lead and the weight be on the lower;
with the lower foot weighted it will take a
very sudden and pronounced side-slip to upset
you, for as the lower ski slips the upper will
receive the weight, and the sudden pressure will
probably make its edge hold long enough for
you to recover your balance. Moreover, you
will generally, when traversing, be running pretty
slowly (you can, of course, go as slowly as you
like by making the angle of your traverse a very
gradual one), which makes side-slip still less likely
to upset you. It is, therefore, hardly ever necessary
to traverse with your skis more than a few
inches apart.</p>

<p>If you wish to run a traverse at high speed
where the tendency to side-slip is very pronounced,
do not make violent efforts to prevent
it by edging your skis extra hard, but simply
keep them normally edged with your ankles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
and especially your knees, well over towards the
hill, and then <em>let</em> them side-slip if they want to.
Make no attempt to lean towards the slope, but
keep your weight well outwards and forwards,
imagine that you are making for a spot rather
<em>below</em> where your skis are pointing, and run as
<em>lightly</em> as possible, cultivating, if you can, a sort
of semi-sideways <em>floating</em> feeling, which is hardly
describable but which you will certainly recognise
if you do as I have told you.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, the harder and slipperier
the snow the more lightly you should try to run,
the softer the snow the more heavily you should
try to drive your skis into it.</p>

<p>You can entirely disregard the hard ruts of
ski tracks unless you are obliged to cross them
at a narrow angle. If you cannot help doing
this (which you should try to if running fast)
be ready, if one of the skis or both get turned
off their course, to lift one quickly and put it
straight again before you lose your balance.
You should never be afraid of lifting your skis,
especially on hard snow; by stepping about
quickly you can not only keep your balance even
when running fast, but can alter your course,
though in the latter case you must be careful
<em>as</em> you put the first-lifted ski to the snow again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
to lift the other <em>instantly</em>, or they will run apart
for a moment and probably upset you. The
greater your speed, the less of course will be
the change of direction that you can make safely
in one step, but by pattering round quickly you
can turn fairly short when going at a good rate.</p>

<p>When running <em>straight downhill</em> in either
normal or Telemark position either foot may
lead, and you should change about, when practising,
until you find you can lead as easily with
one as with the other. When <em>traversing</em> in
<em>normal</em> position the upper foot should lead, in
<em>Telemark</em> position, the lower foot&mdash;that is to
say, that in traversing the <em>weighted</em> foot should
<em>always</em> be the <em>lower</em> one.</p>

<p>The more weight is carried by the lower ski,
the less difficulty will you find in keeping the
other one close to the side of it.</p>

<p>Should the upper ski show a tendency to run
uphill, away from the other, put no more weight
on it, but merely turn its inner edge slightly
downwards, and press on the toe, when it will
run back to its proper position.</p>

<p>If you have any difficulty in preventing it
from running downwards, and crossing the
other, you can slide it to the rear, and drop
into Telemark position, lower foot leading.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>Although, generally speaking, you should avoid
all effort and hold yourself easily and loosely,
you must, when your balance is disturbed, make
every effort in your power to keep it.</p>

<p>One very often falls simply through expecting
to fall, and doing nothing to save oneself, when
a determination not to fall would carry one
through.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t be afraid of running straight down the
steepest slope, <em>provided the ground is open and
fairly smooth, the snow easy and safe</em>,<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> <em>and the
change of gradient at the bottom not sudden</em>.
Remember that the pace does not go on increasing,
but attains its maximum in a second
or two. It is only while you are gathering way
that the sensation is at all alarming; when full
speed is reached&mdash;provided the ground be smooth&mdash;a
steep slope feels no more difficult than a
gradual one. If, however, there are any undulations&mdash;however
small&mdash;you had better run
down a steep slope in the Telemark position.
For though on a moderate slope you might
hardly notice them, or could allow for them as
directed above, on a steep slope the high speed
will very much increase their effect, and to run<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
over a small mound may shoot you into the air
if your legs happen to be rigid at the moment.</p>

<p>Whenever you are actually running freely and
not trying to put on the brake, or stop (explained
later), the very best safeguard to the balance is
a desire to go faster.</p>

<p>Should you not happen to want to go faster,
pretend you do, if you are not above such
childishness.</p>

<p>No amount of wanting, of course, will affect
your speed, but this mental attitude will enormously
increase your steadiness by removing the
fatal tendency to lean backwards.</p>

<p>Similarly, to wish to go slower will not make
you do so, but will very likely be the sole cause
of a fall.</p>

<p>Some such sentence as &#8220;This is very slow,&#8221;
repeated to oneself as one goes over any difficult
ground, is a more potent spell than might be
imagined.</p>

<h3><a name="BRAKING" id="BRAKING"></a>BRAKING</h3>


<p>If you wish to reduce your speed or stop, you
can, as a rule, if you are not going fast&mdash;and
sometimes even if you are&mdash;do so without altering
your course, by making one or both skis move
more or less broadside on. Although I am only
now about to describe the different ways in which
this may be done, you should begin to learn
them at the very outset&mdash;or even <em>before</em> you try
straight-running, if you are very nervous&mdash;and
should certainly not attempt to run very fast
until you can brake perfectly by every method
described in this chapter, and are fairly proficient
in the turns to be described later on.</p>

<p><em>Single-Stemming or Half-Snow-Plough.</em>&mdash;For
this find a moderate slope on which the snow is
neither very soft nor so hard that you cannot
possibly traverse it without side-slipping&mdash;an
ordinary practice-ground in its normal state is
just the thing.</p>

<p>Stand with your skis horizontally across the
slope; weight the lower one; lift the upper, and
place it pointing steeply enough downhill to slide
perfectly freely, with its tip quite close to the
other&#8217;s, but far enough behind it for the upper
foot to be exactly above the lower one (<a href="#fig28">Fig. 28</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p class="caption" style="margin-top: 0em;"><span class="smcap">Fig. 28.</span>&mdash;Single-stemming or half-snow-plough.</p>
</div>

<p>Now lean towards the upper leg, and bend it
until your weight is on it, facing towards the
point of the upper ski and edging it. Then,
keeping the lower leg in exactly the same
position, bend its ankle outwards, and almost,
<em>but not quite</em> (see <a href="#Page_83">p. 83</a>), flatten the ski. The
flattening of the ski will release you, and you
will slide off in the direction of the upper ski&#8217;s
point, pushing the lower ski, which must still
remain horizontal, forwards and sideways through
the snow&mdash;<em>stemming</em> with it in fact. You can go
as slowly as you like, or as fast as the conditions
permit, according as you keep the stemming ski
more edged and weighted or less. You can stop
suddenly by throwing your whole weight on to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
the stemming ski, facing round towards its point,
and quickly bringing the upper ski beside it and
forward to the normal position.</p>

<p>Now make a kick turn (a downhill one for
choice), and repeat the process in the other
direction, stemming with the other foot.</p>

<p>Practise this in both directions until you have
complete control of your speed, and can stop
yourself almost instantly when moving at a fair
rate, remembering always to face round and
bring the upper ski smartly into the normal position
as you stop. Then practise it with the upper
ski pointing more and more steeply downhill.</p>

<p>It is, of course, possible to start stemming in
this way when running freely across the slope
with the skis together, and when accustomed to
doing it from a standstill you should also practise
this, but only when running at a moderate pace,
as there are steadier and easier ways of stopping
when running fast.</p>

<p>You must, as I have said, hold the lower foot
exactly below the upper one, because in that
position you can push along the stemming ski
with least effort, and most quickly throw the
weight on it if the other ski side-slips or you
want to stop suddenly. This means that the
more directly downhill you go the farther forward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
you will have to hold the lower foot, and the
more, consequently, you will have to bend the
upper leg (in order still to keep the weight on
the upper ski), eventually having to lift its heel
and finally to <em>sit</em> on it, if you are to stem almost
or quite directly downhill, as
it is quite possible to do.</p>

<p>If you find you can do all
this fairly comfortably, by all
means do so; if, however, you
find that at a certain angle
your position on the upper leg
becomes very tiring or unsteady,
leave this man&oelig;uvre
and try stemming with <em>both</em>
skis, which is also called</p>

<p><em>Snow-ploughing.</em>&mdash;Start
straight downhill, where the
slope is quite gentle, in the
normal running position. The moment you are
moving bring your feet level, put the weight
on both, raise the outer edges of the skis by
bending your knees inwards a little, and, <em>without
letting the ski-tips separate, push their heels
as wide apart as you possibly can</em>. The legs
must now be <em>absolutely</em> straight at the knees.</p>

<div class="figright">
<a id="fig29"></a><img src="images/fig29.jpg" width="200" height="400" alt="Figure 29" title="Figure 29" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 29.</span>&mdash;Double-stemming
or snow-plough.</p>
<p class="caption2">The blackened parts are those which should be weighted.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>If you keep your knees straight and ankles
relaxed the skis will travel nearly flat&mdash;they
should <em>never</em>, as I have said, be <em>quite</em> flat or
their outer edges will catch and trip you&mdash;and
there will be but little braking effect. If you
bend your knees inwards a little, and edge your
skis strongly, you will, if the slope is moderate,
reduce your pace gradually and stop. On very
icy snow, unless the slope is very gentle, you
cannot stop by snow-ploughing, however hard
you edge, but can only reduce your speed more
or less. The [V] position is then, however, a very
useful alternative to the position with the skis
slightly apart and parallel as a safeguard to
the balance in case of side-slip. It of course
gives the utmost lateral stability (if the straddle
is very wide, as it always should be), and the
straight knees prevent it from being in the least
tiring, while, when the skis are flattened, the
reduction of speed is hardly worth considering.
It is therefore usually preferable to the other
position, with its tiring crouch, unless the slope
is steep (and the speed therefore very high)
or the ground rough, when it becomes unsafe
on account, not only of its rigidity, but of its
greater fore and aft instability, for with the
legs in this position one cannot move the feet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
quickly backwards and forwards in the way
described on <a href="#Page_113">p. 113</a>. On ground neither steep
nor rough enough to make it unsteady, one
can, if the snow is hard, safely take the snow-plough
position quite suddenly when running
at full speed. This is very convenient if when
running in normal position one suddenly runs
on to an icy patch.</p>

<p>On hard snow, then, snow-ploughing is only
effective for braking purposes under certain conditions.
In soft snow, if that is at all deep, it is
almost useless&mdash;except for those who can make
an abnormally wide straddle&mdash;for if in soft snow
the skis are put in the [V] position, the inward pressure
of the snow against them is so great that
unless the legs can resist it almost <em>directly</em> they
are forced together at once, or, at the best, have
to let the skis run almost parallel, in which case
there is not much object in holding them apart
at all. If, however, you are one of the fortunate
few who can straddle more than three quarters of
their height and point their feet almost directly
inwards, you will find that snow-ploughing gives
you perfect control, even in soft snow, on all but
the steepest slopes, and that even there you may
be able to manage by throwing most of the
weight on one ski and making it slide nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
broadside on while the other points almost
straight downhill, the line of your <em>course</em>
being still directly down the slope, and the legs
still straddled as widely as possible, and straight
at the knees. You will, however, only be able
to do this by paying particular attention to the
edging of the weighted ski, for if it is edged
either too much or too little it will not slide at
all when you try to move along slowly, and will
check you suddenly and throw you down when
you try to stop.</p>

<p>It is important to remember in snow-ploughing
that, whether you want to brake hard
or only slightly, the straddle must <em>always</em> be as
wide as possible; the speed should depend on the
flattening or edging of the skis, not on the angle
between them. Moreover, if when running free
with skis together you want to take the [V] position,
you must always&mdash;even if running fast&mdash;do
so as <em>quickly</em> as possible (not forgetting just
to lift the outer edges of the skis <em>before</em> you push
them out). Remember also that it is no use
putting the feet wide apart unless <em>the tips of the
skis are close together</em> (closer than <a href="#plate20">Plate XX.</a></p>

<p>You can start snow-ploughing from a standstill
on a steep slope either by taking the position<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
of <a href="#plate13">Plate XIII.</a> and pushing the upper ski round
to the proper angle <em>as</em> you throw your weight
on to it, or simply by thrusting both sticks
into the snow below you and leaning on them
while you put the skis in position.</p>

<p>If, for structural reasons, you have only been
able to take an academic interest in the instructions
for snow-ploughing in soft snow, you can
now learn a man&oelig;uvre which will enable you in
soft snow of any depth to stem as gradually or
as steeply as you choose down a slope of any
steepness.</p>

</div>

<p><em>Telemark Stemming.</em>&mdash;Find a steepish slope
which is soft enough to prevent the least tendency
to side-slip. Stand with the skis horizontal.
Weight the lower, and place the upper one at
an angle which will let it slide freely, as you did
in learning ordinary stemming, but this time with
its front bend touching the lower ankle, and its tip
rather across the lower instep. Edge it normally,
<em>kneel down on the front of it</em>, and slide off by
flattening the other (<a href="#fig30">Fig. 30</a>). You are now
stemming in what is practically Telemark position;
the object of actually <em>kneeling on</em> the upper
ski is to save effort, which, of course, it does
completely. It also gives the utmost steadiness.
The centre of gravity being so low, you can in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
this position stop yourself much more suddenly
with safety than you can in either snow-ploughing
or ordinary stemming, and can also more safely
take up the stemming position while running
freely&mdash;if, of course, you then take the ordinary
Telemark position and kneel right down first.
In order to stem straight downhill you must
place the upper ski <em>at right angles</em> to the horizontal
lower ski (you may have to get it in
position with your hand before starting from a
standstill on a steep slope); its point will then be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
right across the front instep. The front leg will
be quite straight and the foot, of course, turned
right inwards&mdash;a position which may sound
awkward, but which most people find surprisingly
easy, especially on a steep slope. If you
want to stop suddenly, straighten&mdash;or rather,
diminish the bend of&mdash;the upper leg, lifting its
knee from the ski and throwing yourself well
forward on to the lower one. And always remember
to face round quickly towards its point
as you do so, and to bring the other ski smartly
to normal position by its side.</p>

<p>Telemark-stemming straight downhill is not
only easy in the softest snow, but also on
everything but the very hardest, no matter
how steep the slope.</p>

<p>This man&oelig;uvre, in fact, is an extremely useful
one (though neither I nor, I believe, any other
writer on ski-ing had the sense to realise its
value until Herr Bilgeri pointed it out), and
you should lose no time in mastering it&mdash;not
that it takes much mastering, for the average
beginner can do it with ease at the first
attempt. It is no use, however, for <em>traversing</em>,
either steeply or gradually, on <em>hard</em> snow,
for the upper ski is then very apt to side-slip
and upset the runner. Nor on <em>very</em> hard and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
slippery snow is it suitable even for a direct
descent, as it is then difficult to hold enough
weight on the stemming ski to keep the pace
down. On this sort of snow, however, as long
as it gives any grip at all&mdash;and, when it does
not, it is no longer snow, but <em>ice</em>, for which skis
are not intended&mdash;you can descend the steepest
slopes either directly or obliquely with your speed
under perfect control by</p>

<p><em>Side-Slipping.</em>&mdash;In order to side-slip straight
downhill you simply stand with your skis horizontal
and rather apart, and start by flattening
them a little and throwing your weight well
outwards, as if you wanted to go <em>fast</em> down
the hill, not <em>slowly</em>. You will then <em>not</em> go fast,
but <em>will</em> keep your weight over your skis and
be able by edging them again to check your
pace or stop when you want to. If you want
to stop suddenly, give a little jump and stamp
the ski edges hard into the snow. Do not be
too anxious to go slowly, or in the effort to
edge the skis extra hard you will probably
lean towards the slope, push them from under
you, and fall down. The skis must remain
horizontal as they slip; if they begin to turn
upwards or downwards, put weight on the toes
or heels respectively. If by weighting the toes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
you make the skis point downwards a little
they will slide forwards as well as sideways,
and the more they are then edged the more
they will move forwards in comparison with
their sideway motion. By side-slipping, therefore,
you can traverse slowly at any angle you
choose if the slope is fairly steep.</p>

<p>You can also stop yourself by side-slipping if
you wish to when running a free traverse in
normal position. You merely have to make
the skis side-slip and instantly put your weight
on the heels until they turn uphill a little, when
you can again edge and stop them.</p>

<p>A little practice will make the whole man&oelig;uvre
almost instantaneous; it is then really a Christiania
swing (see <a href="#Page_175">p. 175</a>), and, if the snow is not
very soft, is a far quicker and easier way than
ordinary stemming or stopping or checking the
pace for a moment. Throw your weight well
outwards to keep it over your skis as they
side-slip; your tendency at first will be to fall
towards the hill.</p>

<p>If you ever wish to make a stemming traverse
at a <em>steep</em> angle on a <em>moderate</em> slope where the
snow though hard is not quite slippery enough
for you to side-slip down it, you may be somewhat
at a loss. In the Telemark position you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
will find a tendency to side-slip, and you may,
in the ordinary stemming position, with the
lower ski held horizontally and the weight on
the upper one, be unable to manage the necessary
squatting attitude comfortably. You can
then traverse in something between the ordinary
stemming and the snow-plough positions with
the upper ski edged outwards and pointing the
way you are going, but with the weight almost
equally distributed between it and the lower,
which points somewhat downhill instead of
horizontally and is held with its tip level with
the other&#8217;s, not ahead. The upper knee must
be bent, the lower straight.</p>

<p>We have so far talked only of hard and soft
snow, but the snow surface is sometimes a breakable
crust, into which the skis cut, and in which
no sort of stemming is possible. Your only way
of going slowly in this is to traverse at a very
slight angle; if you then want to stop, you must
<em>step round</em>&mdash;that is, you must lift the upper
ski, put it down again pointing horizontally
across the slope, and <em>instantly</em> lift the lower
and bring it down parallel with the first. Be
careful to throw your weight well upwards and
forwards as you put down the upper ski, and
not to let the lower remain on the snow for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
a <em>moment</em> after the first has been brought to
it again; it is safest to give a little jump from
one to the other.</p>

<p>Either by stepping round, or by any sort of
stemming, you can of course make a change of
direction when traversing if the gradient of the
slope varies; as you pass on to steeper ground,
for instance, you can weight the heel of the
stemming ski for a moment until it is again horizontal,
at the same time flattening the running
ski a little and letting it slip down to the angle
at which it was pointing before. This is really
an embryo swing, as you will see later; one
important reason, in fact, for learning all the
methods of braking thoroughly is that they are
the elements of which the swings are composed,
each variety of swing or turn being either a
development of one method of braking, or a
combination of one with another.</p>

<p>When you become more expert you will not
often have to stem while <em>traversing</em> if the ground
is open, though even then you will often find
it convenient to brake in one way or other when
going straight downhill. In thick wood, however,
you will find it indispensable to be able
to go at a moderate speed in all sorts of snow
and at any gradient. It is also worth remembering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
that to stem straight downhill at an
ordinary pace is a comparatively <em>fast</em> process.
It is not so pretty and needs much less skill,
but it is <em>quicker</em> than running freely in tacks
of an ordinary gradient and connecting them
by downhill turns (explained later).</p>

<p>When running down a narrow path or the
like it is sometimes impossible to brake effectually,
as there is not room to put the skis in a wide
[V] position or to Telemark-stem; it may then
be permissible to use the stick or sticks as an
aid. <a href="#plate21">Plate XXI.</a> shows a way of doing this.
The arm supported against the thigh gives a firm
purchase&mdash;firm enough, in my experience, to hurt
the wrist a good deal if the points of the sticks
catch something hard. This man&oelig;uvre is hardly
ever necessary unless the path is very icy; if
there is much of this, and you want to go slowly,
you may just as well walk with your skis on your
shoulder.</p>

<p>When you can do all that has been explained
so far, you may (if you have steadily refrained
from using your stick except as I have directed)
consider yourself quite a respectable ski-runner
in a small way. There will be nothing to prevent
you from going for any expedition of which the
uphill climb is within your powers, for whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
you are going uphill or downhill, there is no sort
of ground that cannot be negotiated by one or
other of the man&oelig;uvres that I have described.</p>

<p>But, though a perfectly efficient tourist, you
will not be a very fast one downhill until you
have learnt how to stop and steer yourself in
any sort of snow, <em>when running fast</em>, and will
tire yourself unnecessarily on steep or difficult
ground until you can run in zigzags without
coming to a standstill between each tack.</p>

<p>The different ways of doing these things are
described in the following sections.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p><h3><a name="THE_STEMMING_TURN" id="THE_STEMMING_TURN"></a>THE STEMMING TURN</h3>


<p>I must here apologise for the extreme ambiguity
of ski-ing terminology, which, however, as I did
not invent it, I have not the moral courage to try
to improve. The term &#8220;stemming&#8221; may be
used in several different senses. In its narrowest
sense it means holding the skis in the [V]
position and braking with <em>one</em> of them. More
broadly it means braking with <em>both</em> in the [V]
position. It also means braking with the skis
in Telemark position. In fact in its broadest
sense it means any sort of braking except side-slipping
with the skis parallel.</p>

<p>In this sense almost any method of turning on
skis might, as we shall see later, be called a
&#8220;stemming&#8221; turn. The expression &#8220;stemming
turn,&#8221; however, is generally used in a special
sense to denote a turn during which the skis
are held in the [V] position with the feet nearly
level.</p>

<p>By means of a &#8220;stemming turn&#8221; you can, as
you already know, turn <em>uphill</em> or stop when
traversing; you can also do so from a direct
descent. You can, moreover, turn <em>downhill</em> from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
a traverse until you face in the opposite direction
and run off on a new tack.</p>

<p>This turn is effected by putting the skis in a
more or less wide [V] position, and either simultaneously
or immediately afterwards <em>weighting</em>
and slightly advancing the one that is to be
outermost in turning. To show how in this as
in all turns the various factors of side-slipping,
with the weight variously distributed, combined
steering action of both skis, edging, &amp;c., come
into play according to circumstances, it will
be necessary to describe in detail the two different
uses of the turn.</p>

<p>For practising these turns find a moderate
slope and snow in which it is easy to stem
when running straight downhill; a much trodden
practice-ground is the very thing.</p>

<p><em>Uphill Turn to the Left.</em>&mdash;You already know
how to turn uphill from a traverse by stemming;
the following way of doing it is slightly simpler.
Traverse to the left at an easy gradient in normal
position, weight on right foot. When you want
to turn, draw the upper ski a little to the rear
(<a href="#fig31">Fig. 31</a>, <em>1</em>) and then push the heels wide
apart, straightening both legs and putting all
the weight on the lower heel (<a href="#fig31">Fig. 31</a>, <em>2</em> and
<em>3</em>). As the lower ski begins to turn uphill, bring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
the other one smartly to its side again in normal
position.</p>

<p>This is much the same thing as stopping
when stemming with the lower ski, as described
above (<a href="#Page_121">page 121</a>), but is rather simpler, for the
uncomfortable crouching position necessary when
stemming with the lower ski is avoided, there
is no shifting of the weight from one ski to the
other, and the preparatory movement of drawing
back the upper ski can perfectly well be
made simultaneously with the actual turn.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 31.</span>&mdash;Uphill stemming turn to left.</p>
<p class="caption2">The blackened parts are those which should be weighted.</p>
</div>

<p>To make an uphill stemming turn when running
across a slope in normal position is rather
a clumsy process, and it is quite unnecessary
to spend much time in practising it, for an
uphill turn from a traverse can be made more
easily and effectively by the Christiania swing,
in the way already explained, or the Telemark,
which will be described later. Just make sure,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
however, that you <em>can</em> turn uphill in this way
from a traverse in either direction, and then
try the turn from a direct descent, as follows.</p>

<p>Run straight downhill in the stemming position
with the weight equally on both skis and the feet
as wide apart as possible, taking care that the
legs are quite straight at
the knee, and rigid (<a href="#fig32">Fig.
32</a>, <em>1</em>).</p>

<div class="figright">
<a id="fig32"></a><img src="images/fig32.jpg" width="212" height="300" alt="Figure 32" title="Figure 32" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 32.</span>&mdash;Uphill stemming turn to left.</p>
<p class="caption2">The blackened parts are those which should be weighted.</p>
</div>

<p>In order to turn to the
left (most people find it
easiest to learn to turn to
this side first) you have
simply to throw all the
weight on to the heel of
the right foot and turn the
body to face the point of
the right ski. You will
begin to turn to the left, and as you do so the
left foot will involuntarily fall slightly to the
rear (<em>2</em>), when the steering action due to the
relative position of the skis will help the turn.</p>

<p>If you keep all the weight on the heel of
the right foot you will go on turning until
the right ski points slightly uphill, when you
will come to a standstill (<em>3</em>). As you do so,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
be sure to bring the inner ski quickly to the
normal position.</p>

<p>This is extremely simple, and, if you keep
both legs quite straight and the feet wide
apart, you can hardly fail to do it correctly.</p>

<p>The mistake you are most likely to make is
that of letting the left knee bend as you begin
to come round. If it does so the left ski
will get on its outside edge, and, instead of
continuing to skid round, will only run in the
direction in which it is pointing, so that if it
does not run across the other (<a href="#plate25">Plate XXV.</a>), and
throw you down,<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> you will find yourself running
obliquely across the slope, stemming with the
right ski only instead of turning uphill and
stopping.</p>

<p>It is not sufficient, however, to keep the
inner leg straight, for unless at the same time
you keep nearly all weight off it, either the
left ski will get in front and you will begin to
face downhill again, or it will get too much on
to its inside edge, and will at least prevent you
from finishing the turn, even if it does not trip
you up.</p>

<p>As soon as you can turn to the left in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
way, learn to turn to the right, of course substituting
&#8220;right&#8221; for &#8220;left&#8221; and &#8220;left&#8221; for
&#8220;right&#8221; in the directions.</p>

<p>If, while running straight downhill, you turn
and come to a standstill in the way I have
described, you will, when you have stopped, find
yourself a certain distance to one side or the
other of your original course.</p>

<p>This may not always be convenient; you may,
for instance, want to stop while running down
an icy road, fenced on each side, and so narrow
that you have only just room enough to stem,
and would run into the fence if you swung to
one side in stopping.</p>

<p>In a case of this sort you can turn suddenly
and stop in your tracks in the following way:&mdash;</p>

<p>Suppose you are running straight downhill
in the double-stemming position; when you want
to stop, give a vigorous push with one foot&mdash;say
the left&mdash;and so throw all your weight <em>suddenly</em>
right outwards on to the heel of the right foot,
turning the body quickly well round to the left
as you do so. If this is done with force and
decision the right ski skids round quickly to a
horizontal position, and as it does so, the left ski
comes into the air, is lifted smartly round, and
brought down parallel with and close to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
other one. You then find yourself at a standstill,
facing to the left across your original track,
but without having moved to one side of it
(<a href="#fig33">Fig. 33</a>).</p>

<p>Just at first you may fail to do this properly
through giving a timid,
jerky push with the left
foot instead of a steady
thrust. This will prevent
your weight from going
sufficiently outwards over
the right ski, and the left
ski will come to the snow
again before you have had
time to lift it round to the
side of the other one and
before that one has had
time to skid round to right
angles with your course. After a very few trials,
however, you should be able to do it correctly,
and you will then find that no great force is necessary,
and that the movement need not even be
made particularly quickly provided it be done
with a free swing. In order to give the push you
must, of course, bend the inside knee slightly.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 33.</span>&mdash;Uphill stemming turn to left.</p>
<p class="caption2">The blackened parts are those which should be weighted.</p>
</div>

<p>Provided the inner ski is brought <em>parallel</em> to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
the outer one, it does not matter if it comes to the
snow again <em>before</em> the latter has skidded round
to right angles, for then the turn can be finished
with both skis side-slipping together&mdash;that is
to say, the turn can begin as a stemming turn
and finish as a Christiania, a most useful combination
which is beginning to be known by the
dreadful name &#8220;Stemmiania,&#8221; which I only quote
in order to record my dislike for it.</p>

<p>This way of making the turn is practically
instantaneous, and is so convenient that when
you have once learnt it you will hardly ever use
the one I described first. By means of it you
can stop suddenly when moving at a very fair
rate, especially if you stem hard with both skis
well edged inwards just before making the turn.</p>

<p>Practise this movement without skis at first,
and then at a standstill with skis, on the most
slippery snow you can find, trying to make the
outer ski spin right round to right angles.</p>

<p>These uphill stemming turns enable you to
stop yourself wherever the quality of the snow
and the gradient allow you to hold the double-stemming
position while running straight downhill.
It is no use attempting to make them on
very steep slopes or in snow into which the skis
sink deeply; in either of these cases you will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
have to stop yourself by means of the Telemark
or Christiania swings, described later.</p>

<p>I need hardly say that if you merely wish to
alter your course and not to stop yourself, you
can finish the turn at any point. You either
wait until the outer, weighted ski is pointing in
the direction you want to go, and then bring the
other ski parallel to it in the normal position
and run on at full speed; or, if you still wish
to brake, you turn rather farther until the
inner ski is in line with your intended course,
and then shift the weight partly or entirely to
that one and run on stemming.</p>

<p><em>Downhill Turn to the Left.</em>&mdash;A turn made in a
downward direction in order to join one tack to
another when descending a hill in zigzags is often
called an &#8220;S&#8221; turn, on account of the shape of
the track left by a number of these turns made
in alternate directions (Plates <a href="#plate26">XXVI.</a>, <a href="#plate33">XXXIII.</a>,
<a href="#plate42">XLII.</a>).</p>

<p>Any downhill turn, therefore, whether made
by the stemming turn or by any other means,
can be called an &#8220;S&#8221; turn. A good many people,
however, having never seen a downhill turn made
by any other means than the stemming turn&mdash;or
at least the awkward man&oelig;uvre which the
average runner imagines to be the stemming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
turn&mdash;believe &#8220;S&#8221; turn and stemming turn to
be synonymous.</p>

<p>As will be seen later on, a downhill or &#8220;S&#8221;
turn can quite well be made by means of the
Telemark or Christiania
swings, the &#8220;S&#8221; having
no reference whatever to
stemming.</p>

<p>To avoid confusion, I
shall not use the term
&#8220;S&#8221; turn at all, but only
speak of a downhill turn.</p>

<div class="figright">
<a id="fig34"></a><img src="images/fig34.jpg" width="159" height="300" alt="Figure 34" title="Figure 34" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 34.</span>&mdash;Downhill stemming turn to left (3, 4, and 5).</p>
<p class="caption2">The blackened parts are those which should be weighted.</p>
</div>

<p>The best way to practise
the turn at first is to
run, as before, straight
downhill in the double
stemming position for a
few yards, then throw
the weight on the left
ski as if you meant to
turn uphill to the right
and stop (<a href="#fig34">Fig. 34</a>, <em>1</em> and <em>2</em>), but just before the
left ski points horizontally across the hill,
transfer the weight to the heel of the right
foot, and face round to the left a little.</p>

<p>You will find yourself beginning to turn downhill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
again&mdash;the left ski falling a little behind the
other as you do so&mdash;and by keeping the weight
on the right foot you will go round until you face
across the slope in the opposite direction (<a href="#fig34">Fig. 34</a>,
<em>3</em>, <em>4</em>, and <em>5</em>), when you can shift the weight to
the left foot and reverse the process.</p>

<p>By repeating this you will descend the hill in
short zigzags.</p>

<p>The important points are&mdash;(1) to hold the
stemming position unaltered with the knees
straight, the heels of the skis wide apart, and the
tips close together; (2) to throw the weight well
on to the outer ski; and (3) not to let the inner
ski get in front.</p>

<p>The last half of the turn, from the point at
which you are facing straight downhill, is, of
course, really an uphill one, identical with what
you have already learnt, and can be finished at
any point in any of the ways already described.</p>

<p>You can start a downhill turn, like an uphill
one, from the normal position while running
across a slope, and under these conditions the
turn is, as in the case of the uphill one, rather
less easy; this time, however, it is extremely
important to be able to do it, for this is by far
the most useful application of the stemming
turn, and you can in this way, provided the snow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
be suitable, join one tack to another on a slope
of any steepness, where it would be impossible
to run straight downhill in double stemming
position.</p>

<p>Suppose you wish to start a downhill turn to
the left while running at a gentle gradient across
a slope in the normal position (<em>i.e.</em> with the
weight on the left foot and the right foot in
front), the first thing to do is to turn the right
knee and ankle inwards so as to lift the outer edge
of the ski as much as possible. Then, keeping
the point of the right ski ahead of the other,
push its heel uphill and out to the position of
<em>2</em>, <a href="#fig35">Fig. 35</a>, <span class="smcap">b</span>, at the same time weighting the
<em>toe</em> of the <em>left</em> foot and slightly flattening that
ski, which will then begin to point downwards
and give the other more room to turn. As
they turn downwards push their heels wide
apart and throw your weight quickly outwards
so that a final thrust of the left leg sends it
<em>full on to the right heel</em> just as you face straight
downhill. Almost simultaneously lift the left
ski round to the side of the other and finish
the turn with the skis parallel.</p>

<p>As you lift the inner ski turn (not <em>lean</em>) the
body inwards just enough to face squarely
towards the point of the outer ski.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>If you turn slowly there will be an interval
between the pushing round of the outer ski and
the final thrust of the inner leg during which
the skis will be equally weighted. If you turn
sharply while running fast the checking of the
outer ski&#8217;s speed as it comes broadside on will
throw the weight on it at once and lift the
inner ski without an effort.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a id="fig35"></a><img src="images/fig35.jpg" width="400" height="334" alt="Figure 35" title="Figure 35" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 35.</span>&mdash;Downhill stemming turn to left (two methods).</p>
<p class="caption2">The blackened parts are those which should be weighted.</p>
</div>

<p>It is also possible to make the turn by putting
the weight on the outer ski <em>before</em> it begins to
stem at all, and making it turn downhill by
pressing on the toe (as in <a href="#fig35">Fig. 35</a>, <span class="smcap">a</span>). I used to
think this method the easier of the two, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
have changed my mind about it, and can only
apologise for leading people astray.</p>

<p>Up to this point you have been practising
on moderate slopes only, but it is on steep slopes
that you will generally have to use the downhill
stemming turn, and it is on steep slopes that you
should practise it the instant that you can do it
neatly on a gentle one.</p>

<p>You will then find a difficulty that has probably
not bothered you much so far. On a
steep slope, as you begin to turn downhill, the
increase of speed is sudden and considerable, and
if you do not compensate for this by throwing
the weight more and more forwards, the skis
will shoot from under you, and you will sit
down.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t, however, begin leaning downhill <em>too
soon, while still facing across the slope</em>, for that
will throw the weight on to the inside (lower)
ski. Simply lean as far forwards over the front
of your skis as possible, so that as they turn
downhill your weight will be well over them.</p>

<p>The difficulty of leaning forward sufficiently
on a steep slope is partly due to the tendency
to stand with the weight vertically above the
feet, as one would do when <em>walking</em> downhill.
The very best plan for overcoming this difficulty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
and one which will make it infinitely easier for
you to perform the turn quickly and correctly,
is to keep your eyes fixed on the ground at your
feet while you are turning, and to imagine that
it is almost or quite level. You will then
naturally hold yourself at right angles to the
slope no matter how steep that may be.</p>

<p>You will find this downhill turn of very little
practical use on a steep slope until you can make
it quite shortly and sharply; for if you make
a long curve, the pace increases so much in the
middle of it that you are almost sure to lose
control, and fail to finish the turn, even if you
do not fall down.</p>

<p>The reason why to lift round the inner ski at
the middle of the turn is safer than to keep
it on the snow throughout is because the curve
is thus considerably shortened.</p>

<p>The act of suddenly throwing yourself very
far forward over the front of your skis as you
face downhill will make them hang back a little
for an instant&mdash;all the more so for the fact that
at this point the stemming action of both is
at its maximum&mdash;and at this moment it is easy
to give a push with, and then to lift round, the
inner ski.</p>

<p>Be careful, in lifting the ski round, to bring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
it down again exactly parallel to the outer ski;
for the inner one, if it comes down pointing
<em>towards</em> the outer one, will instantly run across
it and upset you; while if pointing <em>away</em>, it will
run uphill and draw your feet apart with a jerk
that will probably have the same result.</p>

<p>Although, as I have said, you should turn the
body a little in throwing the weight outwards, it is
no use attempting to lean or swing it the way you
<em>want</em> to go. You must simply throw it forwards
and <em>outwards</em>&mdash;that is, rather <em>away</em> from where
you want to go. If you lean the way you want
to go you will simply put weight on the inner ski,
which will then either trip you up or make you
run away straight downhill instead of finishing
the turn. Indeed, paradoxical as it may sound,
you should, in a sense, try <em>not</em> to turn; man&oelig;uvre
your skis as I have directed, and <em>try to keep a
straight course, turning sideways as you do so</em>,
and you will probably come round without difficulty.</p>

<p>The faster you are running at the moment
of beginning the turn, the more difficulty you
will at first have in making it.</p>

<p>You had better, therefore, when learning it,
run at a gradient which will only just allow
you to keep moving smoothly (I am speaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
of the gradient of your course across the slope,
<em>not</em> of the gradient of the slope itself), otherwise,
before beginning the turn, you may be inclined
to stem with the lower ski in order to check the
pace, and, when the lower ski is put in stemming
position before the other is pushed round,
there is a tendency for the weight to get too
far back in the effort of starting the turn, which
then misses fire. If you are bound to slow up
before you begin the turn, do so by side-slipping
with both skis and turning a little uphill (<em>i.e.</em>
make a slight Christiania swing) as described in
the last section, <a href="#Page_131">p. 131</a>.</p>

<p>On an icy and steep slope it is, of course,
especially necessary to make the turn very sharply
if you are not to lose control in the middle
of it. You can do this by running very slowly
before turning, and then quickly putting the upper
ski far round, and simultaneously weighting it
by means of what is practically a <em>jump</em> from the
other ski, which comes into the air almost before
the first is weighted, and is brought down
parallel with it almost instantly. This is well
worth practising assiduously, for it makes all the
difference to the safety of a turn on very steep
and icy ground.</p>

<p>Do not be contented until you can make a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
short, sharp turn (both to right and left, of course)
with perfect steadiness, on the steepest slope
you can find. For although on steep slopes a
Telemark or Christiania swing is the best way
of making an <em>uphill</em> turn, there is no means so
reliable as the stemming turn for turning <em>downhill</em>,
no matter how steep the slope, <em>provided the
snow is hard, or that, if soft, it is shallow</em>. It
is almost useless, though, to attempt it in deep
soft snow. At the best you will probably only
get half-way round with an uncomfortable effort,
and then the inner ski will be forced back, and
come round after the other in Telemark position,
in which, as you will find later, it might just as
well have started.</p>

<p>At the worst you may be tempted to drag
yourself round with the stick in the position
shown in the photograph (<a href="#plate28">Plate XXVIII.</a>).</p>

<p>This position, which, I hope, is becoming less
fashionable, is the very essence of incorrectness
and awkwardness, and is an infallible sign
either of poor nerve or of bad teaching. Here
the weight falls principally on the inside ski
and the stick, instead of entirely on the outer
ski, while the skis are held parallel, or nearly
so, instead of in the [V] position. The general
position is a crouching one with the knees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
bent, instead of an erect one with straight
and rigid legs; except for a feeble stemming
action of the outer ski, which is too much edged,
the turning effect is entirely due to the drag
of the stick. Those who make use of this
method generally refer to it as a stemming turn,
&#8220;S&#8221; turn, or Alpine curve, using either of these
terms in contradistinction to the terms &#8220;Telemark&#8221;
and &#8220;Christiania,&#8221; evidently under the
impression that an &#8220;S&#8221; curve can only be
made by stemming, and that by means of the
Telemark or Christiania it is only possible to
turn uphill and stop. The only correct title
for this man&oelig;uvre is &#8220;stick turn.&#8221;</p>

<p>When I say that this method is awkward and
incorrect, I do not merely mean that it is ugly,
for I suppose that to the unsophisticated eye its
attitude is no more ugly than the exaggerated
straddle of the correct stemming position. There
are two strong reasons for considering it execrable
in style and utterly to be avoided.</p>

<p>In the first place it is a waste of energy,
because it takes a considerable muscular effort
to make a turn in this way, even when the snow
is easy, and an exhausting one when it is not;
while by substituting correct methods one can
always turn without the smallest strain. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
second objection to it is that it is inefficient, for
by turning in this way it is impossible to make a
short curve, especially in deep soft snow; and
until a runner can turn sharply in snow of any
quality and on a slope of any steepness (I do
not say at any speed), he by no means can be
said to have proper control of his skis. I do
not for a moment deny that it is the easiest way
of turning, in the sense that it is the one requiring
the least skill. But any one who knows
what can be done by correct methods, who has
ordinary nerve, and who does not look on ski-running
solely as a means of locomotion, for which
a technique demanding the minimum of skill is
the one to be preferred, will shun the &#8220;stick
turn&#8221; as he would the pestilence.</p>

<p>Finally, let me remind you once more that in
stemming&mdash;and this holds equally good whether
you are turning or going straight ahead&mdash;the
skis should never be quite flat; their outer
edges must be lifted a little even when the snow
is easy, rather more so when it is not (see
<a href="#Page_83">p. 83</a>).</p>

<p>To be quite accurate I ought to have said the
skis must not be <em>kept</em> flat, for obviously they
must during a downhill turn each pass through
the flat position, since their edging, on the tack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
before the turn, is the reverse of what it is on the
tack that follows it. This change of edge, as a
matter of fact, constitutes one of the difficulties
of the turn. The outer ski makes the change
easily enough, for the outer ankle (which is bent
inwards in order to start the turn) does not have
to alter its position while the change of edge
takes place. But the inner ski, if kept on the
snow throughout the turn, is by no means easy
to manage at the moment that the change has to
be made. This ski remains on its inside edge
until nearly the end of the turn, and if allowed
to remain so for a moment too long is very apt to
catch on this edge and run across the other or
refuse to come round, especially on a steep slope,
if (as he should have done) the runner has made
a very wide straddle when facing straight downhill.</p>

<p>This difficulty is entirely avoided when the
turn is finished by the <em>lifting</em> of the inner ski
(the change of edge then taking place, so to
speak, in the air). Indeed, although this lifting
of the ski may sound somewhat acrobatic to any
one who has not tried it, it is really quite the
reverse. It needs far less adroitness than does a
neat and steady finish of the turn with the ski
kept on the snow, and is, in fact, not only the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
quicker and more effective, but also considerably
the easier and safer of the two methods.</p>

<p>The runner can only make a true stemming
turn when going at a moderate pace. By finishing
it as a Christiania, however, he can turn either
uphill or downhill when going much faster. In
fact the sooner the skis are brought parallel, the
greater the pace at which the turn can be started;
at very high speeds only a trifling preliminary
stem being either necessary or safe.</p>


<h4 style="font-weight: normal;"><em>Short Directions for a Downhill Stemming

<p>From normal running position, right foot leading,

<p>Bending and turning inwards right knee, ankle,

forwards to the widest possible stemming position&mdash;its

the same time slightly flattening the <em>left</em> ski and
pressing on its <em>toe</em>. As the skis turn downwards
push their heels wide apart, quickly shift your
weight forwards and outwards, and, with a push
from the inner ski, throw it <em>full on the right heel</em>
as you face straight downhill&mdash;at the same time

<p>Fix the eyes on the tips of the skis and try to

<p><em>N.B.</em>&mdash;The latter half of this turn is, of course,
really an uphill one, separate directions for which
are therefore unnecessary.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_TELEMARK_SWING" id="THE_TELEMARK_SWING"></a>THE TELEMARK SWING</h3>


<p>Although by stemming you can make either
up or downhill turns with perfect ease either on
a hard icy surface or in shallow loose snow, you
will find it very difficult, if not impossible, to make
a stemming turn in loose snow of more than a
certain depth or density&mdash;unless you drag yourself
round with the stick. By means of the
Telemark swing, however, you can easily make
turns in any sort of loose snow, and can do so
on any slope, no matter how steep it may be.</p>

<p>If you can already both run and stem in the
Telemark position, with either foot leading, you
will find it a very simple matter to learn the
swing. In fact you may be said to have <em>learnt</em>
it after a fashion, for to stop by Telemark stemming
is to make a clumsy Telemark uphill turn.
For practising this swing, find a moderate slope
where the snow is soft and, for choice, deep
or dense enough to make a stemming turn
difficult.</p>


<p><em>Uphill Turn to the Left.</em>&mdash;Run at a gentle
gradient across the slope with the hill on your
left and the weight on the lower (right) foot,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
not, however, in the normal position, with the
left foot advanced, but in the Telemark position,
with the right foot leading.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a id="fig36"></a><img src="images/fig36.jpg" width="400" height="302" alt="Figure 36" title="Figure 36" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 36.</span>&mdash;Uphill Telemark swings to left (<span class="smcap">a</span> from a traversing,
<span class="smcap">b</span> from a direct descent).</p>
<p class="caption2">The blackened parts are those which should be weighted.</p>
</div>

<p>The left ski should then be so far back that its
bend is level with the right ankle, the left heel
should be raised, and the left leg perfectly relaxed,
with the knee nearly touching the ski. The
right knee should be perpendicularly over the
foot, and <em>both knees be pressed inwards</em>. This is
only preparatory, and you should, in this position,
be able to run directly across the slope at whatever
gradient you choose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as you are fairly under weigh, make
the swing as follows:</p>

<p>Turn the right knee and foot a little inwards,
placing the front ski slightly at an angle with
the other; at the same time edge the right ski
inwards and put the whole weight on the right
<em>heel</em>, pressing it down and trying to lift the
toes.</p>

<p>You will at once begin to turn uphill. The
moment you start turning lean <em>more forwards</em>
and face full towards the point of the front ski.
As you stop moving weight the toe of the front
foot, press the back knee inwards, and so bring
the skis parallel.</p>

<p>Unless you are on the look-out for it, you will
find a tendency, as you begin the turn, to lean
inwards (towards the hill), or backwards, putting
weight on the left foot, and at the same time to
straighten the right knee and relax the right
ankle, more or less flattening the ski (<a href="#plate30">Plate XXX.</a>).
As a result you will, if you do not fall inwards at
once, probably finish the swing in an awkward
straddled position, the right ski pointing uphill,
almost at right angles to the other ski, which will
not have altered its direction, and the weight on
both feet. Or else you will find that the weight
on the left ski will make it run up level with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
other again, which will prevent you from turning,
or across it, which will throw you down.</p>

<p>It will help you to avoid this inward lean
if you remember that, as explained on <a href="#Page_82">p. 82</a>,
your right ski in turning does not cut round
directly as a skate does, but slips sideways as
well as forwards, and that, therefore, during the
swing your right <em>foot</em>, instead of moving more
and more to the left of your original line of
progress, will at first move to the right of, or
below it; and, if the hill is steep or the snow
shallow, will hardly be above it even at the end
of the swing. It is obvious, then, that if
you are to remain properly balanced on your
right ski, very little inward lean is necessary,
and the usual directions for leaning the body
inwards while making the swing are most
misleading. In fact, although one really has to
lean inwards when the turn has begun, the
instinct to avoid an outward fall makes one
overdo this to such an extent that at first it
is better to try to throw the weight rather to
the right and outwards, downhill (but well
<em>forwards</em>), in order to get the proper balance.</p>

<p>In the Telemark swing the edging of the
leading ski is an important factor in the turn,
and there is more forward motion in proportion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
to the side-slip than in the stemming turn, which
is almost entirely a skidding turn. Indeed,
when the swing is made while running fast in
deep soft snow (which reduces the side-slip to
a minimum), the runner, as he comes at right
angles to his original course at the end of the
swing, may find it necessary to lean consciously
inwards, but only at the end&mdash;<em>never under any
circumstances at the beginning of the swing</em>.</p>

<p>In this swing, as in the stemming turn, it
is a mistake, when practising, to look the way
you <em>want</em> to go, as is sometimes advised. You
must only look <em>the way you are actually going
at the moment</em>&mdash;<em>i.e.</em> rather to the outside of the
point of the leading ski.</p>

<p>It is also useless to try to <em>force</em> the turn
by swinging the body or in any other way;
and, as in the stemming turn, it is better to
think nothing at all about turning, simply
confining your attention to the weighting and
position of the skis, and trying, in a sense, to
go straight on. The great thing at first is to
prevent the weight getting back on the back
foot.</p>

<p>There is, of course, no real necessity for running
in the Telemark position before beginning the
swing, but to do so whilst learning it gives you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
less to think about when starting the turn.
As soon as you get a little accustomed to it
you can run in normal position with the upper
foot leading until you wish to turn, and can then
drop into Telemark position, lower foot leading,
and begin the swing simultaneously.</p>

<p>When you can make the swing to the left, run
across the slope in the opposite direction, and
learn to make it to the right in the same way
(of course substituting &#8220;left&#8221; for &#8220;right&#8221; and
&#8220;right&#8221; for &#8220;left&#8221; in the directions).</p>

<p>When you can do this, practise it to the left
again, this time running more directly downhill
than at first, and then in the same way to the
right, until you can at last swing to a standstill
either right or left when running <em>straight</em>
downhill (<a href="#fig36">Fig. 36</a>, <span class="smcap">b</span>). But do not, at any stage,
run far before beginning to swing; get fairly
under weigh and make the swing, then run on
and do it again, and so on until you have gone
as far as you wish. In this way you will get
less climbing uphill in proportion to the amount
of practice.</p>

<p>It is at the end of a swing made when running
straight downhill that you are almost sure to
find it necessary to lean inwards if the snow is
deep and the speed high, but till you find a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
distinct tendency to fall outwards you need not
concern yourself about it.</p>

<p>Of course, instead of coming to a standstill
at the end of a swing, you can, if you wish,
stop turning before the leading ski comes to
a horizontal position, and can run on obliquely
down the hill. In order to do this you have
only, as soon as the leading ski is pointing the
way you want to go, to shift the weight from
the heel to the toe, stand erect, and bring the
back ski to the front in the normal position.</p>

<p>As soon as you can swing both to left and
right when running straight downhill, learn to
make a downhill turn (&#8220;S&#8221; turn), which will
enable you to join one tack to another when
descending a slope in zigzags.</p>

<p><em>Downhill Turn to the Left.</em>&mdash;In this use of
the swing the skis are held as before, and
weighted in much the same way, but there are
one or two points to be noticed.</p>

<p>Run across the slope at a moderate gradient
with the hill on your right, in Telemark position
with the right foot leading (or start in normal
position, and when you mean to turn, shift the
weight from left foot to right and drop back
the left ski).</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a id="fig37"></a><img src="images/fig37.jpg" width="400" height="257" alt="Figure 37" title="Figure 37" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 37.</span>&mdash;Downhill Telemark swing to left at various stages.</p>
<p class="caption2">The blackened parts are those which should be weighted.</p>
</div>

<p>Then, lifting the outer edge of the right ski,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
turn the right foot and knee inwards, and so
place the ski at a slight angle with the other, as
in starting an uphill swing. But, while in an
uphill swing this angle should be very slight
indeed and the body should <em>immediately</em> turn
towards the point of the front ski, in a downhill
swing the angle must be a trifle wider, and the
body must remain facing the point of the <em>back</em>
ski until both have turned far enough for the
front one to point nearly straight downhill. The
stemming of the front ski, in fact, and the combined
steering action of both, which in an uphill
turn should hardly be perceptible, should in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
downhill one be more pronounced. The weight,
moreover, must just at first be placed on the
<em>toe</em> of the front foot to help that ski to turn
downwards.</p>

<p>The moment you are fairly heading downhill,
throw the whole weight on to the <em>heel</em> of the
front ski, face towards its point, and finish the
swing as before (<a href="#fig37">Fig. 37</a>).</p>

<p>The faster you are running at the moment
of beginning the swing, the sooner you can
transfer the weight from the toe to the heel,
and face in the direction of the leading ski; in
fact, from a <em>very</em> fast traverse, a downhill Telemark
swing is practically made in exactly the
same way as an uphill one, the preliminary stem
of the front ski and the weighting of the toe
being barely perceptible.</p>

<p>In putting the weight on the toe at the
beginning of the swing, take great care not
to poke the foot forward, but to keep the knee
well over it; otherwise you are sure to take
the weight right off it.</p>

<p>Be on your guard also against the tendency
to try to start the swing by <em>leaning</em> to the left,
for, if you do this, you will either fall downhill or
get the skis apart. Simply lean well forward,
look in that direction only, and don&#8217;t think of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
trying to turn, but rather try to go on across
the slope, letting your skis carry you round.</p>

<p>As you turn downwards of course the pace
increases, and you must lean more forward, but
you will find it less difficult to do this sufficiently
during the Telemark swing than during a stemming
turn. The great secret is to keep the right
knee well forward over the foot, to try to lean
over the front of the ski, and to keep your
eyes on the ground at your feet, trying to
imagine it flat, as I advised in the case of the
stemming turn.</p>

<p>The Telemark swing, when executed correctly,
at high speed, requires no sustained muscular
effort except that of holding the leading ski on its
inside edge and pressing down the heel. In deep
soft snow this is easy enough, if the knee is
well over the leading foot and all the weight
on that ski, but in shallow snow it is sometimes
difficult, at a high speed, to prevent the
ankle from bending outwards, which flattens
the ski and makes it skid outwards with an
irregular, jerky movement, leaving the weight
on the back foot. To prevent this, press the
knee in well, turn the outside of the foot hard
upwards, and press the toe upwards against
the toe-strap.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>This will give the sensation of grinding the
inner side of the heel into the snow, and you
should try to increase the pressure as the swing
proceeds.</p>

<p>Strictly speaking, a very slight flattening of
the front ski hastens the start of an uphill swing
<em>from a traverse</em>. But this flattening should be
merely momentary, and it is so difficult to make
it so and <em>instantly</em> to edge the ski again that it
is safer to leave it out altogether.</p>

<p>Neither allow the back ski to come forward to
the normal position, nor weight it until the swing
is quite finished and you are either standing still
or running off in a new direction.</p>

<p>It may seem that, owing to the position, the
Telemark swing calls for more delicate balancing
than the other methods of turning. There is
really not so much difference, for in either the
stemming turn or, as will be seen later, in one
form of the Christiania swing, when these are
properly executed, the weight must for a time be
balanced almost entirely on one ski. It is, however,
more difficult to avoid a fall in case of an
error of balance or of unexpected side-slip in the
Telemark swing than in the Christiania or stemming
turns, for in the two latter the unweighted
foot is in a position to receive the weight and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
help the balance, while in the former it can only
do so in a very slight degree. Moreover, it is
especially at the <em>finish</em> of the swing (when balancing
is most difficult), in the Telemark, that the
weight must be <em>entirely</em> on the one ski, while
both the Christiania and stemming turn can, and
should, be finished with the weight equally on
both. If, however, the Telemark is only employed
in soft snow of fair depth, the side-slip
will be slight and perfectly regular, and for that
reason will not disturb the balance much.</p>

<p>On an icy surface, or in shallow loose snow,
although it is easy enough to come round with
a Telemark swing, the irregular side-slip as the
swing ends makes it difficult to keep the balance;
but on snow of this kind, which is particularly
suitable for the stemming turn or Christiania,
there is no necessity to use the Telemark at all.</p>

<p>Practise this swing at first on a moderate
slope, and then on steeper ones, until you can
finally make short downhill turns on the steepest
slope you can find. But do not, at any rate at
first, waste time in trying to learn it where the
quality of snow makes it difficult.</p>

<p>If at first, through nervousness or bad balance,
you have much difficulty with the Telemark, you
can learn it by easy stages either (1) from a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
standstill, (2) from the snow-plough position, or
(3) from Telemark stemming.</p>

<p>(1) Place yourself in the starting position of
<a href="#plate13">Plate XIII</a>. Throw your weight full on to
the heel of the right ski, pushing it a trifle
farther outwards as you do so, and sinking into
Telemark position as it slides off. If you almost
simultaneously face round towards its point and
bring the other ski to its side by pressing the left
knee inwards, you will swing round to the left to
a standstill almost before you have moved.</p>

<p>Or, holding yourself back with your sticks, you
can place your skis in Telemark position, both
pointing straight downhill. Then letting your
sticks go, you can swing round instantly to a
standstill.</p>

<p>(2) While snow-ploughing straight downhill,
throw the whole weight out on to the heel of one
ski, turning towards its point as you do so, and
dropping the other back into Telemark position.
A downhill turn, in the same way, can, as I have
already said, be started by snow-ploughing and
finished as a Telemark.</p>

<p>(3) To learn a downhill swing, traverse very
slowly in Telemark position, upper ski leading,
but <em>kneeling down on and fully weighting the
lower ski</em>, then turn the upper ski steadily as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
far round as possible into Telemark stemming
position pointing downhill, immediately afterwards
shifting the weight gradually forwards on
to it, but <em>not letting the angle between the skis
diminish until you are facing straight downhill</em>,
when you can turn towards the front ski&#8217;s point
and bring the other round parallel.</p>

<p>I mention these kindergarten methods of
learning the swing because I have found them
really valuable for giving a nervous beginner
confidence, but, if you try them, you must remember
that to start the swing either from snow-ploughing
or pronounced Telemark stemming is
an exceedingly clumsy way of doing it, and only
possible at very low speeds.</p>

<p>There is always a suspicion of stemming at the
start of even an expert&#8217;s swing, and therefore, to
be quite accurate, the weight is never <em>entirely</em> on
the front ski at the outset, for it is of course
impossible to place the front ski at an angle with
the other without using the latter as a purchase,
and so weighting it slightly. But the whole
essence of a good swing, which can be made,
steadily and easily, at top speed, is that the
preliminary stem and consequent weighting of
the back ski is reduced to a minimum&mdash;is in fact
imperceptible, the runner&#8217;s weight coming on to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
the heel of the front ski at the very outset and
being practically the sole factor in the turn.</p>

<p>By means of this swing it is even possible to
make turns in a breakable crust, if that is not
very thick, and if great care is taken to hold
and weight the skis correctly.</p>

<p>The bend of the back ski must always be
in contact with the front ankle. The back knee
must therefore be pressed slightly inwards even
when the skis are at an angle with each other.</p>


<h4 style="font-weight: normal;"><em>Short Directions for an Uphill Telemark
Swing to the Left</em></h4>

<p><em>Preparatory.</em>&mdash;With the right foot leading
and weighted sink to a semi-kneeling position,
the right knee perpendicularly above the foot,
the left leg relaxed, the left heel raised, and the
left knee almost touching the ski, both knees
pressed a little inwards, the bend of the left
ski level with the ankle of the right foot, and
close against it.</p>

try to lean in that direction only, <em>not inwards</em>.</p>

<p><em>N.B.</em>&mdash;A downhill turn is made in the same
way, except that, to <em>start</em> the swing, the <em>toe</em> of
the right foot must be weighted for a moment.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_CHRISTIANIA_SWING" id="THE_CHRISTIANIA_SWING"></a>THE CHRISTIANIA SWING</h3>


<p>A Christiania is any turn in which the <em>outer</em>
ski does <em>not lead</em>, and the skis are <em>not</em> held <em>convergently</em>,
<em>i.e.</em> the skis may be either parallel or
<em>di</em>vergent, and either held level or with the inner
leading.</p>

<p>This swing is, according to the purpose for
which it is used, and the state of the snow,
either an extremely difficult or the very easiest
way of turning or stopping.</p>

<p>It is easiest on a hard icy crust (not a
breakable one) either with or without a shallow
covering of loose snow, and therefore for learning
it one should find snow of this sort. Most
practice-grounds, trodden hard by ski-tracks,
are just the thing. The gradient is not so important,
for it is quite as easy to learn this
swing on a steepish slope as on a moderate one.
I have already shown (<a href="#Page_138">p. 138</a>) how an uphill
Christiania may be started from a traverse by
side-slipping, and also how a stemming turn
may be finished as a Christiania (<a href="#Page_143">p. 143</a>). The
following method is more generally useful, and a
steadier way of making the swing at a high speed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Uphill Turn to the Right.</em>&mdash;In the normal
position, run across the slope at a gentle
gradient with the hill on your right, your
weight on the left ski, the right ski about a
foot in advance.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a id="fig38"></a><img src="images/fig38.jpg" width="400" height="340" alt="Figure 38" title="Figure 38" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 38.</span>&mdash;Uphill Christiania swing to right (<span class="smcap">a</span> from a traverse,
<span class="smcap">b</span> from a direct descent.)</p>
<p class="caption2">The blackened parts are those which should be weighted.</p>
</div>

<p>When fairly under weigh lean well forwards,
bend the front knee, shift most of the weight
from the left foot to the right <em>heel</em>, and slide the
left ski about six inches farther to the rear,
turning its point slightly outwards, <em>i.e.</em> downhill,
so that it takes the position shown in
<a href="#fig38">Fig. 38</a>, <span class="smcap">a</span>, <em>1</em>, and at the same time <em>flattening</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
it by bending the left knee and ankle well
outwards (<a href="#plate34">Plate XXXIV.</a>).</p>

<p>Owing partly to the steering effect produced
by the relative position of the two skis and partly
to the pressure on the heel of the right ski (a
very slight momentary flattening of which will
help the turn to start if it hangs fire at
all), you will instantly begin to turn uphill.
Immediately after beginning to turn press the
left ski quickly inwards and forwards again
to the normal position. As it again comes
parallel to the other it may be edged and its
left heel receive half the weight; <em>until then it
must be kept flat</em>.</p>

<p>If you do all this correctly you should come
to a standstill with the skis pointing more or
less uphill, in the normal position, right ski
leading (<a href="#fig38">Fig. 38</a>, <span class="smcap">a</span>, <em>3</em>).</p>

<p>The difficulty in this, as in all the turns, is, at
the start, to keep most of the weight on one ski
only. When, at the beginning of the swing, the
weight has once been shifted on to the right ski,
it must be kept there until the skis are brought
parallel again. It is in order to ensure doing this
that it is necessary to lean forwards, and keep the
right knee well over the foot. This may appear
likely to throw the weight on the toes, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
tendency for that to happen is really less when
the leg is in this position than when it is
straighter. A slight lifting of the left heel
will lessen the tendency to throw weight on
that foot.</p>

<p>If much weight is put on the left foot it will
be difficult to hold the skis at the narrow angle
shown in the diagram, especially if the left ski
has not been flattened, but is still on its inside
edge. The skis, then, instead of turning together,
will probably run apart in the directions
in which they are pointing (<a href="#plate37">Plate XXXVII.</a>).</p>

<p>In this swing, as in the Telemark, the tendency
of the beginner is to lean too much inwards,
towards the hill. What I said in this connection
when describing the Telemark swing is equally
applicable here, and to save you from referring
back I will repeat it.</p>

<p>As explained on <a href="#Page_82">page 82</a>, a ski can never cut
round like a skate, but slips sideways, in turning,
as well as forwards; and the shallower the snow,
the steeper the hill, and the higher the speed,
the greater is this side-slip. In making this
turn to the right, therefore, your right foot,
instead of moving at once to the <em>right</em> of the
line of your previous course, will at first move
to the <em>left</em> of, and below it; and, if the hill is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
steep or the snow shallow, may still be on its
left even at the end of the swing, though the
fact that the points of the skis remain on the
other side of the line prevents this from being
apparent at first (<a href="#fig38">Fig. 38</a>).</p>

<p>It is obvious, then, that if you are to remain
properly balanced on your right ski, very little
inward lean is necessary, and the usual directions
as to leaning the body inwards while making the
swing are most misleading.</p>

<p>In fact, although one really has to lean inwards
when the turn has begun, the instinct to avoid
an outward fall makes one overdo it to such an
extent that at first it is better to try to throw
the weight rather to the left and downhill&mdash;but
<em>forwards</em>, not backwards, on to the left ski&mdash;in
order to get the proper balance.</p>

<p>One must try to encourage the side-slip, not
to check it; and the only way to do this is to
try to throw the weight slightly outwards, or,
at any rate, to guard against the least tendency
to lean in, as one instinctively is inclined to do
when the side-slip begins.</p>

<p>At the end of the swing the edging of the
skis stops the side-slip, rather suddenly if one
makes a sharp turn in soft snow, and it is
only then that any conscious effort should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
made to lean inwards, <em>never at the beginning of
the swing</em>.</p>

<p>It is useless to try to hasten the swing by
turning, leaning, or swinging the body; in fact,
as I have said before, if you try to turn at all
you are almost certain to fall. If, however, you
<em>try to go straight on</em>, simply holding the skis,
and distributing the weight as I have directed,
you will probably turn without difficulty.</p>

<p>When you can make the swing to the right,
learn to make it to the left in the same way, of
course substituting left for right, and right for
left in the directions. When you can do this,
practise it to the right again, this time running
more steeply downhill than at first, and then in
the same way to the left, until you can at last
turn to right or left when running <em>straight</em>
downhill (Fig, 38, <span class="smcap">b</span>). But do not, at any stage,
run far before beginning to swing; get fairly
under weigh and make the swing, then run on
and do it again, and repeat this until you get to
the bottom of your practice slope. To run far
between each swing only gives you more climbing
in proportion to the amount of practice.</p>

<p>There is one thing to be noticed about making
the swing when running straight downhill. When
running <em>across</em> the hill the skis are edged in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
normal position, and the inner ski, which has to
be slightly edged at the start of the swing, is
therefore already about right. In running <em>straight</em>
downhill both skis are flat in the normal position;
it is therefore necessary, when turning to the
right, to edge the right ski a trifle in order to
begin the swing (<a href="#plate35">Plate XXXV.</a>).</p>

<p>The left ski is already flat; but to make sure
that it keeps so as the turn begins, slightly bow
the legs, turning both knees&mdash;especially the left&mdash;rather
outwards.</p>

<p>When running straight downhill preparatory
to swinging, always lead with the ski of the
side to which you mean to turn.</p>

<p><em>Downhill Turn to the Right.</em>&mdash;So far you have
used the swing to make an <em>uphill</em> turn, in order
to bring yourself to a standstill.</p>

<p>When using the swing in order to make a
<em>downhill</em> turn, the skis are held in exactly the
same relative positions as before, and weighted
in much the same way, but it is necessary to
notice carefully one or two details.</p>

<p>Suppose you are running across the slope with
the hill on your left and wish to turn downwards
to the right and make a fresh tack. Your weight
in the normal running position is then on the
right ski, and the left ski is advanced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a id="fig39"></a><img src="images/fig39.jpg" width="400" height="307" alt="Figure 39" title="Figure 39" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 39.</span>&mdash;Downhill Christiania swing to the right at various stages.</p>
<p class="caption2">The blackened parts are those which should be weighted.</p>
</div>

<p>In order to start the turn it is not necessary
to shift the weight, which is already on the right
ski; you have merely to turn the right knee
and ankle slightly outwards as before, and to
put the weight on the <em>toe</em> of the right foot, at
the same time sliding the left ski to the rear.
The right ski will now begin to point away from
the other and turn downhill (<a href="#fig39">Fig. 39</a>, <span class="smcap">a</span>, <em>1</em>, <em>1</em>).
Take care to bend the right ankle only <em>slightly</em>
outwards, so that the ski is not actually <em>edged</em>
outwards, but only partially or completely flattened,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
according as the slope is steep or gentle;
if there is any outward edging&mdash;or if the weight
is on the <em>heel</em>&mdash;you will fail to start the turn.</p>

<p>As the right ski begins to turn downwards,
take care that the angle between it and the
other one does not become too wide, but that
the left ski also begins to turn downhill (pressing
on it with the toes and partially flattening it by
bending the ankle <em>inwards</em> will enable it to do
so) before the right has assumed the position of
2 in the diagram. If you put much weight on
the left ski it will refuse to follow the other one
round, and will either get across the heel of it,
or run away from it and upset you.</p>

<p>The <em>right</em> knee and ankle are held in the same
position throughout the swing, and this will bring
the right ski on to its outside edge as soon as
it is pointing directly downhill (in a sense, indeed,
the right ski may be said to be &#8220;edged&#8221; throughout
the swing if that expression is merely used
to signify <em>the depression of its outer edge</em> and <em>not</em>
its <em>relation to the surface of the snow</em>).</p>

<p>The left ankle, however, after being bent a
trifle <em>inwards</em>, to start the swing, must, with the
knee, be bent more and more <em>outwards</em> as the
swing proceeds, in order to keep the left ski
perfectly flat until it can be brought back to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
the side of the other one and edged inwards as
the swing ends.</p>

<p>As soon as you have turned so far that you
are facing straight downhill, shift the weight
from the toe of the right foot to the heel and
finish the swing as before. If you make a
downhill turn very sharply while running fast
you can shift the weight from toe to heel before
you are facing downhill&mdash;in fact almost immediately
after the turn has begun. In trying to
put the weight on the toe at the beginning of
the swing, take great care not to poke the foot
forward, but to keep the knee well over it, otherwise
you are sure to put some weight back on
the left foot.</p>

<p>Be on your guard also against trying to start
the swing by <em>leaning</em> to the right, for, if you
do this, you will either fall downhill, or will
find that the right ski refuses to turn downwards.
Simply lean, as before, towards the tip
of the right ski, look in that direction only,
and don&#8217;t think of trying to turn, but rather
try to go on across the slope.</p>

<p>As you turn downwards, of course, the pace
increases, and you must therefore lean more
forwards; the great thing is to keep the right
knee well forward over the foot, to try to lean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
over the front of the ski, and to keep your eyes
on the ground at your feet, endeavouring to
imagine it flat, as I advised in the case of the
Telemark and stemming turns.</p>

<p>You will find this downhill turn of very little
practical use on a steep slope until you can make
it quite shortly and sharply, for, if you make
a long curve, the pace increases so much in the
middle of it that you are almost sure to lose
control and fail to finish the swing, even if you
do not fall down.</p>

<p>When performed in this way the Christiania
swing can be used for making either up or
downhill turns on practically any slope and in
any kind of snow except breakable crust. The
deeper, however, the skis sink into the snow, the
greater is the difficulty, not only because they
skid round less readily, but because it then needs
more force to hold the outer, back ski at a
narrow angle with the other owing to the
increased outward pressure of the snow. Unless
this ski is then held <em>perfectly flat</em> it will
instantly run apart from the other.</p>

<p>In the method just described the turn is
started by sliding <em>back</em> the ski which is to
be the <em>outer</em> one and pointing it <em>away</em> from
the side to which one is about to turn. Another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
way of starting the turn is to slide <em>forward</em>
the ski which is to be the <em>inner</em> one and point
it <em>towards</em> the side one means to turn to. This
practically amounts to the same thing looked
at from another view; the relative position
of the skis is exactly the same, and there is
very little practical difference in the making
of the turn.</p>

<p>As I find that beginners learn the swing
more easily if told to do it in the first way,
I have given these directions first, but I should
have thought myself that the swing was easier
to understand, and therefore to perform, when
considered from this second point of view.</p>

<p>Before going any further let me warn the
reader, if he is a beginner, that the next three
pages or so are not strictly practical, but are
rather meant to elucidate the theory of the
swing. If after glancing at them the reader
does not feel very hopeful of enlightenment, he
may safely skip them.</p>

<p>I have so far talked about <em>steering</em> action
starting the turn. When the swing is looked
at from this second standpoint, one can say
that <em>stemming</em> action starts it&mdash;or rather
<em>prepares</em> for it.</p>

<p>Suppose, for instance, you are traversing to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
the right at a gentle gradient, and wish to
turn uphill in this way. You are in the normal
position, left foot weighted, and right foot leading;
in order to prepare for the turn keep the left
ski edged normally and weighted, slide the right
a little farther forward, turn it rather away
from the other, <em>i.e.</em> point it about horizontally
across the slope (the gradient of your course
being very slight), and nearly flatten it by
keeping the right knee and ankle a little
inwards. What you are now doing is actually
stemming&mdash;<em>di</em>vergent stemming, not <em>con</em>vergent
like ordinary or Telemark stemming, but still
stemming; Christiania stemming if you like to
call it so. As long as you hold this position
with the left ski edged and weighted and the
body facing towards its point you will go
straight ahead at a reduced pace. You can
now stop either by stemming alone or by
stemming and turning.</p>

<p>(1) Keep the left (running) ski normally edged,
and gradually edge and weight the right stemming
ski more and more until you come to a
standstill without a change of front&mdash;a true
stemming stop, but awkward, because the skis
tend to run apart as the upper ski receives
the weight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>(2) You can stop more neatly by shifting the
weight <em>all at once</em> to the stemming ski, facing
towards its point as you do so and instantly
bringing round the lower ski&mdash;lifting it if you
like, or at any rate flattening it&mdash;to the side
of the upper. This is something between stopping
by stemming and stopping by a step
round. There is no swing about either process,
and although the last may be called a turn
because there is a change of front, it cannot
be more than a slight one, because one cannot
safely point away the upper ski at more than
a slight angle.</p>

<p>Apart from the question of speed, with the
increase of which the insecurity of any sort of
stemming always increases, you cannot, of course,
stop in either of these ways if traversing steeply
enough for the divergent upper ski to be no
longer pointing quite horizontally. You must
then do so either (3) by <em>flattening</em> the lower
ski, putting half the weight on the upper, <em>holding</em>
the divergent position until the consequent
steering action brings the upper ski horizontal
again, and <em>only then</em> putting the whole weight
on it and bringing the other parallel to it&mdash;a
pure &#8220;steered&#8221; turn, with the inevitable accompanying
drawback of the tendency of the skis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
to run apart; or (4) by shifting the weight
<em>all at once</em> to the stemming ski&mdash;<em>facing towards
its point as you do so</em>, bringing the other
(flattened) quickly parallel to it, and <em>instantly
weighting the heels of both</em> (see <a href="#Page_131">p. 131</a>), when
they will turn upwards in side-slipping and
come to a standstill. If before you make the
turn you only point the stemming ski at a
<em>very slight angle</em> away from the other, and
if you throw your weight on it and face towards
its point <em>as</em>, and not <em>after</em>, you point it outwards,
you will, by the method just described,
make what, for the sake of distinction, may
be called the &#8220;steered&#8221; Christiania in the best
way that it is possible to make it.</p>

<p>In coming to a standstill on a gentle slope
from a slow traverse by any of the methods
just described, you will find that the practical
differences between them are very small indeed;
but if running very fast you would find that
the first two were impossible, and the third
awkward and unsafe, but that by the last
(which, as I have said, is practically the same
as the method described at the beginning of
the chapter) you could, if your balance were
good, turn and stop with perfect ease and
steadiness. What I have called Christiania<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
stemming, though possible, is of so little practical
use that, in that respect, it is hardly
worth considering; but to understand how it
may be done, and its exact relation to steering,
side-slipping, &amp;c., makes it so much easier to
master the difficulties of the swing, that I have
risked exasperating the reader by describing it
at length.</p>

<p>The upshot of all this is that when the
Christiania is made in either of the ways so
far described in this chapter, whatever steering
or divergent stemming there is in it should
be reduced to a minimum.</p>

<p>In this turn, by whatever method it is made,
the main difficulty&mdash;apart from the question of
balance&mdash;is in getting the turn <em>started</em>. If
once the heel of the leading ski can be got
fairly outside the track of its point, it is easy
enough to keep the turn going. It is the
<em>starting</em> of the turn that is the main object
of the divergent position of the skis; in fact,
although this position produces <em>some</em> steering
effect as long as there is any forward motion
at all, it produces less and less as the skis
move more and more broadside on, and is
only really efficient as the turn begins. This
divergent position, indeed, although on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
whole, I think, the best possible way of starting
the swing, becomes more hindrance than help
as the turn proceeds, owing to the accompanying
tendency, if most of the weight is on the <em>inner</em>
ski, for the outer one to run away from it; or,
if the <em>outer</em> ski is most weighted, for the inner
one to whip round at right angles and cross
the other&#8217;s heel (<a href="#plate39">Plate XXXIX.</a>). You should
be careful, therefore, not to let the skis point
much apart, and not to let them do so <em>at all</em>
for a moment longer than you can help, but
as soon as you are sure the steering has done
its work thoroughly, and the heel of the front
ski has fairly begun to side-slip, should quickly
bring the skis parallel, and carry through
the rest of the turn simply by weighting
both heels.</p>

<p>In the case of an uphill turn made while
running fast, you will generally find that the
skis can be brought together again almost
instantly. The separation of the skis is then
almost imperceptible, and no doubt many runners
do it quite unconsciously. The skis merely make,
as it were, a quick snip, like a pair of scissors.</p>

<p>In order to get the skis parallel, some people
find it easier, instead of keeping the outer ski
unweighted and pressing its <em>point inwards</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
again, to shift most of the weight back and
out on to it, and so thrust its <em>heel outwards</em>.
The latter method puts the skis parallel a little
more quickly than the former, but is apt to get
them rather wide apart in doing so.</p>

<p>The two methods just described are, as I have
said, identical in principle; the divergent position
of the skis, with its accompanying steering
effect, being the main characteristic of each.
In each method, moreover&mdash;apart from the
question of balance&mdash;the only muscular effort
necessary (which should be very slight) is that
of checking and reducing the divergence of the
skis; the runner, as soon as the skis are parallel,
being carried round without any effort whatever.</p>

<p>A third method&mdash;the one usually taught&mdash;is
quite different in principle, being precisely
similar to a skating turn; that is to say, the
runner uses the inertia, or rather momentum,
of his upper body as a purchase from which,
by a muscular effort&mdash;though not necessarily
a great one&mdash;he throws both skis simultaneously
more or less athwart the line of his course;
the skis remaining parallel throughout and
acting practically as <em>one</em>. I said a muscular
effort&mdash;I ought rather to have said &#8220;<em>two</em> muscular
efforts,&#8221; for the movement which causes the skis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
to turn, though it may be very slight, and may
then appear to the onlooker&mdash;and even feel to the
expert performer&mdash;quite simple, is really a compound
one that consists of two distinct parts,
and should be learnt as such.</p>

<p>Supposing you are running straight downhill
and want to make a turn to the right in
this way, the preparation is as follows: either
slightly advance the right ski, or hold both
skis level, place the weight equally on both,
edging them very slightly to the right, bending
the knees a little, keeping both them and the
skis in close contact, and leaning well forwards.
These relative positions of the skis and legs
are, if possible, held unaltered throughout the
swing.</p>

<p>You can now make the double movement that
produces the turn.</p>

<p>(1) Without letting your head turn or
straightening yourself up, <em>swing the arms,
shoulders, and upper body well round to the
right</em>. This swinging movement should be easy
yet decided, starting gently and increasing in
force as it proceeds&mdash;in fact, as Mr. Richardson
says, it should be made &#8220;crescendo,&#8221; not &#8220;sforzando.&#8221;
It should bring you to the position of
<a href="#fig40">Fig. 40</a>, <span class="smcap">a</span>, right arm well back and left well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
across the front of the body, which should be
leaning more to its right than in the drawing,
with the hips, therefore (to keep the centre of
gravity exactly over the skis), projecting more
to their left. At the instant that the swinging
movement of the arms and shoulders brings you
into the above position&mdash;<em>i.e.</em> just before the
movement reaches its extreme limit and while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
its force is still increasing&mdash;make a sudden effort
to reverse it&mdash;that is, simultaneously <em>make a
vigorous stroke to the left with the arms, and
jerk the hips and knees round to the right</em> by
suddenly twisting the body at the waist.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<a id="fig40"></a><img src="images/fig40.jpg" width="191" height="300" alt="Figure 40" title="Figure 40" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 40.</span>&mdash;&#8220;Jerked&#8221; Christiania swing,

</div>

<div class="figright">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 41.</span></p>
</div>

<p>This reverse twist of the body has practically
no effect upon the shoulders&mdash;being there
neutralised (though this may not be obvious
at first sight) by the back-stroke of the arms&mdash;but
acts almost entirely on the <em>hips</em>, turning
them until they face even farther to the right
than did the shoulders at the end of their
previous swing. The result, therefore, of the
whole double movement, if made with force
and precision, should be that you find yourself
in the position of <a href="#fig40">Fig. 40</a>, <span class="smcap">b</span>, or <a href="#plate44">Plate XLIV.</a>&mdash;the
skis having whipped round to right angles,
or thereabouts, with their original direction&mdash;and
that, after more or less side-slip, according
to your speed and the quality of the snow, you
come to a standstill.</p>

<p>In saying that this double movement should
be made with force, I do not mean that it should
be made <em>violently</em>. If the turn is to be made
very suddenly, so that the skis whip round
instantly to right angles, some force is certainly
necessary, for then the <em>whole</em> of the turning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
movement of the skis is carried out by the
double muscular effort of the body and arms.
But this double effort&mdash;the swing of the shoulders
and the immediately following jerk of the hips&mdash;may
be, and indeed usually <em>is</em>, used merely to
<em>start</em> the turn by getting the heels of the skis
outside the track of their points; the rest of the
turn being carried through by the weighting
of the heels, in the same way that, as I have
already explained, the greater part of a steered
Christiania can so be carried through. In this
case the &#8220;swing-and-jerk,&#8221; which takes the
place of the &#8220;snip&#8221; of the skis in the other
method, may be an almost imperceptible effort,
the most obvious part of which is a slight twisting
of the hips. As absence of effort is of the
greatest importance in ski-ing, one may perhaps
say that in a sense this is the best way of
making the turn. But even though you may
seldom want to make the turn fully and instantaneously
it is extremely useful to be able
to do so in case of need, and if you have learnt
to <em>complete</em> a turn forcibly you will find it all
the easier to <em>start</em> one gently. If, however, you
never try to do more than <em>start</em> the turn with
a <em>gentle</em> swing-and-jerk, it is quite likely that
you will never do even that with real certainty&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
subtlety of a gentle movement making
it more difficult to learn correctly than a forcible
one. You are still more likely to be unsuccessful
if you leave out half the movement, as is sometimes
directed, and only try to swing the
shoulders, or to twist the hips, or if you try
to move both round simultaneously, or if, as
I myself used wrongly to direct, you treat the
double movement as two quite separate ones&mdash;a
merely preparatory turn of the shoulders with
a pause between it and the hip-jerk. Not that
the turn <em>cannot</em> be made in either of these ways;
it can in all, but only awkwardly with the help
of a good deal more force than would otherwise
be necessary. An expert making a &#8220;jerked&#8221;
Christiania&mdash;as this sort may perhaps be called,
since the jerk round of the hips and consequent
thrusting forward of the ski-heels is the crucial
part of it&mdash;whether he makes it powerfully or
gently, will do so with just the force needed and
<em>no more</em>; in other words, he will do it <em>gracefully</em>.
The essential points of the movement so made are&mdash;(1)
that it is a double one, (2) that the second
part of the movement follows the first without
the least pause, (3) that the force used, however
small, is <em>gradually increasing</em> in the first part,
<em>sudden</em> in the second, (4) <em>that each part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
movement is made with about the same strength</em>;
for feebleness in the one part has to be compensated
for by undue violence in the other.
If these four conditions are complied with the
movement will usually need very little force.</p>

<p>You had better try this swing-and-jerk movement,
first without skis, on a smooth floor, then
with skis, but at a standstill, on the slipperiest
bit of hard snow you can find&mdash;slightly convex,
for choice, so that only the middles of the skis
rest on it&mdash;before trying it while actually
running. The first time you try it you will
probably find that, in spite of the many words
I have managed to use on it, it is just what
you would do by the light of nature if asked,
without letting your face turn, to hold your feet
together and make them turn suddenly as far
round to the right as possible. You will also
find that in order to do it quickly you will
be inclined to make the movement with a bit
of a jump, and this, in fact, is the best way
to do it when on skis. There should always be
some dipping of the knees with the swing and
the least suspicion of a spring with the jerk, just
sufficient to take most of the weight off the
skis for a moment and enable them to come
round with less effort from the body. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
spring may, if the snow makes it difficult to
start the turn, be made strongly enough to
lift the skis clear of it.</p>

<p>This is the only turn on skis in which the
arms are used as an aid to turning. In the
stemming turn, the Telemark, and the other
variety of the Christiania, the arms will very
likely wave about involuntarily to help the
balance, but as far as possible they should hang
quietly by the sides, a moderately expert runner
being able to make either of these turns
with his hands in his pockets or clasped behind
his back.</p>

<p>In this form of the Christiania, however, the
double swing of the arms&mdash;especially their
back-stroke&mdash;is the greatest help, for it practically
holds the shoulders at the end of their
swing, and enables the body muscles to use
them as a purchase from which to pull the
hips round. You can easily convince yourself
of the value of free and correct arm-action in
this turn if, after making it as I have directed,
you try to turn either with your arms tightly
folded, or clasped behind your back, or by
swinging them to the right <em>only</em> and then
holding them in the position of <a href="#fig40">Fig. 40</a>, <span class="smcap">a</span>,
instead of bringing them back again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>It is naturally far easiest to make a turn in
this way on a hard smooth surface which allows
the skis to skid round freely. It is only on this
sort of snow, in fact, that the <em>whole</em> turn can be
jerked; in deep soft snow it is hardly possible
to do more than just <em>start</em> the turn by swing-and-jerking;
the heel-weighting must then do
nearly all of it. If this heel-weighting is not
timed and adjusted quite nicely, or if the skis
are edged at all hard before they have made
a considerable change of direction, the turn is
apt to miss fire altogether; it is therefore, I
think, a far less useful one to the average
performer than the &#8220;steered&#8221; variety, which
will almost always get him round somehow, even
if clumsily.</p>

<p>For anyone who can make both kinds perfectly,
the &#8220;steered&#8221; turn involves just as little effort
as the &#8220;jerked,&#8221; and I certainly advise the
beginner to get thoroughly accustomed to starting
his turns by &#8220;steering&#8221; before he learns to
&#8220;jerk&#8221; them.</p>

<p>I have only given directions for making the
&#8220;jerked&#8221; turn from a direct descent; &#8220;jerked&#8221;
turns, either uphill or downhill, can of course
be made from a traverse in just the same way.
Downhill turns are always rather more difficult<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
than uphill turns, whatever be the method of
turning; downhill &#8220;jerked&#8221; turns have the
added difficulty that if, as is generally the
case, the angle between the two tacks is a
small one, the skis have to be jerked round
farther than would usually be necessary in an
uphill turn, and the jerk therefore takes more
effort.</p>

<p>In snow which allows you to make a complete
jerked turn you can, if not running very fast,
practically stop dead, or change your course
instantaneously, by making the Christiania in
this way, for the edging of the skis, after the
turn has been made, stops the side-slip almost
before it has had time to begin.</p>

<p>If, on hard snow, you make a Christiania
(of any kind) sharply while travelling at a high
speed, you will often find that, after you have
come round, the side-slip, which will then be
very great, will be too irregular to allow you to
keep your balance without holding the skis
at some distance apart. Even a good runner
is sometimes compelled to separate his skis in
this way, but you should not do it if you can
possibly help it, and if compelled to, should
always bring the skis together as the side-slip
grows less, <em>not</em> for the look of the thing, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
because, though possible, it is difficult, if the skis
are apart, to start a swing instantly in the
other direction, as you may often wish to do.</p>

<p>The Christiania can also be started, as
Bilgeri and his school advise, and as I have
practically said already, from a very undeveloped
ordinary stemming turn. In order, for instance,
to make a swing to the left, one can
advance the <em>right</em> ski, push out its heel a
little, throw the weight on it, and face towards
its point, and can then, by instantly bringing
the left ski parallel and to the front and
weighting its heel as well as the other&#8217;s, finish
the turn as a Christiania. This is very easy
to learn, and, if the preliminary stem is reduced
to a minimum, is quite effective; but it is a
much less steady way of turning at a very
high speed than a Christiania started with the
inside ski leading, and high speed is the real
test.</p>

<p>Having said that a &#8220;jerked&#8221; Christiania is
like a skating turn, I think I had better insert
the following quotation from Mr. Richardson&#8217;s
&#8220;Shilling Ski-runner,&#8221; with the sentiment of
which I heartily agree. &#8220;The beginner should
remember that turns are only a means to an
end, and not, as in figure skating, an end in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
themselves. The real object of all ski-ing
technique is to enable the runner to cross the
snow as fast as possible, with as little effort
as possible, and as safely as possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>Any beginner who has followed me through
this chapter on the Christiania swing will probably
think that a man&oelig;uvre which takes so
much description must be appallingly difficult.
I can assure him that it is nothing of the
sort. Indeed the expert, who does it instinctively,
will no doubt wonder why on earth I
have made such a fuss about it. I do not
think, however, that I could have said much
less and yet have given a really complete
explanation of how it may be done.</p>

<p>The only authorities, as far as I know, who
have said that there is more than one way of
making the swing, are Richardson and Hoek in
<em>Der Skilauf</em>; they do not explain the difference
in the making of it, but only in its
results, giving a diagram of the tracks of two
swings, one &#8220;gerissen,&#8221; and the other &#8220;gezogen,&#8221;
<em>i.e.</em> &#8220;torn&#8221; and &#8220;drawn,&#8221; which, I suppose,
are equivalent to &#8220;jerked&#8221; and &#8220;swung.&#8221;</p>

<p>Some writers having given directions for one
variety of the swing and some for the other;
their instructions at first sight appear so extraordinarily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
contradictory that I am almost afraid
of confessing that I agree with them all, lest
the reader who knows something about ski-ing
should set me down as an amiable idiot. As
soon, however, as one understands the cause of
it, this contradictoriness is seen to be more
apparent than actual. The difficulty in realising
the existence of these variations of the swing is,
no doubt, due to the fact that between the pure
&#8220;jerked&#8221; Christiania at one end of the scale,
and the pure &#8220;swung,&#8221; &#8220;steered,&#8221; &#8220;drawn,&#8221; or
whatever one likes to call it, Christiania at the
other, there are an infinite number of gradations,
one of them being a form of the swing that is
often seen, in which the turn is started by a
slight jerk <em>and</em> a slight separation of the ski-points,
and is carried through by the weighting
of the heels.</p>

<p>When one is running <em>across</em> the hill an uphill
Christiania of any kind can be made with perfect
ease on any sort of snow short of breakable
crust; when one is running <em>straight downhill</em> it
is less easy, if the snow is very loose and deep;
while to make a downhill turn in deep loose
snow by means of a Christiania is decidedly
difficult, especially if the slope is steep, though
on hard snow and a moderate slope this downhill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
turn is easy enough and safer than a stemming
turn, if the speed is at all high.</p>

<p>But although at first, when out on a run, you
will be wise if you only use the Christiania for
making uphill turns, and that on snow which
is easy for it, you should when practising keep
on trying it in deeper and deeper loose snow,
and should turn downhill as well as uphill, not
being satisfied until you can make fairly short
downhill turns in deep loose snow on a really
steep slope, as it is perfectly possible to do.</p>

<p>As in the case of the Telemark, the beginner
can of course learn to make an uphill &#8220;steered&#8221;
Christiania from a standstill by holding himself
back with his sticks while he places the skis in
the divergent position, and then letting himself
go and swinging round immediately. This is in
fact a very good way for him to begin to learn
it, for he can thus find out in a very short time
exactly how to hold his skis and distribute his
weight; nor need he be afraid of contracting any
bad habit by learning the swing in this way, for
though he may find it rather easier to learn the
Telemark by making it clumsily at first, he will
find nothing of the sort in the case of the
Christiania.</p>

<p>Before leaving the subject of the swings, let me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
impress upon the reader that in every swing or
turn the runner at first <em>starts</em> the side-slip by
stemming or steering with one ski held at an
angle with the other or by moving both with
a jerk&mdash;in short, by a <em>muscular effort</em>, however
slight a one&mdash;and that having started the side-slip
he lets his weight do the rest, and is carried
round without any effort at all. It is the effortless
side-slipping that gives a well-made swing
its characteristic feeling and appearance.</p>

<p>The whole difference between a novice&#8217;s turn and
an expert&#8217;s is that in the former&#8217;s the preparatory
stemming or steering preponderates, in the latter&#8217;s
the finishing side-slip; and that, moreover, in the
novice&#8217;s swing the initial and final movements are
seen (and felt) to be distinct and separate, while
in the expert&#8217;s swing the preparatory movement
merges imperceptibly into the final side-slip.
The more the preparatory steering, stemming, or
jerking is eliminated, the more comfortable&mdash;I
will not say the easier&mdash;is the swing, and the
steadier the balance if the swing is made at high
speed.</p>

<p>In the preparatory stemming or steering the
weight is for a moment more equally distributed
on both skis than I have intended the beginner
to suspect from the previous directions. Even in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
the Telemark, in which the weight is apparently
entirely on the leading ski both before and
throughout the swing, it is actually, at the
moment the front ski is turned inwards, half
supported by the back one. The same thing
happens at the moment the skis are made to
diverge in starting a &#8220;steered&#8221; Christiania. But
if the beginner makes any conscious effort to put
the weight back&mdash;unless, indeed, he tries to keep
it well forward&mdash;he will almost inevitably put it
<em>entirely</em> on the back ski, and in moving it on to
the leading ski as the swing proceeds will find
that his balance is liable to be disturbed. The
fact that the weight is always farther back than
he imagines is one which the beginner must
continually remind himself. In every uphill turn
the weight, which is at first, as I have just said,
about equally on both skis, is almost immediately
moved to the <em>heel</em> of the front foot&mdash;that is, it is
thrown <em>forward</em>, and as the swing finishes it is
thrown still <em>more</em> forward to prevent the ski from
turning too far uphill. In the directions for the
swings, therefore, the beginner should remember
that to weight first the heel and then the toe
does <em>not</em>, as a rule, mean to throw the weight first
backwards and then forwards, but to throw it
first <em>forwards</em> and then <em>still more forwards</em>.</p>

ski; left ski about 18 inches to the rear, pointed
slightly away from the other, and <em>flat</em>.</p>

<p>This position starts the swing; as it proceeds
press the left ski smartly inwards and forwards,
so that it returns as soon as possible to the
normal position again, parallel to and touching
the right ski. As it does so, <em>but not before</em>, it
may be edged and receive half the weight;
unless parallel with the other, it must be
<em>absolutely flat</em> and almost unweighted.</p>

<p>Fix your eyes on the point of the right ski and
try to lean in that direction only, not inwards.</p>

<p><em>N.B.</em>&mdash;A downhill turn is made in the same
way, except that to <em>start</em> the swing the <em>toes</em> of
both feet must be weighted for a moment.</p>

<p>2. (&#8220;Jerked&#8221;) for hard snow, or shallow
loose snow.</p>

<p><em>Preparation.</em>&mdash;Press both knees and skis
together and (except before a downhill turn)
edge the latter slightly to the right; weight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>on both and well forwards; knees rather bent,
feet level, or the right a little ahead.</p>

<p><em>Turn.</em>&mdash;(1) Still stooping slightly, move arms,
shoulders, and upper body&mdash;not the head&mdash;well
round to the right with an easy but decided
swing. (2) Without the least pause simultaneously
reverse the twist of the body, make a
vigorous stroke to the <em>left</em> with the arms, and
jerk hips and knees round to the <em>right</em>. The
movement of (1) should be gradual, of (2) sudden,
but the force about the same in each. The skis
should whip round to right angles, or nearly so,
with their previous course.</p>

<p>If you can make the stemming turn and the
Telemark and Christiania swings, you will, under
most ordinary conditions of snow, be able to turn
or stop with ease under any circumstances.
Sometimes, however, you will encounter snow,
the surface of which is covered by a crust, not
thick enough to bear the runner&#8217;s weight without
breaking, but sufficiently so to make it impossible
for him to shear round through it even
with a Telemark swing (for when the skis cut
into a thick crust they will only run in a
straight line).</p>

<p>Under these circumstances the only neat and
quick way of turning or stopping is to do so by
means of a jump which places the skis more or
less broadside on to their original course, and this
is not such a difficult matter as perhaps it sounds.</p>

<p>This jump is made with the feet level, and the
skis close together and parallel, in just the same
way as a jump used for starting on the side of a
hill or as a substitute for the kick-turn. Pay
the same attention to the points of getting the
weight well on the toes before making the spring,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>and of then crouching low and jumping with
a free, swinging action, not a timid, jerky one,
and <em>be sure to press the knees together</em>.</p>

<p>The skis should remain about parallel with the
surface of the snow throughout the jump; if the
jump is used for making an uphill turn, the points
of the skis must be well lifted, if for a downhill
one, their heels.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a id="fig42"></a><img src="images/fig42.jpg" width="400" height="366" alt="Figure 42" title="Figure 42" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 42.</span></p>
</div>

<p>You will find it far easier to keep your balance
on landing, if you remember <em>not</em> to jump to <em>one
side</em> of your course (<a href="#fig42">Fig. 42</a>, <span class="smcap">a</span>), but to come to the
ground with your feet as nearly as possible <em>on</em>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>your original line of progress&mdash;though, of course,
pointing across it, instead of along it, and,
according to the speed at which you were
running, more or less ahead of the place where
you took off (<a href="#fig42">Fig. 42</a>, <span class="smcap">b</span>).</p>

<p>The secret of using the jump round successfully
lies, not in the actual making of the jump,
but in knowing the safest and most effective way
of applying it.</p>

<p>Suppose, for instance, you are running either
across a slope or straight down it, at a very
moderate speed, and wish to stop, you can easily
do so by means of a jump round towards the hill,
which will bring you almost or quite at right
angles to your original course (Plates <a href="#plate47">XLVII.</a>
and <a href="#plate48">XLVIII.</a>). As you land you will naturally
have to lean inwards to compensate for the outward
throw. The amount of inward lean necessary
varies with the speed at which you are running
before the jump. When the speed is at all high
the inclination at which you would be safe from
an outward fall is so great that on landing after
the jump, if you were to make one, the skis would
almost certainly skid, and you would fall inwards;
while, if the skis did happen to hold, your legs
would not have enough strength to withstand
the shock, but would collapse under you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>When running at all fast, therefore, it is impossible
to stop with one jump. You must first
jump a little way round, so that you face less
directly downhill, and check your pace; you can
then jump again and stop yourself (<a href="#fig42">Fig. 42</a>, <span class="smcap">c</span>).</p>

<p>In the same way, if you wish to jump round
instead of making a downhill turn, you must
either make your tacks at a gradient which will
keep down your speed sufficiently to allow you
to make the complete turn in one jump, or you
must check your pace before making the downhill
jump by turning slightly uphill with a
preliminary jump. This is exactly equivalent to
checking the pace by making a slight uphill
swing before making a downhill one.</p>

<p>The higher the speed, the slighter the change
of direction that one can safely make in one jump,
and at a very high speed it would, for this
reason, be impossible to stop even in two jumps.
There is nothing to prevent a runner from
stopping or making a downhill turn at the
highest possible speed by means of a series of
jumps, but a turn so made covers so much ground
that it is practically useless. This does not much
matter, however, for the kind of snow which
makes jumping round necessary is not such as to
tempt one to run very fast.</p>

<h3><a name="SKATING" id="SKATING"></a>SKATING</h3>


<p>It is possible on a gentle slope, if the snow is
shallow, to use the skis like skates, striking out
with each alternately.</p>

<p>This needs little explanation. You have merely,
while running straight downhill, to lift one ski&mdash;say,
the right&mdash;and put it down again pointing
outwards from the other at a widish angle, their
heels being close together.</p>

<p>The moment the right ski touches the snow,
give a vigorous push backwards and to the left
with the left ski, at the same time throwing the
weight of the body well forwards and to the right
over the right foot. While sliding on the right
ski, bring the left forward and hold it close to
the other, but clear of the snow. You are then
ready to make a fresh stroke by putting down
the left ski and pushing with the right.</p>

<p>A series of such movements leaves a track
as in <a href="#fig43">Fig. 43</a>, <span class="smcap">a</span>.</p>

<p>You will find it difficult at first to throw the
weight sufficiently forward and outward at each
stroke, especially if, instead of putting down the
ski on which you are about to slide exactly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
level with the other, as you should do (<a href="#fig43">Fig. 43</a>, <span class="smcap">b</span>),
you put it farther forward (<span class="smcap">c</span>). This difficulty
will cause each stroke to become shorter and
shorter until it is impossible
to continue the
movement.</p>

<div class="figright">
<a id="fig43"></a><img src="images/fig43.jpg" width="150" height="300" alt="Figure 43" title="Figure 43" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 43.</span></p>
</div>

<p>In practising, hold the
ski which is off the snow
parallel with and close to
the other one until you
are ready to make the
next stroke, and slide on
each foot at least far
enough to make sure that
your balance is perfectly
steady on it.</p>

<p>It has already been explained
how, by striking
out to one side only, one
can change one&#8217;s direction&mdash;for,
of course, the action of stepping round is
precisely the same as that of skating&mdash;and how
one can in this way steer or stop oneself in
breakable crust.</p>

<p>Skating, moreover, is one of the best possible
exercises for the balance, for it teaches one to
run steadily on one foot without the support<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
of the other, and on this account alone you
should by no means omit to learn it.</p>

<p>It is generally supposed that by skating down
a gentle slope it is possible to increase the speed,
but I think this is very doubtful.</p>

<p>A skating track is a zigzag one, and is therefore
not such a short way over a given distance as a
direct slide. Then, again, although each stroke
tends to increase the speed, it must be remembered
that the whole weight of the runner rests on one
ski, causing it to sink deeper and travel slower,
and also that the skis are travelling slightly
across the slope instead of straight down it, which
reduces the speed still more. Besides this, the
stroke itself is not directly in the line of motion,
since it is impossible to place one ski at right
angles with the other one.</p>

<p>A better way of increasing the speed downhill
is probably to lunge <em>directly</em> downhill with each
foot alternately, keeping the skis close together&mdash;an
exactly similar action to that of moving on
level ground. Pushing with the sticks will, of
course, make you go faster still.</p>

<h2><a name="JUMPING" id="JUMPING"></a>JUMPING</h2>


<p>Ski-jumping no doubt arose from the discovery
that a slight inequality of the surface would
sometimes cause a ski-runner moving fast downhill
to leave the ground involuntarily for a
moment. Some abnormal person having liked
the feeling and wanted more of it, it is easy
to see how his endeavour to accentuate the
inequality, and so lengthen the jump, would
lead him to construct a horizontal platform
projecting from the hillside.</p>

<p>A competition jumping-hill at the present day
is chosen, as to shape, and so arranged that the
jumps may be as long as possible and the
jumper may have a minimum of difficulty in
keeping his feet on landing.</p>

<p><a href="#fig44">Fig. 44</a> shows the usual form of the hill and
position of the platform. (See <a href="#frontispiece">Frontispiece</a>.)</p>

<p>The jumper starts at <span class="smcap">a</span> and runs off the edge
of the platform <span class="smcap">b</span> into the air; landing on the
slope below at <span class="smcap">c</span>, he runs down it and out on the
level, where he swings to a standstill at <span class="smcap">d</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>The gradient of the hill above the platform is
preferably not more than 20° or so, for the jumper
must above all things
be perfectly steady
as he leaves the platform,
and if the upper
part of the hill is
very steep the sudden
change of gradient as
he runs on to the
platform is likely to
upset his balance.
The impetus can
therefore be obtained
more safely from a
long run at a moderate
gradient than
from a short steep
one.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<a id="fig44"></a><img src="images/fig44.jpg" width="400" height="199" alt="Figure 44" title="Figure 44" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 44.</span></p>
</div>

<p>The steeper the
slope below the platform,
other things
being equal, the longer obviously will the jump
be, and also the less will be the shock to the
jumper as he lands, on account of the narrower
angle between the ground and his course through
the air. For this reason a steep gradient below the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
platform is an advantage, and on big jumping-hills
the angle of this part of the slope is from 25° to 35°.</p>

<p>The dotted line in the diagram shows how, if
the platform were placed just at the point where
the slope becomes steeper, the length of the
jump would be greater than if, as is usually
the case, the platform were built farther back;
at the same time, however, the shock to the
jumper on landing would be increased also, for
his course through the air the moment before
alighting would then be more directly downwards,
and when in the air he would, at his
highest point, be farther from the ground.</p>

<p>This is one reason why the platform is usually
placed farther back. There is sometimes another
reason. The gradient must remain the same
for a sufficient distance below the point where
the jumper lands to enable him to get a steady
balance on landing, and unless the steep part
of the slope is very long, it may only be possible
by putting the platform farther back to
ensure that the jumper shall not land too near
the bottom of the hill.</p>

<p>For the same reason (of making things easier
for the jumper) the change of angle between
the top part of the hill and the platform,
and also between the lower part and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
level outrun, should take place as gradually as
possible.</p>

<p>The preceding description shows what form
of hill is most desirable, and is always chosen
for competition purposes where big jumps are
to be made. It is by no means on a hill of
this shape alone that a jump can be made;
and for learning, when you will only jump a
short distance, almost any hill will do, provided
the ground be fairly smooth and the slope
below the platform and the level outrun beyond
it be long enough.</p>

<p>If the shape of the hill in section is convex,
as in the diagram, the best place for the platform,
as already explained, is at or near the
point where the angle changes, <em>provided always
that the steeper part of the hill is fully ten
yards longer than the longest jump you will
make</em>. If it is a little less than this, build the
platform farther back; if much less, choose a
slope where there is no change of gradient.</p>

<p>The slope below the platform, or, at any rate,
all of it except the part which the jumper would
be certain to clear, must be free from irregularities,
have a good covering of snow (at least
a foot <em>when beaten down</em>), and fall at a steady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
gradient of not less than 20° for choice&mdash;if
possible of more.</p>

<p>The platform itself may be built in different
ways; the high platforms used in competitions
are generally built of planks supported at the
outer corners by posts.</p>

<p>This is unnecessary in the case of a low
platform, such as you will use at first.</p>

<p>A simple way of making it, if the materials
are handy, is to lay two or three planks on
top of an old packing case, and then to shovel
snow over them. Another way is to stand
two short sticks upright in the snow at the
same level, and a yard or so apart, according
to the intended width of the platform. Stack
fir branches against them on the uphill side,
and then build a platform of snow, or alternately
snow and branches, piling it high enough
to rise well above the tops of the upright sticks.
Beat it down with the spade and stamp it with
the skis until it is quite solid.</p>

<p>For learning, the platform should at first be
quite low&mdash;not much more than a foot high at
its front edge.</p>

<p>For big competitions, the platform is generally
6 or 8 feet high, or even more, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
Huitfeldt, a Norwegian authority, says it should
hardly exceed 3 feet.</p>

<p>Raising the platform, while increasing the
length of the jump, also increases the shock of
landing, and therefore the difficulty of the jump.
This difficulty, however, depends far less on the
<em>height</em> of the platform (which may, so to speak,
be merely a negative quantity, for of course it
is possible to make the platform <em>look</em> high by
cutting away the hillside below it without
affecting the nature of the jump) than upon
the <em>difference between the angle of its surface and
that of the slope below</em>, the most difficult kind of
platform to jump from being that called by the
Norwegians a &#8220;Spraet Hop&#8221; (squirt jump),
which is higher at its front edge than where it
joins the hillside. At first, therefore, make the
platform at almost the same angle as the slope
below, and join it gradually to the slope above,
so that there is no sudden change of gradient.</p>

<p>The length of the jump depends not only on
the height, position, and angle of the platform
<em>in relation to the slope</em>, but also on its <em>absolute</em>
angle in space. Other things being equal, a
platform sloping <em>downwards</em> at an angle of
between five and ten degrees permits the longest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
jumps. It would be easy to find by experiment
exactly the most favourable angle, and, for all I
know, this may already have been done.</p>

<p>The platform&#8217;s width, for practice, need be
no more than a yard: for competitions, when
the jumper may wish to take a fresh track, it
is about 4 yards.</p>

<p>Its length of course depends on its height, and
on the angle that it makes with the slope
above it. Roughly speaking, for a small jump
the platform would be 2 or 3 yards long; for
a big competition one at least 6 yards.</p>

<p>The top of the platform must, of course, be
horizontal in transverse section; take care to
build it up well at the sides in order to prevent
any convexity in the middle which might
cause the jumper to side-slip while taking off.
Carefully stamp down the snow not only on
the platform, but also up the track above it
for 10 or 15 yards from the platform&#8217;s edge.</p>

<p>This stamping should leave the snow as firm
and smooth as possible, but on the surface
there should be just enough loose snow to give
steerage way and prevent side-slip. Stamping
with the <em>edges</em> of the skis on the hard trodden
snow will generally loosen the surface sufficiently,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
otherwise it will be necessary to sprinkle loose
snow over it, or to scratch it with a rake.
According to Huitfeldt, the Telemarkings pile
up the snow at the edge of the platform so
as to form a shallow ridge. He says that by
waiting until they feel the fronts of their skis
touch this, they know when to make their
spring, and that it helps the forward tilt of
the body which is necessary. The latter seems
quite likely, but a man who timed his spring
in this way when running fast would hardly
even begin it before leaving the platform, far
less finish making it, as he actually ought
to do.</p>

<p>The same preparation of the track is necessary
below the platform from the nearest point
to it at which the jumper could possibly land
to a point several yards below the longest possible
jump. Pay particular attention here to
stamping down the snow until it is absolutely
firm, and make this trodden track a good deal
wider than the platform, to avoid any possibility
of the jumper landing outside it, for if
the skis sink deeply into the snow on landing,
a very bad fall may be the result.</p>

<p>After each jump snow should be thrown into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
any holes made in the track by the jumper
himself or his skis, and should then be stamped
firm and smooth; any natural hollows likely
to upset the jumper can also be filled up in
the same way. If, in order to prevent side-slip,
it is necessary to sprinkle the track with
loose snow of a different quality to that on
the track itself, it must be thrown over the
whole track; for a small patch of new sticky
snow, or of old and fast granular snow, would
suddenly alter the runner&#8217;s speed and disturb
his balance.</p>

<p>It is better to stamp down too much of the
track than too little, for a fall on hard snow
is quite harmless, if the slope is steep enough,
while in soft snow it may easily be dangerous.
It is sometimes advisable to stamp down the
whole of the outrun to where the jumper swings
to a standstill.</p>

<p><em>Equipment.</em>&mdash;Skis for jumping should be long,
strong, and fairly heavy, and <em>must</em> be grooved
underneath. They should be but little arched,
and should not be flexible, otherwise the shock of
landing after a big jump will make them bend
downwards in the middle so much as to check
the pace and pitch the jumper forwards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>Wax or polish their under surfaces as much
as you like; they cannot be too slippery for
jumping.</p>

<p>Only those bindings are suitable for jumping
by means of which the heel end of the ski can
easily be drawn up close to the foot when that
is held clear of the ground.</p>

<p>To carry a stick while jumping is useless, and,
except for an expert on an easy jump, is exceedingly
dangerous.</p>

<p><em>How to Jump.</em>&mdash;Stand far enough up the
track to get up a moderate speed, and not less
than 15 yards from the edge of the platform.
By no means risk running off the platform so
slowly that your skis simply tip over the edge
and bury their points in the snow.</p>

<p>Clean your skis and start off in any way you
like. If the start is on the side of the hill, and
not on a level place, the jumper often thrusts
his sticks into the snow on each side of the
track, and stands a little above them, facing
straight downhill, holding himself back by
resting his weight on them. He can then, by
merely letting go the sticks, start quite steadily
without altering the position of his skis.</p>

<p>Run in normal position until about 15 yards
before the edge of the platform; then bring the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
feet level, and crouch down until you reach the
position of <a href="#plate52">Plate LII.</a></p>

<p>Take care that the <em>knees</em> as well as the feet
are pressed tightly together, that the weight
is well forward, and that the hands hang as low
as possible, <em>i.e.</em> with the finger-tips level with
the ankles. Unless you pay particular attention
to this last point, and try to get as low
as you possibly can, it is probable that your
position, while feeling to yourself a decided
crouch, will only appear to a spectator as a
rather half-hearted stoop at the knees and hips.</p>

<p>When this low crouch has become mechanical,
you had better hold your arms backwards in a
horizontal position, but to touch your ankles
first is the best way of making sure that your
position is correct.</p>

<p>I believe that Norwegian authorities are not
agreed as to whether the feet should be held
level or in the normal position at this stage.
Huitfeldt, for instance, whom I have already
quoted, says that the Telemarkings, who invented
jumping, always jump with the feet in
the normal position. However this may be,
most good jumpers take the level position, and
you can safely do the same, but be sure, as you
bring the feet level, that they do not get apart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p><em>The &#8220;Sats.&#8221;</em>&mdash;Take the above crouching position
soon enough to be running steadily in it
with every detail correct by the time you reach
the platform, for before you reach the edge of
this you must have your whole attention free
to be concentrated on the actual take off, or,
as the Norwegians call it, the &#8220;Sats.&#8221;</p>

<p>This movement, which, if timed properly, is
<em>completed</em> at the instant that the jumper&#8217;s feet
come to the edge of the platform, has two
objects&mdash;to increase the length of the jump,
and to bring the jumper&#8217;s body into a position
at right angles with the slope below at the
moment of landing.</p>

<p>The latter is the more important, for unless it
is effected, the jumper is of course bound to fall.</p>

<p>Now, if the surface of the platform were inclined
at the same angle as that part of the
slope below it on which the jumper lands, he
might run down to the platform and into the
air without ever moving from the normal position,
and though he would not increase the
length of his jump, he would have every chance
of keeping his feet on landing, for his body
would be at the correct angle (<a href="#fig45">Fig. 45</a>, <span class="smcap">a</span>).</p>

<p>But the platform itself, no matter how low
it may be, and no matter how steep the slope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
above it, is nearly always less steep than the
slope below it, often a good deal less. This, of
course, means that the jumper in making the
&#8220;Sats&#8221; must not only spring, but must throw
his body forward, or he will land as in <span class="smcap">b</span> and <span class="smcap">c</span>,
and fall instantly on his back.</p>

<p>It depends almost entirely on the angle of
the jumper&#8217;s body on landing as to whether he
shall fall or keep his balance, and that angle
depends absolutely on the way he makes the
&#8220;Sats.&#8221; Indeed, at the moment of leaving the
platform and completing the &#8220;Sats,&#8221; the jumper
usually is almost certain whether he will stand
or fall. It follows, then, that the correct execution
of the &#8220;Sats&#8221; is the most important part
of the jump. It is certainly the most difficult,
and I think you will find it much easier to overcome
its difficulty if you realise at the outset that
the necessary forward tilt may be effected in two
perfectly distinct ways.</p>

<p>The jumper may make the &#8220;Sats&#8221; either so
that he leaves the platform tilted at exactly
the angle at which he will land, or so that
he is at right angles to the platform when
leaving it and changes the angle of his body
by degrees during his flight through the air.
(See <a href="#fig46">Fig. 46</a>.)</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a id="fig46"></a><img src="images/fig46.jpg" width="500" height="287" alt="Figure 46" title="Figure 46" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 46.</span></p>
</div>

<p>These two methods are none the less distinct
for the fact that the &#8220;Sats,&#8221; as made by most
jumpers, is a combination of the two.</p>

<p>By using the first method you will be far more
certain of landing at the proper angle, but will
barely increase the length of your jump; by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
second you will be able to lengthen your jump
to the utmost possible extent, but will find it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
exceedingly difficult at first to regulate the
forward tilt accurately.</p>

<p>You had better, therefore, begin by practising
the first method only, and keep to that until
you can jump with accuracy and certainty, when
you can little by little exchange it for the second
one.</p>

<p>In order to make the &#8220;Sats&#8221; by the first
method, you have, from the crouching position
of the first pair of figures, merely to bring your
body and thighs into line with the legs from
the knees downwards; for in the crouching
position this lower part of the legs is already
inclined forward at about the angle at which
you will have to land.</p>

<p>In straightening up, therefore, be most careful
to keep your legs below the knees, and also your
feet, absolutely motionless.</p>

<p>When in the crouching position make sure that
your knees are forced forwards to their utmost
extent, then try to imagine that they are being
held immovably in this position, and that your
heels are fastened firmly down to the skis. This
will ensure your making the straightening movement
of the &#8220;Sats&#8221; from the knees upwards
only, and, if you bring your thighs and body
exactly into line with the motionless lower part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
of the legs, will also ensure your landing at about
the correct angle, or even slightly more forward,
which will not matter.</p>

<p>As you straighten up, swing your arms
forwards and upwards to help the movement,
which, when you are used to it, you must try to
make so smartly, and even violently, as to be
almost instantaneous.</p>

<p>The sensation, however, will be quite different
to that of an ordinary standing long jump, in
which the heels leave the ground as the jumper
crouches, and the spring is made from the toes.
In this form of the &#8220;Sats&#8221; it is very important
that some of the weight should remain on the
heels, which should not be allowed to rise from
the skis in the smallest degree. You will find
that any pressure on the toes and lifting of the
heels will, though it may seem unlikely, almost
certainly tend to make you finish the &#8220;Sats&#8221; in
an erect instead of an inclined position.</p>

<p>The accurate timing of the &#8220;Sats&#8221; is naturally
most important. If it is made too late and the
knees are still somewhat bent as the jumper
leaves the platform (see <a href="#plate53">Plate LIII.</a>), the completion
of the movement in the air will push the
skis below their natural line of flight, and
the jump will be shortened&mdash;not a very serious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
matter for the beginner. If, however, the
&#8220;Sats&#8221; be made too soon, and the jumper&#8217;s
weight comes on his skis again before they
have left the platform, he will have a nasty
fall forward. This need not trouble you, for
you are certain to find the greatest difficulty in
managing to make the &#8220;Sats&#8221; soon enough.</p>

<p>The more slowly you make the movement, the
sooner you will have to begin it, and the more
difficulty you will have in timing it accurately,
but at first if you try to make it quickly you
will probably not do it correctly. I strongly
advise you therefore to go through the slow and
careful practising stage, not on the jumping-hill
at all, but without skis, in your bedroom or anywhere
else. Practise this movement at any odd
moment; it will soon become mechanical, and if,
before you start jumping, you have learnt to
make this movement quickly and accurately,
you will have made things enormously easier
for yourself.</p>

<p>When practising the &#8220;Sats&#8221; without skis you
will, of course, find that, as your weight comes on
your feet again at the end of the straightening
movement, you will be in the act of falling
forwards. You can prevent doing so by making
a quick stride forward with one foot and dropping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
into the Telemark position; but don&#8217;t do this
until the last possible moment, first making
quite sure that you are perfectly straight from
head to heels and inclined at a sufficient angle.
See also that your feet are held quite parallel
and touching each other.</p>

<p>So much for the first method of making the
&#8220;Sats.&#8221; The second is as follows. From the
preparatory crouching position spring straight
into the air with a free, swinging action, but
as strongly as possible, at the same time giving
the body a slight tilt forward, so that it becomes
more and more inclined during its flight through
the air. The spring is made from the toes this
time, but instead of the legs being drawn up as in
ordinary jumping, they should be quite straight
and in line with the body as they leave the
ground, and the feet should be pointed downwards,
exactly parallel and close together.</p>

<p>This movement (the arms are swung as before)
is much like that of a dive from a springboard;
but while the diver&#8217;s body has to make half a
revolution, or pass through an angle of 180°
during its flight through the air, the ski-jumper,
even in the case of the most exaggerated &#8220;squirt
jump&#8221; on the steepest hill, could hardly have
to change his angle by more than 45°. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
ski-jumper then would seem to have the easier
task.</p>

<p>The difficulty is that, whereas the diver wants
to land (?) head first, the ski-jumper would rather
not, and instinctively shrinks from the slight
effort in that direction which is necessary.</p>

<p>The remarks in the description of the first
method as to timing, &amp;c., hold good here, and
it is equally possible and advisable in this case
to practise without skis. When doing so you
should, after your spring into the air, land on
the ground on tip-toe, tilted as much forward
as possible, with your feet just where they
left the ground, and absolutely parallel to and
touching each other. A fall is avoided as before
by dropping into the Telemark position.</p>

<p>When the &#8220;Sats&#8221; is made very suddenly
and energetically in this way, the jumper may
notice a tendency not merely to give an insufficient
forward tilt to his body as he springs, but
even to tilt it slightly backwards, so that he
lands on his back with his skis in the air;
and this in spite of the fact that he may
quite have overcome his nervousness and desire
to shrink back.</p>

<p>I think it may be worth while to explain
this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>A man in making a standing jump, or a dive,
raises his heels and throws his weight on his
toes <em>as he crouches</em> for the spring, <em>i.e.</em> <em>before</em> he
begins the upward movement of the spring
itself. In this way his centre of gravity is
brought exactly above the point from which
he will push off.</p>

<p>A ski-jumper as he crouches for the spring
keeps his foot flat on the ski and his centre of
gravity over the middle of his foot, instead of
over the toes. If, then, from this position he
suddenly springs directly upwards, the final
pressure of the toes, which are farther forward
than his centre of gravity, will tend to tilt him
backwards. To avoid this tendency, try, in the
crouching position, to keep your weight as far
forward as possible (not, however, raising the
heels, which would make you too unsteady) and
make your spring slightly forwards as well as
upwards. When practising, without skis, either
method of making the &#8220;Sats,&#8221; always start
the movement from the crouching position of
<a href="#plate52">Plate LII.</a>, and be sure that it is correct in
every detail before you make the spring.</p>

<p>Remember that it is impossible to increase the
length of a jump on skis by springing forward
as you would for a standing long jump, for you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
can, of course, get no purchase for the backward
push. Even in the first method of making the
&#8220;Sats,&#8221; although the body should shoot forwards,
the push of the feet is almost entirely
downwards. The &#8220;Sats,&#8221; in fact, when it is a
jump at all, is a high jump only. Any pronounced
attempt to make it a long jump will
result in a fall.</p>

<p><em>Position in the Air</em> (<a href="#plate50">Plate L.</a>, &amp;c.).&mdash;Having
completed the movement of the &#8220;Sats,&#8221; do not
alter the position of your body and legs, but
hold yourself perfectly erect during your flight
through the air, your feet and skis being perfectly
level (<em>i.e.</em> neither ahead of the other), close
together, and exactly parallel. The skis must as
soon as possible be brought parallel to the slope
below you, and therefore your feet must be
pointed downwards, if they are not so already,
and the toes must be pressed down to prevent
the heels of the skis from dropping, as they are
very apt to do.</p>

<p>A jumper when in the air generally swings his
arms round and round. Now the dog cannot wag
its tail much without the tail wagging its dog
a little, and as the jumper is moving freely
through space his shoulder-muscles cannot swing
his arms round in one direction without at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
same time swinging him&mdash;<em>i.e.</em> his body and legs
as a whole&mdash;round in the other, though the
movement of his body and legs will be much
slower, as their mass is much greater, than that
of the arms.</p>

<p>If, then, he is not tilted far enough forward, the
jumper can, by swinging his arms in a forward-upward-backward-downward
direction, make the
rest of himself revolve slowly in the opposite
direction on the axis of his shoulder-joints, and
so tilt himself gradually forward; or, if his
forward tilt is too great&mdash;which is not very
likely&mdash;he can reduce it by swinging his arms
round the other way.</p>

<p><em>Landing.</em>&mdash;You should land in the above
position, with the feet level, close together, and
pointed well down, so that the skis strike the
ground with their whole surface simultaneously,
not with their heels first. Although the legs
should be kept straight during most of the flight
through the air, they should be bent slightly
just <em>before</em> you touch the snow.</p>

<p>In bending them <em>be sure to press the knees together</em>,
for to do so will ensure that, on landing,
the skis are level, close together, and parallel;
and also, which is equally important, that they
strike the snow flat, and not edged slightly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
outwards, as they are apt to do if the feet only
are held together.</p>

<p>This bringing together of the knees is therefore
the greatest help to landing steadily, and if
you remember to do it you need not think about
bending the legs, for when his knees are touching
and his feet parallel it is impossible for a man
of normal build to keep his legs straight. I
strongly advise you to include this movement
in your practice of the &#8220;Sats&#8221; (2nd method)
without skis.</p>

<p>As you feel the ground, <em>but not before</em>, drop
smartly into Telemark position, with the weight
well forward. This helps to diminish the shock,
and also, of course, the chance of a fall backwards
or forwards. It is such a help to the balance
that when you have got into the habit of it,
you will be inclined to begin the forward stride
in the air. Be careful to avoid doing so, for,
if you do, you may strike the snow with one
ski sooner than with the other, which will very
likely upset you. There is the same danger
if you land with your skis apart instead of
close together.</p>

<p>As the skis strike the snow, they bend in
the middle and each makes a depression in the
snow. From the deepest part of the hindmost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
of these depressions to the edge of the platform
is the measure of the jump. The record stands
at present at 47 metres (154 feet); you will do
well if you jump a tenth of this distance without
falling by the end of your first day&#8217;s practice.</p>

<p>As you drop into the Telemark position, keep
the ankles and knees well inwards and let the
pressure be rather on the inside of the foot, or
your skis may run apart and upset you.</p>

<p>Only run in Telemark position until you are
certain that you have your balance. You should,
if possible, make a merely momentary dip and
then straighten up smartly and finish your run
in the normal position, stopping yourself on the
level by a swing or a jump round as soon as
you can.</p>


<h4 style="font-weight: normal;"><span class="smcap">General Hints</span></h4>

<p>Ski-jumping to the ordinarily constituted
person who tries it for the first time is extremely
alarming. Although when the whole of the
hillside is of the same steepness he may from the
starting-point see something of the lower part
of the slope, the exact spot on which he will
land is nearly always hidden from the jumper
until just before he reaches the edge of the
platform, and even from that point it is still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
invisible if the platform is built back from the
edge of a steep slope. When the lower part
of the jumping-hill is steeper than the upper,
as it nearly always is, the platform, seen from
above, appears to be projecting over the edge
of a cliff.</p>

<p>This at first gives all but exceptionally bold
spirits an irresistible desire to shrink back on
approaching it, and it usually takes one some
time to overcome this desire, even after realising
that there is practically no danger at all.
Even when the jumper feels no fear his natural
disinclination to make his spring until he can
see where he is going to land will for some
time tend to make him defer the &#8220;Sats&#8221; until
too late.</p>

<p>The instinct to shrink back is, at any rate
at first, the principal difficulty in ski-jumping,
and I think you will find that the best way to
overcome it is, in a sense, to give way to it&mdash;that
is, to start under conditions which are as
little alarming as possible and to increase the
difficulty by very slow degrees.</p>

<p>Begin by making very short jumps on a quite
moderate slope, no steeper below than above the
platform, which must be quite low and long.</p>

<p>The fact of the slope being a gentle one does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
actually add to the difficulty of standing, but
only to a very slight extent if the platform
is quite low; and this form of hill is so much
the least alarming, that I advise you to choose
it for your first attempts.</p>

<p>Then make the same kind of jump on a fairly
steep slope.</p>

<p>Then build your platform, still quite low,
rather back from the edge of as steep a slope
as you can find, the slope above it being a
moderate one. Begin here with quite small
jumps, and gradually start farther and farther
back until you can make, with fair certainty
of standing, as long a jump as the form
of the hill and platform will permit; taking
care, of course, that the lower slope is of ample
length, <em>and that there is no sudden change of
angle where it joins the level</em>, for this causes
really bad falls.</p>

<p>After this you can make things more difficult
for yourself in various ways, such as increasing
the height of the platform, or building it at
the very edge of a steep slope instead of rather
back from it, or making it point upwards so as
to form a &#8220;squirt jump.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A squirt jump&#8221; on a moderate slope is excellent
practice. The considerable difference in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
angle between the platform and the alighting
ground makes it necessary for the learner to
throw himself well forward in making the &#8220;Sats,&#8221;
and the fact that he drops from a good height
on to comparatively flat ground makes the shock
sufficient to compel him to bend his knees and
take the Telemark position on landing. Only
jumps of a few yards should be made in this way,
however. The shock is too great for safety if
the drop is a really long one.</p>

<p>On no account allow yourself to forsake easy
hills for more difficult ones until on the former
you can make your jumps <em>in perfect style, correct
to the smallest detail</em>.</p>

<p>It is only by acquiring an absolutely perfect
style that you can make anything but the
smallest and easiest jumps with any certainty
of standing, and for this reason the only way
to gain confidence is to improve your style.</p>

<p>It may be a fine moral discipline to force
yourself over jumps of an alarming size from the
very first, but it will not make you a better
jumper; for if you are very nervous you will
be able to think of nothing until the jump is
finished, and so will learn nothing and have no
better prospect of standing at the twentieth
jump than at the first.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>After a course of this it is not unlikely that
the last state of your nerve will be worse than
the first.</p>

<p>It is a good thing to jump occasionally on
big hills almost from the first if you can do so
without feeling very nervous, but do not give
up small jumps until your style is perfect, otherwise
it never will be.</p>

<p>In Norway the style of the jump is considered
as important as, if not more so than, its length.
At a competition a jumper receives marks according
to the manner in which he performs
each stage of the jump&mdash;the approach, the
&#8220;Sats,&#8221; the flight through the air, the landing,
the rest of the run, and the swing at the
finish. Under certain circumstances even a fall
is not considered greatly to a jumper&#8217;s discredit.
If, for instance, a man makes a jump
in good style and is evidently steady on landing,
but, after running a few yards, loses his
balance on a bad bit of ground, he may score
higher than a man who jumps rather farther
and finishes without falling, but does so in very
bad style. I do not mean to say that merely
dribbling over the edge in a graceful attitude
is encouraged, for to jump as hard as possible is
part of good style, and to receive any consideration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
a jump must, as to length, be within
reasonable distance of the maximum allowed by
the form of the hill and platform.</p>

<p>Those who jump farthest, however, almost invariably
jump in the best style, and a very
long standing jump in really bad style is sure
to be a fluke; so that in rewarding the most
accurate jumpers the Norwegians probably
reward those who in the aggregate have jumped
the greatest distances, whatever their performance
on any single occasion may be.</p>

<p>I agree, however, with Mr. Richardson in
thinking that this system is likely to lead to
too much stress being laid on the purely ornamental
side of style, and that on the whole
it would be much better to consider only the
length of the jump and whether the jumper
stands or falls on landing. Always bearing in
mind, then, that it is only a means to the end
of jumping as far and of landing as steadily as
possible, do your utmost to improve your style,
watch for faults, and get other people to criticise
you as well. Check at the outset any tendency
to acquire any of the following bad habits:&mdash;</p>

<p>In the crouching position before the &#8220;Sats&#8221;:</p>

<p>Separating your feet or knees; only bending
slightly, instead of crouching quite low.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>In the &#8220;Sats&#8221;:</p>

<p>Making a feeble, timid effort, and not
straightening out completely, instead of springing
smartly and vigorously to an erect position,
with body and legs in a perfectly straight line.</p>

<p>In the air:</p>

<p>Bending at the hips or knees; separating the
skis, not keeping them parallel and in the same
plane; letting their heels drop; not keeping
the feet level; not bringing the knees together
before landing.</p>

<p>Landing:</p>

<p>Landing with the skis apart, or edged outwards,
or not parallel, or with one more ahead
than the other; letting their heels touch the
snow first; landing with straight legs (or very
bent ones); not dropping into Telemark position.</p>

<p>There is a method of jumping known in
Norway as the &#8220;traekke op,&#8221; in which, during
the flight through the air, the feet are drawn
up as close as possible to the body, which is
bent forward. This diminishes the resistance of
the air and perhaps slightly increases the length
of the jump, but is considerably more difficult
than the upright method, because it has a
greater tendency to make the jumper land
leaning backwards, or with the knees and feet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
separated so that the skis are pointed apart,
or with the legs so much bent that they are
liable to collapse from the shock.</p>

<p>In Norway this method is generally considered
less good style than the other.</p>

<p>If you wish to try it you had better make
the &#8220;Sats&#8221; in the ordinary way, straightening
out completely before you begin to draw up
the legs, and almost completely again before
landing. Be sure also, in lifting the feet, to
raise the toes well in order to avoid any risk
of plunging the points of your skis into the
snow on landing.</p>

<p>It is very good practice for the balance to
make jumps in this way when you cross small
undulations in the course of a run, or even
when the ground is quite smooth. You will
then, of course, have to draw up your feet the
moment you leave the ground. Be careful, by
holding your <em>knees</em> together, to keep your skis
from pointing outwards as you land.</p>

<p>An expert when running fast can in this
way jump a low fence or, to be precise, an
obstacle 2 feet or so high.</p>

<p>In spite of all that I have said about the
necessity for taking it gradually, and keeping
off big hills at first, you need not be afraid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
of hurting yourself much, no matter how far
you may jump, provided the hill and platform
be properly arranged, for in that case an accident
is almost impossible. You are far more likely to
meet with one when running at a comparatively
low speed on tour, if the snow is soft and
deep.</p>

<p>To be able to jump even moderately well will
enormously improve your running generally,
and will give you a confidence and dash that
can hardly be acquired in any other way.</p>

<p>It is an excellent plan for the beginner to
practise all the motions of jumping while running
down a slope, without any platform, and at first
without even a change of gradient. Make a
mark on the ground; run towards it, crouching;
make the &#8220;Sats&#8221; as you reach it, springing into
the air if possible; drop into Telemark position,
and straighten up again. Practise this until on
a slope where there is a slight change of gradient
you can make a jump of 3 or 4 yards steadily,
and you will find things come much easier when
you try from a platform.</p>

<p>Finally, let me remind you of the childish
plan that I have already advocated, of pretending
that you want to go faster than you
are actually moving. You can now pretend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
that you want to stay in the air as long as
possible&mdash;unless you really want to, which is
unlikely at first.</p>

<p>The man who wants to make a long jump
is much more likely to stand than the one who
merely wants not to fall.</p>

<p><em>Short Directions for the Jump.</em>&mdash;Run in
normal position until within about 15 yards of
the platform&#8217;s edge (not so close if running
very fast), then bring your feet level and,
<em>keeping your knees pressed together</em> and well
forwards, crouch down as low as possible. When
the hands can touch the ankles draw them
right back.</p>

<p>Just before reaching the edge of the platform
make the &#8220;Sats&#8221; by either of the following
methods:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Without raising the heels or moving the
feet or legs below the knees, swing your arms
forward and upward and straighten yourself
smartly until your body and thighs are in a
line with the lower part of the legs. You will
then, if you have moved from the knees only,
be leaning well forward.</p>

<p>2. Swinging the arms as before, spring
vigorously almost straight upwards from the
platform, giving the body a slight forward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
tilting motion as you do so, and straightening
out completely from head to foot, but this time
raising the heels and finishing the spring from
the toes.</p>

<p>On completing the &#8220;Sats,&#8221; hold the erect
position during the flight through the air,
keeping the feet level and close together and
the skis parallel to each other and to the slope
below.</p>

<p>Just before landing press the knees together,
and, as you feel your skis touch the snow, but
not until then, drop into Telemark position.</p>

<p>The moment you feel steady straighten up
again, finish your run in the normal position,
and swing or jump round.</p>

<h2><a name="HOW_TO_RUN_ACROSS_COUNTRY" id="HOW_TO_RUN_ACROSS_COUNTRY"></a>HOW TO RUN ACROSS COUNTRY</h2>


<p>As soon as you have acquired a moderate
proficiency in the various man&oelig;uvres that have
been described, you should have little difficulty
in getting through a run quickly and comfortably
without feeling any temptation to use your stick
when once the descent has begun.</p>

<p>The following hints may help you when you
go for an expedition:&mdash;</p>

<p>In the first place, be sure, especially if you are
going far, that you are taking everything you
can possibly want&mdash;spare clothing, food, dark
glasses, wax and rag, knife, sealskin, climbing-irons,
repair outfit, map, compass, lantern,
matches, &amp;c., if you decide that any or all of
these things are necessary.</p>

<p>If the first part of the climb is along a beaten
path, it will probably save time to cover that on
foot. You can then either drag the skis after
you by a string tied to the holes in their tips,
or can carry them. Most people eventually
prefer the latter method.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>The best way of carrying the skis is to place
them sole to sole (tie them so if you like), and
then either to rest them almost <em>horizontally</em> on
the shoulder, points forward, and hold them near
the bend, or to lean them nearly <em>upright</em> against
the shoulder, points up, and, with the arm
hanging almost straight, to hold them by the
heel ends (Plates <a href="#plate58">LVIII.</a> and <a href="#plate59">LIX.</a>).</p>

<p>They can also be carried by a sling from the
shoulder, a convenient plan if any scrambling is
to be done.</p>

<p>If you are climbing the hill by the route that
you mean to follow during the run down, you
should take every opportunity of making observations
which will be useful to you later on, and
will enable you to make the descent as quickly
and easily as possible.</p>

<p>Try to plan out exactly how you will take the
run down.</p>

<p>Notice all the peculiarities of the ground and
snow, and fix in your head the principal landmarks.
But remember that the ground will look
very different when approached from above, and
therefore keep on looking backwards at what
you have passed.</p>

<p>Pay particular attention to the points where
the angle of the slope changes, in order that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
when from above you are running towards an
invisible piece of steeper ground, you may have
the clearest possible idea of what to expect.</p>

<p>The actual climbing will at first give you a
good deal to think of.</p>

<p>The ordinary procedure, when several ski-runners
are climbing a hill, is for one to lead
and the rest to walk in his track in single
file.</p>

<p>If the snow is soft and deep the leader&#8217;s work
may be very exhausting, and each of the party
will have to take his turn.</p>

<p>If you are leading, make your tacks as long
as possible to avoid wasting time in kick-turns.
Remember all that has been said about adjusting
your course to the contour of the hill so that
you mount at a steady gradient which is too
steep for no one in the party, about not side-stepping
unnecessarily, and so on. And never, without good reason, attempt to hurry.</p>

<p>If you are not leading, and if the leader is
a competent person, you will not have much to
think of. If he is not, you may find following
him a tiresome business.</p>

<p>If it is really difficult to do so (not merely
irritating), don&#8217;t dream of suffering in silence,
but complain at once, and if he is so stupid or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
inconsiderate as to persist in his misdeeds, make
a new track for yourself.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t be at all disturbed if you find yourself
being left behind, but keep on steadily at your
own pace.</p>

<p>If you make a halt and take your skis off,
clean them thoroughly at once, and see that their
soles are neither wet nor warm when you put
them on again. If you are likely to feel cold
(and you <em>are</em> likely as a rule), put on spare
clothing as soon as you stop, not after you feel
chilly.</p>

<p>Wax your skis thoroughly before starting the
run down if the snow is sticky, or is likely to
be so lower down; and remember to button up
your pockets, or you may find at the bottom
of the hill that snow has either taken the
place of, or ruined their contents.</p>

<p>I have so far attempted no description of the
snow itself. It varies infinitely in consistency,
but considerably less so in appearance, and for
this reason it is often impossible for the runner
to be sure of the quality of the snow in front of
him until his skis actually touch it.</p>

<p>This latter fact adds considerably to the difficulty
of ski-running when patches of different
slipperiness occur at short intervals. The worst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
kind of patchy snow consists of a hard and
slippery ice-crust in the hollows of which finely
powdered wind-blown snow has accumulated;
fortunately in this case the difference is generally
visible, the slow powdery snow being perfectly
white and the ice-crust rather greyer. The
safest way of negotiating snow of this sort
while running straight has already been explained.</p>

<p>For practical purposes the ski-runner may
consider the snow to be of three distinct
varieties according to the consistency of its
surface: viz. soft snow, hard snow, and breakable
crust. There is no real division between
these varieties, each melting into the other
by imperceptible gradations; but, where the
quality of the snow falls clearly under one
of these headings, the runner will be obliged
to use certain definite methods of turning
and stopping, unless he is either a thorough
expert, or a stick-rider of the worst kind.
For, as I have already said, the former can make
any kind of swing in almost any kind of snow,
while the latter has only one method of turning,
viz. that of dragging himself to one side or the
other by means of his stick, carefully preserving
while he does so his normal running position, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
the knees well bent and the skis level, parallel,
and a yard or so apart, which man&oelig;uvre he calls
making a stemming curve or a Christiania swing,
according as the turn has been a downhill or
an uphill one.</p>

<p>Assuming, then, that you belong to neither
of these classes, you will have to know how
to adapt the means of turning to the quality
of the snow. It should be fairly obvious from
the descriptions of the different swings how
this is to be done.</p>

<p>In <em>deep</em> loose snow make all your turns,
whether downhill or uphill, by means of the
Telemark swing.</p>

<p>On hard snow, whether quite bare or covered
by a very shallow layer of loose snow, make
your downhill curves by means of the stemming
turn, and use the Christiania swing for
turning uphill.</p>

<p>In breakable crust, if it is very thin, you
may find it possible to turn or stop with the
Telemark. If this is out of the question you
will have to jump or step round.</p>

<p>Of course soft snow may be so dense that
the ski sinks into it but little (as in the case
of watery spring snow); you will find it just
as easy to make stemming turns and Christianias<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
in this as to make Telemarks&mdash;perhaps
even easier.</p>

<p>In the same way the layer of loose snow
on a crust may be deep enough to allow Telemarks
to be made as steadily as the other
turns.</p>

<p>A breakable crust, too, may be so thin as
to be hardly perceptible, or so thick that only
some extra pressure (which occurs when a
swing is made) will make it give way; but,
generally speaking, you will find that you are
limited to one method or the other&mdash;if you
want to run with the maximum of steadiness.</p>

<p>Evidently, then, the Telemark is at least as
generally useful as the other two turns to
the moderately skilful runner who does not
rely on the help of his stick. Yet most English
runners undoubtedly look upon it as a pretty
trick of no practical value, and never attempt
it during a run.</p>

<p>It is quite certain, however, that a man who
can make a Telemark swing with fair steadiness
on a hard and slippery practice-ground
(and the average runner can do this) will find
it far easier to do so in the soft loose snow
which is, fortunately, the variety most commonly
met with during a run.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>And if he can make the swing to the left,
he is certainly capable of learning to make it
to the right, and of turning downhill with it as
well as uphill.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a id="fig47"></a><img src="images/fig47.jpg" width="289" height="400" alt="Figure 47" title="Figure 47" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 47.</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">s</span>, Stemming Turn; <span class="smcap">t</span>, Telemark; <span class="smcap">c</span>, Christiania;
<span class="smcap">j</span>, Jump round.</p>
</div>

<p>But if the runner only learns the Telemark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
to the left and the Christiania to the right,
as most people are content to do, it will be
a long time before he can rely on them during
a run; for only the thorough expert can make
both these swings with steadiness and certainty
in any kind of snow, especially if his speed
be high or the slope steep.</p>

<p>With the Christiania in particular it is exceedingly
difficult, if the snow is unsuitable, to
make a downhill turn, and by no means easy
to make an uphill one.</p>

<p>The stemming turn, which is the only one
attempted during a run by the average runner
(I say &#8220;attempted&#8221; advisedly, for an examination
of his track will seldom reveal much trace of
actual stemming), is even more difficult to make
in unsuitable snow than the Christiania.</p>

<p>The most important thing for you to remember
when you first begin to make practical use of
the swings, &amp;c., while on a run, is that if you
wish to fall as little as possible, you should
<em>never attempt to turn or stop while running at
all fast</em>.</p>

<p>If you run with judgment you can always
avoid having to do this.</p>

<p>Suppose, for instance, that you find yourself
approaching the edge of a steep slope; if your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
course is clear and the slope has an easy outrun
on to level or nearly level ground, by all
means run straight down; for at the bottom
you will either run to a standstill or will
slow up enough to be able to turn easily if
necessary.</p>

<p>If, however, there is no clear outrun at the
bottom of the slope, or if there are obstacles in
your path, don&#8217;t dream of dashing straight over
the edge and trying to turn off lower down,
which you will certainly fail to do, but either
stem, snow-plough, or side-slip straight down the
slope, or turn off at once and take it in zigzags,
making a downhill turn at the end of each tack
by whatever method the quality of the snow demands.
And unless you run each tack at a very
gentle gradient indeed, you should take the further
precaution of slowing up by turning slightly
uphill before beginning each downhill turn.</p>

<p>To check the pace by making an uphill swing
is a much neater and easier way of doing it
than by stemming with the lower foot; the latter
is a process which, when the ground is open,
you need seldom use if you have a moderate
command of the swings, though among obstacles&mdash;in
dense wood and the like&mdash;you may often
find it necessary to have recourse to it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>The means you use for making this preliminary
uphill turn will depend, of course, on
the quality of the snow, just as in the case of
the downhill one.</p>

<p><a href="#fig47">Fig. 47</a> shows what turns to use in order
to run in zigzags through snow of the three
different qualities. The downhill turns should
be made as shortly and sharply as possible, in
order to prevent the pace from becoming unmanageable
in the middle of them.</p>

<p>If on account of the nature of the ground you
decide to run straight down a steep slope instead
of taking it in zigzags, you must, of course, be
ready to drop into Telemark position for any
sudden undulations or difficult snow.</p>

<p>Remember that the quality of the snow depends
to a great extent on the direction in
which the slope faces.</p>

<p>On slopes with a north aspect, especially if
they are steep, the snow gets little or no sun,
and is generally soft and easy, though even
here it may sometimes get crusted by very
strong winds or by frost after a warm wind or
rain.</p>

<p>On slopes which face south the snow is exposed
to the rays of the sun&mdash;more or less
directly according to the steepness of the slope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
and the time of year. During the day, therefore,
the surface of the snow melts, freezing at
night into a crust, and when the sun goes off
these south slopes they are, as a rule, perfectly
hard and icy, though when the sun is full
on them they may become so soft that you
will find it difficult to use any turn except the
Telemark.</p>

<p>The most difficult snow occurs on slopes
which face a little south of east or west, and
on due south slopes when the sun is just beginning
to strike them, or is going off them;
for then the hard crust generally becomes more
or less breakable.</p>

<p>If you get these facts about the snow well
into your head, it will be a great help to you
during a run.</p>

<p>You will very likely find that one kind of
turn comes easier than another, and at first,
when your principal object is to run steadily
and avoid falls as far as you can, your safest
plan will be to shape your course so as to make
most of your turns by the method that you find
easiest. If you thoroughly understand the conditions
which affect the quality of the snow,
you will know where to look for that kind of
snow which suits your favourite method of turning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
and what places to avoid for the probable
unsuitability of their surface.</p>

<p>Do not forget that what is true of the main
slopes is also true of their minor features. On
slopes facing east or west, for instance, each
small undulation has its north and south side,
the surface of which is affected by sun and
frost in just the same way as the main slopes
facing in that direction. If you remember this
you will often, when running across a slope
whose general surface is difficult, be able to find
small patches of snow on the sides of the undulations
in which you can turn quite easily.</p>

<p>When beginning the run down always make
up your mind before you start how you mean
to negotiate that part of the hill which is visible.
If some way ahead the ground becomes steeper,
so as to be invisible, and you do not know what
it is like, don&#8217;t run at a high speed to where
the slope changes, but approach it in zigzags,
or at any rate slowly, in case you should find
it necessary to turn off or stop at the edge of
the steeper slope. By doing this you will preclude
the possibility of dropping over a precipice
on unknown ground.</p>

<p>As soon as you can see what was hidden from
you, plan out, without stopping if possible, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
next visible piece of your course in the same
way.</p>

<p>There is one difficulty about steering among
obstacles which it may be as well to mention.</p>

<p>Suppose you are running down or across a
slope with a tree straight ahead of you which
you mean to avoid when fairly close to it, by
swinging, say, to the left.</p>

<p>As you already know, you must, at the beginning
of any turn, lean forwards, perhaps even a
little outwards, <em>never</em> inwards. Now, if there
were no tree in front of you, you would probably
have no difficulty whatever in making the turn,
but the fear of running into the tree will at
first be almost certain to make you lean away
from it as you begin the turn&mdash;that is, backwards
and to the left. You will then, if you
don&#8217;t fall down at once, at any rate fail to
turn sharply, and so will probably do exactly
what you were trying to avoid, viz. run into
the tree.</p>

<p>Àpropos of trees, let me remind you that turns
are mainly for <em>steering</em>, and that therefore, except
just at first, they should be practised <em>where steering
is necessary</em>&mdash;<em>i.e.</em> among trees or other obstacles.
Unless you take every opportunity of practising
them there, they will be of little real use to you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
You should soon be able to make downhill turns
on any <em>open</em> slope with ease, and will soon afterwards
cease to find much fun in doing so, but
there is no end to the difficulty and therefore the
interest of turning quickly among obstacles, and
anyone who is or wishes to be a good ski-er will
not be happy unless he gets plenty of wood-running.
Nor, for much the same reasons, will
he be contented without plenty of <em>bad and
difficult snow</em>, a fact which you should lay to
heart at the outset.</p>

<p>I have already said that when running fast on
ground that is covered with hard ski-tracks, you
should try to avoid crossing them at a narrow
angle. You will sometimes find that you want
to run a traverse on a slope closely covered with
hard parallel tracks, leading exactly the way you
want to go and steeply enough to make running
in them extremely unsteady. Your best plan
here is to run almost or quite directly downhill
across them for a short distance, and then to
turn upwards with a Christiania and make a
longish traverse at a less steep angle than the
tracks; your low speed then enabling you to
cross them at a narrow angle in safety. By
repeating this process you will reach the point
to which the tracks lead almost as quickly and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
far more comfortably than by following them.
To make alternate direct descents and gradual
traverses in this way is also convenient when
you would otherwise have to run a steep <em>stemming</em>
traverse.</p>

<p>By paying careful attention to all the above
points you should soon be able to run safely
and steadily, and to get down any ordinary
hill with few or no falls. This also means that
you will accomplish the descent in pretty quick
time, provided that you <em>never stop</em> if you can
possibly help it, and that after a fall you get
up without either hurrying or dawdling.</p>

<p>This kind of running makes no great demands
on your skill, and still less on your nerve. Its
main object is the avoidance of falls, and <em>at
first this should certainly be your sole aim</em>.
But if you wish to become a really good runner
you should not allow it to remain so for long.</p>

<p>The first-rate runner has absolute command
of the various swings, &amp;c., and can stop suddenly
or dodge among obstacles at a pretty high speed
with perfect steadiness (at very high speeds it is
impossible to turn or stop <em>suddenly</em>; the curve
of the swing is then bound to be more or less
long and gradual). He never turns or stops if
he can help it, however, but runs everything <em>as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
straight as he can</em>, and <em>at the highest possible
speed</em>.</p>

<p>There is not the least doubt that to take a
hill in this way not only demands the utmost
skill, but gives the greatest pleasure that ski-running,
pure and simple, can afford.</p>

<p>It is not unusual to hear a man who never
takes the easiest slope without constant zigzagging,
say that he does so because he <em>prefers</em>
going slowly and spinning out the run to dashing
down in a quarter of the time. He infers,
if he does not actually say, that the fear of
speed has nothing to do with his choice.</p>

<p>You may be nearly sure that the man who
talks in this way is inferring, if not telling, a
lie, though very likely unconsciously. I used
to say the same myself, and did not realise
for some time that every ski-runner, whatever
he may say or think, runs just as fast as he
dares.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t for a moment mean to say that there
is anything to be ashamed of in being afraid
of going fast. Indeed, the man who realises
and openly admits that he is afraid, and who
refuses to attempt anything which puts a great
strain on his nerve, is very likely a more reasonable
and admirable person than the one who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
gradually becomes a better runner simply through
being ashamed of admitting his cowardice even
to himself. I only want to impress upon you
that the <em>sine qua non</em> of fine ski-running is
<em>speed</em>, and that if you want to become a fine
runner, you must be always trying to take
things faster and faster. One reason why jumping
is such an excellent training for the ski-runner
is that it accustoms him to running at
the greatest possible speed, and to falling
occasionally while doing so.</p>

<p>To pay no particular attention to anything
but straight running and speed from the first
is of course absurd, for if you do this you will
fall about hopelessly when any steering is necessary,
and the most miserable stick-riding zigzagger
will be down a hill long before you.</p>

<p>First of all, practise all the turns until you
can make them with steadiness, for the special
purposes and on the particular snow to which
they are best adapted.</p>

<p>If you are weak in any turn, practise that
one especially, <em>not only on the practice-ground,
but during a run</em>.</p>

<p>To do the latter will, of course, add considerably
to the number of your falls during a run,
but it is the only way to improve, and you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
should never, except at the very outset, or
for some special reason, be too anxious not
to fall.</p>

<p>The boast of having accomplished a run without
a single fall is usually sufficient to stamp
the utterer of it as either a novice or a nervous
person, who has negotiated his whole run in the
easiest possible way. A very moderate runner, if
he chooses, can thus avoid falling easily enough;
but if he wishes to become a better one, he is
bound to take chances, where an unambitious
or timid one would play for safety.</p>

<p>Do not forget, however, that if to boast of not
falling lays you open to suspicion in one way, to
boast of <em>falling</em> stamps you infallibly in another.</p>

<p>After you can make all the turns pretty well
in the snow which is easiest for each, begin to
practise them in difficult snow. When you can
make them while running at a moderate speed,
try to do so at higher and higher speeds.</p>

<p>You can then practise running with the same
foot leading the whole time, and make only
Telemarks one way and Christianias the other;
if you find this easier with the right foot leading,
run always with the left foot leading until that
comes just as easy.</p>

<p>Do your utmost, in short, to improve your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
steering in every possible way, and then try to
run everything as straight and fast as ever
you can.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t, of course, mean that you are to become
a past master at swinging and turning before you
try to run straight and fast, for the two things
can be practised together. But steering must
come first, and until you can steer as well with
your long grooved ski and without the help of
the stick as the most redoubtable Lilienfeld
stick-rider with his short smooth skis, you must
give much more attention to that than to speed.</p>

<p>Your ultimate aim must, as I have already
said, be to run in the utmost safety, with the
utmost skill (<em>i.e.</em> with the least effort) and at the
utmost speed; but if ever, as in a race, speed is
almost your sole object, remember the following
facts:&mdash;</p>

<p>Apart from the question of obstacles, the
quickest way to get down a hill is of course to
run <em>freely</em> straight down it.</p>

<p>The <em>second</em> quickest way is a <em>free</em> direct
descent checked at intervals by uphill swings,
so that the speed never becomes high enough to
be difficult.</p>

<p>The <em>third</em> quickest way is a direct <em>stemming</em>
(Telemark, snow-plough, or side-slip) descent, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
not, as most people imagine, a <em>free</em> descent by
tacks and downhill turns. The latter method
takes more skill and less effort, but is a great
deal slower.</p>

<p>To sum up, let me advise you to take in succession
each of the following series of &#8220;Don&#8217;ts&#8221; as
your guiding maxim when learning cross-country
running:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) <em>Don&#8217;t fall</em> (but stem, kick-turn, and stop
<em>ad lib.</em>).</p>

<p>(2) <em>Don&#8217;t stop</em> (<em>i.e.</em> stem <em>ad lib.</em>, but make no
kick-turns).</p>

<p>(3) <em>Don&#8217;t stem</em> (but make as gradual tacks as
you like, and check the pace when necessary by
uphill swings).</p>

<p>(4) <em>Don&#8217;t slow up before turning downhill.</em></p>

<p>(5) <em>Don&#8217;t</em>&mdash;if you can safely avoid it&mdash;<em>turn at
all</em>.</p>

<p>When you can accomplish a run without <em>falling</em>
or <em>stopping</em>, you may consider yourself a
third-rate cross-country runner, being quite safe
and not too slow.</p>

<p>When you can do so without <em>falling</em>, <em>stopping</em>,
or <em>stemming</em>, your running will be sufficiently
safe, fast, and in particular <em>effortless</em>, to be called
second-rate.</p>

<p>When you can manage most of your run without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
either <em>falling</em>, <em>stopping</em>, <em>stemming</em>, or <em>turning</em>,
you may be quite pleased with yourself.</p>

<p>The last sentence suggests a further word of
advice.</p>

<p>It is seldom reasonable to feel very proud of
one&#8217;s running, but it is often the greatest help to
<em>pretend</em> to do so.</p>

<p>If after taking all possible pains to learn any
man&oelig;uvre you still find a difficulty in doing it,
try the effect of imagining yourself rather a
desperate fellow&mdash;a careless, skilful, dashing
person who has done this sort of thing all his
life and thinks nothing of it. You will very
likely find that this acts like a charm, and that
it was only the stiffness that comes from over-carefulness
which prevented you from succeeding
before. A certain amount of &#8220;side,&#8221; in fact&mdash;whether
natural or assumed&mdash;is really an excellent
thing. Most good performers <em>talk</em> of
their running&mdash;perhaps sincerely&mdash;with becoming
modesty, but they seldom show much sign of this
modesty in their <em>actions</em> when ski-ing&mdash;evincing,
as a rule, a healthy self-confidence which might
almost be mistaken for a desire to show off.</p>

<p>In the above series of &#8220;Don&#8217;ts&#8221; I have not
included &#8220;<em>Don&#8217;t use the stick</em>,&#8221; because I trust
it would never enter your head to do so. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
might however have said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t be afraid of
leaving your sticks at home,&#8221; for unless you want
to race uphill or on the level you can easily
dispense with them, and to do so occasionally
will prevent you from getting into the slovenly
habit of prodding with the inner stick at the end
of every swing. Not that this prodding need be
considered a very serious crime, for as long as
a stick is used with one hand for <em>pushing</em> and not
with both for <em>pulling</em>, no great harm will be done
to the style. But this prodding is a slight waste
of energy, and therefore the tendency to do it
should be checked. To go without a stick at all
occasionally is the best possible way to cultivate
a perfectly free and effortless style, not only of
running <em>down</em> a hill, but of climbing <em>up</em> it.</p>

<p>One sometimes hears the absurd statement that
to tour without a stick is &#8220;unnatural,&#8221; and
therefore not permissible. All ski-ing is &#8220;unnatural.&#8221;
If it is &#8220;natural&#8221; to carry a stick, it
is still more &#8220;natural&#8221; to lean on it hard the
whole time. The only real and searching test of
the <em>skill</em> and <em>ease</em> of a man&#8217;s running is to take
away his stick altogether and see if he can run
fast and steadily across any sort of country without
it; and I strongly advise you to test your
own running in this way from time to time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>It is a curious coincidence, if nothing more, that
in Canada it is the regular thing for ski-ers to do
their cross-country running without sticks, and
that in Canada, <em>and nowhere else</em>, an Anglo-Saxon
(Barney Reilly) has already done some
first-rate jumping.</p>

<p>About the special dangers of ski-running a
word or two may be useful. The risk of injury
from falling on snow is not very great, and there
is not much danger of any one but a lunatic
dropping over a precipice in an unknown country,
or dashing at full speed into a solid obstacle,
instead of adopting the simple device of falling
down before he reaches it, if he cannot manage
to turn. I have never heard of anything worse
than a broken leg (which is no doubt quite bad
enough) resulting from a fall in snow. The kind
of snow most likely to lead to injury is not hard,
icy snow, as the beginner generally fancies, but
deep soft snow, especially if covered by a
breakable crust; for in this the skis may plunge
beneath the surface, and, getting jammed, may
throw a strain on the foot or leg.</p>

<p>But even here the runner whose style is good
is not very likely to hurt himself, even when
going fast, if his binding fits properly; it is the
stick-rider with his feet level and skis apart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
who gets the most awkward falls. In jumping,
owing to the firmness of the surface, there is
hardly any danger at all.</p>

<p>The real danger of injury in ski-running does
not consist so much in the nature of the injury
itself as in the fact that it may leave the
runner incapable of movement in a dangerous
situation.</p>

<p>If he is far from shelter he may be badly
frost-bitten before he can be got home&mdash;therefore
the more spare clothing he carries the
better.</p>

<p>If he is alone, he will be lucky if he gets home
at all&mdash;and any one who thoroughly realises this
will think twice before he goes ski-ing by himself
without saying where he is going.</p>

<p>The advantage of carrying a map and compass,
and of knowing how to use them in case
of losing one&#8217;s way, is obvious. It is not only
the mountaineer but the ordinary tourist who
is exposed to this danger, for even the latter
should remember that when once he is above
the tree-line a snow-storm or a fog may make
it impossible for him to find his way for ten
yards by eye alone.</p>

<p>In thick snow or fog nothing is visible except
a blank whiteness. When the fog or falling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
snow are thin, objects which are darker than the
snow (rock, trees, &amp;c.) may be visible for some
distance, but all light and shade disappears in
the snow itself, all tracks, holes, and irregularities
in its surface become quite invisible, and
it is then impossible, in a bare tract of snow,
for the runner to tell whether the ground in
front of him goes downhill, uphill, or level.</p>

<p>Even an overcast sky causes this curious absence
of light and shade; and then, though the
main landmarks may be visible, and there may
be no danger of getting lost, running becomes
exceedingly difficult and uncomfortable, perhaps
even dangerous, for the snow on the edge of a
precipice or steep drop, when seen from above,
is apparently continuous with the snow at the
foot of it.</p>

<p>In the description of equipment I have already
mentioned the necessary safeguards against frost-bite
and snow blindness.</p>

<p>Anything more than an allusion to the danger
from avalanche is quite beyond the scope of this
book. It is an intricate subject, about which
whole books have been, and no doubt will yet
be, written.</p>

<p>I believe that even now the conditions which
produce winter avalanches are not fully understood.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
On any open slope of more than certain
steepness&mdash;23° or so&mdash;an avalanche may start,
especially after a thaw, or before the snow of a
recent fall has had time to settle down. An
avalanche, once started, can of course travel over
a less steep slope, or even level ground. Lose
no time in collecting all the information you
can on the subject; for, although the ordinary
tourist (not the climber) can usually avoid it,
the danger is a very serious one, and you should
never willingly expose yourself to the smallest
risk of it. If the risk is unavoidable, make sure
that you can get your skis off your feet in a
moment, for if you are caught in an avalanche
this is the first thing to do. The next is, if
possible, to keep your head above the surface
of the snow.</p>

<p>The ancient quip about presence of mind and
absence of body is particularly applicable in a
case of this sort.</p>

<p>I have said something about the special discomforts
and dangers of the mountains and the
snow, but nothing about their extraordinary
beauty and fascination. If I were better fitted
for the task than the ordinary guide-book writer,
I might attempt a description of them; as I am
not, I will spare the reader.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>To some ski-runners these beauties may be of
secondary importance to the sport itself. The
ski-runner may even exist who looks upon climbing
a mountain as an altogether exasperating,
but unfortunately inevitable, preparation for a
run down, and whose ideal is an artificial jumping-hill
in his garden provided with a lift. I
have never met him.</p>

<h2><a name="APPENDIX" id="APPENDIX"></a>APPENDIX</h2>

<h3><a name="HOW_TO_PRACTISE" id="HOW_TO_PRACTISE"></a>HOW TO PRACTISE</h3>


<p>Broadly speaking, your object in practising should be to learn
to run first <em>safely</em>, then <em>easily</em>, and then <em>quickly</em>. This is more
or less equivalent to saying that you should first learn <em>braking</em>,
then <em>turning</em>, and only then <em>free straight-running</em>, and that you
should practise on slopes of <em>gradually increasing steepness</em> as
well as in all sorts of snow.</p>

<p>You should, moreover, by very easy stages, learn jumping
from the very outset.</p>

<p>You will hardly be able to follow the first part of this advice
quite literally, for to learn to brake without learning something
about turning, or to do either without learning to run straight
at all is nearly impossible and quite unnecessary.</p>

<p>The following scheme for five days&#8217; practice is one way of
setting to work. If it does not suit you, by all means vary it,
but stick to the principle of learning every man&oelig;uvre in its
easiest form pretty thoroughly before passing to more difficult
ones, for this is the best way to gain confidence if you are
nervous, and to steady yourself and avoid bad habits if you
are inclined to be reckless.</p>

<p>Never think of learning to &#8220;do a Telemark&#8221; or anything
else for its own sake alone, and never look on jumping
as an extra.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I do not expect for a moment that a single one of my readers
will work through this course in detail exactly as I have set it
down, but these suggestions may at least give him something to
disagree with and rearrange.</p>

<p>Some further explanation of the arrangement of the first
three days&#8217; practice may be a help. The idea is that on each
day the beginner shall practise both on <em>hard</em> and <em>soft</em> snow
(by all means let him find breakable crust, too, for his stepping
and jumping round if he wants to be very thorough); that on
the first day he learns <em>braking</em> and the elements of <em>uphill</em>
turning on <em>gentle</em> slopes, that next day on <em>steeper</em> slopes he
learns <em>braking</em>, <em>uphill</em> turns, and the elements of <em>downhill</em>
turning, and that on the third he learns to <em>brake</em> and turn
<em>uphill</em> and, if he can manage it, <em>downhill</em> on <em>really steep</em> slopes.
Incidentally he ought to learn quite enough about <em>straight-running</em>
to find that the least difficult part of his first practice-run.</p>

<p>The jumping and short-expedition day might very well&mdash;perhaps
<em>better</em>&mdash;be taken after the <em>second</em> day&#8217;s ordinary
practice instead of after the <em>third</em>, where I have put it.</p>

<p>By cutting the <em>downhill</em> turns out of the three days&#8217; practice
and learning them later, or by cutting out everything but the
various methods of <em>braking</em>, the beginner can more quickly
make himself efficient and safe (though of course slow)
as a tourist if he is in a great hurry to become one. But
however he varies his procedure, let him practise on different
sorts of snow and slopes of every steepness up to 30° or so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
from the very first. One mistake that nearly all beginners
make is that they never practise on anything like a really
steep slope, the result being that the greater part of their
practice is pure waste of time, and utterly useless to them
when they go for an expedition.</p>

<p>Finally, let me once more urge the beginner to do everything
he can to make things easier for himself. One excellent plan
if he is very nervous&mdash;or even if he is not&mdash;is, as Lieutenant
Bilgeri suggests, to learn the man&oelig;uvres of the descent <em>on the
level</em> at first, by getting under way with a few <em>running</em> steps
and then stemming or turning before he loses impetus. Another
plan (which should always be followed) is to try the position
for every man&oelig;uvre at a <em>standstill</em>, and to make sure that it
is accurate in every detail before attempting that man&oelig;uvre
while running. This can, of course, also be done without
skis, indoors. Indoor exercises being a pet fad of mine, I
herewith suggest a few as more or less direct aids to ski-ing&mdash;if
I had not been actually asked to do so, fear of ridicule
would have prevented me.</p>

<p>(1) Place heels together and knees touching, and try to turn
toes outwards until feet are in a straight line (kick-turn).</p>

<p>(2) Make as wide a straddle as possible, then try to make it
wider. Turn toes in as far as possible (snow-plough).</p>

<p>(3) Place yourself in Telemark position, right foot leading,
knees pressed inwards. Change with a jump to same position,
<em>left</em> foot leading. Repeat quickly, bringing your feet to <em>exactly</em>
the same places on the floor that they occupied before, and not
letting them point outwards.</p>

<p>(4) Stand on tiptoe, feet parallel and touching. Squat and
straighten up again repeatedly.</p>

<p>(5) Stand on one foot, holding the other clear of the floor; sit
on the heel and rise again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>(6) Stand on one leg and move the other about in all
directions.</p>

<p>(7) Stand with feet parallel and touching. Let yourself
slowly fall forwards, saving yourself at the last possible
moment by a jump with the feet together. Repeat this in
all directions.</p>

<p>(8) Stand with feet in straight line, one in front of the other.
Jump as high as you can, land, steadily balanced, on the spot
you left.</p>

<p>(9) Practise the &#8220;Sats,&#8221; both methods, also drawing up your
legs in the air, saving yourself from a forward fall in each case
either by dropping into Telemark position or by a jump forward
with both feet together.</p>

<p>(10) Stand with feet parallel and touching, knees together
and bent, body slightly stooping. Swing arms and shoulders,
and turn head as far round to the right as you can.
Reverse position sharply with a <em>jump</em>, so that feet then
point to the right, shoulders and head full to left. Repeat
this quickly.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>If you find any of the balancing exercises too easy, try
them with your eyes shut. Number (10) may not teach
you the &#8220;jerked&#8221; Christiania, but is highly beneficial to
the liver.</p>

Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
