PREFACE.

As this little book is intended chiefly for children, the
language is very simple. But to make matters still easier,
all words and allusions presenting the smallest difficulty
are explained either in footnotes or in the "Notes and
Explanations" at the end.

Advantage has been taken of the descriptions under the
several Illustrations to give a good deal of information
on the customs and usages of the ancient Irish people.

Although the book has been written for children, it will
be found, I hope, sufficiently interesting and instructive
for the perusal of older persons.

The book, as will be seen, contains a mixture of Irish
History, Biography, and Romance; and most of the pieces
appear in their present form now for the first time. A
knowledge of the History of the country is conveyed, partly
in special Historical Sketches, partly in the Notes under
the Illustrations, and partly through the Biography of
important personages, who flourished at various periods
from St. Brigit down to the Great Earl of Kildare. And
besides this, the Stories, like those of all other ancient
nations, teach History of another kind, very important in
its own way.

Ancient Irish Manuscript books contain great numbers
of Historical and Romantic Tales; and the specimens given
here in translation will, I am confident, give the reader a
very favourable impression of old Irish writings of this class.




I make the following acknowledgments of assistance, with pleasure
and thanks:&mdash;

To the Council of the Royal Irish Academy I am indebted for the
use of the blocks of many Illustrations in Wilde's "Catalogue of
Irish Antiquities."

I owe to the Council of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland
several Illustrations from their Journal.

Colonel Wood-Martin has given me the use of the blocks of several
of the Illustrations in his "Pagan Ireland."

Lord Walter FitzGerald has given me permission to reproduce the
drawing of the old Chapter House door in St. Patrick's Cathedral,
Dublin, from the "Journal of the Kildare Arch√¶ological Society."

And lastly, Messrs. Macmillan &amp; Co. have permitted me to print
portions of Lord Tennyson's poem, "The Voyage of Maildune."

LEGENDS AND EARLY HISTORY.[1]

In our Ancient books there are stories of five different
races of people who made their way to Ireland in old
times, with very exact accounts of their wanderings
before their arrival, and of the battles they fought
after landing. But these narratives cannot be depended
on, for they are not real History but Legends,
that is stories either wholly or partly fabulous. Of
the five early races, the two last, who were called
Dedannans and Milesians, were the most remarkable;
and they are mixed up with most of the old Irish
tales.

The Dedannans, coming from Greece, landed in
Ireland; and having overcome the people they found
there, became masters of the country. They had the
name of being great magicians; and ancient Irish
writings are full of tales of the marvellous spells of
[Pg 2]
their skilled wizards. They remained in possession
for about two hundred years, till the Milesians came,
as will now be related.

For many generations the Milesians, before their
arrival in Ireland, journeyed from one part of Europe
to another, seeking for some place of settlement.
And becoming at length weary of this state of
unrest, they consulted their chief druid, who was a
skilful seer, and bade him find out for them when
they were to end their wanderings, and where they
were to settle down. The druid, having thought the
matter over for a while, told them that far out on
the verge of the western sea was a lovely green
island called Inisfail,[2] or the Island of Destiny,
which was to be their final home and resting-place.
So they set out once more, and fared on from land to
land, keeping the Isle of Destiny ever in mind,
thinking of it by day and dreaming of it by night.
At last they arrived in Spain, where they lived for a
time. Here they were under the command of the
renowned hero "Miled of Spain,"[3] or Milesius, from
whom they came to be called Milesians.

Some old Irish writers say that while they dwelt
in Spain, their chiefs, as they gazed wistfully over
the waters northwards, one clear winter's night, from
the top of a tower at the place now called Corunna,
saw Inisfail like a dim white cloud on the sea, in the
[Pg 3]
far distance. However this may be, the eight sons
of Milesius, after their father's death&mdash;many centuries
before the Christian era&mdash;set sail with a fleet, and
soon arrived on the coast of Ireland. But before
they could land, the Dedannans, by their spells,
raised a furious tempest, which wrecked the fleet and
drowned five of the brothers with most of their crews.
The remaining three landed with their men; and
having defeated the Dedannans in battle, they took
possession of Ireland.



A fairy hill: an earthen mound at Highwood, near Lough Arrow, in Co.
Sligo. A fairy moat is also figured at page 15, and a  cairn at page 97.


When the Dedannans found that they were no
longer able to hold the country, the legend tells us
that they retired to secret dwellings under old forts,
moats, cairns, and beautiful green little hills: and
they became fairies, and built themselves glorious
palaces in their new underground abodes, all ablaze
with light, and glittering with gems and
gold.[Pg 4]

From that period forward, till the time of the
Danes, there were no more invasions; and the
Milesian kings and people were left to make their
own laws and manage the country as they thought
best, without any interference from outside.

In the History of Ireland from the settlement of
the Milesian Colony down to the time of St. Patrick,
that is, to the fifth century of the Christian Era,
there is a mixture of legend and fact; and it is often
hard to disentangle them, so as to tell which is truth
and which is fable. As we advance, the truth and
certainty increase, and the legend grows less, till we
arrive near the time of St. Patrick. From about
this period forward, we are able to tell the main
history of the country without any mixture of fable.

For a long time in the beginning the Irish people
were all pagans; and the kind of religion they had
will be presently described.

As early as the third or fourth century&mdash;long
before St. Patrick's arrival&mdash;there were some
Christians in Ireland; and it is believed that the
knowledge of Christianity was brought to them from
Britain: but on this point there is no certainty.
Their numbers gradually increased as time went on;
and when St. Patrick arrived he found some small
Christian congregations scattered here and there
through the country. But the main body of the
people were pagans; and to St. Patrick belongs the
glory of converting them. The history of his life-work
[Pg 5]
need not be told here, as it will be found
set forth in one of the Chapters of the "Child's
History of Ireland." It is enough to say that he
arrived in the year A.D. 432, with many companions
to aid him; and that after thirty-three years of
constant toil, he died in 465, leaving the great body
of the people Christians, and the country covered
with churches. St. Patrick was a man of strong
will, of great courage&mdash;fearing no danger while
doing his Master's work&mdash;and possessing mighty
power over those he mixed with and addressed.
He was more successful than any other missionary
after the time of the Apostles.

Some years before St. Patrick's arrival, a great king
ruled over Ireland (from 379 to 405) called Niall of
the Nine hostages. From him were descended most
of the kings who reigned over Ireland after his time
till the Anglo-Norman Invasion.[4]

From the earliest ages the Irish of Ulster were
in the habit of crossing the narrow sea to Alban or
Scotland, which can be seen plainly from the sea-cliffs
of Antrim; and many settled there and made
it their home. In the year 503, nearly forty years
after St. Patrick's death, a great colony of Irish&mdash;men,
women, and children&mdash;crossed over, commanded
by three princes, brothers, named Fergus,
Angus, and Lorne. In course of time the posterity
[Pg 6]
of these people mastered all Scotland; and from
Fergus, who was their first king, the kings of
Scotland were descended. At that time Ireland was
generally known by the name of Scotia, and the
Irish were called Scots; and from them Alban got
the name of Scotland.



Stone Hammers, used when metal was still scarce, or not known at
all. A wooden handle was fixed in the hole. Iron was known in
Ireland from the beginning of the Christian era, and gold, silver,
copper, and bronze, long before it.


In old times there were five provinces in Ireland:&mdash;Leinster,
Ulster, Connaught, Munster, and
Meath. Meath, which stretched from the Shannon
eastwards to the sea, and from Kildare on the south
to Armagh on the north, was about half the size
of Ulster. It was the last formed of the five,
and later on it disappeared as a province altogether.
The present counties of Meath and Westmeath
occupy only about half of it. In those times, the
county Louth belonged to Ulster, and Cavan and
Clare to Connaught.[Pg 7]

There was a king over each of the five provinces,
and over these again was a king of all Ireland, called
the Over-king or head king. The kings of Ireland
had their chief palace on the Hill of Tara in Meath;
where many of the forts and other remains of the
old buildings are still to be seen. But Tara was
deserted as a royal residence in the sixth century,
after which the kings of Ireland lived elsewhere.


II.

THE SONG OF INISFAIL.

I.


They came from a land beyond the sea,
And now o'er the western main,
Set sail, in their good ships, gallantly,
From the sunny land of Spain.
"Oh, where's the Isle we've seen in dreams,
Our destined home or grave?"&mdash;
Thus sung they, as by the morning's beams
They swept the Atlantic wave.


II.


And lo, where afar o'er ocean shines
A sparkle of radiant green,
As though in that deep lay em'rald mines,
Whose light through the wave was seen.
[Pg 8]
"'Tis Inisfail&mdash;'tis Inisfail!"
Rings o'er the echoing sea,
While, bending to Heav'n, the warriors hail
That home of the brave and free.


III.


Then turn'd they unto the Eastern wave,
Where now their Day-God's eye
A look of such sunny omen gave
As lighted up sea and sky.
Nor frown was seen through sky or sea,
Nor tear on leaf or sod,
When first on their Isle of Destiny
Our great forefathers trod.

Thomas Moore.



III.

THE RELIGION OF THE PAGAN IRISH.

So far as we are able to judge from our old writings,
the pagan Irish had no one religion common to all
the people, and no settled general form of worship.
They had many gods; and it would appear that
every person chose whatever god he pleased for
himself. Some worshipped idols; and we read of
certain persons who had spring wells for gods: while
some again adored fire, and others the sun and moon.
[Pg 9]
The people also worshipped the shee or fairies, who
were supposed to live in grand palaces underground,
as described at page 3. The persons who taught
the people all about these gods were the Druids,
who were the learned men of those times. They
were believed to be wizards, and some think that
they were pagan priests.

The pagan Irish had a dim notion of a sort of
heaven, a happy land of perpetual youth and peace.
It was believed that there were many happy lands
in different places, which were called by various
names, such as Moy-Mell, I-Brazil, and Tirnanoge.
Some were out in the Atlantic Ocean, off the western
coast, while others were down deep beneath lakes,
and some in caves under forts or cairns. They were
all inhabited by fairies, who sometimes carried off
mortals: and those whom they brought away hardly
ever came back. A fairy who wished to allure a
mortal often chanted a sort of magical song called
an incantation, which exercised a spell over the
person that listened to it.

There is a pretty story, more than a thousand
years old, in the Book of the Dun Cow, which
relates how Prince Connla of the Golden Hair, son
of the great king Conn the Hundred-fighter, was
carried off by a fairy from the western shore in
a crystal boat to Moy-Mell. One day&mdash;as the
story relates&mdash;while the king and Connla and many
nobles were standing on the sea-shore, a boat of
[Pg 10]
shining crystal approached from the west: and
when it had touched the land, a fairy, like a human
being, and richly dressed, came forth from it, and,
addressing Connla, tried to entice him into it. No
one saw this strange being save Connla alone,
though all heard the conversation: and the king
and the nobles marvelled, and were greatly troubled.
At last the fairy chanted the following words in a
very sweet voice: and the moment the chant was
ended, the poor young prince stepped into the crystal
boat, which in a moment glided swiftly away to the
west: and prince Connla was never again seen
in his native land.

&nbsp;
THE CHANT OF THE FAIRY TO CONNLA OF THE
GOLDEN HAIR.

I.


A land of youth, a land of rest,
A land from sorrow free;
It lies far off in the golden west,
On the verge of the azure sea.
A swift canoe of crystal bright,
That never met mortal view&mdash;
We shall reach the land ere fall of night,
In that strong and swift canoe:
[Pg 11]
We shall reach the strand
Of that sunny land
From druids and demons free;
The land of rest,
In the golden west,
On the verge of the azure sea!


II.


A pleasant land of winding vales, bright streams, and verdurous plains,
Where summer, all the live-long year, in changeless splendour reigns;
A peaceful land of calm delight, of everlasting bloom;
Old age and death we never know, no sickness, care, or gloom;

The land of youth,
Of love and truth,
From pain and sorrow free;
The land of rest,
In the golden west,
On the verge of the azure sea!


III.


There are strange delights for mortal men in that island of the west;
The sun comes down each evening in its lovely vales to rest:

And though far and dim
On the ocean's rim
[Pg 12]
It seems to mortal view,
We shall reach its halls
Ere the evening falls,
In my strong and swift canoe;
And ever more
That verdant shore
Our happy home shall he;
The land of rest,
In the golden west,
On the verge of the azure sea!


IV.


It will guard thee, gentle Connla of the flowing golden hair,
It will guard thee from the druids, from the demons of the air;[5]
My crystal boat will guard thee, till we reach that western shore,
Where thou and I in joy and love shall live for evermore:

From the druid's incantation,
From his black and deadly snare,
From the withering imprecation
Of the demon of the air,
[Pg 13]
It will guard thee, gentle Connla of the flowing golden hair;
My crystal boat will guard thee, till we reach that silver strand,
Where thou shalt reign in endless joy, the king of the Fairy-land!

From "Old Celtic Romances," by P. W. Joyce, LL.D.





Stone hatchet in the National
Museum, Dublin: probably used as
a battle-axe. Before metals came
into general use, tools and weapons
of various kinds, in Ireland as well
as in other countries, were made of
stone, flint being commonly used for
making cutting-instruments, such as
knives. But this was at a very early
period, mostly before the time when
our written history begins.



Bronze head of Irish battle-mace:
now in the National Museum
Dublin. It was fitted with a
handle which was fastened in the
socket; and it was used for striking
in battle. It is double the size of
the picture. Weapons of this kind
were in use at a very early time, long
before the beginning of our regular
history.



[Pg 14]
IV.

CUSTOMS AND MODES OF LIFE.

Our old books contain very full information regarding
the Irish people, and how they lived, more than a
thousand years ago.

In early times Ireland was almost everywhere
covered with forests; and there were great and
dangerous bogs and marshes, overgrown with reeds,
moss, and coarse grass.
Many of these bogs still
remain, but they are not
nearly so large or dangerous
as they were then.
Great tracts of country
were uninhabited, so that
the whole population
was much less than it
is now.



Ancient Irish bronze reaping-hook:
6 inches long. It was fitted with a
handle which was fastened in the
socket with a rivet. Now in the
National Museum, Dublin.


The people hunted and fished a great deal, partly
for food, partly to rid the country of noxious
creatures, and partly for sport; for the forests were
alive with wild animals of all kinds, and the rivers
and lakes teemed with fish. But no one then
thought it worth while to hunt foxes and hares for
sport, as people do now. They had much grander
game:&mdash;wild boars with long and dangerous tusks;
[Pg 15]
gigantic deer; and fierce wolves that lurked in caves
and thick woods. In the cleared parts of the
country there
was much pasture
and tillage
various kinds of
corn and vegetables
were
grown, and the
land was very
fertile and well
watered with springs and rivulets.



A moat: at Patrickstown, near Oldcastle,
Co. Meath. Some moats were burial mounds.
See pages 16 and 59.


There was more pasture than tillage; and the pasture
land was not fenced in, but was grazed in common.
The law was very particular in laying down
rules about the fences of tillage lands&mdash;that they
should be properly made, and that when two farms
lay next each other, each man should do half the
fencing work. Oxen were generally used for ploughing:
horses seldom. Generally two oxen were put
to one plough, but sometimes four, and sometimes
even six. While one man held the plough, another
walked in front to lead the animals.

On account of the great forests and bogs, there
were many large districts where it was hard to go
long distances across country from place to place:
and often impossible. But in all the inhabited parts
there were roads or cleared paths. The roads of
those times were however very rough, and not nearly
[Pg 16]
so good as our present roads. Rivers were crossed
by bridges made of rough planks or wickerwork&mdash;for
there were no stone bridges&mdash;or by wading at
shallow fords, or by little ferry boats.

The people lived in houses almost always made of
timber, generally round-shaped or oval, but sometimes
four-cornered and oblong like our present
houses. In order to keep off wild beasts and
robbers, there was a high embankment of earth, with
a deep trench, round every house. Many of these
earthworks still remain all over Ireland, and are well
known by the names lis, rath, fort, &amp;c.; and some
have high mounds commonly called moats.



Grain-rubber: 16 inches long. People ground their corn with this
before the invention of querns and milk. The grain was put between
the two stones, and the upper stone was worked backwards and forwards
with the hands. It was very hard and tedious work. See p. 17.


The food of the people was not very different from
what it is at present, except that they had no
potatoes, which were brought to Ireland for the first
time about 300 years ago: and there was no tea or
coffee. They used oats, wheat, rye, and barley,
ground and made into bread; fish; and for those
who could afford it, the flesh of various animals,
[Pg 17]
either boiled or roast. Oatmeal porridge or stirabout
was in very general use, especially for children.
They ground their corn with small watermills, or
with handmills called querns, one of which was kept
in almost every house. Querns were in use before
the earliest time that our history reaches; and
water-mills were introduced before the arrival of
St. Patrick. In those early ages there was no sugar,
and honey was greatly valued, so that beehives were
kept everywhere.





Ancient Irish bronze caldron for
boiling meat, 12&frac12; inches deep, formed
of plates beautifully rivetted together.
It shows marks and signs of long use
over a fire. Now in the National
Museum, Dublin.




Irish drinking vessel, called a
Mether. They drank from the
corners. At meals, the same
mether was used by several
persons, who drank from it in
turn.


For drink, they had, besides plain water and
milk, ale, and a sweet sort of liquor called mead
both of which were made at home, and often wine,
which was brought from the continent. There was
then no whiskey.[Pg 18]

In those days there were no hotels or inns as
there are now, where a person could have board and
lodging for payment; but they were not much
needed then, as travellers were otherwise well
provided for. Besides the monasteries, which, as we
shall see further on, were always open and free to
wayfarers, there were, all through the country, what
were called "Houses of public hospitality." The
keeper of one of those houses was called a Brugaid
and sometimes a Beetagh; and his office was considered
very high and honourable. A brugaid or
beetagh had to keep an open house for travellers
who were always welcome, and received bed and food
free of charge. He was obliged by law to keep
constantly in hands a large stock of provisions;
and he should have a certain number of beds and
all other necessary household furniture. To enable
a brugaid to keep up such an expensive establishment,
he had the house itself and a large tract
of land, free of rent and taxes, besides other liberal
allowances.

The law required that there should be several
open roads leading to the residence of every brugaid;
and that a light should always be kept burning in
the lawn at night to guide travellers to the house.

The people dressed well according to their means.
Both men and women were fond of bright coloured
garments, which were not hard to procure, as the art
of dyeing in all the various hues was well understood.
[Pg 19]
It was usual for the same person to wear clothes
of several brilliant colours: and sometimes the long
outside mantle worn by men and women was striped
and spotted with purple, yellow, green, or other dyes
like Joseph's coat of many colours. Those who were
able to afford it wore rings, bracelets, necklaces,
gorgets, brooches, and other ornaments, made of gold,
silver, and a sort of white bronze.

[Pg 20]

The Irish metal workers were very skilful. They
made brooches, rings, bracelets, croziers, crosses, and
other such articles, in gold, silver, whitish bronze,
gems, and enamel, of which many have been found
in the earth from time to time, and are now kept
in museums: and some of them are so skilfully and
beautifully wrought that no artificer of the present
day can imitate them.

There were men of the several professions, such as
medical doctors, lawyers, judges, builders, poets,
historians: and all through the country were to be
found tradesmen of the various crafts&mdash;carpenters,
smiths, workers in gold, silver, and brass, ship and
boat builders, masons, shoemakers, dyers, tailors,
brewers, and so-forth: all working industriously and
earning their bread under the old irish laws, which
were everywhere acknowledged and obeyed. Then
there was a good deal of commerce with Britain and
with Continental countries, especially France; and
the home commodities, such as hides, salt, wool, etc.,
were exchanged for wine, silk, satin, and other goods
not produced in Ireland.

From what has been said here, we may see that
the ancient Irish were orderly and regular in their
way of life&mdash;quite on a level in this respect with the
people of those other European countries of the same
period that had a proper settled government; and,
it will be shown further on in this book, that they
were famed throughout all Europe for Religion and
Learning.[Pg 21]

The greatest evil of the country was war; for the
kings and chiefs were very often fighting with each
other, which brought great misery on the poor people
where the disturbances took place. But in those
early times war was common in all countries;
and in this respect there was no more trouble in
Ireland than in England, Scotland, and the countries
of the Continent.



Flint arrow-heads. The head was fixed on the top of the shaft with
cord of some kind, or with dried gut or tendon. Flint was used at a
very early period when metals were either not known at all or were
still very scarce. The makers of flint implements shaped them by
chipping with stone hammers, in which they were very skilful and
expert.

The Fate of the Children of Lir[6]; or,
The Four White Swans.

V.

HOW THE CHILDREN OF LIR WERE TURNED
INTO SWANS.

During the time when the Dedannans ruled in Erin,
there was a chief named Lir, who lived in Ulster,
and who was much beloved for his goodness and his
hospitality. He had four little children: a girl,
named Finola, who was the eldest, and three boys,
Aed, Ficra, and Conn: and Finola and Aed were
twins, as were also Ficra and Conn. Their mother
died when they were very young, and they were
then placed in charge of one of Lir's friends named
Eva, who was a witch-lady.

[Pg 23]
The four children grew up under Eva's care. She
nursed them with great tenderness, and her love for
them increased every day. They slept near their
father; and he would often rise from his own bed at
the dawn of morning, and go to their beds to talk
with them and to fondle them. And they were the
delight and joy of all the Dedannans, who often
came to Lir's house to see them. For nowhere could
four lovelier children be found; so that those who
saw them were always delighted with their beauty
and their gentleness, and could not help loving them
with all their heart.

Now when Eva saw that the children of Lir
received such attention and affection from all, she
fancied she was neglected on their account; and a
poisonous dart of jealousy entered her heart, which
turned her love to hatred; and she began to have
feelings of bitter enmity for the children.

Her jealousy so preyed on her that she feigned
illness, and lay in bed for nearly a year, filled with
gall and brooding mischief; and at the end of that
time she committed a foul and cruel deed of treachery
on the children of Lir.

One day she ordered her horses to be yoked
to her chariot, and she set out for the palace of
the Dedannan king, Bove Derg, bringing the four
children with her. Finola did not wish to go, for
it was revealed to her darkly in a dream that Eva
was bent on some dreadful deed; and she knew well
[Pg 24]
that the witch-lady intended to kill her and her
brothers that day, or in some other way to bring
ruin on them. But she was not able to avoid the
fate that awaited her; so she went.

They fared on towards the palace, which was
situated near Lough Derg in the south, till they
came to the shore of Lake Darvra,[7] where they
alighted; and the horses were unyoked. Eva led
the children to the edge of the lake, and told them
to go to bathe; and as soon as they had got into the
clear water, she struck them one by one with a
druidical fairy wand, and turned them into four
beautiful snow-white swans. And she addressed
them in these words&mdash;


Out to your home, ye swans, on Darvra's wave;
With clamorous birds begin your life of gloom:
Your friends shall weep your fate, but none can save;
For I've pronounced the dreadful words of doom.


After this, the four children of Lir turned towards
the witch-lady; and Finola spoke&mdash;

"Evil is the deed thou hast done, O Eva; thy
friendship to us has been a friendship of treachery;
and thou hast ruined us without cause. But the
power of thy witchcraft is not greater than the
druidical power of our friends to punish thee; and
[Pg 25]
the doom that awaits thee shall be worse than
ours."


The witch-lady loved us long ago;
The witch-lady now has wrought us woe;
With magical wand and fearful words,
She changed us to beautiful snow-white birds;
And we live on the waters for evermore,
By tempests driven from shore to shore.


Finola again spoke and said, "Tell us now how
long we shall be in the shape of swans, so that we
may know when our miseries shall come to an
end."

"It would be better for you if you had not put
that question," said Eva; "but I will declare the
truth to you, as you have asked me. Three hundred
years on smooth Lake Darvra; three hundred years
on the Sea of Moyle, between Erin and Alban;[8] three
hundred years at Inish Glora[9] on the Western Sea.
Until the union of Largnen, the prince from the
north, with Decca, the princess from the south; until
the Taillkenn[10] shall come to Erin, bringing the light
of a pure faith; and until ye hear the voice of the
Christian bell. And neither by your own power, nor
[Pg 26]
by mine, nor by the power of your friends, can ye be
freed till the time comes."

Then Eva repented what she had done; and she
said, "Since I cannot afford you any other relief,
I will allow you to keep your own Gaelic speech, and
ye shall be able to sing sweet, plaintive fairy music,
which shall excel all the music of the world, and
which shall lull to sleep all that listen to it. Moreover,
ye shall retain your human reason; and ye shall
not be in grief on account of being in the shape of
swans."

And she chanted this lay&mdash;


Depart from me, ye graceful swans;
The waters are now your home:
Your palace shall be the pearly cave,
Your couch the crest of the crystal wave,
And your mantle the milk-white foam!

Depart from me, ye snow-white swans,
With your music and Gaelic speech:
The crystal Darvra, the wintry Moyle,
The billowy margin of Glora's isle;&mdash;
Three hundred years on each!

Victorious Lir, your hapless sire,
His loved ones in vain shall call;
His weary heart is a husk of gore,
His home is joyless for evermore,
And his anger on me shall fall!
[Pg 27]
Through circling ages of gloom and fear
Your anguish no tongue can tell;
Till faith shall shed her heavenly rays,
Till ye hear the Taillkenn's anthem of praise,
And the voice of the Christian bell!


Then ordering her steeds to be yoked to her
chariot, she set out once more for the palace
leaving the four white swans swimming on the lake.


Our father shall watch and weep in vain;
He never shall see us return again.
Four pretty children, happy at home;
Four white swans on the feathery foam;
And we live on the waters for evermore,
By tempests driven from shore to shore.



VI.

THE FOUR WHITE SWANS ON LAKE
DARVRA.

Lir and his people, hearing that Eva had arrived
at Bove Derg's palace without the children, became
alarmed, and went southwards without delay; till
passing by the shore of Lake Darvra, they saw the
swans. And the swans swam up and spoke to them,
at which they wondered greatly. But when they told
Lir that they were indeed his four children whom
[Pg 28]
the witch-lady had turned into birds, he and his
people were struck with amazement and horror; and
they uttered three long mournful cries of grief and
lamentation. And when Lir had heard from Finola
how the matter happened, he prepared to set out
in quest of Eva. And bidding farewell to the
children for a time, he chanted this lay:&mdash;


The time has come for me to part:
No more, alas! my children dear,
Your rosy smiles shall glad my heart,
Or light the gloomy home of Lir.

Dark was the day when first I brought
This Eva in my home to dwell!
Hard was the woman's heart that wrought
This cruel and malignant spell!

I lay me down to rest in vain;
For, through the livelong, sleepless night,
My little lov'd ones, pictured plain,
Stand ever there before my sight.

Finola, once my pride and joy;
Dark Aed, adventurous and bold;
Bright Ficra, gentle, playful boy;
And little Conn, with curls of gold;&mdash;

Struck down on Darvra's reedy shore,
By wicked Eva's magic power:
Oh, children, children, never more
My heart shall know one peaceful hour.


[Pg 29]

After this he fared southwards till he arrived at
the palace, where he found Eva. And the king,
Bove Derg, when Lir had told him what Eva had
done, was in great wrath; for he loved those little
children. And calling Eva to him he spoke to her
fiercely and asked her what shape of all others,
on the earth, or above the earth, or beneath the
earth, she most abhorred, and into which she most
dreaded to be transformed.

And she, being forced to answer truly, said, "A
demon of the air."

"That is the form you shall take," said Bove
Derg; and as he spoke he struck Eva with a
druidical magic wand, and turned her into a demon
of the air. She opened her wings, and flew with
a scream upwards and away through the clouds;
and she is still a demon of the air, and she shall
be a demon of the air till the end of time.

After this, Lir and the Dedannans came to live
on the shore of the lake, to be near the swans and
to speak with them. And so the swans passed their
time on the waters. During the day they discoursed
lovingly with their father and their friends; and at
night they chanted their slow, sweet, fairy music,
the most delightful that was ever heard by men;
so that all who listened to it, even those who were in
grief, or sickness, or pain, forgot their sorrows and
their sufferings, and fell into a gentle, sweet sleep
from which they awoke bright and happy.[Pg 30]

At last the three hundred years[11] came to an end,
and Finola said to her brothers:&mdash;

"Do you know, my dear brothers, that we have
come to the end of our time here; and that we have
only this one night to spend on Lake Darvra?"

When the three sons of Lir heard this, they were
in great distress and sorrow; for they were almost as
happy on Lake Darvra, surrounded by their friends,
and conversing with them day by day, as if they had
been in their father's house in their own natural
shapes; whereas they should now live on the gloomy
and tempest-tossed Sea of Moyle, far away from all
human society.

Early next morning, the swans came to the
margin of the lake to speak to their father and
their friends for the last time, and to bid them
farewell; and Finola chanted this lay&mdash;

I.


Farewell, farewell, our father dear!
The last sad hour has come:
Farewell, Bove Derg! farewell to all,
Till the dreadful day of doom!
We go from friends and scenes beloved,
To a home of grief and pain;
And that day of woe
Shall come and go,
Before we meet again!


[Pg 31]
II.


We live for ages on stormy Moyle,
In loneliness and fear;
The kindly words of loving friends
We never more shall hear.
Four joyous children long ago;
Four snow-white swans to-day;
And on Moyle's wild sea
Our robe shall be
The cold and briny spray.


III.


Far down on the misty stream of time,
When three hundred years are o'er,
Three hundred more in storm and cold,
By Glora's desolate shore;
Till Decca fair is Largnen's spouse;
Till north and south unite;
Till the hymns are sung,
And the bells are rung,
At the dawn of the pure faith's light.


IV.


Arise, my brothers, from Darvra's wave
On the wings of the southern wind;
We leave our father and friends to-day
In measureless grief behind.
[Pg 32]
Ah! sad the parting, and sad our flight
To Moyle's tempestuous main;
For the day of woe
Shall come and go,
Before we meet again!


The four swans then spread their wings, and rose
from the surface of the water in sight of all their
friends, till they reached a great height in the air;
then resting, and looking downwards for a moment,
they flew straight to the north, till they alighted
on the Sea of Moyle between Erin and Alban.


VII.

THE FOUR WHITE SWANS ON THE SEA OF
MOYLE.

Miserable was the abode and evil the plight of the
children of Lir on the Sea of Moyle. Their hearts
were wrung with sorrow for their father and their
friends; and when they looked towards the steep
rocky, far-stretching coasts, and saw the great, dark,
wild sea around them, they were overwhelmed with
fear and despair. They began also to suffer from
cold and hunger, so that all the hardships they had
endured on Lake Darvra appeared as nothing
compared with their suffering on the sea-current of
Moyle.[Pg 33]

And so they lived, till one night a great tempest
fell upon the sea. Finola, when she saw the sky
filled with black, threatening clouds, thus addressed
her brothers:&mdash;

"Beloved brothers, we have made a bad preparation
for this night: for it is certain that the
coming storm will separate us; and now let us
appoint a place of meeting, or it may happen that
we shall never see each other again."

And they answered, "Dear sister, you speak truly
and wisely; and let us fix on Carricknarone,[12] for that
is a rock that we are all very well acquainted with."

And they appointed Carricknarone as their place
of meeting.

Midnight came, and with it came the beginning of
the storm. A wild, rough wind swept over the dark
sea, the lightnings flashed, and the great waves rose,
and increased their violence and their thunder.

The swans were soon scattered over the waters,
so that not one of them knew in what direction
the others had been driven. During all that night
they were tossed about by the roaring winds and
waves, and it was with much difficulty they preserved
their lives.

Towards morning the storm abated, the sky
cleared, and the sea became again calm and smooth;
and Finola swam to Carricknarone. But she found
[Pg 34]
none of her brothers there, neither could she see any
trace of them when she looked all round from the
summit of the rock over the wide face of the sea.

Then she became terrified, thinking she should
never see them again; and she began to lament
them plaintively.

[On this incident Thomas Moore wrote the
following beautiful song. A person is supposed to
be listening to Finola, and&mdash;in the first four lines
of the song&mdash;calls on the winds and the waves to
be silent that he may hear.]

Silent, O Moyle!


Silent, O Moyle! be the roar of thy water,
Break not, ye breezes! your chain of repose,
While, murmuring mournfully, Lir's lonely daughter
Tells to the night-star her tale of woes.
When shall the Swan, her death-note singing,
Sleep with wings in darkness furl'd?
When will Heav'n, its sweet bell ringing,
Call my spirit from this stormy world?

Sadly, O Moyle! to thy winter-wave weeping,
Fate bids me languish long ages away;
Yet still in her darkness doth Erin lie sleeping
Still doth the pure light its dawning delay
When will that day-star, mildly springing,
Warm our Isle with peace and love?
When will Heaven, its sweet bell ringing,
Call my spirit to the fields above?

[Pg 35]

At last, while she stood gazing in despair over the
waste of waters, she saw her brothers swimming
from different directions towards the rock. They
came to her one by one, and she welcomed them
joyfully: and she placed Aed under the feathers of
her breast, and Ficra and Conn under her wings,
and said to them:&mdash;"My dear brothers, though ye
may think last night very bad, we shall have many
like it from this time forth."

So they continued for a long time on the Sea
of Moyle, suffering hardships of every kind, till one
winter night came upon them, of great wind and of
snow and frost so severe, that nothing they ever
before suffered could be compared to the misery of
that night. The swans remained on Carricknarone,
and their feet and their wings were frozen to the icy
surface, so that they had to strive hard to move from
their places in the morning; and they left the skin
of their feet, the quills of their wings, and the
feathers of their breasts clinging to the rock.

"Sad is our condition this night, my beloved
brothers," said Finola, "for we are forbidden to leave
the Sea of Moyle; and yet we cannot bear the salt
water, for when it enters our wounds, I fear we shall
die of pain." And she uttered these words&mdash;


Our life is a life of woe;
No shelter or rest we find:
How bitterly drives the snow;
How cold is this wintry wind!
[Pg 36]
From the icy spray of the sea,
From the wind of the bleak north-east,
I shelter my brothers three,
Under my wings and breast.

The witch-lady sent us here,
And misery well we know:&mdash;
In cold and hunger and fear;
Our life is a life of woe![13]


They were, however, forced to swim out on the
stream of Moyle, all wounded and torn as they were;
for though the brine was sharp and bitter, they
were not able to avoid it. They stayed as near the
coast as they could, till after a long time the feathers
of their breasts and wings grew again, and their
wounds were healed.

After this the swans lived on for a great number of
years, sometimes visiting the shores of Erin, and
sometimes the headlands of Alban. But they always
returned to the sea-stream of Moyle, for it was to be
their home till the end of three hundred years.

One day they came to the mouth of the Bann,
on the north coast of Erin, and looking inland, they
saw a stately troop of horsemen approaching directly
from the south-west. They were mounted on white
steeds, and clad in bright-coloured garments, and
[Pg 37]
as they wound towards the shore their arms glittered
in the sun.

These were a party of the Dedannans who had
been a long time searching for the children of Lir
along the northern shores of Erin: and now that
they had found them, they were joyful; and they
and the swans greeted each other with tender
expressions of friendship and love. The children of
Lir inquired after the Dedannans, and particularly
after their father Lir; and for Bove Derg, and for
all the rest of their friends and acquaintances.

"They are well," replied the Dedannans; "but all
are mourning for you since the day you left Lake
Darvra. And now we wish to know how you fare
on this wild sea."

"Miserable has been our life since that day," said
Finola; "and no tongue can tell the suffering and
sorrow we have endured on the Sea of Moyle." And
she chanted these words&mdash;


Ah, happy is Lir's bright home to-day,
With mead and music and poet's lay:
But gloomy and cold his children's home,
For ever tossed on the briny foam.

Our wreath√®d feathers are thin and light
When the wind blows keen through the wintry night:
Yet often we were robed, long, long ago,
In purple mantles and furs of snow.
[Pg 38]
On Moyle's bleak current our food and wine
Are sandy sea-weed and bitter brine:
Yet oft we feasted in days of old,
And hazel-mead drank from cups of gold.

Our beds are rocks in the dripping caves;
Our lullaby song the roar of the waves:
But soft rich couches once we pressed,
And harpers lulled us each night to rest.

Lonely we swim on the billowy main,
Through frost and snow, through storm and rain:
Alas for the days when round us moved
The chiefs and princes and friends we loved!

My little twin brothers beneath my wings
Lie close when the north wind bitterly stings,
And Aed close nestles before my breast;
Thus side by side through the night we rest.

Our father's fond kisses, Bove Derg's embrace,
The light of Mannanan's godlike face,
The love of Angus&mdash;all, all are o'er;
And we live on the billows for evermore!


After this they bade each other farewell, for it
was not permitted to the children of Lir to remain
away from the stream of Moyle.


[Pg 39]
VIII.

HOW THE CHILDREN OF LIR REGAINED
THEIR HUMAN SHAPE AND DIED.

Great was the misery of the Children of Lir on
the sea of Moyle till their three hundred years were
ended. Then Finola said to her brothers&mdash;

"It is time for us to leave this place, for our period
here has come to an end."


The hour has come; the hour has come;
Three hundred years have passed:
We leave this bleak and gloomy home,
And we fly to the west at last!

We leave for ever the stream of Moyle;
On the clear, cold wind we go;
Three hundred years round Glora's Isle,
Where wintry tempests blow!

No sheltered home, no place of rest,
From the tempest's angry blast:
Fly, brothers, fly, to the distant west,
For the hour has come at last!


So the swans left the Sea of Moyle, and flew
westward, till they reached the sea round the
Isle of Glora. There they remained for three
[Pg 40]
hundred years, suffering much from storm and cold,
and in nothing better off than they were on the
Sea of Moyle. Towards the end of that time, St.
Patrick came to Erin with the pure faith; and
St. Kemoc, one of his companions, came to Inish
Glora. The first night Kemoc came to the island,
the children of Lir heard his bell at early matin
time, ringing faintly in the distance. And the three
sons of Lir trembled with fear, for the sound was
strange and dreadful to them. But Finola knew
well what it was; and she soothed them and said:&mdash;"My
dear brothers, this is the voice of the Christian
bell: and now the end of our suffering is near: for
this bell is the signal that we shall soon be freed
from our spell, and released from our life of suffering;
for God has willed it."

And when the bell ceased she chanted this lay&mdash;


Listen, ye swans, to the voice of the bell,
The sweet bell we've dreamed of for many a year;
Its tones floating by on the night breezes, tell
That the end of our long life of sorrow is near!

Listen, ye swans, to the heavenly strain;
'Tis the anchoret tolling his soft matin bell:
He has come to release us, from sorrow, from pain,
From the cold and tempestuous shores where we dwell!
[Pg 41]
Trust in the glorious Lord of the sky;
He will free us from Eva's druidical spell:
Be thankful and glad, for our freedom is nigh,
And listen with joy to the voice of the bell!


"Let us sing our music now," said Finola.

And they chanted a low, sweet, plaintive strain of
fairy music, to praise and thank the great high King
of heaven and earth.

Kemoc heard the music from where he stood; and
he listened with great astonishment. And he came
and spoke to the swans, and asked them were they
the children of Lir. They replied, "We are indeed
the children of Lir, who were changed long ago into
swans by the spells of the witch-lady."

"I give God thanks that I have found you," said
Kemoc; "for it is on your account I have come to
this little island." Then he brought them to his
own house; and, sending for a skilful workman, he
caused him to make two bright, slender chains of
silver; and he put a chain between Finola and Aed,
and the other chain he put between Ficra and Conn.
And there they lived with Kemoc in content and
happiness.

Now there was in that place a certain king named
Largnen, whose queen was Decca: the very king and
queen whom the witch-lady had foretold on the day
when she changed the children into swans, nine
hundred years before. And Queen Decca, hearing
[Pg 42]
all about those wonderful speaking swans, wished to
have them for herself: so she sent to Kemoc for
them; but he refused to give them. Whereupon the
queen waxed very wroth: and her husband the king,
when she told him about it, was wroth also: and he
set out straightway for Kemoc's house to bring the
swans away by force. The swans were at this time
standing in the little church with Kemoc. And
Largnen coming up, seized the two silver chains, one
in each hand, and drew the birds towards the door;
while Kemoc followed him, much alarmed lest they
should be injured.

The king had proceeded only a little way, when
suddenly the white feathery robes faded and disappeared;
and the swans regained their human
shape, Finola being transformed into an extremely
old woman, and the three sons into three feeble old
men, white-haired and bony and wrinkled.

When the king saw this, he started with affright,
and instantly left the place without speaking one
word.

As to the children of Lir, they turned towards
Kemoc; and Finola spoke&mdash;

"Come, holy cleric, and baptise us without delay,
for our death is near. You will grieve after us, O
Kemoc; but in truth you are not more sorrowful at
parting from us than we are at parting from you.
Make our grave here and bury us together; and as I
often sheltered my brothers when we were swans, so
[Pg 43]
let us be placed in the grave&mdash;Conn standing near
me at my right side, Ficra at my left, and Aed before
my face."[14]


Come, holy priest, with book and prayer
Baptise and bless us here:
Haste, cleric, haste, for the hour has come
And death at last is near!

Dig our grave&mdash;a deep, deep grave,
Near the church we loved so well;
This little church, where first we heard
The voice of the Christian bell.

As oft in life my brothers dear
Were sooth'd by me to rest&mdash;
Ficra and Conn beneath my wings,
And Aed before my breast;

So place the two on either hand&mdash;
Close, like the love that bound me;
Place Aed as close before my face,
And twine their arms around me

Thus shall we rest for evermore,
My brothers dear and I;
Haste, cleric, haste, baptise and bless,
For death at last is nigh!

[Pg 44]

Then the children of Lir were baptised, and they
died immediately. And when they died, Kemoc
looked up; and lo, he saw a vision of four lovely
children, with light, silvery wings, and faces all radiant
with joy. They gazed on him for a moment; but
even as they gazed, they vanished upwards, and he
saw them no more. And he was filled with gladness,
for he knew they had gone to heaven; but when he
[Pg 45]
looked down on the four bodies lying before him, he
became sad and wept.

And Kemoc caused a wide and deep grave to be
dug near the little church; and the children of Lir
were buried together, as Finola had directed&mdash;Conn
at her right hand, Ficra at her left, and Aed standing
before her face. And he raised a grave-mound over
them, placing a tombstone on it, with their names
graved in Ogham;[15] after which he uttered a lament
for them, and their funeral rites were performed.

So far we have related the sorrowful story of the
Fate of the Children of Lir.

HOW RELIGION AND LEARNING
FLOURISHED IN IRELAND.

As soon as St. Patrick had entered on his mission in
Ireland, he began to found monasteries, which continued
to spread through every part of the country
for hundreds of years after his time. Though
religion was their main object, these establishments
were among the chief means of spreading general
[Pg 46]
enlightenment among the people. Almost every
monastery had a school or college attached, at
the head of which was some man who was a
great scholar and teacher. The teachers were
generally monks: but many learned laymen were
also employed. Some colleges had very large numbers
of students: for instance, we are told that there
were 3000 in each of the two colleges of Clonard
and Bangor[16]; and many others might be named,
which, though not so large, had yet several hundred
students in each.

In these monasteries and their schools all was
life and activity. The monks were always busily
employed; some at tillage on the farm round the
monastery&mdash;ploughing, digging, sowing, reaping&mdash;some
teaching, others writing books. The duty of
a few was to attend to travellers, to wash their
feet and prepare supper and bed for them: for
strangers who called at the monastery were always
received with welcome, and got lodging, food, and
attendance from the monks, all free. Others of
the inmates, again, employed themselves in cooking,
or carpentry, or smithwork, or making clothes,
for the use of the community. Besides all this
they had their devotions to attend to, at certain
times, both day and night, throughout the year.
As for the students, they had to mind their own
[Pg 47]
simple household concerns, and each day when these
were finished they had plenty of employment in their
studies: for the professors kept them hard at work.

There were also great numbers of schools not
held in monasteries, conducted by laymen, some for
general learning, such as History, Poetry, Grammar,
Latin, Greek, Irish, the Sciences, &amp;c.; and some for
teaching and training young men for professions,
such as lawyers and doctors. And these schools
helped greatly to spread learning, though they were
not so well known outside Ireland as the monastic
schools.

The Irish professors were so famed for their learning,
and the colleges were so excellent, that students
came to them from every country of Europe: but
more from Great Britain than elsewhere. The Irish
were very much pleased to receive these foreign
students: and they were so generous that they
supplied them with food, gave them the manuscript
books they wanted to learn from, and taught them
too, all free of charge. Ireland was in those times the
most learned country in Europe, so that it was known
by the name of the Island of Saints and Scholars.

But the Irish scholars and missionaries did not
confine themselves to their own country. Great
numbers of them went abroad&mdash;to Britain and
elsewhere&mdash;to teach and to preach the Gospel to the
people. The professors from Ireland were held in
such estimation that they were employed to teach in
[Pg 48]
most of the schools and colleges of Great Britain and
the Continent.

We shall see that the Northern Picts of Scotland
were converted by St. Columkille and his monks
from Iona (see p. 144): and a large proportion of the
people of England became Christians through the
preaching of Irish monks before the arrival of
St. Augustine.[17]

The Irish missionaries, who went to the Continent,
in their eagerness to spread religion and knowledge,
penetrated to all parts of Europe: they even found
their way to Iceland. Few people have any idea of
the trials and dangers they encountered. Most of
them were persons in good position, who might have
lived in plenty and comfort at home. They knew
well, when setting out, that they were leaving
country and friends probably for ever: for of
those that went, very few ever returned. Once
on the Continent, they had to make their way
poor and friendless, through people whose language
they did not understand, and who were in many
places ten times more rude and dangerous in those
ages than the inhabitants of these islands: and we
know, as a matter of history, that many were killed
on the way. Then these earnest men had, of course,
to learn the language of the people among whom they
[Pg 49]
took up their abode: for until they did this they had
to employ an interpreter, which was a very troublesome
and slow way of preaching. But the noble-hearted
missionaries went forth to do their good
work; and no labours, hardships, or dangers could
turn them from their purpose.

More than three hundred years ago the great
English poet, Edmund Spenser, lived some time in
Ireland, and made himself very well acquainted with
its history. He knew what kind of a country it was
in past ages; so that in one of his poems he speaks
of the time


"When Ireland florish√®d in fame
Of wealth and goodnesse, far above the rest
Of all that beare the British Islands name."

numbers of gold objects, shaped like this, are in the National Museum,
some very large&mdash;one of them weighing 33 oz.: while others are quite
small, not bigger than a common coat-button. Besides being
ornaments, it is believed that they were used as money, as there were
no coins in use in very ancient times in Ireland.

THE RED BRANCH KNIGHTS.

Nearly two miles west of Armagh are the remains
of the ancient palace of Emain, or Emain Macha,
often called Emania. They consist of a great
circular rath or rampart of earth, with a deep trench
outside it, and a high mound within, the whole
structure covering a space of about thirteen acres.
At one time the circular ring was complete, but of
late years some portions of it have been levelled or
removed. The houses in which the kings and heroes
of old, with their numerous households, lived and
feasted, stood mostly within the enclosure, and were
all of wood, not a trace of which remains. This
great fort is now called by the people of the place,
the "Navan Fort," or "Navan Ring."

According to Irish legendary history, Emain was
founded about three centuries before the beginning
of the Christian era, by Macha of the Golden Hair,
queen of Ulster; and for more than six hundred
years it was the residence of the kings of that
province. But about the year A.D. 331, it was
destroyed by three princes from Tara, who invaded
and conquered that part of Ulster; after which
Emain was no longer inhabited.[Pg 51]

Early in the first century of the Christian era
flourished the Red Branch Knights, a band of heroes
in the service of Concobar (or Conor) Mac Nessa,
king of Ulster. There were several bodies of them,
under separate commanders, who lived in different
parts of the province. These leaders were the great
heroes of the Red Branch, who are celebrated in
ancient Irish romance, and who are mentioned by
Moore in his song, "Let Erin remember":&mdash;


"When her kings with standard of green unfurled
Led the Red Branch Knights to danger."


Every year during the summer months, various
companies of the Knights came to Emain under
their several commanders, to be drilled and trained
in military science and feats of arms. They were
lodged in a large separate building beside Emain,
called Creeveroe or the Red Branch&mdash;from which the
whole force took its name: and the townland in
which this great house stood is still called Creeveroe.
Each day the leaders were feasted by King
Concobar Mac Nessa in his own banquetting hall at
Emain.

The greatest of all the Red Branch heroes was
Cu-Culainn&mdash;"the mightiest hero of the Scots," as he
is called in one of the oldest of the Irish books&mdash;whose
residence was Dundalgan, a mile west of the
present town of Dundalk. This dun or fort consists
of a high mound surrounded by an earthen rampart
[Pg 52]
and trench, all of immense size, even in their ruined
state; but it has lost its old name and is now called
the Moat of Castletown, while the original name
Dundalgan, slightly altered, has been transferred to
Dundalk.

Another of these Red Branch Knights' residences
stands beside Downpatrick: viz., the great fort
anciently called (among other names) Dun-Keltair
or Rath-Keltair, where lived the hero, Keltar of the
Battles. It consists of a huge embankment of earth,
nearly circular, with the usual deep trench outside it,
covering a space of about ten acres.

Next to Cuculainn, the most renowned of those
knights were Fergus Mac Roy, Leary the Victorious,
Conall Carnagh, and the three Sons of Usna.

There were, at this same time, similar orders of
knights in the other provinces. Those of Munster
were commanded by Curoi Mac Dara, who lived in a
great stone fortress high up on the side of
Caherconree Mountain, near Tralee, the remains of
which may be seen to this day. He was a mighty
champion, and on one occasion vanquished Cuculainn
in single combat. The Connaught knights were in
the service of Maive, the warlike queen of that province,
whose residence was the palace of Croghan,
the ruins of which still remain near the village of
Rathcroghan in the north of Roscommon.

In the Book of the Dun Cow, the Book of Leinster,
and other old manuscripts (which will be found
[Pg 53]
described farther on), there are great numbers of
romantic stories about those Red Branch Knights,
and about the Knights of Munster and Connaught,
of which many have been translated and published.

The most celebrated of all these tales is what is
called the Tain or "Cattle spoil" of Quelna or
Cooley.[18] Queen Maive, having some cause of quarrel
with an Ulster chief, set out with her army for
the north on a plundering expedition, attended by
all the great heroes of Connaught. During the march
northwards, the queen, as the story tells us, had nine
splendid chariots for herself and her attendant chiefs,
her own in the centre, with two abreast in front, two
behind, and two on each side, right and left; and&mdash;in
the words of the old tale&mdash;"the reason for this
order was, lest the clods from the hoofs of the horses,
or the foam-flakes from their mouths, or the dust
raised by that mighty host, should strike and tarnish
the golden diadem on the head of the queen."

The invading army entered Quelna, which was then
a part of Ulster and belonged to Cuculainn. It happened
just then that the men of Ulster were under
a spell of feebleness, all but Cuculainn, who had to
defend single-handed the several fords and passes, in
a series of combats against Maive's best champions,
in all of which he was victorious. But, in spite
[Pg 54]
of what he could do, Queen Maive carried off
nearly all the best cattle of Quelna, and, at their
head, a great brown bull which indeed was what she
chiefly came for. At length the Ulstermen, having
been freed from the spell, attacked and routed the
Connaught army. The battles, single combats, and
other incidents of this war are related in the Tain,
which consists of one main story, with about thirty
minor tales grouped round it. Another Red Branch
story is the Fate of the Sons of Usna, which has been
always a favourite with Irish story-tellers, and with
the Irish people in general, and which is now
given here, translated in full.



A &quot;Cromlech,&quot; an ancient Irish tomb: still to be seen in its place
in the Ph&oelig;nix Park, Dublin. This is rather a small one, the covering
stone being only about 6&frac12; feet long. Some cromlechs are very large:
one at Kilternan near Dublin has a covering stone 23&frac12; feet long,
17 feet broad, and 6&frac12; feet thick: and no one can tell how the people
of old lifted it up.

XI.

THE FLIGHT TO ALBAN.

Concobar Mac Nessa king of Ulaid[20] ruled in Emain.
And his chief storyteller, Felimid, made a feast for
the king and for the knights of the Red Branch;
who all came to partake of it in his house. While
they were feasting right joyously, listening to the
sweet music of the harps and the mellow voices of
the bards, a messenger brought word that Felimid's
wife had given birth to a little daughter, an infant of
wondrous beauty. And when Caffa, the king's druid
and seer, who was of the company, was ware of the
birth of the child, he went forth to view the stars
and the clouds, if he might thereby glean knowledge
of what was in store for that little babe.[21] And when
he had returned to his place, he sat deep pondering
[Pg 56]
for a time: and then standing up and obtaining
silence, he said:&mdash;

"This child shall be called Deir-dr&#277;[22]; and fittingly
is she so named: for much of woe will befal
Ulaid and Erin in general on her account. There
shall be jealousies, and strifes, and wars: evil deeds
will be done: many heroes will be exiled: many will
fall."

When the heroes heard this they were sorely
troubled, and some said that the child should be
killed. But the king said:&mdash;"Not so, ye Knights of
the Red Branch, it is not meet to commit a base
deed in order to escape evils that may never come
to pass. This little maid shall be reared out of the
reach of mischief, and when she is old enough she
shall be my wife: thus shall I be the better able to
guard against those evils that Caffa forecasts for us."

And the Ultonians did not dare to gainsay the
word of the king.

Then king Concobar caused the child to be placed
in a strong fortress on a lonely spot nigh the palace,
with no opening in front, but with door and windows
looking out at the back on a lovely garden watered
by a clear rippling stream: and house and garden
were surrounded by a wall that no man could surmount.
And those who were put in charge of her
were, her tutor, and her nurse, and Concobar's
[Pg 57]
poetess, whose name was Lavarcam: and save these
three, none were permitted to see her. And so she
grew up in this solitude, year by year, till she was of
marriageable age; when she excelled all the maidens
of her time for beauty.

One snowy day as she and Lavarcam looked forth
from the window, they saw some blood on the snow,
where her tutor had killed a calf for dinner; and a
raven alighted and began to drink of it. "I should
like," said Deirdre, "that he who is to be my husband
should have these three colours: his hair as black as
the raven: his cheeks red as the blood: his skin
like the snow. And I saw such a youth in a
dream last night; but I know not where he is, or
whether he is living on the ridge of the world."

"Truly," said Lavarcam, "the young hero that
answers to thy words is not far from thee; for he is
among Concobar's knights: namely, Naisi the son of
Usna."

Now Naisi and his brothers, Ainnli and Ardan, the
three Sons of Usna, were the best beloved of all the
Red Branch Knights, so gracious and gentle were
they in time of peace, so skilful and swift-footed
in the chase, so strong and valiant in battle.

And when Deirdre heard Lavarcam's words, she
said:&mdash;"If it be as thou sayest, that this young
knight is near us, I shall not be happy till I see
him: and I beseech thee to bring him to speak to
me."[Pg 58]

"Alas, child," replied Lavarcam, "thou knowest
not the peril of what thou askest me to do: for if
thy tutor come to know of it, he will surely tell the
king; and the king's anger none can bear."

Deirdre answered not: but she remained for many
days sad and silent: and her eyes often filled with
tears through memory of her dream: so that Lavarcam
was grieved: and she pondered on the thing if it
could be done, for she loved Deirdre very much and
had compassion on her. At last she contrived that
these two should meet without the tutor's knowledge:
and the end of the matter was that they loved each
other: and Deirdre said she would never wed the
king, but she would wed Naisi.

Knowing well the doom that awaited them when
Concobar came to hear of this, Naisi and his young
wife and his two brothers, with thrice fifty fighting
men, thrice fifty women, thrice fifty attendants, and
thrice fifty hounds, fled over sea to Alban. And the
king of the western part of Alban received them
kindly and took them into military service. Here
they remained for a space, gaining daily in favour:
but they kept Deirdre apart, fearing evil if the king
should see her.

And so matters went on, till it chanced that the
king's steward, coming one day by Naisi's house, saw
the couple as they sat on their couch: and going
directly to his master, he said:&mdash;

"O king, we have long sought in vain for a
[Pg 59]
woman worthy to be thy wife, and now at last we
have found her: for the woman, Deirdre, who is
with Naisi, is worthy to be the wife of the king of
the western world. And now I give thee this
counsel:&mdash;Let Naisi be killed, and then take thou
Deirdre for thy wife."



A burial urn. The ancient Irish sometimes buried as we do now,
placing the body in the grave, over which they often raised a cairn
or a cromlech. Sometimes they burned the body and put the ashes
in an urn, which they placed under a cromlech, or cairn, or burial
mound. Urns were always made of clay, which was baked till it was
hard. They are often found in graves, especially under cairns and
cromlechs: and they nearly always contain ashes and bits of burnt
bones. Occasionally, as has been already said (p. 43, note), persons
were buried standing up, especially kings and warriors, who were
placed in the grave fully armed.


The king basely agreed to do so; and forthwith he
laid a plot to slay the sons of Usna; which matter
coming betimes to the ears of the brothers, they fled
by night with all their people. And when they had
got to a safe distance, they took up their abode in a
wild place, where with much ado they obtained food
[Pg 60]
by hunting and fishing. And the brothers built
them three hunting booths in the forest, a little
distance from that part of the seashore looking
towards Erin: and the booth in which their food
was prepared, in that they did not eat; and the one
in which they ate, in that they did not sleep. And
their people in like manner built themselves booths
and huts, which gave them but scant shelter from
wind and weather.

Now when it came to the ears of the Ultonians,
that the sons of Usna and their people were in
discomfort and danger, they were sorely grieved:
but they kept their thoughts to themselves, for
they dared not speak their mind to the king.


XII.

CONCOBAR'S GUILEFUL MESSAGE.

At this same time a right joyous and very splendid
feast was driven by Concobar in Emain Macha to the
nobles and the knights of his household. And the
number of the king's household that sat them down
in the great hall of Emain on that occasion was
five and three score above six hundred and one
thousand.[23] Then arose, in turn, their musicians to
[Pg 61]
sound their melodious harpstrings, and their poets
and their story-tellers to sing their sweet poetic
strains, and to recount the deeds of the mighty
heroes of the olden time. And the feasting and the
enjoyment went on, and the entire assembly were
gay and cheerful. At length Concobar arose from
where he sat high up on his royal seat; whereupon
the noise of mirth was instantly hushed. And he
raised his kingly voice and said:&mdash;

"I desire to know from you, ye Nobles and Knights
of the Red Branch, have you ever seen in any
quarter of Erin, a house better than this house of
Emain, which is my mansion: and whether you see
any want in it."

And they answered that they saw no better house,
and that they knew of no want in it.

And the king said: "I know of a great want:
namely, that we have not present among us the
three noble sons of Usna. And why now should
they be in banishment on account of any woman in
the world?"

And the nobles replied:&mdash;"Truly it is a sad thing
that the sons of Usna, our dear comrades, should be
in exile and distress. They were a shield of defence
to Ulaid: and now, O king, it will please us well
that thou send for them and bring them back,
lest they and their people perish by famine or
fall by their enemies."

"Let them come," replied Concobar, "and make
[Pg 62]
submission to me: and their homes, and their lands,
and their places among the Knights of the Red
Branch shall be restored to them."

Now Concobar was mightily enraged at the
marriage and flight of Naisi and Deirdre, though he
hid his mind from all men; and he spoke these
words pretending forgiveness and friendship. But
there was guile in his heart, and he planned to allure
them back to Ulaid that he might kill them.

When the feast was ended, and the company had
departed, the king called unto him Fergus Mac Roy,
and said:&mdash;"Go thou, Fergus, and bring back the
sons of Usna and their people. I promise thee that
I will receive them as friends should be received,
and that what awaits them here is not enmity or
injury, but welcome and friendship. Take my
message of peace and good will, and give thyself as
pledge and surety for their safety. But these two
things I charge thee to do:&mdash;That the moment you
land in Ulaid on your way back, you proceed straight
to Barach's house which stands on the sea cliff high
over the landing place fronting Alban: and that
whether the time of your arrival be by day or by
night, thou see that the sons of Usna tarry not,
but let them come hither direct to Emain, that they
may not eat food in Erin till they eat of mine."

And Fergus, suspecting no evil design, promised to
do as the king directed: for he was glad to be sent on
this errand, being a fast friend to the sons of
Usna.[Pg 63]

Fergus set out straightway, bringing with him
only his two sons, Illan the Fair and Buinni the Red,
and his shield bearer to carry his shield. And as
soon as he had departed, Concobar sent for Barach
and said to him:&mdash;

"Prepare a feast in thy house for Fergus: and
when he visits thee returning with the sons of Usna,
invite him to partake of it." And Barach thereupon
departed for his home to do the bidding of the king
and prepare the feast.

Now those heroes of old, on the day they received
knighthood, were wont to make certain pledges
which were to bind them for life, some binding
themselves to one thing, some to another. And as
they made the promises on the faith of their
knighthood, with great vows, in presence of kings
and nobles, they dared not violate them; no, not even
if it was to save the lives of themselves and all their
friends: for whosoever broke through his knighthood
pledge was foully dishonoured for evermore. And
one of Fergus's obligations was never to refuse an
invitation to a banquet: a thing which was well
known to King Concobar and to Barach.

As to Fergus Mac Roy and his sons: they went on
board their galley and put to sea, and made no delay
till they reached the harbour nigh the campment of
the sons of Usna. And coming ashore, Fergus gave
the loud shout of a mighty man of chase. The sons
of Usna were at that same hour in their booth; and
[Pg 64]
Naisi and Deirdre were sitting with a polished
chessboard between them playing a game.

And when they heard the shout, Naisi said:&mdash;"That
is the call of a man from Erin."

"Not so," replied Deirdre, "it is the call of a man
of Alban."

And after a little time when a second shout came,
Naisi said:&mdash;"That of a certainty is the call of a
man of Erin!"

But Deirdre again replied:&mdash;"No, indeed: it
concerns us not: let us play our game."

But when a third shout came sounding louder
than those before, Naisi arose and said:&mdash;"Now I
know the voice: that is the shout of Fergus!" And
straightway he sent Ardan to the shore to meet
him.

Now Deirdre knew the voice of Fergus from the
first: but she kept her thoughts to herself: for her
heart misgave her that the visit boded evil. And
when she told Naisi that she knew the first shout, he
said:&mdash;"Why, my queen, didst thou conceal it
then?"

And she replied:&mdash;"Lo, I saw a vision in my
sleep last night: three birds came to us from Emain
Macha, with three drops of honey in their beaks,
and they left us the honey and took away three
drops of our blood."

"What dost thou read from that vision, O
princess?" said Naisi.[Pg 65]

"It denotes the message from Concobar to us,"
said Deirdre; "for sweet as honey is the message
of peace from a false man, while he has thoughts
of blood hidden deep in his heart."

When Ardan arrived at the shore, the sight of
Fergus and his two sons was to him like rain on
the parched grass; for it was long since he had seen
any of his dear comrades from Erin. And he cried
out as he came near, "An affectionate welcome to
you my dear companions": and he fell on Fergus's
neck and kissed his cheeks, and did the like to his
sons. Then he brought them to the hunting-booth;
and Naisi, Ainnli, and Deirdre gave them a like kind
welcome; after which they asked the news from Erin.

"The best news I have," said Fergus, "is that
Concobar has sent me to you with kindly greetings,
to bring you back to Emain and restore you
to your lands and homes, and to your places in
the Red Branch; and I am myself a pledge for
your safety."

"It is not meet for them to go," said Deirdre:
"for here they are under no man's rule; and their
sway in Alban is even as great as the sway of
Concobar in Erin."

But Fergus said: "One's mother country is better
than all else, and gloomy is life when a man sees not
his home each morning."

"Far dearer to me is Erin than Alban," said Naisi,
"even though my sway should be greater here."[Pg 66]

It was not with Deirdre's consent he spoke these
words: and she still earnestly opposed their return
to Erin.

But Fergus tried to re-assure her:&mdash;"If all the
men of Erin were against you," said he, "it would
avail nought once I have passed my word for your
safety."

"We trust in thee," said Naisi, "and we will go
with thee to Erin."

XIII.

THE RETURN TO EMAIN.

Going next morning on board their galleys, Fergus
and his companions put out on the wide sea: and
oar and wind bore them on swiftly till they landed
on the shore of Erin near the house of Barach.[Pg 67]

And Deirdre, seating herself on a cliff, looked
sadly over the waters at the blue headlands of
Alban: and she uttered this farewell:&mdash;

I.

"Dear to me is yon eastern land: Alban with
its wonders. Beloved is Alban with its bright harbours
and its pleasant hills of the green slopes.
From that land I would never depart except to be
with Naisi.

II.

Kil-Cuan, O Kil-Cuan,[24] whither Ainnli was wont
to resort: short seemed the time to me while I
sojourned there with Naisi on the margins of its
streams and waterfalls.

III.

"Glen-Lee, O Glen-Lee, where I slept happy
under soft coverlets: fish and fowl, and the flesh of
red deer and badgers; these were our fare in Glen-Lee.

IV.

"Glen-Masan, O Glen-Masan: tall its cresses of
white stalks: often were we rocked to sleep in our
curragh in the grassy harbour of Glen-Masan.

[Pg 68]
V.

"Glen-Orchy, O Glen-Orchy: over thy straight
glen rises the smooth ridge that oft echoed to the
voices of our hounds. No man of the clan was more
light-hearted than my Naisi when following the
chase in Glen-Orchy.

VI.

"Glen-Ettive, O Glen-Ettive: there it was that
my first house was raised for me: lovely its woods
in the smile of the early morn: the sun loves to
shine on Glen-Ettive.

VII.

"Glen-da-Roy, O Glen-da-Roy: the memory of
its people is dear to me: sweet is the cuckoo's note
from the bending bough on the peak over Glen-da-Roy.

VIII.

"Dear to me is Dreenagh over the resounding
shore: dear to me its crystal waters over the speckled
sand. From those sweet places I would never depart,
but only to be with my beloved Naisi."


After this they entered the house of Barach; and
when Barach had welcomed them, he said to Fergus:
"Here I have a three-days banquet ready for thee,
and I invite thee to come and partake of it."
[Pg 69]

When Fergus heard this his heart sank and his
face waxed all over a crimson red: and he said
fiercely to Barach:&mdash;"Thou hast done an evil thing
to ask me to this banquet: for well thou knowest
I cannot refuse thee. Thou knowest, too, that I
am under solemn pledge to send the Sons of Usna
this very hour to Emain: and if I remain feasting
in thy house, how shall I see that my promise of
safety is respected?"

But none the less did Barach persist; for he was
one of the partners in Concobar's treacherous design.

Then Fergus turned to Naisi and said:&mdash;"I dare
not violate my knighthood promise: what am I to
do in this strait?" But Deirdre answered for her
husband:&mdash;"The choice is before thee, Fergus; and
it is more meet for thee to abandon thy feast than
to abandon the sons of Usna, who have come over on
thy pledge."

Then Fergus was in sore perplexity; and pondering
a little he said:&mdash;"I will not forsake the sons of
Usna: for I will send with them to Emain Macha
my two sons, Illan the Fair and Buinni the Red,
who will be their pledge instead of me."

But Naisi said: "We need not thy sons for guard
or pledge: we have ever been accustomed to defend
ourselves!" And he moved from the place in great
wrath: and his two brothers, and Deirdre, and the
two sons of Fergus followed him, with the rest of
the clan; while Fergus remained behind silent and
[Pg 70]
gloomy: for his heart misgave him that mischief
was brewing for the sons of Usna.

Then Deirdre tried to persuade the sons of Usna
to go to Rathlin between Erin and Alban, and tarry
there till Barach's feast was ended: but they did
not consent to do so, for they deemed it would be
a mark of cowardice: and they sped on by the
shortest ways towards Emain Macha.

When now they had come to Fincarn of the
Watch-tower on Slieve Fuad, Deirdre and her attendants
stayed behind the others a little: and she fell
asleep. And when Naisi missed her he turned back
and found her just awakening; and he said to her:&mdash;"Why
didst thou tarry, my princess?"

And she answered:&mdash;"I fell asleep and had a
dream. And this is what I saw in my dream:&mdash;Illan
the Fair took your part: Buinni the Red did
not: and I saw Illan without his head: but Buinni
had neither wound nor hurt."

"Alas, O beauteous princess," said Naisi, "thou
utterest nought but evil forebodings: but the king
is true and will not break his plighted word."

So they fared on till they had come to the Ridge
of the Willows,[25] an hour's journey from the palace:
and Deirdre, looking upwards in great fear, said to
Naisi:&mdash;"O Naisi, see yonder cloud in the sky over
Emain, a fearful chilling cloud of a blood-red tinge:
[Pg 71]
a baleful red cloud that bodes disaster! Come ye
now to Dundalgan and abide there with the mighty
hero Cuculainn till Fergus returns from Barach's
feast; for I fear Concobar's treachery."

But Naisi answered:&mdash;"We cannot follow thy
advice, beloved Deirdre, for it would be a mark of
fear: and we have no fear."

And as they came nigh the palace Deirdre said to
them:&mdash;"I will now give you a sign if Concobar
meditates good or evil. If you are brought into
his own mansion where he sits surrounded by his
nobles, to eat and drink with him, this is a token
that he means no ill; for no man will injure a guest
that has partaken of food at his table: but if you
are sent to the house of the Red Branch, be sure
he is bent on treachery."

When at last they arrived at the palace they
knocked loudly with the handwood: and the door-keeper
swang the great door wide open. And when
he had spoken with them he went and told Concobar
that the sons of Usna and Fergus's two sons had
come, with their people.

And Concobar called to him his stewards and
attendants and asked them:&mdash;"How is it in the house
of the Red Branch as to food and drink?" And they
replied that if the seven battalions of Ulaid were to
come to it they would find enough of all good things
"If that is so," said Concobar, "take the sons of Usna
and their people to the Red Branch."
[Pg 72]

Even then Deirdre besought them not to enter the
Red Branch: for she deemed now that of a certainty
there was mischief afoot. But Illan the Fair said:&mdash;"Never
did we show cowardice or unmanliness, and
we shall not do so now." Then she was silent and
went with them into the house.

And the company, when they had come in, sat
them down so that they filled the great hall: and
alluring viands and delicious drinks were set before
them: and they ate and drank till they became
satisfied and cheerful: all except Deirdre and the
Sons of Usna, who did not partake much of food or
drink. And Naisi asked for the king's chessboard
and chessmen; which were brought: and he and
Deirdre began to play.


XIV.

TROUBLE LOOMING.

Let us now speak of Concobar. As he sat among
his nobles, the thought of Deirdre came into his
mind, and he said:&mdash;"Who among you will go to the
Red Branch and bring me tidings of Deirdre,
whether her youthful shape and looks still live upon
her: for if so there is not on the ridge of the world
a woman more beautiful." And Lavarcam said she
would go.
[Pg 73]

Now the Sons of Usna were very dear to
Lavarcam: and Naisi was dearer than the others.
And rising up she went to the Red Branch,
where she found Naisi and Deirdre with the
chessboard between them, playing. And she saluted
them affectionately: and she embraced Deirdre, and
wept over her, and kissed her many times with the
eagerness of her love: and she kissed the cheeks of
Naisi and of his brothers.

And when her loving greeting was ended, she
said:&mdash;"Beloved children, evil is the deed that is to
be done this night in Emain: for the three torches of
valour of the Gaels will be treacherously assailed,
and Concobar is certainly resolved to put them to
death. And now set your people on guard, and bolt
and bar all doors, and close all windows; and be
steadfast and valourous, and defend your dear charge
manfully, if you may hold the assailants at bay
till Fergus comes." And she departed weeping
piteously.

And when Lavarcam had returned to Concobar
asked what tidings she brought. "Good tidings have
I," said she: "for the three Sons of Usna have come,
the three valiant champions of Ulaid: and now that
they are with thee, O king, thou wilt hold sway in
Erin without dispute. And bad tidings I bring also:
Deirdre indeed is not as she was, for her youthful
form and the splendour of her countenance have fled
from her."
[Pg 74]

And when Concobar heard this his jealousy abated,
and he joined in the feasting.

But again the thought of Deirdre came to him,
and he asked:&mdash;"Who now will go for me to the
Red Branch and bring me further tidings of Deirdre
and of the Sons of Usna?" for he distrusted
Lavarcam. But the Knights of the Red Branch
had misgivings of some evil design, and all remained
silent.

Then he called to him Trendorn, one of the lesser
chiefs: and he said:&mdash;"Knowest thou, Trendorn, who
slew thy father and thy three brothers in battle?"
And Trendorn answered:&mdash;"Verily, it was Naisi the
son of Usna that slew them." Then the king
said:&mdash;"Go now to the Red Branch and bring me
back tidings of Deirdre and of the Sons of Usna."

Trendorn went right willingly. But when he
found the doors and windows of the Red Branch
shut up, he was seized with fear, and he said: "It is
not safe to approach the Sons of Usna, for they are
surely in wrathful mood: nevertheless I must needs
bring back tidings to the king."

Whereupon, not daring to knock at the door, he
climbed nimbly to a small window high up that had
been unwittingly left open, through which he viewed
the spacious banquet hall, and saw Naisi and
Deirdre playing chess. Deirdre chanced to look up
at that moment, and seeing the face of the spy with
eyes intently gazing on her, she started with affright
[Pg 75]
and grasped Naisi's arm, as he was making a move
with the chessman. Naisi, following her gaze, and
seeing the evil-looking face, flung the chessman with
unerring aim and broke the eye in Trendorn's head.

Trendorn dropped down in pain and rage; and
going straight to Concobar, he said:&mdash;"I have
tidings for thee, O king: the three Sons of Usna are
sitting in the banquet hall, stately and proud like
kings: and Deirdre is seated beside Naisi; and
verily, for beauty and queenly grace, her peer cannot
be found."

When Concobar heard this, a flame of jealousy
and fury blazed up in his heart, and he resolved that
by no means should the Sons of Usna escape the
doom he planned for them.


XV.

THE ATTACK ON THE SONS OF USNA.

Coming forth on the lawn of Emain, King Concobar
now ordered a large body of hireling troops to beset
the Red Branch: and he bade them force the doors
and bring forth the sons of Usna. And they uttered
three dreadful shouts of defiance, and assailed the
house on every side; but the strong oak stood
bravely, and they were not able to break through
doors or walls. So they heaped up great piles of
[Pg 76]
wood and brambles and kindled them till the red
flames blazed round the house.

Buinni the Red now stood up and said to the
Sons of Usna:&mdash;"To me be intrusted the task to
repel this first assault: for I am your pledge in
place of my father." And marshalling his men, and
causing the great door to be thrown wide open, he
sallied forth and scattered the assailants and put out
the fires: slaying thrice fifty hirelings in that
onslaught.

But Buinni returned not to the Red Branch:
for the king sent to him with a secret offer of great
favours and bribes: namely, his own royal friendship,
and a fruitful tract of land; which Buinni took and
basely abandoned the sons of Usna. But none the
better luck came to him of it: for at that same
hour a blight fell on the land, so that it became a
moor, waste and profitless, which is at this day
called Slieve Fuad.

When Illan the Fair became aware of his brother's
treason, he was grieved to the heart, and he said:&mdash;"I
am the second pledge in place of my father for
the sons of Usna, and of a certainty I will not betray
them: while this straight sword lives in my hand I
will be faithful: and I will now repel this second
attack." For at this time the king's hirelings were
again thundering at the doors.

Forth he issued with his band: and he made three
quick furious circuits round the Red Branch,
[Pg 77]
scattering the troops as he went: after which
he returned to the mansion and found Naisi and
Deirdre still playing.[26] But as the hireling hordes
returned to the attack, he went forth a second time
and fell on them, dealing death and havoc whither-soever
he went.

Then, while the fight was still raging, Concobar
called to him his son Ficra, and said to him:&mdash;"Thou
and Illan the Fair were born on the same night:
and as he has his father's arms, so thou take mine,
namely, my shield which is called the Ocean, and my
two spears which are called Dart and Slaughter, and
my great sword, the Blue-green blade. And bear
thyself manfully against him, and vanquish him, else
none of my troops will survive."

Ficra did so and went against Illan the Fair; and
they made a stout, warlike, red-wounding attack on
each other, while the others looked on anxious: but
none dared to interfere. And it came to pass that
Illan prevailed, so that Ficra was fain to shelter
himself behind his father's shield the Ocean, and
he was like to be slain. Whereupon the shield
moaned, and the Three Waves of Erin uttered their
hollow melancholy roar.[27]

[Pg 78]

The hero Conall Carnagh, sitting in his dun afar
off, heard the moan of the shield and the roar of the
Wave of Tuath: and springing up from where he
sat, he said: "Verily, the king is in danger: I will go
to his rescue."

He ran with the swiftness of the wind, and
arrived on the Green of Emain where the two young
heroes were fighting. Thinking it was Concobar
that crouched beneath the shield, he attacked Illan,
not knowing him, and wounded him even unto death.
And Illan looking up said, "Is it thou, Conall! Alas,
dreadful is the deed thou hast done, not knowing me,
and not knowing that I am fighting in defence of the
Sons of Usna who are now in deadly peril from the
treachery of Concobar."

And Conall, finding he had unwittingly wounded
his dear young friend Illan, turned in his grief and
rage on the other, and swept off his head. And he
stalked fierce and silent out of the battlefield.

Illan, still faithful to his charge, called aloud to
[Pg 79]
Naisi to defend himself bravely: then putting forth
his remaining strength, he flung his arms, namely,
his sword and his spears and his shield, into the
Red Branch; and falling prone on the green sward,
the shades of death dimmed his eyes, and his life
departed.

And now when it was the dusk of evening,
another great battalion of the hirelings assailed the
Red Branch, and kindled fagots around it: whereupon
Ardan sallied out with his valorous band and
scattered them, and put out the fires, and held guard
for the first third of the night. And during the
second third Ainnli kept them at bay.

Then Naisi took his turn, issuing forth, and fought
with them till the morning's dawn: and until the
sands of the seashore, or the leaves of the forest, or
the dew drops on the grass, or the stars of heaven are
counted, it will not be possible to number the
hirelings that were slain in that fight by Naisi and
his band of heroes.

And as he was returning breathless from the rout,
all grimy and terrible with blood and sweat, he spied
Lavarcam, as she stood watching the battle
anxiously; and he said:&mdash;"Go, Lavarcam, go and
stand on the outer rampart, and cast thine eyes
eastwards, if perchance thou shouldst see Fergus and
his men coming."

For many of Naisi's brave followers had fallen in
these encounters: and he doubted that he and the
[Pg 80]
others could sustain much longer the continual
assaults of superior numbers. And Lavarcam went,
but returned downcast, saying she saw nought
eastwards, but the open plain with the peaceful
herds browsing over it.


XVI.

DEATH OF THE SONS OF USNA.

Believing now that they could no longer defend the
Red Branch, Naisi took council with his brothers;
and what they resolved on was this:&mdash;To sally forth
with all their men and fight their way to a place of
safety. Then making a close firm fence of shields
and spears round Deirdre, they marched out in solid
ranks and attacked the hireling battalions and
slew three hundred in that onslaught.

Concobar, seeing the rout of his men, and being
now sure that it was not possible to subdue the Sons
of Usna in open fight, cast about if he might take
them by falsehood and craft. And sending for Caffa
the druid, who loved them, he said:&mdash;

"These sons of Usna are brave men, and it is our
pleasure to receive them back into our service. Go now
unto them, for thou art their loved friend; and say
to them that if they lay down their arms and submit
to me, I will restore them to favour and give them
[Pg 81]
their places among the Red Branch Knights. And I
pledge thee my kingly word and my troth as a true
knight, that no harm shall befal them."

Caffa, by no means distrusting him, went to the
Sons of Usna and told them all the king had said.
And they, suspecting neither guile nor treachery
joyfully threw their swords and spears aside, and
went towards the king to make submission. But
now, while they stood defenceless, the king caused
them to be seized and bound. Then, turning aside
he sought for some one to put them to death; but he
found no man of the Ultonians willing to do so.

Among his followers was a foreigner named Maini
of the Rough Hand, whose father and two brothers
had fallen in battle by Naisi: and this man undertook
to kill the Sons of Usna.

When they were brought forth to their doom,
Ardan said:&mdash;"I am the youngest: let me be slain
first that I may not see the death of my brothers."
And Ainnli earnestly pleaded for the same thing
for himself, saying that he was born before Ardan and
should die before him.

But Naisi said:&mdash;"Lo, I have a sword, the gift of
Mannanan Mac Lir, which leaves no remnant unfinished
after a blow: let us be struck with it, all
three together, and we shall die at the same moment."

This was agreed to: and the sword was brought
forth, and they laid their heads close together, and
Maini swept off all three with one blow of the mighty
[Pg 82]
sword. And when it became known that the Sons of
Usna were dead, the men of Ulaid sent forth three
great cries of grief and lamentation.

As for Deirdre, she cried aloud, and tore her golden
hair, and became like one distracted. And after a
time, when her calmness had a little returned, she
uttered a lament:&mdash;

I.

"Three lions of the hill are dead, and I am left
alone to weep for them. The generous princes who
made the stranger welcome have been guilefully lured
to their doom.

II.

"The three strong hawks of Slieve Cullinn,[28] a
king's three sons, strong and gentle: willing obedience
was yielded to them by heroes who had conquered
many lands.

III.

"Three generous heroes of the Red Branch, who
loved to praise the valour of others: three props of
the battalions of Quelna: their fall is the cause of
bitter grief.

IV.

"Ainnli and Ardan, haughty and fierce in battle,
to me were ever loving and gentle: Naisi, Naisi,
beloved spouse of my choice, thou canst not hear thy
Deirdre lamenting thee.
[Pg 83]

V.

"When they brought down the fleet red deer in the
chase, when they speared the salmon skilfully in the
clear water, joyful and proud were they if I looked
on.

VI.

"Often when my feeble feet grew weary wandering
along the valleys, and climbing the hills to view the
chase, often would they bear me home lightly on their
linked shields and spears.

VII.

"It was gladness of heart to be with the Sons of
Usna: long and weary is the day without their company:
short will be my span of life since they have
left me.

VIII.

"Sorrow and tears have dimmed my eyes, looking
at the grave of Naisi: a dark deadly sickness has
seized my heart: I cannot, I cannot live after Naisi.

IX.

"O, thou who diggest the new grave, make it deep
and wide: let it be a grave for four: for I will sleep
for ever beside my beloved."


When she had spoken these words, she fell beside
the body of Naisi and died immediately. And a great
[Pg 84]
cairn of stones was piled over their grave, and their
names were inscribed in Ogham, and their funeral
rites were performed.

This is the sorrowful tale of The Fate of the Sons
of Usna.


XVII.

AVENGING AND BRIGHT.


Avenging and bright fall the swift sword of Erin,
On him, who the brave sons of Usna betray'd!
For ev'ry fond eye he hath waken'd a tear in,
A drop from his heart-wounds shall weep o'er her blade.

By the red cloud that hung over Connor's dark dwelling,
When Ulad's three champions lay sleeping in gore&mdash;
By the billows of war which, so often high swelling,
Have wafted these heroes to victory's shore?

We swear to revenge them!&mdash;no joy shall be tasted,
The harp shall be silent, the maiden unwed,
Our halls shall be mute, and our fields shall lie wasted,
Till vengeance is wreak'd on the murderer's head.
[Pg 85]
Yes, monarch! though sweet are our home recollections,
Though sweet are the tears that from tenderness fall;
Though sweet are our friendships, our hopes, our affections,
Revenge[29] on a tyrant is sweetest of all!

Thomas Moore.



XVIII.

THE WRATH OF FERGUS MAC ROY.

Barach's banquet was ended. Fergus, anxious and
impatient, returned with his people to Emain. And
when he found that the sons of Usna had been slain
in violation of his pledge, and that his son, Illan the
Fair, had fallen while defending them, his grief and
wrath knew no bounds. Caffa the druid was none
the less incensed; and he was in sore anguish: for
he it was, who, trusting in Concobar's deceitful
promises, persuaded the sons of Usna to give up
their arms and yield. And he pronounced the doom
of Concobar's race, that neither he nor any of his
descendants should reign in Emain thenceforward
for evermore.
[Pg 86]

And these two, Fergus and Caffa, collecting their
men of valour, spoiled and laid waste Concobar's
territory; till at last a battle was fought between
them, in which the king was defeated, and three
hundred of his bravest Ultonians were slain, besides
his son and many other illustrious persons in his
service. Fergus and Caffa then attacked Emain, and
burned and pillaged it, and slew those who defended
it. And though the palace was rebuilt in due time,
and continued to be the residence of the kings of
Ulaid for more than three hundred years afterwards,
none of Concobar's descendants possessed it, as Caffa
had foretold.



Bronze celts. A celt was a sort of battle axe; sometimes made of
bronze, sometimes of stone. The right hand figure shows how the
bronze head was fixed to the handle. Great numbers of these celts of
many different shapes, both stone and bronze, are preserved in the
National Museum, Dublin.


After this, Fergus and other great champions of the
Red Branch, with three thousand warriors, marched
[Pg 87]
into Connaught, where Ailell and Maive, king and
queen of that province, being at war with Concobar,
welcomed them and took them gladly into their
service. And for seven years they continued to send
marauding parties to spoil and ravage the province
of Ulaid, so that many battles were fought, and
many heroes were slain. In the stories of this war
we read much of the mighty champion Cuculainn
who was the chief defender of Ulaid against Ailell
and Maive's forces.

ANCIENT IRISH PHYSICIANS: Part I.

Among most nations of old times there were great
leeches or physicians, who were considered so skilful
that the people believed they could cure wounds and
ailments as if by magic. In some countries they
became gods, as among the Greeks.

The ancient Irish people, too, had their mighty
leech, a Dedannan named Dianket, who, as they
believed, could heal all wounds and cure all diseases;
so that he became the Irish God of Medicine. He
had a son, Midac, and a daughter, Armedda, who
were both as good as himself; and at last Midac
became so skilful that his father killed him in a fit
of jealousy. And, after some time, there grew up
[Pg 88]
from the young doctor's grave 365 herbs, each
with virtue to cure some particular ailment. His
sister Armedda plucked up these herbs, and carefully
sorting them, wrapped them up in her mantle. But
the jealous old Dianket came and mixed them all up,
so that no one could distinguish them: and but for
this&mdash;according to the legend&mdash;every physician would
now be able to cure all diseases without delay, by
selecting and applying the proper herbs.

Leaving these shadowy old-world stories, let us come
down to historic times, when we shall, as it were,
tread on solid ground. From the very earliest times
medicine and surgery were carefully studied in
Ireland: and there was a distinct class of professional
medical doctors, who underwent a course of education
and practical training. A young man usually
learned to be a physician by apprenticeship, i.e. by
living in the house of a regular physician, and accompanying
him on his visits to patients to learn his
methods of treatment.

A king or a great chief had always a physician as
part of his household, to attend to the health of his
family. The usual remuneration of these men was a
residence and a tract of land in the neighbourhood,
free of all rent and taxes, together with certain
allowances: and the medical man might, if he chose,
practise for fee outside the household. Some of those
in the service of great kings had castles, and lived in
state like princes. Those not so attached lived on
[Pg 89]
their fees, like many doctors of the present day:
and the fees for the various operations or attendances
were laid down in the Brehon Law.[30]

Though medical doctors were looked up to with
great respect, they had to be very careful in exercising
their profession. A leech who through carelessness,
or wilful neglect, or gross want of skill,
failed to cure a wound, might be brought before a
brehon or judge, and if the case was proved home
against him, he had to pay the same fine to the
patient, as if he had inflicted the wound with his
own hand.


XX.

ANCIENT IRISH PHYSICIANS: Part II.

Medicine, as a profession, like Law, History, &amp;c., often
ran in families in Ireland, descending regularly from
father to son; and several Irish families were distinguished
leeches for generations, such as the O'Shiels,
the O'Cassidys, the O'Hickeys, and the O'Lees.

Each medical family kept a book, which was
handed down reverently from father to son, and
in which was written, in Irish or Latin, all the
medical knowledge derived either from other books
or from the actual experience of the various members
[Pg 90]
of the family; and many of these old volumes, all in
beautiful handwriting, are still preserved in Dublin
and elsewhere. As showing the admirable spirit in
which those good men studied and practised their
profession, and how much they loved it, it is worth
while to give a translation of the opening statement,
a sort of preface, in the Irish language, written at the
beginning of one of these books, in the year 1352.

"May the good God have mercy on us all. I
have here collected practical rules of medicine from
several works, for the honour of God, for the benefit
of the Irish people, for the instruction of my pupils,
and for the love of my friends and of my kindred. I
have translated many of them into Gaelic from
Latin books, containing the lore of the great leeches
of Greece and Rome. These are sweet and profitable
things which have been often tested by us and by our
instructors.

"I pray God to bless those doctors who will use
this book; and I lay it as an injunction on their
souls, that they extract knowledge from it not by
any means sparingly, and that they do not neglect
the practical rules herein contained. More especially
I charge them that they do their duty devotedly in
cases where they receive no payment on account of
the poverty of their patients.

"Let every physician, before he begins his treatment,
offer up a secret prayer for the sick person,
and implore the heavenly Father, the Physician and
[Pg 91]
Balm-giver of all mankind, to prosper the work he
is entering upon, and to save himself and his patient
from failure."

There is good reason to believe that the noble
sentiments here expressed were generally those of
the physicians of the time; from which we may see
that the old Irish medical doctors were quite as devoted
to their profession, as eager for knowledge, and as
anxious about their patients as those of the present
day.

The fame of the Irish physicians reached the continent.
Even at a comparatively late time, about
three hundred years ago, when medicine had been
successfully studied and practised in Ireland for
more than a thousand years, a well-known and distinguished
physician of Brussels,[31] in a book written
by him in Latin on medical subjects, praises the
Irish doctors, and describes them correctly as follows:&mdash;

"In the household of every great lord in Ireland
there is a physician who has a tract of land for his
support, and who is appointed to his post, not on
account of the great amount of learning he brings
away in his head from colleges, but because he is able
to cure diseases. His knowledge of the healing art
is derived from books left him by his forefathers,
which describe very exactly the marks and signs by
which the various diseases are known, and lay down
[Pg 92]
the proper remedies for each. These remedies,
[which are mostly herbs], are all produced in that
country. Accordingly, the Irish people are much
better managed in sickness than the Italians, who
have a physician in every village."

It is pleasant to know that the Irish physicians of
our time who, it is generally agreed, are equal to
those of any other country in the world, can look
back with respect, and not without some feeling of
pride, to their Irish predecessors of the times of old.


XXI.

THE FENA OF ERIN.

In the third century of the Christian era lived the
Fena[32] of Erin, a famous body of warriors something
like the Red Branch Knights of an older time. Their
most renowned commander was Finn Mac Cumaill
[Cool], King Cormac Mac Art's son-in-law, who of
all the heroes of ancient Ireland is at the present
day best remembered in tradition by the people.

Finn had his chief residence on the Hill of Allen, a
remarkable flat-topped hill lying about four miles to
the right of the railway as you pass from Newbridge
towards Kildare, which will be at once recognised
by a tall pillar erected fifty or sixty years ago on
[Pg 93]
the top, on the very site of Finn's palace. There
are now very little remains of the palace-fort,
which, there is good reason to believe, was at no
time very large. Whatever remained of it has been
cleared away, partly to make room for the pillar, and
partly by cultivation, for the land has been tilled
and cropped to the very summit. The whole neighbourhood
however still teems with living traditions
of the heroes; and the people all round the hill tell
many stories of Finn and the Fena, and point out
the several spots they frequented. As in the case of
the Red Branch Knights, there were Fena in all the
provinces, each provincial troop under a leader. The
Fena of Erin flourished for many generations; but
they reached their greatest glory under Finn in the
time of Cormac Mac Art, who was king of Ireland
from A.D. 254 to 277.

No man was admitted to their ranks till he had
proved his strength and activity by passing severe
tests in leaping, running, and defending himself from
attack against great odds. They should be educated
in the sort of learning in vogue at the time, and
especially they should be able to repeat many verses
and stories recounting the great deeds of the times of
old, so that they might learn to admire all that was
brave and noble, and that in time of peace they
might be bright and entertaining at banquets and
other festive gatherings. They were all mighty men
in fight, brave, and strong, and swift of foot: and
[Pg 94]
they were above all things bound to be honourable
and truthful in their dealings, and to protect the
weak&mdash;particularly women and children&mdash;from
oppression and wrong.

The Fena loved open-air games and exercises of all
kinds, especially the chase. They had a breed of
enormous dogs of which they were very fond, gentle
and affectionate at home, but fierce and terrible in
the chase; and from Beltane (1st of May) to Samin
(1st November) they hunted deer, wild boars, and
other game through the forests, and over the hills,
glens, and plains. Though the chief men among
them rode on horseback when travelling long distances
from one district to another, they always
hunted on foot, never using horses in the chase.
During hunting time they camped out at night,
living on the flesh of the animals they brought down
and on the wild fruit and herbs of the forest.

At midday, whatever game they had killed during
the morning they sent by their attendants to the place
appointed for the evening meal, which was always
chosen near a wood and beside a stream or lake.
The attendants roasted one part on hazel spits
before immense fires of wood, and baked the rest
on hot stones in a pit dug in the earth. The stones
were heated in the fires. At the bottom of the pit
the men placed a layer of these hot stones: then
a layer of meat-joints wrapped in sedge to keep them
from being burned: next another layer of hot stones:
[Pg 95]
down on that more meat; and so on till the whole
was disposed of. When the hunters returned, their
first care was to bathe, so as to remove the sweat and
mire of the chase. Then they attended to their hair:
for they wore the hair long, and were very particular
about combing, dressing, and plaiting it. By the
time their preparations were completed, the meat
was ready: and the hungry hunters sat down to
their smoking-hot savoury meal.

After the meal they set up their tents, and each
man prepared his bed. He first put down a thick layer
of brushwood from the surrounding forest; on that
he spread a quantity of moss; and on that again a
layer of fresh rushes, on which he slept soundly after
his day of joyous, healthful toil. In the old tales
these three materials&mdash;brushwood, moss, and rushes&mdash;are
called the "Three beddings of the Fena."[33]

[Pg 96]

The Fena were in the service of the kings, and
their main duties were to uphold justice and put
down oppression and wrong, to suppress robbers and
other evil-doers, to exact fines and tributes for the
king, and to guard the harbours of the country against
pirates and invaders. For these services they received
a fixed pay: during the six months hunting season,
their pay was merely the animals they killed, of
which they used the flesh for food and sold the skins.

An Irish poet of our day has written of the Milesian
people in general, including those Fena of Erin
and the Red Branch Knights:&mdash;


"Long, long ago, beyond the misty space
Of twice a thousand years,
In Erin old there dwelt a mighty race
Taller than Roman spears;
Like oaks and towers they had a giant grace,
Were fleet as deers,
With winds and wave they made their biding place,
Those western shepherd seers.

Great were their deeds, their passions, and their sports.
With clay and stone,
They piled on strath and shore those mystic forts,
Not yet o'erthrown:
On cairn-crowned hills they held their council-courts;
While youths alone,
With giant dogs explored the elk resorts
And brought them down."


[Pg 97]

In many modern stories, Finn is spoken of as a
giant; but this is a vulgar notion. The old romantic
tales describe him as a tall, strong man, though not a
giant; with much keen wit, sound sense, and great
judgment: and though he was a mighty champion,
he ruled his men more by wisdom, kindness, and
justice, than by strength. When quite a young man
his hair became white like silver: how this happened
will be told in the next story. Oisin [Isheen] or
Ossian, the renowned hero-poet of the Fena, was his
son. Oscar the son of Ossian was youthful, comely,
kind-hearted, and valiant. Dermot O'Dyna was the
handsomest of all these heroes. He was unconquerably
brave, of untarnished honour, generous, and
self-denying, ever ready to take the post of danger,
always giving credit to others, and never in the least
boasting of his own deeds. He is the finest character
of all the Fena; and it would be hard to find his
[Pg 98]
equal in the ancient tales of any country. We have
a vast number of beautiful stories in the Irish
language about Finn and the other heroes of the
Fena, a few of which are translated in this book.


XXII.

THE CHASE OF SLIEVE CULLINN.

In which Ossian relates how Finn's Hair was
changed in one Day from the Colour of Gold
to Silvery Grey.

On a morning in summer, Finn happened to be
walking alone on the lawn before the palace of Allen,
when a doe sprang out from a thicket, and, passing
quite close to him, bounded past like the wind.
Without a moment's delay, he signalled for his companions
and dogs; but none heard except his two
hounds, Bran and Skolan. He instantly gave chase,
accompanied only by his two dogs; and before the
Fena knew of his absence, he had left Allen of the
green slopes far behind.

The chase turned northwards; and though the
hounds kept close to the doe, the chief kept quite as
close to the hounds the whole way. And so they
continued without rest or pause, till they reached
Slieve Cullinn, far in the north.
[Pg 99]

Here the doe made a sudden turn and disappeared;
and Finn never caught sight of her after. And he
marvelled much that any doe in the world should be
able to lead Bran and Skolan so long a chase, and
escape from them in the end. Meantime they kept
searching, Finn taking one side of the hill and the
dogs another, so that he was at last left quite alone.

While he was wandering about the hill and whistling
for his hounds, he heard the plaintive cry of a
woman at no great distance; and, turning his steps
towards the place, he saw a beautiful young lady
sitting on the brink of a little lake, weeping as if her
heart would break. Finn accosted her; and, seeing
that she ceased her weeping for a moment, he asked
her had she seen his two hounds pass that way.

"I have not seen thy hounds," she replied, "nor
have I been at all concerned in the chase; for, alas,
there is something that troubles me more nearly. I
had a precious gold bracelet on my hand, which
I prized beyond anything in the world; and it has
fallen from me into the water. I saw it roll down
the steep slope at the bottom, till it went quite out
of my sight. This is the cause of my sorrow, and
thou canst remedy the mishap if thou wilt. The
Fena are sworn never to refuse help to a woman in
distress; and I now put it on thee to search for
this bracelet, and cease not till thou find it and
restore it to me."

Finn plunged in without a moment's hesitation;
[Pg 100]
and after swimming three times round the lake,
diving and searching into every nook and cranny
at the bottom, he found the bracelet at last; and
approaching the lady, he handed it to her from the
water. The moment she had got it she sprang into
the lake before his eyes, and, diving down, disappeared
in an instant.

and workmanship, and weighs 3&frac34; oz.


The chief, wondering greatly at this strange
behaviour, stepped forth from the water; but as
soon as his feet had touched the dry land, he lost all
his strength, and fell on the brink, a withered, grey
old man, shrunken up and trembling all over with
weakness. He sat him down in woful plight; and
soon his hounds came up. They looked at him wistfully
and sniffed and whined around him; but they
knew him not, and, passing on, they ran round the
lake, searching in vain for their master.
[Pg 101]

On that day we and the Fena in general were
assembled in the banquet hall of the palace of Allen;
some feasting, some playing chess, and others listening
to the sweet music of the harpers. While all were
in this wise pleasantly engaged, we suddenly missed
our chief, and when we searched for him he was
nowhere to be found: whereupon we became alarmed.
Inquiring now from the lesser people about the
palace, we found that the chief and his two dogs
had chased a doe northwards. So, having mustered
a strong party of the Fena, we started in pursuit,
and following the track, never slackened speed till
we reached Slieve Cullinn.

We began to search round the hill, and after wandering
among brakes and rough, rocky places, we at
last espied a grey-headed old man sitting on the
brink of a lake. I went up to him, followed by the
rest of the Fena, and asked him if he had seen a
noble-looking hero pass that way, with two hounds,
chasing a doe. He never answered a word, neither
did he stir from where he sat, or even look up; but
at the question, his head sank on his breast, and his
limbs shook all over as with palsy. Then he fell into
a sudden fit of grief, wringing his hands and uttering
feeble cries of woe.

We soothed him and used him gently, hoping he
might speak at last; but to no purpose, for he only
lamented the more, and still answered nothing.

At last, after this had gone on for some time, and
[Pg 102]
when we were about to leave him, he told us in a
whisper the dreadful secret; and then we all came to
know the truth. When we found that the withered
old man was no other than our beloved king, Finn
himself, we uttered three shouts of lamentation and
anger, so loud and prolonged that the foxes and
badgers rushed affrighted from their dens in the
hollows of the mountain.

When quietness was restored, we asked Finn how
this dread evil had befallen him; and he told us that
it was the daughter of Culann the smith who had
transformed him by her spells. And then he recounted
how she had lured him to swim in the lake,
and how, when he came forth, he was turned into a
withered old man.

We now made a framework litter of slender poles,
and, placing our king on it, we lifted him tenderly
on our shoulders. And, turning from the lake, we
marched slowly up-hill till we came to the fairy
palace of Slieve Cullinn, where we knew the daughter
of Culann had her dwelling deep under ground. Here
we set him down, and the whole troop began at once
to dig, determined to find the enchantress in her
cave-palace, and force her to restore our chief.

For three days and three nights we dug, without a
moment's rest or pause, till at length we reached her
hollow dwelling; when she, affrighted at the tumult
and at the vengeful look of the heroes, suddenly
started forth from the cave and stood before us. She
[Pg 103]
held in her hand a drinking-horn of red gold, which
she handed to the king and told him to drink. No
sooner had he drunk from it, than his own shape and
features returned, save only that his hair remained of
a silvery grey.

When we gazed on our chief in his own graceful
and manly form, we were all pleased with the soft,
silvery hue of the grey hairs. And, though the enchantress
appeared ready to restore this also, Finn
himself told her that it pleased him as it pleased the
others, and that he chose to remain grey for the rest
of his life.

SAINT BRIGIT: Part I.

Of all the Irish saints, Brigit and Columkille are,
next after St. Patrick, the most loved and revered by
the people of Ireland.
[Pg 104]

Like many others of our early saints, Brigit
came of a noble family. Her father Dubthach
[Duffa] was a distinguished Leinster chief, descended
from the kings of Ireland. For some reason,
which we do not know, he and his wife lived
for a time in Faughart near Dundalk, which was
then a part of Ulster: and at Faughart Brigit was
born about the year 455. The family must have
soon returned however to their own district, for we
know that Brigit passed her childhood with her
parents in the neighbourhood of Kildare. She was
baptised, and carefully instructed and trained, both
in general education and in religion: for her father
and mother were Christians. As she grew up,
her quiet, gentle, modest ways pleased all that knew
her. At the time of her birth, St. Patrick was
in the midst of his glorious career; and some
say that while she was still a child she knew him,
and that when he died she made with her own hands
a winding sheet in which his body was laid in the
grave; which may have happened, as she was ten or
twelve years of age at the time of his death.

When Brigit came of an age to choose her way of
life, she resolved to be a nun, to which her parents
made no objection. After due preparation she went
to a holy bishop of the neighbourhood, who, at her
request, received her, and placed a white robe on her
shoulders and a white veil over her head. Here she
remained for some time in companionship with eight
[Pg 105]
other maidens who had been received with her, and
who placed themselves under her guidance. As
time went on, she became so beloved for her piety
and sweetness of disposition, that many young
women asked to be admitted; so that though she by
no means desired that people should be speaking in
her praise, the fame of her little community began
to spread through the country.

This first establishment was conducted strictly
under a set of Rules drawn up by Brigit herself:
and now, bishops in various parts of Ireland began
to apply to her to establish convents in their several
districts under the same rules. She was glad of this,
and she did what she could to meet their wishes.
She visited Longford, Tipperary, Limerick, South
Leinster, and Roscommon, one after another; and
in all these places she founded convents.

At last the people of her own province of Leinster,
considering that they had the best right to her
services, sent a number of leading persons to request
that she would fix her permanent residence among
them. She was probably pleased to go back to live
in the place where she had spent her childhood; and
she returned to Leinster, where she was welcomed
with great joy. The Leinster people gave her a
piece of land chosen by herself, on the edge of a
beautiful level grassy plain, well known as the
Curragh of Kildare. Here, on a low ridge over-looking
the plain, she built a little church, under the
[Pg 106]
shade of a wide-spreading oak tree, whence it got the
name of Kill-dara, the Church of the Oak, or as we
now call it, Kildare. This tree continued to flourish
long after Brigit's death, and it was regarded with
great veneration by the people of the place. A
writer of the tenth century&mdash;four hundred years
after the foundation of the church&mdash;tells us that
in his time it was a mere branchless, withered
trunk; but the people had such reverence for it
that no one dared to cut or chip it.

We are not quite sure of the exact year of Brigit's
settlement here; but it probably occurred about 485,
when she was thirty years of age. Hard by the
church she also built a dwelling for herself and her
community. We are told, in the Irish Life of St.
Brigit, that this first house was built of wood, like
the houses of the people in general: and the little
church under the oak was probably of wood also,
like most churches of the time. As the number
of applicants for admission continued to increase,
both church and dwelling had to be enlarged from
time to time; and the wood was replaced by stone
and mortar. Such was the respect in which the
good abbess was held, that visitors came from all
parts of the country to see her and ask her advice
and blessing: and many of them settled down in
the place, so that a town gradually grew up near
the convent, which was the beginning of the town
of Kildare.


[Pg 107]
XXIV.

SAINT BRIGIT: Part II.

Brigit, although now at the head of a great
community, and very strict in carrying out her
Rules, still retained all her humility and gentleness
of disposition. With such a large family, there was
plenty of work to do; and it was all done by the
nuns, as they kept no servants and called in no
outsiders. The abbess herself, so far as she was
able to withdraw from the cares of governing the
establishment, took her part like the rest in most of
the domestic occupations. In some of the old
accounts of her life we are told that she often,
with some companions, herded and tended her flocks
of sheep that grazed on the level sward round the
convent. And sometimes she was caught by the
heavy rain-squalls that occasionally sweep across
that shelterless plain, so that her clothes were wet
through by the time she returned to the convent:
showing that she took her own share of the rough
work.

Not far from the convent, another establishment
was founded, later on, for men, which afterwards
became one of the great Colleges of Ireland. As
the two communities and the population of the
town continued to grow, it was Brigit's earnest
[Pg 108]
desire that a bishop should be there to take spiritual
charge of the whole place. A holy man named
Conleth, who had hitherto spent his life as a hermit
in the neighbourhood, was appointed bishop by the
heads of the Church. He was the first bishop of
Kildare, and he took up his residence in the
monastery. The name of that good bishop is to
this day held in affectionate remembrance, with
that of St. Brigit, by the people of Kildare and of
the country all round.

While the parent convent at Kildare continued
to grow, branch houses under Brigit's Rule, and
subject to her authority, were established all over
[Pg 109]
Ireland; and many establishments for monks were
also founded in honour of her.

Brigit had such a reputation for wisdom and
prudence, that the most eminent of the saints, and
many kings and chiefs of her day, visited Kildare
or corresponded with her, to obtain her advice in
doubtful or difficult matters. Visitors were constantly
coming and going, all of whom she received
kindly and treated hospitably. All this, with daily
alms to the needy, and the support of a large
community, kept her poor: for the produce of her
land was not nearly sufficient to supply her wants.
For a long time in the beginning she and her
community suffered from downright poverty, so
that she had often to call on the charity of her
friends and neighbours to assist her. But as time
went on, and as the reputation of the place spread
abroad, she received many presents from rich people,
which generally came in the right time, and enabled
her to carry on her establishment without any
danger of want.

Among Brigit's virtues none is more marked than
her charity and kindness of heart towards poor,
needy, and helpless people. She never could look
on distress of any kind without trying to relieve
it at whatever cost. Even when a mere girl living
with her parents, her father was often displeased
with her for giving away necessary things belonging
to the house to poor people who came in their
[Pg 110]
misery to beg from her. It happened on one occasion
that her father drove her in his chariot to Naas
(in Kildare), where then lived Dunlang king of Leinster;
and dismounting, he entered the palace, leaving
his sword behind&mdash;a beautiful and valuable one&mdash;while
Brigit remained in charge of horse and chariot.
A wretched looking poor man with sickness and
want in his face came up and begged for some relief.
Overcome with pity she looked about for something
to give him, and finding nothing but the sword, she
handed it to him. On her father's return he fell into
a passion at the loss of his sword: and when King
Dunlang questioned her reproachfully, she replied:&mdash;"If
I had all thy wealth I would give it to the poor;
for giving to the poor is giving to the Lord of the
Universe." And the king turning to the father said:&mdash;"It
is not meet that either you or I should chide
this maiden, for her merit is greater before God than
before men": on which the matter ended: and
Brigit returned home with her father.

Her overflowing kindness of heart was not
confined to human beings: it extended even to
the lower animals. Once while she lived in her
father's house, a party of guests were invited, and
she was given some pieces of meat to cook for
dinner. And a poor miserable half-starved hound
limped into the house and looked longingly at the
meat: whereupon the girl, quite unable to overcome
her feeling of pity, threw him one of the pieces.
[Pg 111]
And when the poor animal, in his hungry greediness,
had devoured that in a moment, she gave him
another, which satisfied him. And to the last day of
her life she retained her tenderness of heart and her
kindness and charity towards the poor.


XXV.

SAINT BRIGIT: Part III.

Late in life Brigit's influence over young people was
unbounded: for her very gentleness gave tenfold
power to her words. Once, seeing a young man, a
student of the neighbouring college, running very
violently and in an unbecoming manner, in presence
of some of her nuns, she sent for him on the spot
and asked him why he was running in such haste.
He replied thoughtlessly, and half in jest, that he
was running to heaven: on which she said quietly:
"I wish to God, my dear son, that I was worthy to
run with you to-day to the same place: I beg you
will pray for me to help me to arrive there." And
when he heard these words, and looked on her grave
kind face, he was greatly moved; and telling her
with tears in his eyes, that he would surely pray for
her and for many others besides, he besought her to
offer up her prayers for him, that he might continue
his journey steadily towards heaven, and arrive there
[Pg 112]
in the end. That young man, whose name was
Ninnius, became in after-life one of the most revered
of the Irish saints.

But with all her gentle unassuming ways, St.
Brigit was a woman of strong mind and great
talents. She not only governed her various establishments
in strict accordance with her own Rules and
forms of discipline, but she was a powerful aid in
forwarding the mighty religious movement that had
been commenced by St. Patrick half a century
before. She set an illustrious example to those
Irish women who, during and after her time, entered
on a religious life; and though many of them
became distinguished saints, she stands far above
them all. No writer has left us a detailed account of
her last hours, as Adamnan has done for St. Columkille.
(See page 150, note, farther on.) We only
know that she died at Kildare on the first of February,
in or about the year 523, and that she received the
last consolations of religion from the grateful hand
of that same Ninnius whom she had turned to a
religious life many years before.

She was buried in Kildare, where her body was
entombed in a magnificent shrine, ornamented with
gold, silver, and precious stones. We may be sure it
was a very beautiful work of art, for we know that
there was a noted school of metal workers in Kildare
under the direction of St. Conleth, who was himself
a most skilful artist; but this tomb was plundered
[Pg 113]
by the Danes three hundred years afterwards, and
not a trace of it now remains.

According to some accounts, the bones of St.
Brigit and St. Columkille were brought to
Downpatrick many centuries after the death of both,
and buried in the same tomb with the remains of
St. Patrick. Whether this was so or not, the matter
has been commemorated in a Latin verse, of which
the following is a translation:&mdash;


"Interred beneath one tomb in Down, a single vault doth hold
Patrick and Brigit and Columkille, three holy saints of old."


A well known Welshman, Gerald Barry (Giraldus
Cambrensis), who was in Ireland in 1185, and who
wrote an account of it, says that he found "at
Kildare in Leinster, celebrated for the glorious
Brigit, the 'Fire of St. Brigit' which is reported
never to go out." This fire was kept up day and
night by the nuns in his time, and for centuries
before&mdash;how long no one can tell&mdash;probably from
the time of the saint herself&mdash;and was continued
for centuries after: but it was finally extinguished
when the monasteries were closed up by Henry
VIII. in the year 1536. Thomas Moore, in one of
his songs, refers to it in the following words:&mdash;


"Like the bright lamp that shone in Kildare's holy fane,
And burned through long ages of darkness and storm."


[Pg 114]
St. Brigit is venerated in England and Scotland as
well as in Ireland: for in both these countries
churches were built in her honour, and many
convents were established under her name and rule.
She was also well known and honoured on the
Continent. We need not wonder that her life has
been written by many Irishmen: but English,
Scotch, French, Italian, and German writers have
also written about her and have commemorated her
as one of the most eminent saints of the West.

Convents and monasteries were maintained in
Kildare for hundreds of years after the time of St.
Brigit; and "Kildare's holy fane" is still venerated
as much as ever. On the very ridge where the
humble little church was erected fourteen hundred
years ago, there is a group of fine old church buildings,
with a tall round tower that overlooks the
splendid plain of Kildare.


XXVI.

IRISH SCRIBES AND BOOKS.

In old times all books were handwritten, printing
being a late invention. There were persons called
Scribes, many of whom made writing the chief
business of their lives. From constant practice they
[Pg 115]
became very expert; and the penmanship of many of
them was extremely beautiful and highly ornamented,
much more so than any writing executed by the very
best penmen of the present day.

In Ireland, most of these scribes were monks, inmates
of monasteries; but many were laymen. These
good and industrious men wrote into their books all
the learning of every kind that they could collect;
so that although the work of writing was slow, the
numbers of books rapidly increased; and very large
libraries grew up, especially in the monasteries. The
leaves of these books were not paper like those of our
books, but parchment or vellum, which was generally
made from sheepskin, but often from the skins of
other animals.

Sometimes the scribes wrote down what had never
been written before, that is, matters composed at the
time, or preserved in memory: but more commonly
they copied from other volumes. If an old book began
to be worn, ragged, or dim with age, so as to be
hard to make out and read, some scribe was sure to
copy it, so as to have a new book easy to read
and well bound up. Most of the books written out
in this manner related to Ireland, as will be described
presently; and the language of these was almost
always Irish. For in those times the Irish language
was spoken by all the people of Ireland.

A favourite occupation was copying portions of the
Holy Scriptures, nearly always in the Latin language;
[Pg 116]
and in this good work some monks spent nearly all
their time, in order to multiply copies of the sacred
books. Some of the greatest saints of the ancient
Irish Church employed themselves in copying the
Gospels and other portions of the Bible, whenever
they could get the opportunity, as we shall see in
the case of St. Columkille.

Copies of the Scriptures, and also prayer books,
were generally ornamented in the most beautiful
way: for those accomplished and devoted old scribes
loved to beautify the sacred writings. Many of the
lovely books they wrote are still preserved, of
which the most splendid is the Book of Kells, now
kept in the Library of Trinity College, in Dublin.
It is a copy of the Four Gospels, and the language is
Latin, though the letters are Irish. It was written
by an Irish scribe eleven or twelve hundred years
ago, but who he was is not known.

There is no old book in any part of the world so
skilfully ornamented as this. The capital letters are
very large&mdash;one of them fills an entire page&mdash;and are
all illuminated, that is, painted in brilliant colours;
and after the lapse of so many centuries the colours
are still very fresh, though not so bright as when
they were first laid on.

In this Book of Kells, and in others like it,
the capitals are ornamented in every part with a
kind of interlaced work, all done with the pen, in
which bands and ribbons are curved and plaited and
[Pg 117]
woven in the most wonderful way. These plaits and
folds are so small and so close together that one
must sometimes use a magnifying glass in order to
see them plainly: in one space, the size of a half
penny, in a page of a splendid old volume, called
the Book of Armagh, the ribbons appear woven in
and out more than three hundred times.

A specimen of this interwoven ornamental work
is seen at the head of the first page of this book;
but it gives only a poor idea of the beauty of the
Book of Kells. The frontispiece of the "Child's
History of Ireland" is a perfect copy, in full colours,
of a complete page of the Book of Mac Durnan,
which is almost as beautiful as the Book of Kells.
The Irish used this sort of ornamentation also in
metal-work and stone-work, of which an example
is given here.

Very often, large volumes were kept, into which
were written compositions of all kinds, both prose
and poetry, such as were thought worth preserving,
copied from older books, and written in, one after
[Pg 118]
another, till the volume was filled. Of all these
old books of mixed compositions, the largest that
remains to us is the Book of Leinster, which is kept
in Trinity College in Dublin. It is an immense
volume, all in the Irish language, written more than
750 years ago; and many of the pages are now
almost black with age and very hard to make out.
It contains a great number of pieces, some in prose
and some in verse, and nearly all of them about
Ireland&mdash;histories, accounts of battles and sieges,
lives and adventures of great men, with many tales
and stories of things that happened in this country
in far distant ages.

The Book of the Dun Cow is preserved in the
Royal Irish Academy in Dublin. It is fifty years
older than the Book of Leinster, but not so large;
and it contains also a great number of tales, adventures,
and histories, nearly all relating to Ireland,
and all written in the Irish language. Its name was
derived from the following circumstance:&mdash;St. Kieran
of Clonmacnoise had a favourite brown cow, whose
skin, when she died, he caused to be turned into
parchment, of which a book was made. But this old
book no longer exists: it was lost ages ago; and
the present "Book of the Dun Cow" is only a copy
of it.

Three other great Irish books kept in Dublin are
the Book of Lecan [Leckan], the Yellow Book of
Lecan, and the Book of Ballymote. These contain
[Pg 119]
much the same kind of matter as the Book of
Leinster&mdash;with pieces mostly different however&mdash;but
they are not nearly so old. The Speckled Book,
which is also in Dublin, is nearly as large as the
Book of Leinster, but not so old. It is mostly on
religious matters, and contains a great number of
Lives of Saints, Hymns, Sermons, portions of the
Scriptures, and other such pieces. All these books
are written with the greatest care, and in most
beautiful penmanship.

The six old books described above have been lately
printed, in such a way as that the print resembles
exactly the writing of the old books themselves. The
printed volumes are now to be found in libraries in
several parts of Ireland, as well as in England and
the Continent; so that those desirous of studying
them need not come to Dublin, as people had to do
formerly.

Many people are now eagerly studying these books
and men often come to Ireland from France, Germany,
Italy, Norway and Sweden, Russia, and other
countries, in order to learn the Irish language so as
to be able to read them. But this requires much
study, even from those who know the Irish of the
present day; for the language of those books is
old and difficult.

In many National and Intermediate schools the
Irish language is now taught, and no doubt some of
the pupils who attend the Irish classes will continue
[Pg 120]
their studies after they leave school, till they come
to be able to read our old books.

A great many old Irish tales and histories have
been printed and translated, and some of them are
very beautiful and instructive. Several of the stories
in this book are from the Book of the Dun Cow and
the Book of Leinster.


XXVII.

THE GILLA DACKER AND HIS HORSE.

[34]

Once upon a time, when Finn and the Fena were
hunting over Munster, Finn and some of his companions
encamped on the slope of Knockainey hill[35]
to rest for awhile. And they sent Finn Mac Bressal
to the top of the hill to keep watch and ward, while
they amused themselves, some playing chess, and
some viewing the chase all round and listening to
the sweet cry of the hounds.

Finn Mac Bressal had been watching only a little
[Pg 121]
time, when he saw on the plain to the east, a
Fomor[36]
of vast size coming towards the hill, leading a horse.
As he came nearer, Finn Mac Bressal observed that
he was the ugliest-looking giant his eyes ever lighted
on. He had a large, thick body, bloated and swollen
out to a great size; clumsy, crooked legs; and broad,
flat feet, turned inwards. His hands and arms and
shoulders were bony and thick and very strong-looking;
his neck was long and thin; and while
his head was poked forward, his face was turned
up, as he stared straight at Finn Mac Bressal. He
had thick lips, and long crooked teeth; and his face
was covered all over with bushy hair.

He was fully armed; but all his weapons were
rusty and soiled. A broad shield of a dirty, sooty
colour, rough and battered, hung over his back; he
had a long, heavy, straight sword at his left hip;
and he grasped in his left hand two thick-handled,
broad-headed spears, old and rusty, that looked as
if they had not been handled for years. In his
right hand he held an iron club, which he dragged
after him, with its end on the ground; and it was
so heavy that, as it trailed along, it tore up a track
as deep as the furrow a farmer ploughs with a pair
of oxen.

The horse he led was even larger in proportion
than the giant himself, and quite as ugly. His great
[Pg 122]
carcase was covered all over with tangled, scraggy-hair,
of a sooty black; you could count his ribs and
all the points of his big bones through his hide; his
legs were crooked and knotty; his neck was twisted;
and as for his jaws, they were so long and heavy
that they made his head look twice too big for his
body.

The giant held the horse by a thick halter, and
seemed to be dragging him forward by main force, the
animal was so lazy and so hard to move. Every now
and then when the beast tried to stand still, the giant
would give him a blow on the ribs with his big iron
club, which sounded as loud as the thundering of a
great billow against the rough-headed rocks of the
coast. When he gave him a pull forward by the
halter, the wonder was that he did not drag the
animal's head away from his body; and, on the other
hand, the horse often gave the halter such a tremendous
tug backwards that it was equally wonderful
how the arm of the giant was not torn from his
shoulder.

Now it was not an easy matter to frighten Finn
Mac Bressal; but when he saw the giant and his horse
coming straight towards him in that wise, he was
seized with such fear and horror that he sprang from
his seat, and, snatching up his arms, he ran down the
hill-slope with the utmost speed towards the king
and his companions, whom he found sitting round
the chess-board, deep in their game.
[Pg 123]

They started up when they saw him looking so
scared; and, turning their eyes towards where he
pointed, they saw the big man and his horse coming
up the hill. The Fena stood gazing at him in silent
wonder, waiting till he should arrive; but although
he was no great way off when they first caught sight
of him, it was a long time before he reached the spot
where they stood, so slow was the movement of his
horse and himself.


XXVIII.

THE FENA CARRIED OFF BY THE GILLA
DACKER'S HORSE.

Patiently and in silence the Fena stood till the
giant came up; when he bowed his head, and bended
his knee, and saluted the king with great respect.

Finn addressed him; and having given him leave
to speak, he asked who he was, and what was his
name; also what was his profession or craft, and why
he had no servant to attend to his horse&mdash;if, indeed,
such an ugly old spectre of an animal could be
called a horse at all.

The big man made answer and said, "King of the
Fena, I will answer everything you ask me, as far
as lies in my power. As to where I came from, I am
a Fomor of the north; but I have no particular
[Pg 124]
dwelling-place, for I am continually travelling about
from one country to another, serving the great lords
and nobles of the world, and receiving wages for my
service.

"In the course of my wanderings I have often
heard of you, O king, and of your greatness and
splendour and royal bounty; and I have come now to
visit you, and to ask you to take me into your service
for one year; and at the end of that time I shall fix
my own wages, according to my custom.

"You ask me also why I have no servant for this
great horse of mine. The reason of that is this: at
every meal I eat, my master must give me as much
food and drink as would be enough for a hundred men;
and whosoever the lord or chief may be that takes me
into his service, it is quite enough for him to have to
provide for me, without having also to feed my
servant.

"Moreover, I am so very heavy and lazy that I
should never be able to keep up with a company on
march if I had to walk; and this is my reason for
keeping a horse at all.

"My name is the Gilla Dacker,[37] and it is not without
good reason that I am so called. For there never
was a lazier or worse servant than I am, or one that
grumbles more at doing a day's work for his master.
And I am the hardest person in the whole world to
[Pg 125]
deal with; for, no matter how good or noble I may
think my master, or how kindly he may treat me, it
is hard words and foul reproaches I am likely to give
him for thanks in the end.

"This, O Finn, is the account I have to give of
myself, and these are my answers to your questions."

"Well," answered Finn, "according to your own
account, you are not a very pleasant fellow to have
anything to do with; and of a truth there is not
much to praise in your appearance. But things may
not be so bad as you say; and, anyhow, as I have
never yet refused any man service and wages, I will
not now refuse you."

Whereupon the Gilla Dacker was taken into
service among the warriors for a year.

Then the big man said:&mdash;"Now, as to this horse
of mine, I find I must attend to him myself, as I see
no one here worthy of putting a hand near him. So
I will lead him to the nearest stud, as I am wont to
do, and let him graze among your horses. I value
him greatly, however, and it would grieve me very
much if any harm were to befal him; so," continued
he, turning to the king, "I put him under your
protection, O king, and under the protection of all
the Fena that are here present."

At this speech the Fena all burst out laughing, to
see the Gilla Dacker showing such concern for his
miserable, worthless, old skeleton of a horse.
[Pg 126]

Howbeit, the big man, giving not the least heed to
their merriment, took the halter off the horse's head,
and turned him loose among the horses of the Fena.

But now, this same wretched-looking old animal,
instead of beginning to graze, as every one thought
he would, ran in among the horses of the Fena, and
began straightway to work all sorts of mischief. He
cocked his long, hard, switchy tail straight out like a
rod, and, throwing up his hind legs, he kicked about
on this side and on that, maiming and disabling
several of the horses. Sometimes he went tearing
through the thickest of the herd, butting at them
with his hard, bony forehead; and he opened out
his lips with a vicious grin, and tore all he could lay
hold on, with his sharp, crooked teeth, so that none
were safe that came in his way either before or
behind. And the end of it was, that not an animal
of the whole herd escaped, without having a leg
broken, or an eye knocked out, or his ribs fractured,
or his ear bitten off, or the side of his face torn open,
or without being in some other way cut or maimed
beyond cure.

At last he left them, and was making straight for
a small field where Conan Mail's horses were grazing
by themselves, intending to play the same tricks
among them. But Conan, seeing this, shouted in
great alarm to the Gilla Dacker, to bring away his
horse, and not let him work any more mischief; and
threatening, if he did not do so at once, to go himself
[Pg 127]
and knock the brains out of the vicious old brute on
the spot.

But the Gilla Dacker took the matter quite coolly;
and he told Conan that he saw no way of preventing
his horse from joining the others, except some one
put the halter on him and held him, which would, of
course, he said, prevent the poor animal from grazing,
and would leave him hungry at the end of the day.
"But," said he to Conan, "there is the halter; and if
you are in any fear for your own animals, you may
go yourself and bring him away from the field."

Conan was in a mighty rage when he heard this;
and as he saw the big horse just about to cross the
fence, he snatched up the halter, and running forward
with long strides, he threw it over the animal's head
and attempted to lead him back. But in a moment the
horse stood stock still, and his body and legs became
as stiff as if they were made of wood; and though
Conan pulled and tugged with might and main, he
was not able to stir him an inch from his place.

He gave up pulling at last, when he found it was
no use; but he still kept on holding the halter, while
the big horse never made the least stir, but stood as
if he had been turned into stone; the Gilla Dacker
all the time looking on quite unconcernedly, and the
others laughing at Conan's perplexity. But no one
offered to relieve him.

At last Conan jumped up on the horse, and tried
to urge him on, but all to no purpose: for the animal
[Pg 128]
never stirred. Another of the Fena now mounted
behind him, and another, and another, till there
were fourteen of them on the horse's back. Then
the Gilla Dacker, suddenly tucking up his skirts,
darted away from the Fena, and ran south-west with
the speed of a swallow flying across a mountain side,
or of a March wind sweeping over the plain. When
the horse saw his master running, he stirred himself
at once and followed him with equal speed, carrying
off the whole fourteen men, and plunging and tearing
along as if he had nothing at all on his back.

The men now tried to throw themselves off; but
this, indeed, they were not able to do, for the good
reason that they found themselves fastened firmly,
hands and feet and all, to the horse's back. Moreover
they found that their seat was not a comfortable
one, for the old horse's backbone was rough and
scraggy, and nearly as sharp as a saw.

And now Conan, looking round, raised his big
voice, and shouted to Finn and the Fena, asking them
were they content to let their friends be carried off
in that manner by such a horrible, foul-looking old
spectre of a horse.

Finn and the others, hearing this, instantly started
off in pursuit, and for miles on miles they kept the
Gilla Dacker and the horse in view, but were not
able to overtake them. At last the horse and his
master came to the shore of the sea in the west of
Kerry, and without stop or stay they plunged forward,
[Pg 129]
moving over the waves the same as on the dry land:
and just as the Fena arrived at the shore, they lost
sight of them in the distance.


XXIX.

DERMOT O'DYNA AT THE WELL.

Great was the astonishment of the Fena, and great
their dismay, on seeing their comrades carried off in
this manner on the back of the big horse. And now
they took counsel; and what they resolved on was, to
send Dermot O'Dyna and a party of the Fena in a
ship to search for their companions. And Dermot
and the others went on board, and sailed to the west
for many leagues, till they lost sight of the shores of
Erin. At length they came to an island with steep
cliffs all round, so high that its head seemed hidden
in the clouds: and they saw by the tracks, that up
the face of this cliff the horse had made his way.
And it was agreed that Dermot O'Dyna should climb
up and explore the island in quest of their comrades.
Then Dermot put on his armour and his helmet, and
took his shield, his two spears, and his sword: and
leaning on the handles of the spears, he leaped with a
light, airy bound on the nearest shelf of rock. Using
his spears and his hands, he climbed from ledge to
ledge, while his companions watched him anxiously
[Pg 130]
from below; till, after much toil, he measured the
soles of his two feet on the green sod at the top of the
rock. And when, recovering breath, he turned round
and looked at his companions in the ship far below,
he started back with amazement and dread at the
dizzy height.

He now looked inland, and saw a beautiful country
spread out before him:&mdash;a lovely, flowery plain straight
in front, bordered with pleasant hills, and shaded
with groves of many kinds of trees. It was enough
to banish all care and sadness from one's heart to
view this country, and to listen to the warbling of
the birds, the humming of the bees among the flowers,
the rustling of the wind through the trees, and the
pleasant voices of the streams and waterfalls.

Making no delay, Dermot set out to walk across the
plain. He had not been long walking when he saw,
right before him, a great tree laden with fruit, over-topping
all the other trees of the plain. It was
surrounded at a little distance by a circle of pillar-stones;
and one stone, taller than the others, stood in
the centre near the tree. Beside this pillar-stone
was a spring well, with a large, round pool as clear as
crystal; and the water bubbled up in the centre, and
flowed away towards the middle of the plain in a
slender stream.

Dermot was glad when he saw the well; for he
was hot and thirsty after climbing up the cliff. He
stooped down to take a drink; but before his lips
[Pg 131]
touched the water, he heard the heavy tread of a
body of warriors, and the loud clank of arms, as if a whole
host were coming straight down on him. He sprang
to his feet and looked round; but the noise ceased in
an instant, and he could see nothing.

After a little while he stooped once more to drink;
and again, before he had wet his lips, he heard the
very same sounds, nearer and louder than before.
A second time he leaped to his feet; and still he saw
no one. He knew not what to think of this; and as
he stood wondering and perplexed, he happened to
cast his eyes on the tall pillar-stone that stood
on the brink of the well; and he saw on its top a
large, beautiful drinking-horn,[38] chased with gold and
enamelled with precious stones.

"Now surely," said Dermot, "I have been doing
wrong: it is, no doubt, one of the virtues of this well
that it will not let any one drink of its waters except
from the drinking-horn."

So he took down the horn, dipped it into the well,
and drank without hindrance, till he had slaked his
thirst.


[Pg 132]
XXX.

DERMOT O'DYNA FIGHTS THE WIZARD-CHAMPION,
AND AFTER A TIME RESCUES
HIS COMRADES.

Hardly had Dermot taken the horn from his lips,
when he saw a tall wizard-champion coming towards
him from the east, clad in a complete suit of mail,
and fully armed with shield and helmet, sword and
spear. A beautiful scarlet mantle hung over his
armour, fastened at his throat by a golden brooch;
he had a gold torque round his neck; and a broad
circlet of sparkling gold was bended in front across
his forehead, to confine his yellow hair, and keep
it from being blown about by the wind.

As he came nearer, he increased his pace, moving
with great strides; and Dermot now observed that he
looked very wrathful. He offered no greeting, and
showed not the least courtesy; but addressed Dermot
in a rough, angry voice&mdash;

"Surely, Dermot O'Dyna, Erin of the green plains
should be wide enough for you; and it contains abundance
of clear, sweet water in its crystal springs
and green bordered streams, from which you might
have drunk your fill. But you have come into my
island without my leave, and you have taken my
drinking-horn, and have drunk from my well; and
[Pg 133]
this spot you shall never leave till you have given
me satisfaction for the insult."



A torque [pronounced tork]
of gold: a twisted collar for the neck.
Golden torques were much used by kings and other rich people.
Many torques are in the National Museum: but most of them are
better made and twisted more closely than the one here represented.


So spoke the wizard-champion, and instantly
advanced on Dermot with fury in his eyes. But
Dermot was not the man to be terrified by any hero
or wizard-champion alive. He met the foe half-way;
and now, foot to foot, and knee to knee, and face to
[Pg 134]
face, they began a fight, watchful and wary at first,
but soon hot and vengeful, till their shields and
helmets could scarce withstand their strong thrusts
and blows. Like two enraged lions fighting to the
death, or two strong serpents intertwined in deadly
strife, or two great opposing billows thundering
against each other on the ocean border; such was the
strength and fury and determination of the combat
of these two heroes.

And so they fought through the long day, till
evening came, and it began to be dusk; when suddenly
the wizard-champion sprang outside the range
of Dermot's sword, and leaping up with a great
bound, he alighted in the very centre of the well.
Down he went through it, and disappeared in a
moment before Dermot's eyes, as if the well had
swallowed him up. Dermot stood on the brink,
leaning on his spear, amazed and perplexed, looking
after him in the water; but whether the hero had
meant to drown himself, or that he had played some
wizard trick, Dermot knew not.

He sat down to rest, full of vexation that the
wizard-champion should have got off so easily. And
what chafed him still more was that his companions
knew nought of what had happened, and that when
he returned, he could tell them nothing of the strange
hero; neither had he the least token or trophy to
show them after his long fight.

Dermot now began to think what was best to be
[Pg 135]
done; and he made up his mind to stay near the
well all night, in the hope of finding out something
further about the wizard-champion on the morrow.

He walked towards the nearest point of a great
forest that stretched from the mountain down to the
plain on his left; and as he came near, a herd of
speckled deer ran by among the trees. poising his
spear, he threw it with an unerring cast, and
brought down the nearest of the herd.

Then, having lighted a fire under a tree, he skinned
the deer and fixed it on long hazel spits to roast,
having first, however, gone to the well, and brought
away the drinking-horn full of water. And he sat
beside the roasting deer to turn it and tend the fire,
waiting impatiently for his meal; for he was hungry
and tired after the toil of the day.

When the deer was cooked, he ate till he was
satisfied, and drank the clear water of the well from
the drinking-horn; after which he lay down under the
shade of the tree, beside the fire, and slept a sound
sleep till morning.

Night passed away and the sun rose, bringing
morning with its abundant light. Dermot started up,
refreshed after his long sleep, and, repairing to the
forest, he slew another deer, and fixed it on hazel
spits to roast at the fire as before. For Dermot had
this custom, that he would never eat of any food left
from a former meal.

And after he had eaten of the deer's flesh and
[Pg 136]
drunk from the horn, he went towards the well.
But though his visit was early, he found the wizard-champion
there before him, standing beside the pillar-stone,
fully armed as before, and looking now more
wrathful than ever. Dermot was much surprised; but
before he had time to speak, the wizard-champion
addressed him&mdash;

"Dermot O'Dyna, you have now put the cap on all
your evil deeds. It was not enough that you took my
drinking-horn and drank from my well: you have
done much worse than this, for you have hunted on
my grounds, and have killed some of my speckled
deer. Surely there are many hunting-grounds in
Erin of the green plains, with plenty of deer in them;
and you need not have come hither to commit these
robberies on me. But now for a certainty you shall
not go from this spot till I have taken satisfaction
for all these misdeeds."

And again the two champions attacked each other,
and fought during the long day, from morning till
evening. And when the dusk began to fall, the
wizard-champion leaped into the well, and disappeared
down through it, even as he had done the day before.

The selfsame thing happened on the third day.
And each day, morning and evening, Dermot killed a
deer, and ate of its flesh, and drank of the water of
the well from the drinking-horn.

On the fourth morning, Dermot found the wizard-champion
standing as usual by the pillar-stone near
[Pg 137]
the well. And as each morning he looked more
angry than on the morning before, so now he scowled
in a way that would have terrified anyone but Dermot
O'Dyna.

And they fought during the day till the dusk of
evening. But now Dermot watched his foe narrowly;
and when he saw him about to spring into the well
he closed on him and threw his arms round him. The
wizard-champion struggled to free himself, moving all
the time nearer and nearer to the brink; but Dermot
held on, till at last both fell into the well. Down they
went, clinging to each other, Dermot and the strange
champion; down, down, deeper and deeper they went;
and Dermot tried to look round, but nothing could he
see save darkness and dim shadows. At length there
was a glimmer of light; then the bright day burst
suddenly upon them; and presently they came to the
solid ground, gently and without the least shock.

At the very moment they reached the ground, the
wizard-champion, with a sudden effort, tore himself
away from Dermot's grasp, and ran forward with great
speed. Dermot leaped to his feet; and he was so
amazed at what he saw around him that he stood
stock still and let the wizard-champion escape:&mdash;a
lovely country, with many green-sided hills and fair
valleys between, woods of red yew trees, and plains
laughing all over with flowers of every hue.

Right before him, not far off, lay a city of great
tall houses with glittering roofs; and on the side
[Pg 138]
nearest to him was a royal palace, larger and grander
than the rest. On the level green in front of the
palace were a number of knights, all armed, and
amusing themselves with various warlike exercises
of sword and shield and spear.



Ancient Irish bronze shield, 28 inches in diameter, found in a bog
in the Co. Limerick. Shields were often made of yew-wood, which is
very hard: and oftener still of wickerwork, covered outside with
tough hides, generally tanned. Wickerwork shields were sometimes
large enough to cover the whole body. On the inside of every shield
was a crossbar which was held in the hand: and for additional safety
a leather strap fastened to the shield, went round the warrior&#39;s neck.


To tell all Dermot's adventures here would be
too long for this book. But he remained in that
[Pg 139]
strange country, till he met the wizard champion
and subdued him in fight. And after much
searching he found Conan and the others who had
been carried off by the Gilla Dacker's horse
after which they all returned to the ship. And
they sailed back to Erin where, when they landed,
they were welcomed with a mighty shout by the
assembled Fena.

XXXI.

SAINT COLUMKILLE: Part I.

Saint Columkille[39] was born in the year 521, in
Gartan, a wild district in the county Donegal, not far
from Letterkenny. He was a near relation of the
kings of Ireland of his time; for his father was great-grandson
of the mighty King Niall of the Nine Hostages
(see p. 5): and his mother was related to the
kings of Leinster. He spent his boyhood in a little
village near Gartan; and when he was old enough, he
was sent away from his home to a school kept by a
[Pg 140]
distinguished bishop and teacher, St. Finnen, at
Movilla, near the present Newtownards, in Down.
Though he belonged to a princely family, and might
easily have become rich and great, he gave up these
worldly advantages for religion, and resolved to
become a priest.

(Drawn in 1845.)

[Pg 141]

Having spent some time at Movilla, the youthful
Columkille went to several other Irish Colleges,
including that of St. Movi, at Glasnevin, near Dublin;
and as he was a diligent student, he made great
progress in all. The most celebrated of these was
at Clonard, in Meath, in which there were many
hundreds of students under the instruction of another
St. Finnen, a great and holy man, who is styled in
old Irish writings "a doctor of wisdom and the
tutor of the saints of Ireland in his time." Here
Columkille met many young Irishmen who afterwards
became distinguished saints and missionaries.

As soon as he was ordained priest, he set about
the work of his life&mdash;spreading the Gospel. At
that time the high ridge over the river Foyle,
where now stands the old city of Derry, was an
uninhabited spot, clothed with a splendid wood of
oaks, from which it got the name of Derry, meaning
an oak grove: this spot was presented to Columkille
by his cousin, prince Aed, afterwards king of Ireland.
Here, when he was twenty-five years of age, he built
his first church, round which grew up a monastery
that continued to flourish for many hundred years,
so that, in memory of the saint, the place was long
afterwards known by the name of Derry-Columkille.
At this period of his life he was a man of noble
presence, a worthy member of a kingly race, as one
of the old Irish writers describes him:&mdash;tall, broad-shouldered,
and powerful: with long, curling hair:
[Pg 142]
luminous grey eyes, and a countenance
bright and pleasing: and he was always lively and agreeable in
conversation.



Remains of a Round Tower at Drumcliff, 4 miles north of Sligo
town: built near the church founded by St. Columkille; but long
after his time.


For fifteen years after the establishment of Derry,
Columkille continued to found churches all over the
country, among many others those of Kells in Meath,
Tory Island, Swords near Dublin, Drumcliff in Sligo,
and Durrow in King's County, the last of which
was his chief establishment in Ireland. It is
recorded that during these fifteen years he founded
altogether three hundred churches and monasteries.
These establishments, like all the other Irish
monasteries, were the means of spreading not only
religion but general enlightenment: for in most
of them there were schools; and the priests and
monks converted, and taught, and civilised, to the
best of their power, the people in their neighbourhood.
[Pg 143]

Many years before this, St. Patrick and the
missionaries who worked under his guidance, had
converted the greatest part of the Irish people to
Christianity. But the time was too short and the
missionaries too few to instruct the newly-converted
people fully in their faith: so that although they
were Christians, many of them had only a poor
knowledge of the Christian doctrine. In those times
there were certain persons in Ireland called Druids,
who were the learned men among the pagans of the
day, and who taught the people the pagan religion
known as Druidism. They hated the Christian faith,
and gave St. Patrick and his companions great trouble
by trying to persuade the pagan Irish not to become
Christians. They continued in the country till the
time of St. Columkille, as active as ever though
much fewer; and St. Columkille and the other missionaries
of his time had often hard work to win
over the people from the false teaching of these
druids, and make good Christians of them.

A great part of the north of Scotland was then
inhabited by a people called the Picts. Those of
them who lived south of the Grampian mountains
had been converted some time before by St. Ninian
of Glastonbury:[40] but the northern Picts were still
pagans; and Columkille made up his mind to leave
[Pg 144]
Ireland and devote the rest of his life to their
conversion. In 563, in the forty-second year of his age,
he bade a sorrowful farewell to his native country,
and crossing the sea with twelve companions, he
settled in the island of Iona, in the Hebrides, which
had been presented to him by his relative, the king of that part of Scotland. Here he built his little
church and monastery, all of wood, and began to
prepare for his glorious work. This little island
afterwards became the Greatest religious centre in
Scotland: and grand churches and other buildings
were erected in and around the site of Columkille's
humble structures. For many centuries Iona was
held in such honour that most of the kings and
chiefs and other great people of Scotland were
buried in it; and to this day it is full of venerable
and beautiful ruins, which are every year visited by
people from all parts of the British Islands.

The most laborious part of St. Columkille's active
life began after his settlement in Iona. He traversed
the Highlands of Scotland and the Islands of the
Hebrides, sometimes in a rude chariot, sometimes on
foot, visiting the kings and chiefs of the Picts, and
preaching to them in their homes; and he founded
churches and monasteries all over that part of
Scotland, just as he had done in Ireland. After
many years of incessant labour he succeeded in
converting the whole of the northern Picts.

When Columkille was at home in his monastery
[Pg 145]
resting from his missionary labours, his favourite
occupation was copying the Holy Scriptures. We
are told that he wrote with his own hand, in the
course of years, three hundred copies of the sacred
books, which he presented to the various churches he
had founded; and this good work he continued to
the very last day of his life. Besides mere copying,
he composed many hymns and other poems, both
in Latin and Irish. He was always employed at
something. Adamnan says that not an hour of the
day passed by without some work for himself and
his monks&mdash;praying, reading, writing, arranging the
affairs of the monastery, or manual work: for he
took his own share in cooking, grinding corn, overseeing
the men who were working in the fields,
and so forth.

SAINT COLUMKILLE: Part II.

During St. Columkille's residence in Iona he
visited Ireland more than once, on important business:
and we may be sure that he was delighted
when the opportunity came to see again the land
he loved so well. The most important of these occasions
was when he came over to take part in a great
Meeting&mdash;a sort of Parliament for all Ireland&mdash;which
was held at a place called Drum-Ketta in
[Pg 146]
Derry. The proceedings at this meeting will
be found described in the "Child's History of Ireland."

Amidst all the earnest and laborious efforts of St.
Columkille in the cause of religion, he never forgot
his native country. He looked upon himself as
an exile, though a voluntary exile in a great and
glorious cause; and a tender regret was always
mingled with his recollections of Ireland. We have
in our old books a very ancient poem in the Irish
language, believed to have been composed by him, in
which he expresses himself in this manner:&mdash;

"How delightful to be on Ben-Edar before
embarking on the foam-white sea: how pleasant to
row one's little curragh all round it, to look upward
at its bare steep border, and to hear the waves
dashing; against its rocky cliffs.

"A grey eye looks back towards Erin: a grey eye
full of tears.

"While I traverse Alban of the ravens, I think on
my little oak grove in Derry. If the tributes and
the riches of Alban were mine, from the centre to
the utmost borders, I would prefer to them all one
little house in Derry. The reason I love Derry is for
its quietness, for its purity, for its crowds of white
angels.

"How sweet it is to think of Durrow: how
delightful would it be to hear the music of the breeze
rustling through its groves.
[Pg 147]

"Plentiful is the fruit in the Western Island&mdash;beloved
Erin of many waterfalls: plentiful her
noble proves of oak. Many are her kings and
princes; sweet-voiced her clerics; her birds warble
joyously in the woods; gentle are her youths; wise
her seniors; comely and graceful her women, of
spotless virtue; illustrious her men, of noble aspect.

"There is a grey eye that fills with tears when it
looks back towards Erin. While I stand on the
oaken deck of my bark I stretch my vision westwards
over the briny sea towards Erin."

During his whole life Columkille retained his affection
for his native land and for everything connected
with it. One breezy day, when he was now in his
old age in Iona, a crane appeared flying towards the
island: it was beaten about by the wind, and with
much difficulty it reached the beach, where it fell
down quite spent with hunger and fatigue. And the
good old man said to one of his monks:&mdash;

"That crane has come from our dear fatherland,
and I earnestly commend it to thee: nurse and
cherish it tenderly till it is strong enough to return
again to its sweet home in Scotia."

Accordingly the monk took the bird up in his
arms and brought it to the hospice, and fed and
tended it for three days till it had quite recovered.
The third day was calm, and the bird rose from
the earth till it had come to a great height, when
[Pg 148]
resting for a moment to look forward, it stretched
out its neck and directed its course towards
Ireland.



Round Tower of St. Canice, Kilkenny: 100 feet high, and perfect,
except that it wants the pointed cap. St. Canice was an intimate
friend of St. Columkille: but this tower was not erected till some
centuries after the death of the two saints.


On the day before the saint's death he went to a
little hill hard by the monastery that overlooked the
whole place; and gazing-lovingly round him for the
last time, he lifted up his hands and blessed the
monastery. And as he was returning with his
attendant, he grew tired and sat down half way to
rest; for he was now very weak. While he was
sitting here an old white horse that was employed
for many years to carry the pails between the milking
place and the monastery, first looked at him
[Pg 149]
intently, and then, coming up slowly, step by step,
he laid his head gently on the saint's bosom. And
he began to moan pitifully, and big tears rolled
from his eyes and fell into the saint's lap: which,
when the attendant saw, he came up to drive him
away. Put the old man said:&mdash;"Let him alone:
he loves me. May be God has given him some
dim knowledge that his master is going; from him
and from you all: so let him alone." At last,
standing up, he blessed the poor old animal and
returned to the monastery.

The death call came to him when he was seventy-six
years of age. Though his death was not a
sudden one, he had no sickness before it: he
simply sank, wearied out with his life-long labours.
Although he knew his end was near, he kept
writing one of the Psalms till he could write no
longer; while his companion Baithen sat beside
him. At last, laying down the pen, he said, "Let
Baithen write the rest."

On the night of that same day, at the toll of
the midnight bell for prayer, he rose, feeble as he
was, from his bed, which was nothing but a bare
flagstone, and went to the church hard by, followed
immediately after by his attendant Dermot. He
arrived there before the others had time to bring
in the lights; and Dermot, losing sight of him in
the darkness, called out several times, "Where are
you, father?" Perceiving no reply, he felt his way,
[Pg 150]
till he found his master before the altar kneeling
and leaning forward on the steps: and raising him up a
little, supported his head on his breast. The monks
now came up with the lights; and seeing their
beloved old master dying, they began to weep. He
looked at them with his face lighted up with joy, and
tried to utter a blessing; but being unable to speak,
he raised his hand a little to bless them, and in the
very act of doing so he died in Dermot's arms.[41]


XXXIII.

PRINCE ALFRED IN IRELAND.

It has been already stated (p. 47) that in early
ages great numbers of foreigners came to Ireland to
study in the colleges. Among those was Aldfrid or
Alfred,[42] Prince of Northumbria, one of the Kingdoms
[Pg 151]
of the Saxon Heptarchy. His history is interesting
to us as exhibiting an example of the class of persons
who came to Ireland for education in those days,
and as showing the close relations existing between
many of the royal families of England and Ireland.

In the year 670, on the death of his father Oswy,
who was king of Northumbria, the throne was
seized unjustly by Alfred's younger brother, Egfrid:
whereupon Alfred fled to Ireland. He was all the
more ready to choose this as his place of exile,
inasmuch as he was fond of learning, and he knew
well that there were more learned and skilful
teachers and better opportunities for study in
Ireland than elsewhere. But he had another good
reason; for his mother Fina [Feena] was an Irish
princess of the family of the kings of Meath. The
Irish knew him by the name "Flann," or more
commonly Flann Fina, from his mother. He
remained many years in Ireland, studying with great
diligence in various colleges, till he had mastered
most of the branches of learning then taught. He
became specially skilled in the Holy Scriptures, and
he also learned to speak and write the Irish language.

While he was in Ireland he was for a time
under the instruction of St. Adamnan, the writer of
the life of St. Columkille (see p. 140, note); and so
close and affectionate was the intimacy between
them, that the ancient Irish writers often call Alfred
Adamnan's foster-son.
[Pg 152]

In the year 684 a party of Saxons were sent from
Northumbria by Egfrid across the sea on a plundering
expedition to Ireland. Having ravaged the coast of
Meath,[43] between Ben-Edar and the Boyne, these
marauders carried off a number of captives, who
were held in bondage during the short remainder of
his reign. In the very next year Egfrid was killed
in battle, on which the Northumbrian nobles, who
were well aware of Alfred's virtues and great
abilities, sent to Ireland inviting him to take the
throne: and accordingly he returned to England and
became king of the Northumbrians.

This is one of the bosses at the two ends of a gorget, like that figured
at page 19. Now in the National Museum, Dublin.


The poor captives were still kept in slavery: but
Adamnan, seeing now a chance for their release,
[Pg 153]
proceeded to the Northumbrian court to plead with
his friend and former pupil for their restoration.
He was received most affectionately; and at his
intercession the king had the captives set free.
Adamnan then brought them back, to the number of
sixty, and restored them all rejoicing to their homes
and friends.

As soon as Alfred had taken possession of the
throne he took careful measures to have his people
instructed in learning, religion, and virtue, in
accordance with what he had himself seen and
learned in Ireland; and he governed his kingdom
for nineteen years in peace and prosperity.

In several ancient Irish manuscripts, including
the Book of Leinster, there is a poem in the Irish
language in praise of Ireland, said to have been
composed by Alfred Flann Fina; of which the
following are some of the verses faithfully
translated[44]:&mdash;

Prince Aldfrid's Account of Ireland.


I found in Inisfail the fair,
In Ireland, while in exile there,
Women of worth, both grave and gay men,
Many clerics and many laymen.
[Pg 154]
I travelled its fruitful provinces round,
And in every one of the five I found,
Alike in church and in palace hall,
Abundant apparel, and food for all.

Gold and silver I found, and money,
Plenty of wheat and plenty of honey;
I found God's people rich in pity,
Found many a feast and many a city.

I found in Munster, unfettered of any,
Kings, and queens, and poets a many&mdash;
Poets well skilled in music and measure,
Prosperous doings, mirth and pleasure.

I found in Connaught the just, redundance
Of riches, milk in lavish abundance;
Hospitality, vigour, fame,
In Cruachan's[45] land of heroic name.

I found in Ulster, from hill to glen,
Hardy warriors, resolute men;
Beauty that bloomed when youth was gone,
And strength transmitted from sire to son.

I found in Leinster the smooth and sleek,
From Dublin to Slewmargy's[46] peak;
Flourishing pastures, valour, health,
Long-living worthies, commerce, wealth.
[Pg 155]
I found in Meath's fair principality,
Virtue, vigour, and hospitality;
Candour, joyfulness, bravery, purity,
Ireland's bulwark and security.

I found strict morals in age and youth,
I found historians recording truth;
The things I sing of in verse unsmooth,
I found them all&mdash;I have written sooth.



XXXIV.

THE VOYAGE OF MAILDUNE.

An Account of the Adventures of Maildune[47] and
his Crew, and of the Wonderful Things they
saw during their Voyage of Three Years and
Seven Months, in their Curragh, on the
Western Sea.

In that part of Thomond[48] lying opposite the Aran
Islands there once lived a young chief named Maildune.
When he was an infant, a band of marauders
[Pg 156]
landed on the coast, and plundered the whole
district, and slew his father by burning the house over his
head. Maildune grew up knowing nothing of all this,
for his mother concealed it from him. But one day,
when he was now a young man, he was contending
in certain games of strength with a number of young
persons of his own age, and he obtained the victory
in every contest. At last it came to throwing
the handstone: and when he had thrown it farther
than all the others, an envious foul-tongued fellow
who was standing by said to him:&mdash;

"It would better become you to avenge the man
who was burned to death here, than to be amusing
yourself casting a stone over his bare, burnt bones."

"Who was he?" inquired Maildune.

"Your own father," replied the other.

"Who slew him?" asked Maildune.

"Plunderers from a fleet slew him and burned him
in this house; and the same plunderers are now
living in an island far out in the sea, and they still
have the same fleet."

Maildune was disturbed and sad after hearing this.
He dropped the stone that he held in his hand,
folded his cloak round him, buckled on his shield,
and left the company. And having made further
inquiry and found that the story was true, he resolved
that he would never rest till he had overtaken
these plunderers, and avenged on them the
death of his father.
[Pg 157]

Then he sent for a skilful workman to whom he
gave directions to make for him a triple-hide curragh[49]
large enough to hold sixty persons and all things
needed for a voyage. This was done: and Maildune
chose his companions; and having laid in a little
stock of provisions, and whatever other things were
needed, he put to sea.

The First Island.&mdash;Tidings of the Plunderers.

They sailed that day and night, as well as the whole
of the next day, till darkness came on again; and at
midnight they saw two small bare islands, with two
great houses on them near the shore. When they
drew nigh, they heard the sounds of merriment and
laughter, and the shouts of revellers intermingled
with the loud voices of warriors boasting of their
deeds. And listening to catch the conversation, they
heard one warrior say to another&mdash;

"Stand off from me, for I am a better warrior
than thou; it was I who slew Maildune's father, and
burned the house over his head; and no one has ever
dared to avenge it on me. Thou hast never done a
great deed like that!"

[Pg 158]
"Now surely," said one of Maildune's companions
to him, "Heaven has guided our ship to this place.
Here is an easy victory. Let us sack this house,
since our enemies have been revealed to us and
delivered into our hands!"

While they were yet speaking, the wind arose, and
a great tempest suddenly broke on them. And they
were driven violently before the storm, all that night
and a part of next day, into the great and boundless
ocean; so that they saw neither the islands they had
left nor any other land; and they knew not whither
they were going.

Then Maildune said, "Take down your sail and
put by your oars, and let the curragh drift before the
wind in whatsoever direction it pleases God to lead
us": which was done.


XXXV.

AN EXTRAORDINARY MONSTER.

During the next few days, the wind bore Maildune's
curragh along smoothly, so that the crew had not to
use their oars. The island they now came to had a
wall all round it. When they approached the shore,
an animal of vast size, with a thick, rough skin,
started up inside the wall, and ran round the island
with the swiftness of the wind. When he had
ended his race, he went to a high point, and standing
[Pg 159]
on a large, flat stone, began to exercise himself
according to his daily custom, in the following
manner. He kept turning himself completely round
and round in his skin, the bones and flesh moving,
while the skin remained at rest.

When he was tired of this exercise, he rested a
little; and he then set to work turning his skin continually
round his body, down at one side and up at
the other like a mill-wheel; but the bones and flesh
did not move.

After spending some time at this sort of exercise,
he started and ran round the island as at first, as if
to refresh himself. He then went back to the same
spot, and this time, while the skin that covered the
lower part of his body remained without motion, he
whirled the skin of the upper part round and round
like the movement of a flat-lying millstone. And it
was in this manner that he passed most of his time
on the island.

Maildune and his people, after they had seen these
strange doings, thought it better not to venture
nearer. So they put out to sea in great haste. The
monster, observing them about to fly, ran down to
the beach to seize the curragh; but finding that they
had got out of his reach, he began to fling round stones
at them with great force and an excellent aim. One of
them struck Maildune's shield and went quite through
it, lodging in the keel of the curragh; after which the
voyagers got beyond his range and sailed away.
[Pg 160]


In a wall-circled isle a big monster they found,
With a hide like an elephant, leathery and bare;
He threw up his heels with a wonderful bound,
And ran round the isle with the speed of a hare.

But a feat more astounding has yet to be told:
He turned round and round in his leathery skin;
His bones and his flesh and his sinews he rolled&mdash;
He was resting outside while he twisted within!

Then changing his practice with marvellous skill,
His carcase stood rigid and round went his hide;
It whirled round his bones like the wheel of a mill&mdash;
He was resting within while he twisted outside!

Next, standing quite near on a green little hill,
After galloping round in the very same track,
While the skin of his breast remained perfectly still,
Like a millstone he twisted the skin of his back!

But Maildune and his men put to sea in their boat,
For they saw his two eyes looking over the wall;
And they knew by the way that he opened his throat,
He intended to swallow them, curragh and all!


The Silver Pillar of the Sea.

The next wonderful thing the voyagers came across
was an immense silver pillar standing in the sea. It
had eight sides, each of which was the width of an
[Pg 161]
oar-stroke of the curragh, so that its whole circumference
was eight oar-strokes. It rose out of the sea
without any land or earth about it, nothing but the
boundless ocean; and they could not see its base
deep down in the water, neither were they able to
see the top on account of its vast height.

A silver net hung from the top down to the very
water, extending far out at one side of the pillar;
and the meshes were so large that the curragh in full
sail went through one of them. When they were
passing through it, Diuran, one of Maildune's companions,
struck the mesh with the edge of his spear,
and with the blow cut a large piece off it.

"Do not destroy the net," said Maildune; "for
what we see is the work of great men."

"What I have done," answered Diuran, "is for the
honour of my God, and in order that the story of our
adventures may be more readily believed; and I shall
lay this silver as an offering on the altar of Armagh,
if I ever reach Erin."

That piece of silver weighed two ounces and a half,
as it was reckoned afterwards by the people of the
church of Armagh.

After this the voyagers heard someone speaking
on the top of the pillar, in a loud, clear, glad voice;
but they knew neither what he said, nor in what
language he spoke.


[Pg 162]
XXXVI.

MAILDUNE MEETS HIS ENEMY, IS RECONCILED
TO HIM, AND ARRIVES HOME.

The next land the travellers sighted was a small
island. On a near approach they recognised it as
the very same island they had seen in the beginning
of their voyage, in which they had heard the man
in the great house boast that he had slain Maildune's
father, and from which the storm had driven them
out into the great ocean.

They turned the prow of their vessel to the shore,
landed, and went towards the house. It happened
that at this very time the people of the house were
seated at their evening meal; and Maildune and his
companions, as they stood outside, heard a part of
their conversation.

Said one to another, "It would not be well for us
if we were now to see Maildune."

"As to Maildune," answered another, "it is very
well known that he was drowned long ago in the
great ocean."

"Do not be sure," observed a third; "perchance
he is the very man that may waken you up some
morning from your sleep."

"Supposing he came now," asked another, "what
should we do?"

The head of the house now spoke in reply to the
last question; and Maildune at once knew the voice,
[Pg 163]
for it was the voice of the man who had made a
boast of slaying the young chief's father.

And what he said was:&mdash;"I can easily answer
that. Maildune has been for a long time suffering
great afflictions and hardships; and if he were to
come now, though we were enemies once, I should
certainly give him a welcome and a kind reception."

When Maildune heard this he knocked at the
door; and the door-keeper asked who was there; to
which Maildune made answer&mdash;

"It is I, Maildune, returned safely from all my
wanderings."

The chief of the house then ordered the door to be
opened; and he went to meet Maildune, and brought
him and his companions into the house. They were
joyfully welcomed by the whole household; new garments
were given to them; and they feasted and rested,
till they forgot their weariness and their hardships.

They related all the wonders God had revealed to
them in the course of their voyage, according to the
word of the sage who says, "It will be a source of
pleasure to remember these things at a future time."

After they had remained here for some days,
Maildune and his companions returned to their own
country. And Diuran took the piece of silver he had
cut down from the great net at the Silver Pillar,
and laid it, according to his promise, on the high
altar of Armagh.

TENNYSON'S "VOYAGE OF MAILDUNE."

("Founded on an Irish Legend: a.d. 700.")

Of the tale called the "Voyage of Maildune," the
oldest copy is in the Book of the Dun Cow, which
was copied from older books eight hundred years
ago: but here the story is imperfect at both the
beginning and end, portions of the book having been
torn away at some former time. There is, however,
a perfect copy in the Yellow Book of Lecan.[50] It
was translated and published for the first time in
"Old Celtic Romances" in 1879. When this book
appeared, the great English poet, Alfred Tennyson
(afterwards Lord Tennyson), read the story, and
made it the subject of a beautiful poem, also called
"The Voyage of Maildune." Portions of the beginning
and end of this poem are here given:&mdash;

I.


I was the chief of the race&mdash;he had stricken my father dead&mdash;
But I gather'd my fellows together, I swore I would strike off his head.
Each of them looked like a king, and was noble in birth as in worth,
[Pg 165]
And each of them boasted he sprang from the oldest race upon earth.
Each was as brave in the fight as the bravest hero of song,
And each of them liefer had died than have done one another a wrong.
He lived on an isle in the ocean&mdash;we sail'd on a Friday morn&mdash;
He that had slain my father the day before I was born.


II.


And we came to the isle in the ocean, and there on the shore was he.
But a sudden blast blew us out and away thro' a boundless sea.




XI.


And we came to the Isle of a saint who had sail'd with St. Brendan[51] of yore,
He had lived ever since on the Isle and his winters were fifteen score,
And his voice was low as from other worlds, and his eyes were sweet,
[Pg 166]
And his white hair sank to his heels and his white beard fell to his feet,
And he spake to me, "O Maeldune, let be this purpose of thine!
Remember the words of the Lord when he told us 'Vengeance is mine!'
His fathers have slain thy fathers in war or in single strife,
Thy fathers have slain his fathers, each taken a life for a life,
Thy father had slain his father, how long shall the murder last?
Go back to the Isle of Finn[52] and suffer the Past to be Past."


XII.


And we came to the Isle we were blown from, and there on the shore was he,
The man that had slain my father. I saw him and let him be.
O weary was I of the travel, the trouble, the strife and the sin,
When I landed again, with a tithe of my men, on the Isle of Finn.

ST. DONATUS, BISHOP OF FIESOLE.
[53]

Part I.

At page 47 of this book it has been related how
missionaries and learned men went in great numbers
from Ireland to the Continent in the early ages of
Christianity to preach the Gospel and to teach in
colleges. A full account of the lives and labours of
these earnest and holy men would fill several volumes:
but the following short sketch of one of them will
give the reader a good idea of all.

Donatus was born in Ireland of noble parents
towards the end of the eighth century. There is
good reason to believe that he was educated in the
monastic school of Inishcaltra, a little island in
Lough Derg, near the Galway shore, now better
known as Holy Island[54]: so that he was probably
a native of that part of the country. Here he studied
with great industry and success. He became a priest,
and in course of time a bishop: and he was greatly
distinguished as a professor.

[Pg 168]

Having spent a number of years teaching, he resolved
to make a pilgrimage to Rome and visit the
holy places on the way. He had a favourite pupil
named Andrew, belonging to a noble Irish family,
a handsome, high-spirited youth, but of a deeply
religious turn: and these two, master and scholar,
were much attached. And when Donatus made
known his intention to go as a pilgrim to foreign
lands, Andrew, who could not bear to be separated
from him, begged to be permitted to go with him:
to which Donatus consented. When they had made
the few simple preparations necessary, they went
down to the shore, accompanied by friends and
relatives; and bidding farewell to all&mdash;home, friends,
and country&mdash;amid tears and regrets, they set sail
and landed on the coast of France.

And now, here were these two men, with stout
hearts, determined will, and full trust in God, exhibiting
an excellent example of what numberless
Irish exiles of those days gave up, and of what trials
and dangers they exposed themselves to, for the sake of
religion. One was a successful teacher and a bishop;
the other a young chief; and both might have lived
in their own country a life of peace and plenty. But
they relinquished all that for a higher and holier
purpose; and they brought with them neither luxury
nor comfort. They had, on landing, just as much
money and food as started them on their journey;
and with a small satchel strapped on shoulder, containing
[Pg 169]
a book or two and some other necessary
articles, and with stout staff in hand, they travelled
the whole way on foot. Whenever a monastery lay
near their road, there they called, sure of a kind
reception, and rested for a day or two. When no
monastery was within reach, they simply begged
for food and night shelter as they fared along, making
themselves understood by the peasantry as
best they could, for they knew little or nothing of
their language. Much hardship they endured from
hunger and thirst, bad weather, rough paths that
often led them astray, and constant fatigue. They
were sometimes in danger too from rude and wicked
peasants, some of whom thought no more of killing
a stranger than of killing a sparrow. But before
setting out, the two pilgrims knew well the hardships
and dangers in store for them on the way: so that
they were quite prepared for all this: and on they
trudged, contented and cheerful, never swerving an
instant from their purpose. They travelled in a
sort of zigzag way, continually turning aside to visit
churches, shrines, hermitages, and all places consecrated
by memory of old-time saints, or of past
events of importance in the history of Christianity.
And whenever they heard, as they went slowly along,
of a man eminent for holiness and learning, they
made it a point to visit him, so as to have the benefit
of his conversation and advice; using the Latin language,
which all learned men spoke in those times.

In this manner the pilgrims made their way right
through France, and on through north Italy, till
they arrived at Rome. This was the main object of
their pilgrimage, and here they sojourned for a considerable
time. Having obtained the Pope's blessing,
they set out once more, directing their steps now
towards Tuscany, till at length they reached the
beautiful mountain of Fiesole, near Florence, where
stood many churches and other memorials of Christian
saints and martyrs. They entered the hospice of the
monastery, intending to rest there for a week or two,
and then to resume their journey. At this time
Irish pilgrims and missionaries were respected
everywhere on the Continent; and as soon as the
arrival of those two became known, they were
received with honour by both clergy and people, who
became greatly attached to them for their gentle
quiet ways, and their holiness of life.

It happened about the time of their arrival
here, that the pastor of Fiesole, who was a bishop,
died; and the clergy and people resolved to have
Donatus for their pastor. But when they went to
[Pg 171]
him and told him what they wanted, he became
frightened; and trembling greatly, he said to them
in his gentle humble way:&mdash;

"We are only poor pilgrims from Scotia, and I do
not wish to be your bishop; for I am not at all
fit for it, hardly even knowing your language or
your customs."

But the more he entreated the more vehemently
did they insist: so that at last he consented to
take the bishop's chair. This was in or about the
year 824.

We need not follow the life of St. Donatus further
here. It is enough to say that, notwithstanding all
his fears and his deep humility, he became a great
and successful pastor and missionary. For about
thirty-seven years he laboured among the people of
Fiesole, by whom he was greatly loved and revered.
Down to the day of his death, which happened
about 861, when he was a very old man, he was
attended by his affectionate friend Andrew. He
is to this day honoured in and around Fiesole, as
an illustrious saint of those times. His tomb is
still shown and regarded with much veneration:
and in the old town there are several other memorials
of him.

Like St. Columkille, Donatus always cherished a
tender regretful love for Ireland; and like him also
he wrote a short poem in praise of it which is still
preserved. It is in Latin, and the following is a
[Pg 172]
translation, made by a Dublin poet many years
ago:&mdash;


Far westward lies an isle of ancient fame,
By nature bless'd; and Scotia is her name,
Enroll'd in books[55]: exhaustless is her store,
Of veiny silver, and of golden ore.[56]
Her fruitful soil, for ever teems with wealth,
With gems[57] her waters, and her air with health;
Her verdant fields with milk and honey flow;[58]
Her woolly fleeces[59] vie with virgin snow;
Her waving furrows float with bearded corn;
And arms and arts her envied sons adorn![60]
No savage bear, with lawless fury roves,
Nor fiercer lion, through her peaceful groves;
No poison there infects, no scaly snake
Creeps through the grass, nor frog annoys the lake;[61]
An island worthy of its pious race,
In war triumphant, and unmatch'd in peace!

HOW IRELAND WAS INVADED BY DANES
AND ANGLO-NORMANS.

From the time of the settlement of the Milesians, as
described at page 3, Ireland was ruled by native
kings, without any disturbance from outside, till the
arrival of the invaders we are now about to speak of.

During all these centuries, though there were
troubles enough from the quarrels of the kings
and chiefs, learning and art, as we have seen, were
successfully cultivated. But a change came&mdash;a woful
change&mdash;once the Danes began to arrive. These
were pirates, all pagans, from Denmark and other
countries round the Baltic Sea, brave and daring,
but very wicked and cruel, who for a long period
kept, not only Ireland, but the whole of western
Europe in terror. They appeared for the first time
on the coast of Ireland in the year 795, when they
plundered St. Columkille's monastery on Lambay
Island near Dublin. After this, for more than
two hundred years, the country was never free from
them, and they plundered and burned and destroyed
churches, monasteries, libraries, and homesteads, and
killed all that fell in their way, men, women, and
children. They were often attacked and routed by the
native chiefs; but this did not much discourage them
and they generally landed so suddenly, and marched
[Pg 174]
through the country so swiftly, that in most cases
they got clear off to their ships, with all their plunder,
before the people could overtake them. They settled
permanently in various towns on the coast, especially
Dublin, Waterford, and Limerick, which they held
for a long time.

At last they were overthrown by Brian Boru king
of Ireland, in a great battle fought at Clontarf near
Dublin, on Good Friday, the 23rd April, 1014, of
which a full account may be read in the "Child's
History of Ireland." After this, though no attempt
was made to expel them from the country, they gave
little trouble. They became Christians, intermarried
with the natives, and settled down to industry and
commerce like the rest of the people; and there are
many of their descendants to this day in various
parts of Ireland.

For about a century and a half after the battle of
Clontarf, eight Irish kings reigned: but none of
them succeeded in mastering the whole country.
Some of these were O'Briens of Munster, the descendants
of Brian Boru; some O'Loghlins of Ulster, a
branch of the O'Neill family, descendants of Niall of
the Nine Hostages (see p. 5); and some O'Conors of
Connaught. During this period Ireland was greatly
disturbed; for the several kings were continually
fighting with each other, striving who should be
head king: so that the next invaders, when they
came, found the country ill prepared to resist them.
[Pg 175]

Those who have read the History of England will
remember that the Normans, coming from France
under William the Conqueror, took the sovereignty
of England after the battle of Hastings in 1066.
About a century later, their descendants, who
were now called Anglo-Normans, i.e. English Normans,
made settlements in Ireland. Their leader
when they first arrived was Earl Strongbow; but in
1171 Henry II., king of England, came over with an
army and took command. In 1172 he annexed
Ireland to the crown of England, that is, he claimed
it as a part of his dominions. The Over-king of
Ireland at this time was Roderick O'Conor. He
was unable to repel the new invaders: and after his
death there was no longer a native king over all
Ireland.

King Henry divided nearly the whole island
among his lords, who all went, after some time, to
reside in their own territories: but they were to
remain under the authority of the king. These lords
soon became great and powerful, and ruled like
princes; and from them descend the chief Anglo-Irish
families, of whom the most distinguished were the
Geraldines or Fitzgeralds, the Butlers, and the De
Burgos or Burkes.

But it must not be supposed that all this was
done quietly: for the native Irish chiefs everywhere
resisted these new lords. Although king Henry
went through the form of "annexing" Ireland, it
[Pg 176]
was annexed only in name. In reality his authority
extended over only a small portion. It took more
than four hundred years to annex the whole country:
and during all this time there were constant wars,
the Anglo-Normans encroaching, and the Irish
chiefs resisting as best they could. It was only in
the reign of James I., that is, about three hundred
years ago, that the whole of Ireland was brought
under English law.

an Anglo-Norman lord.


These Anglo-Normans were a great and famous
people, skilful and mighty in war; and they built
splendid abbeys, churches, and castles, all over Ireland
the ruins of which remain to this day. As an
example of what manner of men they were, a sketch
[Pg 178]
of the career of one of them&mdash;Sir John de Courcy&mdash;is
given in this book (page 190).



Kilclief Castle, Co. Down. Built by one of the Anglo-Normans

For hundreds of years after the Invasion, people
continued to come from England to live in Ireland
both Anglo-Norman and Anglo-Saxon. After settling
down they became good friends with the native Irish,
intermarried with them, learned to speak and read
the Irish language, and quite fell in with the customs
and modes of the country, so that it was said of them
that they became "more Irish than the Irish themselves."
A large proportion of the present inhabitants
of Ireland are of this race, mixed up however
by intermarriage, with the older Milesian stock.

THE WATCH-FIRE OF BARNALEE.

During the many wars in Ireland, small parties of
men had often to traverse the country for long
distances to bring messages from one general to
another, and for other purposes. They marched by
day and put up at night in the woods, choosing some
sheltered corner and making a big fire of brambles
to keep them warm and to cook their food. After
supper they usually sat by the fire, amusing themselves
with pleasant conversation or by telling stories:
and when at last it was time to go to sleep, they
wrapped themselves up in their great coats and lay
down round the fire, leaving one of their number to
stand guard.

The following short poem&mdash;part of a much longer
one&mdash;describes how a small party of four men passed
the early part of the night during a march across
country. There was to be a battle in a day or
two, and these four friends met, and each told a
story by the Watch-fire of Barnalee. And they
arranged to meet again after the battle, if any
survived. But this turned out to be a sad meeting:
there were only two: the other two lay dead
on the battlefield.

There were four comrades stout and free,
Within the Wood of Barnalee,
Under the spreading oaken tree.

The ragged clouds sailed past the moon;
Loud rose the brawling torrent's croon;
The rising winds howled in the wood,
Like hungry wolves at scent of blood.
Yet there they sat, in converse free,
Under the spreading oaken tree,&mdash;
Garrod the Minstrel, with his lyre,
Sir Hugh le Poer, that heart of fire,
Dark Gilliemore, the mournful squire,
And Donal, from the banks of nier.

spectrally shone the watch-fire light
On their sun-browned faces and helmets bright
Showing beneath the woodland glooms
Their swords, and jacks, and waving plumes;
As there they sat, those comrades free,
Within the Wood of Barnalee,
Under the spreading oaken tree,
And told their tales to you and me.

CAHAL O'CONOR OF THE RED HAND:
KING OF CONNAUGHT.

Roderick O'Connor, the last native king of Ireland
retired from the throne towards the end of the
twelfth century, to end his days in the monastery
of Cong.[62] After his time, as we have said, there
was no longer a king over the whole country. But
for hundreds of years afterwards, kings continued to
reign over the five provinces. Roderick had been
king of Connaught before he became king of all
Ireland; and after his retirement there were several
claimants for the Connaught throne, who contended
with one another, so that the province was for a
long time disturbed with wars and battles.

Roderick had a young brother named Cahal, who
was called Cahal of the Red Hand, from a great
blood-red mark on his right hand. He would
naturally have a claim to the Connaught throne
when old enough; and as he was, even when a boy,
a noble young fellow, and showed great ability, the
queen of Connaught, jealous of him, feared that when
he grew up he would give trouble, and she sought him
[Pg 182]
out, determined to kill him: so that Cahal and his
mother had to flee from one hiding place to another.

Finding at last that he could no longer remain
in the province with safety, he and his mother
crossed the Shannon into Leinster, where no one
knew him, and there for several years they remained,
while he made a poor living for both, by working in
the fields as a common labourer. And as the fame
of the brave young Cahal with the red mark on his
hand, had gone abroad, he always wore a loose
mitten on his right hand for fear of discovery; for
he knew well that the queen had spies everywhere
searching for him.

At this time the people had no newspapers: but
there were news-carriers who made it their business
to travel continually about the country, picking up
information wherever they could, and relating all
that occurred whenever they came to a village, or to
any group of people who desired to hear the news.
They generally received some small payment; and
in this manner they made their living.

One day while Cahal was employed with several
others, reaping in a field of rye, they saw one of
these men approaching; and they stopped their
work for a few moments to hear what he had to say.
After relating several unimportant matters, he came
at last to the principal news:&mdash;that the king of
Connaught was dead, and that the leading people of
the province, having met in counsel to choose a king
[Pg 183]
declared that they would have no one but young
Cahal of the Red Hand. "And now," continued the
newsman, "I and many others have been searching
for him for several weeks. He is easily known, for
his right hand is blood-red from the wrist out: but
up to this we have been unsuccessful. We fear
indeed that he is living in poverty in some remote
place where he will never be found: or it may be
that he is dead."

When Cahal heard this, his heart gave a great
bound, and he stood musing for a few moments.
Then flinging his sickle on the ridge, he exclaimed:&mdash;"Farewell
reaping-hook: now for the sword!"
And pulling off the mitten, he showed his red hand,
and made himself known. The newsman, instantly
recognising him, threw himself prostrate before him
to acknowledge him as his king. And ever since
that time, "Cahal's farewell to the rye," has been
a proverb in Connaught, to denote a farewell for
ever. He returned immediately with his mother to
Connaught, where he was joyfully received, and was
proclaimed king in 1190.

At this time the Anglo-Norman barons who had
come over at the time of Henry II.'s Invasion, nearly
twenty years before, had settled down in various
parts of Ireland: and they were constantly encroaching
on the lands of the Irish and erecting
strong castles everywhere; while the Irish chiefs as
we have already said, resisted as far as they were
[Pg 184]
able, so that there was much disturbance all over
the country. Cahal was a brave and active king, and
took a leading part in fighting against the barons.

After he had reigned over Connaught in peace for
eight or nine years, trouble came again. There was
at this time, settled in Limerick, a powerful Anglo-Norman
baron, William de Burgo, to whom a large
part of Connaught had been granted by King
Henry II. This man stirred up another of the
O'Conors to lay claim to the throne in opposition to
Cahal, promising to help him: and now Connaught
was again all ablaze with civil war. Cahal was
defeated in battle, and fled to Ulster to Hugh
O'Neill, prince of Tyrone, who took up his cause.
Marching south with his own and O'Neill's men,
he attacked his rival, but was defeated, and again
fled north. He soon made a second attempt, aided
this time by Sir John de Courcy (for whom see
page 190): but he and De Courcy were caught in an
ambush in Galway by the rival king, who routed their
army. In this fight De Courcy very nearly lost his
life, being felled senseless from his horse by a stone.
Recovering in good time however, he and Cahal
escaped from the battlefield, and fled northwards.

Cahal of the Red Hand, in no way cowed by these
terrible reverses, again took the field, after some
time, aided now by De Burgo, who had changed
sides. A battle was fought near Roscommon, in
which the rival king was slain; and Cahal once
[Pg 185]
more took possession of the throne. From this
period forward he ruled without a native rival;
though a few years later, he was forced to surrender
a large part of his kingdom to King John, in order
that he might secure possession of the remainder.

But he was as vigilant as ever in repelling all
attempts of the barons to encroach on his diminished
territory. Thus when in 1220 the De Lacys of
Meath, a most powerful Anglo-Norman family, went
to Athleague on the Shannon at the head of Lough
Ree, where there was a ford, and began to build a
castle at the eastern or Leinster side, in order that
they might have a garrison in it always ready to
attack Connaught, Cahal promptly crossed the river
into Longford, and so frightened them that they were
glad to conclude a truce with him. And he broke
down the castle, which they had almost finished.

Cahal of the Red Hand was an upright and
powerful king, and governed with firmness and
justice. The Irish Annals tell us that he relieved
the poor as long as he lived, and that he destroyed
more robbers and rebels and evil-doers of every kind
than any other king of his time. In early life he
had founded the abbey of Knockmoy,[63] into which he
retired in the last year of his life: and in this retreat
he died in 1224.


[Pg 186]
XLIII.

"CAHAL-MORE OF THE WINE-RED HAND."

The ancient Irish people&mdash;like those of several other
countries&mdash;believed that when a just and good king
reigned, the country was blessed with fine weather and
abundant crops, the trees bended with fruit, the rivers
teemed with fish, and the whole kingdom prospered.
This was the state of Connaught while Cahal of the
Red Hand reigned in peace. And it is recorded that
when he died, fearful portents appeared, and there
was gloom and terror everywhere. James Clarence
Mangan, a Dublin poet, who died in 1849, pictures
all this in the following fine poem. He supposes
himself to be living on the river Maine, in Germany,
and he is brought to Connaught in a vision, where he
witnesses the prosperity that attended Cahal's reign.
This he sets forth in the first part of the poem: but
a sudden mysterious change for the worse comes,
which he describes in the last two verses. The
whole poem forms a wild, misty sort of picture,
such as one might see in a dream.[64]

A Vision of Connaught in the Thirteenth
Century.


I walked entranced
Through a land of Morn;
The sun, with wondrous excess of light,
Shone down and glanced
Over seas of corn
And lustrous gardens aleft and right.
Even in the clime
Of resplendent Spain,
Beams no such sun upon such a land;
But it was the time,
'Twas in the reign,
Of Cahal More of the Wine-red Hand.

Anon stood nigh
By my side a man
Of princely aspect and port sublime.
Him queried I,
"O, my Lord and Khan,[65]
What clime is this, and what golden time?"
When he&mdash;"The clime
Is a clime to praise,
The clime is Erin's, the green and bland;
And it is the time,
These be the days,
Of Cahal More of the Wine-red Hand!"
[Pg 188]
Then saw I thrones,
And circling fires,
And a dome rose near me, as by a spell,
Whence flowed the tones
Of silver lyres,
And many voices in wreath√®d swell;
And their thrilling chime
Fell on mine ears
As the heavenly hymn of an angel-band&mdash;
"It is now the time,
These be the years,
Of Cahal More of the Wine-red Hand!"

I sought the hall,
And, behold!... a change
From light to darkness, from joy to woe!
King, nobles, all,
Looked aghast and strange;
The minstrel-group sate in dumbest show!
Had some great crime
Wrought this dread amaze,
This terror? None seemed to understand!
'Twas then the time,
We were in the days,
Of Cahal More of the Wine-red Hand.

I again walked forth;
But lo! the sky
Showed fleckt with blood, and an alien sun
Glared from the north,
And there stood on high,
Amid his shorn beams, a skeleton
[Pg 189]
It was by the stream
Of the castled Maine,
One Autumn eve, in the teuton's land,
That I dreamed this dream
Of the time and reign
Of Cahal More of the Wine-red Hand!

The Irish began to build large churches and castles a little before
the arrival of the Anglo-Normans. The Irish churches of a previous
time were generally small. After the Invasion, the Anglo-Norman
barons and the Irish kings and chiefs vied with each other in erecting
churches, abbeys, and castles.



[Pg 190]

SIR JOHN DE COURCY.

Among the many Anglo-Norman lords and knights
who came to settle in Ireland in the time of Henry II.,
one of the most renowned was John de Courcy. The
Welsh writer, Gerald Barry, already mentioned
(p. 113), who lived at that time and knew him personally,
thus describes him:&mdash;

"He was of huge size, tall and powerfully built,
with bony and muscular limbs, wonderfully active
and daring, full of courage, and a bold and venturous
soldier from his youth. He was so eager for fighting
that, though commanding as general, he always
mingled with the foremost ranks in charging the
enemy, which might have lost the battle; for if he
chanced to be killed or badly wounded, there was no
general able to take his place. But though so fierce
in war, he was gentle and modest in time of peace
and very exact in attending to his religious devotions;
and when he had gained a victory he gave all the
glory to God, and took none to himself."

When King Henry II. divided the country among
his lords in 1172, he gave Ulster to De Courcy. But
it was one thing to be granted the province, and
another thing to take possession of it; for the Ulster
chiefs and people were warlike and strong; and for
[Pg 191]
five years De Courcy remained in Dublin without
making any attempt to conquer it.

At length he made up his mind to try his fortune;
and gathering his followers to the number
of about a thousand, every man well armed and
trained to battle, he set out for the north. Through
rugged and difficult ways the party rode on, and
early in the morning of the fourth day&mdash;the
2nd February, 1177&mdash;they arrived at Downpatrick,
then the capital of that part of the country. The
Irish of those times never surrounded their towns
with walls; and the astonished Downpatrick people,
who knew nothing of the expedition, were startled
from their beds at daybreak by a mighty uproar
in the streets&mdash;shouts, and the clatter of horses'
hoofs, and the martial notes of bugles. Whatever
little stock of provisions the party had brought
with them was gone soon after they left Dublin; and
by the time they arrived at Downpatrick they were
half-starved. They scattered themselves everywhere,
and, breaking away for the time from the control
of their leader, they fell ravenously on all the
food they could lay their hands on: they smashed
in doors and set fire to houses, and ate and drank
and slew as if they were mad, till the town was half
destroyed. And the people were taken so completely
by surprise that there was hardly any resistance.

When this terrible onslaught at last came to an
end, De Courcy, having succeeded in bringing his
[Pg 192]
men together, made an encampment, which he carefully
fortified; and there the little army rested from
their toils. At the end of a week the chief of the
district came with a great army to expel the invaders;
while De Courcy arranged his men in ranks with
great skill, to withstand the attack. The Ulstermen
who were without armour, wearing a loose saffron-coloured
tunic over the ordinary dress, according to
the Irish fashion, rushed on with fearless bravery;
but by no effort could they break the solid ranks of
the armour-clad Anglo-Normans, who, after a long
struggle put them to flight, and pursued them for
miles along the seashore.

After this victory De Courcy settled in Downpatrick
with his followers, and built a strong castle
there for his better security. Nevertheless the Ulstermen,
in no way discouraged, continued their fierce
attacks: and though he was victorious in several
battles, he was defeated in others, so that for a
long time he had quite enough to do to hold his
ground.

But through all his difficulties the valiant De Courcy
kept up his heart and battled bravely on, continually
enlarging his territory, founding churches and building
strong castles all over the province. King Henry
was so pleased with his bravery, and with his success
in extending the English dominions, that he made
him earl of Ulster and lord of Connaught; and in
1185 he appointed him Lord Lieutenant of Ireland.
[Pg 193]
This obliged him to live in Dublin; but he left
captains and governors in Ulster to hold his castles
and protect his territory, till he should return, which
he did in 1189.


XLV.

HOW SIR JOHN DE COURCY WAS CAPTURED
AND THROWN INTO PRISON.

By the death of Henry II. in 1189, Sir John de
Courcy lost his best friend: and things began to go
ill with him when King John came to the throne in
1199. For another Anglo-Norman lord, Hugh de Lacy,
grew jealous of his great deeds, and hated him with
his whole heart, so that he took every means to
poison the king's mind against him. In a very
old volume, written by some Anglo-Irish writer,
there are several entertaining stories of all that
befel De Courcy after his return to Ulster from
Dublin in 1189. Two of these, somewhat shortened
and re-arranged, are given here, and much of the
fine old language in which they are told is retained,
as it is easily understood.

The first story relates that whereas Sir Hugh de
Lacy, who was now appointed general ruler of
Ireland by the king, did much disdain and envy
Sir John de Courcy, and being marvellous grieved
[Pg 194]
at the worthy service he did, he sought all means
that he could possible to damage and hinder him
and to bring him to confusion, and promised much
rewards in secret to those who would invent any
matter against him; for which De Lacy had no cause
but that Sir John's actions and commendations were
held in greater account than his own. He feigned
also false charges against him, and wrote them over
to the king, and sore complained of him.

Amongst other his grievous complaints, he said
De Courcy refused to do homage to King John, and
he charged him also with saying to many that the
king had somewhat to do with the death of Prince
Arthur, lawful heir to the crown of England[66]; and
many other such like things. All these were nothing
but matters feigned by De Lacy, to bring to a better
end his purpose of utterly ruining De Courcy. On
this De Courcy challenged him, after the custom of
those times, to try the matter by single combat: but
De Lacy, fearing to meet him, made excuses and
refused.

By reason of such evil and envious tales, though
untrue they were, Sir Hugh de Lacy was at last
commanded by King John to do what he might to
apprehend and take Sir John de Courcy. Whereupon
he devised and conferred with certain of Sir John's
[Pg 195]
own men how this might be done; and they said
it was not possible to do so the while he was in his
battle-harness. But they told him that it might be
done on Good Friday; for on that day it was his
accustomed usage to wear no shield, harness, or
weapon, but that he would be found kneeling at his
prayers, after he had gone about the church five
times barefooted. And having so devised, they lay
in wait for him in his church at Downpatrick; and
when they saw him barefooted and unarmed they
rushed on him suddenly. But he, snatching up a
heavy wooden cross that stood nigh the church,
defended him till it was broken, and slew thirteen of
them before he was taken. And so he was sent to
England, and was put into the Tower of London, to
remain there in perpetual, and there miserably was
kept a long time, without as much meat or apparel
as any account could be made of.

Now these men had agreed to betray their master
to Sir Hugh de Lacy for a certain reward of gold and
silver: and when they came to Sir Hugh for their
reward, he gave them the gold and silver as he had
promised. They then craved of him a passport into
England to tell all about the good service they had
done; which he gave them, with the following words
written in it:&mdash;

"This writing witnesseth that those whose names
are herein subscribed, that did betray so good a
master for reward, will be false to me and to all
[Pg 196]
the earth besides. And inasmuch as I put no trust
in them, I do banish them out of this land of Ireland
for ever; and I do let Englishmen know that none
of them may enjoy any part of this our king's land,
or be employed as servitors from this forward for
ever."



Ennis Abbey as it appeared in 1780: now carefully preserved by
the Board of Works. Built by Donogh O&#39;Brien, king of Thomond,
in 1242. See the note under Illustration, p. 189.


And so he wrote all their names, and put them
in a ship with victuals and furniture, but without
mariners or seamen, and put them to sea, and gave
them strict charge never to return to Ireland on
pain of death. And after this they were not heard
of for a long time; but by chance of weather and
lack of skilful men, they arrived at Cork, and being
taken, were brought to Sir Hugh de Lacy; and first
[Pg 197]
taking all their treasure from them, he hung them
in chains, and so left them till their bodies wasted
away.

This deed, that Sir Hugh de Lacy did, was for an
ensample that none should use himself the like, and
not for love of Sir John de Courcy: since it appeareth
from certain ancient authors that he would have it
so as that De Courcy's name should not be so much
as mentioned, and that no report or commendation
of him should ever be made.


XLVI.

SIR JOHN DE COURCY ACCEPTS A
CHALLENGE.

And now Sir John de Courcy, being in the Tower
in evil plight, cried often to God why He suffered
him to be thus so miserably used, who did build so
many good abbeys, and did so many good deeds to
God: and thus often lamenting with himself, he
asked God his latter end to finish.

It fortuned after this that much variance and
debate did grow between King John of England and
King Philip of France,[67] about a certain castle which
the king of France won from King John. And
when King Philip had often been asked to restore it
[Pg 198]
he refused, saying it was his by right. But at last
he offered to try the matter by battle. For he had a
champion, a mighty man, who had never been beaten;
and he challenged the king of England to find, on his
side, a champion to fight him, and let the title to the
castle depend on the issue thereof; to which King
John, more hasty than well advised, did agree.

And when the day of battle was appointed, the
king of England called together his Council to find
out where a champion might be found that would
take upon him this honour and weighty enterprise.
Many places they sought and inquired of, but no one
was found that was willing to engage in so perilous
a matter. And the king was in a great agony,
fearing more the dishonour of the thing than the
loss of the castle.

At length a member of the Council came to the
king and told him that there was a man in the
Tower of London, one De Courcy, that in all the
earth was not his peer, if he would only fight. The
king was much rejoiced thereat, and sent unto
him to require and command him to take the
matter in hand: but Sir John refused. The king
sent again and offered him great gifts; but
again he refused, saying he would never serve the
king in field any more; for he thought himself evil
rewarded for such service as he did him before. The
king sent to him a third time, and bade him ask
whatever he would, for himself and for his friends,
[Pg 199]
and all should be granted to him: and he said
furthermore that upon his stalworth and knightly
doings the honour of the realm of England did rest
and depend.

He answered that for himself, the thing he would
wish to ask for, King John was not able to give,
namely, the lightness and freedom of heart that he
once had, but which the king's unkind dealing had
taken from him. As for his friends, he said that,
saving a few, they were all slain in the king's
service; "and for these reasons," said he, "I mean
never to serve the king more. But"&mdash;he went on to
say&mdash;"the honour of the realm of England, that is
another matter: and I would defend it so far as lies
in my power, provided I might have such things as I
shall ask for."

This was promised to him, and the king sent
messengers to set him at liberty; who, when they
had entered into his prison, found him in great
misery. His hair was all matted, and overgrew his
shoulders to his waist; he had scarce any apparel,
and the little he had fell in rags over his great body;
and his face was hollow from close confinement and
for lack of food.

After all things that he required had been granted
to him, he asked for one thing more, namely, that
his sword should be sent for all the way to
Downpatrick in Ireland, where it would be found
within the altar of the church; for with that weapon
[Pg 200]
he said he would fight and with no other. After
much delay it was brought to him; and when they
saw it and felt its weight, they marvelled that any
man could wield it. And good food was given to
him, and seemly raiment, and he had due exercise,
and in all things he was cherished and made much
of; so that his strength of body and stoutness of
heart returned to him.


XLVII.

SIR JOHN DE COURCY AND THE FRENCH
CHAMPION.

The lists were enclosed and all things were prepared
against the day of battle. The two kings were there,
outside the lists, with most of their nobility, and
thousands of great people to look on, all sitting
on seats placed high up for good view. Within the
lists were two tents for the champions, where they
might rest till the time appointed. And men were
chosen to see that all things were carried on fairly
and in good order.

When the time drew nigh, the French champion
came forth on the field, and did his duty of obeisance,
and bowed with reverence and courtesy to all around,
and went back to his tent, where he waited for half
an hour. The king of England sent for Sir John to
come forth, for that the French champion rested a
[Pg 201]
long time awaiting his coming; to which he answered
roughly that he would come forth when he thought it
was time. And when he still delayed, the king sent
one of his Council to desire him to make haste, to
which he made answer:&mdash;"If thou or those kings
were invited to such a banquet, you would make no
great haste coming forth to partake of it."

On this the king, deeming that he was not going
to fight at all, was about to depart in a great rage,
thinking much evil of Sir John de Courcy. While
he was thus musing, Sir John came forth in surly
mood, for memory of all the ill usage that had been
wrought on him; and he stalked straight on, looking
neither to the right nor to the left, and doing no
reverence to anyone: and so back to his tent.

Then the trumpets sounded the first charge, for
the champions to approach. Forth they came, and
passing by slowly, viewed each other intently without
a word. And when the foreign champion noted
De Courcy's fierce look, and measured with his eyes
his great stature and mighty limbs, he was filled
with dread and fell all a-trembling. At length the
trumpets sounded the last charge for the fight to
begin; on which De Courcy quickly drew his sword
and advanced; but the Frenchman, turning right
round, "ranne awaie off the fielde and betooke him
to Spaine."

Whereupon the English trumpets sounded victory;
and there was such shouting and cheering, such
[Pg 202]
a-clapping of hands and such a-throwing of caps in
the air as the like was never seen before.

When the multitude became quiet, King Philip
desired of King John that De Courcy might be called
before them to give a trial of his strength by a blow
upon a helmet: to which De Courcy agreed. They
fixed a great stake of timber in the ground, standing
up the height of a man, over which they put a shirt
of mail, with a helmet on top. And when all was
ready, De Courcy, drawing his sword, looked at the
kings with a grim and terrible look that fearful it was
to behold; after which he struck such a blow as cut
clean through the helmet and through the shirt of
mail, and down deep in the piece of timber. And so
fast was the sword fixed that no man in the assembly,
using his two hands with the utmost effort, could
pluck it out; but Sir John, taking it in one hand,
drew it forth easily.

The princes, marvelling at so huge a stroke,
desired to understand why he looked so terrible at
them before he struck the blow: on which he
answered:&mdash;

"I call St. Patrick of Down to witness, that if I
had missed the mark I would have cut the heads off
both of you kings on the score of all the ill usage I
received aforetime at your hands."

King John, being satisfied with all matters as they
turned out, took his answer in good part: and he
gave him back all the dominions that before he had
[Pg 203]
in Ireland, as Earl of Ulster and lord of Connaught;
and licensed him to return, with many great gifts
besides. And to this day the people of Ireland hold
in memory Sir John de Courcy and his mighty deeds;
and the ruins of many great castles builded by him
are to be seen all over Ulster.


XLVIII.

THE GREAT EARL OF KILDARE AND THE
EARL OF ORMOND.

The great lords who settled in Ireland in the time
of Henry II. became so powerful that they ruled in
the land like so many kings. It was so hard to
reach Ireland in those times, or even to get from one
part of Ireland to another, that their master, the
king of England, had generally very little control
over them: and he often found it hard enough even
to find out what was going on among them. So those
mighty barons did very much as they liked. They
imposed taxes, raised armies, and made war on each
other, just as if they were independent sovereigns.

The Fitzgeralds, or Geraldines, were among the
most illustrious of those families. They intermarried
with the families of the native Irish kings
and princes, such as the O'Neills and O'Conors; and
altogether they fell in so well with the ways of the
[Pg 204]
country, that the Irish people came to love them
almost better than they loved their own old native
kings and chiefs. And for hundreds of years those
Geraldines took a leading part in the government of
Ireland for the kings of England.

In the time of Henry VII., who became king in
the year 1485, Garrett Fitzgerald, earl of Kildare&mdash;the
"Great Earl" as he was called&mdash;was Lord
Deputy, or chief ruler of Ireland, for the king: and
he was the leading man of his day in Ireland.[68] We
are told in the old accounts of him that he was
tall of stature, of goodly presence, very liberal and
merciful; of strict piety; mild in his government;
very easily put into a passion, but just as easily
appeased; a knight in valour, and princely in his
words and judgments.

Once he got into a great rage with one of his
servants for some blunder. It happened that two
of the gentlemen of his household were looking on:
and one of them whispered to the other, whose name
was Boice, that he would give him a good Irish
hobby if he went and plucked a hair out of the
earl's beard. Boice took him at his offer, and knowing
well the earl's good nature, he went up to him,
while he still fumed with anger, and said:&mdash;

"If so it please your good lordship, one of your
horsemen promised me a choice horse if I snip one
[Pg 205]
hair from your beard." "Well," quoth the earl, "I
agree thereto; but if you pluck more than one, I
promise you to bring my fist away from your ear!"

And Boice plucked the hair, and won the hobby:
but he took good care to pluck only one, so that his
ear escaped the earl's big fist.

At this time the chief man of the Butlers was
James, earl of Ormond: and he and the Deputy
were at enmity, each working with might and
main to put down the other. The earl of Ormond,
who was a deep and far reaching man, not being
strong enough to oppose his adversary openly,
devised a plan to entrap him by means of submission
and courtesy. Certain charges had, it seems,
been made against Ormond, and he now wrote to
the deputy, who was, of course, in authority over
him, asking permission to come to Dublin to disprove
them; which the deputy granted. Accordingly,
in the year 1492, he marched to Dublin with a
numerous army, and encamped near the city.

Now Kildare's councillors, and the citizens in
general, disliked the presence of so great an army,
suspecting some evil design: and besides, the soldiers
used the people ill, often beating and robbing them;
so that instead of peace, this visit of Ormond made
all the greater discord. Yet still, with an air of
great respect and humility, he persisted in asking
to be heard, saying he would show that the evil
stories about him were all false. At length, Lord
[Pg 206]
Deputy Kildare agreed, and the meeting was held
in St. Patrick's Church.

But this meeting was not a quiet or peaceful one;
for the two earls, instead of speaking gentle words
of forgiveness, began to accuse each other of all the
damages inflicted on both sides. The citizens too, who
were in great crowds around the church, complained
with loud voices of all the ill usage they had suffered
from the soldiers; whereupon they and the soldiers
fell to jars and quarrels, and the whole city was
soon in an uproar. At last, a body of Dublin
archers, enraged that such a disturbance should
be raised by "this lawless rabble," rushed into the
church, shouting out that they would kill Ormond,
as the leader of them, and they shot at random
hither and thither, leaving their arrows sticking in
the timbers and ornaments of the church, but doing
no harm otherwise. It is probable, indeed, that out
of respect to the place, notwithstanding their rage,
they took care to shoot over the heads of the
crowd, so as to kill no one.

On this, the Earl of Ormond, fearing with good
reason for his safety, fled with a few of his followers
to the chapter-house, and slamming the door, bolted
and barred it strongly. Kildare followed and called
to him to come out, promising upon his honour that
he should receive no harm. Ormond replied that
he would come forth if the deputy gave him his
hand that his life should be safe; so "a cleft was
[Pg 207]
pierced in a trice through the chapter-house door,"
to the end that the earls might shake hands and be
reconciled. But Ormond, still suspecting treachery,
refused to put forth his hand, fearing it might be
chopped off, till at last Kildare stretched in his arm
to him through the hole,
and they shook hands.
Then the door was opened
and the two earls embraced,
and the storm was
appeased.



Old Chapter-house Door, now in
St. Patrick&#39;s Cathedral, Dublin.


But though this quarrel
was patched up, it was
only for the time. Kildare
suspected that Ormond had
brought his army with evil
intent "to outface him and
his power in his own
countrie"; while "Ormond
mistrusted that this treacherous
practice of the
Dublinians was by Kildare
devised." So that, as the
old writer goes on to say, "their quarrels were not
ended, but only for the present discontinued: like
unto a green wound, rather bungerlie botcht, than
soundlie cured. And these and the like surmises,
with many stories carried to and fro, and in their
ears whispered, bred and fostered a malice betwixt
[Pg 208]
them and their posterity, many years incurable, which
caused much stir and unquietnesse in the realm."

The old chapter-house door, which is pictured on last
page, still remains in St. Patrick's Cathedral, where
it may be seen leaning against one of the walls, with
the very "cleft" in it through which the two earls
shook hands more than four hundred years ago.


XLIX.

ANCIENT IRISH MUSIC.

From the most remote times the Irish took great
pleasure in music: and they studied and cultivated
it so successfully that they became celebrated every
where for their musical skill. Irish teachers of this
art were thought so highly of that from about the
seventh to the eleventh century, or later, they were
employed in colleges and schools in Great Britain
and on the Continent, like Irish professors of other
branches of learning (see p. 47). Many of the early
missionaries took great delight in playing on the
harp, so that some brought a small harp with them
on their journeys through the country, which no
doubt lightened many a weary hour at their homes
in the evenings, during the time of hard missionary
work. In our oldest manuscript books, music is
continually mentioned: and musicians are spoken
of with respect and admiration.
[Pg 209]

The two chief instruments used in Ireland were
the harp and the bagpipe. The harp was the favourite
with the higher classes, many of whom played it as
an accomplishment, as people now play the piano.
The professional Irish harpers were more skilful, and
could play better, than those of any other country:
so that for hundreds of years it was the custom for
the musicians of Great Britain to visit Ireland in
order to finish their musical education; a custom
which continued down to about a century and a-half
ago.

The bagpipe was very generally used among the
lower classes of people. The form in use was what we
now call the Highland or Scotch pipes&mdash;slung from
the shoulder: the bag inflated by the mouth. But
this form of pipes took its rise in Ireland: and it
was brought to Scotland in early ages by those Irish
colonists already spoken of (page 5). There is
another and a better kind of bagpipes, now common
in Ireland, resting on the lap when in use, and having
the bag inflated by a bellows: but this is a late
invention.

The Irish musicians had various "Styles," three of
which are very often mentioned in tales and other
ancient Irish writings: of these many specimens
have come down to the present day. The style they
called "Mirth-music" consisted of lively airs, which
excited to merriment and laughter. These are
represented by our present dance tunes, such as jigs,
[Pg 210]
reels, hornpipes, and other such quick, spirited pieces
which are known so well in every part of Ireland.
The "Sorrow-music" was slow and sad, and was
always sung on the occasion of a death. We have
many airs belonging to this style, which are now
commonly called Keens, i.e., laments, or dirges.
The "Sleep-music" was intended to produce sleep;
and the tunes belonging to this style were plaintive
and soothing. Such airs are now known as lullabies,
or nurse tunes, or cradle songs, of which numerous
examples are preserved in collections of Irish
music. They were often sung to put children to sleep.
Though there are, as has been said, many tunes
belonging to these three classes, they form only a
small part of the great body of Irish music.

Music entered into many of the daily occupations
of the people. There were special spinning-wheel
songs, which the women sang, with words, in chorus
or in dialogue, when employed in spinning. At
milking time the girls were in the habit of chanting
a particular sort of air, in a low gentle voice. These
milking songs were slow and plaintive, something like
the nurse tunes, and had the effect of soothing the
cows and of making them submit more gently to be
milked. This practice was common down to fifty or
sixty years ago; and many people now living can
remember seeing cows grow restless when the song
was interrupted, and become again quiet and placid
when it was resumed. While ploughmen were at
[Pg 211]
their work they whistled a sweet, slow, and
sad strain, which had as powerful an effect in soothing
the horses at their hard work as the milking songs
had on the cows: and these also were quite usual
till about half a century ago.

Special airs and songs were used during working
time by smiths, by weavers, and by boatmen. There
were besides, hymn tunes; and young people had
simple airs for all sorts of games and sports. In
most cases words suitable to the several occasions
were sung with lullabies, laments, and occupation
tunes. The poem at page 82 may be taken as a
specimen of a lament. Examples of all the preceding
classes of melodies will be found in the collections of
Irish airs by Bunting, Petrie, and Joyce.

The Irish had numerous war-marches, which the
pipers played at the head of the clansmen when
marching to battle, and which inspired them with
courage and dash for the fight. This custom is still
kept up by the Scotch; and many fine battle-tunes
are printed in Irish and Scotch collections of
national music.

From the preceding statement we may see how
universal was the love of music in former days
among the people of Ireland. Though Irish airs,
compared with the musical pieces composed in our
time, are generally short and simple, they are
constructed with such skill, that in regard to most of
them it may be truly said that no composer of the
[Pg 212]
present day can produce airs of a similar kind to
equal them.

There are half a dozen original collections of Irish
music, containing in all between 1000 and 2000 airs:
other collections are mostly copied from these. But
numerous airs are still sung and played among the
people all through Ireland, which have never been
written down; and many have been written down
which have never been printed. Thomas Moore
composed his beautiful songs to old Irish airs; and
his whole collection of songs and airs&mdash;well known
as "Moore's Melodies"&mdash;is now published in one
small cheap volume.

Of the entire body of Irish airs that are preserved,
we know the authors of not more than about one
tenth; and these were composed within the last
200 years. Most of the remaining nine tenths have
come down from old times. No one now can tell who
composed "The Coolin," "Savourneen Dheelish,"
"Shule Aroon," "Molly Asthore," "Garryowen,"
"The Boyne Water," "Patrick's Day," "Langolee,"
"The Blackbird," or "The Girl I left behind me";
and so of many other well-known and lovely airs.

The national music of Ireland and that of Scotland
are very like each other, and many airs are common
to both countries: but this is only what might be
expected, as we know that the Irish and the
Highland Scotch were originally one people.

FOOTNOTES:

[1] It is necessary to know the substance of this first sketch in order
to understand the rest of the book.

[2] Inisfail, one of the old names of Ireland.

[3] Miled, pronounced Mee-l&#277; (two syllables).

[4] The Anglo-Norman Invasion will be found described at page 175.

[5] Demons of the air were evil spirits who were supposed to live,
not in underground places like fairies, but in the air. They were
very much dreaded and hated.

[6] Among the ancient Irish Romantic Tales, three are specially
known as "The Three Sorrowful Stories of Erin," viz. "The
Fate of the Children of Lir," "The Fate of the Sons of Turenn,"
both of which relate to the Dedannans; and "The Fate of the
Sons of Usna," referring to the Milesian people. The greater part
of the "Children of Lir" and the whole of the "Sons of Usna" are
given in this book, translated from the Gaelic. "The Fate of the
Sons of Turenn" is translated in full in "Old Celtic Romances."

[7] Lake Darvra, now Lough Derravaragh, in Westmeath.

[8] The sea between Erin and Alban (Ireland and Scotland) was
anciently called the Sea of Moyle, from the Moyle, or Mull, of
Cantire.

[9] Inish Glora; a small island, about five miles west from Belmullet,
in the county Mayo, still known by the same name.

[10] The Taillkenn, a name given by the druids to St. Patrick.

[11] Three hundred years: the Dedannans were regarded as gods
and lived an immensely long time.

[12] Carricknarone, the "Rock of the Seals": probably the Skerry
rock near Portrush in Antrim: but the old name is now forgotten.

[13] Short Irish poems often began and ended in the same words, as
seen in the above translation.

[14] In Ireland, in old times, the dead were often buried standing up
in the grave. It was in this way Finola and her brothers were
buried.

[15] Ogham, a sort of writing often used on tombstones to mark the
names of the persons buried. It consisted of lines and points
generally cut on the edges of the stone.

[16] Clonard, in Meath, on the Boyne. Bangor, in the Co. Down.

[17] St. Augustine came to England in the year 596&mdash;having been
sent by Pope Gregory&mdash;and converted to Christianity those of the
English who had not been already converted.

[18] Quelna or Cooley, the ancient name of the hilly peninsula lying
between the bays of Carlingford and Dundalk: the name Cooley is
still retained.

[19] The translation that follows is quite new, and is now published
for the first time. On this fine story is founded the poem of
"Deirdre" by Robert Dwyer Joyce, M.D.

[20] Ulaid (pron. Ulla), Ulster.

[21] The druids professed to be able to foretell by observing the stars
and clouds.

[22] "Deirdre" is said to mean "alarm."

[23] That is 1665. This inverted method of enumeration was often
used in Ireland. But they also used direct enumeration like ours.

[24] This and the other places named in Deirdre's Farewell are all in
the west of Scotland.

[25] Irish name Drum-Sailech; the ridge on which Armagh was
afterwards built.

[26] These champions, as well as their wives, took care never to
show any signs of fear or alarm even in the time of greatest danger:
so Naisi and Deirdre kept playing quietly as if nothing was going
on outside, though they heard the din of battle resounding.

[27] The "Three Tonns or Waves of Erin" were the Wave of
Tuath outside the mouth of the river Bann, off the coast of Derry;
the Wave of Rury in Dundrum Bay, off the county Down; and the
Wave of Cleena in Glandore Harbour in the south of Cork. In
stormy weather, when the wind blows from certain directions, the sea
at those places, as it tumbles over the sandbanks, or among the caves
and fissures of the rocks, utters a loud and solemn roar, which in
old times was believed to forebode the death of some king.

The legends also tell that the shield belonging to a king moaned
when the person who wore it in battle&mdash;whether the king himself
or a member of his family&mdash;was in danger of death: the moan was
heard all over Ireland; and the "Three Waves of Erin" roared in
response. See "Irish Names of Places," Vol. II., Chap. XVI.

[28] Slieve Cullinn, now Slieve Gullion mountain in Armagh.

[29] The Red Branch Knights were all pagans; and besides, what
they meant here by revenge was merely punishment for a great
crime.

[30] The Brehon Law: that is, the old law of Ireland.

[31] Van Helmont.

[32] Fena, spelled Fianna in Irish, and pronounced Feena.

[33] The above account of how the Fena hunted, cooked, ate, and
slept is from Keating, who took it from old Irish books.

[34] "The Pursuit of the Gilla Dacker and his horse" is a humorous
story, of which only a few incidents are given here. The Gilla
Dacker was really Mannanan Mac Lir, the Pagan Irish sea-god,
who came in disguise to play a trick&mdash;a sort of practical joke&mdash;on
the Fena. The whole story is given in "Old Celtic Romances."

[35] Knockainey: a hill celebrated in story, rising over the village of
Knockainey, in the Co. Limerick.

[36] Fomor, a gigantic warrior, a giant: its real meaning is "a sea-robber,"
commonly called a Fomorian.

[37] Gilla Dacker means "a slothful fellow"&mdash;a fellow hard to
move, hard to manage, hard to have anything to do with.

[38] The ancient Irish used drinking vessels of various forms and
with several names. A "Drinking-horn" (called a corn: pronounced
curn) was usually made of a bullock's horn, hollowed out, cut into
shape, and often highly ornamented with silver rim, precious stones,
carvings, and other decorations. A beautiful drinking-horn will be
found figured in the "Child's History of Ireland," p. 26. Another
kind of drinking vessel&mdash;the mether&mdash;has been already noticed here
(page 17 above).

[39] In books he is often called Columba; but in Ireland he is best
known by the name Columkille. This is derived from colum [pron.
collum] a dove, and cill, or kill, a church: the "Dove of the church."
This name was given him when a boy from his gentle, affectionate
disposition, and because he was so fond of praying in the little church
of Tullydouglas, near where he was born: so that the little boys
who were accustomed to play with him used often to ask: "Has
our little Colum yet come from the church?"

The sketch given here is taken chiefly, but not altogether, from
Adamnan's "Life of St. Columba." Adamnan was a native of Tirconnell
or Donegal, like Columba himself. He died in the year
703. He was the ninth abbot of Iona, of which Columba was the
first. His "Life of St. Columba" is a very beautiful piece of Latin
composition.

[40] Glastonbury, a town in Somersetshire, in England, where in old
times there was a celebrated monastery, much reported to by Irish
students.

[41] This simple and beautiful narrative of the last days of St.
Columkille, including the two pleasing little stories about the crane
and the old white horse, with the affecting account of the saint's
death, is taken altogether from Adamnan's Life. The circumstances
of Columkille's death are, in some respects, very like those attending
the death of the Venerable Bede, as recorded in the tender and
loving letter of his pupil, the monk Cuthbert. But Adamnan's
narrative was written more than forty years before that of Cuthbert.

Baithen was St. Columkille's first cousin and his most beloved
disciple, and succeeded him as abbot of Iona.

[42] This Alfred must be distinguished from Alfred the Great who
lived two centuries later.

[43] Meath, one of the five Kingdoms into which Ireland was divided.
Ben-Edar, the old name of Howth, near Dublin.

[44] It was translated very exactly into prose in 1832 by the great
Irish scholar Dr. John O'Donovan: the Irish poet James Clarence
Mangan turned this prose with very little change into verse, part
of which is given here.

[45] Cruachan or Croghan in the north of the present Co. Roscommon,
the ancient palace of the kings of Connaught: see page 52.

[46] Slewmargy, now Slievemargy, a low range of hills in Queen's
County.

[47] Only a few of his adventures are given here: but the whole
story of the voyage is in "Old Celtic Romances": see page 164,
farther on.

[48] Thomond, North Munster, namely the present county Clare
and parts of Tipperary and Limerick.

[49] Curragh, a boat made of basket or wicker work, covered with
hides. Curraghs were generally small and light: but some, intended
for long voyages, were large and strong, and covered with
two, or three, layers of hide one outside another. Sometimes the
hides were tanned into leather to give additional strength.

[50] For the Book of the Dun Cow and the Yellow Book of Lecan,
see p. 118.

[51] St. Brendan of Clonfert in Kerry, commonly called Brendan the
Navigator: born in Kerry in 484. He sailed from near Brandon
mountain in Kerry (which is named from him) on his celebrated
voyage of seven years on the Atlantic, in which it is related he saw
many wonderful things&mdash;quite as wonderful as those of Maildune.

[52] The Isle of Finn: i.e. of Finn Mac Cumaill: Ireland (see p. 92).

[53] Fiesole in Tuscany, Italy: pronounced in four syllables: Fee-ess'-o-l&#277;.

[54] In the "Child's History of Ireland" there is a picture of the
round tower and church ruins on this little island.

[55] I.e. enrolled in books under the name of Scotia. The natives
always called it Erin.

[56] Ireland had mines of gold in old times; and silver was also
found. Great numbers of Irish gold ornaments, found from time to
time in the earth, are now preserved in Museums.

[57] Pearls were then found in many Irish rivers; as they are,
sometimes, to this day.

[58] The Venerable Bede, a great English historian, writing in the eighth
century, calls Ireland "a land flowing with milk and honey."

[59] Ireland was noted for the plenty and goodness of its wool.

[60] Ireland had great warriors, and many learned men and skilful
artists (see pp. 20, 47, and 117).

[61] There are no venomous reptiles in Ireland. There were then no
frogs: but these were afterwards introduced from England.

[62] Cong in Mayo, between Lough Corrib and Lough Mask; the
remains of an abbey are there still.

[63] Knockmoy in Galway, six miles from Tuam: the ruins of the
abbey still remain.

[64] Mangan wrote many poetical translations from the Irish, as well
as from the German and other languages. The "Vision of Connaught"
is, however, an original poem, not a translation.

[65] Irish, Ceann [can], meaning 'head,' one of the Gaelic titles for a
chief.

[66] Prince Arthur, the rightful heir to the English throne, was cast
into prison by John: he was soon after murdered, which, it was
believed, was done by John's orders.

[67] At this time the kings of England had a large territory in France
so that quarrels often arose between them and the French kings.

[68] A further account of the Great Earl, and of some of his proceedings,
will be found in the "Child's History of Ireland."

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
