PREFACE.


The play which is presented in this volume is the only
specimen known to me of the native American comedy. It
is of comparatively recent origin, and is composed in a mixed
dialect, a jargon of low Spanish and corrupt Aztec (Nahuatl);
but, both in its history and spirit, it bears so many
marks of native composition, and is so characteristic of the
sort of humor popular with the tribes from whom it was
obtained, that it fairly merits a place in this series of
publications.

The text was obtained in Nicaragua, by the late Dr. Carl
Hermann Berendt. But no translation of any part of it and
no notes upon it were found among his papers. The responsibility
for the rendering rests, therefore, with myself. It
has presented extreme difficulty, owing to the imperfect
condition of the text, the deterioration of the Nahuatl words
and forms, the antiquated and provincial senses of the Spanish
words, and the obscure local references introduced. I would
rather speak of my work as a loose paraphrase, aimed to give
the general sense and humorous tone of the original, than
as a faithful translation.

The text has been printed precisely as in the manuscript, even
obvious errors in spelling and punctuation having been
preserved. Suggestions with reference to these are made in the
notes.

For assistance in translating the Spanish text, I would
acknowledge my indebtedness to Professor Adolfo Pierra, of
Philadelphia, and Dr. F. C. Valentine, of New York, both
of whom have passed considerable periods in Central America.

INTRODUCTION.

§ 1. The Nahuas and Mangues of Nicaragua.


Among the outlying colonies of that important people
whose chief seat was in the Valley of Mexico, and who are
variously known as Aztecs, Mexicans or Nahuas, were several
in Central America. "One of these," writes Mr. Squier,
"occupied the principal islands in the Lake of Nicaragua,
the narrow isthmus which intervenes between that lake and
the Pacific, and probably a portion of the country to the
southward, as far as the gulf of Nicoya. Their country was
less than a hundred miles long, by twenty-five broad; yet
here they preserved the same language and institutions, and
practiced the same religious rites, with the people of the same
stock who dwelt more than two thousand miles distant, on
the plateau of Anahuac, from whom they were separated by
numerous powerful nations, speaking different languages, and
having distinct organizations."[1]

This Nahuatl tribe gave the name to the Province, Nicaragua,
this being, according to some early authorities, the
personal appellation of their chief at the epoch of their discovery,
in 1522, and, according to others, their national name.[2]
For no sufficient reasons, Mr. Squier applied to them the term
Niquirans, and Dr. Berendt Nicaraos, but it seems better to
retain, as distinctive for them, the name Nicaraguans, or, more
specifically, "the Nahuas of Nicaragua." "Nicaragua" is

[vi]
undoubtedly a Nahuatl word, but, as the letter r is not found in
that language, the precise original form is uncertain. Father
Francisco Vasquez explained it as a compound of the Nahuatl
nican, "here," and anahuacos, "here dwell those from Anahuac;"[3]
or it may be from nican and nahua (plural form of
nahuatl), "here dwell those speaking the Nahuatl tongue;"
or, as a personal name of a chief, it may be ni calaquiya,
"I entered into, or took possession."

How it happened that this fragment of the Aztec nation
had become detached from the main body and resident so far
from its central seat, has not been clearly explained. Mr.
Squier and some others have maintained the hypothesis that
the migration of all the Aztec tribes was from south to north,
and that their scattered members in Central America were
bands which had stopped on the road.[4] This opinion, however,
is refuted by the evidence of language, and also by
the unanimous traditions of the Aztecs themselves, both in
Nicaragua and in Mexico.

The Nicaraguans had a very positive recollection that their
ancestors came from Mexico, driven forth by scarcity of food,
and that they wandered along the Pacific shore to the locality

[vii]
in which the Spaniards found them.[5] They remembered the
names of their ancient home, or, rather, of their ancient
kindred, and gave them as Ticomega and Maguateca, locating
them toward the west ("hacia donde se pone el sol"). It is
easy to recognize in these words the Aztec terminations signifying
gens or tribe, mecatl and tecatl, which in the plural drop
the tl. Nor can we be far wrong in identifying magua with
the Aztec maque, upper, above, and tico with tiachcauh, elder
brother, and in translating these names, the one as "the
upper people," i. e., the dwellers on the lofty interior plateau,
and "our elder brothers," i. e., the senior and ranking clans
of their tribe, who remained in Anahuac.[6]

Besides these traditions, the Nicaraguans showed their close
relationship to the Aztecs by a substantial identity of language,
mythology, religious rites, calendars, manners and customs.
We have, fortunately, an unusual mass of information about
them, from an examination of their leading men by the
chaplain Francisco de Bobadilla, in 1528, who took down
their replies with as much accuracy as we could expect, and
whose narrative has been preserved by the historian Oviedo.
They also had retained a knowledge of the Mexican hieroglyphics,

[viii]
and wrote, in books of paper and parchment, their
laws and ritual, their calendars and the boundaries of their
lands.[7]

While this Aztec band thus acknowledged themselves to
be intruders, such appears not to have been the case with
their immediate neighbors to the northeast and southwest.
These were of one blood and language, and called themselves
mánkeme, rulers, masters, which the Spaniards corrupted into
Mangues.[8] The invading Aztecs appear to have split this
ancient tribe into two fractions, the one driven toward the
south, about the Gulf of Nicoya, the other northward, on
and near Lake Managua, and beyond it on Fonseca Bay.[9]
Probably in memory of this victory, the Nicaraguans applied
to them the opprobrious name Chololteca, "those driven out,"
from the Nahuatl verb choloa, and the suffix tecatl, which was
corrupted by the Spanish to Chorotecas.[10]

The name does not by any means intimate that the Mangues
came from Cholula in Mexico, as some ancient, and some

[ix]
modern, writers have hastily supposed;[11] nor is it a proof that
they spoke an Aztec dialect, as Ternaux Compans has
asserted.[12] So far is this from being the case, the Mangue has
no sort of affinity with the Nahuatl, and must stand wholly
asunder from it in the classification of American tongues.
It has, indeed, a relative to the north, and a close one, the
Chapanec or Chiapenec,[13] spoken by the inhabitants of three
small villages in Chiapas, the largest of which has given its
name to the province. These Chapanecs, by their traditions,
still clearly remembered at the time of the Conquest, and
preserved by the historian Remesal, migrated from Nicaragua
to their more northern home. As they had no connection
with the Aztecs, so, also, they were wholly without affinities
with the great Maya stock, which extended far and wide over
Central America, although the contrary has been recently
stated.[14] In fact, among the five different languages which
were spoken in the present province of Nicaragua at the time
of the discovery, not one belonged to any branch of the
Maya group.[15]

[x]

My present theme does not extend to a discussion of these
various tongues, nor take me further into the ethnology of
their locality. It has to do solely with these two nations, the
Nicaraguans and the Mangues. The culture-level of the
former was nearly as high as that found in the Valley of
Mexico. They had a settled government, constructed edifices
of stone, sculptured idols, utensils and ornaments out of the
same material, were skilled in ceramics, deft in weaving cotton
cloth and reed or grass mats, able in war, and thoughtful
enough to puzzle their first European visitors with questions
as to the stars and the earth, the beginning and the end of
things.[16] Careful archaeologists in our own day have searched
the territory they inhabited, and many museums contain specimens
of what they accomplished in the direction of the arts,
and testify to a respectable degree of intellectual advancement.[17]

We know less about the Mangues. They are mentioned as
differing in religious rites from the Nicaraguans, and the
impression is conveyed that they were in a more primitive
condition, but yet with fair claims to be ranked among the
cultivated nations of the new world. Among them, in fact,
Dr. Berendt located one of the "centres of ancient American
civilization," and considered the definite solution of their

[xi]
affiliations as one of the problems of the first order in the
ethnology of America.[18] The Spanish historians relate that
they had hieroglyphic books, like the Mexicans; that they
were rather light in color, careful in dress, setting much store
by their long hair, which they sedulously combed, and had an
autocratic military government. Their country was thickly
peopled, especially that portion of it between the lakes. The
district of Managua was almost like a continuous town, so
closely were the native houses placed together for nearly ten
miles. In fact, it was called one city by the earliest explorers,
and Oviedo, who takes pains to criticise these for their
tendency to exaggeration, estimated the population of this
limited district, at the time of the Conquest, at forty
thousand souls.[19]

At present, scarcely any pure-blood remnants of either of
these nations can be found, and both languages are practically
extinct. When Mr. Squier visited Nicaragua, in 1850, he
obtained, with great difficulty, a short vocabulary of the
Nahuatl dialect, spoken on the island of Ometepec, in Lake
Nicaragua; and, in 1874, Dr. Berendt, only at the cost of
repeated efforts, succeeded in securing from a few survivors
of advanced ages a moderately full collection of Mangue
words and sentences.[20]

To illustrate the practical identity of the Nahuatl of Nicaragua
with that of Anahuac, and the Mangue of Nicaragua
with that of Chiapas, I will insert two short lists of common
words with their equivalents in those four dialects. The first
is from Mr. Squier's works above referred to, the second from
the manuscripts of Dr. Berendt now in my possession.

It needs but a cursory glance at these lists to see that,
while there is scarcely a dialectic difference between the two
Nahuatl columns, and again between the two Mangue columns,
there is absolutely no point of contact between Mangue and
Nahuatl.

The chief differences between Nicaraguan and pure Nahuatl
were, that the former changed the double consonant tl into t,
or dropped it altogether; that the c, ch and q were confounded;
that, in the conjugation, they dropped the prefix
tla, which in pure Nahuatl is employed to indicate that the
inanimate object of the verb is not expressed; that certain
terminal consonants, as x, were dropped; and apparently that
the sounds of s and r, not known to the tongue in its purity,
were introduced.

[xv]
The linguistic relations of the Mangue or Chapanec tongue
have never been ascertained. I have compared it with the
principal stocks in the northern continent, as well as with the
great Tupi-Guarani stem, which has extensive affiliations in
Central America, but without discovering any analogies of
value. It does appear, however, to have a certain, though far
from close, relationship to the Aymara tongue, spoken in the
Peruvian Andes, and especially in the vicinity of Lake Titicaca,
the celebrated site of a remarkable ancient civilization. The
following list of common words seems to indicate this. The
Aymara is taken from the dictionary of that tongue, by
Father Ludovico Bertonio, while the dialects of the Mangue
are discriminated by N, for Nicaraguan, and C, for Chapanec.

[xvi]
There are also various grammatical similarities between the
two tongues. Both are highly synthetic; in both the division
of nouns is "vitalistic," that is, into animate and inanimate;
the numeral system is in both the decimal; in both the
possessive pronoun follows the noun; both possess the inclusive
and exclusive plural; and others could be mentioned.

It is known that the Aymara partakes largely of the
elements of the Qquichua, and by some is classified merely
as a dialect of that tongue. Such similarities as appear to
exist between Mangue and Aymara are, however, less with
the words and forms common to these two Peruvian idioms,
but rather more with those wherein the Aymara differs from
the Qquichua.

With the trenchant differences above indicated, between
the Nahuatl and the Mangue, it is the more singular to observe
how the Nahuatl obtained the preponderance. We may
attribute this to the superior fighting power of the Aztec
invaders; to the fact that many of the native allies of the
Spanish could speak that tongue and not the Mangue; that
the early missionaries came from Mexico; or, that the Nahuatl
was promptly reduced to writing, while the Mangue was not;
or to all these causes combined.[21] Certain it is, that at an
early date a mixed dialect came into vogue, both in the
Mangue districts of Nicaragua and elsewhere in Central
America, composed of a broken-down Nahuatl and a corrupt
Spanish, which, at first, served as a means of communication
between the conquerors and their subjects, and later became,
to some degree, the usual tongue of the latter. The Aztecs
of pure blood spoke contemptuously of this jargon as in
macehuallatolli, the language of slaves, and Father Carochi,
writing little more than a century after the conquest, condemned
[xvii]
it as a hodge-podge of Spanish and Aztec, unintelligible
in either tongue.[22]

This jargon was carried into the various nations who came
into contact with the Spaniards and half-breeds, and hence
we may find scattered words traceable to it in many of their
tongues, and sometimes formulas of a religious, social or
business character.[23]  This is strikingly exemplified among the
Mangues, and the fact is one of considerable interest in connection
with the literary production which is the main topic
of this volume. Even to a recent day, in remote haciendas
of the Province of Masaya, among the descendants of the
Mangues, the traveler might hear the grace before meals,
and other short formulas of the Church, spoken in this
mixed patois.

The following is a specimen:       

Jesu Criste no tecuase + tunanse Santa Maria + el Apostol
Santa Clara nos bendiga esta comida que tienen parte y poder.
Amen.

Here, no tecuase is the Nahuatl no tecuyotzin, Our Lord, and
tunanse is for tonantzin, Our Lady, or Mother.

Another specimen is:       

Marias te cuasti + Marias ticuisti guanse Dios + y Espiritu
Santo.

The correct reading of which should probably be       

Maria tocihuatzin, Maria toquitznitli, yhuan in Dios, yhuan in
Espiritu Santo.

[xviii]
This Nahuatl-Spanish jargon became the lingua franca of
large districts of Central America and Mexico. It was the
current tongue of the half-breeds, and to this day is the patois
of the muleteers who carry on the sparse commerce of the
interior mountainous regions. Many of its Spanish elements
are ungrammatical, and others are long since obsolete in the
classical tongue. It is interlarded with words and whole
phrases borrowed from the Aztec, but with such mutilations
that they are scarcely, or not at all, recognizable. Words
from other native languages have crept in, which adds to the
difficulty of its lexicography. As for the construction, it became
looser and looser, until, in some phrases, all inflectional
elements disappear, and there is a naked juxtaposition of
nominal and verbal roots, the relation of which must be
guessed simply from their sequence.

Probably in none of the Spanish provinces has the Castilian
suffered more from such admixture than in Nicaragua. The
foreign words are there so numerous that the country patois
becomes nearly unintelligible to one acquainted only with
the Spanish of the Academy. Here is the verse of a song,
for example, in that dialect, which will illustrate how far the
amalgamation with the native tongues has gone. The words
in italic are either Nahuatl or Mangue:       


"Casahuyano, mi amor,
Por vos esté payaneado.
No seas tilinte, mi bien."
"Se selegue, dueño amado."


"My love, between girlhood and womanhood,
My heart is breaking for you.
Do not be severe, my loved one."
"I am yet unripe, my beloved master."[24]

[xix]
Another song, in which the lover expresses the strength of
his devotion with more force than elegance, has the following
verse:       


"O fuera yo carángano,
En tus cojines me metería
Para servirte todo el dia.
Te ama este zángano."


Which may be freely rendered       


"Were I a little louse, I'd go
In your puffed and plaited hair;
With you all your toil I'd share;
This lazy fellow loves you so."


The carángano is the name of a species of louse, and the
cojines are the little pads or cushions which women wear in
their hair.

In this dialect several satirical and political songs have
been composed, and, indeed, the licentiate Geronimo Perez,
of Masaya, is stated to have printed in it a political pamphlet,
which I regret not to have been able to obtain.

Such is the jargon in which the Güegüence is written, and
although this medley of tongues can claim no position of
dignity in the hierarchy of languages, it has its own peculiar
points of interest, as illustrating the laws of the degradation       which
is but another term for the evolution and progress       of
human speech. To understand its origin and position as a
literary effort, we must review the development of scenic
representations in that part of the New World.


§ 2. The Bailes, or Dramatic Dances of Nicaragua.

The historian, Fernandez de Oviedo, who was in Nicaragua
in 1529, gives a long account of the dramatic representations,
or rites, accompanied by songs, dances and masked actors,
which he witnessed among the natives of both Nahuatl and
Mangue lineage in that province. They took place at stated

[xx]
seasons, and at certain epochs in the year. The name which
he gives as that by which they were locally known is mitote,
which is the Aztec mitotl, a dance. He himself calls them
areytos, a Haytian word from the Arawack aririn, to sing,
and bailes, which is Spanish, from a classical root, and means
dances.

One which he saw at Tecoatega, at that time a Nahuatl
village, was celebrated at the close of the cacao harvest and
in honor of the god of that plant. It offered a curious
symbolism, which makes us keenly regret the absence of a
full explanation by some learned native. In the centre of
the village square a straight pole was set up about forty feet
in height. On its summit was placed the image of the god,
brilliantly colored, in a sitting position. Around the top of
the pole a stout grass rope was tightly wound, its two free
ends passing over a wooden platform.

When the ceremony began, about seventy men appeared,
some dressed as women, some with masks and head-dresses of
feathers, and all painted skillfully on the naked flesh to imitate
handsome costumes. They danced in pairs, and sang in
chorus certain songs, to the sound of the sacred drums. After
about half an hour, two boys, who had been attached to the
free ends of the rope, threw themselves from the platform
into the air, in such a manner that they turned round and
round the pole, unwinding the rope, and thus gradually
descended toward the ground. One boy held in one hand a
bow, in the other, some arrows; his companion held in one
hand a fan or plume of feathers, in the other a mirror, such
as the natives made of polished obsidian. As they descended,
which, says the narrator, required about as long a time as
one might repeat the Creed five or six times, the dancers
ceased their song, and only the players on the instruments,
some ten or a dozen in number, continued their noise. But,
just as the boys, by the increasing length of the unwound
cord, touched the soil, all present set up a great shout, and
[xxi]
the festival ceased.[25] The cut which I have inserted is taken
from Oviedo's history, and represents the performance.



ANCIENT DANCE IN NICARAGUA.



[xxii]
To one familiar with Nahuatl symbolism, the meaning of
this ceremony is, in a general way, obvious. The seated
divinity on the summit of the pole represents the god of
fertility throned in the heavens. The two boys are the messengers
he sends to earth; the arrows refer to the lightnings
which he hurls below; the feather fan typifies the
breezes and the birds; the mirror, the waters and rains.
After the mortals have prayed in chants, for a certain season,
the god sends his messengers; men wait in suspense their
arrival, whether it shall be for good or for ill hap; and as they
reach the earth, a shout of joy is raised, for the food has
ripened and been gathered in, and the harvest-home is
ended.

In the same century the traveler Giralamo Benzoni, who
visited Nicaragua about 1540, was much impressed with the
native dances. At certain ones, as many as three or four
thousand Indians assembled, some dancing, others playing on
drums, while others, who formed the chorus, carried on the
singing. The dancers displayed great agility, and practiced
a large variety of figures. They were ornamented with
feathers and plumes, and strings of shells were attached to
their arms and legs.[26]

The Mangues of Chiapas, or the Chapanecs, near relatives,
as we have seen, of the Mangues of Nicaragua, were famous
in the days of Thomas Gage, the English priest, who traveled
through Mexico and Nicaragua about 1630,[27] for their dexterity
in games and the elaborate scenery of their dramatic representations.

[xxiii]
"As for acting of Plays," he says, "this is a
common part of their solemn Pastimes."

This passion for scenic performances was by no means
peculiar to these tribes. It extended throughout almost the
whole of the Red Race, and there are many relics of it which
have survived. The older authors refer to it frequently, and
the early missionaries, finding that they could not extinguish
it, sought to turn it to good account by substituting for the
native plays, which were idolatrous or licentious, moral and
instructive pieces. They encouraged the more intelligent
natives and half-breeds to prepare such, and they were acted
in connection with church festivals.

But it would be an error to suppose that these attempts
succeeded completely in abolishing the older forms, or
quenched entirely the tribal historical character of these
ceremonies. Even within our own generation the contrary
of this has been recognized by close observers. Thus the
cura of Jutiapa, a town in Guatemala, Don Jose Antonio
Urrutia, wrote, in 1856: "In most of the Indian towns the
custom is still general of preserving a knowledge of great
events in their history by means of representations, called
bailes (dances), which are, in fact, dances in the public
squares, on the days or evenings of great solemnities. It is
most interesting for one who understands something of the
language to participate in these bailes, as he can thereby
obtain some knowledge of the most remote traditions and
events in the history of the Indians."[28]

Confining our attention to the limits of Nicaragua, we find
that the different bailes represented there within the memory of
persons still living may be arranged in five different classes:       
[xxiv]



 Simple dances.

 Dances with songs.

 Dances with prose recitation.

 Scenic recitations with music, by a single actor. These
are called Logas.

 Complete dramas, with music, ballets, dialogue, and
costumes.


Most of these have a religious purpose. Thus, it is still a
common custom, in case of sickness or impending danger, to
make a vow that, in case of escape, the person will dance
before the image of some saint on a certain day, at a certain
place, usually at a festival.[29] Such dances are sometimes
accompanied with songs or chants of praise, or are performed
in silence. The performer is usually masked or in costume.

It would be erroneous to suppose that there is much gaiety
in their dances. At least, it is not apparent to foreign eyes.
The music is monotonous and almost lugubrious, the singing
is all in the minor key, and the motions are dull, mechanical
and ungraceful. A European traveler has, indeed, characterized
these spectacles rather as an exhibition of profound
melancholy, than outbursts of merriment, and has instanced
them as a proof of the psychical inferiority of the race![30]

Some of them, even to this day, as continued by the lower
half-caste population, are accused of an indecency which may

[xxv]
be a reminiscence of ancient Indian religious rites;[31] for we
know that the native Nicaraguans celebrated a festival strictly
similar to that in ancient Babylon, so condemned by the
prophet, during which every woman, of whatever class, had
the right to yield her person to whom she would, without
incurring blame or exciting jealousy.

The Logas seem to be peculiar to the Mangues. A small
theatre is extemporized, music is provided, and the actor
comes forward, arrayed in some odd garb, and recites a sort
of poem, with gestures and dancing movements. The text
of one of these was obtained at Namotivá by Dr. Berendt,
and is in my possession. It is entitled, Loga del Niño Dios,
and contains about two hundred lines. The language is a
corrupt Spanish, with a number of Mangue words interspersed.
The exordium reads       


"Atienda, Señores,
Pongan atencion
Del Mangue tiyo Pegro
La conversacion."


The theme is an address to the patron saints and the infant
Jesus, but the tone is that of a burlesque, rather than a serious
composition. The costume of the orator, and his surroundings,
the little theatre, the holy infant, etc., are represented
in the frontispiece to this work, from a sketch taken from life.[32]

Frequently a number of persons join in the dance. Such is
one, still occasionally seen, called Las Inditas, the Little
Indian Girls. The period of its celebration is on the day of

[xxvi]
St. Jerome. The women are masked, and wear a loose
mantle, a skirt with lace edging, a sash of rose color, and a
hat with feathers. They carry bouquets and have a silk
handkerchief fastened around the waist, the ends meeting
over the hips. The men are in grotesque costumes, with ugly
masks. They dance in couples, but without touching each
other. The music is the marimba and the guitar. The songs
usually turn on some matter of local interest.

Another favorite dance is the Baile de Chinegritos, celebrated
by the Mangues. This name is applied to the masqueraders
who take part in it. They wear a cap of black straw,
and the body is naked to the waist, and painted. Each
carries a stick or the dried yard of a bull, and in turn lifts a
companion from the ground and strikes him with the whip.
One, who keeps himself apart from the rest, is called the rucia,
or yeguita, the mare. He is in a framework of cane adorned
with women's skirts and colored handkerchiefs, supposed to
represent some animal. There is no fixed day for the dance,
but it is usually carried out in fulfillment of a vow. A variety
of this baile, called Chinegritos à caballo, is performed by
mounted actors, in brilliant costumes, with gaily caparisoned
horses. They are accompanied by music, and draw
up in front of a house, where they sing a song with a monotonous
chorus, le-le-le-le-le-le-le-li-u.

The Baile de Negritos is celebrated on the festivals of St.
James and St. Anna. The participants are on horseback,
themselves and their steeds adorned with bright-colored
sashes and garlands of flowers. They all wear the mosote, or
black straw hat, from which this and the preceding dance
derive their names.[33] The songs which they sing are called
Ensaladas, salads or medleys, and usually contain personal
allusions.

The Baile de Toro-Guaca, the Dance of the Graveyard
[xxvii]
Bull,[34]  as it may be rendered, is presented on the festival of
the Virgin, of St. Jerome, and other days, in accordance
with a vow. It requires fourteen dancers and seventeen
masqueraders. The "bull" is represented by a framework
of reeds, surmounted by a pair of horns and gaily decorated.

Other such exhibitions are called the Baile de diablitos,
Baile de la Yeguita, Baile de San Roman, Baile de San Martin,
Baile del Toro y Venado, Baile del Mantudo (in which
a desperado, with numerous chichiltes, small bells, appears),
besides some representations of Bible scenes, as the combat
between David and Goliath, etc.

Although most of these are accompanied by songs, and
some by dialogues, they do not seem to reach to the height
of a plot, or to the depicting of character or emotion. Beside
them, however, and no doubt to take the place of original
compositions of a similar kind, were complete dramatic
creations.

Many of these were religious or historical plays, arranged
by the clergy, and offer little of interest. But some were
of a secular character, and appear to refer to historical
events.

One was The Ollita or Cañahuate. It was acted in the
Mangue tongue at Masaya as late as 1822, but the text is,
unfortunately, lost. The Ollita is the name of the whistling
jar, on which, and on the drum, a lugubrious musical accompaniment
was played. The name Cañahuate is said to have
been that of a dialect of the Mangue. The plot turned on a
proposed marriage between an old man, richly dressed in
Spanish garb, and a native princess. The chorus and assistants
carried bows, arrows and quivers, which would seem
to point to an early date as that of the supposed transaction.

[xxviii]

§ 3. Nicaraguan Musical Instruments and Music.

The musical instruments of the natives of Nicaragua, mentioned
by Oviedo, are drums, flutes of reeds, and excoletes, or
trumpets. This, however, by no means exhausted the list,
and several others of similar powers have been retained to
the present day, and have been referred to by travelers as local
curiosities. Thus, Mr. Squier writes as follows, in describing
a festival in Leon de Nicaragua: "It is impossible to describe
the strange instruments. One consisted of a large calabash,
over which was stretched the skin of some animal; this, when
pressed in, recoiled with a dull, sullen noise, like the suppressed
bellow of a wild beast, and the wail of some of the long reeds
was like that of a man in the agonies of a violent death."[35]

The memoranda that I have obtained from various sources
enable me to supply this omission of the distinguished traveler,
and to make out the following list, which probably is not
exhaustive.

The most elaborate is the Marimba. Some writers say that
both the name and instrument are of African derivation,
having been introduced by the negroes. Others assert that
the Indians have known the marimba time out of mind, and
undoubtedly invented it. Certain it is, that they develop
singular skill in its management.

A good description and illustration of it are given by von
Tempsky, from whose work I extract them.[36]

"They [the Indians of Central America] are still very fond
of dancing, and are very good musicians, performing on a
peculiar instrument, a native invention of antique date, the
Marimba. A long, horizontal stick supports a number of
jicaras (or long, cylindrical calabashes), arranged near one
[xxix]
another, according to size, from two feet in depth to four or
three inches. Over the mouth of each of them is drawn a thin
piece of bladder, and over it, at the distance of a quarter of
an inch, are flat pieces of a very hard wood, arranged like
the claviature of a piano. These oblong pieces of wood are
supported on a frame of light wood, joined to the long stick
that supports the row of jicaras underneath. Two light legs
sustain the little piano, partly on the ground, and a hoop
connects it with the player, who sits within the hoop, pressing
it on a bench.



A MARIMBA PLAYER AND HIS INSTRUMENT.



"Two long drumsticks, with balls of India rubber at their
heads, are in the hands of the player, who strikes double notes
at every touch of the wooden claviature, with the resounding
jicaras underneath. The sound of this instrument is charming,
clear, limpid in its tones, like the intonation of a harp
string of wire. The Indians produce the justest and sweetest
double notes, and blend a rattling tune together in very
[xxx]
harmonious chords. Their talent for playing this instrument
by ear is astonishing; in a day, they will pick up the most
difficult air, and play it with a good deal of expression,
accompanied with a chant of their own composition."

Instead of calabashes, earthen jars of various sizes are
occasionally used to suspend beneath the key pieces; or, what
in some districts is equally common, they are vertical tubes
of cedar wood (Cedrela odorata). As described by the
traveler Morelet, these tubes are twenty-two in number, all of
equal diameter, varying in length from ten to forty centimeters,
and forming three complete octaves without semitones.[37] In
many of the bailes this is the favorite means of music, and it
is often associated with the guitar.

That it was not unknown to the ancient Aztecs seems
shown from the following drawing from an original Mexican
painting in Duran's Historia, where the player does not appear
to be striking a drum, but the keys of the marimba, or an
instrument of that nature.



ANCIENT AZTEC MUSICIAN.



The Drum was, and remains, a favorite instrument in Central
America. It is usually formed of a hollow piece of wood,
which is struck with sticks. In Nicaragua, however, some of
the natives use a short piece of bamboo, over the ends of
which a skin is stretched. This is held in the left hand and struck
with the tips of the fingers ot the knuckles of the right hand,
keeping time to the chant or sone of the performer,
while he throws himself into striking and extraordinary
attitudes.
[xxxi]



NICARAGUAN INDIANS PLAYING ON THE DRUM.


[xxxii]
The illustration on the preceding page, from a sketch
by Dr. Berendt, shows their manner of performing on this
instrument.

These two varieties of drums were also known to the
ancient Mexicans. They called the one which was struck
with the hand the huehuetle, "ancient object," and that
played by sticks, teponaztli.

The Ollita, or Little Jar, is an instrument still remembered
in Nicaragua, and the drama, in the Mangue dialect, to
which I have referred, bearing this name, proves that it was
familiarly known at Managua early in this century. Its sound
is described as grave and suitable to serious emotions. The
identical ollita which was used in this drama was preserved
long after the last performance of the play (about 1822), in
the chest of the cofradia of San Jose, in Managua; but like
so many other valuable relics, it disappeared in the disturbances
of the republic.

From the name, and from what was told of its powers, it
was evidently not merely a whistle, but a sort of earthenware
flute. Such were known in Peru, and precisely in Nicaragua,
on the island of Ometepec, inhabited at the Conquest by the
Nahuas, such a musical jar was discovered of late years, and
was examined and its musical capacity described by Dr.
Berendt in the following words:       

"Held with the two hands, the lower side turned upward,
and the four holes managed with two fingers on each side,
blowing in the mouth piece yields six different notes. Any
two holes covered give the tonica, one only covered the
secunda, all open the tertia, and by hard blowing a forced
quarta; while all closed produces the dominant (quint) in
the underlying octave. Three holes closed yield notes not
in concordance with the others, varying between an imperfect
sext and a diminished septima of the lower octave. But
[xxxiii]
those mentioned as in accordance permit the playing of many
varied tunes."

The shape of this jar is shown in the following cut, which
was prepared for an interesting article on Indian Music by
Mr. Edwin A. Barber, in the American Naturalist.



EARTHENWARE MUSICAL JAR FROM NICARAGUA.



It was capable of rendering various simple tunes. (See
page v.)



EARTHENWARE WHISTLE FROM NICARAGUA.


The Pito, or Whistle, was a simpler instrument than the
Ollita. It, also, was frequently made of baked clay, and in
odd shapes. The one shown in the following cut was found
on the Island del Zapatero, in Lake Nicaragua, which was
also a possession of the Nahuas.
[xxxiv]






[xxxv]
Two apertures lead into
the cavity of the instrument. When they are closed with the
fingers, a higher note is produced than when they are open.

In the investigations prosecuted in Nicaragua by Dr. J. F.
Bransford, he discovered many of these whistles in ancient
burial mounds. Indeed, in the district of Nicoya, inhabited
at the period of the Conquest by the Mangues, he states that
"every body appeared to have been interred with a small
earthen vessel and a whistle."[38] The latter are usually of odd
shapes, representing some animal.

The following cuts are taken from his report:       



WHISTLES FROM NICARAGUAN BURIAL MOUNDS.



The long Flute, either of cane, or of earthenware, was found
in common use by the early explorers in Central America,
Mexico and Florida. The Nahuas of Nicaragua do not seem
to have made so much use of it as their relatives in Mexico.

The Juco is employed in the noisier dances, such as the
Baile de Diablitos. It is a drinking gourd (nambira), or jar,
over the aperture of which is stretched a skin. This is crossed
by a cord, to which is attached a small piece of wood, which
serves as a clapper when the instrument is shaken.
[xxxvi]
The Quijongo is a stringed instrument, made by fastening
a wooden bow with a stretched cord over the mouth of a jar.
A hollow reed, about five feet long and an inch and a half
thick, is bent by a wire attached to the ends. This wire is
then tied to the reed at one-third the distance from one end,
and at the same point, on the convex surface of the reed, a
gourd, or thin earthen jar, is fastened, with its mouth downward.
The notes are produced by striking the two sections
of wire with a light stick, and at the same time the opening
of the jar is more or less closed by the palm of the left hand,
thus producing a limited number of notes, which are varied
by changing the intervals.



THE QUIJONGO OF NICARAGUA.



Among the Nahuatl tribes of the Balsam coast, this is
called the Carimba. It appears to have been an aboriginal
invention, although some writers have asserted that the Aztecs
had no knowledge of any stringed instrument. Something
like a harp, however, is represented in the following cut, from
the Aztec funerary ritual, where a priest or hired mourner is
shown, chanting the praise of the departed, and accompanying
his words with music, on what appears to be a rude
stringed instrument. (See page xxxvii.)

The Chilchil is a small bell, a number of which are strung
together and shaken. This is an ancient Aztec instrument,
the term for it in Nahuatl being Ayacachtli.

[xxxvii]
The Cacho is a sort of trumpet, constructed of a horn. A
blast upon it can be heard a long distance, and it has thus
become a measure of length, a legua de cacho being the distance
at which one can hear the horn when lustily blown. It
is said to be rather longer than a Spanish league.



AZTEC MOURNER SINGING AND PLAYING.


As to the value of the music which was obtained from
these instruments, it is difficult to arrive at an opinion from
capable judges. Nearly all who have been in a position to
study the subject have lacked acquaintance with the scientific
principles and developmental history of music as an art.

Hence it has usually been stated, and accepted without
inquiry, that the aborigines of America were exceedingly deficient
in musical ability, and that their best efforts rarely went
beyond creating discordant noise. Late investigations by
competent critics have disproved this opinion, and show that
the melodies of the natives are in accordance with a recognized
scale, though not that to which we are accustomed.
For a parallel we must go back to the ancient Phrygian and
Lydian measures, where we shall find a development of the
art in a similar direction to that among the natives of this
[xxxviii]
continent.[39] As is remarked by Mr. A. S. Gatschet, "Although
the Indian uses all the seven notes of our musical scales, he
avoids many of our melodial sequences; the majority of his
tunes follow the dur or sharp scales, and the two-eighths or
two-fourths measure."[40]

In Central America, the native race has a keen musical
sense. Von Tempsky found that they learned by ear, with
great ease, the compositions of Bellini; and in Vera Paz
and among the Lacandons, Morelet heard upon the Chirimoya,
an aboriginal wind instrument, an air which he
characterizes as "very remarkable" and "extremely touching."
What brings this air into relation to my present
theme is the singular fact that it was known as la Malinche,
but Morelet could not learn from what connection.[41] Quite
possibly it was from the character of that name in the play of
Güegüence.





In the public bailes in ancient times, as we are informed by
both Oviedo and Benzoni, the musicians were separated from
the singers and other performers, forming an actual orchestra,
and this is also intimated in the Güegüence. Having thus the
position of a class by themselves, it may fairly be presumed
that they cultivated with assiduity their peculiar art.

In later days, the cofradias, the brotherhoods and sisterhoods

[xxxix]
organized in connection with the churches, made it
part of their business to learn singing and music, so as to
take part in the celebration of church festivals. It was through
these cofradias that the art of playing on the ancient instruments
was preserved. By the loss of influence of the church
at the separation of the colonies from the mother country,
the cofradias were mostly dissolved.[42]

The music which accompanies the ballets in the Güegüence
has been written down, and is familiar to many in Nicaragua.
I have obtained a portion of it, through the obliging efforts
of Dr. Earl Flint, of Rivas, an earnest cultivator in the field
of archaeological research. The score appears, however, on
examination by competent persons, to be probably of Spanish
origin, and it would not be worth while to give more than a
specimen of it. (See p. xl.)
[xl]







[xli]
§ 4. History of the "Baile del Güegüence."

Among the scenic representations which have been preserved
by the descendants of the Mangues, in the ancient
province of Masaya, the only one of length which has been
committed to writing is the Baile del Güegüence, ô Macho-Raton.
Several copies of this exist in manuscript, and from a
comparison of two of them the late Dr. C. H. Berendt
obtained, in 1874, the text which is printed in this volume.
But he did not obtain, nor did he attempt himself, any translation
of any portion of it. He states, positively, that the
Nahuatl parts are not understood by the natives themselves
at the present day. Its antiquity and authorship are alike
unknown. It is certain that it was acted before the beginning
of the present century, but with this single fact its external
history ceases.

Within the memory of those now living, this Baile has
occasionally been acted in fulfillment of a religious vow pronounced
in some emergency of life or affairs. The period
selected for its performance is, usually, at the festival of St.
Jerome, September 30th. The preparations for it are elaborate
and expensive. In former times the rehearsals took
place daily, sometimes for as much as six or eight months
before the public performance. The actors provided their
own costumes, which required a considerable outlay. There
were, however, always plenty of applicants, as it was not only
considered an honor to take part, but also, the patron or
patroness of the festival, who had pledged himself to give the
drama, was expected to furnish refreshments, in the way of
food and drink, at each rehearsal. As the appetites were
usually keen, and the libations liberal, it was almost ruinous
for one of moderate means to undertake it. For that reason,
as Dr. Earl Flint writes me, it has now been dropped, and
will probably not again be brought out, at least, in full.

How far beyond the close of the last century we should
[xlii]
place the composition of the Güegüence is a difficult question.
Dr. Berendt, basing his opinion on what he could learn by
local tradition, on the archaisms of the Spanish construction,
and on other internal evidence, referred it in general terms
to the first periods (los primeros siglos) of the Spanish occupation.
It is probable that we may assign the early portion of
the eighteenth century as the latest date for its composition,
and there is some evidence, which I shall refer to in the notes
to the text, that a more remote period is not improbable.
Of course, it does not contradict this that a few modern
expressions have crept into the text. Nothing else could be
expected.

No hint as to the author is anywhere found. There are,
however, reasons which I consider weighty ones, to believe
that it is the production either of a native Indian or a half-caste.
Several of them are of a negative character, and I
will give these first.

All the dramas, so far as I know, which were introduced by
the Spanish priests as substitutes for the native bailes, are
either religious or instructive in aim. As the Germans say,
they are strongly tendenciös. Such are the Baile de St. Martin,
which gives scenes from the life of the saint, and in which a
wheel, called the horquilla, covered with feathers and flowers,
is drawn along; the Baile de los Cinco Pares de Francia, which
sets forth the conquest of the infidel Moors by the Christians,
both of which plays have been popular in Nicaragua; among
the Kekchis, of Coban, the Baile de Moros y Cristianos, similar
to the last mentioned; the Zaki-Koxol, ô Baile de Cortes, in
Kiche, a copy of which I have, and the like. But in the
Güegüence there is absolutely no moral purpose nor religious
tone; so much, indeed, of the reverse, that we cannot conceive
of its introduction by a priest.

On the other hand, had it been composed by a secular
Spanish writer, we should hardly fail to find it, in a general
way, modeled after the stock Spanish comedy. It differs,
[xliii]
however, in several striking and fundamental features, from
the Spanish models, and these differences are precisely those
which would flow from the native habits of thought. I would
note, first, that while females are introduced, they are strictly
mutæ personæ, even the heroine not speaking a word; that
there are no monologues nor soliloquies; that there is no separation
into scenes, the action being continuous throughout;
that there is neither prologue, epilogue nor chorus; and
especially that the wearisome repetition of the same phrases,
and by one speaker of what a previous one has said       a marked
characteristic of the native scenic orations[43]       are all traits
which we can scarcely believe any Spaniard sufficiently cultivated
to write at all, would exhibit.

Furthermore, the "business" of the play is strictly within
the range of the native thought and emotion. The admiration
of the coarse cunning and impudent knavery of Güegüence
is precisely what we see in the modern camp-fire tales of
Michabo among the Algonkins, of Tezcatlipoca among the
Aztecs, and of a score of other heroes. It is of a piece
with the delight which our own ancestors derived from the
trickeries of Reynard the Fox.

The devices for exciting laughter are scarcely more than
three in number; one the assumed deafness of the Güegüence,
the second, a consequence of this, that he misunderstands, or
pretends to, the words of the other actors, thus giving rise to
amusing quid-pro-quos, and third, the introduction of obscene
references. Of course, I am aware that these are the stock
resources of many European low comedians; but I also
consider it a fact of very considerable importance in deciding
the probable authorship of the play, that all of these, especially
the first two, are prominently mentioned by old authors,
[xliv]
as leading devices of the native Nahuatl comedies. Thus,
Benzoni and Coreal tell us that in the bailes in Nicaragua,
which they witnessed, some of the actors pretended to be
deaf, and others to be blind, so as to excite laughter by their
mistakes.[44] And Father Diego Duran tells us of a native
Mexican comedy, upon which this of Güegüence may, perhaps,
have been founded, full of songs and coarse jests,[45] in which
the clown pretends to understand at cross purposes what his
master orders, transforming his words into others like them.
As to the general leaning to indecent gestures and jokes, it is
frequently commented on by the missionaries, and given as a
reason for discountenancing these exhibitions.

The absence of all reference to the emotions of love, and
the naive coarseness indicated in the passages about women,
point rather to a native than a European hand. They are in
remarkable contrast to the Spanish school of comedy.[46]
The neglect of common rules of Spanish construction seems
to arise from the ignorance of one imperfectly acquainted
with the language, rather than of deliberate purpose. It must
also be remembered that this piece was one acted altogether
by the native Indians, and not by the Spanish population.

[xlv]
Nor are we without examples of persons of native lineage
preparing comedies for their fellows. About 1625, Bartholome
de Alva, a descendant of the native kings of Tezcuco,
wrote three comedies, in Nahuatl, drawing his plots from
Lope de Vega. It is quite as likely that another Alva rose
from the Nahuas of Nicaragua, and prepared for their amusement
the production I now present.

For these various reasons I class it among aboriginal productions.
      

§ 5. The Dramatis Personæ of The Güegüence.

The central figure of the drama, and the personage from
whom it derives its name, is
The Güegüence. This is a Nahuatl word, from the root
hue, old; huehue is "old man;" to this is added what grammarians
call the "reverencial" termination tzin, denoting
reverence or affection, and we have, intercalating the euphonic
n, huehuentzin, which, in the vocative, becomes huehuentzé.
It means, therefore, "the honored elder," or "the dear old
man," and may be used, as it is in the play, either as a proper
name or as a common noun. In his description of the Nahuas
of Nicaragua, Oviedo gives the word huehue, and tells us that
it was applied to certain old men of influential position, who
were elected by the natives as rulers of the villages, and that
they in turn selected the war-chief, whose duty it was to look
to the defence of the community. The name was, therefore,
one familiar to the Nicaraguans, though the character would
seem to be drawn as a burlesque or satire.

He is, in fact, anything but a respectable person. His
indifference to truth, his cynical impudence, his licentious
jokes about and before his sons, and the unscrupulous tricks of
which he boasts, are calculated to detract from the element
of the comic in his portraiture, for those who have been
accustomed to the higher productions of humor. But it would
be an error to allow this sentiment to affect much our estimate
[xlvi]
of the influence of the play. As Lessing very well observes,
the true value of comedy is to train us to see the ridiculous
and the absurd, wherever it is, in flagitious as well as in
merely inconsiderate actions, as thus the observer is prompted
to morality as well as forethought.[47]

As I have said, his character is a marked type of the peculiar
form of humor which the native mind preferred, and of
the class of actions in which it especially found amusement,
to wit, in that jocularity which is assumed to deceive and
get the better of one's neighbor. This is strikingly shown
by the number of words in the Nicaraguan patois which
express such actions. Thus, chamarrear is to take advantage
of some one by a joke; trisca is a conversation in which some
one is made ridiculous; féfere is an idle tale with which a
hearer is cajoled; dar un caritazo is to deceive a person by a
trick, etc. This is the humor in the Güegüence. The old
man nearly always has a selfish aim to gain by his jokes and
his stories; they are intended to further his own interests,
and, at the close of the play, he, on the whole, comes out
victorious by these questionable measures.

As the drama was formerly represented, the Güegüence wore
the most magnificent apparel of any of the actors. Chains
of gold, strings of silver coins, and ornaments of steel draped
his person. Indeed, all the participants vied with each other
in extravagant costumes. Their garments were fantastically
adorned with feathers and flowers, and set off with sashes and
handkerchiefs of brilliant colors.

The two sons of Güegüence, Don Forcico and Don Ambrosio,
are drawn in as strong contrast as possible. The former follows
[xlvii]
the paternal example faithfully, and sustains his parent
in all his tricks and lies; the latter as invariably opposes and
exposes the old man's dishonesty. The bitter words which
pass between them, however, must not be taken in dead
earnest; they, too, are only half serious, and do not lead to
any separation of interests.

The Governor Tastuanes appears on the scene in Spanish
costume, with a staff and sabre. His name, however, seems
to be from the Nahuatl, probably a corruption of tlatoani,
chief, lord.[48] He is little more than a lay figure, designed to
draw forth the ruses of Güegüence.

The Alguacil, the Secretary and Registrar appear in what
is supposed to be full official dress, with their staffs of office.

The mutæ personæ of the drama are the women and the
machos, or mules. Of the former, only one is named, the
lady Suchi-Malinche, daughter of the Governor. She enters
clothed in a sort of tunic, fastened to her person with gay
silken sashes; chains of gold and costly jewels adorn her
garments, and a wreath of flowers crowns her hair. The
latter may be a reference to her name. Suchi is a corruption
of the Nahuatl xochitl, flower; Malinche, it may be
remembered, was the name of the famous Indian girl who served
Cortes as interpreter in his first campaign in Mexico, and
became his mistress. Some have supposed that it was a
corruption of the Spanish Christian name Marina, but, as
Señor Icazbalceta has conclusively shown, it is the name of
one of the days of the Aztec month, malinalli, with the termination
tzin, signifying affection. It was the custom in Mexico
and Central America, and still is in many parts, for the natives
[xlviii]
to name their children after the day on which they were born,
led thereto by certain ancient astrological notions.[49] In
Nicaragua, malinche is also the name of a tree, a species of
Poinciana, which bears a handsome red flower.

The Machos, or mules, are twelve or more in number. They
give the second title to the piece, El Macho raton, an appropriate
translation of which I am at a loss to give. Literally
it means "The Male Mouse." As used at present, it signifies
a masker, or masquerading dress. An acquaintance, who has
lived in Nicaragua, tells me that he has heard the children
call out: "See, there goes the Macho-raton," which would
prove to be an Indian in a fantastic costume. In the play,
they wear heads of skins, imitating those of mules, surmounted
with horns of goats, and a petaca, or wicker basket frame
draped with sashes, etc. In their hands they carry bells.

Among the ancient Nahuas, and probably to this day, there
were various curious superstitions relating to mice. If they
gnawed a hole in the dress of a wife, her husband took it as a
sign that she had been unfaithful to him; and she entertained
the same suspicion were his garments attacked. When food
was attacked by mice, it indicated that the people of the
house would be falsely accused of something.[50]
      

§ 6. Epitome of the Story of The Güegüence.

p. 6.
p. 8.
p. 10.

The Governor and the Alguacil meet and enter
into conversation. The Governor directs that the
[xlix]
songs and dances which are for the diversion of the
Royal Council should cease, and bewails its poverty.
He also directs that no one shall be allowed to enter
his province (or presence?) without a permit from
the patrol. The Alguacil complains that their poverty
is so great that they have no fit clothing, and lays the
blame on Güegüence. The Governor refers to
Güegüence in severe terms, and orders that he be
brought before him, by any means.

Güegüence, who with his two sons is within earshot,
hears the Governor's orders, and pretends to
think that it refers to a calf or a colt.

p. 12
p. 14.
p. 16.
p. 18.
pp. 20-22.
p. 24.
p. 26.
p. 28.

The Alguacil announces himself as a servant of
the Governor. Güegüence professes to understand
that it is a female servant who desires to see him.
The Alguacil corrects him in this, and informs him
that he is to fly to the Governor. Güegüence takes
the word in its literal sense, and chaffs about an old
man flying. The Alguacil suggests to him that he
had better learn how to salute the Governor properly
on entering his presence, and offers to teach
him the customary salutation for a consideration.
This proposal Güegüence accepts, but chooses to
misunderstand the considerations suggested by the
Alguacil, and replies in a series of quid-pro-quos
and gibes. At last, he produces some money, which,
however, he will not pay over until the Alguacil
gives the promised instruction. The Alguacil recites
the formal salutations, which Güegüence pretends to
misunderstand, and repeats, instead, some phrases
of similar sound, which are discourteous to the Governor.
For this the Alguacil threatens to whip him,
and on Güegüence continuing in his taunts, gives
him two blows, and recommences his lesson.

[l]

p. 30.
p. 32.

At this juncture the Governor appears, answers
Güegüence's salute, and asks him why he has entered
the province without a permit. At first Güegüence
answers by relating how he had traveled without a
permit in other provinces. Finding this does not
meet the case, he seeks to turn the inquiry by a
dubious story how a girl once gave him a permit
for something besides traveling. The Governor,
not choosing to be put off with this, Güegüence
proposes they shall be friends, and that the Governor
shall have some of the immense riches
and beautiful clothing which Güegüence possesses.
The Governor expresses some doubt as to this wealth,
and proposes to examine, apart, Güegüence's oldest
son, Don Forcico.

p. 34.

He does so; and Don Forcico corroborates, in the
most emphatic terms, the statements of his father:
"the day and the night are too short to name all
his possessions."

p. 36.
p. 38.

The Governor remains, however, uncertain about
the truth, and requests a similar private talk with
Güegüence's younger son, Don Ambrosio. The
latter tells a very different story, asserting that all
his father's boasts were lies, and that he is, in fact, a
poor, old, thieving ragamuffin. Güegüence, who
overhears him, rails at him as a disgrace to the
family; and Don Forcico assures the Governor, in
very clear terms, that Don Ambrosio has none of
Güegüence's blood in his veins.

p. 40.
p. 42.

To settle the question, Güegüence proposes to
show the Governor the contents of his tent-shop,
and has the two boys bring it forward and raise the
sides. He then offers the Governor several impossible
things, as a star, which is seen through the
tent, and an old syringe, which he suggests might
be profitably applied to the Royal Council. As
[li]
the Governor replies roughly, Geügüence at once
changes the subject to a laudation of the remarkable
skill of Don Forcico in many vocations. The Governor
is interested and proposes to inquire of Don
Forcico himself as to the truth of this. The latter
repeats the boasts, and on the Governor inquiring
as to whether he knows some diverting dances, with
his father and his brother, he dances a ballet.

p. 46.
p. 48.
The Governor wishes to see another ballet, which
the three perform, also; and this is followed by two
others, in which the Governor and Alguacil also
take part.

pp. 50.
pp. 52.
pp. 54.

pp. 56.
pp. 58.
pp. 60.
pp. 62.

Following these the Governor asks for the masquerade
of the macho-raton, or the mules. They are
led in by Don Forcico, and march around the stage.
Güegüence avails himself of this auspicious moment
to ask for the hand of the Lady Suche-Malinche,
the Governor's daughter. The Governor sends the
Alguacil for the Chief Secretary, who returns with
Suche-Malinche and other young women. The Secretary
describes what an elegant costume is expected
of the son-in-law of the Governor, and the latter
suggests that Güegüence has cast his eyes too high.
The old man explains that it was not for himself,
but for Don Forcico, that the request was made,
and pretends to feel quite badly about the marriage.
He, nevertheless, brings up the young women, one
by one, who are rejected by Don Forcico, with very
uncomplimentary remarks, until Suche-Malinche
comes forward, who pleases him, and with whom he
is married. The Governor then suggests that Güegüence
treat the Council with some Spanish wine.
This the old man does not find it convenient to
understand, and when he can no longer escape, and
is at a loss where to obtain the liquor, is
[lii]
relieved by Don Forcico, who has secured it in a
questionable manner.

pp. 64.
pp. 66.
pp. 68.

The mules, that is, the masqueraders who represent
them, are then brought up, and as Güegüence
examines first one and then another, they give him
opportunity for a series of extremely broad jokes
and vulgar allusions.

Finally, the loads are placed on the mules, the
boys mount them and move off, while Güegüence,
having offered his wine to the Governor, the Secretary,
the Registrar and the Alguacil, who each in
turn tell him to be off, leaves the stage shouting to
his sons that they will all have a rouse that will
cost them nothing.

Alg. Something to amuse the Royal Court. It is a
great shame that we have no golden table, no embroidered
table-cloth, no golden inkstand, no pen of gold, no golden
sand-box, not even white paper, and such like suitable
things, for a session of the Royal Court.

Gov. My son, Captain Chief Alguacil, suspend in the
quarters of the leading men the music, dances, songs,
ballets, and such matters, unless the patrol gives a permit
to enter my royal province [for that purpose].

Alg. Yours to command, Governor Tastuanes. I pray
God to protect you. The leading men [shall give no]
music, dances, songs, ballets, and such things, without
[the permission of] the patrol of Governor Tastuanes.

(The patrol is sounded and they dance.)

Alg. Governor Tastuanes, I am here, as is proper, but
the patrol is not; their girdles are in rags and tatters, and
their hats smashed in from their frays, and we have not a
single saddle cloth or red cloak better, perhaps, than that
good-for-nothing Güegüence, Governor Tastuanes.

Gov. My son, Captain Chief Alguacil, you must bring
that pimp, that impudent fellow, that charlatan, before the
Royal Court.

Alg. Perhaps that pimp and charlatan won't come
with me to the Royal Court.

Governor Tastuanes?

Alg. Neither waiter-girl nor washwoman; a servant
of the Governor Tastuanes.

Güe. Then which servant-girl, cook or grub-fixer
of the Governor Tastuanes?

Alg. Let me disclose myself; I have nothing to do
with the grub-fixer; I am the Captain Chief Alguacil of
the Governor Tastuanes.

Güe. Ha! Captain Chief Alguacil of the Governor
Tastuanes! O friend Captain Chief Alguacil of the Governor
Tastuanes, your official staff is perhaps at your

Güe. Friend Captain Chief Alguacil, and what has
Governor Tastuanes to say?

Güe. A-running and a-flying? How does he expect
a poor old man, full of pains and aches, to run and

reaches the door of Governor Tastuanes, what does it do
there?

Alg. It sings and amuses the grandees there.

Güe. That is my consolation and delight. Friend
Captain Chief Alguacil, how about this running and
flying?

Alg. A-running and a-flying, Güegüence.

Güe. Ho, boys! do you speak to me?

Don. Am. Who wants to speak to you, Güegüence,
old humbug?

Güe. Do you speak to me, Don Forcico?

Don For. No, little papa, perhaps it's your ears that
are buzzing.

Güe. That may be, boys. Well, then, look after the
shop, and I will go and see if I can fly.

Alg. Ho, Güegüence! in what style, and with what
etiquette, are you going to enter the royal presence of the
Governor Tastuanes?

Güe. Well, now, how should I, friend Captain Chief
Alguacil?

Alg. First, there should be a song, and such like, to
amuse the Royal Court of the Governor Tastuanes.

Güe. A song, friend Captain Chief Alguacil; then
suspend in the quarters of the leading men the music,
dances, songs, ballets, and such things, to amuse the
Royal Court of the Governor Tastuanes.

Alg. At your service, Güegüence. I pray God to
protect the leading men [and they will suspend] the music,
dances, songs, ballets, and such like, for this good-for-nothing
Güegüence.

(They dance around the stage.)

Alg. Ha, Güegüence! here we are at the place.

Güe. Here we are, with heart of grace.

Alg. At the place.

Güe. To work apace.

Alg. At the place.

Güe. At the place. Now, friend Captain Chief Alguacil,
won't you teach me with what style, and with what
etiquette, I ought to go in and come out of the royal
presence of the Governor Tastuanes?

Alg. Yes, I'll teach you; but not for nothing. First,
I want my salary.

Güe. Salted fish? Ho, boys! are the nets of salted
fish here?



[18]

18

D. Forcico.

Ahi estan, tatita.

D. Ambrosio.

Que redes de pescados salados has de tener, Güegüence,
embustero?

Güegüence.

Como no! mala casta, ojos de sapo muerto! Amigo
Capn  Algl  Mor, ya estamos desaviados de los pescados
salados.

Alguacil.

Acaso no me cele de pescados salados, Güegüence.

Güegüence.

Pues, y como, amigo Capn  Algl  Mor?

Alguacil.

Reales de plata, Güegüence.

Güegüence.

Ha! redes de platos. A! muchachos, ahí estan las
redes de platos?

D. Forcico.

Ahi estan, tatita.

Güegüence.

Pues, amigo Capn  Algl  Mor, ya estamos aviados de
platos. Y como de que platos quiere? de la china, ó de
barro?

Alguacil.

Ayugama, no me cele de platos, Güegüence.

Güegüence.

Pues, y como, amigo Capn  Algl  Mor?

Alguacil.

Pesos duros, Güegüence.



[19]

19

Don For. Here they are, little papa.

Don Amb. What nets of salted fish do you pretend to
have, Güegüence, you old humbug?

Güe. Why not, you bad breed, you evil-eyed brat?
Friend Captain Chief Alguacil, we are just now out of
salted fish.

Alg. Perhaps I don't care for salted fish, Güegüence.

Güe. Well, what then, Captain Chief Alguacil?

Alg. Pieces of eight, Güegüence.

Güe. Ha! dishes and plates. Ho, boys! have we
some dishes and plates?

Don For. Here they are, little papa.

Güe. Well, then, Captain Chief Alguacil, we are supplied
with plates. What kind of plates do you want,
china plates or earthen plates?

Alg. Neither one nor the other. I don't care for
plates, Güegüence.

Güe. Well, what then, Captain Chief Alguacil?

Alg. Hard pieces, Güegüence.



[20]

20

Güegüence.

Ha! Quesos duros de aquellos grandotes. A, muchachos,
ahi estan los quesos duros que trajimos de sobornal?

D. Forcico.

No, tatita; se los comió mi hermanito, Don Ambrosio.

D. Ambrosio.

Que quesos duros has de tener, Güegüence, embustero?

Güegüence.

Como no, mala casta, despues que te los has comido.
Amigo Capn  Algl  Mor, ya estamos desaviados de los
quesos duros, porque ahi traigo un muchacho tan ganzo,
que no me deja nada.

Alguacil.

Acaso no me cele de quesos duros, Güegüence.

Güegüence.

Pues, y como, amigo Capn  Algl  Mor?

Alguacil.

Doblones de oro y de plata, Güegüence.

Güegüence.

Ha! dobles. A! muchachos, sabes doblar?

D. Forcico.

Si, tatita.

Güegüence.

Pues dobla, muchachos, Dios persogue á mi amigo
Capn  Algl  Mor, que ahora endenantes estuvimos tratando
y contratando con el, y ya se lo llevó una bola de fuego
á mi amigo.

Alguacil.

Para tu cuerpo, Güegüence. Acaso no me cele de
dobles.



[21]

21

Güe. Ha! hard cheeses; those big ones. Ho, boys!
have we those hard cheeses which we brought along as
extras?

Don For. No, little papa, my little brother, Don Ambrosio,
ate them up.

Don Am. What hard cheeses do you pretend to have,
Güegüence, you old humbug?

Güe. Why not, you bad breed, since you ate them
up? Friend Captain Chief Alguacil, we are just now
out of hard cheeses, because I have a boy here who is
such a hog that he leaves me nothing.

Alg. Perhaps I don't care for hard cheeses, Güegüence.

Güe. Well, what then, Captain Chief Alguacil?

Alg. I want toll of gold and silver, Güegüence.

Güe. Ha! toll. Ho, boys! do you know how to toll?

Don For. Yes, little papa.

Güe. Well, then, toll away, boys, for God has got
after my friend the Captain Chief Alguacil, with whom
we were talking and bargaining a moment ago, and has
carried off my friend in a ball of fire.

Alg. May it burn your body, Güegüence. Perhaps I
don't care for tolling.



[22]

22

Güegüence.

Pues, y como, amigo Capn  Algl  Mor?

Alguacil.

Doblones de oro y de plata, Güegüence.

Güegüence.

Doblones de oro y de plata! Pues hableme recio, que
como soi viejo y sordo, no oigo lo que me dicen; y por
esas tierras adentro no se entiende de redes de platos, ni
de pescados salados, ni de quesos duros, ni de dobles, sino
onzas de oro y moneda de plata. Y, vamos, ¿cuanto
quiere?

Alguacil.

Todo lo que hubiere en la bodega, Güegüence.

Güegüence.

¿Todo, todo?       ¿No me dejas nada?

Alguacil.

Nada, nada, Güegüence.

Güegüence.

Ni batuchito?

Alguacil.

Ni batuchito, Güegüence.

Güegüence.

Ya lo ven, muchachos, lo que hemos trabajado para
otro hambriento.

D. Forcico.

Así es, tatita.

D. Ambrosio.

Así lo mereces, Güegüence, embustero.

Güegüence.

Arra ya, mala casta, comeras tus uñas.



[23]

23

Güe. Well, what then, friend Captain Chief Alguacil?

Alg. Doubloons of gold and silver.

Güe. Doubloons of gold and silver! Then speak loud,
for I am old and deaf; and in these inland places people
know nothing of nets of plates, and of salted fish,
nor about hard cheeses, nor about tolls, but only about
ounces of gold and coins of silver. Well, let us come to
it, how much do you want?

Alg. Everything in the shop, Güegüence.

Güe. Everything? Everything? You won't leave me
anything?

Alg. Nothing, nothing, Güegüence.

Güe. Not so much as an empty box?

Alg. Not even an empty box, Güegüence.

Güe. Now, boys, you see how we have worked to feed
another hungry fellow.

Don For. So it is, little papa.

Don Am. So you deserve, Güegüence, you old humbug.

Güe. Get out, you bad breed, you shall eat your finger
nails.



[24]

24

D. Ambrosio.

Las comeremos, Güegüence.

Güegüence.

Pues, ponga las manos: y las dos manos pone el
hambriento, y que buenas uñas se tiene mi amigo Capn
Algl  Mor, parecen de perico-ligero! a! una bomba caliente
para estas uñas!

Alguacil.

Para tu cuerpo, Güegüence.

Güegüence.

Pues, tome! Uno, dos, tres, cuatro. Ha! mi plata,
muchachos! Cuatro cientos y tantos pesos le he dado á
mi amigo Capn  Algl  Mor       Vd., amigo Capn  Algl  Mor,
no sabe cual es real, ni cual es medio.

Alguacil.

Como no? Si, entiendo de todo, Güegüence.

Güegüence.

La mitad de este medio hacen dos cuartillos; un cuartillo
dos octavos, un octavo dos cuartos, un cuarto dos
maravedis, cada maravedi dos blancos.

Alguacil.

Pues, échelos todos.

Güegüence.

Pues, enséñeme.

Alguacil.

Pues, azetagago.

Güegüence.

Pues, maneta congon.

Alguacil.

Matateco Dio mispiales, Sor. Gobor Tastuanes.



[25]

25

Don Am. Let us eat them, Güegüence.

Güe. Then put out your hands, and let this hungry
fellow put out both his hands; and my! what fine nails
has my friend, the Captain Chief Alguacil! They are
like those of a scratching monkey! Ho, there! a hot
shot for these nails!

Alg. May it burn your body, Güegüence.

Güe. Well, here then [shows four coins]. One, two,
three, four. Ha! my money, boys! Four hundred and
some odd dollars I have given to my friend, the Captain
Chief Alguacil. But you, friend Captain Chief Alguacil,
you don't know a real from a half a one.

Alg. Why not? I understand all about them, Güegüence.

Güe. The half of this half real makes two cuartillos;
a cuartillo is two octavos; an octavo is two quartos; a
quarto is two maravedis; and each maravedi is two
blancos.

Alg. Well, then, down with them all.

Güe. Well then, teach me.

Alg. Well, then, pay attention.

Güe. Well, then, show me.

Alg. I pray God to protect you, Governor Tastuanes.

Docena de cueros? Ha, muchachos, nos faltan reatas
ó cobijones. Aqui el amigo Capn  Algl  Mor nos ofrece
una docena de cueros.

D. Forcico.

Si, tatita.

Güegüence.

Amigo Capn  Algl  Mor, y como de que cueros, ¿de
crudia ó de gamusa?

Alguacil.

Güe. I pray God will make you sing, Tastuanes.

Alg. I pray God to protect you, Governor Tastuanes.

Güe. I pray God to overcome Tastuanes.

Alg. You are stubborn, Güegüence, you need a dozen
hidings.

Güe. Ho, boys! do we need some lines or covers?
Our friend here, the Captain Chief Alguacil, offers us a
dozen hides.

Don For. Yes, little papa.

Güe. How about those hides, friend Captain Chief
Alguacil, are they green or dressed?

Alg. Find out more about them, Güegüence.

(Gives him two blows.)

Güe. Get out! what right have you to beat me when
I have paid? These are not hides, they are blows.

Don Am. So you deserve, Güegüence, you old humbug.

Alg. I pray God to protect the Governor Tastuanes,
those who carry his messages and transact his business,
the regular alcaldes of the Holy Brotherhood, the registrars,

Royal Court of Governor Tastuanes.

Güe. Friend Captain Chief Alguacil, I have given my
money for nothing, if these are to be my words; and shall
I not bargain for a book in Spanish, to read these prayers
out of when I come before Tastuanes?

Alg. Perhaps I may offer you one, Güegüence.

Güe. If anywhere, friend Captain Chief Alguacil       [The
Governor enters abruptly.] I pray God to protect
you, Governor Tastuanes.

Gov. I pray God to prosper you, Güegüence; are you
well?

Güe. I am here, as is proper, [and I pray God to protect]
those who transact the business, the regular alcaldes
of the Holy Brotherhood, the registrars, notaries and
archivists, [by day] and night, in the Royal Court of
Governor Tastuanes.

Gov. Well, Güegüence, who has given you a permit to
enter this royal province.

Güe. God bless me, Governor Tastuanes, what is it to
need a permit?

Gov. A permit is necessary.

Güe. O! God bless me, Governor Tastuanes; when I

anduve por esas tierras adentro, por la carrera de Mexico,
por la Veracruz, por la Vera Paz, por Antepeque, arriando

un mesonero tupile traiga una docena de huevos, vamos
comiendo y descargando y vuelto á cargar, y me voy de
paso, y no es menester licencia para ello, Sor. Gobor
Tastuanes.

Gobernador.

Pues aqui es menester licencia para ello, Güegüence.

Güegüence.

Valgame Dios, Sor. Gobor Tastuanes, viniendo yo por
una calle derecha me columbró una niña que estaba
sentada en una ventana de oro, y me dice: que galan el
Güegüence, que bizarro el Güegüence, aqui tienes bodega,
Güegüence, entra, Güegüence, siéntato, Güegüence, aqui
hay dulce, Güegüence, aqui hay limon. Y como soy un
hombre tan gracejo, salté á la calle con un cabriolé, que
con sus adornos no se distinguia de lo que era, lleno de
plata y oro hasta el suelo, y así una niña me dió licencia,
Sor. Gobor Tastuanes.

Gobernador.

Pues una niña no puede dar licencia, Güegüence.

Güegüence.

O valgame Dios, Sor. Gobor Tastuanes, no seremos
guancos, no seremos amigos, y seremos de sones sepanegaligua,

was traveling up country, on the road to Mexico, through
Vera Cruz, and Vera Paz, and Antepeque, driving my
mules, leading my boys, twice Don Forcico comes
across a constable innkeeper who brings us a dozen
eggs; and we go on eating and unloading, and we load
up again, and I go right along, and there is no need of
a permit for it, Governor Tastuanes.

Gov. Well, here there is need of a permit for it, Güegüence.

Güe. God bless me, Governor Tastuanes, as I was
coming up a straight street, a girl who was sitting in a
golden window descried me, and says to me: "What a
fine fellow is Güegüence; how gallant is Güegüence;
here's the shop for you, Güegüence; come in, Güegüence;
sit down, Güegüence; there's sweatmeats here, Güegüence;
there's a lemon here." And, as I am such a funny
fellow, I jumped off, with my riding cloak on, so full of
ornaments that you could not tell what it was, covered
with gold and silver to the ground; and that's the way a
girl gave me a permit, Governor Tastuanes.

Gov. Well, a girl can't give a permit [here], Güegüence.

Güe. O! God bless me, Governor Tastuanes, we won't
be fools; no, we will be friends, and we will bargain
about my packs of goods. In the first place, chests of
gold, chests of silver, cloth of Spain, cloth from smugglers,
vests, feather skirts, silk stockings, golden shoes, beaver

hats, stirrup straps of gold and silver lace, as may satisfy
the clever Governor Tastuanes.

Gov. No, I am not satisfied with what you say,
Güegüence. Don Forcico and Don Ambrosio must give
a truthful account to our Royal Court, whether you have
riches and abundant treasures.

Güe. Do you not know it already, clever Governor
Tastuanes?

Gov. I do not know it, Güegüence.

Güe. Then, if friend Captain Chief Alguacil will suspend,
in my presence, the music, dances, songs and
ballets of the leading men, Don Forcico will give a
truthful account to the Royal Court about my riches and
abundant treasures.

Gov. My son, Captain Chief Alguacil, suspend in the
quarters of the leading men the music, dances, songs and
ballets, and Don Forcico will give a truthful account to
the Royal Court about their riches and abundant treasures.

Alg. At your service, Governor Tastuanes. I pray
God to protect the leading men, and [they suspend] the
music, dances, songs and ballets, and Don Forcico will
give a truthful account.

(The Alguacil takes Don Forcico aside to talk with the Governor.)

Don For. I pray God to protect you, Governor Tastuanes.

Gov. I pray God to prosper you, Don Forcico; are

Don For. I am here, as is proper, [and I pray God to
protect] those who carry the messages, those who transact
the business, the regular alcaldes of the Holy Brotherhood,
the registrars, notaries and archivists, [by day] and
night, in the Royal Court of Governor Tastuanes.

Gov. Well, Don Forcico, you are to tell me the truth
about the stories which Güegüence tells, saying that he
is a rich man, and has property, and handsome and
beautiful things; in the first place, chests of gold, chests
of silver, doubloons of gold, coins of silver; so tell me
clearly, Don Forcico.

Don For. O! God bless me, Governor Tastuanes, the
day and the night are too short to tell you all the riches
of my father. In the first place, chests of gold, chests
of silver, cloth of Spain, cloth from smugglers, stirrup
straps of lace of gold and silver, as may satisfy the clever
Governor Tastuanes.

Gov. No, not satisfied yet, Don Forcico; for next,
your little brother, Don Ambrosio, will give a truthful
account to the Royal Court about these riches and
abundant treasures.

Don For. Governor Tastuanes, if friend Captain Chief
Alguacil will suspend in the quarters of the leading men
the music, dances, songs and ballets, my little brother,
Don Ambrosio, will give a truthful account.

ballets, and his little brother, Don Ambrosio, will give a
truthful account of the riches and treasures.

Alg. At your service, Governor Tastuanes. I pray

(The Alguacil takes Don Ambrosio aside to talk to the Governor.)

Don Am. I pray God to protect you, Governor Tastuanes.

Gov. I pray God to prosper you, Don Ambrosio; are

Don Am. I am here, as is proper, [and I pray God to
protect] those who carry the messages, those who transact
the business, the regular alcaldes of the Holy Brotherhood,
the registrars, notaries and archivists, [by day] and
by night, in the Royal Court of Governor Tastuanes.

Gov. Well, Don Ambrosio, you are to tell me the
truth about the stories which Güegüence relates, saying
that he is a rich man. In the first place, [that he has]
chests of gold, chests of silver, cloth of Spain, cloth from
smugglers, vests, skirts of feathers, silk stockings, golden
shoes, a beaver hat, stirrup straps of lace of gold and
silver, quantities of pretty things, as that good-for-nothing
Güegüence relates; so tell me clearly, Don Ambrosio.



[38]

38

D. Ambrosio.

Valgame Dios, Sor. Gobor Tastuanes, vergüenza me da
contar las cosas de ese Güegüence embustero, pues solo
está esperando que cierre la noche para salir de casa en
casa á hurtar lo que hay en las cocinas para pasar el, y su
hijo Don Forcico. Dice que tiene cajoneria de oro, y es
una petaca vieja totolatera, que tiene catre de seda y es
un petate viejo revolcado, dice que tiene medias de seda y
son unas botias viejas sin forro, que tiene zapatos de oro,
y son unas chancletas viejas sin suelas, que tiene un fusil
de oro, y es solo el palo, porque el cañon se lo quitaron.

Güegüence.

Ve, que afrenta de muchacho, hablador, boca floja!
revientale, hijo, la cabeza, que como no es hijo mio me
desacredita.

D. Forcico.

Quitate de aquí, mala casta! No se espante Sor. Gobor
Tastuanes en oir á este hablador, que cuando yo anduve
con mi padre por la carrera de Mexico y cuando venimos
ya estaba mi madre en cinta de otro, y por eso salió tan
mala casta, Sor. Gobor Tastuanes.

Güegüence.

Sor. Gobor Tastuanes ya pachigüe muyules teguane

Gobernador.

Pachigüete no pachigüete, Güegüence, asamaquimate

[39]

39

Don Am. God bless me, Governor Tastuanes, I am
ashamed to talk about the affairs of this old humbug,
Güegüence, for he is only waiting until it is dark, to go
from house to house, stealing whatever is in the kitchens,
to keep him and his son, Don Forcico, alive. He says
he has a chest of gold, and it is an old bird-basket; that
he has a silken cot, and it is a dirty old mat; he says he
has silk stockings, and they are old leggings, without
lining; that he has golden shoes, and they are worn out
slippers, without soles; that he has a golden gun, and it
is only a wooden stock, because they took the barrel
away from him.

Güe. Heavens! what an impudent boy, a babbler, a
lying tongue! Break his head, my boy, for no son of
mine would slander me in that way.

Don For. Get out of here, you bad breed. Don't be
shocked, Governor, to hear this babbler; for when I went
with my father on the road to Mexico, when we came
back my mother was big by another, and that is why
this one is such a bad breed, Governor Tastuanes.

Güe. Governor Tastuanes, now are you not satisfied
completely about us, by what Don Forcico told the
Royal Court, that I have quantities of pretty and beautiful
things?

Gov. No, not satisfied; the Royal Court would like
to know it.

Güe. The clever Governor Tastuanes does not know
it. Well, then, let friend Captain Chief Alguacil suspend
in the quarters of the leading men the music, dances,
songs, ballets and talk, and I will open my tent to the
Royal Court.

Gov. My son, Captain Chief Alguacil, suspend in the
quarters of the leading men the music, dances, songs,
ballets and such like, to please this good-for-nothing
Güegüence, and he will show his tent, to please the Royal
Court.

Alg. At your service, Governor Tastuanes. I pray
God to protect the leading men, [and they suspend] the
music, dances, songs, ballets and talk, [to show] the tent
to the Royal Court.

(Güegüence and the boys dance around the stage with the tent.)

Güe. I pray God to protect you, Governor Tastuanes.
Let me offer you my tent, to show to the Royal Court.
Heft it, boys. See what pretty things! In the first
place, a chest of gold, a chest of silver, vests, feather
skirts, silk stockings, golden shoes, a beaver hat, stirrup
straps of lace of gold and silver, quantities of pretty
things, Governor Tastuanes. Let me offer you this star
of the morning, which shines from the other side of the
sea; let me offer you this syringe of gold, with which to
medicate the Royal Court of the Governor Tastuanes.

Gov. May it be for your own body, Güegüence.

Güegüence.

Como este mi muchacho tiene tantos oficios, que hasta
en las uñas tiene encajados los oficios.

Gobernador.

Güegüence.

[43]

Güe. It is wonderful how many trades this boy of
mine has. He is deep in trades to his fingers' ends.

Gov. They are of no account, Güegüence.

Güe. Why, he has been a sculptor, a metal founder,
a bell-ringer, and a pilot to the heights which rise above
the clouds, Governor Tastuanes.

Gov. These are not permanent employments, Güegüence.

Güe. Then he has been a carpenter, a maker of yokes,
though of papaya wood, a maker of plows, though of
temple tree wood. This should satisfy the clever Governor
Tastuanes.

Gov. No, I am not yet satisfied. Let Güegüence tell
his son, Don Forcico, to give a truthful account of his
trades.

Güe. Then, if friend Captain Chief Alguacil will, in
my presence, cause the leading men to suspend the music,
dances, songs and ballets, Don Forcico will give a truthful
account of his trades.

Alg. At your service, Güegüence. I pray God will
protect the leading men, [and they suspend] the music,
dances, songs and ballets, for the talk of Don Forcico to
the Royal Court.

(The Alguacil brings Don Forcico forward.)

Don For. Governor Tastuanes, I am deep in trades to
my finger ends.

Gov. They are of no account, Don Forcico.

Don For. Why, I have been a sculptor, a metal
founder, a bell-ringer, and a pilot to the heights which
rise above the clouds, Governor Tastuanes.

Gov. No, I am not satisfied, since Don Forcico should
also know some clever dances and caperings, [to amuse]
the Royal Court.

Don For. O! God bless me, Governor Tastuanes, if
friend Captain Chief Alguacil [will suspend] in the quarters
of the leading men the music, dances, songs and
ballets, they shall have some running dances and such
things, to amuse the Royal Court.

Gov. My son, Captain Chief Alguacil, suspend in the
quarters of the leading men the music, dances, songs,
ballets and talk, in order that this good-for-nothing Güegüence
may amuse [the Royal Court].

Alg. At your service, Governor Tastuanes. I pray
God to protect the leading men, [and they suspend] the
music, dances, songs, ballets and talk, in order that the
good-for-nothing Güegüence may amuse the Royal Court.

[47]

47

Güe. Governor Tastuanes, now you are satisfied that
they have dances and caperings to amuse the Royal
Court.

Gov. No, I am not satisfied. I would know thoroughly
what Don Forcico and Don Ambrosio can do to
amuse the Royal Court.

Güe. Do you not know it, Governor Tastuanes?

Gov. I do not know it, Güegüence.

Güe. Let friend Captain Alguacil Major [suspend] in
the quarters of the leading men the music, dances, songs
and such like, that Don Forcico and Don Ambrosio may
amuse the Royal Court.

Gov. My son, Captain Chief Alguacil, suspend in the
quarters of the leading men the music, dances, songs and
such like, that Don Forcico and Don Ambrosio may
amuse the Royal Court.

(Second ballet of Güegüence and the two boys.)

Güe. Governor Tastuanes, now you are certainly
satisfied that they have dances, have caperings, to amuse
the Royal Court.

Gov. No, I am not satisfied, Güegüence.

Güe. Governor Tastuanes may certainly know that
Don Forcico and Don Ambrosio have dances and caperings,
to the tune of St. Martin, to amuse the Royal
Court.

Gov. I do not certainly know it. My son, Captain
Chief Alguacil, suspend in the quarters of the leading
men [the music, etc.], that this good-for-nothing Güegüence
may amuse the Royal Court with the tune of St.
Martin.

(The tune of St. Martin is played, and they all dance around.)

Gov. Now, Güegüence, I am satisfied that they have
caperings to amuse the Royal Court.

Güe. But I am not satisfied; and, Governor Tastuanes,
my friend, Captain Chief Alguacil, might like to know
how Don Forcico and Don Ambrosio can amuse the
Royal Court, to the tune of Porto Rico.

Gov. My son, Captain Chief Alguacil, suspend in the
quarters of the leading men [the music, etc.], that this
good-for-nothing Güegüence may console [us] with the
tune of Porto Rico.

(An ancient tune is played, and they all dance around.)

Gov. Now, Güegüence, I am satisfied that they have
caperings to amuse the Royal Court.

Güe. But I am not satisfied, Governor Tastuanes, as
some go from behind and others from in front.

Gov. I know nothing about that, Güegüence. Now,
Güegüence, whether they have dances, caperings, like the
macho-raton, to amuse the Royal Court?

Güe. Governor Tastuanes, and good friend Captain
Chief Alguacil, [suspend] in the quarters of the leading
men the music, dances and songs, in order that we may
amuse the Royal Court with the macho-raton. Ho, boys!
how about the mules?

Don For. Here they are, little papa.

(The Valona is played for the mules.)

Güe. Governor Tastuanes, you are certainly satisfied
that they have dances, caperings, finishing touches and
curvetings, like the macho-raton.

Gov. No, I am not satisfied, Güegüence.

Güe. Well, then, Governor Tastuanes, shall we not
make a trade and a treaty between him, without a folly
or a fig-tree, and the lady Suche-Malinche?

Gov. Do you not know of it already, Güegüence?

Güe. I do not know it, Governor Tastuanes.

Gov. My son, Captain Chief Alguacil, suspend [the
labor] in the quarters of the Royal Secretary, and let
him obey our order to enter my royal presence, with the
lady Suche-Malinche.

(The Alguacil goes to speak with the Royal Secretary.)

Alg. I am, as is proper, Mr. Secretary. You will
enter the royal presence of Governor Tastuanes, to obey
his orders, and also the lady Suche-Malinche.

Sec. Well, then, my son, Captain Chief Alguacil, suspend
in the quarters of the leading men the music, the
shoutings, and such like, that I may obey, with the lady
Suche-Malinche.

Alg. At your service, Mr. Secretary.

(The Rujero is played, and the two dance around.)

Sec. I pray God to protect you, Governor Tastuanes.

Gov. I pray God to prosper you, Mr. Secretary; are
you well?

Sec. I am, as is proper, [and come] to obey your
orders, with the lady Suche-Malinche.

Gov. Well, Mr. Secretary, there is a bargain between
this good-for-nothing Güegüence, who is a rich man, and
the lady Suche-Malinche.

Sec. Governor Tastuanes, let the bargain be for clothing,
a petticoat from China, vest, feather skirt, silk stockings,

D. Forcico.

Si, tatita.

Güegüence.

Y con quien me dejas, muchacho?

D. Forcico.

Con mi hermanito, Don Ambrosio.

Güegüence.

Que caso me hará ese jipato!



[55]

55

shoes of gold, a beaver hat, for a son-in-law of
Governor Tastuanes.

(The Secretary returns to his place, dancing with the Alguacil.)

Gov. Ha, Güegüence! it angers me that you choose
so presumptuously.

Güe. Trumpery?

Gov. Presumptuously, Güegüence.

Güe. I have not made any trade or treaty with the
Governor Tastuanes; it must be my boy.

Gov. I don't know about that, Güegüence.

Güe. Ho, boys! what trade or treaty have you with
the Governor Tastuanes?

Don For. For me to get married, little papa.

Güe. For you  to get married! What, boy! a little
chap like you dares to get married?

Don For. Yes, little papa.

Güe. And with whom are you going to leave me
boy?

Don For. With my little brother, Don Ambrosio.

Güe. What care will that imp take of me?



[56]

56

D. Ambrosio.

Y yo tambien me quiero casar.

Güegüence.

Para eso seres bueno. Don Forcico asiguale lichúa

D. Forcico.

No está de mi gusto, tatita.

Güegüence.

Porque, muchacho?

D. Forcico.

Porque está muy pachaca, tatita.

Güegüence.

Pues, que es iguana ó garrobo para que esté pachaca?
Quien la echó á perder, muchacho?

D. Forcico.

Mi hermanito, Don Ambrosio.

Güegüence.

Para eso será bueno este soplado, ojos de sapo muerto,
por eso está tan apupujado. Ve, que bizarra maneca,
muchacho.

D. Forcico.

Si está aventada, tatita.

Güegüence.

Quien la aventó, muchacho?

D. Forcico.

Mi hermanito, Don Ambrosio.

Güegüence.

Como aventastes esta dama, Don Ambrosio?



57

[57]

Don Am. And I too want to get married.

Güe. You're good enough for that. Don Forcico
makes a bargain to choose presumptuously. See what a
gay lady is here, my boy?

Don For. She is not to my taste, little papa.

Güe. Why not, my boy?

Don For. Because she is too much stuffed, little papa.

Güe. Is she, then, an iguana or a garrobo, that she is
stuffed? Who has spoiled her, my boy?

Don For. My little brother, Don Ambrosio.

Güe. For that the bloated fellow is good enough, the
evil-eyed brat; that is the reason he is so played out.
See, here's a gay cake-baker my boy.

Don For. She is puffed up, little papa.

Güe. Who puffed her up, boy?

Don For. My little brother, Don Ambrosio.

Güe. How did you puff up this lady, Don Ambrosio?



[58]

58

D. Ambrosio.

De dormir con vos, Güegüence.

Güegüence.

Callate, mala casta. Ve que bizarra dama, esta otra,
muchacho.

D. Forcico.

Esta, sí, está de mi gusto, tatita.

Güegüence.

Sabes escojer, no muchacho, pero no sabes escojer un
buen machete para hacer un buen desmonte.

D. Forcico.

Tambien, tatita.

Güegüence.

No mocegua, Güegüence.

Güegüence.

No mocegua, Sor. Gobor Tastuanes; lo que siento es mi

Don Am. It came from sleeping with you, Güegüence.

Güe. Shut up, you bad breed. See, my boy, what a
gay lady this other one is.

Don For. This one? Yes, she suits me, little papa.

Güe. You know how to choose, my boy; but you
don't know how to choose a good axe to make a good
clearing.

Don For. That also, little papa.

Güe. Governor Tastuanes, let us make a trade and a
treaty.

Gov. I will make it, Güegüence.

Güe. I will make it, Governor Tastuanes. What I feel
is the loss of my boy.

Gov. I don't know about that, Güegüence.

(The marriage takes place.)

Gov. My son, Captain Chief Alguacil, let it be known
in the quarters of my Royal Province that this good-for-nothing
Güegüence is going to treat the Royal Court to
a yoke of jars of Spanish wine.

Reg. Suspend [business], Mr. Chief Alguacil, and
attend, friend good-for-nothing Güegüence. In the name
of the Royal Court, we give the congratulations, and also



[60]

Ya viene el provincial y no tenemos provision. Amigo
Capn  Algl  Mor, á onde dejó al provincial, en Managua

Alguacil.

Acaso no me cele de bueyes ò de carreta, Güegüence.
Una yunta de botijas de vino de Castilla para en chocolá

Güegüence.

Ya lo ves, muchacho, en que empeño me metes, con ser

Tastuanes, una yunta de botijas de vino de Castilla para
en chocolá del Sor. Gobor Tastuanes; te atreves á buscarla
ó á sacarla, muchacho?



[61]

61

to the lady Suche Malinche, that she may enjoy herself
hugely with Don Forcico, your son, Güegüence.

Alg. Ha, Güegüence! it is known in the Royal Province
of the Governor Tastuanes that you are to obey
him, and treat the Royal Court of the Governor Tastuanes
to a yoke of jars of Spanish wine.

Güe. Ho, boys! you see we are already provided for.
It is a fine thing to be married, but now we have a big
job on hand. The Provincial is coming, and we have not
prepared for him. Friend Captain Chief Alguacil, where
did you leave the Provincial, in Managua or in Nindiri?

Alg. Perhaps I don't care about the Provincial; a
yoke of wine-jars.

Güe. Now you see, boys, a yoke of oxen, and, no
doubt, the cart as well.

Alg. Perhaps I don't care about carts or oxen, Güegüence;
a yoke of jars of Spanish wine for a lunch, to
treat the Royal Court of Governor Tastuanes.

Güe. Now, boy, you see in what a bother you put me
by getting married. Now you see the contribution
which the Governor asks, a yoke of jars of Spanish wine
for the Governor's lunch. Are you equal to hunting for
it, or to getting it, boy?



[62]

62

D. Forcico.

No tengo de onde, tatita.

Güegüence.

Para escojer mosamonte si eres bueno. Te atreves a
buscar una yunta de botijas de vino de Castilla, Don
Ambrosio?

D. Ambrosio.

No tengo de onde, Güegüence.

Güegüence.

Que cosa buena has de hacer, mala casta! Con que,
¿no te atreves, muchacho?

D. Forcico.

No, tatita.

Güegüence.

Pues á ganar ò á perder voy à buscar la yunta de
botijas de vino.

D. Forcico.

No vaya, tatita, ya me avié de la yunta de botijas de
vino.

Güegüence.

A onde te aviastes, muchacho?

D. Forcico.

En casa de un amigo.

Güegüence.

Quien te enseño hacer amigo?

D. Forcico.

Usted, tatita.

Güegüence.

Calla, muchacho, que dirá la gente que yo te enseño á
hacer amigo?



[63]

63

Don For. I don't know whence, little papa.

Güe. You are bold enough to choose [a wife] presumptuously.
Are you bold enough to hunt up a yoke
of jars of Spanish wine, Don Ambrosio?

Don Am. I don't know where, Güegüence.

Güe. What are you good for, you bad breed? Well,
don't you dare to, boy?

Don For. No, little papa.

Güe. Well, then, be it to win or lose, I shall go in
search of the wine myself.

Don For. Don't go, little papa, I have already provided
the wine.

Güe. Where did you get it, boy?

Don For. In the house of a friend.

Güe. Who taught you to make a friend?

Don For. You, little papa.

Güe. Shut up, boy. What will the folks say [if they
hear] that I taught you to make a friend?



[64]

64

D. Ambrosio.

Y pues no es verdad que enseñas á malas mañas á tu
hijo?

Güegüence.

Arra ya, mala casta! malas mañas como las tienes vos.
Amigo Capn  Algl  Mor, ya estamos aviados de la yunta
de botijas de vino, no habrá un macho de la cofradia ò
de la comunidad?

Alguacil.

Vean, que fama de hombre de bien!

Güegüence.

Soy hombre de bien. Traigo mis machos, pero estan
algo raspados desde su cruz hasta su rabo a lichuas diligencia,
amigo Capn  Algl  Mor. Ha, muchachos, que es
de los machos?

D. Forcico.

Ahi, estan, tatita.

Aqui dan una vuelta bailando y cojen los machos.

D. Forcico.

Ya estan cojidos los machos, tatita.

Güegüence.

Encojidos? Será de frio.

D. Forcico.

Los machos ya estan cojidos.

Güegüence.

Cojudos? Pues no eran capones.

D. Forcico.

Cojidos los machos, tatita.

Don Am. And is it not true that you teach your son
evil ways?

Güe. Get out, you bad breed; you are the one with
evil ways. Friend Captain Chief Alguacil, we have now
provided the wine. Have you not a mule of the brotherhood,
or of the village?

Alg. See, what a reputation for an honest man!

Güe. I am an honest man. I have my own mules,
but they are a little raw, from withers to crupper, in consequence
of my energy, Captain Chief Alguacil. Ha,
boys! what about the mules?

Don For. Here they are, little papa.

(They dance around the stage and lead in a number of masks, dressed
as mules.)

Don For. The mules are now driven up, little papa.

Güe. Shriveled up? That must be from cold.

Don For. I say the mules are driven up.

Güe. Livin' studs? Then they were not altered.

Don For. The mules are driven up.



[66]

66

Güegüence.

Cojidos los machos? Pues hableme recio! A onde
estan los machos?

D. Forcico.

Aquí estan, tatita.

Güegüence.

Que macho es este puntero, muchacho?

D. Forcico.

El macho viejo, tatita.

Güegüence.

Y este otro macho?

D. Forcico.

El macho guajaqueño.

Güegüence.

Y este otro macho?

D. Forcico.

El macho mohino.

Güegüence.

Y este otro macho?

D. Forcico.

El macho moto.

Güegüence.

¿Ya aparejaron, muchachos?

D. Forcico.

No, tatita, aparejeselos Vd.

Güegüence.

Todo lo ha de hacer el viejo.

D. Forcico.

Sí, es mejor, tatita.



[67]

67

Güe. Driven up, are they? Speak out loud to me.
Where are the mules?

Don For. Here they are, little papa.

Güe. Which mule is this thin one, boy?

Don For. The old mule, little papa.

Güe. And this other mule?

Don For. That is the dried-up one.

Güe. And this other?

Don For. That is the quarrelsome mule.

Güe. And this other one?

Don For. The rowdy mule.

Güe. Are they harnessed, boys?

Don For. No, little papa; harness them yourself.

Güe. The old man has to do everything.

Don For. Yes, it's better, little papa.



[68]

68

Güegüence.

Ya está sana la cinchera de este macho, muchacho?

D. Forcico.

Ya está, tatita.

Güegüence.

Y este otro macho ¿ya esta sana la riñonada?

D. Forcico.

Ya está, tatita.

Güegüence.

Que sana ha de estar, muchacho, si asi tanta estaca tiene
por delante? A onde se estacó este macho, muchacho?

D. Forcico.

En el potrero, tatita.

Güegüence.

Eso merece por ralirse del potrero á otro potrero. Y
la vaticola de este macho, ya está sana, muchacho?

D. Forcico.

Ya está, tatita.

Güegüence.

Que sana ha de estar, muchacho, si le ha bajado la
flucion por de bajo de las piernas y la tiene muy hinchada?
Reviéntalo, muchacho.

D. Forcico.

Reviéntelo Vd, tatita.

Güegüence.

Ahi se reventará solo, muchacho, que falta?

D. Forcico.

Alzar el fardo, tatita.



[69]

69

Güe. Is the girth-gall of this mule well yet, boy?

Don For. It is, little papa.

Güe. And this other mule, is its backband-gall well
yet?

Don For. It is, little papa.

Güe. How can it be well if it has such a stick in front
of it? Where did this mule run such a stick in itself,
boy?

Don For. In the colt yard, little papa.

Güe. That is what it deserved for running from one
pasture to another. And the crupper-gall of this other
mule, is it now well, boy?

Don For. It is, little papa.

Güe. How can it be well, boy, if the inflammation
has passed down beneath the legs, and there's a great
swelling there? Burst it open, boy.

Don For. Burst it open yourself, little papa.

Güe. It will burst of itself, boy. What's wanting
now?

Don For. Heave up the pack, little papa.



[70]

70

Güegüence.

¿Calentar el jarro?

D. Forcico.

Alzar el fardo.

Güegüence.

Ha! el fardo! A onde está el fardo?

D. Forcico.

Aqui está tatita.

Güegüence.

A mi tiempo, cuando fui muchacho, el tiempo del hilo
azul, cuando me vei en aquellos campos de los Diriomos
alzando aquellos fardos de guayabas,       no muchachos?

Alguacil.

Date priesa, Güegüence.

Güegüence.

Me llevas preso? Porque, amigo Capn  Algl  Mor?

Alguacil.

Que te des priesa!

Güegüence.

Dejeme acordar de mi tiempo, que con eso me consuelo.
Ha! muchachos, para onde vamos, para atras ò
para delante?

D. Forcico.

Para delante, tatita.

Güegüence.

Pues, á la guia, muchachos.

Aqui se montan los muchachos en los machos.

Güegüence.

Muchachos, ¿no habrá un peinador para brindar el
Cabildo Real del Sor Gobor Tastuane?



[71]

71

Güe. Heat up the flask?

Don For. Heave up the pack.

Güe. O! the pack. Where is the pack?

Don For. Here it is, little papa.

Güe. In my time, when I was a boy, in the time of
the blue thread, when I was in those plains of the Diriomos,
lifting those packs of guayabas       isn't it so, boys?

Alg. Hurry up, Güegüence.

Güe. You take me up? What for, friend Captain
Chief Alguacil?

Alg. I mean hurry up.

Güe. Let me recall old times, that I may console
myself with that. Say, boys, do we go in front or
behind?

Don For. In front, little papa.

Güe. Then go ahead, boys.

(The boys mount the mules.)

Güe. Boys, isn't there a cheeky fellow to toast the
Royal Court of the Governor Tastuanes?



[72]

72

D. Forcico.

Si, hay, tatita.

Güegüence.

Señor Gobor Tastuanes, asaneganeme Castilla en
chocola de vino.

Gobernador.

Siguale, Güegüence.

Gobernador.

Sor. Escribano Real, asaneganeme Castilla en chocola
de vino.

Escribano.

Siguale, Güegüence.

Güegüence.

Sor. Regidor Real, asaneganeme Castilla en chocola
de vino.

Regidor.

Siguale, Güegüence.

Güegüence.

Amigo Capn  Algl  Mor asaneganeme Castilla en chocola
de vino.

Alguacil.

Siguale, Güegüence.

Güegüence.

Pues nosotros, á la gorra, muchachos!

      

FIN.



[73]

73

Don For. Yes, there is, little papa.

Güe. Governor Tastuanes, let me offer you some
Spanish wine, as a treat.

Gov. Follow him, Güegüence.

Güe. Mr. Secretary, let me offer you some Spanish
wine, as a treat.

Sec. Follow him, Güegüence.

Güe. Mr. Registrar, let me offer you some Spanish
wine, as a treat.

Reg. Follow him, Güegüence.

Güe. Friend Captain Chief Alguacil, let me offer you
some Spanish wine, as a treat.

Alg. Follow him, Güegüence.

Güe. Then, for us, boys; we'll get it for nothing, and
drink it ourselves.

      

END.




[74]
[75]
NOTES.


Page 4. The Dramatis Personæ. These have been discussed
in the Introduction, page xlv. I may add that the
"Regidor de Cana" may be for "Regidor Decano." Otherwise
I do not see a meaning to it. The term "Alguacil"
might be translated "constable," or "bailiff."

Page 6. The salutations exchanged between the Alguacil
and Governor are repeated frequently between the characters.
In the first, the words would seem to be the Nahuatl matataca,
to beg, to pray, and miecpialia, to watch over, to protect;
in the reply, for the latter is substituted miequilia, to
prosper, followed by qualli, good, or well. The terminal s,
in mispiales, miscuales, is probably a remnant of the Spanish
os, you. No pilse is the vocative nopiltze, my dear son, compounded
of the inseparable possessive pronoun of the first
person, no, and tepiltzin, an affectionate or reverential form,
from the root pilli. The expression need not be taken as
literally meaning relationship, as the Nahuas used the formula
nopiltzintzinê in addressing all persons of position. "Ma moyolicaizin,
Nopiltzintzine, seas bien venido, ó ilustre Señor."
Carochi, Gram. Mex., p. 20.

Ya tiguala neme, I take to be yê tiqualli tinemi, in which yê
is a particle of contraposition, and both the adjective-adverb
qualli, and the verb nemi, to live, to be, are preceded by the
second personal pronoun ti. The compound mascamayagua
appears to be from maxca, yours, literally, your thing (mo,
your, axca, thing), and the optative particle mayecuele,
equivalent to the Spanish ojalá; hence the meaning is
"yours to command," or "at your service."

[76]In his next words the Governor uses a phrase which is
repeated by various speakers with a "damnable iteration"
throughout the comedy. Simocague would, in pure Nahuatl,
be ximocauoltia, the imperative second person singular, of the
compulsive form of mocaua, to cease, to stop, or to suspend
something. The noun mocacaua is the word for the pauses
or intervals in music. The reason for the frequent repetition
of the request, I suppose to be that in the ancient exhibitions
of the drama numerous assistants joined in dancing, singing
and playing on musical instruments; and when a specified
ballet was to be performed, or an important conversation to
be repeated, they were courteously addressed, and requested
to be silent for a time. Dr. Valentine tells me that in
Guatemala the term gente principal is commonly used to designate
the most prominent inhabitants of a pueblo.

Necana y paltechua, Nahuatl words, united by the Spanish
conjunction. The former is Nah. nequaniliztli, dancing
motions; the latter, elsewhere written palechua and paleguisa,
is a corruption of paleuqui, suitable, or appropriate things.
Hemo, a form of Sp. hemos, is an antiquated expression for
tenemos.

The word mo in the expression mo Cabildo Real may be
the Spanish mio, my; or the Nah. mo, thy, thine. The
Cabildo was originally the chapter of a religious house, and
later a council, but at present it is applied in Central America
to the municipal courts, and the house in which they sit.

Page 8. In the second reply of the Alguacil on this page
there are evidently several words omitted which I have supplied
in brackets in the translation. The same has occurred
elsewhere, and it was to be expected, as nearly all the Nahuatl
expressions have become unintelligible to the native
population of the present generation. As most of these formulas
are repeated several times, we can approximate to what the
full expression should be.

Ya nemo niqui nistipampa, is a frequent reply in the play to
a formal salutation of a superior. I have translated it as
some corruption of the Nahuatl words, yê nemonequi
nixtlipampa, literally, "my presence is proper," i. e., "I am
present before you, as is my duty." The Alguacil, as having
charge of the patrol, hastens to speak of its wretched
uniform. The adjective sesule, constantly applied to Güegüence,
evidently in a depreciatory manner, is probably from
the Nah. tçulli, worthless.

[77]
Page 10. While the Governor and Alguacil are conversing,
Güegüence and his sons enter, and overhear the last directions
of the Governor. All three understand whom he
means, but it is the cue of Güegüence to assume a different
signification. To the brusque rejoinder of Don Ambrosio
he pretends to be deaf, and this feigned difficulty of hearing
is depended on as one of the main elements of the comic
throughout.

The epithet mala casta, of bad blood, as applied by
Güegüence to his own (putative) son, becomes intelligible
later in the play, where it is stated that he was begotten
during his legal father's absence in Mexico.

Embustero, which I have rendered "humbug," is more
exactly a boasting, bragging charlatan. Dr. Valentine
suggests "blower," in the slang sense of that word.

Page 12. Asuyungua. The numerous words which begin in
asu, asa, and ase, seem to be compounds with the Nah aço,
"perhaps," used in introducing a positive statement mildly,
or in presenting a question in the form of an assertion, as aço
amo timoçahua, "perhaps you have not fasted," meaning
"you surely have not." (Carochi.) It is usually combined with
other particles, and the analysis of such compounds in the
altered form presented in the text becomes exceedingly
uncertain.

After the announcement of his person and official position
by the Alguacil, Güegüence repeats his titles in a tone of
affected admiration, and inquires after his staff of office,
which was not visible. This staff was all-important to the
dignity of an alcalde or alguacil. In Nahuatl this official is
called topilê, he who carries the staff, from topilli, staff.

Page 14. Güegüence, who has no desire to appear before
the Governor, makes an excuse that he will learn how to fly,
and is about leaving, when he is called back by the Alguacil.
The words te calas, qui provincia real, should probably read,
ticalaquia presencia real, the first from calaquia, to enter, as
on page 8.

Page 16. Having agreed to take a lesson in etiquette,
Güegüence pretends quite to misunderstand the Alguacil,
when he claims pay for his instructions.

[78]Redes, "nets" of salted fish. The reference is to the
method adopted by the Indians of Central America in carrying
burdens. This is in a net which is suspended between
the shoulders by means of a strap which passes across the
forehead. Such a net is called in Nicaragua matate, and in
pure Nahuatl, matlauacalli; the strap or band by which it is
supported is the mecapal, Nah. mecapalli. When the material
to be transported is a fluid, a jar of earthenware is suspended in
the same manner. A small earthenware cup, found in Nicaragua
exhibits this, and also some ingenuity of arrangement. It
represents a woman, with one of these jars on her back, seated.
(See p. 78.)

Page 18. Ojos de sapo muerto, lit. "eyes of a dead toad."
Such eyes were considered to exercise an evil influence, and
to bring bad luck.

Page 20. Doblar. This Spanish word means to toll a
bell, as at a death. Güegüence chooses to understand the
Alguacil's demand for doubloons to be a request to doblar, and
hastens to announce to his sons that the Alguacil has suddenly
died.



CUP FROM NICARAGUA.



Page 24. The coins which Güegüence names are those of
the old Spanish currency. A cuarto was a brass piece, equal
to a half-penny English, or one American cent (Delpino,
Spanish and English Dictionary, 1763.) It was worth four
maravedis, and eight cuartos equaled a real de vellon.

The phrase maneta congon is of uncertain signification. I
have translated the first word as the imperative form of nextia,
to show, to disclose; congon may perhaps be a corruption of
conetontli, boy.

The Alguacil now begins his instruction, and repeats, for
the benefit of Güegüence, the proper salutation which should
be used in addressing the Governor. The old man pretends
to misunderstand them, and makes use of other words, similar
in sound, but of an insulting signification. I have not succeeded
in showing, in the English text, this play upon words.

[79]
Page 28. Asonesepa negualigua, etc. This passage has proved
unintelligible to me, and the rendering is little more than a
guess. The phrase is the same as at the foot of p. 30.

In the midst of the conversation the Governor suddenly
appears, and Güegüence turns to him with the customary and
proper salutation, thus showing that his desire for instruction
from the Alguacil was a sham.

On the phrase te calas qui provincia real, see the Notes to
page 14.

Page 30. Mesonero, a person who owns or has charge of
a meson, a house in which the poorer classes of travelers
sleep, providing their own food, and that of their beasts (Dr.
Valentine). For tupile see Vocabulary.

Antepeque or Tecoantepeque, the seaport of Guaxaca.
Thomas Gage, who visited it in 1625, wrote of it: "This
Port of Tecoantepeque is the chief for fishing in all that
country; we met here in the ways, sometimes with fifty,
sometimes with a hundred mules together, laden with nothing
but salt fish for Guaxaca, the City of Angels, and Mexico."       A
new Survey of the West Indies, p. 195. (London, 1699.)

Dulces are sweetmeats of various kinds, eaten usually
between meals. Squier remarks: "The Spanish taste for
'dulces' long ago passed into a proverb, but it rather surpasses
itself in Nicaragua. The venders of 'dulces', generally
bright Indian girls, gaily dressed, and bearing a tray,
covered with the purest white napkins, and temptingly spread
upon their heads, pass daily from house to house; and it is
sometimes difficult, and always ungallant, to refuse purchasing
something from their stock."       Nicaragua, Vol. I, p. 275.

[80]The punctuation toward the foot of the page should probably
be, "no seremos guancos; no; seremos amigos," etc. The
guipil de pecho is the short upper jacket worn by the women.
A guipil de pluma is a skirt woven of feathers. In ancient
times, these garments, skillfully constructed of the beautiful
plumes of tropical birds, were esteemed as the most valued
articles in the treasures of kings, and the most magnificent of
royal costumes. The art of feather-weaving continued for
some generations after the Conquest. Indeed, as late as 1840
one family in Mechoacan preserved it. The reference to it
in the text, however, is a sign of antiquity, as it has long since
disappeared in Central America. See an interesting monograph
on the subject by the eminent French antiquary, Ferdinand
Denis.       Arte Plumaria; Les Plumes, leur Valeur et
leur Emploi dans les Arts au Mexique, au Perou, etc. Paris,
1875.

Page 32. Much of this page is rendered with doubtful accuracy,
as the text is very obscure.

Page 34. Hay me sagua, the same as hoy melague, p. 36;
hoy, Spanish, now, to-day, melaua, Nah., to speak out, or
openly.

Page 40. The reference to the star would seem to be
that when the tent is opened a star is visible through it, which
Güegüence offers to the Governor.

Para tu cuerpo, "an extremely filthy expression." (Dr.
Valentine.)

Page 42. Seran de arena. "They may be of sand," i. e.,
they are of no value or importance.

Yugos de papayo, yokes of papaw wood, a soft wood, worthless
for the purpose, as is also the wood of the tecomajoche,
the Plumeria, for plows. The intimation is that Don Forcico
was smart enough to cheat his customers.

The Nicaraguan plow is a wooden instrument of the most
primitive construction. The following cut from Mr. Squier's
work represents one.



A NICARAGUAN PLOW.



Page 48. The tunes mentioned, the St. Martin, the Valona,
the Porto rico and others, are still preserved in Nicaragua.

Page 50. Sin tuno, sin tunal. An obscure phrase which
none of my advisers can explain. Tuna is the prickly pear,
tunal, the plant that bears it, various species of Opuntia.
Tuna, in the university slang, means beggarly, reckless;
"estudiantes de la tuna," mendicant or vagabond students.
(See Don J. Arias Giron, Costumbres Salamanquinas.)

Page 54. When the Governor uses the Nahuatl word
mocemati, presumptuously, Güegüence feigns to understand
him to say desmonte, which means, in Nicaraguan Spanish, a
clearing, and also the worthless waste products thrown out of
a mine.

[81]
Page 56. Güegüence leads in several girls, and presents
them to Don Forcico, which gives the pair an opportunity
for some coarse jokes. Pachaca, stuffed up, here meant in
the sense of being with child. Iguana ô garroba, the latter
the male of the iguana, a thick tree lizard of the tropics.
Aventada, puffed up, taken in the same sense as pachaca.

Page 58. The machete, which I have translated "axe,"
is a long, heavy knife or cutlass, in extensive use in Spanish
America, for domestic and agricultural purposes. It is shown
in the following cut.



THE MACHETE.


Una yunta de botijas de vino, a yoke or brace of wine jars,
probably so called from having been carried by a neck yoke,
one suspended on each side.

Page 60. The Alguacil speaks to Güegüence of toasting,
brindar, the Court, and Güegüence feigns to hear him speak
of the provincial or ecclesiastical officer in charge of the
province. It is an example of assonance which is lost in the
translation. Managua and Nindiri are towns in the Mangue
district of Nicaragua. See the map on page xii.

The next affected misunderstanding of the old man is to
take una yunta de botijas, a yoke of bottles, for una yunta de
bueyes, a yoke of oxen.

Page 62. Hacer amigo, to make a friend. This is the
phrase which is used by courtezans with reference to securing
a male patron to pay their expenses, and for that reason
Güegüence affects to be shocked by the employment of it by
Don Forcico.

Page 64. The words of the Alguacil, "What a reputation,
etc.," are with reference to the charge of Don Ambrosio,
that Güegüence had taught his son evil ways.

The introduction of the mules, i. e., the actors dressed as
mules, as described on page xlviii, is the occasion of several
extremely obscene puns and allusions.

[82]
Page 68. Potrero, colt-yard, or pasture-lot, a play on the
similarity of the word to puteria, a brothel. The estaca referred
to is, of course, an obscene allusion, as is also the
fluccion por debajo de las piernas, i. e., the scrotum.

Page 70. El tiempo del hilo azul. This idiom has foiled
all whom I have consulted. Dr. Valentine thinks it refers to
the season of the year when the verdure reappears after the
drouth. F. Diego Duran states that the village conjurors
were accustomed to suspend charms to the necks of boys by
blue and green threads. (Historia de las Indias de la Nueva
España. Tom. II, p. 275.) Thus understood, the time of
the blue thread would be equivalent to boyhood.

Campos de los Diriomos. The Mangue word Diriomo
means the hill of abundance, or of great fertility. The
locality so named is shown on the map, page xii.

Guayaba. This is the fruit of the guayabo tree, the
Psidium pyriferum. It is red in color, and about the size of
a small apple.

Page 72. A la gorra, literally "for the cap," an idiom
meaning that one receives something merely for taking off
the cap; a gratuity. Dr. Valentine, however, writes me:
"I understand nosotros á la gorra to mean 'then we shall
have to do without.'"




[83]
VOCABULARY

OF

Nahuatl and Provincial, Unusual or Antiquated Spanish Words.


A


Apupujado, Sp. Worn out, played out.

Arra! "Get up! Get along!" A cry of the muleteers to their
animals.

Asa       . The various words beginning thus are compounds
commencing with the Nah. aço, which expresses a
doubt, or implies a question, == perhaps, maybe. Olmos
says: "Quiere decir por ventura, respondiendo ô
dudando."       Gram. Nahuatl, p. 179.

Asama       . This prefix to various words is the Nah. açoma,
which is a strengthened form of aço.       Carochi,
Gram. Mex., p. 181. The syllable ma is also the
sign of the imperative.

Asamaquimate, Nah. A compound of açamo, as above,
and mati, to know. The qui is the objective
pronoun of the third singular, him, her,
it, that; but its employment in this connection is incorrect.

Asamatimaguas, or        timagas, Nah.  Probably from
açoma (see above), and either temachtico, to
come to teach, or tell; or temaca, to give
something to a person.

Asanecaneme, see Asaneganeme.

Asanegaguala, see Asanegualigua.

[84]
Asaneganeme, Nah. Probably aço ni ca nemactia, the last
word meaning to give or offer something to
another, "perhaps I may offer something," == "May I offer you some?"

Asanegualigua, Nah. Probably aço and necuilhuia, to deal,
bargain, treat for.

Asanese, Nah. p. 42. A compound of aço and some unknown
word. Probably == asones, q.v.

Asetato, Sp. ant. and prov. for sientate, sit down.

Asiguala, Nah. From aço and perhaps qualani, to grow
angry (?).

Asones, Nah. From aço, and probably nechca or nepa, adverbs
of place and time, "these," "then," "once," "formerly."
Sometimes it is written à sones, and asonesepa.

Asuyungua, Nah. Compound of aço and noyuhqui, thus, in
this manner (? Cf. Carochi, Gram. Mex. p. 190).

Ayugama, Nah. == ayoccampa, nowhere, not at all, never.

Azetagago, Nah. Apparently a corrupt form from acicacaqui,
to understand.


B

Batuchito, Sp. prov. A small box, in which money, etc., is kept.


C

Cabildo, Sp. A chapter; a council. In Central America, the
municipal court. See p. 76.

Cabriolé, Sp. A kind of riding coat; "a narrow riding coat
without sleeves." (Delpino, Span. Dict.)

Campaneme, ?. p. 28. Probably for campamento.

Cana, Nah. A particle, expressing doubt, "any time," "anywhere."
Cuix cana otimoyolcuiti, Have you confessed
anywhere? It cannot begin a sentence, but must always
follow some other word (Carochi, Gram. Mex., p. 158).

Cele, Sp. prov. A form of zelar, to be zealous for, to be
anxious for; no me cele, I do not very strongly desire;
used ironically.

Chiguigua, Nah. Perhaps ti calaquia, you will enter in.

Chiquimate, Nah. From mati, to know, qui, objective.

[85]
Chopaquimate, Nah. Quimati, see above. Chopa and chi
seem to be personal forms.

Chocola, Nah. Chocolatl, a drink made from cacao. It has
been doubted whether there was a Nahuatl word in
this form. Don Jesus Sanchez denies it in his
Glosario de Voces Castellanas derivadas del Idioma
Nahuatl, sub voce (Mexico, 1883). But its pure
Nahuatl origin seems to be established by another
writer (An. del Museo Nacional de Mexico, Tom. iii,
p. 86). From the text, its meaning was in a wider
sense a refection in general, just as the English word
"tea" means a meal.

Cinchera, Sp. The portion of the body of a horse or mule
where the saddle girth is fastened.

Cobijones, Sp. Large leather coverings to protect goods, etc.

Cojudo, Sp. Not castrated. Applied to the entire horse, etc.

Columbrar, Sp. To descry, to discern at a distance. "Lo que
veo y columbro, respondió Sancho," etc.       Don
Quixote, Pt. I, cap. xxi.

Congon, Nah. p. 24. Perhaps conetontli, a boy, or young
person.

Consentidor, Sp. A conniver, procurer, pimp.

Corcobios, Sp. Curvetings, gambolings. Applied to the steps

L

Lichua, Nah. Probably an abbreviated form from tla achiua,
to do, or make something; lichua obedecer, to make
to obey.

Linar, Sp. prov. To please, amuse, == consolar, for which it
is used in some districts. (Berendt.)


M

word). See page 81.

Macho, Sp. A male of any animal, especially of a mule; used
generally for mule in the Güegüence.

page xlvii. It may also mean a mouse-colored
jack.

Maneca, Nah. From mana, to make maize cakes, or tortillas;
manacan, one who likes to make such (cf. Carochi,

equivalent to "yours to command," "at
your service," etc.

Matamagueso, see Tumaguiso.

Matateco, Nah. Slightly altered form of matataca, to beg, to
pray, possibly by the addition of the Spanish personal
pronoun, I, "yo."

the possessive of the third person, probably from analogy
with the Spanish su.

Mocegua, or Mosegua, Nah. Apparently from mocenchiua,
to unite in doing something. The n is euphonic,
the composition being ce, one, and achiua, to do.

Mohino, Sp. Applied to a mule proceeding from a stud and

doubtful expression.

Neme, Nah. From nemi, to live, to be (Sp. estar), to dwell.

Nemo, see Niqui.

Niqui, Nah. Found in the construction nemo niqui, which

[89]

and the first possessive pronoun no. The compound
means  "I, present," or "in my presence."

pronoun. See mo. It is also used for the Spanish negative,

tongue, in which this sound is very common.


O

Opa, Nah., oppa, twice.


P

Pachaca, Nah. A derivative from pachiui, to stuff with food,
to satisfy the appetite, etc. The verbal nouns ending
in ca or can usually signify place where, but this is to
be considered a verbal adjective, from the pluperfect
pachiuhca.

Pachigue, or Pachiguete, Nah. From pachiuitia, to satisfy
a person. The frequent expression, pachigue no
pachiguete, should probably be punctuated pachigue?
No pachigutee, == Satisfied? No, you do not
satisfy me.

sepaguala, p. 34, and a sonesepa negualigua, p. 28.

Sp. parleria. No doubt an onomatopoietic word,

verbal forms, is one of past time in the Nahuatl.

[90]
Peinador, p. 70. Perhaps the Spanish word so spelled, which
means a hairdresser, and hence an effeminate person.
But it may be a Spanish form from the Nah. pinauhtia,
to put another to the blush, or out of countenance,
the compulsive form of pinaua, to be ashamed.

Perico ligero, Sp. prov. In Nicaragua, the night-monkey,
Cercoleptes caudivolvulus, which has sharp

another; or from temachti, a teacher, an instructor.

FOOTNOTES:

[1] E. G. Squier, The States of Central America, p. 317 (London, 1858).

[2] The conquest of Nicaragua is described by Oviedo, Historia General
de las Indias, Lib. XXIX, cap. XXI, and Herrera, Decadas de Indias,
Dec. III, Lib. IV, and see Dec. IV, Lib. VIII, cap. X.

[3] "Nicaragua es lo mismo que Nica anahuac, aqui estan los Mexicanos ò
Anahuacos." Fray Francisco Vasquez, Cronica de la Provincia de Guatemala,
Parte II, Lib. V, cap. I (Guatemala, 1716). The form Nicarao,
adopted by Dr. Berendt, is certainly corrupt, as the termination of a proper
name in ao is not found in correct Nahuatl. Squier's term Niquirans was
adopted by him from a misreading of Oviedo, and has no authority whatever;
so, also, his attempted discrimination between Chorotegans and
Cholotecans, as both these are forms of the same word.

[4] "The hypothesis of a migration from Nicaragua and Cuscatlan to
Anahuac is altogether more consonant with probabilities, and with traditions,
than that which derives the Mexicans from the north."       E. G. Squier.
Notes on Central America, p. 349. It is difficult to understand how Mr.
Squier could make this statement in the face of the words of Herrera and
so many other writers.

[5] "La Gente de esta tierra decia, que havia descendido de la Mexicana;
su Trage, i Lengua, era casi, como el de Mexico."       Herrera, Decada III,
Lib. V, Cap. XII. "Dicèn, que huvo en los tiempos antiguos, en Nueva
España una gran Seca, por lo qúal se fueron por aquella Mar Austral à
poblar à Nicaragua."       Id. Dec. III, Lib. IV, cap. VII. Torquemada,
specifically quoting the traditions obtained from the oldest natives, states
that the Nicaraguans came from Anahuac at no remote epoch.       Monarquia
Indiana, Lib. III, cap. XL. See, also, Gomara, Hist. de las Indias,
cap. 206.

[6] Prof. Buschmann, who obtained these names in a garbled form from
Ternaux-Compans' translation of Oviedo, gave them up as insoluble, while
recognizing their value as indicating the wanderings of the Nicaraguans.
"Unglücklicherweise," he says, "sind jene zwei Namen von so ungünstigem
Gehalte, das ich nichts aus ihnen hervorlocken kann."       Ueber die
Aztekischen Ortsnamen, p. 768 (Berlin, 1852).

[7] The careless statement of the historian Herrera, that it was only the
Chorotegans who had such books, can be corrected from his own volumes,
and also from the explicit words of Oviedo and Gomara. Compare
Herrera, Dec. III, Lib. IV, cap. VII, with Oviedo, Hist. de las Indias,
Lib. XLII, cap. I, and Gomara, Hist. de las Indias, cap. 202.

[8] The word mánkeme is a derivative from [chi]imá, the head, whence the
Chapanec d[chi]ämä, the ruler or head man, and mand[chi]ämä, master, chief, in
which word ma is a possessive prefix, and n a particle, sometimes relative,
sometimes euphonic, of exceedingly frequent use in this tongue. It may
be compared to the Nahuatl in.

[9] This latter, or a portion of them, inhabiting a hilly country south of
Masaya, were called Dirians, from the Mangue word diri=, a hill, a name
which has improperly been extended to the whole tribe.

[10] The "compulsive" form of the verb choloa, to run away, is chololtia, to
cause to run away, to drive out. No doubt the name of Cholula (Cholollan)
in Mexico is of the same derivation, but it arose from a different,
though similar, historical event.

[11] Torquemada appears to have been the first to make this guess; and it
has recently been advocated by Dr. Valentini, The Olmecas and the Tultecas,
p. 20 (Worcester, 1883), and was also sanctioned by Dr. Berendt.

[12] In a note to his translation of Oviedo's Nicaragua.

[13] The proper spelling is "Chapanec." It is not an Aztec word, but
from the Mangue tongue, in which Chapa means the ara, or red macaw,
their sacred bird. The name was derived from that of the lofty peak on
which their principal town in Chiapas was situated       chapa niiu, the ara
of fire.

[14] In Mr. Bancroft's Native Races of the Pacific States, Vol. V, p. 659.

[15] The contrary of this has been very positively stated by Dr. Valentini
(ubi supra). The only evidence he brings forward is the word calachuni,
for chieftain, applied by Gil Gonzalez to one of the rulers in Nicaragua.
This is, no doubt, the Maya halach uinic, holy man, but Gonzalez wrote
in 1522, and this word was adopted by the Spaniards in 1518, during
Grijalva's expedition to Yucatan, as the accounts show, and was promiscuously
applied, just as cacique, canoe, etc., from the Haytian dialect. A
careful analysis of all the native words in Oviedo's account of Nicaragua
does not show a single Maya affinity.

[16] The chief asked Gonzalez if, at the end of the world, the earth would
be overturned, or would the sky fall? How large are the stars, why they
move, and what keeps them in their courses? When, and how do the
sun and moon change their brightness? Why is the night dark and the
winter cold, since light and warmth are so much better? (Herrera,
Decad. III, Lib. IV, cap. V.)

[17] The leading authorities on the antiquities of Nicaragua are E. G.
Squier, Nicaragua, Its People, Scenery and Monuments, together with his
numerous other works pertaining to Central America; and the reports of
Dr. Earl Flint and Dr. J. F. Bransford, to the Smithsonian Institution.
Dr. Habel and Dr. Berendt also made numerous investigations, but their
reports have not appeared in adequate detail.

[18] See his essay, Remarks on the Centres of Ancient American Civilization
in Central America, and their Geographical Distribution, in the
Bulletin of the American Geog. Soc. No. 2, 1876.

[19] Historia General de las Indias, Lib. XLII, cap. V.

[20] The older writers have left scant information about these idioms.
Oviedo preserved thirty or forty Nahuatl words, most of which have been
analyzed by Buschman; and Benzoni, in a brief passage, notes the identity
of the Nicaraguan and Mexican. "Chiamano li Signori Tutruane, il
pane tascal, and le galline totoli, and occomaia tanto vuol dire como
aspetta un poco e al infirmita mococoua and al ballare mitote." La Historia
del Mondo Nuovo, p. 103. It is said that a Doctrina was printed in
the Mangue; but the only work on that tongue I know of is the Apuntamientos
de la Lengua Mangue, by Don Juan Eligio de la Rocha (MS.
Masaya, 1842) a fragment of which is in my possession.

Dr. S. Habel, who visited Nicaragua in 1865, in spite of the greatest
efforts, was unable to find a single person speaking Nahuatl; they told him
it was all forgotten.       Archæological and Ethnological Investigations in
Central and South America, p. 24 (Washington, 1878).

[21] The superior position of the Nahuatl among the Nicaraguan languages
was noted by Benzoni, in his visit to that country, as early as about 1550.
He observes: "Parlano in Nicaragua quatro lenguaggi, pero la meglio è la
Messicana, laquale si stende piu di mille e cinquecento miglia di paese
and è la piu facile da imparare."       Istoria del Nuovo Mondo, p. 103
(Venetia, 1565).

[22] "Una mezcla de Castellano y Mexicano, que ni en uno ni en otro
idioma se entiende."       Compendio del Arte de la Lengua Mexicana,
pp. 93, 202.

[23] Speaking of the natives of Nicaragua and Honduras, Father Francisco
Vasquez says: "Muchos de aquellos Indios por la comunicacion que
tienen con gente ladina de las estancias vecinas alcanzan mucho de la
lengua Castellana."       Historia de la Provincia de Guatemala. Parte II,
Lib. V, Trat. I, Cap. 1 (Guatemala, 1716).

[24] This verse is from a song by Dr. Gollena, a highly appreciated poet
of Guatemala, who has written, but I believe never published, some poems
in the Nicaraguan dialect.

[25] Oviedo, Historia General de las Indias, Lib. XLII, cap. XI. Precisely
this baile, or one altogether like it, is described by Diego Duran as
common in Mexico in his day (about 1580). He writes: "Tambien
usaban bailar al rededor de un volador alto vistiendose como pájaros y
otras veces como monas volaban de lo alto de el dejandose venir por unas
cuerdas que en la punta de este palo estan arolladas, desliándose poco à
poco por un bastidor que tiene arriba," etc.       Historia de las Indias de
Nueva España. Tomo II, p. 232 (Mexico, 1880).

[26] Historia del Nuovo Mondo, fol. 103 (Venetia, 1565). Benzoni gives a
wood cut exhibiting the dances, but it is not instructive. Another traveler,
François Coreal, claimed to have visited Nicaragua about 1680, and also
describes the native dances, but in words so similar to Benzoni that it is an
evident plagiarism.       Relation des Voyages de François Coreal aux Indes
Occidentales, Tome I, p. 88 (Amsterdam, 1722).

[27] Thomas Gage, A New Survey of the West Indies, p. 234 (4th Ed.
London, 1699).

[28] Letter to the London Athæneum, 1856, p. 1537. Oviedo also states
that the songs sung at certain bailes were of an historical character, intended
to recall the important incidents in personal and tribal history, "que les
quedan en lugar de historia é memoria de las cosas pasadas."       Historia
General de las Indias, Lib. XLII, cap. XI.

[29] "Hay santos à quienes se hace el voto, en caso de enfermedad ú de
desgracia de ir á bailar ante su imagen, en tal pueblo, el dia de su fiesta,
cuando le sacan procesionalmente."       Pablo Levy, Notas Geograficas y
Económicas sobre la Republica de Nicaragua, p. 281 (Paris, 1873).

[30] "Welligt blijkt de geesteloosheid dezer menschen nit niets zoo zeer
als uit hunne dansen, een vermaak, hetwelk trouwens vrij zeldzaam onder
hen is. Bij het eentoonige geluid van een paar fluiten, en het kloppen op
een hol blok hout, draaijen mannen en vrouwen afzonderlijk, langzaam
en bedaard, in alle rigtingen herom, en schijnen veeleer diepe treurigheid
dan vreugde aan den dag te leggen."       J. Haefkens, Centraal Amerika,
p. 407 (Dordrecht, 1832).

[31] Such dances are the "bailes usados en el populacho, y que estan muy
lejos de brillar por su desencia," referred to by Don Pablo Levy, Notas,
etc., sobre Nicaragua, p. 294.

[32] The word Loga is, I have no doubt, a corruption of the Spanish loa.
The loas in Spain were at first rhymed prologues to the plays, but later
took a more dramatic form and "differed little from the farces that followed
them." See George Ticknor, History of Spanish Literature, vol.
ii, pp. 527-529 (5th edition).

[42] So little is understood about the system of the cofradias, and the point
is one of so much importance in the study of the organization of Spanish
ecclesiasticism in America, that it is worth while to explain it. They are
created by the priest of a parish, in such number as he sees fit, and each
bears the name of a saint or religious occurrence. Each should have, of
male members, a major domo, a steward (prioste), and four or more
appointees (diputados). They attend the priest, serve in the church, aid
in the offices of religion, have a monthly mass, act as choristers, etc., at
fixed periods. Of female members there should be the patroness (patrona
or capitana), and the alguazila mayor, each of whom should have two
special attendants, and there should be other members. Their duties are
to sweep the church, deck it with flowers when necessary, and aid the male
members in their duty. Each cofradia should have its strong box and
financial resources, independently, and the major domo is expected to keep
a book accounting for the funds. I have in my possession such a volume,
in the Chapanec language, the Libro de Cuentas de la Cofradia del Rosario,
1796.

From ten to fifty cofradias were formerly attached to one church, but the
modern curas complain that they can no longer be kept up. "Es verdad,"
exclaims the worthy presbyter Navarro, "que los Sres. Curas, mis antecessores,
y yo, hemos procurado organizarlas de nuevo, pero es moralmente
impossible."       Memoria de la Parroquia de Villa Nueva, p. 18.
(Guatemala, 1868).

Kiche, published by the Abbé Brasseur de Bourbourg, and the translation
of the song of the Uluas of Nicaragua given by Pablo Levy.       Notas sobre
la Republica de Nicaragua, p. 307 (Paris, 1873).

Coreal aux Indes Occidentales depuis 1666 jusqu'en 1697. Tom. I, p. 88
(Amsterdam, 1722). Borrowed, probably, from Benzoni, who says the same.

[45] "Habia un baile y canto de truhanes en el cual introducian un bobo
que fingia entender al reves lo que su amo le mandaba, trastocandole las
palabras."       P. F. Diego Duran, Historia de las Indias de la Nueva
España, Tomo II, p. 231 (Mexico, 1880).

[46] As Mr. George Ticknor very pointedly says, in speaking of the Spanish
drama:       "Above all, it was necessary that it should be Spanish; and
therefore, though its subject be Greek or Roman, Oriental or mythological,
the characters represented were always Castilian, and Castilian after the
fashion of the seventeenth century,       governed by Castilian notions of
gallantry, and the Castilian point of honor."       History of Spanish Literature,
vol II, p. 539 (5th edition).

[47] Speaking of the comedy, he says:       "Ihr wahrer allgemeiner Nutzen
liegt in dem Lachen selbst, in der Uebung unserer Fähigkeit das Lächerliche
zu bemerken; es unter allen Bemäntelungen der Leidenschaft und
der Mode, es in allen Vermischungen mit noch schlimmern oder mit
guten Eigenschaften, sogar in den Runzeln des feierlichen Ernstes, leicht
und geschwind zu bemerken."       Hamburgische Dramaturgie, 29 Stück.

[48] Tlatoani means, literally, "the speaker," from tlatoa, to speak, to ask,
but it is translated by the Spanish lexicographers "gran señor." The
chiefs were probably so called, from their right of speech in the assemblies.
Benzoni gives something like this as the title of the Nicaraguan chiefs.
"Chiamano li Signori Tutruane," which I suspect is a misprint for Tattruani.       Istoria
del Mondo Nuovo, p. 103 (Venetia, 1565).

[49] Icazbalceta's discussion of the name may be found in his notes to the
Diálogos de Francisco Cervantes Salazar, p. 181 (Mexico, 1875). Malinalli
is the twelfth day of the Mexican month. According to Duran, the word
means underbrush (matorral), and the prognostic was, that those born on
that day should have an annual attack of sickness, like this underbrush,
which dries up, or loses its leaves yearly.       Historia de la Nueva España,
Tomo II, p. 261 (Mexico, 1880).

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
