A DESPERATE GAME.



SCENE I.—A Drawing Room at Mrs.
Somerton’s; a fire-place at C. with a bell rope on each side of
it; doors R.&nbsp;C. and L.&nbsp;C.;
above the door R.&nbsp;C. a small window; window  span
class="stage">R.&nbsp;2&nbsp; span
class="stage">E.; a clock on the mantel-piece; a work table  span
class="stage">L., on which is a writing desk; another table in  span
class="stage">C. of the stage, with papers, books, &amp;c. strewed on it; chairs,
&amp;c., &amp;c.; another door at R.&nbsp; span
class="normal">2&nbsp;E. Stage dark. A loud ringing at
door bell heard.

RAT. (outside) Now then, my good friend, a
little quicker, if you please. (enters at door, L.&nbsp;C.,
in over coat, whiskers, and moustache; he is closely followed by D span
class="smallerfont">AVID, who carries a lantern)

DAVID. But, zur, zur, don’t ye be in such a hurry.

RAT. (throwing a hasty look round the room,
then—aside) Come, I’ve effected an entrance, at all events! so far, so well, provided
I’m not compelled to beat a retreat before I’ve accomplished my object. (walks to
various parts of room, examining, &amp;c., &amp;c.)

DAVID. (all this time examining R span
class="smallerfont">ATCLIFFE from head to foot with his lantern—aside) Well,
this be about the free and easiest chap I ever cut in with; he almost pulls the gate bell
down to begin with, and when I opens the door—thinking in course it’s missus come home—in
he walks, and without so much as rubbing his boots on the door mat, tells me to light him
up stairs, at four o’clock in the morning, too. (aloud) Who be ye, zur? I know it
don’t become a servant to be inquisitive—so if you’ll only tell me who ye be, what ye be,
why you come here, what you want here, where you come from, and a few other
particklers, I’ll be satisfied and ask no questions.

RAT. (aside) I must get rid of this fellow.

DAVID. If you want missus, she be gone from home. She
be at a grand ball, and if she finds you here when she comes home, she’ll blow me up in
fine style, as sure as my name’s——

RAT. David!

DAVID. (astonished) He knows my name!

RAT. (turning towards D span
class="smallerfont">AVID) Now hark ye, David. There’s nothing more offensive to me,
David, than familiarity in a servant, David; but in consideration, David, of your having
only recently entered Mrs. Somerton’s service——

DAVID. He knows that, too.

RAT. And you’re being naturally a stupid thick-headed
fellow.

[Pg 4]

DAVID. Dang it, he knows all about me.

RAT. I have no objection to look over it this once,
but the next time it occurs, David, I shall discharge you, David!

DAVID. Discharge me! You? (suddenly) Lud a
mercy—in course, I know who ’ee be now!

RAT. (alarmed) The devil you do.

DAVID. Ees, you be he.

RAT. Oh! I’m he, am I?

DAVID. Ees. I should have known ’ee again directly,
only I never seed ’ee before.

RAT. (aside) That’s lucky!

DAVID. Why missus has been expecting of you the last
three days. It was only just afore she went out she said to me, “David,” said she, “if my
cousin should happen to arrive from London before I get home, show him every attention,”
says she!

RAT. (aside) Her cousin, egad! he takes me for
that simpleton Percy Postlethwaite; not very complimentary, perhaps, but decidedly lucky!
(aloud) Yes, David, here I am, at last; and how is Mrs. Somerton?

DAVID. Mrs. Somerton! is that the way you speak of
your cousin? go along, do. (poking RATCLIFFE in
the side) Ah! Mr. Percy Postlethwaite, you be a lucky young chap to get such a wife, I
can tell ’ee.

RAT. (aside) Wife! so, so, Mr. Percy
Postlethwaite, matters are in a more forward state than you led me to believe.

DAVID. You’ll find supper all ready for ’ee in the
library, (pointing) so I’ll just light the candles.

RAT. By all means, David. (aside) He does’nt
know me.

DAVID. (while lighting the candles) Missus ’ll
be mortal glad to see ’ee, and as for Peggy, she won’t know whether she be standing on her
head or her heels.

RAT. I’m sure I’m very much obliged to Peggy.
(aside) Who’s Peggy?

DAVID. And no wonder; she tells me many’s the time
she’s dangled ’ee on her knee, afore ye were breeched; (imitating) but ye know all
about that.

RAT. Of course. I’ve the most distinct recollection of
everything that happened to me before I was breeched.

DAVID. (having lighted candles) There, and now
I’ll go down stairs and wait for missus; and as soon as she comes in, I’ll say to
her——

RAT. Not one word, either to her or to Peggy! I wish
to give them both an agreeable surprise, David; you understand, eh?

DAVID. (hesitating) I think I do!

RAT. (giving him money) There’s a crown for
you—think again.

DAVID. (pocketing money) I’m sure I do! I’ll be
as dumb as an oyster. (going—stops) As I said before, supper be all ready in
t’other room, (going—stops) and if ’ee want anything you needn’t ring for me,
’cause I be going to take a bit of a snooze before the kitchen fire. (yawning) How
sleepy I be to be sure.

Exit at door, L.&nbsp;C.

[Pg 5]

RAT. (watching D span
class="smallerfont">AVID out, then goes quickly up and closes the door)
Alone at last—now then to work. (takes a pair of pistols from his coat pocket, which he
places on table) But first, as ladies invariably fly to the bell ropes to raise an
alarm, I must take the liberty of cutting these. (taking knife out of his pocket, and
cutting the bell ropes) Now to examine the means of escape, in case of
interruption—(opening window and looking out)—the garden—a small conservatory
underneath—that’s awkward; but, luckily, there’s an apple tree so conveniently close as to
make a very tolerable ladder on an emergency, so far perfectly satisfactory—and if my
information is only tolerably correct, and it ought to be considering the trouble I’ve had
in obtaining it, (taking small pocket book from his waistcoat and opening it) this
door should lead to Mrs. Somerton’s chamber—(opening door at  span
class="stage">L., and looking in)—exactly, and very elegantly appointed indeed.
(closes door, and again looking at his pocket book)—“near the door a
table”—precisely—(laying his hand on the table)—“on the table a small writing
desk”—here it is—(laying his hand on the writing desk)—locked, and the key taken
out, that of course I expected; but as I have ascertained that between the hours of 12 and
1 yesterday it became the temporary receptacle of a pocket book containing bank notes to
the amount of fifteen thousand pounds, it is not likely I should come unprovided with the
means of securing such a treasure. (takes out a bunch of small keys, some of which he
tries—produces a chisel from his coat pocket, and is about to insert it under the lid of
the box, a loud ring at gate bell heard) Mrs. Somerton returned. (runs to door,
L.&nbsp;U.&nbsp;E.—ring repeated) Again!
Stay—(listening) The window—quick! (runs to window) A man in the garden, and
cautiously making towards this window. Who can he be? and what can be his object? Not the
same as mine surely—egad, that would be comical enough. If I could only observe—— Ah—that
door. (blows out the candle, and gropes his way to door, R.;
at the moment that he enters the room, R., P span
class="smallerfont">OSTLETHWAITE’S head is seen
at the window, R.&nbsp;U.&nbsp;E.)

POS. I’ve done it! I’ve been ringing at the bell long
enough, so I’ve been obliged to effect an entrance by the window; (putting one leg over
the window sill) and let me observe to the inexperienced in these matters, that the
fact of threading one’s way up a densely wooded apple tree on a pitch dark night is a
gymnastic feat more easily imagined than accomplished. (gets in at window—he has a
carpet bag) However, as I said before, I’ve done it, and what’s more I live to tell
it, though I may be allowed to remark that, considering my cousin, Mrs. Somerton, has been
expecting me—me, her affianced husband—for the last three nights, I think she might
have allowed one of her domestics to sit up for me: however, I’m not going to quarrel with
her, no—no—I cannot forget that she’s my cousin, and the only child of my honoured and
lamented uncle—I mean aunt—no, uncle—and now that the law suit has been decided in her
favour, and that she steps into possession of fifteen thousand pounds, her late husband’s
fortune, I feel that to upbraid her at such a moment would be unmanly. span
class="pagenum">[Pg 6] There’s a spark of fire
left in the grate I declare—that’s lucky! I’ll light a candle if I can find one.
(feeling about) Here’s one—no, it’s a scent bottle—now I’ve got it—(takes
candle, and goes towards fireplace)—and now for a piece of paper. (takes a paper
out of his pocket, and about to tear it) Stop—it won’t do to tear this, this is
yesterday’s Times, in which I find that my friend Captain Ratcliffe has been appointed to
the situation of Chief Superintendent of the Rural Police, of the Western Division of the
County of Kent, and as I know he’s been here at Tunbridge Wells for the last week, I’ve
determined to find him out, and be the first to congratulate him—this’ll do! (taking
another piece of paper, and lighting the candle with it) There—and now—— (seeing a
letter on the table, and taking it up) What’s this? “Colonel Boldwig requests the
honour—Mrs. Somerton’s company—Thursday evening—quadrilles, &amp;c. &amp;c.” Then she’s
not at home; then, egad, I’ll wait for her here—but not in this costume—no, I’ll just
change my coat, et cetera: and, probably, my et cetera requires changing more than my
coat, because naturally in ascending a tree one occasionally requires to sit down,
consequently, it naturally follows that one’s et cetera, upon which one does sit down—of
course, it stands to reason—so here goes. (taking up the candle, carpet bag, and
umbrella, and going towards door, R.&nbsp;C., and enters. Scene
again dark. At this moment RATCLIFFE opens door at
R., enters, moves across on tiptoe, and locks the door at  span
class="stage">R.&nbsp;C.)

RAT. Come, I’ve got you safe under lock and key, my
worthy friend, whoever you are, and now not another moment must be lost. (advances
towards the writing desk quickly, L. table)

MRS. S. (without) Don’t be alarmed, David, I
forgot to say I had taken the latch key with me.

RAT. Mrs. Somerton’s voice, and no means of escape!
Then impudence befriend me! (hurries into room, R.)

Enter MRS. S span
class="smallerfont">OMERTON and PEGGY at
door, L.&nbsp;U.&nbsp;E.

PEGGY. (who carries a small lantern in her hand,
which she places on table) Dear, dear, how my poor old bones do ache.

MRS. S. (throws off her cloak and hood, and appears
in a handsome ball costume) Now go to bed at once, my good Peggy, I don’t require you
any more.

PEGGY. Yes you do, so sit down there—(making
MRS. SOMERTON sit
down on a chair)—and now, while I’m taking all these gimcracks and finery out of your
hair, you shall tell me all about the grand doings at the ball. I warrant me, what the
colonel’s footmen said of you was quite true.

MRS. S. And pray what did the colonel’s footmen
say?

PEGGY. They said—— Drat the pin! They said you were
the most beautiful lady in the room—that you had handsomer partners than any lady in the
room.

MRS. S. Yes—to do them, justice, they fairly danced me
off my feet, and yet I am neither grown better tempered, nor better looking, than I was
three months ago, when at a previous party a class="newpage"
id="page-7">[Pg 7] not one of them condescended to select me for a partner; but
then, on the other hand, I am fifteen thousand pounds richer.

PEGGY. (suddenly, and giving M span
class="smallerfont">RS. SOMERTON’ span
class="smallerfont">S hair another jerk) That’s it! Ah, ma’am, these lords
of the creation, as they call themselves, are but a poor mean selfish set after all.

MRS. S. Selfish! No, not all—(sighing)—there is
one at least.

PEGGY. No! Is there?—he must be quite a curiosity! Oh,
ma’am, who is he?

MRS. S. It’s a long story, Peggy, and it’s getting
late.

PEGGY. It’s never too late to hear good news.

MRS. S. Then listen, Peggy. You remember that about
ten months ago I was earnestly advised by my physicians to pay a short visit to the
continent.

PEGGY. Yes; and I remember too that you came home
quite an altered woman—I never saw hair dressed in such an extraordinary
style—never!

MRS. S. Don’t interrupt me. I had been in Paris about
three weeks, when one evening on my return from the opera, I found a note on my dressing
table, containing these words—“I have seen you, and to see you is to love you. I am young,
tolerably handsome, and sufficiently rich, yet as I cannot presume to present myself to
you until you permit me to do so, I shall venture to remind you from time to time that I
am near you.”

PEGGY. Well I’m sure, Mr. Impudence; and what was the
fellow’s name?

MRS. S. There was no name, but merely the initials C.
R.

PEGGY. C. R. Samuel something or other I dare say—but
he gave his address?

MRS. S. No; simply the words “Post Office, to be left
till called for.” Of course, I took no notice of it whatever, and had forgotten the
circumstance altogether, when a month afterwards to the very day—the very hour—I was then
at Florence, I received a second communication, couched in precisely the same words, and
again subsequently at Venice, Naples, and Milan.

PEGGY. Dear, dear, it’s as good as a play! Then you
never took any notice of the fellow at all?

MRS. S. Yes; a circumstance, the bare recollection of
which makes me shudder even at this lapse of time, compelled me to break through the
silence I had hitherto imposed upon myself: in travelling through Switzerland, on my
return to England, the carriage which I occupied was one night placed in imminent peril by
the restiveness of one of the horses; fortunately, I was asleep, and was not aware of my
danger till I was assured of my safety—within a few feet of a fearful precipice, the
traces had been cut, by a man who had evidently followed me, judge then of my astonishment
when a voice uttered these words in my ear, “You see, madam, I have kept my promise, I am
still near you.”

PEGGY. Well, he was a fine brave gentleman, whoever he
was; and what was he like—eh?

MRS. S. He had disappeared before I could even thank
him for his timely and generous assistance.

[Pg 8]

PEGGY. Well?

MRS. S. Well? (hesitatingly) his next letter,
which reached me shortly after my return to England, did not remain unanswered.

PEGGY. I should think not, indeed! and what did you
say to Mr. C. R.?

MRS. S. The truth! that my hand was promised to my
cousin, Percy Postlethwaite; that his father had once saved mine from ruin, who
made me promise, as the only means of testifying his gratitude to the father, to
marry the son.

PEGGY. Ah! and that, of course, was a settler for Mr.
C. R.

MRS. S. On the contrary, his answer to my letter ran
thus:—“Love like mine never despairs. I will still be near you, for I still hope”—and yet
for the last two months he has ceased to write.

PEGGY. Of course he has! and high time, too,
considering you told him you were Mrs. Postlethwaite, as was to be.

MRS. S. Very true; and yet (after a slight
hesitation) no matter, go to bed, Peggy. Good night.

PEGGY. Good night, ma’am. (taking the
lantern—aside) Luckily when Master Percy arrives he’ll put all this romantic
lackadaisical nonsense out of missus’s head.

Exit at door, L.&nbsp;C.

MRS. S. Yes, while the news of my recent accession to
fortune has brought so many admirers to my feet, he, on the contrary, has ceased to think
of me.

(MRS. S. seats herself in chair
near the work table, L.; R span
class="smallerfont">ATCLIFFE at the same moment enters and cautiously goes to
door, L.&nbsp;C., which he closes. The stage is only dimly
lighted)

MRS. S. (hearing the noise of the door closing, and
without turning round, as she unclasps her bracelets) Is that you again, Peggy?
(not receiving an answer, she turns and sees R span
class="smallerfont">ATCLIFFE; starts violently, and checking a scream) A
man!

RAT. (L.) Do not be
alarmed, madam, I beg. (advancing slowly)

MRS. S. (retreating, and in a tone of alarm which
she endeavours to repress) Who are you, sir? and why this unseasonable intrusion? I
insist on knowing.

RAT. A little patience, my dear madam, and you shall.
(observing MRS. S span
class="smallerfont">OMERTON, who endeavours to reach the door,  span
class="stage">L.&nbsp;C.) One moment, madam. Before you summon your servants,
allow me to observe that I shall be under the painful necessity of punishing any one who
presumes to interrupt so delightful a tete à tete. (slowly taking his pistols
from his pocket, and depositing them on the table)

MRS. S. (terrified and aside) He’s armed.
(suddenly) Ah! that writing desk—that large sum of money—(placing herself before
the table on which the writing desk is, and supporting herself with difficulty)

RAT. Now, madam, (crosses to  span
class="stage">R. with chair) the sooner I explain the object of this somewhat
unceremonious visit, the better. Will you allow me to lead you to a chair? (politely
offering his hand to MRS. S span
class="smallerfont">OMERTON, who draws back in alarm) Pray, my dear madam
let me once more entreat you not to be alarmed. (MRS.
SOMERTON a class="newpage"
id="page-9">[Pg 9] after a slight hesitation, gives him her hand, and he
leads her to the chair near table, at C.) Be seated, I beg.
(MRS. SOMERTON seats
herself. RATCLIFFE about to remove up for another
chair, MRS. S span
class="smallerfont">OMERTON advancing her hand towards the pistol—stops)
Pray be cautious with those pistols, madam; they are hair triggers, and I perceive the
muzzles are directly pointed towards you. (goes up to the back for a chair)

MRS. S. (aside and suddenly) If I could but
distinguish his features, so as to be able to recognise him. (hastily runs and brings
candle from the small table at L., and places it on table
before her)

RAT. (coming down with the chair,  span
class="stage">R.—stops) You’ll pardon me, madam, but having suffered lately
from a severe cold in my eyes, this excess of light would be positively distressing to me.
(removes the candle to the mantel-piece, L.; then about to
seat himself opposite to MRS. S span
class="smallerfont">OMERTON) Have I your permission, madam? I thank you! (seats
himself)

MRS. S. (aside) Was there ever such unblushing
effrontery?

RAT. Now, madam, I will come to the point at once. I
am in the immediate want of fifteen thousand pounds. (with marked
intention)

MRS. S. (aside) He knows all.

RAT. Which sum, madam, I intend to invest in a
speculation, which promises the most advantageous results.

MRS. S. (with affected unconcern) I cannot
understand, sir, how the subject you allude to can possibly interest me.

RAT. More than you imagine, my dear madam, for I
propose that you shall become my partner in this speculation; in other words, I will find
the industry and energy requisite in carrying it into effect, while you simply have to
provide the money. (with marked emphasis)

MRS. S. (indignantly) Sir!

RAT. That’s all! I’ll therefore make out a receipt for
the amount at once. (taking a piece of paper, and beginning to write)

MRS. S. (aside, and looking towards the back of the
stage) That bell communicates with David’s room; it is my only hope. (cautiously
rises from her chair, and goes on tiptoe towards the chimney-piece)

POS. (appearing at little window above door at
R.&nbsp;C.) I should very much like to know who has taken
the liberty of locking me in! I repeat, who has taken the liberty of locking me in? I
pause for a reply.

MRS. S. (looking at R span
class="smallerfont">ATCLIFFE, who pretends to be writing, but is watching her
movements—then making a sudden grasp at the bell rope) Ah! the bell rope cut!

RAT. (quietly looking up) Yes, true! I quite
forgot to mention that I had taken that little precaution against interruption.
(resumes his writing)

POS. (listening) Holloa! Either cousin Somerton
has got a very bad cold, or she’s not alone!

RAT. Here, madam, is the receipt. (rising)

POS. That’s a man’s voice!

RAT. And now, madam, the necessary forms being
completed[Pg 10] on my
part, all that remains is for you to find the funds; amounting, as I believe I mentioned
before, to the sum of fifteen thousand pounds.

MRS. S. (forcing a laugh) And do you imagine I
could be imprudent enough to keep so large a sum of money——?

RAT. On your person? Oh, dear no; that would be an
indiscretion for which, as your partner, I should certainly take the liberty of scolding
you.

POS. What’s that? he says he’s my wife’s partner! I
never even knew she was in business.

RAT. Until you could deposit it with your banker’s,
you have, doubtless, placed it somewhere under lock and key; but as you seem to have
forgotten the exact locality, I shall be most happy to assist you in your search. Suppose
we begin with the writing desk. (placing his hand on the desk) Will you oblige me
with the key?

POS. The fellow’s a housebreaker!

MRS. S. I—I have mislaid or lost it, sir: at least, I
think I have.

RAT. Pray think again, my dear madam, as it
would be really a pity to damage so elegant a piece of furniture.

POS. No—he’s a smasher! It’s lucky for him I can’t get
at him.

MRS. S. (suddenly, and with resolution) Sir,
although alone, and in the power of a desperate man like you, I will not be plundered
except by violence.

POS. That’s right, cousin—stick to that! She’s a
trump!

RAT. (approaching her as she leans against table in
C., and in a tone of reproach) Violence to a woman, and
such a woman! (bowing)

POS. Humbug!

RAT. I see you mistake me, madam, I came here to serve
you—to propose to you a safe and profitable investment for your money, but the moment you
object to that proposal—— (taking one of the pistols off the table and playing with
it)

POS. What’s that he’s got in his hand? (R span
class="smallerfont">ATCLIFFE cocks the pistol, the noise of which is distinctly
heard) It’s a blunderbuss! (disappears like lightning, then cautiously appears
again)

MRS. S. (shuddering and sinking into a chair)
You will find the key—in that vase—on the mantel-piece.

RAT. That vase, madam? (pointing with his pistol
towards mantel-piece in the direction of P span
class="smallerfont">OSTLETHWAITE, who again disappears like a shot; R span
class="smallerfont">ATCLIFFE goes to the mantel-piece, upon which he deposits
his pistols—then takes key out of the vase, and goes to the writing desk: during this
POSTLETHWAITE re-appears cautiously, sees the
pistols, and by leaning very much out of little window, tries to reach them—almost falling
out—disappears; re-appears with the tongs, and again tries to reach the pistols) Ah!
here is a drawer that requires some force to open, doubtless it contains the—— (opening
drawer) No, your diamonds. Ah, madam, I can trace the amiability of your disposition
even in your treatment of these poor jewels—you cease to wear them because their beauty
would be eclipsed by yours. (replacing diamonds in desk)

MRS. S. (aside, and smiling) To do the wretch
justice he has a certain mode of expressing himself——

[Pg 11]

POS. I hope he don’t mean to keep on fumbling that
writing desk about much longer, because the bottom of the cane chair has just given way.
Surely, Cousin Somerton never could have been such a simpleton as to lock all her money up
there.

RAT. Ah, at last—(taking the pocket book out of the
desk, and advancing to MRS. S span
class="smallerfont">OMERTON)—the pocket book.

POS. She’s a ruined woman and so am I! (dropping
his head against the side of the window)

MRS. S. (suddenly, and with an expression of
hope) Surely I heard a voice!

RAT. One of your servants probably. (going up
towards mantel-piece, and taking his pistols) I hope he will not take it into his head
to interrupt us, for I should certainly send a bullet through it. (P span
class="smallerfont">OSTLETHWAITE drops, and a noise of falling heard within
door, R.&nbsp;C.; R span
class="smallerfont">ATCLIFFE places the pistols on chimney piece) And now,
madam, (returning towards table at C.) with many
apologies for detaining you so long from your slumbers, I humbly take my leave. (seeing
the receipt, which he has left on the table) Stay! (taking up the receipt, which he
presents to MRS. S span
class="smallerfont">OMERTON) I promised you a receipt, madam, and here it is.

MRS. S. (derisively) A very valuable document
to me no doubt, sir.

RAT. A very necessary one, madam, in all commercial
transactions. (MRS. S span
class="smallerfont">OMERTON takes the receipt, and indignantly crumples it up in
her hand) Once more, madam, farewell. (taking his cloak and hat) And in taking
my leave, be assured that I carry away with me——

MRS. S. (sneeringly) I am perfectly aware, sir,
what you carry away with you.

RAT. The hope, madam, which I trust you in some degree
share with me, that our first interview will not be our last. (turns at door,  span
class="stage">L.&nbsp;C., makes a profound bow, and exits,  span
class="stage">L.&nbsp;U.&nbsp;E.)

MRS. S. He’s gone, and I have no longer strength even
to call for help.

POS. (knocking violently at door) But I have!
I’ll cry for help against any man in England! Help!

MRS. S. (rising) Ah, is that you, David?

POS. No—it’s me—Postlethwaite. Cousin Percy, open the
door. (MRS. SOMERTON
hastily runs and unlocks door, R.&nbsp;C., P span
class="smallerfont">OSTLETHWAITE puts his head out) Is the ruffian gone?

MRS. S. Yes—yes.

POS. You’re sure of it?

MRS. S. (L.) Quite
sure.

POS. (R., rushing
on) Then let me get at him! Come out wherever you are, and face me like a man—come on,
I say. (squaring violently) Coward! (in a tone of supreme contempt)

MRS. S. Then you have heard——

POS. Everything from that window, above that closet
there, or whatever it is where I’ve been locked up for the last hour among the
pickles.

MRS. S. And yet you allowed me to be robbed.

POS. Come I like that—you allowed yourself to be
robbed.

[Pg 12]

MRS. S. (contemptuously) And you did
nothing.

POS. I beg your pardon, I looked on in silent
astonishment.

MRS. S. But you ought to have made a noise.

POS. So I did—I tumbled down backwards into a lot of
grocery.

(from the beginning of this Scene between M span
class="smallerfont">RS. SOMERTON and P span
class="smallerfont">OSTLETHWAITE it has gradually become daylight)

MRS. S. And to think that he should be allowed to
effect his escape! What shall I do?

POS. Do? Take example by me, show a proper spirit like
me, and send for the police.

MRS. S. We have none.

POS. No police! (suddenly recollecting) but
I have, of course, and a superintendent into the bargain—here—in my pocket.

MRS. S. You’ve got a superintendent of police in your
pocket?

POS. Yes—no; but I’ve got his appointment—that’s the
same thing, besides he’s a friend of mine; I’ll run for him this moment, and in less than
ten minutes we’ll have him here dead or alive; I mean my friend—no—the robber—no, my
friend. (running to door, L.&nbsp;C.) Holloa, this
door’s locked (running to mantel-piece and about to ring the bell) and the bell
rope’s cut (suddenly) ah! the ruffian has left his pistols behind him. (seizing
pistols off the mantel-piece) Stand out of the way, cousin. (rushing to
window)

MRS. S. What are you about to do?

POS. Do? send a bullet through his body.

MRS. S. Pshaw! Why you can’t even see him.

POS. Then I’m the more likely to hit him; besides, it
will raise an alarm at all events. (pulling both triggers as he points the pistols out
at window) Holloa they’re not loaded! (suddenly) Oh, if I had only known that.
(about to get out at the window)

MRS. S. Cousin, what are you about?

POS. Why, as I can’t get out by the door, I must have
recourse to the window. (getting out)

MRS. S. And this for me! Oh, how kind of you, Cousin;
but pray mind how you get down!

POS. Don’t be alarmed; it’s a precious deal easier
than getting up! besides I know every inch of the road; so good bye, cousin, and in my way
to my friend the superintendent, I’ll knock up all the neighbours and tell them to scour
the country; we’ll find your fifteen thousand pounds again for you. (gets quite out and
gradually disappears) So don’t give way—keep up as I do. Oh, lud. (suddenly
disappears altogether—loud noise of broken glass heard)

MRS. S. He’s fallen! (calling out of window)
Cousin! cousin!

POS. (from without) It’s all right. I’ve only
tumbled into a cucumber frame or something of the sort. I can have the bits of glass taken
out of me when I get back.

MRS. S. (looking out) There he runs, but he’s
without his hat! (calling aloud) Cousin! cousin! you’ve dropped your hat! he
doesn’t hear me.

PEGGY. (without at door,  span
class="stage">L.&nbsp;C.) Missus—missus, the door’s locked. (unlocks door
and runs in followed by DAVID, both have their
night-caps[Pg 13]
on, and DAVID carries an old fashioned
blunderbuss) Oh, ma’am, what’s all this noise about—what does it all mean?

DAVID. Ees, what do it all mean?

MRS. S. It means, my poor Peggy, that I have been
robbed.

PEGGY. Robbed, but not murdered, I hope.

MRS. S. (smiling) No, not quite, though I am
almost dead with alarm! David, have you seen no one?

DAVID. No, ma’am—no one but your cousin, master Percy,
who arrived about half an hour before you came home.

MRS. S. Yes, yes, I know; but there was another.

DAVID. Then I didn’t let him in, and I know he
can’t have gone out again without my seeing him. (aside) To be sure I’ve been fast
asleep all the time.

MRS. S. Then perhaps he’s still in the house?

PEGGY. Lud a mercy! (getting behind D span
class="smallerfont">AVID, who in his turn tries to get behind P span
class="smallerfont">EGGY)

DAVID. (suddenly as he looks towards window,  span
class="stage">R. in flat) Look, ma’am, if there ben’t Sergeant Jones of the
rural police riding along the lane at the bottom of the garden. (running to window and
shouting) Here, Sergeant Jones, stop—he hears me, ma’am.

MRS. S. This is fortunate indeed; so run, David, and
give him information of the robbery; tell him that he may rely on the most liberal reward.
(DAVID about to run off) and, David, tell him
also, should he discover any clue, that he must communicate with his superintendent
here—that I expect him every moment; run, David. (D span
class="smallerfont">AVID runs off at L.&nbsp;C.)
and you, Peggy, go down stairs and be ready to open the door; I will go to my room for a
few minutes.

PEGGY. Do, ma’am; it’ll do you good to lie down a bit;
it’s broad day-light—just till Mr. Superintendent comes. (M span
class="smallerfont">RS. SOMERTON enters her
room, L.)

PEGGY. (looking after her) Poor missus—she’s
lost all her treasures except me.

Exit at door, L.&nbsp;C.

POS. (without) I tell you it’s all right, so
come along.

RAT. (without) But, my dear fellow—

POSTLETHWAITE enters at  span
class="stage">L.&nbsp;C. pulling in RATCLIFFE,
without his beard, moustache, and over coat, and in a modern walking suit.

I never applied for the appointment; there’s some mistake.

POS. Mistake, nonsense! here it is in the newspaper,
and you know as well as I do that newspapers never make mistakes. Captain Charles
Ratcliffe appointed superintendent of the rural police.

RAT. (aside) What the devil’s to be
done?—luckily I’ve got rid of my disguise!

POS. How very odd I should happen to run up against
you. Eh! at five o’clock in the morning too.

RAT. Yes, I was going home from a bachelor’s party.
(confused)

POS. Little dreaming that at that moment you held the
distinguished position of commander-in-chief of the rural police force of this important
district.

RAT. Pshaw! I shall resign at once. (going)

[Pg 14]

POS. (pulling him back) You can’t till your
successor is appointed.

RAT. (aside) There’s no escape, I must brazen
it out: lucky I have got rid of my disguise, at any rate I shall see her once more!
(aloud, and in an assumed tone of authority) ahem! (seats himself) now I am
ready to listen to you.

POS. (L.) That’s right—you
must know then. (seats himself)

RAT. (R.) One moment, are
you about to address me in my official capacity?

POS. Of course, I am.

RAT. Then don’t sit down.

POS. But really my back aches to that degree—

RAT. Then I’ll receive your deposition to-morrow.
(gets up and going)

POS. No, no! (pushing R span
class="smallerfont">ATCLIFFE in his chair again) I’ll stand up there! and
now, my dear fellow—

RAT. A little less familiarity, if you please, young
man.

POS. Very well—you must know then, old chap—

RAT. Again—

POS. Well, then, your worship! there, will that do?
you must know then, your worship, that I’ve just been robbed of a very considerable sum of
money.

RAT. You?

POS. Well, my cousin, Mrs. Somerton has—and as I’m
going to marry her, what’s her’s is mine, and what’s mine’s my own; but you know all about
that, governor—I mean your worship.

RAT. Which property I suppose, you wish to
recover?

POS. Of course, I do; you’ll excuse me, my dear boy,
Charley, I mean your worship, but that’s a remarkable stupid observation of your’s.

RAT. Silence—was the robbery you speak of accompanied
by violence?

POS. Of course, it was! would you allow a fellow to
walk off with your property without making a fight of it, not you, my trojan—I mean your
worship! but I’ll tell you all about it. I had just arrived from London, and finding that
cousin Somerton had that instant returned home from a ball, I determined to give her an
agreeable surprise, and for that purpose I was walking on tiptoe along that passage, when
I was almost knocked off my legs by a piercing shriek. “My cousin in danger,” said I,
“then Postlethwaite to the rescue,” said I, and with an unfaltering grasp I seized the
handle of the door—it was locked, upon which with one blow of this fist—you know my
muscular power—I knocked the door clean off its hinges.

RAT. (smiling) You don’t say so?

POS. Well, in I rushed, and the first thing I saw
was——

RAT. What?

POS. Nothing; the room was in total darkness, and the
next instant I found myself face to face with a gigantic housebreaker about seven foot
high, with two pair of pistols in each hand, and there, extended upon the hearth rug, with
her head on the fender lay my poor cousin in a dead faint, and as pale as a sheet.

[Pg 15]

RAT. (smiling) But how the deuce did you manage
to see all this when the room was in total darkness?

POS. What of that? everybody knows that housebreakers
are always as pale as a sheet when they faint away; I mean women are always seven feet
high—no, housebreakers—really you interrupt me so I don’t know what I’m talking about.

RAT. (smiling) Well?

POS. Well, though I was unarmed, I instantly rushed
upon the two ruffians.

RAT. Two ruffians?

POS. Yes. I said there were two, who instantly made
for the door, which luckily I had taken the precaution of locking.

RAT. Locking! What the door you had just knocked clean
off its hinges?

POS. Yes. I forgot to mention that in the meantime I
had picked the door up and hung it on again. Well, finding they couldn’t escape, they both
sprang upon me at the same time! The fearful struggle then began afresh, till exhausted
nature could do no more, and the whole three of us rolled out of the window together. But
here comes my cousin! (running to door, L.)

RAT. Then, as I said before, impudence befriend
me.

POS. (handing in M span
class="smallerfont">RS. SOMERTON) Come along,
cousin, I told you I’d soon have my friend the superintendent here. Captain Ratcliffe, my
cousin. My cousin, Captain Ratcliffe. (introducing them. M span
class="smallerfont">RS. SOMERTON curtseys to
RATCLIFFE, and on looking at him gives a very
slight start, while RATCLIFFE continues to show
the utmost sang froid) And now, cousin, the sooner you give him all the particulars.
Why, what’s the matter with you? (observing how M span
class="smallerfont">RS. SOMERTON is
examining RATCLIFFE)

MRS. S. Nothing. Doubtless I am mistaken. Yet, I am
under the impression that this is not the first time——

RAT. That we have met? madam, if so, I am ashamed to
say that I have forgotten the circumstance. (crosses to  span
class="stage">C.)

MRS. S. (aside) The voice
too—pshaw—impossible!

RAT. Now, madam, as every moment is of the utmost
importance you must be good enough to answer a few questions. In the first place how the
entrance to the house was effected by the robbers. (taking out his pocket book and
pencil.)

MRS. S. Robbers!—there was only one.

RAT. Only one! (to P span
class="smallerfont">OSTLETHWAITE) I understood you to say there were—

POS. (interrupting him) Yes, yes. (aside to
him) Of course, she doesn’t know how many there were, because as soon as she saw
one she fainted.

RAT. True! (smiling)

MRS. S. (aside) That voice again—I must be
mistaken—yet, every word he utters—(looking again fixedly at R span
class="smallerfont">ATCLIFFE)

RAT. (C., to M span
class="smallerfont">RS. S.) You have not answered my question, madam.

MRS. S. I can only say, sir, that on being left alone,
I was disturbed by a slight noise, and on turning round, he stood before me—as you do.

[Pg 16]

RAT. A bold and impudent villain, evidently. I can
easily conceive your alarm, madam, but luckily your cousin here on hearing your piercing
shrieks, (POSTLETHWAITE pulls his coat tail)
rushes to your assistance, and with one blow of his masculine fist—

POS. (stopping him, and aside) That’ll do—don’t
remind her of that terrific scene, it distresses her.

RAT. (smiling again) True. (to M span
class="smallerfont">RS. S.) Then, madam, you would probably be able to identify
this audacious criminal?

MRS. S. (with intention) Not with absolute
certainty, sir.

POS. No, more should I.

RAT. That’s strange too, considering the length of
time you were struggling with him.

POS. Yes, yes. (aside to him) That’ll do—she
can’t bear it.

MRS. S. (still with intention) And were I to
act upon my present suspicions, however well grounded they may appear, I might be
the means of compromising—

RAT. Who, madam?

MRS. S. (looking at him) One perhaps, whose
position in society——

RAT. Nay, madam—as the representative of the law, I
tell you that it matters not what his social position may be, we must not mince
matters.

POS. Certainly not. I’d rather mince him. Fifteen
thousand pounds is a lump of money.

RAT. (with pretended astonishment) Fifteen
thousand pounds—the unconscionable scoundrel!—one moment (writing in the pocket
book)—amount stolen—fifteen thousand pounds; number of robbers——

POS. (aside to him) Uncertain! as there seems
to be a little difference of opinion between cousin and me upon that point. You’d better
say “uncertain.”

RAT. (to MRS.
S.) Bank notes, I presume?

MRS. S. Yes, sir—bank notes.

RAT. And contained in that writing desk.

MRS. S. (aside) ’Tis he, I’m sure of it
(hastily and aside to POSTLETHWAITE, while
RATCLIFFE is examining the writing desk)—tell
me, do you say you know him?

POS. Who, the housebreaker?

MRS. S. No, that person. (pointing to R span
class="smallerfont">ATCLIFFE)

POS. Know my friend Ratcliffe, of course I do.

RAT. (observing them and coming down, between
them.) I regret I cannot hold out to you any reasonable hope of recovering your
property.

POS. You don’t mean that?

RAT. Why, unfortunately Mrs. Somerton is unable to
give me the slightest clue.

MRS. S. But I do possess a clue—a certain infallible
one.

POS. Ah!—then where is your clue—produce your
clue—what is your clue?

MRS. S. (looking intently at R span
class="smallerfont">ATCLIFFE) A paper in the handwriting of this bold and impudent
villain, (RATCLIFFE slightly  span
class="pagenum">[Pg 17]starts) treating
the matter as a commercial transaction, and affecting to acknowledge as a voluntary loan
from me the amount of which he plundered me.

RAT. (quickly) A most important document
indeed, and of the utmost consequence that I should obtain immediate possession of it.

MRS. S. (sarcastically) I believe you, sir;
shall I fetch it?

RAT. Certainly.

MRS. S. And you will remain here till I return?
(significantly)

RAT. Assuredly.

MRS. S. (hastily—aside to P span
class="smallerfont">OSTLETHWAITE) See that he does.

Exit hastily, L.&nbsp;D.

RAT. (aside and agitated) That cursed paper may
betray me, and this mad desperate game will have been played in vain.

POS. (taking his arm and in a confidential
manner) Now between you and me and the post, if Cousin Somerton was to say to you,
what will you give me for the chance of recovering my fifteen thousand pounds? what would
you feel disposed to offer?

RAT. Not fifteen thousand farthings.

POS. (aside) The devil.

RAT. But what of that; the loss of a few paltry
thousand can never lessen the intense affection you feel for your charming cousin.

POS. What do you mean by “intense affection?” I
respect her—I like her—so I did my grandmother, but it never would occur to me to fall
down and worship the ground she treads upon! besides to be candid with you, I don’t think
she is the sort of woman to fret herself into fiddlestrings about me.

RAT. Indeed!

POS. No; besides, I put it to you, would it not be
most selfish, most unkind in me to take a mean advantage of her promise to marry me, and
compel my young and lovely relative to spend the remainder of her existence with me in my
second floor in Arabella Row, Pimlico.

RAT. (grasping P span
class="smallerfont">OSTLETHWAITE’S hand)
That sentiment does you honour! Then she’s at liberty to cancel her engagement to you?
(eagerly)

POS. Yes, from this moment she’s at liberty.

Enter PEGGY running,  span
class="stage">L.&nbsp;U.&nbsp;E.

PEGGY. Where is he? (comes down  span
class="stage">C.) Where’s Mr. Superintendent? (to R span
class="smallerfont">ATCLIFFE) Oh, sir, (seeing P span
class="smallerfont">OSTLETHWAITE) Lor, Master Percy, is that you? (throwing her
arms round POSTLETHWAITE, then turning again to
RATCLIFFE) Oh, sir, I’ve got such news. (to
POSTLETHWAITE) Lor bless’ee, I must have another
buss. (flinging her arms round POSTLETHWAITE)

POS. That’ll do, Peggy; I appreciate your affection,
but it rumples one’s front. (arranging his shirt)

PEGGY. (to R span
class="smallerfont">ATCLIFFE) Then, sir—well, and so you must know that.
(turning to POSTLETHWAITE again) Lor
love’ee. (about to embrace him again. P span
class="smallerfont">OSTLETHWAITE turns away)

PEGGY. (to R span
class="smallerfont">ATCLIFFE) Well, sir, Sergeant Jones has just been span
class="pagenum">[Pg 18] here, and says he to
me—says he—tell my Superintendent, Captain Ratcliffe, says he, that we’ve found the
robber, says he.

POS. (triumphantly) And the money too, of
course; not that my intense affection for my charming cousin could ever be influenced by a
few paltry thousands more or less—no; I love her for herself alone.

PEGGY. It does my old heart good to hear you say that,
because they’ve neither found the robber nor the money yet.

POS. Pooh, what a stupid old fool you are. What have
they found then?

PEGGY. A hat!

POS. A hat! I never heard of anything so absurd in all
my life.

PEGGY. But it’s a very peculiar hat—what they call a
wide-awake—a green one. (POSTLETHWAITE here slowly
raises his hand and feels his head, then looks about him. R span
class="smallerfont">ATCLIFFE notices his movements)

PEGGY. Sergeant Jones found it under the window; but
that’s not all—he says that the robber in making his escape must have fallen into the
green house, and that probably his clothes may have been cut, or that pieces of glass may
be sticking in him. (POS. falls behind—gives a sudden
start of pain—then examines his coat tails and finds one of them torn, fixes his hand on
it. RATCLIFFE still observing him) But that’s
not all, there are footmarks on the gravel walk, and as the gravel was only laid down
yesterday, Sergeant Jones says that some of it must be sticking to his boots. (here
POSTLETHWAITE begins shuffling with his feet
about, which he keeps up incessantly) But that’s not all! as Joe Podger, the
blacksmith was going to his work this morning, he saw a man, a little short man, he says,
(POSTLETHWAITE draws himself up and crosses to  span
class="stage">C.) drop from that window, and he says he should know him again
among a thousand.

POS. Oh lud! (slightly staggering)

RAT. (trying to check a laugh) What’s the
matter, my dear fellow? here sit down. (making P span
class="smallerfont">OS. sit down, who utters a cry of pain and jumps up again,
then seeing RAT. and P span
class="smallerfont">EG. looking at him, begins shuffling his feet about again,
and keeping his hand on his coat tail)

RAT. (to PEG.)
Tell Sergeant Jones from me to act upon the information he has got without one moment’s
loss of time; run, fly! (PEGGY trots out at door,
L.&nbsp;U.&nbsp;E.)

RAT. (to P span
class="smallerfont">OS. and slapping him on the shoulder) This is famous
news indeed, eh?

POS. Yes, glorious news, though for my part I can’t
see that there’s anything at all in finding a wide-a-wake—any man might lose his
wide-a-wake—I might lose mine, and it might be a green wide-a-wake.

RAT. Heaven forbid, for I should immediately arrest
you, my dear friend, but what of that? your charming cousin is too well aware of your
intense affection.

POS. What d’ye mean by intense affection? As I
said before, I respect her—I like her, but—

RAT. But what?

POS. (grasping R span
class="smallerfont">ATCLIFFE’S hand and
assuming a desperate tone and manner) The dreadful truth must be spoken! I’m a
rascal—I[Pg 19] love
another—the interesting widow of a large straw bonnet maker. When I say large, I don’t
allude to the bonnet maker, but the business—and shall I basely forsake the confiding
woman who has placed all her straw bonnets—I mean all her happiness in my hands?—No!
though my cousin will soon have her £15,000 again.

RAT. That’s very doubtful.

POS. No such thing. I’m certain of it, and so are you;
still, never, never shall it be said of Postlethwaite, that he was actuated by the love of
filthy lucre—so you’ll wish her good bye for me, won’t you?

RAT. Stay. Suppose you write a few lines to her,
stating your reasons for renouncing her hand, and I’ll deliver the letter to her.

POS. I’ll do it at once, (aside) and
considering that there’s very little chance of Cousin Somerton’s seeing a shilling of her
money again, and a very considerable chance of my getting into trouble; the sooner I make
my way back to Arabella Row, Pimlico, the better. (goes into room,  span
class="stage">R.&nbsp;2&nbsp; span
class="stage">E.)

RAT. (anxiously) Will he write to her?
will he, indeed, renounce her hand?

Enter MRS. S span
class="smallerfont">OMERTON, L.

MRS. S. (aside) Still here, ’tis well; and now,
Captain Ratcliffe, it is my turn to frighten you.

RAT. (resuming his official manner) Well,
madam, have you found this important paper?

MRS. S. Yes, sir, but conceive my annoyance, when
instead of a receipt, as I anticipated, I found the paper consisted of a few wretched
insipid verses; intended to be very complimentary, no doubt, but commonplace in the
extreme.

RAT. (aside) This is pleasant. I thought they
were remarkably pretty verses. (aloud) Might I be favoured with a perusal of
them?

MRS. S. Unfortunately, a near neighbour of mine, a
magistrate happened to look in, and thinking it would forward the ends of justice,
I placed the paper in his hands.

RAT. A magistrate?

MRS. S. Yes, who on looking at it, suddenly exclaimed,
“I cannot be mistaken—no, I’ll swear to the handwriting.”

RAT. Indeed! (aside) The devil! (aloud)
and his name is——

MRS. S. Boldwig.

RAT. Boldwig! (aside) My old colonel, damn it,
I’ve written a hundred letters to him.

MRS. S. The colonel fancies the robber may be still
concealed on the premises.

RAT. (forcing a laugh) Ha, ha! Still on the
premises, a very likely matter.

MRS. S. Why not? So bold and impudent a villain, as
you very properly designate him. How fortunate it was that I remembered the existence of
that “important paper.”

RAT. Yes, it was a very brilliant idea of yours,
indeed.

MRS. S. And how still more fortunate that Colonel
Boldwig at[Pg 20] once
recognised the handwriting, for of course it will infallibly lead to the capture of the
unconscionable scoundrel, as you very properly called him.

RAT. (rather nettled) You seem remarkably
anxious to punish this unhappy misguided being, ma’am.

MRS. S. Heyday! did you not say to me, just now,
“Madam, as the representative of the law, I tell you that it matters not what his social
position may be; we must not mince matters.” (imitating R span
class="smallerfont">ATCLIFFE’S manner.)

RAT. (aside) She’s laughing at me, that’s quite
clear. (aloud) Of course not; but—but—(drawing his chair closer to M span
class="smallerfont">RS. S span
class="smallerfont">OMERTON)—but—(aside) Pon my life it requires more
courage than I imagined. (aloud) I was about to observe that the circumstances
attending this robbery are so—so whimsical.

MRS. S. Whimsical?

RAT. No, not whimsical, eccentric! that one is almost
inclined to ascribe it to some other motive.

MRS. S. (aside) We are coming to it by degrees;
(aloud) and pray, sir, what other motive can your lively imagination suggest?

RAT. (drawing still nearer, and after a short
hesitation, then in a low and impassioned tone) Love!

MRS. S. (aside and smiling) At last.
(aloud) Love! ha, ha, ha! Love of bank notes!

RAT. (earnestly) No. Love for you. Yes, madam,
cannot you imagine an admiration so boundless—a passion so irresistible, that it might
prompt a man?

MRS. S. To rob me of £15,000, and frighten me out of
senses into the bargain.

RAT. (still more earnestly) Yes, madam, if by
so doing, if by apparently reducing the woman to poverty, he hoped to obtain a voluntary
resignation of her hand from a rival, who loves her for her fortune only.

MRS. S. Really, Captain Ratcliffe, I must confess you
have imagined a marvellous pleasant love story.

RAT. Not more marvellous than true. Here are the
proofs, (gives pocket book to MRS. S span
class="smallerfont">OMERTON) and now think, madam, what a love must that man’s be
who could thus risk his name, character, and reputation, with the sole hope of preserving
you your liberty.

MRS. S. But unfortunately the denouement of this
romance of real life is wanting; the rival does not resign the lady’s hand.

RAT. (aside, and looking towards room,  span
class="stage">R.&nbsp;2&nbsp; span
class="stage">E.) Why the devil doesn’t he make haste with the letters? (P span
class="smallerfont">OSTLETHWAITE looks in at the door)

MRS. S. (catching a glimpse of him) No, sir, I
know my cousin too well—he loves me too dearly to care about my loss of fortune; he
will be only too happy to work for me, toil for me, slave for me.

POS. (at door) Will he! (disappears)

MRS. S. He will never resign the hand of her he loves,
beggared though she be. (here POSTLETHWAITE
comes out of room cautiously, slips the letter into R span
class="smallerfont">ATCLIFFE’S hand, and runs
out at door, L.&nbsp;C.)

RAT. (presenting letter to M span
class="smallerfont">RS. SOMERTON) From Mr.
Percy[Pg 21]
Postlethwaite, madam. (aside) If he has deceived me I’ll make Arabella Row,
Pimlico, the scene of a terrific drama.

MRS. S. (reading letter) “Ever beloved cousin,
I need not say that the loss of your fortune is nothing to me——” (to R span
class="smallerfont">ATCLIFFE) You hear?

RAT. (aside) The devil take him!

MRS. S. (reading) “——But as the presence of a
handsome, dashing young man like Captain Ratcliffe, under your roof in the middle of the
night will necessarily afford materials for all the scandal mongers in the neighbourhood,
I reluctantly tear your image from my heart, and bid you farewell for ever."

RAT. Then you are free—free to bestow your heart, your
hand!

MRS. S. Nay, sir, what if my heart were no longer at
my disposal? (RATCLIFFE starts) What if it had
long since been given to one who once preserved my life at the peril of his own, and whose
letters faithfully preserved (slowly and with emotion drawing forth a packet of letters
from her bosom, and looking down) enabled me to recognise his handwriting.

RAT. Can it be possible? (with rapture)

MRS. S. That I have been taking my revenge on you for
the last half hour without your perceiving it! (holding out her hand)

RAT. Oh, madam! (kissing her hand)

MRS. S. Hark! (noise without)

DAVID. (without) Bring him along—if he won’t
come agreeable, drag him in by the hair of his head.

Enter DAVID, running,
L.&nbsp;C., and dragging in P span
class="smallerfont">OSTLETHWAITE, his dress disordered, D span
class="smallerfont">AVID carries a green wide-awake in his hand—P span
class="smallerfont">EGGY following.

DAV. Here, missus, we’ve got the robber.

MRS. S. (holding R span
class="smallerfont">ATCLIFFE’S hand) So
have I!

DAVID. Here be the desperate villain, ma’am, and here
be his desperate green wide-awake; (shewing hat) and what’s more, we won’t let him
go.

MRS. S. No more will I! (seeing P span
class="smallerfont">OSTLE.) Cousin Postlethwaite!

PEGGY. (running forward) Lawks! yes—so it be.
Oh, Master Percy! (throwing her arms round P span
class="smallerfont">OSTLETHWAITE)

POS. (throwing her off) Don’t be a fool, Peggy.
As I said before, it rumples one’s front.

MRS. S. (making a sign, all come forward and
surround her) My good friends, you need give yourselves no further trouble, I have
recovered my property. My fifteen thousand pounds are here.

(shows pocket book)

POS. You don’t mean that! (very tenderly) Oh,
my ever beloved cousin! (aside to RATCLIFFE)
Where’s my letter? (again to MRS. S span
class="smallerfont">OMERTON, and still more tenderly) I repeat—oh, my ever
beloved cousin! (again aside to RATCLIFFE) Where’s
my letter?

RAT. (aside to him) I gave it to Mrs.
Somerton—it’s all right.

POS. All right! I’m horribly afraid it’s all
wrong!

MRS. S. Yes, cousin, I’ve read your cruel words, and
as it seems you won’t have me—— (with affected grief)

[Pg 22]

POS. But I will. (very tenderly) Dry your tears
ever-beloved one—I will have you.

MRS. S. What, in spite of the presence of a fine
dashing young man under my roof in the middle of the night—eh, cousin?

POS. (still very tenderly) What of that? I’m
not so very particular.

MRS. S. But think of the scandal mongers of the
neighbourhood—eh, cousin?

POS. Never mind—I’m desperate!

MRS. S. So am I—and, therefore, as the only means of
preserving my reputation, I gave my hand to him who has compromised it.

(giving her hand to R span
class="smallerfont">ATCLIFFE.)

POS. What, Charley Ratcliffe?

PEGGY. (aside) Then that’s Mr. C. R. after
all.

RAT. (to P span
class="smallerfont">OSTLETHWAITE) Yes, my dear friend, the gigantic housebreaker,
seven feet high, with two pair of pistols in each of his brawny hands, stands before
you.

POS. You? Poo—poo! Where are your whiskers?—where’s
your imperial?

RAT. In my pocket—ha, ha!

POS. (after a short pause) I say, Master
Charley, what sort of a game have you been playing here?

MRS. S. (smiling) A game of fright.

POS. Ecod, it’s more like “Beat my neighbour out of
doors!”

RAT. At any rate, I have secured this lady for my
partner, and for such a prize who would not play “A D span
class="smallerfont">ESPERATE GAME.”

CURTAIN.

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
