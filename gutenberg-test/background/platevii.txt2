PLATE VII.

DIAGRAM OF THE CIRCULATION OF THE BLOOD.




PLATE VII:
Diagram illustrating the circulation of the blood. The
arrows indicate the direction in which the blood flows. The valves of the heart,
situated between the right auricle and ventricle, and left auricle and ventricle,
and between the ventricles and large arteries, are represented by curved lines.
These valves are intended to prevent the flow of blood in a direction contrary
to that indicated by the arrows.
