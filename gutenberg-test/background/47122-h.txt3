      PREFACE.
    
    
      Up to Queen Anne,
      this work is based upon Agnes Strickland's "Queens of England;" but
      subsequent to that period many authorities have been consulted, and only
      such matter used as would seem appropriate. My first care was to prepare a
      narrative which should interest young people, but I have endeavored also
      to produce a result that would prove a source, not only of pleasure, but
      of profit. The limits of the design make it evident that some eminent
      names and noteworthy events could receive slight mention, or none at all,
      and that politics could be introduced only when requisite for the
      comprehension of events that depended on them. It will be a satisfaction
      to hope that my readers may be prompted to independent inquiry.

      CHAPTER I. MARY, FIRST QUEEN-REGNANT OF ENGLAND AND IRELAND.
    
    
      (A.D. 1516-1558).
    
    
      Mary was the only
      child of Henry VIII. and Katherine of Arragon who lived to maturity. She
      was born at Greenwich Palace in 1516, and was placed under the care of her
      mother's beloved friend, Margaret Plantagenet, Countess of Salisbury.
    
    
      A.D. 1516. She was baptized the third day after
      her birth, and named for the king's favorite sister.
    
    
      Mary's mother began her education as soon as she could speak, and when she
      was only three years old she sat up in state to receive some foreign
      visitors, and amused them by playing on the virginals, a musical
      instrument similar to a piano. It was in a box about four feet long, with
      an ivory key-board of two or three octaves, and was placed on a table when
      played upon.
    
    
      At that time Mary was a bright, merry child, with rosy complexion and
      brown eyes, and such a pet with her parents that she remained with them at
      Greenwich until after her fourth birthday.
    
    
      A.D. 1522. While Mary was yet in her cradle a
      marriage was spoken of for her with Francis I., but her mother  span
      class="pagenum">[016]was anxious
      to see her united to her own nephew, the Emperor Charles V., who paid a
      visit to the English court when he was about twenty-three years old. He
      was there nearly five weeks, during which the little princess became very
      fond of him, and, young as she was, learned to consider herself his
      empress.
    
    
      He signed a solemn treaty at Windsor to marry her when she was twelve
      years old, but was desirous that she should be sent to Spain for her
      education. Her parents would not consent to the separation, but engaged
      the best instructors for her, and had a plan of study drawn up by a
      Spaniard of deep learning. His rules were rigid; he required the young
      princess to read religious works night and morning, to translate English
      into Latin frequently, and to converse in that language with her teacher.
      He implored her never to read books of chivalry or romance, condemned a
      long list of light works as injurious to morals, and recommended instead
      Plato, Cicero, Seneca's Maxims, Plutarch, the works of Erasmus, Sir Thomas
      More's "Utopia," some of the classic poets, and the tragedies of Seneca.
      He deemed card-playing and fine dressing as injurious as romances, and
      gave rules for the pronunciation of Greek and Latin, requiring that
      lessons in those languages should be committed to memory every day, and
      read over two or three times before the pupil went to bed.
    
    
      No wonder the poor child's health and spirits suffered, for she was only
      six years old when this system of education was enforced.
    
    
      The Emperor Charles still continued to desire her to spend part of her
      time in Spain, but Henry VIII. promised instead that she should be brought
      up in England like a Spanish lady, and should even wear the national dress
      of that country. He added, that nobody in all Christendom  span
      class="pagenum">[017]could be
      found to bring her up according to the customs of Spain better than her
      mother, who came of a noble house of that country, and, besides, that the
      princess was too young to undertake the voyage.
    
    
      A.D. 1525. During the summer of 1525 a rumor
      reached England that Charles V. had engaged himself to Isabel of Portugal.
      This was little Mary's first sorrow, for her maids had persuaded her that
      she was really in love. But Charles had heard of the king's intention to
      divorce his wife and disinherit his daughter, and was excessively angry;
      in consequence, he thought best to revenge himself on Mary. He wrote a
      letter filled with reproaches to Henry, and married Isabel before the end
      of the year.
    
    
      Then Mary, though only nine years of age, was established in a court of
      her own at Ludlow Castle, in Wales. She had not been called Princess of
      Wales, but received the same honors as though she had.
    
    
      The Welsh were pleased to have the royal family represented in their
      country, and the officers and nobles of Mary's court superintended the
      newly-formed legislature.
    
    
      Sir John Dudley, afterwards Earl of Warwick, was her chamberlain, and the
      Countess of Salisbury resided with her, as she had done from her birth, as
      head of her establishment. There were, besides, thirteen ladies of honor,
      and a large number of other officers.
    
    
      Few children are so lovely, bright, and well-behaved as Mary was at that
      time, when she had her first lessons in playing the part of queen, which
      she was so soon to unlearn. Probably Henry placed her in the position of
      heir-apparent of England, hoping that she would make a grand match before
      he disinherited her, otherwise there could be no reason for it,
      considering the poverty and contempt she suffered later.  span
      class="pagenum">[018]Her
      education went on steadily during the eighteen months she spent at Ludlow,
      and great care was taken of her exercise, diet, dress, and everything
      pertaining to her health and morals.
    
    
      Her father made a desperate attempt to marry her to Francis I., but he was
      engaged to the widow of the King of Portugal, besides he was by no means
      anxious to marry a girl eleven years of age.
    
    
      Spite of the methodical course of Mary's education she took part in the
      revelry at her father's court when she was not more than eleven years old,
      and danced a ballet with seven other ladies and eight lords. She also
      performed in one of Terence's comedies in the original Latin for the
      entertainment of the French ambassadors when they were at Hampton Court.
    
    
      A.D. 1529. Her misfortunes dated from that
      period, for it was then that her mother's divorce began to be publicly
      discussed.
    
    
      Katherine was anxious to marry her daughter to Reginald Pole, son of the
      Countess of Salisbury, but he had no desire to connect himself with the
      English court, though he was always fond of Mary, and gave as excuse that
      he had been educated for the church, though he never became either a
      priest or a monk. He did not hesitate to express to the king his entire
      disapproval of the pending divorce, and thus incurred the royal
      displeasure to such a degree that he was obliged to leave England.
    
    
      For a long time Mary had been her mother's daily companion, but when she
      was about fifteen years of age she was separated from her, never to behold
      her again. This was such a source of grief to the young girl that she
      became seriously ill on account of it. Katherine wrote her daughter loving
      letters, and tried to console her for the loss of her instruction in Latin
      by assuring her that Dr. [019] a
      name="link019" id="link019">Fetherstone was a much better teacher, but
      she never complained of the cause of their separation in any of her
      correspondence.
    
    
      A.D. 1532. It was not until after the birth of
      Elizabeth that the king disinherited his daughter Mary, and declared her
      half-sister his heiress. Then orders were sent to her to lay aside the
      name and dignity of princess and remove to Hatfield, where the nursery of
      her infant sister was about to be established.
    
    
      Mary was but seventeen at this time, but she showed a good deal of
      courage, when she told the messenger that she should not take the
      slightest notice of the order unless it were delivered to her in the
      king's own hand and bore his signature.
    
    
      Then she wrote a private letter to her father, asking him whether he
      really meant to deprive her of her title. He did not condescend to reply,
      but a couple of months later her household, consisting of no less than
      three hundred and sixty persons, was suddenly broken up, and the poor girl
      was separated from the Countess of Salisbury and others, to whose society
      she had been accustomed during her whole life.
    
    
      This was a blow far more bitter than being deprived of her title. Another
      trial it was to find herself no more than a dependent in her sister's
      household, which was fitted up with the magnificence she herself had just
      been robbed of. The comparison that she was daily forced to draw between
      the position of her infant sister and her own was enough to make her hate
      the child, but, strange to say, her affection for it was strong; and good
      Margaret Bryan, who had been her nurse, and was now performing the same
      service for Elizabeth, did all in her power to soothe the mind of her
      former charge, and encourage kindly feelings for her little sister.  span
      class="pagenum">[020]Mary spent
      two years of sorrow and suffering at Hatfield Castle, where her stepmother
      treated her with extreme unkindness, and during that time several persons
      were sent to the Tower for calling her "Princess." This no doubt added
      greatly to her unhappiness. Besides, she was closely watched, and although
      allowed to read and study, writing was forbidden until after the death of
      Anne Boleyn, when in one of her letters she apologized for her bad
      penmanship on the ground that she had had no practice for two years.
    
    
      A.D. 1535. Her position was so dreadful that
      most people pitied her, and the king was heard to mutter such harsh
      threats against her that it would not have occasioned much surprise if her
      head had been brought to the block. Her dying mother begged that she might
      have the satisfaction of knowing that Mary was near her, even though she
      were not permitted to see her, but the tyrant Henry refused, though the
      poor girl's health was suffering for want of her mother's tender care and
      affection. Even the sad satisfaction of a last farewell between the dying
      queen and her only child was forbidden, and Katherine of Arragon departed
      from this world without laying eyes on her daughter.
    
    
      Mary wrote her father a congratulatory letter when he married Jane
      Seymour, but he took no notice of it, nor addressed her in any way until
      she was requested through his privy councillor to sign a paper renouncing
      all right to the throne. She could not have been induced to do this while
      her mother lived, but she was so broken down from sorrow and ill health
      that she no longer had the power to resist.
    
    
      Then she was settled again in a household, with her little sister, at
      Hunsdon, which, though comfortable and peaceful, was poor and humble
      compared with what she had [021] a
      name="link021" id="link021">enjoyed at Ludlow Castle. Mary was her own
      mistress there for three years, and spent most of the time in study,
      dividing off her day as she had been taught to do when under her mother's
      care. She studied astronomy, geography, natural philosophy, and
      mathematics, as well as Latin and Greek authors; read the church service
      daily with her chaplain, did a good deal of needle-work, and practised on
      three musical instruments. Latin was the universal language, so she spoke
      it with ease, and could read and write French, Spanish, and Italian
      besides.
    
    
      A.D. 1537. She was not admitted to her father's
      presence until 1537, when, strange to say, although her tastes were
      refined, and her life a busy one, her journal contained items of high play
      at cards, and a fondness for betting and gambling, which was one of the
      vices of Henry's court, he himself being one of the greatest gamblers that
      ever wore a crown.
    
    
      A.D. 1538 The year 1538 was filled with horrors
      on account of the serious insurrections of the Catholics, who in every
      case of disturbance demanded that the Princess Mary should be restored to
      her royal rank. This certainly placed her in a dangerous position, and it
      is rather surprising that she did not have her head chopped off in
      consequence, for the most dreadful executions took place; people were
      burnt alive or butchered in cold blood, and members of some of the noblest
      families in England perished on the scaffold.
    
    
      The aged Countess of Salisbury, Mary's beloved friend, was locked up in
      the Tower, and all her property taken from her. She was not spared
      sufficient means to purchase warm clothing to shelter her infirm limbs,
      and the Marchioness of Exeter, with her little son, shared the same fate,
      though the boy was too young to have committed any offence.  span
      class="pagenum">[022]The chief
      crime of these ladies was their friendship for Reginald Pole, who was
      accused of supporting the claims of Katherine of Arragon, Mary's mother.
      The existence of the young princess was rendered miserable by the wretched
      fate of those she loved, yet she was powerless to render them the
      slightest assistance.
    
    
      Towards the close of the following year, Wriothesley, the
      privy-councillor, was sent to inform her that her father desired her to
      receive Duke Philip of Bavaria as a suitor. But Mary declined because she
      did not desire to marry at all, and would on no account ally herself to a
      Protestant.
    
    
      A.D. 1539. The day after Anne of Cleves made her
      public entry into England, Henry appointed Philip Knight of the Garter on
      account of his defence of Vienna against the Turks, and he was the first
      Protestant who ever received that honor. Before he returned to Germany he
      presented Mary with a diamond cross, and expressed his intention of coming
      to claim her as his bride. She was spared the hardship of a struggle in
      opposing him because Henry's ill treatment of Anne of Cleves prevented the
      return of the brave German, who lived and died a bachelor.
    
    
      A.D. 1540. In 1540 Mary was very ill at her
      brother's residence; the cause of it was probably the dreadful events that
      took place in England during that and the following year; for it was then
      that all her early friends, including Dr. Fetherstone and the Countess of
      Salisbury, were so shamefully butchered. It must be remembered that these
      were people whose lives were in every respect honorable and virtuous, but
      they were firmly attached to Queen Katherine and opposed to Henry in
      religious matters, and that was the head and front of their offending.
    
    
      A.D. 1543. In 1543 Mary was present at the
      marriage of her father with Katherine Parr, and accompanied the royal
      couple when they made their summer trip through [023] a
      name="link023" id="link023">several counties in England. But she was
      seized with an attack of her former illness, when she was sent to
      Ashbridge, where, with her brother and sister, she spent the autumn. While
      there she worked a chain as a New-year's gift for her father, and it had
      to be so large for that corpulent personage that the materials for it cost
      twenty pounds.
    
    
      By the close of the year a delightful change took place in her life; she
      was restored to her rightful succession after Edward VI. by an act of
      parliament, and took up her residence at court.
    
    
      A.D. 1547. Having made friends with her father
      once more, she continued in favor till the end of his life, and when he
      was dying he said to her: "I know well, my daughter, that fortune has been
      most adverse to you, that I have caused you infinite sorrow, and that I
      have not given you in marriage as I intended to do; this was, however,
      according to the will of God, or to the unhappy state of my affairs, or to
      your own ill-luck; but I pray you to take it all in good part, and promise
      me to be a kind and loving mother to your brother, whom I shall leave a
      little helpless child."
    
    
      In his will he bequeathed to her the sum of ten thousand pounds towards
      her marriage portion, and an income of three thousand pounds a year so
      long as she remained unmarried.
    
    
      He requested that his son should be brought up in the Catholic faith,
      which was a serious impediment to the Protestant church in England, and
      proved the cause of a great deal of strife among his subjects.
    
    
      Before parliament met, after King Henry's death, the Protestant protector,
      Somerset, had, with Cranmer's assistance, taken decided steps for the
      establishment of the Reformed faith, and Bishop Gardiner was locked up in
      the Fleet Prison. [024] a name="link024"
      id="link024">Mary was very anxious that her brother should be brought
      up a Catholic, and had a long controversy in writing with Somerset on that
      subject. It seems strange that her pen should have done any work for the
      Protestant church when she always opposed it, yet so it was, and her name
      appeared in the preface of the Gospel of St. John as translator.
    
    
      A.D. 1548. Though Mary seldom attended her
      brother's court, she spent the following Christmas with him, and at that
      time they were on the most affectionate terms. She visited him again at
      St. James' Palace in 1548, and had a regular suite of reception rooms for
      her own use, where she entertained a number of friends in the most
      sumptuous style.
    
    
      Two years later she was so ill that her death was generally expected. Had
      she died then how differently would her name have appeared in history! The
      hatred between Catholics and Protestants would have been less, and the
      horrible persecutions in Great Britain for religion's sake would never
      have taken place. But it was destined otherwise.
    
    
      A.D. 1550. During this severe illness Mary had a
      long correspondence with Somerset, who urged her to join the Protestant
      faith, but she remained firm until, by a sudden turn of events, the
      protector was deposed by Dudley, Cranmer, and Northampton, who did not
      rest until they had brought about his execution. But she had further
      struggles to make for her religion; for when Dudley succeeded Somerset he
      had her chaplains arrested, and wanted to prevent her from having church
      service at all. She made an appeal to Charles V., whose ambassador
      espoused her cause, and demanded that the Princess Mary should have her
      mass. It was refused, whereupon the Emperor threatened war with England if
      Mary were not permitted
    
    
      [025]
    
    
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Original
    
    
      [027]to
      worship as she pleased. Several persons, women as well as men, were burned
      to death at this period for adhering to the Catholic faith, and the
      Emperor Charles V. had several ships off the east coast of England to
      receive Mary and convey her to his sister, the Queen of Hungary, for
      protection, if necessary. King Edward gave orders that his sister should
      be carefully watched lest she might be stolen away, then invited her to
      visit him, saying that the air of Essex was bad for her health, but she
      refused to leave.
    
    
      Throughout the winter the controversy continued with regard to the form of
      worship in her chapel, the chief complaint against her being that she
      permitted all her neighbors to flock there in crowds, and that she had
      mass celebrated at the parish churches by her chaplains. At last she was
      so persecuted that she resolved to appeal, in person, to her brother for
      relief from the interruption his ministers were causing to her worship.
      She mounted her horse, and attended by a train of ladies and gentlemen,
      each wearing a black rosary and cross hanging at the side, rode through
      Fleet street to Westminster. This display was very irritating to the
      Protestant court, but Mary had a two hours' interview with her brother,
      with whom she dined, and with his permission returned to Newhall in Essex
      the next day, after taking a most affectionate leave of him. He treated
      her very kindly, and made no objection when she assured him "that her soul
      was God's, and her faith she would not change."
    
    
      King Edward always felt somewhat hurt because she refused to make long
      visits at his court; but even had there been no difference in religious
      opinions, the forms and ceremonies imposed on everybody would have been
      irksome to one in Mary's poor health.
    
    
      After the princess had seen her brother she was left [028] a
      name="link028" id="link028">undisturbed for awhile, and then, without
      the slightest warning, Francis Mallet, her head chaplain, was seized and
      confined in the Tower, with a person in the same cell to watch what he
      said and did. Mallet was a learned man, and one whom Mary esteemed so
      highly that when he was dragged off to prison she wrote to her brother and
      his council, complaining of the injustice; but they took no notice of her
      whatever, and she continued to have her religious service celebrated by
      her remaining chaplains.
    
    
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Original
    
    
      This went on for a few months, when the king and his council summoned the
      chief officers of Mary's household before them, among whom was Rochester,
      her comptroller, and charged them to inform their mistress that she must
      immediately stop having mass at her court. When they delivered their
      message, which they did most unwillingly, the princess forbade them to
      repeat it to her chaplains or to anybody else in her service, and told
      them that if they failed to obey her they must cease to consider her their
      mistress; moreover, she would leave the house at once. She was so much
      excited during this interview that the [029] a
      name="link029" id="link029">messengers begged her to take a few days
      to consider the matter. She did so, but at the end of the specified time
      she was firm as ever, and wrote her brother humbly but decidedly that she
      would sacrifice her life rather than what she conceived to be her
      religious duties.
    
    
      Edward VI. sent for her officers again, and bade them to use their
      influence with Mary's whole household in order that she might be prevented
      by them from continuing the Catholic service. They refused absolutely to
      interfere, saying that it was against their consciences, and were locked
      up in the Tower forthwith.
    
    
      Having failed with Mary's officers, the king now decided to try what his
      own could accomplish. Accordingly three of them were sent to her,
      accompanied by a gentleman who was to perform the Protestant service for
      her, whether she consented or not.
    
    
      When they informed Mary of their errand she said that her health was poor
      and she did not wish to be troubled with a long interview, particularly as
      she had already informed the king by letter of her intention.
    
    
      They wanted to read her the list of councillors who had voted that she
      should not have private mass in her house, but she would not hear it, and
      replied, "Rather than use any other service than that ordained during the
      life of my father I will lay my head on the block; but I am unworthy to
      suffer death in so good a cause. And though the good, sweet king have more
      knowledge than others of his years, yet it is not possible for him to be a
      judge of all things; for instance, if ships were to be sent to sea, I am
      sure you would not think him able to decide what should be done, and much
      less can he, at his age, judge in questions of divinity. As for my
      priests, they may act as they choose, but none of your new service shall
      be said in any house of mine, and if any be said in it, I will not tarry
      in it an hour." [030] a name="link030"
      id="link030">When they told her how her officers had refused to return
      to her with the second message, she was highly gratified, and said, "It
      was not the wisest of councils that sent her own servants to control her
      in her own house, for she was least likely to obey those who had always
      been used to obey her." Then she added, "If they refused to do your
      message, they are the honestest men I know."
    
    
      These officers were kept in prison as long as Edward VI. reigned, but Mary
      remembered and rewarded their fidelity afterwards.
    
    
      After some more useless urging on the part of the king's councillors, Mary
      gave them a ring to carry to her brother, kneeling as she did so, and
      saying, "that she would die his true subject and sister, and obey him in
      all things except matters of religion;" then she departed into her
      bedchamber.
    
    
      But the messengers were not satisfied, so they summoned the chaplains of
      Mary's household and threatened them with condign punishment if they
      performed any service but that contained in the Common Prayer Book.
    
    
      The chaplains objected at first, but afterwards promised to obey. Mary was
      not baffled yet, for she had hidden away one of them and he could not be
      found. While search was made for him high and low, the king's messengers
      waited in the courtyard; and the princess threw open her window, and
      laughingly called out to them, "I pray you ask the lords of the castle
      that Rochester may shortly return; for since his departing I keep the
      accounts myself, and lo, I have learned how many loaves of bread be made
      of a bushel of wheat! My father and mother never brought me up to brewing
      and baking! and to be plain with you, I am a-weary of mine office. If my
      lords will send my officer home again, they will do me a pleasure;
      otherwise, if they will send him to prison, beshrew me, if he go not to it
      merrily [031]and
      with a good will! And I pray God to send you well in your souls, and in
      your bodies too, for some of you have but weak ones."
    
    
      The deputation did not care to hear anything more that Mary had to say,
      but departed without finding the missing chaplain, who, not having made
      any promise, performed the forbidden service as usual.
    
    
      A.D. 1552. In 1552 King Edward had both the
      measles and small-pox, which left him in such a low state of health that
      he died the following year.
    
    
      His true condition was kept secret, and while he was dangerously ill a
      splendid bridal festival was held at Durham House, on the occasion of a
      double marriage between Lady Jane Grey and Lord Guildford Dudley, and
      between Katherine Grey, sister to Jane, and the heir of the Earl of
      Pembroke.
    
    
      Rather more than a month after this ceremony King Edward expired. He left
      a will that disinherited his Catholic sister, Mary, and his Protestant
      sister, Elizabeth, and bestowed the crown on Lady Jane Grey. Then the
      guard was doubled around the royal apartments, and the late king's council
      sent a message to Mary that her brother was very ill and desired to see
      her. She was highly pleased that his affection should have prompted him to
      send for her, and set out immediately. Before reaching the palace,
      however, she was met by a mysterious messenger in disguise, who informed
      her that the king was dead, and that if she fell into the hands of his
      council she would be imprisoned in the Tower.
    
    
      Mary was sorely perplexed, for she asked herself:
    
    
      "Might not this messenger have been sent by an enemy, to draw her into a
      snare, and induce her to proclaim herself queen while her brother was
      still alive?" Such an act would have been treason, and would, of course,
      have led [032]to
      her ruin. However, after mature reflection, she resolved not to despise
      the warning, but turned from the London road towards Suffolk. She spent
      that night at Sawston Hall, in the neighborhood of Cambridge. Mr.
      Huddleston, who was living there, was a zealous Roman Catholic, and
      received the princess and her train cheerfully, though he was well aware
      that he was taking a risk, for all his neighbors were opposed to Mary, and
      would not hesitate to attack him for extending hospitality to her.
    
    
      His fears were not without foundation, for when the princess reached the
      top of the hill early next morning, as she proceeded on her way, she
      beheld the whole building in which she had passed the night in flames. A
      party from Cambridge, hearing of her arrival, had set the place on fire,
      but had they known of her departure they might have seized her bodily.
      "Let it blaze," said Mary, "I will build Huddleston a better."
    
    
      She kept her word; for the present Sawston Hall was built entirely at her
      expense.
    
    
      She travelled all day, and reached her seat of Kenninghall, in Norfolk,
      the same night. By that time Edward's death was known, and it was
      necessary for her to assert her title to the throne at once.
    
    
      She wrote to the council, expressing her sorrow at her brother's death,
      and stating that she knew what their intention had been towards her, but
      assured them that if they would proclaim her in London as their sovereign
      they should be pardoned.
    
    
      The following day, July 10, they proclaimed Lady Jane Grey Queen of
      England.
    
    
      Mary was determined to maintain her right, and displayed both courage and
      prudence in the way she set to work.
    
    
      She decided to leave Kenninghall, because the country

      Original
    
    
      [035]was
      too open, and the house not strong enough to withstand a siege. Two
      Norfolk gentlemen brought all their tenantry to her aid, and, mounted on
      horseback, she proceeded towards Framlingham, in Suffolk, attended by her
      faithful knights and ladies. They arrived at the castle before night. It
      was situated on a hill, surrounded by three circles of moats, and
      everything was in thorough repair for defence, which the valiant knights
      and armed citizens prepared to undertake. Surrounded by the circling
      towers of Framlingham Castle, Mary felt herself a sovereign, indeed, and
      defied her enemies by displaying her standard over the gate tower. She
      assumed the title of Queen-regnant of England and Ireland.

      CHAPTER II.
    
    
      A.D. 1553.
    
    
      T The royal
      standard of England had not floated many hours over the towers of
      Framlingham Castle before the knights and gentlemen of Suffolk flocked
      around Queen Mary, bringing their tenants with them, all completely armed.
      About five days later six ships-of-war sailed along the Suffolk coast
      towards Yarmouth Roads, with the intention of besieging Mary's castle.
    
    
      Sir Henry Jerningham, one of the gentlemen who had attended her from
      Norfolk, happened to be at Yarmouth when the fleet entered the harbor,
      pretending that they were forced to do so on account of stormy weather.
      Sir Henry boldly went out in a boat to hail them. The soldiers on board
      the ships asked him what he wanted. "Your captains," replied the
      courageous knight; "who are rebels to their lawful Queen Mary."
    
    
      "If they are," said the men, "we will throw them into the sea, for we are
      her true subjects."
    
    
      The captains surrendered themselves, and Sir Henry took possession of the
      ships.
    
    
      At the same time Sir Edward Hastings was sent to two counties to raise
      four thousand men for Queen Jane. As soon as he had secured them, he
      proclaimed Mary as his rightful queen, and thus placed a large force at
      her disposal, close to London.
    
    
      Jane Grey's council, headed by Northumberland, were terrified when they
      heard of these two events, and still more so when placards were posted on
      the churches a few [037] a name="link037"
      id="link037">days later, stating that Mary had been proclaimed Queen
      of England and Ireland in every town and city excepting London. A
      revolution was the result, which ended in the arrest of Northumberland,
      who was sent to the Tower. Then several of his party hastened to
      Framlingham to excuse themselves to Mary. Among these were Dr. Sandys,
      Bishop Ridley, Northampton, and Lord Robert Dudley, all of whom were
      arrested.
    
    
      On the last day of July Mary broke up her camp, and began her triumphant
      march towards London. Her sister Elizabeth, at the head of a cavalcade of
      nobility and gentry, amounting to a thousand persons, rode out to meet
      her.
    
    
      Queen Mary travelled slowly and stopped many times, not arriving at her
      seat of Wanstead until August 3. From thence she proceeded with great pomp
      to London.
    
    
      One of Mary's first acts after she ascended the throne was to forbid the
      lord mayor to allow any reading of the Scriptures or preaching by the
      curates unless licensed by her. This was the first blow aimed at the
      Protestant Church in England by her.
    
    
      The trial of Northumberland, and others of his party, took place August
      18, when eleven were condemned to die, though only the earl and two others
      were really executed. Then the ambassadors from Rome urged Mary to bring
      Lady Jane Grey to trial, but she replied that she could not find it in her
      heart to put her unfortunate kinswoman to death, for she had been merely a
      tool in the hands of others, and her existence could be no possible danger
      to herself.
    
    
      Queen Mary continued to love her sister Elizabeth, took her with her
      wherever she went, and never dined in public without her. She was
      extremely kind to her Cousin Courtenay too, and appointed a nobleman to
      instruct and guide him. [038] a name="link038"
      id="link038">About the middle of August she had an interview with the
      Pope's envoy, and told him that she had concluded a league with the
      Emperor, and had made up her mind to marry his heir, Prince Philip. She
      also expressed a wish that her kingdom might be reconciled to Rome, and
      that Cardinal Pole be sent to her.
    
    
      Violent struggles were constantly taking place between the two church
      parties for possession of the various churches and pulpits, many of which
      were determined by hand-to-hand fights.
    
    
      Mary was anxious to restore the supremacy of the pope, but Bishop Gardiner
      was opposed to it, and wanted her to retain her title as head of the
      English Church. She replied to him: "I have read in Scripture that women
      are forbidden to speak in the church. Is it then proper that your church
      should have a dumb head?"
    
    
      Mary felt the full weight of the responsibility that her father had
      assumed for himself, and imposed upon his successors by separating the
      Church of England from the authority of Rome, and feared to undertake it.
      The party that sided with her was the weakest in numbers of the three that
      then existed in England. The other two consisted of the Catholics opposed
      to the pope, established by Henry VIII., which was the strongest, and the
      Protestant Church of England, established by the regency of Edward VI.
    
    
      Mary's ministers belonged to the party of Henry VIII., and had aided him
      in his religious persecutions and his other acts of cruelty, but they had
      been long used to governing, and she had no other choice than to retain
      them.
    
    
      It was Cranmer, aided by Somerset, who, after the death of Henry,
      established a church on Protestant principles, and then began the intense
      hatred between the leaders of the two parties. If Lady Jane Grey had
      succeeded to the [039] a name="link039"
      id="link039">throne. Cranmer would have remained in power as
      Archbishop of Canterbury, and the Protestant religion would undoubtedly
      have gained the upper hand; but the Catholic Mary deprived him of his
      office, and put Gardiner in power instead. This bishop changed a prison
      for the seat of lord-chancellor in an astonishingly short space of time.
      Then Cranmer was requested to retire to his house at Lambeth and live
      there privately. The Protestants misunderstood this move, and accused him
      of joining the ranks of the enemy, whereupon he published an explanation
      of his creed. The queen's council regarded this as an attack on the
      government, and sent him to the Tower, where he remained for three years,
      only to suffer horrible martyrdom at last.
    
    
      On one point all parties were agreed, and that was disapproval of the
      queen's engagement to the Prince of Spain. The Emperor Charles, knowing
      how strongly Cardinal Pole would oppose it, stopped him on his journey to
      England and detained him in a German convent until after the marriage had
      taken place.
    
    
      Philip was only twenty-six years old, and would have preferred a younger
      wife, but his father thought political power of far greater importance
      than domestic happiness, so he made Mary a formal offer in writing of his
      son's hand on the 20th of September, which took place with a great deal of
      regal splendor, magnificent festivities, etc.
    
    
      Meantime the queen occupied herself in forming her household, and
      rewarding the personal friends who had been faithful to her by placing
      them in high office. She also indulged her fondness for music by selecting
      the best singers and performers that could be found for her royal chapel.
    
    
      Four days after the coronation Mary opened her first parliament in state,
      and Bishop Gardiner as lord-chancellor [040] a
      name="link040" id="link040">made an oration showing causes "wherefore
      the virtuous and mighty Princess Mary, by the grace of God, Queen of
      England, France, and Ireland, defender of the faith, and head of the
      church, had summoned her parliament."
    
    
      They found plenty of work to do in repealing old laws and establishing new
      ones. Mary retained her power as head of the church of Henry VIII. for a
      year and a half, but the cruelties of her reign did not begin until she
      ceased to have that control.
    
    
      While parliament sat Lady Jane Grey was brought to trial and sentenced to
      death on a charge of high treason. The same sentence was passed on her
      husband and Cranmer.
    
    
      Gardiner's influence over the queen was so powerful that he induced her to
      burn the Protestant translations of the gospels. Thus, one of Queen Mary's
      first acts as head of the church was the destruction of her own learned
      work.
    
    
      Considerable pains were taken by Mary's enemies to create ill feeling
      between her and Elizabeth, but without success, and when the young
      princess went to live at her palace at Ashbridge the two sisters parted in
      the most friendly manner.
    
    
      After Elizabeth left, the queen had a severe spell of illness that
      confined her to her bed for several weeks.
    
    
      Early in January Count Egmont came to England as ambassador from Spain, to
      conclude the marriage treaty between Mary and Philip. He was almost torn
      to pieces when he landed in Kent, so opposed were all the British subjects
      to this union. But the queen was determined to marry whom she pleased, and
      after an interview with the count she told him that he might confer with
      her ministers. [041] a name="link041"
      id="link041">On the 14th the articles of the queen's marriage were
      communicated to the lord-mayor and the city of London.
    
    
      They agreed that each sovereign was to govern his kingdom separately. None
      but natives of England were to hold offices in the queen's court or even
      in the service of her husband. If the queen had a child it was to succeed
      to her dominions. Her majesty was never to be carried out of her dominions
      without her special request, and Philip was not to engage England in his
      father's French wars, nor to appropriate any of the revenue, ships,
      ammunition, or crown jewels of England.
    
    
      A.D. 1554. The week after these articles became
      public three insurrections broke out in different parts of the realm. Two
      of them were soon suppressed, and their leaders, who had proclaimed Lady
      Jane Grey queen in every town, fled; but the third was headed by Sir
      Thomas Wyatt, a young man of twenty-three, who was not so easily managed.
      He was a Catholic, but when a boy he had accompanied his father on an
      embassy to Spain, and remembered how nearly that parent had become a
      victim to the inquisition. This made him fear and detest the Spanish
      government, and his motive of revolt was to prevent similar tyranny from
      being established in England, by the marriage of the Queen and Philip of
      Spain.
    
    
      Wyatt's rebellion began in Kent, whither Mary sent the aged Duke of
      Norfolk with her guards and artillery, accompanied by five hundred of the
      London trained companies of soldiers, commanded by Captain Brett. This
      person was secretly in league with Wyatt, and actually went over to his
      side when they met at Rochester. This treasonable act caused the loss of
      the queen's artillery, and gave such encouragement to the rebels that
      Wyatt advanced to Deptford with fifteen thousand men. There he dictated
      his own terms, which were that the queen and [042] a
      name="link042" id="link042">her council were to be surrendered into
      his hands. Mary had too much pluck and determination to listen to such an
      absurd demand, and prepared for open war.
    
    
      The whole city was filled with consternation when the desertion of the
      Duke of Norfolk's forces was known, for every one was aware that the
      defences of the royal residence at Westminster were weak. All the queen's
      council, chaplains, and bishops went about with a complete suit of armor
      underneath their customary clothing, prepared to fight when the time came.
    
    
      The queen remained calm and collected. She ordered her horse, and attended
      by her ladies and councillors, rode to London, where she made such an
      eloquent speech, encouraging the citizens to stand by her and put down the
      rebellion, that the crowd who filled Guildhall and its court shouted, "God
      save Queen Mary and the Prince of Spain!".
    
    
      She was then rowed to Westminster, where she held a council, appointing
      the Earl of Pembroke general of her troops, then gathering to defend St.
      James's Palace and Whitehall.
    
    
      In the meantime Wyatt, finding the city too strongly defended on the river
      side, decided to move his forces, but before doing so Winchester House was
      plundered, and Bishop Gardiner's books so torn to pieces as to leave not a
      single one in his whole library fit for use.
    
    
      At two o'clock one morning a deserter from the rebels arrived at the
      palace of Whitehall with the information that the enemy would be at Hyde
      Park Corner within two hours. The bustle and alarm that ensued may be
      better imagined then described. Barricades were raised at the points
      liable to attack, guards were stationed at the queen's chamber-windows and
      private apartments, and the palace echoed with the sobs and cries of the
      ladies. But Mary [043] a name="link043"
      id="link043">did not lose her presence of mind for a moment, and when
      her ministers and councillors crowded around her imploring her to take
      refuge in the Tower, she answered: "That she would set no example of
      cowardice; and if Pembroke and Clinton proved true to their posts she
      would not desert hers."
    
    
      At four o'clock the drums beat to arms, but the rain was pouring in
      torrents on that cold winter's morning, and delayed the rebels until nine
      o'clock. Wyatt divided his army into three parts, and a desperate battle
      was the result of their attack. Queen Mary stood at a window, whence she
      not only saw the struggle, but spoke brave words to the soldiers who came
      near enough to hear her, and scouted at any one who approached her with a
      discouraging report.
    
    
      Within the palace the utmost terror reigned, the women running from place
      to place shrieking, banging doors and windows, and keeping up an uproar
      dreadful to hear.
    
    
      Just before Pembroke made the final charge, which decided the fortune of
      the day, the queen actually came out of the palace and stood between two
      armed men within range of the enemy's shot.
    
    
      At last Wyatt sank down in the street exhausted and discouraged; he was
      taken prisoner and locked up in the Tower. Thus ended the rebellion; but
      the consequence of it was that the queen was beset from all sides with
      requests for the execution of Lady Jane Grey, who had been the innocent
      cause of it. Those who demanded this execution said that such scenes of
      fighting and bloodshed would occur again and again unless the unfortunate
      Lady Jane were put out of the way. Mary yielded at last, and signed the
      death warrant of "Guildford Dudley and his wife," to be executed on the
      9th of February, two days later. To Dr. Feckenham, the queen's chaplain,
      fell the duty of preparing poor Lady Jane for this hurried  span
      class="pagenum">[044]death. He
      did not succeed in turning her mind from the Protestant faith, but he won
      her friendship and gratitude, and her last words were of the kindness she
      had received from him.
    
    
      When told that she was to die so soon, she said: "That she was prepared to
      receive her death in any manner it would please the queen to appoint. She
      shuddered at the thought, as was natural; but her spirit would spring
      rejoicingly into the eternal light, where she hoped the mercy of God would
      receive it."
    
    
      The execution of this lovely, innocent young woman and her husband is a
      frightful stain on Mary's name, even though she was urged to it in order
      to prevent further civil wars.
    
    
      The city presented a ghastly spectacle at that time; for the deserters
      under Brett were all hung, many of them at their own doors, so that
      dangling corpses met the eye at every turn of the street.
    
    
      The prisoners of Wyatt's army, amounting to five hundred, were led to the
      tilt-yard at Whitehall, with ropes about their necks; then the queen
      appeared in the gallery above and pronounced the pardon of all. This is a
      proof that Mary was far more merciful than her ministers, who wanted them
      brought to trial. She was very lenient in her conduct towards her sister,
      Elizabeth, too, when Sir Thomas Wyatt's confession gave her notice that
      the princess was quite as much a competitor for her crown as Lady Jane
      Grey had been.
    
    
      She sent her own litter for Elizabeth, who had been ill, and had her
      brought to Whitehall, where she was appointed a suite of apartments in a
      secure corner of the palace.
    
    
      Elizabeth had deceived her sister, and had carried on a secret
      correspondence with Wyatt and the King of France. Mary knew this, but
      remained her friend, although she [045] a
      name="link045" id="link045">would have no communication with her
      whatever until she could clear herself of having taken part in any act of
      treason.
    
    
      Courtenay was in disgrace, also, because he had corresponded with Wyatt,
      and was locked up in the Tower. The Spanish ambassador informed Mary that
      the marriage treaty between her and Prince Philip could not be concluded
      until both Elizabeth and Courtenay were punished; but the laws of England
      required an open act of treason to be proved before a person could be
      sentenced, and Mary was determined to abide by them.
    
    
      However, as no nobleman could be found willing to undertake the dangerous
      office of watching Elizabeth, she was imprisoned in the Tower also.
    
    
      In March Count Egmont returned to England, bringing Mary an engagement
      ring from Philip, which he presented before her whole court. She received
      it with thanks, and sent a kind message to the prince, who, she said, had
      not yet written to her.
    
    
      Renaud, the Spanish ambassador, kept continually calling her attention to
      the fact that Philip would not be safe in England until the rebels,
      especially Elizabeth and Courtenay, had been punished. But Mary put him
      off with some general remark each time, and thus dismissed the unwelcome
      subject. She had loved her sister from infancy, and was too constant in
      her affection to destroy her now. Gardiner was accused of protecting the
      princess; but it was only because of his friendship for Courtenay, with
      whom she was implicated in the rebellion, that he refrained from showing
      enmity towards her. He was really a friend to Courtenay, whose family had
      been martyrs to Catholicism, and for some time had been his
      fellow-prisoner in the Tower, where their attachment had been
      strengthened.
    
    
      On the 5th of May the queen, having recovered from a [046] a
      name="link046" id="link046">very severe spell of illness, dissolved
      parliament in person, and made such an eloquent address that she was
      interrupted five or six times by loud shouts of "Long live the queen!" and
      many persons wept.
    
    
      A couple of weeks later Elizabeth was removed from the Tower to Woodstock,
      where she was closely watched by part of the queen's guard, and Courtenay
      was sent to Fotheringay Castle, also under guard.
    
    
      The same week a Spanish grandee arrived in England to prepare for the
      reception of Prince Philip, to whom Queen Mary had written a letter
      announcing the consent of her parliament to their marriage.
    
    
      The prince embarked for England July 13, and meantime Mary retired with
      her council to Richmond Palace to decide what station her husband was to
      occupy. She considered it her duty to yield implicit obedience; and this
      notion was the cause of many crimes of which she was guilty later in life.
    
    
      When she asked whether her name or Philip's should be placed first in the
      legal documents, Renaud replied, indignantly, "that neither divine nor
      human laws would suffer his highness to be named last." She next wished to
      know whether he was to be crowned as king. Her council objected very
      decidedly, but agreed that the moment he touched English ground he should
      have a collar and mantle of the Garter worth two thousand pounds.
    
    
      When the news arrived that the combined fleets of England and Spain,
      amounting to one hundred and sixty sails, had made the port of
      Southampton, the queen was at Windsor Castle. Next day she set out with
      her bridal retinue for Winchester, where she intended her marriage to be
      celebrated.
    
    
      Don Philip landed July 20, 1554. A crowd of noblemen received the prince
      and presented him with the [047] a
      name="link047" id="link047">Order of the Garter, which was buckled
      below the knee, and the blue velvet mantle, fringed with gold and pearls.
      He mounted a horse presented by his royal bride, and rode straight to
      church, where he returned thanks for his safe voyage. Then he was
      conducted to the palace prepared for him.
    
    
      He was dressed simply in black velvet, his cap being trimmed with gold
      chains and a small feather. The shape of his head denoted ability; but his
      complexion was yellowish, his hair thin and sandy, and his eyes small,
      blue, and weak, which, added to a most disagreeably gloomy expression of
      countenance, rendered Philip of Spain anything but a handsome man.
    
    
      The following day being Friday. Don Philip went to mass, and the English
      nobles who attended him were much pleased with his courteous manners.
    
    
      On Sunday morning, Ruy Gomez de Silva, Philip's Grand Chamberlain, was
      sent to Queen Mary with a present of jewels valued at fifty thousand
      ducats. After mass the prince dined in public, and was waited upon by his
      newly-appointed English officers. He tried to make himself popular, told
      his attendants in Latin that he had come to live among them like an
      Englishman, and praised their ale, which he tasted for the first time in
      his life.
    
    
      The bridegroom and his suite mounted their horses and set out in a
      drenching rain on Monday morning for Winchester. He was escorted by the
      Earl of Pembroke, with two hundred and fifty cavaliers, a hundred archers,
      and four thousand spectators, who formed a procession.
    
    
      Don Philip was dressed as usual in black velvet, but on account of the
      rain he wore a large red-felt cloak, and a black hat. About a mile from
      Winchester two noblemen from the queen met the bridegroom, attended by six
      royal pages, dressed in cloth of gold, and mounted on large Flemish
      horses. [048]Between
      six and seven o'clock, the procession reached the city-gate, where the
      aldermen and mayor presented Don Philip with the keys of the city, which
      he returned. A volley of artillery greeted him, and twelve men, dressed in
      red and gold, conducted him to the Dean of Winchester's house, where he
      lived until after his marriage.
    
    
      Having changed his dress for a superb black velvet robe bordered with
      diamonds, he went to the cathedral, and after prayers held his first
      interview with Queen Mary, who received him very lovingly.
    
    
      The next afternoon at three o'clock the queen held a grand court, gave Don
      Philip a public audience, and kissed him in the presence of a large
      company. Then after they conversed for a while under the canopy of state,
      the prince was conducted to his residence by a torchlight procession.
    
    
      The marriage was performed next day. One of the Spanish grandees delivered
      a solemn oration, in which he announced that the emperor had resigned the
      kingdom of Naples in favor of his son, so that Mary married a king, not a
      prince. Then the ceremony proceeded in Latin and English, after which the
      royal pair returned hand in hand from the high altar and seated themselves
      until the mass was concluded, when they walked together under the same
      canopy to the hall where the banquet was spread.
    
    
      The seats for Queen Mary and her husband were on a dais under a canopy,
      where their table was laid. Below the dais were various tables for the
      queen's ladies, the Spanish grandees, their wives, and the English
      nobility. Bishop Gardiner dined at the royal table. A band of musicians
      played throughout the meal, and four heralds entered between the first and
      second courses and pronounced a Latin oration in praise of matrimony.
    
    
      After the banquet King Philip returned thanks to the council and nobles,
      and the queen spoke very graciously [049] a
      name="link049" id="link049">
    
    
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Original
    
    
      [051]in
      Spanish. At six o'clock the tables were removed and dancing began, which
      lasted until nine.
    
    
      The Spanish fleet sailed for Flanders next day, having first landed eighty
      of the most superb horses that ever were seen for Philip's use. Four of
      five hundred Spaniards, among whom were a number of fools and buffoons,
      were permitted to remain in England; but the queen's marriage articles
      forbade the presence of a large number, so the rest were obliged to return
      home.
    
    
      Within a week of their marriage the royal couple gave a sumptuous festival
      of the Garter at Windsor Castle to celebrate King Philip's admission to
      that order. Later there was a grand hunt, and a large number of deer were
      slaughtered.
    
    
      The usual pageantry attended the public entry into London, which was made
      with an imposing retinue of English nobles and Spanish grandees. Philip
      had brought over enough gold and silver to fill ninety-seven chests, each
      a yard and a quarter long. This treasure was piled on twenty carts and
      drawn through the city so that everybody might see it before it was taken
      to the Tower to be coined.
    
    
      Festivities were kept up until the Duke of Norfolk died, when, as Mary had
      loved him very much, the whole court was ordered to go into mourning. The
      queen retired to Hampton Court, where, with her husband, she lived very
      quietly until the opening of her third parliament, in November. Then she
      rode in procession, King Philip at her side, to her palace at Whitehall.
      She was very anxious that the lands her father had taken from the church
      should be restored, but her council would not consent because they
      declared she could not support the splendor of her crown if she deprived
      herself of these sources of revenue. She replied, "that she preferred the
      peace of her conscience to ten such crowns as England."  span
      class="pagenum">[052]Her reason
      for requesting the restoration of the church property was that Cardinal
      Pole was on his way to visit her, and she desired to be prepared for
      whatever instructions he might bear from the pope.
    
    
      Every mark of honor was bestowed on Pole when he arrived. He was rowed up
      the Thames to Whitehall, Bishop Gardiner received him at the water-gate,
      King Philip at the principal entrance, and Queen Mary herself at the head
      of the grand staircase.
    
    
      On the day appointed for Cardinal Pole's mission to be made known to
      parliament the queen was so ill that the proceedings took place in the
      audience chamber at Whitehall. Her majesty was carried to the throne,
      where King Philip sat at her left hand and Cardinal Pole at the right.
    
    
      Lord Chancellor Gardiner made the opening address, introducing the
      cardinal, who spoke eloquently of his own sufferings and exile, and
      pleaded the cause of the Roman Catholics and of the queen with such good
      effect that a petition for a reconciliation with the pope was prepared on
      the spot, and duly signed by each of the peers.
    
    
      This was presented to the royal couple next day, who, in the presence of
      parliament, delivered the document into the hands of the Roman ambassador,
      who thereupon solemnly pronounced absolution and benediction on all
      present.
    
    
      During this ceremony Mary's illness returned; but she was better by
      Christmas, which was celebrated with unusual splendor on account of the
      royal marriage and of the recent reconciliation to Rome. The Princess
      Elizabeth was enjoying the most friendly relations with her sister at that
      period, and took part in the festivities. She sat beside the queen at the
      state supper which was given in the great hall of Westminster, and
      attended by an assembly of English, Flemish, and Spanish nobles.  span
      class="pagenum">[053]The queen's
      illness had rendered her incapable of governing, so she can scarcely be
      held accountable for the cruel executions that took place, though she
      certainly took on measures to prevent them. Philip was the real sovereign,
      and viewed the burning of the two or three hundred martyrs of the
      Protestant Church with remarkable complacency.

      Fortunately for Bishop Coverdale, the translator of the English Bible, the
      King of Denmark wrote Queen Mary a [054] a
      name="link054" id="link054">letter claiming him for a subject,
      otherwise he too would have died at the stake.
    
    
      A.D. 1555. The sudden and unexpected abdication
      of the Emperor Charles V. called King Philip to Spain to receive the
      sceptre, and before he left Queen Mary removed from Hampton Court to
      Greenwich Palace. But whether in England or out of it, Philip was
      certainly ruler so long as his wife lived, and minute accounts of all
      church and state affairs were submitted to him during his absence. No
      power was legally given to him by parliament, but he coolly took it, and
      gave important orders without so much as consulting the queen.
    
    
      When not under her husband's bad influence Mary restored some wise laws,
      and the fact that insurrections ceased in her reign proves that the poor
      were not so destitute as they had been during the lives of her father and
      brother.
    
    
      Queen Mary was so ill throughout the rest of the year 1555 that she
      remained quietly at Greenwich, sometimes making excursions to the country,
      when she would enter the cottages of the poor and relieve their wants
      without revealing her identity. This was during Philip's absence; he
      returned for a short time in 1557 for the purpose of trying to involve
      England in a war with France. But Mary's finances were at a low ebb, and
      she did not feel justified in involving her kingdom in the expenses of a
      war. Philip's army was mustering near Calais, and in order to gratify him
      with as little cost as possible, she pardoned all the rebels in her
      prisons on condition that they would join it also. She raised money by
      borrowing small sums from those of her citizens who had any to spare, and
      paying them an enormous interest. Philip left England in the summer and
      never saw his wife again. He succeeded in taking possession of Calais, but
      the French gained it back a few months later. [055] a
      name="link055" id="link055">Queen Mary was in a most feeble condition
      when the Scotch made an invasion in the north of England, nevertheless she
      expressed her determination to head her army in person. She had all the
      energy required for such an exploit, but was soon convinced that her
      bodily health forbade it. Her troops, under Northumberland and
      Westmoreland, repulsed the Scotch and gained a decided victory over them.
    
    
      The rest of Queen Mary's life was filled with schemes for the recovery of
      Calais, a town highly prized by the English, because it was such an
      excellent spot for them to land whenever they desired to invade France. So
      many disputes were the result that, in her perplexity, Mary declared,
      "that should she die Calais would be found written upon her heart if her
      breast were opened."
    
    
      A.D. 1558. Her death was nearer than she
      suspected, for she contracted a malarial fever in the autumn of 1558, from
      which she did not recover. King Philip sent a message and a ring by Count
      de Feria when he heard of his wife's illness, and proposed that she should
      take measures for the recognition of her sister Elizabeth as her
      successor. Mary complied; and no sooner had she done so than her whole
      court flocked to Hatfield, anxious to prove their devotion to the princess
      who was soon to become their sovereign.
    
    
      While the last services of the church were being performed for her, on the
      morning of November 17, Queen Mary raised her eyes to heaven and expired.
    
    
      Her devoted and early friend, Cardinal Pole, died two days later.
    
    
      The queen's body was embalmed, and, after lying in state for a month, was
      interred at Westminster Abbey, on the north side of Henry VIIth's Chapel.

      CHAPTER III. ELIZABETH, SECOND QUEEN-REGNANT OF ENGLAND AND IRELAND.
    
    
      (A.D. 1533-1603.)
    
    
      Elizabeth was one
      of the most learned and distinguished queens that ever lived, and there is
      no other about whom so many celebrated authors have written.
    
    
      A.D. 1533. She was the daughter of Henry VIII.
      and Anne Boleyn, who were living at Greenwich Palace at the time of her
      birth. When she was four days old her christening was conducted with great
      pomp and ceremony,       the lord mayor, all the aldermen and council of
      the city of London, besides a great number of knights and lords, being
      present.
    
    
      Cranmer, the Archbishop of Canterbury, stood godfather on that occasion,
      the Duchess of Norfolk and the Marchioness of Dorset being godmothers. The
      gifts to the little princess consisted of costly gold cups, bowls, and
      salvers.
    
    
      Elizabeth did not remain with her parents; for the royal nursery was at
      Hunsdon, where, surrounded by every comfort and luxury that an infant
      could possibly need, she was lovingly tended by Lady Margaret Bryan. This
      lady had also taken charge of the Princess Mary, and had proved herself to
      be a woman of such rare sense and excellent qualities that she was
      eminently fitted for her post as superintendent of the household. While
      Anne Boleyn lived King Henry fondled and petted her little daughter; but
      after her head was cut off and her place supplied by another. span

      She was just four years of age, and the Earl of Hertford carried her in
      his arms to the font; but when the procession left the chapel the two
      Princesses, Mary and Elizabeth, walked out hand in hand, their trains
      being supported by noble ladies, who followed close behind.
    
    
      Fortunately for Elizabeth her early youth was passed in seclusion, which
      afforded opportunity for the cultivation of her mind, and thus prepared
      her for the exalted position she was to occupy later. [059] a
      name="link059" id="link059">other wife, his petting was succeeded by
      neglect and even cruelty, that must have been a sore trial to the child as
      well as to faithful Lady Bryan.
    
    
      A.D. 1537. Elizabeth was seen in public for the
      first time when her little brother, Edward VI., was christened.  span
      class="pagenum">[060]She and
      Prince Edward were warmly attached to each other, and he, at least, was
      never happier than while they were permitted to live together. It was she
      who gave him his earliest instruction in walking and talking, and it was
      to her that he turned for comfort in all his childish sorrows.
    
    
      A.D. 1539. When only six years of age Elizabeth
      presented her little brother with a shirt made entirely by her own hands;
      which proves that she must have learned to handle her needle at a very
      early age.
    
    
      As they grew older these children played and studied together, and Edward
      relied for advice on "his sweetest sister," as he loved to call her, until
      he was separated from her. It was their custom to rise at daylight and
      devote a couple of hours to religious exercises and the reading of
      Scripture. After breakfast they studied languages, science, and the works
      of the best authors; then Edward would seek exercise in the open air,
      while his sister occupied herself with her music or needlework.
    
    
      Edward's first real source of grief was his separation from this beloved
      sister when he ascended the throne. It was his desire to have her with him
      even then; but his selfish councillors, being jealous of any outside
      influence, interposed to prevent it.
    
    
      His devotion to Elizabeth lasted until death: she had been his earliest
      playmate, and no difference in religious views had ever risen to interfere
      with the congeniality that marked their intercourse. It was different with
      Mary, who was a rigid Roman Catholic, and always opposed the Protestant
      tendencies of her brother and sister.
    
    
      When Henry VIII. married Anne of Cleves, Elizabeth wrote her stepmother a
      most dutiful, affectionate letter, in which she expressed desire to make
      her acquaintance. An opportunity soon offered, when the queen was so
      charmed [061]with
      the wit and beauty of the young princess that at the time of her divorce
      she requested that they might be permitted the interchange of visits,
      which was granted.
    
    
      The next stepmother, Katherine Howard, loved Elizabeth too, and treated
      her with marked tenderness and consideration, giving her the place of
      honor near the throne at all public entertainments.
    
    
      With a view to strengthening the friendly relations between England and
      other countries, King Henry tried at various times to form an alliance for
      his daughter with several powerful princes; but fortunately for her all
      his plans fell through.
    
    
      Under the guidance of her fourth stepmother, Katherine Parr, who was a
      very learned woman, Elizabeth pursued her studies uninterrupted by any
      thought of matrimony, which at so early an age, and planned for state
      purposes, must have proved a misfortune.
    
    
      She lived in retirement with her father's widow for a year after his
      death; and though she set up an independent establishment of her own when
      she was fifteen years old, she and Katherine Parr continued to be fast
      friends as long as that lady lived.
    
    
      A.D. 1545. Even at that early age, Elizabeth was
      well-informed in geography, architecture, mathematics, and astronomy,
      besides being an accomplished Latin and Greek scholar. She spoke and wrote
      French, Italian, Spanish, and Flemish; but her favorite study was history,
      to which she devoted three hours a day.
    
    
      A.D. 1553. She displayed no small amount of
      shrewdness when her brother died, which was remarkable in so young a
      woman. Edward's illness had been concealed from his sisters by the wily
      statesmen who kept strict guard over him, and who had used every effort to
      foster the ill-feeling that existed between him and his relations. As
      [062]soon
      as his death occured they wrote Mary and Elizabeth that he was seriously
      ill, and desired their presence at his bedside. The object was to secure
      the two princesses, lock them up in prison, and proclaim Lady Jane Grey
      successor to the crown of England; but Elizabeth, suspecting some plot,
      took not the slightest notice of the letters. When the Duke of
      Northumberland offered her a liberal sum of money, besides a tract of
      land, providing she would resign her right of succession in favor of Lady
      Jane Grey, she replied, "that an agreement must first be made with her
      elder sister, during whose life she had no right nor title to resign."
    
    
      It was not without a difficult struggle that Mary got possession of the
      crown, and while it was going on Elizabeth pretended to be desperately ill
      and remained quietly at home. No sooner was it assured than she recovered
      and went in state, at the head of a large retinue, to welcome the new
      queen. Then the two sisters rode side by side, in grand procession through
      London, and were, apparently, on the best of terms. Nobody who witnessed
      that procession could fail to observe the contrast between the two royal
      ladies. Poor Mary, whose life had thus far been one of sadness, anxiety,
      and ill-health, sat on her horse almost bent double, and looking like a
      woman of middle age, although she was only twenty. Elizabeth, on the other
      hand, whose fine, majestic form and gracious manners won every heart as
      she smilingly bowed to the right and left, looked every inch a queen, and
      Mary sank into insignificance by her side. Her face, though not handsome,
      was pleasing, and her dark eyes shone with gratification at the attention
      she attracted. Throughout her life Elizabeth's delicate, well-formed hands
      were a source of pride to her, and she never lost an opportunity of
      displaying them to the best advantage. [063] a
      name="link063" id="link063">Within a month the affection that the two
      sisters entertained for each other was seriously impaired on account of
      their difference in religion, which created a great deal of ill-feeling.
      Elizabeth refused to attend mass, which, though gratifying to the
      Protestants, deeply grieved and offended Mary.
    
    
      The state councillors regarded Elizabeth's conduct in this matter as a
      mark of disrespect, and wanted to have her arrested; but the queen refused
      at first to take any extreme measures, and contented herself by turns with
      threats and persuasion.
    
    
      Elizabeth remained firm in her desire to appear as the heroine of the
      Reformers, though for the sake of policy she consented to read several
      religious books recommended by the queen, and even accompanied her once or
      twice to church. As a reward Mary bestowed many favors on the princess,
      and placed her in prominent positions on state occasions. This was just
      what Elizabeth sought; for she knew the importance of keeping herself
      before the nation, and never lost an opportunity of appearing as Mary's
      successor. Her manners were so gracious that she became a great favorite
      among the court ladies, and thus excited her sister's jealousy to such a
      degree that when a charge of treason was brought against her Mary lent a
      willing ear to it. Elizabeth was able to prove her innocence; but she felt
      so indignant at having been suspected that she requested permission to
      retire to the country and thus rid herself of court intrigue.
    
    
      She took up her abode in her own house at Ashbridge; but even there she
      was not left in peace, for the queen was anxious to have her marry the
      Spanish Prince, Philibert of Savoy, and the King of France was constantly
      making her offers of protection and aid if she would only assert her claim
      to the throne. He even proceeded so far as to advise [064] a
      name="link064" id="link064">her to go to France, which would have been
      a most unwise move on her part, and wrote her letters in a secret
      language. This had the effect of rendering her position extremely
      critical; but fortunately Elizabeth's judgment was so excellent that she
      knew how to save herself from the friends who would unintentionally have
      done her more harm, had she taken their advice, than her enemies.
    
    
      A.D. 1554. She was recalled to court at the time
      of the insurrection under Wyatt, because she and Courtenay were accused of
      having urged it with a view to getting the Protestant party into power.
      She was quite ill when the summons reached her, but obeyed it as soon as
      possible, and chanced to arrive in London on the very day of the execution
      of Lady Jane Grey. No doubt she trembled for the safety of her own head
      while the queen was daily signing the death-warrants of those who really
      had turned against her or appeared to have done so. The public mind was in
      such a state of excitement on account of the numerous executions that were
      taking place, that many wept as the young princess rode through the
      streets attended by a guard of honor, consisting of a hundred gentlemen,
      for they supposed that she was being led to the block. Dressed in a robe
      of pure white, Elizabeth sat up in a litter and looked around with a
      proud, lofty air. Her youthful appearance touched many a heart; but not
      one arm or voice, in all the multitude that had assembled to gaze upon
      her, was raised in her defence.
    
    
      With a retinue of six of her ladies, two gentlemen, and four servants, she
      was lodged in a wing of Westminster Palace; and although she knew that the
      privy council were debating as to whether she should be executed or no,
      she was unable to get sight of her sister or to plead her cause in any
      way.

      Original
    
    
      [067]Many
      charges were brought against the princess, but Mary's conscience forbade
      the shedding of her sister's blood; so, after a few weeks' deliberation,
      she shut her up in the Tower.
    
    
      Elizabeth's letters to the queen, asserting her innocence, were unnoticed.
      She was forbidden to use English prayer-books, and compelled to hear mass.
      Two of her ladies who objected to this were dismissed by the queen's
      orders and replaced by Catholics. At first she was kept in close
      confinement, but after a while her health began to suffer, and she was
      permitted to take exercise in a little enclosed garden.
    
    
      The officers and servants about the prison were respectful and attentive
      to the royal lady, and their children would bring her flowers from time to
      time. Her love of children was great throughout her whole life, and their
      ready sympathy during her imprisonment was most pleasing to her.
    
    
      One day a little four-year-old child picked up a bunch of keys and carried
      them to her in the garden, saying:
    
    
      "I have brought you the keys now, so you need not always stay here. You
      can unlock the gates and go out whenever you please."
    
    
      Another child, the son of one of the soldiers, received so many tokens of
      reward from the royal prisoner in return for the bouquets he carried her,
      that he was, before long, suspected of acting as messenger between her and
      her fellow-prisoners, Courtenay and Lord Robert Dudley. Such may not have
      been the case; but the boy was prevented from again seeing the princess,
      and his father was severely reprimanded.
    
    
      Elizabeth could not have regarded Lord Robert Dudley in the light of a
      friend when she was sent to the Tower, because she knew that he had
      favored Lady Jane Grey's cause; therefore, the fact that he was in her
      good graces [068] a name="link068"
      id="link068">immediately upon her accession to the throne, proves that
      he must, in the interval, have found some means of seeking and obtaining
      her pardon. Whether or no notes and messages passed between them within
      the walls of the gloomy Tower can only be conjectured.
    
    
      At the expiration of a couple of months, Elizabeth was removed to
      Woodstock, where her life was less painful, though she was never allowed
      to forget that she was a prisoner under close surveillance. A band of
      armed men kept watch around the walls of the palace night and day, and she
      was allowed no visitors.
    
    
      She passed many hours at her needlework, and composed several pieces of
      poetry, which are scarcely worthy of being repeated. But her time hung
      heavily on her hands, and she was tortured by constant dread of her life
      being in danger. One day when sitting in her garden she heard a milkmaid
      merrily singing at her work, and said with a weary sigh: "Ah! her case is
      better, and her life is happier than mine; would I were a milkmaid, too!"
    
    
      With the hope of softening her sister's heart towards her, Elizabeth
      attended mass, went to confession, and, with the advice of Cardinal Pole,
      even proclaimed herself a Roman Catholic. She displayed a great deal of
      self-possession, when the queen, who still doubted her sincerity,
      notwithstanding her professions of religion, caused her to be questioned
      as to her opinion of a real Saviour in the sacrament of the Lord's Supper.
      She hesitated for only one moment, then replied in these extempore lines:       
    
    
      
    
    
      "Christ was the word that spake it;
    
    
      He took the bread and brake it,
    
    
      And what his word did make it,
    
    
      That I believe, and take it."
    
    
      
    
    
      Elizabeth's policy had the desired effect, and to her inexpressible
      delight she was invited to Hampton Court [069] a
      name="link069" id="link069">to spend the Christmas holidays with her
      sister, the queen. But a little disappointment awaited her on her arrival
      there; for much to her surprise she was still destined to be treated as a
      prisoner, and it was a whole fortnight before any notice was taken of her
      being at the palace, or before any one was admitted to visit her.
    
    
      A.D. 1555. She kept constantly wondering what
      this could mean, but had no opportunity of finding out. Quite unexpectedly
      one night she was summoned to the presence of the queen. Trembling with
      fear, and as to her fate, she was conducted by torchlight to the royal
      apartments. On entering she threw herself at Mary's feet and declared that
      she was a most true and loyal subject. In fact, she conducted herself
      throughout the interview in so submissive a manner, that at its close she
      was dismissed with tokens of affection and a beautiful ring. After that
      she was relieved of the presence of the guards and keepers and treated
      with marked respect by the principal personages of the realm.
    
    
      Although Philip, Mary's husband, could never quite forgive Elizabeth
      because she had refused to marry his friend, Philibert of Savoy, he was
      extremely kind to her, and did his part towards rendering the holidays a
      delightful season of enjoyment for her. At one of the grand pageants the
      young princess wore a rich white satin dress, embroidered all over in
      large pearls; and when she made her appearance in the hall, both Cardinal
      Pole and the king kneeled down and kissed her hand.
    
    
      A.D. 1556. The following autumn she went to live
      at Hatfield, where, surrounded by her old, attached friends, she
      established her household to her own liking. Her learned instructor, Roger
      Ascham, was one of the inmates, and under his guidance Elizabeth resumed
      her study of classical literature.
    
    
      A.D. 1557. [070] a
      name="link070" id="link070">In February the queen made her a visit,
      and was entertained in a sumptuous manner. There were daily amusements
      consisting of performances on the virginals, chorus singing, acting, and
      sumptuous banquets, as well as hunting parties, in which both the royal
      ladies took part.

      During the next summer the queen invited Elizabeth to an entertainment at
      Richmond. She was conveyed there in her majesty's own barge, which was
      richly decorated with garlands of artificial flowers, and covered with a
      green silk canopy embroidered in gold. Four ladies accompanied  span
      class="pagenum">[071]her, and
      six boats, containing her retinue, followed. The queen received her in a
      magnificent pavilion in her garden. This pavilion was made in the form of
      a castle and covered with purple velvet and cloth of gold, on which
      appeared the Spanish coat of arms, in honor of King Philip. A fine feast
      was served to the royal ladies, after which a number of minstrels
      performed. The next day Elizabeth returned to Hatfield, where she remained
      quietly until the following November, when Queen Mary died, and she was
      proclaimed her successor.
    
    
      A.D. 1558. Heralds, stationed at the grand door
      of Westminster Palace, as well as at other public places, announced the
      new sovereign with the sound of trumpets, while bells were rung, bonfires
      lighted, and ale and wine generously dealt out to the populace by the
      wealthy citizens.
    
    
      All exhibitions of mourning for the dead queen were quickly replaced by
      celebrations in honor of the living one, whose accession was regarded with
      the keenest interest by the whole nation.
    
    
      Elizabeth's first public act, after receiving the privy council, was to
      appoint her principal secretary of state. Her choice was Sir William
      Cecil, who not only proved himself a great statesman, but remained
      Elizabeth's staunch friend to the day of his death.
    
    
      On the twenty-eighth day of November the new queen entered the city of
      London, attended by a train of about a thousand nobles, knights,
      gentlemen, and ladies, and proceeded to the Charter-house. Next, in
      accordance with an ancient custom, she proceeded to the Tower. On that
      occasion the streets through which she passed were spread with fine
      gravel. The public buildings were hung with rich tapestry, and guns were
      fired at regular intervals. The queen was mounted on her palfry, richly
      attired in purple [072] a name="link072"
      id="link072">velvet: a vast concourse of people had gathered to greet
      her, and as she approached, preceded by her heralds and great officers,
      joyful shouts and acclamations filled the air, while she gracefully
      returned the salutations of even the humblest of her subjects.
    
    
      At various points the procession halted while the queen was welcomed with
      music, speeches, or a chorus of children. She seemed pleased with
      everything, replied to the addresses, noticed everybody, and frankly
      expressed her gratification at the honors that were showered upon her. Her
      early misfortunes had taught her a wholesome lesson, and in adversity she
      had learned the worth of Wordsworth's immortal words:       
    
    
      
    
    
      "Of friends, however humble, scorn not one."
    
    
      
    
    
      Attended by Lord Robert Dudley, who had already been appointed to the
      lofty position of master of the house, Elizabeth entered the Tower, once
      her dungeon, now her palace, and proceeded straight to her former prison
      apartment, where falling on her knees she offered up a loud, fervent
      prayer of thanksgiving.
    
    
      While passing through the court of the Tower she turned to those near her,
      and said: "Some have fallen from being princes in this land to be
      prisoners in this place; I am raised from being a prisoner in this place
      to be prince of this land, so I must bear myself thankful to God and
      merciful to men."
    
    
      After a few days in the Tower the queen went to Somerset House for a
      fortnight, and then to the palace of Westminster, where she spent
      Christmas.
    
    
      The next matter of importance that occupied Elizabeth's attention was her
      coronation, for which preparations were already going forward in London.
      It seems strange that so learned a woman as Queen Elizabeth should have
      been [073]superstitious,
      but such was indeed the case, and she scarcely ever took an important step
      without previously consulting Doctor Dee, the well-known conjuror.
    
    
      Consequently Robert Dudley was sent to request this humbug to appoint a
      lucky day for the coronation. After consulting the stars and other
      heavenly bodies he decided upon Sunday, January 15.
    
    
      All the favorite summer residences of the Tudor princes stood on the banks
      of the Thames. Therefore, as the streets of London were narrow and badly
      paved, it was the custom of the court to pass from one to the other by
      water. The nobility owned their own barges, and the rowers wore liveries
      distinguished by the crests and badges of their employers.
    
    
      Three days before the solemn and imposing coronation ceremony was to take
      place, a grand procession of boats was arranged for the purpose of
      conducting her majesty from Westminster to the royal apartments in the
      Tower.
    
    
      Rich tapestries, hangings of silk and velvet, gorgeously embroidered in
      gold and silver, hung from the balconies of the houses all along the
      route, while gay banners, pennons, and flags floated from the roofs. All
      the public and private barges were drawn forth in grand array, festooned
      with garlands of flowers and bright new flags. Bands of music accompanied
      the procession, and cannons were fired during its entire progress.
    
    
      On the 14th the queen's passage through the city took place. She appeared
      in a superb chariot, preceded by trumpeters and heralds in armor, and
      drawn by richly caparisoned horses. A retinue of lords and ladies followed
      on horseback, the latter wearing crimson velvet habits. The gentlemen wore
      gowns of velvet or satin richly trimmed with fur or gold lace, costly gold
      chains, and caps or hoods [074] a
      name="link074" id="link074">of material to match the gown, adorned
      with feathers and jewels.
    
    
      Elizabeth did not sit quietly back in her chariot as other sovereigns did;
      she kept constantly acting       making speeches, smiling, pressing her
      hand to her heart, and raising her eyes to heaven as occasion seemed to
      demand. This peculiar behavior delighted the populace, who showered their
      sovereign with nosegays and rent the air with shouts and cheers. Several
      times she stopped the procession to say a few pleasant words to some
      particularly poor-looking individual, and a branch of rosemary presented
      by a shabbily-dressed old woman occupied a prominent place in the royal
      chariot until its arrival at Westminster.
    
    
      By such trifling actions Elizabeth won the hearts of even the lowest of
      her subjects. It was her policy to please, and no woman was ever more
      perfect in the art. She listened with profound attention to the poems and
      speeches that accompanied the pageants arranged at different points along
      Cheapside, where every house was decorated and rich carpets covered the
      path. The pageants were similar to the triumphal arches of the present
      day. They were erected of wood, and had appropriate sentences in Latin and
      English inscribed upon them. At each one a child was stationed to explain
      to the queen in English verse the meaning of the device.
    
    
      One pageant represented an allegory of Time and Truth. "Who is that old
      man with the scythe and hour-glass?" asked Elizabeth. "Time," was the
      reply. "Time has brought me here," she returned. Truth held a Bible which,
      at the recital of a particular part of the verse, was let down by a silken
      cord into the queen's chariot. She received the volume with both hands,
      and reverently pressed it to her heart and lips, declaring in a loud tone
      that she thanked the city more for that gift than any other, and  span
      class="pagenum">[075]added that
      she would read it diligently. Equal attention was bestowed on the other
      pageants; and just as she passed through Temple Bar Elizabeth stood up,
      and, facing the crowd, exclaimed in farewell: "Be ye well assured, I will
      stand your good queen."
    
    
      The shouts that arose in response sounded above the report of the guns.
    
    
      Next morning the queen appeared at Westminster, attired in a mantle of
      crimson velvet, lined and trimmed with ermine and fastened with cords,
      tassels, and buttons of silk and gold. Her jacket and train were also of
      crimson velvet, and gold lace adorned her head-dress. She wore no jewels,
      and her coronation was remarkable for its simplicity. The Episcopal
      bishop, Oglethorpe, performed the ceremony, but he followed the Roman
      Catholic ritual without the slightest change. Though Elizabeth was a
      Protestant, she raised no objection to the Catholic service until the
      following Christmas, when just at the moment for making her offerings she
      arose abruptly, and, followed by her whole retinue, left the chapel. Had
      any objection been made to this proceeding she would have pleaded sudden
      illness, but finding it universally approved, she ordered the service to
      be for the future performed in English, which was never done in the
      Catholic church.
    
    
      The learned Doctor Parker was appointed Archbishop of Canterbury, and it
      was through his influence that the Church of England was established
      nearly in its present state.
    
    
      One of the queen's earliest acts was to send friendly messages to all the
      Protestant princes of Europe; at the same time she assured the pope that
      she would not interfere with the religious views of any of her subjects.
      Thus she hoped to conciliate both parties. As a rule, she was gracious to
      her former persecutors; but to one member of [076] a
      name="link076" id="link076">Queen Mary's household who had been
      impertinent to her, and who hastened to throw himself at her feet as soon
      as she was raised to power, she said: "Fear not; we are of the nature of
      the lion, and cannot descend to the destruction of mice and such small
      beasts."
    
    
      Queen Elizabeth made an enemy of Philip, her sister's widower, by refusing
      his hand when she was twenty-five years of age; but in doing so she
      announced her determination never to marry at all.
    
    
      Her popularity increased to such an extent that the lower classes idolized
      her, and the nobles and gentlemen of her realm were thirsting for an
      opportunity to risk their lives in her service.
    
    
      She appeared in public very frequently, and when her rowing parties took
      place crowds flocked to the river banks to welcome her with music and
      fireworks. When she went to Greenwich for the summer all sorts of
      exhibitions were planned to furnish an excuse for Londoners to flock
      there.
    
    
      Much of Elizabeth's popularity was due to the fact that she spared no
      pains to render the national holidays enjoyable to every class of her
      subjects. Though she, too, enjoyed the festivities with all the zest of a
      young, sprightly, healthy woman, her pleasure was not by any means
      unalloyed.
    
    
      One serious cause of anxiety was the knowledge that Henry II. of France
      was constantly trying to place his daughter-in-law, Mary Stuart, on the
      throne of England, and there was a powerful Catholic party who felt her
      claim to be a just one. But death soon put an end to the king's
      interference, and calmed Elizabeth's fears from that source.
    
    
      Then Mary Stuart's husband, Francis II., threatened to assert her rights;
      but he was too sickly and insignificant a [077] a
      name="link077" id="link077">person to take the stand his father had
      done, and death removed him also out of the way.
    
    
      So many suitors sought the young queen's hand that we are reminded of what
      Shakspeare says of Portia in "The Merchant of Venice": "While we shut the
      gate on a wooer, another knocks at the door."
    
    
      A.D 1559. Elizabeth coquetted with them,
      accepted their numerous and costly presents, made use of them to further
      her plans or carry some point with her council, but never with the
      slightest intention of marrying any one of them.
    
    
      When at last Philip II. married she pretended to feel dreadfully
      mortified, and told the Spanish ambassador "that his king was very
      inconstant, since he could not wait four short months to see whether she
      would change her mind."
    
    
      The person most favored by Queen Elizabeth at that time was Robert Dudley,
      who afterwards became Earl of Leicester, and much jealousy was aroused
      among the members of the council on account of it. Dudley was married to
      Amy Robsart, a beautiful and wealthy heiress, who never appeared at court.
      For some reason or other she resided in a solitary country mansion, where
      she died quite suddenly. It was given out that an accidental fall had
      caused it, but there were strong suspicions of murder, and Robert Dudley
      was not held entirely innocent of it. However, no inquiry was instituted,
      and the queen would hear no complaints of her favorite. She took occasion
      to remark publicly that as Dudley was at the palace when his wife died she
      was convinced of his innocence.
    
    
      A.D. 1560. In 1560 Mistress Montague, her
      majesty's silk woman, presented her with a pair of knitted silk stockings,
      which pleased her so much that she laid aside forever the cloth kind she
      had always worn. [078] a name="link078"
      id="link078">A decided change had taken place in the queen's wardrobe,
      for in her youth she was noted for the extreme simplicity of her attire;
      but no sooner did she ascend the throne than she gave full swing to her
      vanity, and purchased more finery than any Queen of England had ever done.
      She had three thousand dresses and eighty wigs of different styles and
      colors. She was positively loaded down with pearls, jewels, velvets, furs,
      and embroidery. Her costumes were neither pretty nor tasteful; for their
      object seemed to be nothing but a display of gaudy colors and showy
      jewelry.
    
    
      Elizabeth's court was conducted with great magnificence, and those whose
      duty it was to supply the royal household were often guilty of robbing and
      imposing upon the farmers. Complaints were made to her majesty, who always
      lent a willing ear to her subjects, and invariably compensated them for
      their loss. One day, when she was walking in the fields with her lords and
      ladies, a sturdy countryman placed himself in her path, and as she
      approached called out in a rude, coarse tone: "Which is the queen?" She
      turned towards him with an encouraging smile; he repeated the question,
      looking from one lady to another, until Elizabeth stepped forward and
      said: "I am thy queen; what wouldst thou have with me?"
    
    
      "You!" exclaimed the man with a look of surprise and admiration. "You are
      one of the rarest women I ever saw, and can eat no more than my daughter
      Madge, who is thought the finest lass in our parish, though short of you;
      but the Queen Elizabeth I look for devours so many of my hens, ducks, and
      capons that I am not able to live."
    
    
      Now Elizabeth was always indulgent to any one who paid her compliments,
      but upon inquiry she found this man to be both unjust and dishonest, so
      she had him severely punished.
    
    
      [079]
    
    
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Original
    
    
      [081]Among
      the preparations for Easter it was the queen's custom to wash the feet of
      twenty poor women, to each of whom she gave a new gown and the white cup
      from which she had drank to them. The same afternoon she appeared in St.
      James's Park and distributed two thousand silver coins, valued at eight
      pence each, among as many poor men, women, and children. These public acts
      of charity endeared the sovereign to her people, for they were always the
      occasion of a holiday, and gave the humblest citizens an opportunity of
      speaking to her. The coins thus bestowed were worn by the recipients as
      precious amulets, and handed down in their families as heirlooms in memory
      of the gracious queen.
    
    
      Nobody ever visited the palace on any errand whatsoever without being
      invited, according to his station in life, to partake of a meal at one of
      the tables. No wonder that Elizabeth was a popular sovereign, and that
      her's was called a "golden reign."
    
    
      In 1560, at great loss to her treasury, she called in all the base coin
      that Henry VIII. had caused to be made, and returned to every person the
      full value in new sterling silver and gold.
    
    
      A.D. 1561. Late in the summer of 1561 Elizabeth
      made a journey through her kingdom, and was received with public
      rejoicings and displays wherever she went. These progresses, as
      they were called, occurred several times during Elizabeth's reign, when
      she was magnificently entertained at the various mansions of the nobles
      whom she honored with her visit.
    
    
      Queen Elizabeth was so skilled in the art of ruling that she knew a
      country was never so sure of enjoying the blessing of peace as when
      prepared for war, so she took pains to provide her's with ample means of
      defence. She gave orders for gunpowder that had been purchased in other
      [082]countries
      to be manufactured in England. Engineers and arsenals were furnished for
      all the fortified towns along the coast and the Scottish borders; forts
      were built, garrisons increased, and the wages of sailors and soldiers
      doubled. So many ships-of-war were built, and the navy was increased to
      such an extent, that after a reign of four years England could command a
      fleet with twenty thousand men at arms. Strangers called Elizabeth "Queen
      of the Sea;" her own subjects proudly styled her the restorer of naval
      glory. [083]
    
    
      
    
    
    
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER IV.
    
    
      A.D. 1562.
    
    
      Queen Elizabeth
      either forgot her promise to the pope, that she would not interfere with
      the religion of her subjects, or she was unmindful of it, for many were
      persecuted on account of their adherence to Catholicism. All emblems and
      pictures of the Catholic church were abolished; and as the English artists
      were not permitted to copy the sacred subjects selected by the Spanish,
      Italian, and Flemish masters, pictorial art came to a standstill in
      England.
    
    
      It was not on account of religion that the Countess of Lenox, one of the
      queen's nearest relations, was arrested and thrown into prison. She was
      charged with treason and witchcraft: but the real offence was a secret
      correspondence with her niece, the Queen of Scots, whom Elizabeth hated.
      She made no secret of this hatred, and was heard to ask "how it was
      possible for her to love any one whose interest it was to see her dead."
      Nevertheless, she would never acknowledge Mary's right to the throne. The
      fact is, that each of these queens would lavish affectionate terms on the
      other if the interest or caprice of the moment demanded it; but each was
      jealous and suspicious of the other, and each hated the other in the
      inmost recesses of her heart. Elizabeth was often urged to appoint a
      successor in the event of her death, and if the name of Mary was mentioned
      on such an occasion it threw her into a transport of rage.
    
    
      [084]At
      last a meeting was planned between the two queens, with the hope of
      establishing a better state of feeling; but the defeat of her army in
      France under Warwick gave Elizabeth an excuse for postponing the
      interview. This defeat was a sore trial to the queen, and besides the
      plague had killed off a great number of the soldiers. They brought the
      disease home with them, and during the following year twenty thousand
      people died of it in London alone.
    
    
      A.D. 1563. Meanwhile Lady Lenox had been
      released from prison, and was secretly trying to make up a match between
      Mary Stuart and Lord Henry Darnley. It was Mary's desire to conciliate
      Queen Elizabeth just then, so she sent Sir James Melville to consult her
      about an offer of marriage to herself.
    
    
      While this ambassador was at court Queen Elizabeth appeared in a different
      costume each day, and was pleased when he said that he preferred the
      Italian style for her because it displayed her yellow curls to advantage.
    
    
      She asked him which was the more beautiful, she or Mary Stuart.
    
    
      "You are the handsomest queen in England," he replied, "and ours the
      handsomest queen in Scotland."
    
    
      "Which of us is the taller?" asked Elizabeth.
    
    
      "Our queen," said Melville.
    
    
      "Then she is over-tall," returned Elizabeth; "for I am neither too tall
      nor too short."
    
    
      She next asked how Queen Mary passed her time.
    
    
      "When I left Scotland, she had just come from a Highland hunt," answered
      the ambassador; "but when she has leisure, she reads, and sometimes plays
      on the lute and the virginals."
    
    
      "Does she play well?" asked Elizabeth.
    
    
      "Reasonably well for a queen," was the reply. [085] a
      name="link085" id="link085">Elizabeth had a love for flattery that
      could never be satisfied; the most fulsome compliments were always
      acceptable, and those who desired favors at her hands knew the importance
      of tickling her vanity. It made her unhappy to suspect that any one could
      think Mary Stuart, of all women, in any particular superior to herself. So
      on the evening after the interview with Lord Melville she managed to
      perform on the virginals, when she knew that he was within hearing. It had
      the desired effect; for the ambassador raised the drawing-room curtains to
      see who the player was, and delighted the heart of Elizabeth by assuring
      her that she was a much better musician than his queen.
    
    
      Fond as Elizabeth was of popularity she never permitted any one to
      interfere with her. Once when Leicester attempted to express an opinion
      contrary to her's regarding some state matter, she flew into a passion,
      and said: "I will have here but one mistress and no master."
    
    
      This so humiliated the favorite, who had been treated like a spoiled child
      for several years, that he absented himself from court as much as
      possible, and finally requested that he might be sent on a diplomatic
      mission to France. But Elizabeth would not comply. She told him that it
      would be no great honor to the King of France, were she to send him her
      groom; then turning to the French ambassador, who was present, she
      laughingly added, "I cannot live without seeing him every day; he is like
      my lap-dog: so soon as he is seen any where they say I am near at hand,
      and wherever I am seen he is expected."
    
    
      Elizabeth was generally kind and grateful to those who had treated her
      well in her youth; but her cruelty towards Doctor Heath, Archbishop of
      York, is an exception. The doctor had been of real service to her; but so
      determined was she to brook no opposition, that when he refused to  span
      class="pagenum">[086]acknowledge
      her supremacy over the church, she had him shut up in the Tower, and even
      put to torture, although he was eighty years of age at the time.
    
    
      Temper often got the better of this illustrious queen; and when such was
      the case she made coarse, rude speeches to her attendants as well as
      members of parliament, which she regretted in calmer moments.
    
    
      A.D. 1564. When parliament urged her to marry
      she answered, "That if they would attend to their own business she would
      perform her's." Such discourteous speeches won for her a reprimand, which
      put her in such a rage that she refused to give satisfaction upon any
      question that was laid before her. Later she made a conciliatory speech
      and said: "That her successor might perhaps be more wise and learned than
      she, but one more careful of the country's weal they could not have." She
      bade them "beware how they again tried their sovereign's patience as they
      had done."
    
    
      Dr. Dee, the conjuror, spent much time at court, and received many favors
      from the queen, who even condescended to visit him at his own house. He
      had a mirror in which he pretended to read the queen's destiny, and showed
      her his laboratory where he was concocting an elixir of life for her
      special use. Elizabeth believed in him, granted him her protection, and
      finally appointed him Chancellor of St. Paul's Cathedral. He spent many
      years at his foolish trickery, but it is certain that he produced no
      compound either for rejuvenating the queen or for prolonging her life.
    
    
      A.D. 1567. In 1567 Lord Darnley, who had become
      Queen Mary's husband, was mysteriously murdered. Lord Bothwell, who was
      known to be in love with Mary, was accused of the crime, in which there
      was strong grounds for suspicion that Mary herself assisted. Elizabeth
      took

      Original
    
    
      [089]pains
      to express no opinion about this matter; but she, no doubt, believed, as
      all Europe did, in Mary's guilt. She took it upon herself to announce to
      the Countess of Lenox the fearful catastrophe that had befallen her son,
      and did so in a considerate and sympathetic manner, which formed a
      contrast to her former cruelty.
    
    
      Bothwell was tried, but his guilt could not be proved, and three months
      after Lord Darnley's death he and Mary Stuart were married. This shameful
      conduct horrified the Scottish people, and they rose in arms against their
      queen.
    
    
      Within a month after the marriage Bothwell was obliged to fly for his
      life, and Mary was imprisoned in Lochleven Castle.
    
    
      Elizabeth may not have regretted the downfall of Mary Stuart; but when she
      heard of her being a captive, subject to insults and abuse from her own
      people, her heart was touched, and she interposed with the Scottish nobles
      in behalf of the unfortunate queen. Her appeal had some weight, but Mary
      was compelled to sign a deed of abdication in favor of her son.
    
    
      A.D. 1568. A year after Lord Darnley's death
      Mary made her escape to England, and sought Elizabeth's protection. She
      crossed the Frith of Solway in a fishing-boat, and was conducted to
      Carlisle, where, though treated with respect, she soon discovered that she
      was once more a prisoner.
    
    
      Elizabeth's treacherous behavior towards the erring, dethroned queen who
      had placed herself in her power was a crime that has left a foul stain on
      her memory. But she had to pay the penalty; for as most of the Roman
      Catholics in the British Isles regarded Mary as the rightful Queen of
      England, the realm was filled with plots, revolts, and secret
      confederacies that kept her mind constantly on the rack. Mary begged for
      permission to seek protection in some [090] a
      name="link090" id="link090">other country; but Elizabeth secretly
      enjoyed the humiliation of her enemy, and was too cautious to restore the
      liberty of one whom she had ill treated.
    
    
      Consequently the royal prisoner was removed to Bolton Castle, a gloomy
      fortress, where she was subjected to most cruel indignities. She was
      closely watched; and Elizabeth's ministers, particularly Burleigh and
      Leicester, reported every action that could be distorted into the
      appearance of treason. Any partisan of Mary's that could be attacked was
      speedily brought to trial, and scaffolds streamed with the innocent blood
      of many a victim. Elizabeth's popularity was on the wane, and her numerous
      acts of injustice, that laid low the heads of some of the noblest men and
      women of her realm, rendered her an object of hatred for the time being.
    
    
      A.D. 1570. She was thirty-seven years old when
      Catherine de Medicis proposed her marriage with Henry of Anjou, the French
      prince, who was twenty years younger than the English queen.
    
    
      Catherine was one of the worst women that ever lived, and knew that such a
      union would be perfectly ridiculous; but she was so anxious to secure the
      crown of the Tudors and Plantagenets for her son that she pretended
      sincere affection for Elizabeth, and was capable of any deception,
      intrigue, or even crime to gain her point. Elizabeth, on the other hand,
      had such an exalted opinion of her own perfections that she would
      acknowledge no obstacle to the union but religion. In reality, she was too
      sensible not to be conscious of the absurdity of uniting herself to a
      youth of seventeen, but kept the matter pending for many months for the
      purpose of gaining the good-will of France, and of thus preventing that
      country from taking steps against her in the affairs of Scotland and
      towards the release of Mary. [091] a
      name="link091" id="link091">Young Henry remained passive for a long
      time, counting on Elizabeth's caprice and insincerity for his own escape;
      but when the French ambassador informed him that she was disposed to
      consent to the alliance, he declared that he would not go to England
      unless he could be allowed the public profession of the Catholic religion.
      Of course, that could not be thought of; so, to spare herself the
      indignity of being jilted, Elizabeth announced her determination never to
      marry at all.
    
    
      Meanwhile the Duke of Norfolk united with others in forming a plot for the
      liberation of Queen Mary and the assassination of Elizabeth. It was
      discovered, and led to the imprisonment and torture of a large number of
      people. The queen declared that she would never release Mary, and ordered
      the execution of the duke. But parliament assured her "that she must lay
      the axe to the root of the evil, for she would have neither rest nor
      security while the Queen of Scots was in existence."
    
    
      "What!" she exclaimed, "Can I put to death the bird, that to escape the
      pursuit of the hawk, has fled to my feet for protection? Honor and
      conscience forbid!"
    
    
      A.D. 1572. Queen Elizabeth was making a visit at
      Kenilworth Castle in the summer of 1572, and enjoying the festivities
      prepared by Leicester, when news arrived of that most horrible, most
      atrocious massacre of St. Bartholomew in France. The tales of horror,
      related by those Huguenots who were fortunate enough to escape from the
      hands of their pitiless persecutors and seek shelter in England, aroused
      the indignation of the Britons to such a degree that they thirsted to take
      up arms against the blood-stained Charles IX.,       that midnight
      assassin of his own subjects.
    
    
      But the very people who most warmly condemned the treachery and cruelty of
      the French now clamored for the [092] a
      name="link092" id="link092">blood of Mary Stuart, in revenge for the
      slaughtered Protestants. Burleigh and Leicester terrified the queen with
      rumors of plots which had their origin with the royal captive, until she
      became convinced that her life was in peril.
    
    
      After leaving Kenilworth Castle, Elizabeth made her usual summer progress,
      and was sumptuously entertained in each county where she halted. She
      received presents ranging from the richest jewels to such useful articles
      as gloves, handkerchiefs, stockings, and even night-dresses, and
      night-caps. Sir Philip Sidney, the accomplished soldier and statesman,
      wrote a poem in honor of the queen, that he recited at one of the
      entertainments, and then presented her with a cambric frock, the sleeves
      and collar of which were worked in black silk, and edged with gold and
      silver lace, and an open worked ruff set with spangles.
    
    
      One day when the queen was in her barge near Greenwich a gun was
      discharged from a neighboring boat, the bullet passing through both arms
      of a rower who stood near her. Every one was shocked, but Elizabeth did
      not lose her presence of mind for an instant. Throwing her scarf to the
      man she bade him "to be of good cheer, for he should never want, for the
      bullet was meant for her though it had hit him." When the owner of the gun
      was examined he persisted that it had gone off by accident. The queen
      pardoned him, and said openly: "That she would never believe anything
      against her subjects that loving parents would not believe of their
      children."
    
    
      It was generally thought that Elizabeth was a woman of courage, but once;
      although she suffered agony from toothache for several days and nights,
      she would not submit to having the tooth extracted until the old Bishop of
      London consented to a similar operation in her presence.
    
    
      A.D. 1580. In 1580 officials were stationed, by
      the queen's orders, at the corners of the streets with shears in  span
      class="pagenum">[093]their hands
      to cut off any ruff that exceeded her's in size; they were, besides, to
      shorten the swords of all the gentlemen who wore longer ones than she had
      stipulated. The French ambassador protested, and insisted upon wearing his
      sword as long as he pleased. No doubt he thought his taste quite as good
      as the queen's,       particularly when he beheld her riding behind six
      light-gray Hungarian horses, with their manes and tails dyed deep-orange
      color.
    
    
      The same year Francis Drake returned from his voyage of discovery around
      the world. Elizabeth honored him with a visit on board his vessel, and
      knighted him for the courage, skill, and perseverance he had displayed.
    
    
      Much anxiety and alarm were felt in England about this time on account of
      political plots and rumors of conspiracies against the queen's life; and
      the Catholic subjects, most of whom were ready to raise the standard of
      revolt in the name of Mary Stuart, were treated with such severity that
      those who could escape sought homes in foreign lands. Many noblemen were
      executed or put to the torture. Ambassadors from France were entertained
      with all the splendor that the English court could produce, for the queen
      delighted in thus impressing foreign visitors; but whenever they ventured
      to intercede for the Queen of Scots, they were met with an uncontrollable
      outburst of rage.
    
    
      Since Elizabeth had decided to remain single she would not give her
      consent to the marriage of any lady or gentleman connected with her court.
      But Leicester had married again in spite of her, and had thus placed
      himself under a cloud. He excited the royal displeasure still further when
      he was acting as military commander in the Low countries, on account of
      the regal airs he assumed. He even went so far as to express his intention
      to hold a court that should rival in display that of England. On hearing
      of [094]it,
      Elizabeth not only forbade Leicester's wife to join him, but cut off his
      supplies of money, saying: "I will let the upstart know how easily the
      hand that has exalted him can beat him down to the dust."
    
    
      Sir Walter Raleigh had succeeded Leicester in Elizabeth's esteem, and of
      course excited the bitter jealousy of the deposed favorite. Raleigh was
      the younger son of a country gentleman of small fortune. He was a soldier,
      seaman, statesman, poet, philosopher, and wit. His grace and beauty
      rendered him particularly attractive to Elizabeth, who never could bear a
      homely person among her attendants. One day her majesty went out for a
      walk after a heavy rain; arriving at a muddy gutter she stopped to
      consider how to get across, when Sir-Walter, with courteous presence of
      mind, pulled off a handsome plush cloak that he wore for the first time,
      and spread it on the ground for the queen to walk over. She accepted the
      attention with pleasure, and rewarded the gentleman with several new
      cloaks in place of the one he had ruined for her sake.
    
    
      It is to Sir Walter Raleigh that England is indebted for her first
      possession in America, which, in compliment to his queen's unmarried
      state, he named Virginia; and it was he who introduced tobacco into
      England from the newly discovered coast.
    
    
      On one occasion he was enjoying the weed himself, when his servant entered
      with a tankard of ale. Seeing his master enveloped in smoke, that
      proceeded from his lips, the simple fellow supposed that some internal
      fire was destroying his vitals, so he dashed the contents of the tankard
      full into Sir Walter's face, and then ran down stairs to alarm the family
      before the smoker should be reduced to ashes.
    
    
      It was Raleigh who first presented the poet Spenser to the queen, and she
      was so charmed with his poetic genius that she gave him a thousand pounds.
      In return, he made

      Original
    
    
      [097]her
      the heroine of several poems, and personified her in three different
      characters in his celebrated work, entitled the "Faerie Queen."
    
    
      A.D. 1586. Another plot to assassinate the queen
      was laid at Mary Stuart's door, and the councillors repeated their demands
      for her execution. But Elizabeth shrank from appearing directly to bring
      an anointed sovereign to the block, though she did not hesitate to subject
      her to every species of quiet cruelty. Mary was kept in damp, unhealthy
      apartments, deprived of exercise, and on several occasions compelled to
      rise from a sick-bed to travel, in the depth of winter, from one prison to
      another. Her health became seriously impaired, but that had no effect on
      Elizabeth; and an insulting letter addressed to her by the royal prisoner
      did not tend to soften her heart.
    
    
      At last Mary was induced by spies, who pretended to-be her friends, to
      write to the French and Spanish ambassadors requesting aid from their
      governments. These letters were intercepted and shown to the queen. Many
      of Mary's partisans were arrested; and Walsingham, one of the ministers,
      published a full account of the preparations France and Spain were making
      to invade England       where, upon landing, their troops would be joined
      by all the papists of the realm.
    
    
      This excited the indignation of the populace to the utmost degree, and
      both foreign and native Catholics were in danger in consequence; even the
      ambassadors were insulted in their houses. Every heart now warmed towards
      the queen; and when the conspirators were discovered and locked up in the
      Tower, the event was celebrated by the lighting of bonfires and ringing of
      bells.
    
    
      At last it was decided that Mary Stuart should have a trial, if so perfect
      a farce merits that name. Elizabeth had said publicly that she considered
      the Scottish queen un- [098] a name="link098"
      id="link098">worthy of counsel, and that was in itself enough to
      condemn her without a trial.
    
    
      When the commissioners arrived at Fotheringay, and ordered Mary to appear
      before them, she refused to acknowledge their authority; but they were
      armed with a letter from Elizabeth, which she was compelled to obey.
    
    
      Mary's deportment in this trying emergency was spirited and adroit. She
      told the commissioners "that she had endeavored to gain her liberty, and
      would continue to do so as long as she lived; but that she had never
      plotted against the life of the queen."
    
    
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Original
    
    
      After pleading for herself for two days, Mary demanded to be heard before
      the parliament of England, or the queen herself and her council. The court
      was then adjourned, the whole proceeding reported to Elizabeth, and twelve
      days later sentence of death was pronounced on the Scottish  span
      class="pagenum">[099]queen. At
      the next meeting of parliament it was urged that the sentence should be
      carried into effect.
    
    
      At this period Elizabeth behaved with her characteristic selfishness. She
      was anxious for Mary's death, and felt no pity for the object of her fury;
      but she feared to appear before the world as the author of the revenge
      upon which she was bent, and sought to make parliament share the odium of
      her deed.
    
    
      The Kings of France and Scotland interceded for Mary and increased
      Elizabeth's irresolution; but Leicester and Walsingham, well knowing what
      their fate would be should Elizabeth chance to die, and thus make way for
      Mary to the throne of England, kept urging their sovereign to sign the
      death-warrant. At last she yielded; but no sooner had she done so than she
      fell into a state of melancholy, and secretly urged one of the castellans
      of Fotheringay to murder his hapless charge. She was willing to resort to
      any means of getting Mary out of the way, providing she could preserve her
      own reputation by putting the blame on others. But she was not to be
      gratified, and on the 8th of February the execution took place in due
      form. Not one of the council had the courage to inform the queen that the
      bloody deed was accomplished. In the evening she asked "what meant the
      bonfires and the merry ringing of the bells?" The answer stunned her for a
      moment; then she burst into a passionate fit of weeping, sharply rebuked
      her council and bade them quit her sight at once, saying that she had
      never commanded nor intended the execution of Mary Stuart.
    
    
      This may have been hypocrisy; but more likely it was remorse for a
      needless, outrageous, barbarous act.
    
    
      Elizabeth wrote to James VI. of Scotland, professing her innocence of the
      "miserable accident," as she was pleased to term the murder of his mother,
      and assuring [100] a name="link100"
      id="link100">him of her affection for himself. To the French
      ambassador she said that the death of her kinswoman was the greatest
      misfortune of her life, and that although she had signed the death-warrant
      to gratify her subjects, she had never meant to carry it into effect. She
      added that her council had played her a trick which would have cost them
      their heads, did she not believe that they had acted for the welfare of
      herself and the state. After Mary Stuart's death there seemed to be an end
      to conspiracies for a while, and no very important event occupied the
      queen's mind until she began to make preparations to defend herself
      against the invasion of the grand Spanish army, called the Invincible
      Armada. She showed herself on this occasion worthy to be the queen and
      heroine of a nation that were eager to prove their devotion and loyalty.
    
    
      A.D. 1588. The despised, disgraced Earl of
      Leicester, who had by this time regained his place in the royal favor, was
      appointed commander-in-chief of the army at Tilbury. Lord Hunsdon
      commanded the queen's body-guard for the defence of London, and Sir
      Francis Drake was appointed vice-admiral.
    
    
      Elizabeth took up her abode at Havering Bower, a place selected for her by
      Leicester, situated between the rear and van of her army. There she
      appeared as warrior and queen. Mounted on a noble charger, with a
      general's truncheon in her hand, a polished steel corselet over her
      magnificent apparel, and a page in attendance bearing her white plumed
      helmet, she rode bareheaded from rank to rank, addressing her soldiers
      with words of encouragement and hope. She was greeted with loud shouts of
      applause by her admiring subjects, who felt it an honor to fight for such
      a noble, courageous sovereign.
    
    
      The Spaniards had flattered themselves that with an army equipped as
      their's was it would require only one [101] a
      name="link101" id="link101">fight by sea and one on land to achieve
      the conquest of England; but they soon found their mistake, and not a
      single Spaniard set foot on English soil except as a prisoner.
    
    
      The Spanish Armada was soon scattered, and victory was declared for
      England.
    
    
      Immense crowds gathered to welcome the queen on her return to Westminster.
      She was then fifty-five years of age, at the height of her glory, and
      beloved by her subjects, whom she had ruled for thirty years, and who had
      united, one and all, Catholic and Protestant, to support her in
      vindicating the honor of England.
    
    
      Her first act was to reward her brave commanders and provide for the
      wounded seamen. Upon Leicester she would have bestowed the highest office
      ever held by an English subject,       that of lord-lieutenant of England
      and Ireland; but, much to the satisfaction of the other statesmen, he died
      before the patent could be made out. A series of thanksgivings were
      observed in London to commemorate the victory, and the queen was presented
      with a number of rich and valuable gifts.
    
    
      Queen Elizabeth was never an idle woman. Long before day, in winter, she
      transacted business with her Secretaries of state, heard public documents,
      and gave her orders concerning them. After breakfast she would promenade
      in her garden or the corridors of the palace, as the weather prompted,
      attended by some learned gentlemen of the court, with whom she discussed
      intellectual topics, and a portion of each day was devoted to study.
    
    
      She observed strictly all the fast-days prescribed by the church. She was
      a moderate eater, and seldom drank anything but beer; when she dined in
      public the table was magnificently spread, with a profusion of costly
      plate, for she was fond of displaying her riches, particularly before
      [102]foreign
      ambassadors. Her cup-bearer always served her on his knees, and music and
      singing accompanied the banquet.
    
    
      At supper, when the cares of the day were over, the queen would chat
      freely and pleasantly with her court, and the evenings were passed with
      chess-playing, music, or recitations and stories by the famous comedian,
      Tarleton, and others. She was fond of apes and dogs, but, beyond all, of
      children, with whom she loved to talk and amuse herself.
    
    
      As a rule, Elizabeth treated her attendants well; but when her temper got
      the upper hand, which was not seldom, she descended to the level of a
      common virago, and more than once struck some maid of honor for a trifling
      offence. But these outbursts of rage were reserved for the people of the
      palace; her other subjects witnessed only sweetness and good humor.
    
    
      Her impulses were good, as she proved in the case of Margaret Lambrun, a
      Scottish woman, whose husband was supposed to have died of grief because
      of the tragic fate of the Queen of Scots, in whose service he was.
      Margaret took the desperate resolution to avenge his death; so, disguised
      in male attire, she proceeded, with a concealed brace of pistols, to the
      English court, with the intention of killing the queen with one and
      herself with the other. One day, when her majesty was walking in the
      garden of the palace, Margaret made her way through the crowd so as to get
      near enough to make sure of her aim, but in her excitement she dropped one
      of the pistols. She was instantly seized, and would have been hurried away
      to prison but Elizabeth said "she would examine the young man herself."
    
    
      A.D. 1589. When brought before her Margaret
      bravely acknowledged who she was, her intended action, and its cause. The
      queen heard her patiently; then not

      Original
    
    
      [105]only
      granted her a full pardon, but provided her with an escort to France, as
      she had requested.
    
    
      Many persecutions on the score of religion succeeded the victory over the
      Spanish Armada, and one of the greatest grievances of Elizabeth's reign
      was known as the privy seal loans. Whenever an individual was known to
      have amassed a sum of money her majesty's ministers would borrow for the
      royal treasury. To be sure, they paid a liberal interest; but there was no
      security for the principal, besides the sovereign's promise to pay, which,
      it is easy to see, would have been valueless in the event of death.
    
    
      After the death of Leicester, Essex, who had been created Knight of the
      Garter, succeeded to the queen's favor; but while she was showing him the
      utmost consideration he excited her wrath by marrying the widow of Sir
      Philip Sidney, the illustrious soldier and statesman, who had been killed
      at the battle of Zutphen. He was at once replaced by Sir Robert Cecil, and
      when Henry III. sent to England for aid to defend himself against the
      Spanish invaders, he injured his cause by saying that Essex approved of
      his demand; for Elizabeth replied, "That the Earl of Essex would have it
      thought that he ruled the realm, but that nothing was more untrue; that
      she would make him the most pitiful fellow in the realm, and instead of
      sending the King of France more troops, she would recall all those she had
      already lent him." Having said this she haughtily swept out of the room,
      and would have nothing further to say to the ambassador.
    
    
      A.D. 1592. Later, when Essex showed prompt
      obedience at the queen's command for his return to England, she was so
      pleased that she entertained him with feasts, and sent him back to France
      honored with the highest distinction. Every request he made was granted
      almost before [106] a name="link106"
      id="link106">it was considered. Nevertheless, Elizabeth's capricious
      nature asserted itself when Ireland was in a state of revolt, and there
      was difficulty in finding some one to fill the post of lord-deputy over
      the distracted country. On that occasion Essex peremptorily insisted that
      Sir George Carew was the proper man for the office, whereupon, forgetting
      how by numerous indulgences she had encouraged him to speak freely,
      Elizabeth felt so offended at his positive tone that she lost her
      self-control, and giving him a sound box on the ear, bade him "go and be
      hanged."
    
    
      Essex was so indignant that he swore a horrible oath, and impertinently
      adding something about "a king in petticoats."
    
    
      Later the royal mind was changed again, and he was sent as lord-deputy to
      Ireland.
    
    
      While there, he was so unmindful of the queen's orders that he was accused
      of treason, and on his return shut up in the Tower. He had many enemies,
      and Cecil so prejudiced the queen and her court against him that he was
      condemned to die.
    
    
      A.D. 1601. Elizabeth hesitated as long as
      possible before signing his death-warrant. She had given Essex a ring when
      he was in favor, with the promise that if ever he offended her the sight
      of that token would insure forgiveness. The imprisoned statesman did send
      the ring by a boy who chanced to pass his prison window one morning; but
      by an unlucky accident it fell into the hands of the lord-admiral, a
      deadly foe of Essex, who said nothing about it. The queen concluding that
      her former favorite was too proud to sue for forgiveness, because the ring
      she had been expecting did not reach her, ordered the execution to
      proceed.
    
    
      The English nation could not forgive the death of the generous and gallant
      nobleman, and the queen was no

      received with cheers when she appeared in public. She did not fail to
      notice the change in her subject's feelings towards her, and this made her
      excessively unhappy. A deep depression took possession of her, and though
      she tried to appear gay her heart was very heavy. Several attempts were
      made on her life from time to time as she advanced in years, but
      fortunately each was frustrated.
    
    
      Literature made rapid strides during Queen Elizabeth's reign, particularly
      all that was written in Italian, which language her majesty understood
      well. Many dramatists rose to distinction at this period, the greatest
      being William Shakspeare. Spenser and Sir Philip Sidney added lustre to
      this reign also.
    
    
      Elizabeth's last parliament was summoned in the autumn of 1601. She
      performed the ceremony with more than her customary display; but she was
      in such feeble health as to be unable to support the weight of the royal
      robes, and she was actually sinking to the ground when a nobleman, who
      stood near, caught her and supported her in his arms. She rallied and went
      through the fatiguing ceremony with her usual dignity and grace.
    
    
      The science of medicine was in such a rude condition in the sixteenth
      century that the wealthy were treated with doses of pulverized jewels or
      gold. The poor had the best of it; for they were obliged to depend on
      herbs and ointments which certainly must have been more efficacious.
    
    
      Queen Elizabeth had so little confidence in doctors or their prescriptions
      that she could not be induced to consult them even when she was very ill.
    
    
      A.D. 1603. Her last sickness began in March,
      1603, and when she was urged to seek medical aid, she angrily replied:
      "That she knew her own constitution better than anybody else, and that she
      was not in such danger as they imagined." She grew worse, however, and
      died two weeks [110] a name="link110"
      id="link110">later, in the seventieth year of her age, and the
      forty-fourth of her reign.
    
    
      She was buried in Westminster Abbey in the same grave with her sister.
      Mary Tudor. Her successor, James I., erected a monument to her memory. On
      a slab of pure white marble the effigy of this remarkable queen lies
      beneath a stately canopy. Her head rests on embroidered cushions, her feet
      on a couchant lion. Royal robes hang around her form in classic folds, and
      her closely curled hair is covered with a simple cap. She has no crown,
      the sceptre has been broken from one hand, also the cross from the
      imperial orb which she holds in the other.
    
    
      That learned English philosopher, Lord Bacon, has written of Queen
      Elizabeth: "She was pious, moderate, constant, and an enemy to novelty.
      She hated vice, and studied to preserve an honorable name. No age has ever
      produced her like for the government of a kingdom."

      CHAPTER V.
    
    
      ANNE OF DENMARK, QUEEN-CONSORT OF JAMES THE FIRST.
    
    
      (A.D. 1575-1618.)
    
    
      Anne of Denmark was
      certainly less intellectual than some of her predecessors, and on many
      occasions showed herself wanting in judgment and common sense; but her
      political position was of immense importance, because she was the wife of
      the first monarch who ruled over the whole of the British isles. The
      Orkney and Shetland islands had fallen into the hands of the Danish King
      during the preceding century, and were yielded to James VI. of Scotland on
      condition of his marrying the Princess Anne.
    
    
      These islands were of value because of their geographical position; for
      they had become the rendezvous of pirates, who found them convenient
      headquarters whence their raids could be made along the British coast.
    
    
      Princess Anne's parents were Frederic II. of Denmark, one of the richest
      princes of Europe, and Sophia, a woman loved and admired for her domestic
      virtues. These royal parents had such luxurious ideas about the rearing of
      their children that although Anne was a strong, healthy child, well-formed
      in every respect, she was never permitted to walk until she was nine years
      of age.
    
    
      A.D 1585. Negotiations for her marriage began
      when she was ten; and then it was thought proper to teach her to sew,
      read, and dance, before she could be regarded as an accomplished maid.
      [114]James
      VI. was born at Edinburgh Castle, but the poor little unfortunate was
      early deprived of parental care; for while he was yet a baby his father,
      Lord Darnley, was killed, and his luckless mother, Mary Stuart, was forced
      to seek refuge in England.
    
    
      At the early age of fourteen months James was proclaimed King of Scotland.
      On that occasion the Earl of Marr, his guardian, carried the infant in
      procession and placed him on the throne; another peer held the crown above
      his head, while a third placed the globe and sceptre in his little hands,
      and Lord Marr repeated the necessary oath in the name of the little one,
      who was then carried back to his nursery.
    
    
      Of course little James was only king in name, for many years would have to
      pass before he would be fit to undertake the reins of government.
      Meanwhile, his uncle, the Earl of Murray, was appointed to act as regent.
      Unfortunately for the young king, he had a nurse who was by no means
      capable of taking charge of him, for she drank to excess and never
      controlled him or his diet properly. The consequence was that he developed
      slowly, and was such a weakling that he was full five years old before he
      could walk, and throughout his life his limbs were never as strong as they
      ought to have been. This defect may have been partly due, however, to the
      absurd manner of dressing infants three centuries ago in Scotland; for as
      soon as they were born they were swathed in bandages, with their arms
      bound down to their side and their legs close together and straight out,
      precisely after the manner of an Egyptian mummy. Is it any wonder that
      they were long in discovering the use of their limbs? In some parts of
      Germany babies are subjected to this cruel swaddling to the present day,
      but the arms are left free, and fortunately the custom is gradually going
      out of favor.
    
    
      [115]
    
    
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Original
    
    
      [117]Though
      backward in the use of his legs, little James talked wonderfully well, and
      soon learned to ask questions that were difficult to answer, and to make
      remarks that often seemed most profound for one of his age
    
    
      A.D. 1571. He was just four years when he was
      called upon to perform regal duty by convening parliament. The Earl of
      Marr carried him to the grand Gothic hall of Stirling Castle, and placed
      him on the throne. He seemed impressed at the numerous assemblage of lords
      and gentlemen, but looked around as though to familiarize himself with the
      scene, and when the proper time came recited the speech that had been
      drilled into him beforehand. But he added a little impromptu speech of his
      own, for his eyes rested on a hole in the canopy above the throne, and he
      exclaimed aloud in his childish voice: "There is ane hole in this
      parliament." In the present day such a remark from the lips of a little
      boy might excite a smile, but certainly no great importance would be
      attached to it, but in the year 1571 the Scotch were very superstitious,
      and so they gazed at the infant monarch with amazement. "What could he
      possibly mean?" asked the wise lords of one another; for they never for
      one moment doubted that the spirit of prophesy had prompted the remark,
      and that the king foresaw an awful decrease in their numbers to be made by
      death.
    
    
      In the course of the year the Earl of Lenox, James's grandfather, was
      killed, and that justified the royal child's remark in the eyes of the
      superstitious. The old earl was on his way to visit James, when he was
      stabbed in the back by conspirators. The brave Earl of Marr, attracted by
      the dying man's groans, rushed out from Stirling Castle with his servants
      and carried him to a place of safety. "Is the babe attacked?" asked the
      old man, and on being assured that he alone was the sufferer, he replied,
      with a sigh of [118] a name="link118"
      id="link118">relief, "Then all is well," and died soon after with
      perfect resignation.
    
    
      The Earl of Marr was tutor to the king until he died, when he was
      succeeded by George Buchanan, a bad, morose, capricious man, who had such
      rigid ideas with regard to discipline that old Lady Marr, the earl's
      mother, often wept on account of his cruel treatment towards his pupil.
    
    
      James had been removed to Stirling Castle during his infancy, and there he
      passed his youth. His favorite companion was Thomas Erskine, his
      foster-brother, who happened to be born on the same day as the young king,
      whose cradle and sports he shared. Another playmate was the young Earl of
      Marr, for whom James formed an attachment so warm and true that it lasted
      to the end of his life.
    
    
      A.D. 1577. The civil and religious wars that
      were raging in Scotland had their effect on the young king, and, to some
      extent, appear to have injured his character; for he was, in consequence,
      under the control of some people whose influence was bad, and prompted him
      to authoritative manners that were out of place in one so young, and made
      him appear in a false light.
    
    
      As he grew older he would at times pretend to be an imbecile, merely from
      a spirit of perversity; but he was neither a fool nor a coward, as he
      proved later.
    
    
      He was only sixteen years of age when the Earl of Gowrie captured him, but
      he managed to make his escape and seek the protection of his great-uncle,
      the Earl of March. A revolution succeeded, and Gowrie was beheaded soon
      after.
    
    
      A.D. 1580. Three years later, Frederic II. of
      Denmark sent ambassadors to Scotland to offer to the young king the hand
      of his second daughter in marriage. Queen [119] a
      name="link119" id="link119">Elizabeth opposed this alliance so
      violently that the marriage-treaty was delayed several years. She ought to
      have been pleased at the prospect of a Protestant wife for the future King
      of England, but it was her peculiarity to break off every match that she
      could influence.
    
    
      Meanwhile, Henry of Navarre offered his sister Catherine for a wife to
      James; but as she was many years older than the young king, and as Anne of
      Denmark was just sixteen, and a miniature that had been sent to Scotland
      represented her as being very beautiful, the decision was quickly made in
      her favor.
    
    
      Before the necessary arrangements could be completed her father, King
      Frederic, died.
    
    
      A.D. 1589. The Earl-marischal of Scotland,
      accompanied by other dignitaries, proceeded, as proxies for James, with a
      noble fleet, to claim the young princess and carry her to Scotland. They
      were received with great joy by Queen Sophia, who, with Princess Anne, met
      them at the fortress of Corenburg. There the bride embarked on board a
      ship commanded by the Danish admiral, Peter Munch, who, with a fleet of
      eleven other fine ships, set sail for Scotland. It was in the month of
      September, and the sea was so rough that although the squadron sighted
      land in due season contrary winds blew them to the coast of Norway.
      Instead of attributing this occurrence to natural causes, Peter Munch was
      in a dreadful state of perplexity, and began to consider what witches he
      had offended to such an extent as to induce them to raise the winds and
      waves so that he could not bring the young queen to Scotland. Suddenly it
      occurred to him that he had boxed the ears of an officer at Copenhagen,
      whose wife was a well-known witch. He felt satisfied then that in order to
      avenge the insult to her husband the witch-wife had tampered with the
      winds, and so the unfortunate creature was burnt alive when he got back
      home. [120]Having
      once determined that they were bewitched, nothing went well with the
      fleet, and a series of disasters reduced ten of the ships to such a
      deplorable condition that they returned to Denmark. The one in which the
      queen had sailed took refuge in a harbor on the coast of Norway, where, as
      the cold weather had already set in, there was every prospect that the
      bride would have to stay all the winter. She wrote an account of her
      sufferings to the King of Scotland, which a young Dane undertook to
      deliver in spite of witches and weather.
    
    
      While expecting his wife King James had made grand preparations for her
      reception, and he was so disappointed at her delay that he resolved to go
      himself to fetch her. Now this was a brave undertaking, for the best ship
      that could be furnished was a miserable bark, scarcely fit to brave the
      wintry storms of the German ocean; however, a prosperous breeze favored
      the courageous king until he approached the Norwegian coast. He had
      enjoyed four days of fine weather, but on the fifth a furious tempest
      sprang up, and for twenty-four hours the royal bark was in danger of
      wreck. At last she ran into a little harbor, where King James landed.
    
    
      After several days' travelling through snow and ice, he reached the
      village where Anne had established herself, and without waiting for the
      ceremonies of his rank and station, he left his attendants and marched
      straight to the presence of his bride. On the following Sunday they were
      married, and the king immediately, and very thoughtfully, sent a messenger
      over the mountains to Denmark to inform Queen Sophia of his arrival and
      marriage with the princess.
    
    
      Her majesty then invited the newly-wedded pair to make her a visit. They
      consented, and set out upon a journey beset with so many hardships that
      they were obliged to [121] a name="link121"
      id="link121">halt several times before they reached the Castle of
      Croenburg, where all the royal family of Denmark had assembled to meet
      them.
    
    
      All was gayety and splendor at the rich court, where the marriage of James
      and Anne was celebrated over again according to the Lutheran rites.
      Nothing interfered with their pleasure, excepting the quarrelsome spirit
      of the Scottish nobles who had accompanied the king. They all drank too
      freely, his majesty included, and there were frequent brawls and strifes
      among them.
    
    
      It was not until after the wedding of Queen Anne's sister Elizabeth to the
      Duke of Brunswick, which took place early in the spring, that the Scottish
      bride and groom thought of proceeding to their future home.
    
    
      The royal family of Denmark entertained such a warm affection for one
      another that when the moment of parting arrived it was a sore trial for
      the young queen to bid farewell to her loving mother, as well as to the
      young king, her brother, who was so fond of her that in later years he
      paid several long visits at her court.
    
    
      The royal fleet sailed from Croenburg in April, and when the bridal pair
      landed a large crowd of faithful subjects assembled to welcome them to
      Scotland.
    
    
      Shortly after, preparations for the queen's coronation were begun. On the
      Tuesday preceding that ceremony her majesty made her state-entry into the
      city of Edinburgh, riding in a richly gilt car, lined with crimson velvet;
      on either side of her sat her favorite Danish maids of honor. The king
      rode on horseback just in front of the queen's carriage, and a train of
      robles escorted the royal couple to Holyrood. The coronation ceremony was
      performed on the following Sunday at the Abbey church of Holyrood.
    
    
      On the following Tuesday, accompanied by the king and [122] a
      name="link122" id="link122">all the lords and ladies who had assisted
      at her coronation, the queen passed through the streets of Edinburgh in an
      open coach.
    
    
      At the end of a month passed in all sorts of festivities and rejoicings,
      the Danish visitors returned home, and Queen Anne went to live at
      Dunfermline Palace, which had been renovated and refurnished to suit her
      taste.
    
    
      As the young queen's knowledge of household arrangements was necessarily
      limited, and as she was inexperienced concerning the customs of her new
      country, the king advised her always to consult his faithful friend and
      loyal subject, Sir James Melville, who held a high position in the royal
      household.
    
    
      With the perversity that she showed on many occasions throughout her reign
      Queen Anne immediately took a decided aversion to Melville, and never in
      any emergency sought his advice.
    
    
      There had been no queen at the Scottish court for a quarter of a century,
      consequently the men surrounding it had become so course and brutal in
      their manners that it was necessary to make many changes, and even to
      dismiss some of the most faithful officials before ladies could feel safe
      or comfortable.
    
    
      A.D. 1590. Among the reformations that were
      taking place in Scotland, the destruction of all the works of art in the
      churches were deemed necessary; but no steps were taken to abolish the
      horrible superstition that led to the burning of hecatombs of witches.
      More than half the time of the judges was occupied with their absurd
      confessions. One of the most remarkable of these witches was Annis
      Simpson, called by her neighbors "the wise wife of Keith." She declared
      that she had a familiar spirit, who appeared in a visible form at her
      call, and informed her whether people who were ill or exposed to danger
      should

      Original
    
    
      [125]live
      or die. The king asked her what words she used to summon the spirit. She
      replied: "That she merely called ''Holla, master!' and he came without
      fail." Then she proceeded to describe one of the witch meetings which, she
      said, was held at night in a church, where the devil in a long black gown,
      with a hat on his head, preached from the pulpit to an audience of
      witches. She added, furthermore, that one man got his ears boxed by the
      preacher because he thanked God that no harm had come to the king, though
      many had been injured. Thereupon the devil solemnly pronounced this
      sentence: "Il est un homme de Dieu." This was the more firmly
      credited because the woman did not understand what the words meant;
      therefore, it was argued, she could not have invented them. James was
      immensely flattered at being called a man of God by the evil spirit.
    
    
      "The wise wife of Keith" was first strangled, and then burned in company
      with others whom she had accused.
    
    
      A.D. 1592. One summer when Queen Anne was
      visiting at her palace of Falkland, Bothwell, a relation of the earl who
      was Mary Stuart's husband, made a furious attack on it. He was repulsed,
      but entered the stables and carried off all the horses. The queen was so
      annoyed at this rude adventure that she removed at once to Dalkeith.
      Margaret Twineslace, one of the Danish maids of honor, was engaged to be
      married to John Wemys, one of the king's gentlemen, who was known to be in
      constant communication with Bothwell. He was, therefore, suspected of
      knowing, at least, that the attack on Falkland was to take place, though
      there was no proof of his having participated. Still he was shut up in the
      guard-room of Dalkeith Castle, and every one thought his life was in
      danger.
    
    
      One night, when it was Margaret's turn to sleep in the queen's
      bed-chamber, she waited until the royal pair were [126] a
      name="link126" id="link126">in the land of Nod, then softly stole out
      and went to her lover's prison, where she told the guard that the king had
      sent her to command them to lead John Wemys forthwith to the queen's
      apartment, where his majesty wished to question him. Never, for a moment,
      suspecting that they were deceived, two sentinels led the prisoner to the
      queen's chamber door. Margaret then charged them to remain outside
      quietly, and taking her lover by the hand, led him boldly into the room
      and closed the door. Without speaking a word she softly opened the window,
      and, presenting John with a rope, helped him to let himself down and
      escape.
    
    
      The guard waited patiently until morning dawned, then raised the alarm,
      which led to the discovery of the little trick. The queen laughed heartily
      when she heard how Wemys had escaped, and begged the king to pardon him.
    
    
      James himself was amused at the adventure, and issued a proclamation
      offering pardon to the escaped prisoner if he would return to his duties.
      This he did within a few days, and soon after married the Danish
      maid-of-honor who had risked so much for his sake.
    
    
      A.D. 1594. In 1594 Queen Anne had a little son
      born at Stirling Castle. He was baptized according to the Episcopal ritual
      of Scotland, and named Henry-Frederic. The ceremony was conducted with
      great pomp, and after it was over the queen received all the foreign
      ambassadors. They brought costly presents, and Queen Elizabeth sent a set
      of silver and several cups of massive gold, so heavy that Sir James
      Melville declared he could hardly lift them.
    
    
      The young queen loved her little son so tenderly that when she found it
      was her husband's intention to leave him at Stirling Castle to be cared
      for by the Earl of Marr and the old countess, his mother, she was sorely
      grieved [127]and
      begged that she might keep the child with her. But the king refused,
      saying, "that he knew the infant was in safe keeping with Marr, and though
      he doubted nothing of her good intentions, yet if some faction got strong
      enough she could not hinder his boy from being used against him, as he
      himself had been against his unfortunate mother."
    
    
      No doubt Anne ought to have been satisfied to make a virtue of necessity;
      but she could not understand any argument but that of her own heart, which
      prompted her to rebel against the Marrs because they had possession of her
      darling, A.D. 1595. She fretted and wept until
      the king was beside himself to know what was best to do. When little Henry
      was fifteen months old his mother requested that the question of his
      guardianship might be settled by council; but James was too shrewd to
      submit to that proceeding, so he urged the queen to satisfy the craving of
      her heart by going at once to Stirling Castle. But that was not what her
      majesty desired; therefore, she declared that she was not well, and
      refused to stir. James insisted, and obliged his wife to obey by
      superintending the arrangements for the journey and turning a deaf ear to
      all her objections. Finding that there was no help for it, Queen Anne set
      out on horseback with her train of attendants; but with her usual
      perversity she feigned illness, and stopped at a palace by the way. She
      was anxious to see her baby, no doubt, but could not bear that her husband
      should find her too yielding; so, on every occasion when he deemed it
      necessary to oppose her, she made him suffer for it. Yet James VI. was a
      devoted husband throughout his life, and never took a firm stand against
      his wife unless urgent reasons required it.
    
    
      As soon as the Earl of Marr was informed of the queen's whereabouts he
      hastened to pay his respects to her; but [128] a
      name="link128" id="link128">she absolutely refused to see him, and her
      people treated him so uncivilly that he was glad to return to Stirling
      Castle. It was foolish in Queen Anne to insult her husband's most faithful
      friend and the man who had charge of her infant, but that was not the
      extent of her folly.
    
    
      During the king's absence on his summer travels she actually went so far
      as to plan an expedition, which she meant to head, for the purpose of
      carrying off the infant prince by force. Fortunately, James heard of it in
      time to reach the place where his wife was stopping and bring her back to
      her senses. He at once accompanied her to Stirling Castle, where she was
      permitted to fondle little Henry as much as she pleased.
    
    
      It was not unnatural that Queen Anne should want to keep her child with
      her; but she showed decided want of character in insisting upon it after
      the king had explained to her that the safety of his own person, the
      child, and the kingdom required this sacrifice at her hands. Had she taken
      pains to inform herself she would have seen that all the misfortunes of
      the preceding kings of the line of Stuart had arisen on account of their
      having been minors at the time of their accession. The throne had in each
      case been claimed for the son, which necessitated the destruction of the
      father and the appointment of a regent. Thus the strongest party had ruled
      according to their own ideas of justice.
    
    
      It was to prevent the recurrence of such a miserable state of affairs that
      King James fortified his son in a well-guarded castle, under the
      supervision of such tried friends and loyal subjects as the Earl of Marr
      and his mother.
    
    
      A.D. 1596. Anne's outbursts of temper because of
      this arrangement were for a time appeased, when her second child was born.
      It was a girl, and received the name of Elizabeth for the Queen of
      England. The infant princess [129] a
      name="link129" id="link129">was given in charge of Lord and Lady
      Livingstone, though the ministers of the Episcopal Church objected on the
      score of the latter's adherence to Catholicism. This child afterwards
      became Queen of Bohemia.
    
    
      There were two people among Queen Anne's court who occupied a very
      prominent position, and were specially favored with her protection. These
      were Alexander and Beatrice Ruthven, members of a family in Scotland who
      claimed royal descent. The Ruthven family had attained the earldom of
      Gowry, and its members had aided in three separate assaults on the
      personal liberty of the sovereign; they were, therefore, the cause of a
      great deal of fighting and bloodshed.
    
    
      A.D. 1597. Young Alexander became the object of
      King James's jealousy on one occasion. It occurred in this wise: "One day,
      when the queen was walking in the gardens of Falkland Palace with Beatrice
      Ruthven, they suddenly came upon the maid-of-honor's brother, Alexander, a
      youth of nineteen, who lay fast asleep beneath the shade of a large tree.
      For a bit of fun her majesty tied a silver ribbon around his neck, which
      had been given to her by the king, without arousing the sleeper. Presently
      King James himself came along. The silver ribbon caught his attention, he
      stooped to examine it, frowned, and looked angrily on the youth, who was,
      by the way, a gentleman-of-the-bed-chamber, then hurried on without waking
      young Ruthven. Beatrice, who had been anxiously watching this little scene
      from behind a neighboring bush, rushed forward, snatched the ribbon from
      her brother's neck, and hastened with it through a private entrance to the
      queen's room. Hurriedly opening a drawer, she deposited the ribbon
      therein, and had just time to inform her majesty 'that her reason for so
      doing would be presently explained,' when the king entered, and in a
      threatening tone demanded [130] a
      name="link130" id="link130">the silver ribbon. Luckily Anne was able
      to produce it, and thus dispel the angry frown that had gathered on the
      brow of her lord, no doubt congratulating herself upon the possession of
      so sagacious a maid-of-honor."
    
    
      For the time being King James's jealousy was appeased; but the Gowry
      conspiracy aroused it again three years later, and Alexander Ruthven was
      again the object of it.
    
    
      A.D. 1600. The queen was awakened much earlier
      than usual one bright, warm morning in August by the king's preparations
      for a hunting expedition. She asked "why he started so early;" to which he
      replied, "that he wished to be astir betimes, as he expected to kill a
      prime buck before noon."
    
    
      It was true that he was going hunting, but he had another object in view.
      He had been informed by Alexander Ruthven that a Jesuit with a large bag
      of gold had just been seized and shut up at Gowry House, in Perth,
      awaiting examination. It was no unusual occurrence at that era for any one
      besides a common robber to take possession of whatever gold might be found
      on the person of a traveller, and then spare no effort to prove said
      traveller Jesuitical. So King James set forth in high glee with the
      prospect of counting over a bag of gold, besides enjoying a morning hunt.
      Several hours were passed in the latter diversion; and at noon,
      accompanied by only one or two attendants, the king left the woods and
      entered Gowry House. He was received by the Earl of Gowry, young Ruthven's
      elder brother, who had just returned from the court of Queen Elizabeth.
      After dinner, at a sign from Alexander Ruthven, the king withdrew,
      expecting to be introduced to the Jesuit with the gold. Unsuspectingly he
      followed the young man up various winding stairs and through gloomy,
      intricate passages to a circular room, [131] a
      name="link131" id="link131">used by the Go wry family as a prison. He
      was surprised, on entering, to behold a gigantic man in a complete suit of
      black armor, and still more so when Alexander closed the door and locked
      it, cutting off all retreat.
    
    
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Original
    
    
      He then made an assault upon the king,       who, though unarmed, kept him
      at bay,       and reproached him with the death of his father, the Earl of
      Gowry. The man in armor took no part in the struggle. The king
      remonstrated with Alexander, and reminded him that he was a child when the
      late Earl of Gowry was beheaded, and had nothing whatever to do with it.
      He also spoke of the affection the queen bore to his sister Beatrice, and
      of the kindness and attention he himself had received at court. Young
      Ruthven paused [132] a name="link132"
      id="link132">for a moment, then made a second attack upon the king,
      who would surely have been murdered but for the vigilance of his page,
      young Ramsay. This youth missed his royal master, and, suspecting some
      evil, sought him through the house. The king's voice, calling for help,
      guided the boy's steps to the circular chamber, which he entered through a
      private door, having forced it open. He flew at Alexander Ruthven and
      dragged him from the king's throat, shouting all the time for help. Some
      of the Gowry servants rushed upon the scene and assisted Ramsay, who was
      struggling with Alexander Ruthven. At this juncture the rest of the royal
      hunting party arrived, and broke open the door, but not until the Earl of
      Gowry, who proved to be the man in armor, and young Ruthven were slain.
    
    
      A.D. 1601. This conspiracy created great
      consternation in Scotland. It was a dark, gloomy night when the king set
      out with his retinue to return to Falkland Palace; but all the people
      swarmed out of their houses with torches, and shouted with joy to behold
      their sovereign safe from the hands of traitors.
    
    
      In 1601 a little prince was born at Dunfermline, who later became Charles
      I. of England.
    
    
      A.D. 1603. A couple of years after this event
      Queen Elizabeth died, and King James was invited to come to London, and
      take possession of the crown under the title of James I.
    
    
      Of course this was no surprise; it was an exaltation that had been eagerly
      anticipated by the royal family as well as the whole nation. Yet when the
      moment arrived for the king to bid farewell to his Scottish subjects, it
      was very like a father parting from a numerous family, and many tears were
      shed. On the Sunday before his departure from England a sermon was
      preached on the subject in church, to which King James responded, bidding
      his people a loving and tender farewell. [133] a
      name="link133" id="link133">He went to England alone, having arranged
      that the queen should follow in twenty days, providing his reception was
      such as to assure him that his family would be safe and happy. On his
      arrival there he was greeted with such wild demonstrations of joy that he
      was perfectly astonished. "These people will spoil a good king," was his
      pithy remark to the Earl of Marr, who had accompanied him.
    
    
      No sooner was Queen Anne convinced that her son's guardian was well out of
      the way, than she set off for Stirling Castle, accompanied by a strong
      body of nobles, never doubting that she could easily intimidate the
      Countess of Marr into the surrender of her son Henry. But the old lady
      proved herself equal to the emergency, and flatly refused to give up the
      boy unless ordered to do so by the king himself. Some fighting ensued, and
      the queen flew into such a tremendous passion that she became seriously
      ill, and had to be put to bed in the royal apartments of the castle.
    
    
      Messengers were forthwith despatched to inform the king of the condition
      of his silly, spoiled wife, and of the action that had occasioned her
      illness. With his usual forbearance, James forgave his spouse, and thought
      only of her illness. He immediately sent the Duke of Lenox and the Earl of
      Marr to see what arrangements they could make to pacify her majesty.
    
    
      The royal lady not only refused to see Marr, but would not receive her son
      from his hands, nor travel from Stirling to Edinburgh if he were of the
      company,       so thoroughly did she hate one of her husband's most loyal
      adherents.
    
    
      When this whim was conveyed to James, he swore a great many oaths, and
      wrote a letter of remonstrance to his better half, which, however, did not
      mollify her in the least. Then the royal husband compromised by ordering
      Marr to deliver the young prince to the Duke of Lenox,  span
      class="pagenum">[134]who would
      consign him with due ceremony to the queen, and then to hasten to England,
      where his presence was greatly needed.
    
    
      This arrangement pacified Anne, and she removed at once to Holyrood to
      make preparations for leaving Scotland. These were completed in a couple
      of months.
    
    
      Her majesty was met at Berwick by the ladies of Queen Elizabeth's court,
      who carried her the costumes and jewels of the defunct queen.
    
    
      King James ordered that the queen's household should be settled before her
      entrance into London, so that she might be properly escorted on that
      occasion. But the royal pair could not agree as to the appointments, for
      Anne desired to retain her Scottish subjects in the principal posts of
      honor, and his majesty knew that the English would not submit to that
      arrangement.
    
    
      He appointed Sir George Carew for the queen's chamberlain. Her majesty
      persisted in retaining Kennedy; whereupon James, whose patience had been
      sorely tried by the number of applicants who had presented themselves for
      confirmation, flew into a passion when Kennedy appeared before him. He
      bade him "Begone!" and added "that if he caught him carrying the
      chamberlain's staff before his wife he should take it out of his hand and
      break it over his pate."
    
    
      The Scotchman very prudently made the best of his way back home, and then
      Queen Anne accepted the English chamberlain, but retained all her Scottish
      ladies, adding to their number only two of her new subjects.
    
    
      Her two elder children accompanied her, and they were enthusiastically
      received everywhere. Among the presents that were generously bestowed on
      them were silver cups filled with gold-pieces. When they arrived at
      Althorpe an exquisite fête, prepared by Ben Jonson, awaited them.
      [135]It
      was called the Masque of the Fairies, and took place in a magnificent
      park, where, accompanied by joyful music, fairies and satyrs recited
      appropriate poems of welcome, and made presents to the royal family.
    
    
      The queen was so delighted with Ben Jonson's genius that she afterwards
      employed him to prepare entertainments for the amusement of her court.
    
    
      The first festival held at Windsor Castle after the arrival of the royal
      family was for the purpose of bestowing the title of Knight of the Garter
      on Prince Henry, the Duke of Lenox, and other nobles.
    
    
      The queen openly expressed her pride and admiration of Prince Henry when
      he was presented to her in the robes of the Garter, which she pronounced
      exceedingly becoming.
    
    
      In consequence of the plague, which was raging to an alarming extent in
      England, the coronation was postponed from time to time, and when it did
      take place the usual procession from the Tower through the city to
      Westminster was dispensed with, and the ceremony was performed almost in
      private. The people were so disappointed that a grand festival was
      promised to them as soon as the pestilence should abate. It took place
      with great splendor the following spring, when the king, queen, and Prince
      Henry participated.
    
    
      In the household of Anne of Denmark there was an office filled by an old
      lady called "the mother-of-the-maids," whose duty it was to keep order
      among the ladies,       no doubt an exceedingly difficult one.
    
    
      The belle of the court was Lady Arabella Stuart, whose descent made her
      the next heir to the crown of England after James I. and his family.
      Previous to the arrival of James there had been a plot, headed by Sir
      Walter Raleigh, formed for the purpose of asserting that lady's claim; but
      that fact did not make any impression on the [136] a
      name="link136" id="link136">sovereign's mind that could affect her
      unfavorably; on the contrary, he distinguished her with marked favors, and
      allowed her, as she deserved, the rank of first lady at court after the
      queen.
    
    
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Original
    
    
      The conspirators of this plot were brought to trial during the autumn
      while the court was sojourning at Winchester Palace, and many of them were
      pardoned just at the moment when they were being led to the scaffold. King
      James did this to make them appreciate the full extent of his mercy,
      though many of them were banished afterwards. Sir Walter Raleigh was shut
      up in the Tower, with his sentence hanging over his head, to be carried
      into effect at the royal pleasure. He was not, however, deprived of his
      income or his actual property, because the queen interested herself in his
      behalf, and felt very sorry on account [137] a
      name="link137" id="link137">of the cruel treatment he had received
      from the attorney-general during his trial. It was supposed by some people
      that she, as well as Prince Henry, doubted his guilt, but there is no
      proof of that.
    
    
      A.D. 1604. When Prince Charles was between three
      and four years of age his health was so bad that Sir Robert Carey and his
      wife, who had charge of the royal child, were ordered to bring him from
      Dunfermline to his parents. From that time he improved so rapidly that he
      soon became a robust boy; and as years went by, and he developed into
      manhood, he was distinguished for his graceful bearing and splendid
      constitution.
    
    
      A.D. 1610. One of the proudest and happiest
      periods of Queen Anne's life was when her eldest son was created Prince of
      Wales. The event was celebrated with great splendor, and Ben Jonson wrote
      an address in verse, which was read, while a pantomime represented the
      prince as wakening and reviving the dying genius of chivalry.
    
    
      The royal parents, the Princess and Prince Charles stood at the bridge by
      Westminster Palace to receive the prince when he arrived, escorted down
      the Thames in state by the lord-mayor and city authorities.
    
    
      The gratified mother conducted him into the palace. A number of festivals
      succeeded, and the king introduced his son formally to the assembled
      houses of parliament during the following week.
    
    
      A grand masque was given, in which all the ladies and gentlemen of the
      court took part, the music, painting, dancing, and decorations being
      guided and arranged by Inigo Jones, an architect of great talent. Even the
      queen and the princess-royal took part, and devoted several days to
      rehearsing the dances and situations and preparing costumes.
    
    
      The object of this masque was to deliver presents to [138] a
      name="link138" id="link138">the newly-created Prince of Wales. The
      court ladies personated nymphs of the principal rivers that belonged to
      the estates of their husbands or fathers, and eight of the handsomest
      nobleman attended these river nymphs as Tritons.
    
    
      Prince Charles appeared with a dozen young ladies of his own age and size.
      They were daughters of lords or barons, and personated the naiads of
      springs and fountains.
    
    
      The prince, as Zephyr, wore a short robe of green satin, embroidered in
      gold; silver wings were attached to his shoulders, and a garland of
      flowers encircled his brow; on his right arm, which was bare, the queen
      had clasped a valuable diamond bracelet.
    
    
      The naiads wore pale blue-satin tunics, embroidered in silver; their hair
      hung in loose tresses, and water-lilies crowned their heads. These
      children danced a ballet,       Prince Charles always occupying the centre
      of a group,       which was enthusiastically applauded by the whole court.
    
    
      Prince Charles's next duty was to offer to his brother, the Prince of
      Wales, the queen's present, which consisted of a jewelled sword, valued at
      four thousand pounds, attached to a scarf of her majesty's own work. He
      also presented a gold trident to the king as ruler of the ocean. This
      presentation was made during an address by one of the Tritons.
    
    
      Her majesty was then invited to descend from the throne and dance her
      ballet with her water-nymphs. This was succeeded by another dance of the
      little naiads, and the entertainment concluded with the queen's quadrille.
      The summer morning had dawned when the gay party dispersed.
    
    
      A.D. 1612. Two years later the Prince of Wales,
      that youth of eighteen, who was the joy of his parents and the  span
      class="pagenum">[139]pride of
      the whole nation, was attacked with the worst and most malignant form of
      typhus fever, which resulted in his death on the 5th of November, 1612.
    
    
      It was the anniversary of the Gunpowder Plot, and the procession of
      grotesque figures presented a strange contrast, as they swarmed around St.
      James's Palace, to the sad scene that was enacted within. When at last
      young Henry's death was announced, loud lamentations filled the air, and
      those who had left their homes to mingle with the festivities of the day
      returned bowed down with grief.
    
    
      It was many months before the poor queen recovered from the shock produced
      by the death of her dearly-beloved boy, and she was still so depressed
      when the marriage of her daughter was solemnized that she was scarcely fit
      to be present. However, she aroused herself for that occasion; but the
      reaction was so great after the departure of the princess from England
      that she was ordered to Bath by her physicians. The change proved of great
      benefit, and by the end of the summer her majesty had regained her health
      and spirits.
    
    
      Sometimes she shot at the deer from a stand. On one occasion she missed
      her aim, and hit the king's favorite hound. No one dared to announce the
      dreadful accident to his majesty, but he discovered the dead animal, and
      stormed so outrageously that it was many minutes before he could be
      informed whose hand had sent the deadly arrow. He was instantaneously
      mollified, and not only sent his beloved spouse a most affectionate
      message, but followed it with a jewel worth two thousand pounds,
      pretending it was a legacy to her from his dear, dead dog.
    
    
      A.D. 1614. A visit from her brother, the King of
      Denmark, gave the queen a great deal of pleasure. His sole object in going
      to England was to see her, whom he [140] a
      name="link140" id="link140">loved very dearly. He travelled incognito,
      and although one of the queen's attendants recognized him after his
      arrival at the palace, and told his sister of his presence, she would not
      believe it until he stole up behind her chair and gave her a kiss. The
      king, who was travelling through the country, was summoned home forthwith
      to receive his royal guest, and on his return there was a fortnight of
      hunting, bear-baiting, hawking, plays, and feasts. Just before his
      departure the King of Denmark entertained the English court at his own
      expense with the finest display of fireworks that had ever been witnessed
      in their country. After this visit Queen Anne never saw her brother again,
      though she corresponded with him until her death.
    
    
      It was while King James was on a visit to his native land, where he went
      for the purpose of establishing parish schools, that his wife's health
      began to fail. Three years previously her physicians had treated her for
      dropsy, from which she had never entirely recovered, and now a dreadful
      cough was added to the other malady. She was hastily removed to Hampton
      Court, where she was tenderly cared for. After his return, the king went
      to visit his wife two or three times a week, when he was well enough to do
      so, but his health was by no means good, for he had gout in his knees.
    
    
      A.D. 1618. About this time the poor sick queen
      received a most touching appeal from Sir Walter Raleigh, whose
      death-sentence was about to be carried into effect. It was written in
      verse, and ended thus:       
    
    
      
    
    
      "Save him who would have died for your defence!
    
    
      Save him whose thoughts no treason ever tainted."
    
    
      
    
    
      Queen Anne interceded for Sir Walter in vain, though she asked as a
      personal favor that his life might be spared,

      Original
    
    
      [143]for
      he was beheaded on the 29th of October, 1618. It is not reported how her
      majesty bore the news of Sir Walter's death; but her own was so near at
      hand that she probably viewed all affairs of this world with calmness and
      resignation, and turned her thoughts to the future state.
    
    
      King James was not with his wife during her last moments, but Prince
      Charles kneeled at her bedside and received her dying blessing. She was
      conscious to the end, and when the Bishop of London prayed, he said:
      "Madame, make a sign that your majesty is one with your God, and long to
      be with him." She held up her hands, and when one failed she raised the
      other until both dropped, and she was no more.
    
    
      The royal corpse was taken to Somerset House, where it lay in state for
      three days, and was then carried to the grave by ten knights, followed by
      most of the nobility then sojourning in London. The Countess of Arundel
      was chief lady mourner, and walked between the Duke of Lenox and the
      Marquis of Hamilton. All the ladies of the royal household came after, and
      as each one was enveloped in from twelve to sixteen yards of heavy black
      cloth, it was difficult for them to walk even at a funeral gait. Prince
      Charles preceded the funeral car, which was drawn by six horses, and the
      Archbishop of Canterbury walked by his side. The queen's riding horse was
      led by one of the officers of her household, and half a dozen heralds
      carried banners and flags bound with crepe just behind the pall.
    
    
      Queen Anne of Denmark died in the forty-sixth year of her age, and was
      buried at Westminster Abbey. She left two children, one who became Charles
      I. of England, and the other was Elizabeth, Queen of Bohemia.  span

      CHAPTER VI. HENRIETTA MARIA, QUEEN-CONSORT OF CHARLES I., KING OF GREAT
      BRITAIN AND IRELAND
    
    
      (A.D 1609-1669.)
    
    
      Henrietta Maria,
      wife of Charles I., was the youngest child of Henry IV. of France, and his
      second wife, Marie de Medicis.
    
    
      A.D. 1609. She was born at Louvre in 1609, and
      Madame de Monglat, the royal governess, took charge of her, as she had
      done of all her brothers and sisters from the time of their births.
    
    
      This princess had a grand baptism, no less a person than the pope's nuncio
      acting as sponsor. The name given to her was Henrietta Marie, but it
      became anglicized when she was so young that we must speak of her as she
      was known during the greater and more important part of her existence.
    
    
      She was unfortunate in having a mother who was so weak-minded, petulant,
      and bigoted as to be quite incapable of instilling into her children the
      wise principles that they needed to fit them for the battle of life.
    
    
      The little Henrietta was but six months old when her father was killed by
      Ravaillac; and her first appearance in public was made on the occasion of
      his funeral. She was carried in the arms of Madame de Monglat in the
      doleful procession, and her baby hands sprinkled the murdered
    
    
      [145]
    
    
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Original
    
    
      [147]corpse
      with holy water, according to the national custom in Normandy.
    
    
      The coronation of Louis XIII. followed close upon his father's
      assassination; but in consequence of his extreme youth his mother was
      appointed queen-regent, and civil war never ceased to rage in France while
      she continued in power.
    
    
      The royal children were kept at Fontainebleau, safe from the disturbances
      that were going on in Paris. It was the beautiful daughter of Madame de
      Monglat who superintended the toilet and daily life of little Henrietta,
      and the child loved her so dearly that she called her Mamanga, an Italian
      pet name, meaning mamma, and learned from the lips of Marie de Medicis,
      who was a native of Italy.
    
    
      The religious education of the little princess was guided by a Carmelite
      nun, whom she visited at stated intervals during her childhood. She and
      her little brother, Duke Gaston, who studied together, were taught music,
      painting, and some of the lighter branches, but were never put to any
      solid work; and later in life Henrietta often lamented her slight
      knowledge of history, saying that all her lessons of human character were
      learned from her own sad experience. She was a beautiful child, very much
      spoiled and flattered, and frequently summoned from the nursery to appear
      at public entertainments. When she was but six years old her mother took
      her to Bordeaux to witness the departure of her eldest sister, Elizabeth,
      to become the wife of the King of Spain, and the arrival of Anne of
      Austria, the Spanish bride of Louis XIII.
    
    
      About six years after her husband's death, France had become so desolated
      by the civil wars brought on by unwise government, that the queen-regent
      was imprisoned at the Castle of Blois, and the boy king of France assumed
      the power. [148]Princess
      Henrietta shared her mother's imprisonment for three years. At the
      expiration of that time she was present at the marriage of her sister
      Christine to the Duke of Savoy, and this event was succeeded by a
      reconciliation between Marie de Medicis and the young king. This was
      brought about by her almoner, who afterwards became Cardinal Richelieu,
      and thenceforward her influence in the government of France was greater
      than ever.
    
    
      A.D. 1625. When the Princess Henrietta was
      sixteen years old James I. sent Lord Kensington to France on a secret
      mission to find out whether her hand could be obtained for his son
      Charles, who had by that time become the most elegant and accomplished
      prince in Europe.
    
    
      The queen-mother was delighted with the prospects of such a match for her
      daughter, but would give no decided answer until the girl herself had been
      consulted.
    
    
      It was not long before every one at the French court knew the object of
      Kensington's visit, and the ladies crowded around the handsome Englishman
      to question him about the Prince of Wales, and to examine the miniature of
      the royal gentleman, which the ambassador wore suspended from a ribbon
      around his neck.
    
    
      Etiquette forbade the princess even to mention her royal suitor, much less
      to look at the picture she was dying to behold. But, remembering that the
      lady at whose house the ambassador sojourned had been in her service,
      Henrietta went to her and begged her to borrow the miniature, that she
      might feast her eyes on it as long as she pleased. This was done, and the
      young lady blushingly gazed upon the face of her future husband, and
      expressed her entire satisfaction with his appearance.
    
    
      Kensington lost no time in reporting her little stratagem; it was his
      intention to promote the alliance between Prince Charles and Princess
      Henrietta, so he expatiated on the

      Original
    
    
      [151]beauty,
      graces, and accomplishments of the former to the ladies of the French
      court, and wrote to England about the princess: "She is the sweetest
      creature in France and the loveliest thing in nature. Her growth is little
      short of her age, and her wisdom infinitely beyond it. She dances as well
      as I ever saw any one; she has a wonderful voice, and sings admirably."
    
    
      When it was ascertained that the marriage would be agreeable to both royal
      families, the Earl of Carlisle joined Kensington for the purpose of
      preparing the treaty.
    
    
      Then the pope raised an objection on the score of religion; for he did not
      believe the Catholic princess could be happy with a Protestant, husband in
      a country where her co-religionists had been persecuted.
    
    
      However, the queen mother had set her heart on the marriage; so after a
      great deal of debate it was agreed that Henrietta and all her attendants
      should be made welcome, and should have liberty to observe their religion
      in England; that she should renounce all claim to the French throne, and
      that her children should be brought up under her care until their
      thirteenth year.
    
    
      A.D. 1625. As soon as the treaty was signed King
      James ordered all persons imprisoned for religion to be released, fines
      levied against Catholics to be returned, and the execution of convicted
      papists to be stopped. This was the origin of all the opposition of the
      English parliament to the Stuart monarchs.
    
    
      King James died before the marriage took place. The ceremony was performed
      at Notre Dame, a prince of the house of Guise representing the royal
      groom. The Duke of Buckingham, with a splendid train of English nobles,
      met the bridal party at the church door, in order to escort the young
      Queen of England home.
    
    
      The whole court and royal family of France prepared to  span
      class="pagenum">[152]accompany
      the bride to the coast in magnificent style; but at the last moment Louis
      XIII. was prevented by illness from travelling, and the entire retinue
      were detained for two weeks at Compeigne by a dangerous malady which
      attacked Marie de Medicis.
    
    
      Charles I. was at Canterbury when his bride arrived in England, but he
      hastened to Dover to meet her as soon as the tidings were brought him. She
      was at breakfast when he was announced, but arose promptly and ran down
      stairs to meet him. She would have knelt and kissed his hand, but he drew
      her towards him and pressed her in his arms. Then the bride attempted to
      recite a little speech that she had prepared, but her courage failed, and
      she burst into tears. Charles treated her very kindly, drew her gently
      aside, and soothed her with loving and tender expressions.
    
    
      The weeping girl was soon reassured, her dark eyes brightened, and she
      conversed freely with her royal lover. Then she presented all her French
      attendants by name,       "Mamanga," now Madame St. George, being the
      principal of her ladies.
    
    
      The royal party left Dover the same day, and stopped at Canterbury, where
      all the English ladies of the queen's household were assembled to be
      presented to their royal mistress. It was in the open air on a June
      morning that Henrietta held her first court. The king assisted her to
      alight from her carriage, and after the presentation a magnificent feast
      was served.
    
    
      The royal pair entered London by the river Thames, hundreds of beautiful
      barges forming a procession, which was greeted by thundering salutes from
      the navy. That evening the bells rang till midnight, bonfires blazed on
      every side, and rejoicing was kept up for several days.
    
    
      King Charles opened his parliament with his bride seated beside him on the
      throne, and soon after retired for

      Original
    
    
      [155]several
      weeks to Hampton Court, because the plague was raging so dreadfully in
      London.
    
    
      The young queen was very attractive at this time. She was of medium
      height, but possessed a beautiful figure, her complexion was fine, face
      oval, eyes large, dark, and sparkling. Her hair was black, her teeth
      handsome, her forehead, nose, and mouth large, but well-formed.
    
    
      The king loved his little wife devotedly, and gave her the pet name of
      Mary,       a very unpopular one to English lads; but Charles declared
      that his people would soon forget their prejudice against it for the sake
      of the blessings the present bearer of it would bring them.
    
    
      Before many months the French attendants became objects of jealousy and
      dislike to the king, and notwithstanding the agreement that formed part of
      the marriage treaty he determined to get rid of them. Not only was it
      objectionable to the king that his wife should have mass celebrated in the
      palace, but his own attendants found fault with this arrangement, and
      Father Sancy, the queen's confessor, made himself obnoxious by insisting
      upon the establishment of a Roman Catholic chapel. Besides, Henrietta was
      so thoroughly under the influence of her French household that King
      Charles feared she would never become attached to him or his country. He
      thoroughly disliked Madame St. George, who was always thrusting herself
      forward, and interfering between him and his wife; but the most serious
      cause of displeasure that Charles I. had against the French attendants was
      that they influenced the queen in her refusal to share his coronation.
    
    
      This was an unpardonable piece of ignorance and bigotry, injurious to the
      king and dangerous to herself; for it was charged against her in later
      years that she had never been recognized as the consort of Charles I.
    
    
      A.D. 1626. The king was therefore crowned at
      West- [156]minster
      Abbey alone, his young and lovely wife refusing even to be present at the
      ceremony. This obstinacy was a death-blow to her popularity, and increased
      the difficulties that surrounded her husband. The Duke of Buckingham, who
      was in Paris, was notified that the French attendants would be sent home,
      and the king wrote a letter to his brother-in-law, Louis XIII., in
      justification of the proceedings.
    
    
      One day King Charles entered his wife's apartment at Whitehall, and found
      her attendants dancing about, and behaving in a manner that he considered
      disrespectful to the queen, so taking her quietly by the hand, he led her
      into a side room and closed the door. Presently an order was received
      bidding her majesty's French servants, young and old, to repair at once to
      Somerset House, there to await the king's orders. The women wept and
      lamented as though they had been summoned to execution; but the guard
      cleared them all out of the queen's apartments and bolted the doors after
      them.
    
    
      Meanwhile a stormy scene was being enacted between the royal couple.
      Henrietta flew into a rage when her husband told her what he had done, and
      rushed to the window to bid farewell to her train. The king drew her away,
      telling her "to be satisfied, for it must be so." Then she broke the panes
      with her fist, and his majesty was obliged to hold her wrists until her
      temper abated.
    
    
      She was not permitted to see her country-people again, excepting her
      nurse, her dresser, and Madame de la Tremouille,       those three being
      retained in her service.
    
    
      In a few days the king repaired to Somerset House, and in a set speech
      informed the French household of the necessity of dismissing them to their
      own country, and promised them their wages with gratuities to the amount
      of twenty-two thousand pounds. [157] a
      name="link157" id="link157">These people had robbed the queen to such
      an extent that she was actually left without a change of linen, and had,
      besides, contracted debts in her name.
    
    
      It was not until the following month, when the king sent a body of stout
      yeomen to turn the late attendants out of Somerset House by the shoulders,
      if they would not go otherwise, that they finally departed.
    
    
      The royal couple had been married just one year when all the French
      attendants, including Father Sancy, returned to their native land.
    
    
      The queen attributed her husband's turning off her household so summarily
      to the influence and advice of Buckingham, whom she disliked thoroughly.
    
    
      She became so restless and unhappy that she wanted to go back to France,
      and wrote her mother to that effect, repeating the grievances of which the
      banished household had already given an exaggerated account.
    
    
      The Duke de Bassompierre, a man of sense and spirit, and an old friend of
      Henry IV., was sent to England to inquire into the wrongs of which
      Henrietta complained. He found her dreadfully incensed against Buckingham,
      the prime minister, with whom she had had a violent quarrel, though she
      knew scarcely any English, and he very little French. Nevertheless he
      managed to make her comprehend him when he told her "to beware how she
      behaved, for in England queens had had their heads cut off before now."
    
    
      Henrietta assured de Bassompierre that the prime minister was constantly
      making mischief between her and her husband, because he was jealous of her
      influence.
    
    
      Bassompierre had several private interviews with the young queen, the
      king, and Buckingham, which resulted in a complete reconciliation. But her
      majesty was displeased because her father's old friend neither flattered
      nor spoiled [158] a name="link158"
      id="link158">her, and so she fell out with him, and by the expiration
      of a fortnight the reconciled parties were more angry with each other than
      ever before.
    
    
      The new subject of quarrel was the king's refusal to permit more than
      three chaplains for the performance of the Catholic service in the palace.
      Henrietta was too young to reason sensibly about her husband's affairs,
      and she was such a fervent Catholic that she could bear no opposition
      concerning her religion from her Protestant husband. Her position was an
      exceedingly difficult one, and all the errors she committed were the
      result of her youth and inexperience.
    
    
      The French ambassador had to begin his work all over again; and so
      adroitly did he manage, that in the course of a few days he had arranged
      all the disputed points. It was agreed that the queen should have two
      chapels built for her, one at St. James's, the other at Somerset House.
    
    
      A bishop, ten priests, a confessor, and ten musicians were to be
      furnished, as well as ladies of the bed-chamber, a clear-starcher, two
      physicians, an apothecary, a surgeon, a grand-chamberlain, a squire, a
      secretary, a gentleman-usher, a valet, and a baker, all from her majesty's
      native land.
    
    
      Even then the queen was not satisfied. She continued to play the vixen to
      such an extent that, regardless of her rank, Bassoinpierre took it upon
      himself to administer a bit of plain language. She had been flattered into
      believing that all her little tyrannies were quite becoming to a pretty
      queen, but she was now told that she behaved unlike a true wife, and that
      her conduct should be reported to her family in France.
    
    
      Henrietta was surprised at this honest dealing; but the effect was
      wholesome, and secured for her nearly eighteen years of happiness with her
      husband. [159]Instead
      of being received with honors on his return to France, de Bassompierre was
      frowned upon because he had avoided extreme measures in his capacity of
      mediator, and because he had spoken the truth too plainly.
    
    
      Shortly after a war broke out between England and France; but it did not
      in the least disturb Queen Henrietta's tranquillity, for she and her
      husband were never on better terms.
    
    
      But the French nation despised Charles I., and considered his wife a
      martyr and a victim. This led to the belief in an imposture of a crazy
      girl, who, calling herself the persecuted Queen of England, presented
      herself at a convent in Limoges, and claimed the protection of the nuns.
      She declared that she had escaped from England because she was persecuted
      on account of the true faith. She described the court and household of the
      queen so correctly that she was eagerly listened to by the whole
      neighborhood, who flocked to see her. Louis XIII., who knew how happily
      and peacefully his sister was then living, was so incensed at this
      imposition that he had the girl imprisoned, and she was heard of no more.
    
    
      A.D. 1628. The sudden death of Buckingham
      occurred when Henrietta was just eighteen years old, and she was thus rid
      of a person who had never ceased to be an object of dislike to her.
    
    
      Queen Henrietta had a great fancy for dwarfs; so, at an entertainment
      given to her once when she was making a progress through her
      kingdom, an immense venison pasty was placed in the centre of the table.
      The crust was removed and Geoffrey Hudson, a little man just eighteen
      inches high, stepped out, prostrated himself before her majesty, and asked
      to be taken into her service. His request was immediately complied with,
      and he was employed to carry state messages of slight importance. He was
      not [160]the
      only dwarf at courts for there was a married pair of these little monsters
      besides.
    
    
      A.D. 1630. The queen had a son born at St.
      James's Palace in 1630, who succeeded to the throne as Charles II.
    
    
      A Welsh nurse was provided for the royal infant, because it was the custom
      that the first words uttered by any Prince of Wales should be Welsh.
    
    
      He could not have been a handsome child, for his mother wrote of him to
      her friend, Madame St. George: "He is so ugly that I am ashamed of him;
      but his size and fatness supply the want of beauty."
    
    
      A.D. 1632. The royal family was increased by the
      birth of a daughter a couple of years later. She was named Mary, baptized,
      as her brother had been, according to the form prescribed in the Book of
      Common Prayer, and placed under the care of Catherine, Lady Stanhope.
    
    
      Henrietta's unpopularity was increased to an alarming degree on account of
      her laying the corner-stone of a Capuchin chapel, in the courtyard of
      Somerset House. She had already commenced one at St. James's; and when the
      Roman Catholic service was celebrated in them, about two years later, it
      was most injurious to the prosperity of the king, although it had been
      agreed that these chapels should be built. Henrietta refused to take part
      in her husband's coronation in Scotland as she had done in England,
      consequently he went alone.
    
    
      A.D. 1633 On his return another prince was added
      to the family, and baptized James. His title was the Duke of York. He was
      a handsome baby, and his father destined him for the navy. Henrietta was a
      fond mother, and devoted much of her time to the nursery. Etiquette
      prevented a queen from entertaining guests with her voice, but its
      magnificent strains often filled the galleries of the palace when she sang
      to her infants.
    
    
      A.D. 1638. [161] a

      displeasure of Cardinal Richelieu by offering a home in England to Marie
      de Medicis. This cardinal owed much of his grandeur to the queen-mother of
      France, but when she was in distress he turned his back on her.
    
    
      A.D. 1641. Marie de Medicis prolonged her stay
      in England nearly three years. During that period she witnessed the riots
      and disturbances that led to the execution of the Earl of Strafford,       an
      event that seriously grieved Charles I. and his wife, and that, in the
      end, was disastrous to both.
    
    
      In the midst of these scenes of terror, Mary, the princess-royal, who was
      just ten years of age, was publicly espoused, at Whitehall chapel, to the
      son of the Prince of Orange, a boy of eleven.
    
    
      The queen-mother had been so maligned by the rioters that she was
      terrified for her personal safety, and insisted on departing forthwith for
      Holland. She was escorted, by the king's orders, as far as Dover, and
      about the same time Charles I. set out on a journey to Scotland.
    
    
      During his absence the queen's confessor, Father Phillips, was summoned
      several times by parliament, for examination, and ominous threats were
      made regarding the establishment of Capuchins at Somerset House. Signs of
      civil war were daily becoming more numerous and more marked, Sir Edward
      Nicholas, the king's private secretary, wrote a letter urging his majesty
      to dismiss the monks at the next session of parliament; but he would take
      no decided steps in opposition to his wife's religion without consulting
      her. The consequence was that an infuriated mob destroyed the Capuchin
      chapel a year later.
    
    
      A.D. 1642. Among the queen's attendants was Lady
      Carlisle, who, while appearing loyal, was acting the part of  span
      class="pagenum">[162]a spy, and
      reporting every incident of the royal household to the Roundhead leaders.
    
    
      These Roundheads were Puritans, and it was Queen Henrietta herself who
      named them, because their hair was clipped so close and short that their
      heads looked like balls, and formed a marked contrast to the flowing locks
      of the courtiers.
    
    
      When parliament informed the queen that she must surrender her children
      into their hands until her husband's return, lest she should make papists
      of them, she refused, but left them at Oatlands and went to live at
      Hampton Court, hoping thus to keep her five little ones together and
      remove all cause of complaint. Her youngest child, Henry, was then only a
      few months old.
    
    
      Henrietta knew that she was closely watched, and had reason to fear that
      her children might at any moment be seized and taken away from her; so,
      like a true mother, she took every precaution to prevent it. She had a
      ship ready to receive them at Portsmouth, and a hundred cavaliers with a
      supply of five horses at her disposal; but no attack was made.
    
    
      The Irish rebellion broke out that autumn, attended with all the horrors
      of civil strife and religious persecution. The Roundheads accused Queen
      Henrietta of having encouraged the massacre, although there is no evidence
      of her having done so.
    
    
      When the king returned from Scotland he was received with every mark of
      loyalty. His family went to meet him, and the populace assembled to greet
      their sovereign. He entered the metropolis on horseback, the Prince of
      Wales rode by his side, and the queen, with her younger children, followed
      in an open carriage.
    
    
      While in Scotland the king had ascertained that five members of the house
      of commons were traitors; so, taking [163] a
      name="link163" id="link163">advantage of his popular reception on his
      return, he made up his mind to arrest them. He confided in no one but the
      queen. When he left her on the morning that he had fixed for the arrest,
      he said: "If you find one hour elapse without hearing ill news of me, you
      will see-me, when I return, the master of my kingdom."
    
    
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Original
    
    
      Queen Henrietta watched the clock anxiously until the hour had passed,
      then turning to the treacherous Lady Carlisle she exultingly exclaimed:
      "Rejoice with me, for at this hour the king is, as I have reason to
      believe, master of his realm, for Pym and his confederates are arrested
      before now."
    
    
      For this indiscretion King Charles paid dearly. He had been stopped at the
      entrance to the house of commons by a large number of persons, who
      presented petitions which he stood to read and discuss.
    
    
      This delay afforded Lady Carlisle ample time to dispatch one of her agents
      to inform the persons marked for arrest. They fled just as Charles entered
      the house, and their party organized a plan of resistance on the spot.
      [164]Insurrections
      followed, and the king and queen retired to Hampton Court to watch the
      result. Parliament then warned all the nobility to arm, and prevent the
      king from going further. King Charles was surprised; for he had not the
      least idea that any restraint would be put upon his personal freedom.
    
    
      The queen then proposed that she should go to Holland, under pretence of
      conveying the princess-royal to her young spouse, the Prince of Orange,
      but in reality for the purpose of selling her jewels to provide the king
      with means of defence. No opposition was made to her departure, and the
      Prince of Orange received her most cordially. Not so the Dutch
      burgomasters, who treated her with marked disrespect at first; but by the
      end of one year she had so won them over by her tact, diplomacy, and
      courteous manners that she had raised upwards of two million pounds
      sterling, all of which had been forwarded to her husband, who had raised
      his standard at Nottingham and commenced a warlike struggle.
    
    
      Meanwhile the Princess of Orange pursued her studies in Holland, where she
      soon won the affections of the people, and her alliance proved a most
      happy one.
    
    
      A.D. 1643. Queen Henrietta set out on her return
      to England just a year after she had left. She sailed in an English ship,
      accompanied by eleven smaller ones filled with stores and ammunition for
      the king. The fleet was commanded by the Dutch admiral Von Tromp.
    
    
      A tremendous gale blew them about for nearly a fortnight, the travellers
      suffering all the torments of sea-sickness, and expecting every moment to
      go to the bottom.
    
    
      The queen behaved bravely on this trying occasion, and cheerfully replied
      to the wailing and lamentations of her ladies: "Comfort yourselves, mes
      chères; queens of England are never drowned." The poor priests on
      board were as [165] a name="link165"
      id="link165">sick as the rest, but they had to listen to the
      confessions of the terrified ladies and gentlemen, who bawled out their
      sins, regardless of the presence of others, in a way that must have been
      truly amusing.
    
    
      At last the queen landed safely at a port near the Hague, having lost two
      of her ships. After two days' rest she again set sail, and made a quick
      voyage to Burlington, where, guarded by a thousand cavaliers on land, and
      Von Tromp at sea, she went ashore. The next morning, at dawn, five
      ships-of-war, that had entered the bay during the night, began a cannonade
      on the house where the queen was sleeping. She was obliged to rise in
      haste, put on her clothes, and seek shelter in a ditch some distance from
      the town of Burlington. Bullets fell thick about her as she hurried on
      foot to the place of shelter, and one of her servants was killed.
      Nevertheless, when Henrietta remembered that her favorite lap-dog had been
      left behind, she ran back, hastily climbed the stairs to her bed-chamber,
      caught up the animal, and carried it off in safety. One ball grazed the
      edge of the ditch where the royal party were concealed, and covered them
      with earth and stones. At night the attacking ships retreated, much to her
      majesty's relief, for she then remained quietly for ten days in the
      neighborhood of Burlington.
    
    
      While there she distributed arms to those gentlemen who seemed loyally
      disposed, and thus gained many friends for the king.
    
    
      A captain of one of the ships that had bombarded the queen's house on the
      morning after her arrival was caught on shore, tried by a military
      tribunal, and sentenced to be hung. The queen happened to meet the
      procession when the prisoner was being conducted to execution, and
      inquired what was the matter. She was told that King Charles's loyal
      subjects were about to punish a man who had aimed at her.  span
      class="pagenum">[166]"Ah,"
      replied the queen, "but he did not kill me, and he shall not be put to
      death on my account." The captain was then set at liberty, and so deeply
      was he touched by Henrietta's generosity that he came over to the royal
      cause, and persuaded several of his shipmates to do likewise.
    
    
      A.D. 1644. Previous to the battle of Newbury, so
      fatal to his cause, Charles escorted his wife to Abington, and there this
      devoted couple parted never to meet again.
    
    
      The queen was ill when the Earl of Essex advanced with his army to besiege
      the city in which she had taken refuge; but rising from her bed she
      escaped in disguise with one lady, one gentleman, and her confessor,
      leaving behind her an infant only a few weeks old.
    
    
      She hid for two days in a hut by the roadside three miles from Exeter, and
      lay couched under a heap of rubbish when the parliamentary soldiers
      marched by. She heard them say "that they meant to carry the head of
      Henrietta to London, and receive for it a reward of fifty thousand
      crowns." As soon as they were gone she stole out of her hiding-place, and
      with her three companions travelled on to a wood, which became the
      rendezvous that night for all her faithful attendants. Geoffrey Hudson,
      the dwarf, was of the number, and everybody was in disguise.
    
    
      The whole party pushed on to the coast and embarked on board a friendly
      Dutch vessel.
    
    
      Meanwhile the king, by a series of victories, had fought his way to
      Exeter, where he hoped to see his dear Henrietta, but she had been gone
      several days when he arrived. He beheld his new baby       a princess       for
      the first time, and had her baptized under the name of Henrietta Anne,
      after her mother and her good aunt in France.
    
    
      Queen Henrietta did not reach her native land without another trial; for
      her vessel was chased by a cruiser in the service of parliament, and
      several cannon balls fired at it. [167] a
      name="link167" id="link167">The danger of being taken or sunk became
      so great that the queen took command of the vessel herself, had every sail
      set for speed, urged the pilot to keep straight on his course, and charged
      the captain to fire the powder magazine if escape were impossible. She was
      determined not to fall into the hands of her husband's enemies, and
      preferred death to the disgrace of being dragged captive to London.
    
    
      However, she did not have to resort to such an extreme measure, for in a
      few hours she landed at Bretagne. Such a sorry spectacle did the queen and
      her attendants present that the natives took them for pirates and arose in
      arms against them; but no sooner were they convinced that it was the
      daughter of their beloved King Henry IV. who had sought refuge among them,
      than they speedily took measures to supply all her wants, and provided her
      with equipages to convey her to the baths of Bourbon, where she hoped to
      regain health and strength.
    
    
      Anne of Austria, who was then queen-regent, sent her confidential
      lady-of-honor to Henrietta, with offers of all the assistance it was in
      the power of France to bestow, and supplied her with liberal sums of
      money; but Queen Henrietta stripped herself of every farthing she could
      command to send to her husband, over whose misfortunes she wept
      constantly.
    
    
      Queen Henrietta was met on her return to Paris, and most affectionately
      welcomed by the queen-regent and the little King Louis IV., who escorted
      her to the Louvre, where a luxurious suite of apartments had been prepared
      for her. They treated her with the consideration due to a queen, and, as a
      daughter of France, she was supplied with the liberal income of twelve
      thousand crowns per month.
    
    
      But she deprived herself even of necessary comforts in order that she
      might keep her suffering husband supplied. A few days after her arrival in
      her native land she removed [168] a
      name="link168" id="link168">to St. Germains, a country-palace that the
      queen-regent had placed at her disposal. There she lived in retirement,
      and her wants being less, she was enabled to save larger sums to send to
      England.
    
    
      The affairs of King Charles had grown from bad to worse; and with his
      usual thoughtfulness for his family, he instructed his sons to escape from
      a country where neither he nor they could hope for protection.
    
    
      A.D. 1645. Accordingly both the Prince of Wales
      and the Duke of York made their way to Paris, where they spent some time
      with their mother, then joined the English fleet that had forsaken the
      Cromwell party, and was lying off the coast of Holland.
    
    
      The same year Lady Morton, who had been left at Exeter with the infant
      Henrietta Anne, made her escape, disguised as a beggar, and, with the
      child in her arms, travelled on until she placed her in her mother's lap.
      The queen's heart was gladdened at the sight of her little one, whom she
      covered with kisses, and called "child of benediction."
    
    
      She had made up her mind that this little princess should become a
      Catholic, and for that reason appointed Père Gamache to instruct her.
    
    
      Now, so long as the royal family of France were rich, Queen Henrietta
      shared their prosperity, and was treated with the utmost respect and
      consideration, but when their own civil wars reduced them to a state of
      destitution she had poverty added to her other troubles.
    
    
      She behaved nobly when her sister-in-law, Anne of Austria, was in danger
      from the fury of her own subjects, and left her quiet retreat at St.
      Germains to share her danger in Paris during the battles of the Fronde and
      the Barricades. It was she who acted as peacemaker between the
      queen-regent and her people, and she had become such [169] a
      name="link169" id="link169">a favorite in France that after much
      trouble and many privations she finally succeeded in restoring order.
    
    
      A.D. 1648. But the Christmas of 1648, before
      this was accomplished, Cardinal de Retz, who was one of the principal
      leaders of the Fronde, but a good friend to Queen Henrietta, found her
      shut up in an apartment of the Louvre with little Henrietta, without any
      fire, although it was a cold, snowy day. The sorrowing mother had kept the
      four-year old princess in bed lest she should suffer from the cold, but
      both were without food. The cardinal supplied the necessary comforts
      forthwith, and on the same day represented to the parliament of Paris the
      distress in which he had discovered the daughter of their former king. His
      eloquence was the outpouring of a kind heart, and met with an immediate
      response, for a subsidy of twenty thousand livres was instantly voted for
      the destitute queen.
    
    
      Then she wrote to Lord Fairfax in England, asking his assistance, that she
      might see her husband once more. This letter was delivered to the house of
      commons, and contemptuously thrown aside, with the remark "that the writer
      had been voted guilty of high treason in 1643."
    
    
      Thus ended all hope of being reunited to the husband whose afflictions she
      shared and for whose sake she would willingly have died. Added to this was
      the suspense the queen endured while the civil strife in Paris and its
      neighborhood rendered the passage of couriers impossible.
    
    
      King Charles might well have escaped from England and joined his wife, but
      nothing could induce him to enter France as a supplicant sovereign. He
      preferred to suffer and struggle alone, through four long years of insult
      and abuse,       most shocking to us of the present day to read about.
    
    
      The Roundheads grew so powerful that, with Oliver [170] a
      name="link170" id="link170">Cromwell for their leader, they became a
      body of ruffians, who either thrust into a dungeon or expelled any of
      their band who evinced the least mark of favor towards the king.
    
    
      Through treachery Charles I. had fallen a prisoner in their hands. They
      showed him no mercy; they granted him no justice. A handful of
      self-appointed judges went through the mockery of a trial, and condemned
      their unfortunate sovereign to the block.
    
    
      On the day before the execution Princess Elizabeth and the Duke of
      Gloucester, the only royal children who remained in England, were admitted
      to their father's prison to bid him farewell. They both sobbed
      passionately. King Charles drew them to his bosom with words of
      consolation, and solemnly blessed them.
    
    
      He told the princess not to grieve for him, for his was a glorious death,       for
      the laws and religion of the land; advised her what books to read; bade
      her to forgive his enemies, as he hoped God would, and charged her to be
      obedient to her mother, and to tell her that his love for her would be the
      same to the last.
    
    
      Then taking little Gloucester on his knee, he said: "Sweetheart, now will
      they cut off thy father's head. Heed, my child, what I say: they will cut
      off my head, and perhaps make thee king; but, mark what I say, you must
      not be a king so long as your brothers Charles and James live; therefore,
      I charge you, do not be made a king by them."
    
    
      Earnestly looking up into his father's face, the boy replied: "I will be
      torn in pieces first." This unexpected answer pleased his majesty, who
      with a few more words of advice fervently kissed his children, and ordered
      them to be taken away. They sobbed aloud, and the king turned away as they
      passed out, and leaned his head against the window trying to repress his
      tears. [171]While
      this painful interview was taking place Cromwell and his gang of ruffians
      sat in secret conclave to determine upon the hour of their victim's death;
      and some of them swore later that it was only violent threats on the part
      of their leader that forced them to place their signatures to the fatal
      warrant.
    
    
      The noble and dignified bearing of the king as he ascended the scaffold
      was noticed by all who saw him, and the populace, who were kept at a
      distance by a dense mass of soldiers, wept amidst their blessings and
      prayers for the martyr king.
    
    
      Charles made a short speech, saying that "if he had been a despot he might
      have remained their sovereign; but he died to preserve the liberties of
      the people of England." Some one touched the axe while he was speaking.
      "Have a care of the axe!" he exclaimed, "if the edge be spoiled it will be
      the worse for me."
    
    
      Then his executioner kneeled before him and asked forgiveness. Charles
      drew himself up with proud dignity and replied;       "No! I forgive no
      subject of mine who comes deliberately to shed my blood."
    
    
      He then said a short prayer, raised his eyes to heaven, then placed his
      head upon the block. It was severed with one blow, as a cry of agony arose
      from the horrified multitude.
    
    
      Queen Henrietta did not hear of the dreadful fate that had overtaken her
      husband for several days; and when at last it was communicated to her, she
      stood motionless as a statue, without words or tears.
    
    
      The visit of the Duchess de Vendôme, whom the queen tenderly loved,
      produced a change in the afflicted widow, who burst into a passionate fit
      of weeping at the tender words of sympathy expressed by her friend. She
      called [172]herself
      the most miserable woman on the face of the earth, and resolved to retire
      with a few of her ladies to the Carmelite Convent in Paris. She well knew
      that for the future life could contain nothing but bitterness for her, and
      said: "I have lost a crown, but that I had long ceased to regret; it is my
      husband for whom I grieve,       the good, just, wise, virtuous man, so
      worthy of my love and that of his subjects."
    
    
      She named herself La malheureuse reine, and mourned for King
      Charles to the day of her death.
    
    
      A.D. 1649. Queen Henrietta was not long
      permitted to enjoy the peaceful retirement of the convent; for her son,
      the Prince of Wales, determined to return to England, and desired to
      consult his mother about it. She therefore met him at St. Germains in the
      summer of 1649, and afterwards returned with him to her former apartments
      at the Louvre.
    
    
      In the following autumn, accompanied by his brother James, Duke of York,
      Charles went to the Isle of Jersey, where he was proclaimed King of Great
      Britain. Scotland acknowledged him next, and then followed the scenes of
      blood in Ireland, under the leadership of Cromwell, more horrible than any
      that had ever been witnessed in the world before.
    
    
      Charles was absent more than two years; and while he was contesting for
      his hereditary rights his young brother and sister, who were still
      prisoners in England, were treated very harshly by the republicans.
    
    
      A.D. 1650. In the September of 1650 Princess
      Elizabeth died of a malignant fever.
    
    
      Cromwell had established a strong military despotism in the British
      Islands; and when Queen Henrietta demanded of him the payment of her
      dower, he replied: "That she had never been recognized as Queen-Consort of
      Great [173]Britain
      by the people, consequently she had no right to a dower."
    
    
      This was because she had refused, on account of her religious bigotry, to
      be crowned with the king.
    
    
      But the usurper did her a great favor when he allowed the young Duke of
      Gloucester to return to her. The permit said: "That Henry Stuart, third
      son of the late Charles I., had leave to transport himself beyond seas."
    
    
      Queen Henrietta treated her sons most harshly because they refused to
      become Catholics, and adhered to the Episcopal church; in consequence a
      great deal of ill-feeling and enmity had grown up between her and them,
      which at last drove them from her.
    
    
      The young Duke of Gloucester went to Holland to live with his sister, the
      Princess of Orange, whose husband had died of small-pox a short time
      before she offered her brother an asylum.
    
    
      Queen Henrietta remained at the Palais Royal with her youngest child as a
      guest of the queen-regent.
    
    
      A.D. 1658. At last, in 1658, Cromwell died, and
      two years later Charles II. was restored to the throne of England, without
      the shedding of a single drop of blood. His brother, the young Duke of
      Gloucester, had accompanied Charles to England, where four months after
      the Restoration he died of small-pox.
    
    
      A.D. 1660. In October of 1660 the Duke of York
      met Queen Henrietta and his youngest sister at Calais, where they embarked
      for England in grand state. The vessels were all decked with gay flags,
      and as each one discharged her cannon in regular order the noise was so
      great that it could be distinctly heard at Dover. The channel was so calm
      that its surface looked like a mirror. Not a breath of wind was stirring,
      and it was two days before the English fleet could accomplish the passage
      that [174]usually
      took three or four hours. Fortunately the Duke of York had provided a
      sumptuous banquet for his mother, sister, and their whole retinue, which
      passed a few hours pleasantly, and saved the travellers from hunger.
    
    
      When the queen reached Dover, Charles II. went on board the vessel to
      welcome her, and conducted her to Dover Castle, where a pleasant surprise
      awaited her.
    
    
      Not only was a magnificent supper spread, but every member of the royal
      family of Stuart had assembled to receive Queen Henrietta, who once more
      had the satisfaction of embracing each of her children in turn.
    
    
      For the moment she was happy, surrounded by those she loved; but after she
      reached London she was overcome by the deepest sorrow. The sight of the
      apartments once occupied by her husband agonized her, and it wrung her
      heart to look upon the spot where he had suffered and died. She sank into
      the deepest melancholy, and would shut herself up for hours at a time,
      denying admittance to any of her ladies.
    
    
      Life in England became insupportable to the afflicted queen, and she
      determined to return to France.
    
    
      A.D. 1661. In the evening of New Year's Day she
      gave an audience to those who desired to bid her farewell, and then
      retired to Hampton Court.
    
    
      As the Princess Henrietta was engaged to be married to Philippe, the Duke
      of Orleans, parliament settled on her a liberal marriage-portion, and by
      the middle of January she sailed, with her mother, for France.
    
    
      Two months later the marriage between Princess Henrietta and the Duke of
      Orleans was solemnized at the Palais Royal; and when the young couple went
      to pass the summer at Fontainebleau, Queen Henrietta retired to her
      favorite château of Colombe, a few miles from Paris. The following year
      the Duke and Duchess of Orleans made her [175] a
      name="link175" id="link175">a long visit, then accompanied her to
      Calais, where she embarked to return to England once more.
    
    
      A.D. 1662. Charles II. had married Catharine of
      Braganza during his mother's absence, and the royal couple received Queen
      Henrietta affectionately, and welcomed her to Greenwich Palace. She
      remained with them until the summer, when Somerset House having been
      handsomely renovated, she set up her court there; but her health began to
      decline, and she sent for her son, the king, and told him that she could
      only regain strength in her native land. He urged her to repair to the
      Bourbon baths, though it grieved him sorely to part from his mother again.
    
    
      A.D. 1665. She went first to her château of
      Colombe, where the King and Queen of France met and welcomed her, and
      after a short season of repose she proceeded to the baths of Bourbon.
    
    
      A.D. 1669. But her health declined from year to
      year, and although her daughter and son-in-law were indefatigable in their
      loving attentions, and summoned the most celebrated physicians of Paris to
      her bedside, she expired suddenly and painlessly at midnight of August 31,
      1669.
    
    
      Charles II. and the Duke of York received the news with deep grief, and
      retired to Hampton Court, where they remained until all the mourning
      ceremonies were completed at Whitehall.
    
    
      Louis XIV. ordered a general mourning to be observed throughout France for
      his aunt,       not because she was a queen of England so much as because
      she was the last child of Henry IV. of France. [176] a

      CHAPTER VII. CATHARINE OF BRAGANZA, QUEEN OF CHARLES II., KING OF GREAT
      BRITAIN AND IRELAND.
    
    
      (A.D. 1638-1705.)
    
    
      It was on St.
      Catharine's day that this princess was born, in the year 1638, and it was
      in honor of that saint that she was named. When she came into the world,
      Portugal was under the rule of Spain, and had been so for sixty years, not
      because the Portuguese were contented with the despotic laws that governed
      them, but because they did not feel strong enough to fight for liberty.
    
    
      When a nation considers itself oppressed by tyrannical laws, secret
      organizations are sure to be formed for the purpose of shaking off the
      yoke in one way or another.
    
    
      In all the principal towns of Portugal these patriotic associations were
      formed at the time we speak of, for the purpose of throwing off the
      Spanish yoke; and the period was rapidly approaching when their efforts
      were to be crowned with success.
    
    
      It was to the Duke of Braganza, Catharine's father, the last of the old
      royal line, that the larger party looked with hope and confidence.
      Meanwhile, with a desire to keep clear of the watchful eye of his foes and
      the dangerous intrigues of his friends, the duke removed to his Palace of
      Villa Vicosa with his beloved wife, the Donna Luiza, and his two little
      sons. While living at that most charming spot, that has been justly named
      a terrestrial paradise, the [177] a
      name="link177" id="link177">duchess added a daughter to her family
      circle,       the little Catharine, of whom we have spoken. She was
      baptized at the parish chapel during the following month, and her
      godfather was a Spanish grandee of high rank and enormous wealth. The
      ceremony was performed with great pomp, and gifts of considerable value
      were bestowed upon the little girl. She was such a pet in her family, that
      each birthday was the occasion of a sumptuous fête. On the second
      anniversary of her birth an incident occurred which connected the
      celebration of it with no less important a matter than the emancipation of
      Portugal from the Spanish yoke. On that day Don Gaspar Cortigno arrived at
      the Villa Vicosa, and requested an immediate interview with the duke. This
      being granted, he presented an appeal from his countrymen, urging the duke
      to declare himself their leader, and to accept the crown to which he was
      justly entitled.
    
    
      A.D. 1640. The nobleman listened attentively to
      all that his visitor said; but he was at a loss for a reply, while, he
      thoughtfully considered his position. On the one hand was the Portuguese
      crown, which was his by inheritance, on the other the blessings of a happy
      home, with a charming, affectionate family, and the peaceful possession of
      estates, comprising not less than a third of the realm. Should he risk
      everything to embark upon an enterprise fraught with danger, perhaps ruin?
      He could not decide; but, like a dutiful husband, consulted Donna Luiza.
      Without a moment's hesitation, she replied: "This day our friends are
      assembled around us to celebrate the anniversary of the birth of our
      little Catharine; and who knows but this new guest may have been sent to
      certify to you that it is the will of Heaven, through especial grace, to
      invest you with that crown of which you have long been unjustly deprived
      by Spain. For my part I regard it as a happy [178] a
      name="link178" id="link178">presage that he comes on such day." Then
      lifting up her daughter, and holding her before the duke, she added, "How
      can you find it in your heart to refuse to confer on this child the rank
      of a king's daughter?" That was enough; the father decided, though the
      statesman had faltered; ambition for his children won the Duke of
      Braganza's consent, and thenceforth he would devote his life to the
      welfare of his country.
    
    
      A few days later he removed with his family to Lisbon, where he was
      proclaimed king, under the title of Juan IV. Then began a fierce struggle,
      in which many battles were fought and won by the Portuguese against their
      powerful enemy. They were fighting for freedom, and their desperate
      charges counterbalanced the superior numbers of Spain. In moments of
      discouragement and despondency Donna Luiza was always near to fill her
      husband's breast with courage and hope.
    
    
      A.D. 1644. England immediately recognized Don
      Juan as sovereign of Portugal; but the pope refused to do so, and was
      imitated by all the Catholic courts of Europe, excepting France. Four
      years were spent in battling for the liberty which was won at last by a
      decisive overthrow of the Spanish forces in 1644.
    
    
      Having accomplished this, Juan IV. sent Sabran as ambassador to England to
      negotiate a marriage between the Prince of Wales, who afterwards became
      Charles II., and his little daughter Catharine. The treasury of King
      Charles was so nearly empty at that time, that the liberal dower Juan was
      able to bestow upon the infanta would no doubt have been very acceptable,
      but there were other considerations. Catharine of Braganza was a Catholic;
      and as the difference of religion had created so much unhappiness between
      himself and his own wife, Charles I. hesitated to thrust the same domestic
      infelicity on his son, who was
    
    
      [179]
    
    
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Original
    
    
      [181]of
      course a Protestant. And so, for the time being, no decisive measures
      could be taken for the marriage.
    
    
      A.D. 1656. Don Juan did not live long to enjoy
      the lofty position for which he had struggled so desperately; for he died
      towards the close of the year 1656, in the prime of life, but worn out
      with care and anxiety.
    
    
      By her father's death Princess Catharine became an heiress of great
      wealth; for Don Juan left a will bequeathing to his daughter the island of
      Madeira, the city of Lanego, and the town of Moura, with all their
      territories and rents. She received other sources of income, besides, with
      the proviso that if she married in a foreign land, she was to relinquish
      all to the crown and receive the equivalent in money.
    
    
      Donna Luiza carefully studied the aspect of affairs in other countries
      besides the one she ruled, and her penetration enabled her to foresee that
      the restoration of Charles II. to the throne of England was merely a
      matter of time. That being the case, she made up her mind to work for an
      alliance between that prince and her daughter, hoping thereby to
      strengthen the position of her own realm. All other proposals, therefore,
      for the hand of the infanta were regarded with disfavor.
    
    
      The elder Princess Dowager of Orange was not so keen-sighted; for when
      Charles was sojourning at a village in Flanders, while he was still an
      exile, he fell in love with the Princess Henrietta, daughter of Frederick
      Henry, Prince of Orange, and would have married her, but the dowager
      declined the offer, saying, "that she saw no chance for the amendment of
      his fortunes."
    
    
      A few months latter, when a deputation from parliament arrived with fifty
      thousand pounds for Prince Charles, and an invitation to return to
      England, the old lady could have bitten her tongue out for the blunder she
      had made, and endeavored to repair it. [182] a
      name="link182" id="link182">But Charles was too indignant to listen to
      any of her overtures, or ever to forgive the insult she had offered him in
      his adversity.
    
    
      A.D. 1660. Henrietta was extremely anxious to
      see her eldest son united in marriage with a princess of her own faith;
      so, once when she was on a visit to England, she manoeuvred until matters
      were brought to such a point that the Portuguese ambassador was authorized
      to interview the prince's lord chamberlain on the subject. The former
      important personage was no other than Don Francisco de Mello, the
      godfather of Catharine. He began by praising the virtues of the king, and
      added, "that it was time he should bestow himself in marriage, and that
      nothing ought to keep him single but the difficulty of finding a suitable
      consort."
    
    
      The lord chamberlain, Earl of Manchester, assented. Thereupon Don
      Francisco continued: "There is in Portugal a princess, in her beauty,
      person, and age, very fit for the king, who would have a portion suitable
      to her birth and quality. She is a Catholic, to be sure, and would never
      depart from her religion; but she has none of that meddling activity which
      sometimes makes persons of any faith troublesome when they come into a
      country where another mode of worship than their own is practised. She has
      been bred under a wise mother, who has taught her not to interfere in
      state affairs, of which she is entirely ignorant." The ambassador
      concluded by informing the earl that he was authorized to propose the
      princess for a wife to the king, accompanied with offers such as no other
      power in Europe could make.
    
    
      This conversation was duly reported to Charles, who sent to Don Francisco
      for further particulars. An early interview was granted the ambassador,
      who repeated what he had said to the lord chamberlain, and added,
      furthermore, [183] a name="link183"
      id="link183">"that he was authorized to offer five hundred thousand
      pounds sterling in cash as a portion for the Infanta Catharine, besides
      the possession of Tangier, on the coast of Africa, which was to be made
      over to the crown of England forever. Free trade in the Brazil and the
      East Indies was to be granted to the English nation; and the island of
      Bombay, with its spacious bay, towns, and castles, was likewise to belong
      to them."
    
    
      Charles was dazzled with such a brilliant offer, and hastened to consult
      Lord Clarendon, his prime minister, on the subject.
    
    
      Clarendon refused to offer immediate advice, and asked, "whether his
      majesty had given up all thought of a Protestant wife."
    
    
      Charles replied, "that he could not find one, except among his own
      subjects, and he had seen no one of their number, who had pleased him
      sufficiently for that purpose."
    
    
      A secret meeting was then called of several members of his council, over
      which the king presided in person. He stated the business for which he had
      requested their presence, and pointed out the importance of Tangier for
      the benefit of trade on the Mediterranean sea.
    
    
      One of the lords suggested the advisability of a Protestant queen. Charles
      asked "where he should find one?" Several German princesses were
      mentioned, whereupon he exclaimed, impatiently: "Odds fish! They are all
      dull and foggy; I cannot like one of them for a wife."
    
    
      It was then unanimously agreed that a matrimonial treaty should be opened,
      with all possible secrecy, with Portugal.
    
    
      Delighted with the success of his mission, Don Francisco de Mello offered
      to go back to his native land to complete the necessary arrangements.
      [184]The
      court of Lisbon was filled with rejoicing when the object of Don
      Francisco's return was announced. He was rewarded with the title of Count
      da Ponte, and sent back to England with full power to conclude the
      marriage.
    
    
      A.D. 1661. It was late in January when the count
      again set foot in London. To his surprise, the whole aspect of affairs had
      changed, and he could not even obtain an interview with the king.
    
    
      The reason for the change was this: The representatives of Spain knew well
      that it would redound to their disadvantage if an alliance between the
      royal houses of England and Portugal should be cemented; they therefore
      endeavored to prevent it. One of their number happened to be on terms of
      intimacy with Charles, and could, therefore, speak plainly on the subject
      of his prospective marriage.
    
    
      His arguments made little impression until he dared to attack the princess
      herself; but when he affirmed that she was ugly, deformed, and delicate,
      the king began to fear that perhaps he had allowed himself to be too
      easily influenced. The Earl of Bristol was a particular enemy of
      Clarendon, and prided himself on throwing a wet blanket over every project
      that minister seemed to favor. The earl had just returned from a visit to
      Portugal, and corroborated every statement made by the Spanish envoy,
      merely for the sake of opposition. At the same time he drew a graphic
      picture of some of the Italian princesses he had met, and assured the king
      that if he would make his selection from their number, the Spanish
      government would agree to give the lady of his choice as large a portion
      as though she were of their royal blood.
    
    
      As Charles was not in love with Catharine of Braganza, never having laid
      eyes on her, he was easily turned from his purpose, and broke off all
      negotiations with the Portuguese court. [185] a
      name="link185" id="link185">But he did not abandon his intention to
      marry; and so despatched the Earl of Bristol to Parma to make minute
      inquiries as to the qualifications of the princesses of that court. The
      well-known fondness of Charles II. for handsome women obliged the earl to
      make his observations with great care; so when one glance at the ladies,
      on their way to church, convinced him that one was too fat, and both were
      too ugly, to please his royal master, he dared not present a favorable
      report.
    
    
      Meanwhile the king had taken pains to inquire of other travellers who had
      been to Portugal, what sort of a woman the infanta really was; and the
      descriptions he got were so different from those presented by the
      Spaniards, that he altered his manner towards Don Francisco, and began to
      show him many marks of courtesy.
    
    
      This enraged Vatteville, the Spanish ambassador, to such a degree, that he
      openly declared, "that he was directed by the king, his master, to let his
      majesty know, that, if he should proceed towards a marriage with the
      daughter of his rebel, the Duke of Braganza, he had orders to take his
      leave presently, and declare war against him."
    
    
      This excited the king's indignation, and he manfully replied, "that the
      ambassador might be gone as soon as he liked."
    
    
      Then Vatteville found that he had gone too far, and resorted to the most
      fulsome flattery in order to conciliate the irate king.
    
    
      At last a special messenger arrived from France with a private
      communication from Louis XIV., expressing regret that any obstruction to
      the Portuguese match had arisen; and assuring King Charles that Catharine
      was a lady of rare beauty and accomplishments.
    
    
      While Charles hesitated, he received a portrait of the dark-eyed infanta,
      which, after all, made a deeper impression [186] a
      name="link186" id="link186">on his heart than diplomatists, promises
      of wealth, or the reasoning of his lord-chancellor, could ever have
      accomplished. In this portrait the princess was represented as a brilliant
      brunette, with large, dark eyes, and a profusion of brown hair arranged in
      short curls on each side of the head, and falling to the waist in ringlets
      at the back. "This person cannot be unhandsome," said the king, gazing
      attentively on the face of the woman he was so soon to marry.
    
    
      The ambassador was summoned, and requested to repeat to his majesty all
      that England was to gain in the event of his marriage with the Portuguese
      princess. Don Francisco assured Charles that the money he had promised in
      the name of the queen-regent was all sealed up in bags awaiting
      transportation; and that the fleet which was to be sent for the princess
      might even go first and take possession of Tangiers.
    
    
      It was further agreed that the marriage should take place in England,
      although it was not customary for any princess to join her husband in a
      foreign land until after the ceremony had been performed with a proxy
      acting as bridegroom.
    
    
      Donna Luiza preferred this arrangement, because the pope had never
      acknowledged the independence of Portugal; and, as it would be necessary
      to apply for a dispensation before a marriage could be contracted between
      a Catholic and a Protestant, she feared that he would mention Catharine
      only as the daughter of the Duke of Braganza, and not as a princess. This
      would have been a serious affront to the royal house of Portugal, and most
      injurious to their cause.
    
    
      On his part, Charles avoided anything disagreeable that might arise at the
      coronation of a Catholic queen in England, by having himself crowned
      before such a person ex-
    
    
      [187]
    
    
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Original
    
    
      isted. [189]Consequently,
      that ceremony was appointed for St. George's day, April 23, 1661, and was
      celebrated with great splendor and universal rejoicing.
    
    
      The following month Charles II. opened parliament in person, and imparted
      the news that he intended to marry "the daughter of Portugal."
    
    
      In June, the treaty which united England and Portugal was signed by King
      Charles at Whitehall; and the acquisition of Bombay, which it granted,
      gave England a foothold in India that she has retained ever since, as we
      know.
    
    
      The contract secured for Catharine the free exercise of her religion and
      the privilege of fitting up a chapel in any palace she might occupy,
      besides a settled income of thirty thousand pounds a year, with full
      liberty to return to her native land, should she become a widow, without
      forfeiting her jointure.
    
    
      Meanwhile, Vatteville was so enraged at being outdone, that, although a
      Catholic representative, he circulated papers among the populace, setting
      forth the ills that must necessarily arise in England from the
      introduction of a popish queen. He meant to do this secretly, but was
      caught in the act of distributing some of these documents from his own
      window among the soldiers. The king was so indignant that he sent his
      secretary of state to order the ambassador's immediate departure.
      Vatteville begged to be allowed to ask his majesty's pardon, but his
      request was not granted, and the troublesome busybody was obliged to go
      back to Spain without being permitted to speak to the king again.
    
    
      There was great rejoicing in Lisbon when the Count da Ponte arrived with
      full power from the king to complete the arrangements for his marriage,
      and the streets rang with the cry of, "Long live the King of Great
      Britain, whom God hath raised to protect us from our implacable foes!" The
      count was the bearer of a letter from the king to [190] a
      name="link190" id="link190">Donna Luiza, as well as one to the
      princess, whom he addressed as "The Queen of Great Britain, my wife, and
      lady, whom God preserve." Both were considered fine specimens of
      letter-writing in their day, and prove Charles II. to have been a clever
      correspondent. As soon as the marriage treaty was ratified, Catharine was
      addressed as queen, and treated with the utmost deference at her brother's
      court. A great change had suddenly come to the life of this young girl,
      and she was called upon to fill a position for which she was totally
      unprepared, and to become the wife of a merry monarch, whose views of life
      were entirely different from her own. We cannot help pitying her at the
      outset. She had been brought up under the most rigid laws, kept in
      seclusion, and only began to appear in public after she assumed the proud
      title of Queen of England. Ignorant of the trials that awaited her in the
      future, Catharine watched for the arrival of the Earl of Sandwich and the
      fleet that was to convey her to England with the utmost impatience. No
      anxiety as to her fate marred the bright hopes of the young girl whose
      path seemed strewn with roses; she beheld not the hidden thorns while
      listening to the flattering representations of those around her, and
      prepared herself to leave her family and her native land without a pang.
    
    
      It was not until he had cleared the Mediterranean of pirates, taught
      Algiers and Tunis to respect the British flag, and taken possession of
      Tangiers in the name of his sovereign, that the Earl of Sandwich made his
      appearance in the Bay of Lisbon. Now it happened that the Spanish troops
      were marching to besiege a seaport town near Lisbon just when the English
      ships sailed into the harbor, and as the town was not prepared for
      resistance, it must certainly have fallen, and the consequences have been
      disastrous to Portugal. But alarmed at the assistance that had come,  span
      class="pagenum">[191]just in the
      nick of time to their enemies, the Spaniards made a precipitate retreat,
      and Catharine congratulated herself upon being the means of saving her
      country from ruin.
    
    
      Sir Richara Fanshawe was the bearer of a miniature of King Charles to his
      lady-love, accompanied by an affectionate letter. Catharine was delighted
      with it, and made numerous inquiries about her royal lover, whose romantic
      history had excited her admiration and wonder.
    
    
      Charles passed the winter in making preparations for the reception of his
      bride; and while he was so engaged there were magnificent displays of
      fireworks, illuminations, and bull-fights at Lisbon for the amusement of
      the English guests; and the queen-regent was so well pleased with the
      Count da Ponte's good management, that she signified her approval of it by
      again promoting him. He was created Marquez de Sande.
    
    
      The greatest formality was observed at the reception of the Earl of
      Sandwich, and no point of etiquette was omitted that might tend to add to
      the importance of the occasion.
    
    
      The earl had the honor of being presented to the queen-regent and Queen
      Catharine, to whom he delivered letters from King Charles, written in
      Spanish.
    
    
      Several English gentlemen of rank were presented to the Queen of Great
      Britain, who had been appointed officers of her household by the king, her
      husband, and she admitted them formally to their different posts.
    
    
      Fêtes and rejoicings were the order of the day; and nothing else
      was thought of until the moment for handing over the money arrived. Then
      trouble began; and this is by no means the first instance of its arising
      from a similar cause.
    
    
      In consequence of the late advance of the Spanish army,  span
      class="pagenum">[192]Donna Luiza
      had been compelled to fall back on some of the gold she had reserved for
      her daughter's portion, to meet the expenses incurred for the defence of
      her realm. So she sent for the Earl of Sandwich, and after making profuse
      apologies, and explaining her difficulty, offered to pay down half the
      promised sum at once, and pledged herself to deliver the rest within the
      year.
    
    
      The ambassador was perplexed. He had been ordered to receive the entire
      sum, and knew perfectly well how much his sovereign depended upon it.
      Besides, he had already taken possession of Tangier, and had stationed an
      English garrison there. He dared not incur the expense of removing the
      troops back home, nor would his gallantry permit him to insult the lady he
      was sent to convey to England by leaving her behind. His was an
      exceedingly delicate position, and he behaved like a kind-hearted
      gentleman by consenting to receive Catharine with half the sum of money
      originally offered. Then rose another difficulty, which proves that Donna
      Luiza was more diplomatic than honest; for when it came to the delivery of
      the bags, they were found to contain, not gold, but sugar, spices, and
      other merchandise, which had been valued by the Portuguese at a much
      higher rate than was fair.
    
    
      This was an imposition against which the Earl of Sandwich violently
      protested, but that did him no good, for he could get nothing else unless
      he would accept jewels, which he positively refused. After a great deal of
      argument, it was at last arranged that Diego Silvas, a man of wealth and
      excellent character, should accompany the goods as supercargo, dispose of
      them in London, and pay the sum realized thereon to the king's exchequer.
      At the same time a bond was given by the government of Portugal for the
      payment of the residue within the space of a year. Thus everything was
      settled at last, and the royal bride [193] a
      name="link193" id="link193">took her departure. Although she was
      leaving her mother and her native land, Catharine did not shed a tear.
      Everything seems to have been sacrificed for the formality of court
      etiquette       no sentiment being permissible.
    
    
      The young queen, followed by the king and Don Pedro, her two brothers, the
      officers of the royal household, and a train of grandees, emerged from her
      apartments and descended the grand staircase to the main hall, where, at
      the entrance to the court chapel, she was met by her mother. This was the
      spot appointed for the leave-taking of the two queens. Catharine asked
      permission to kiss her mother's hand, whereupon Donna Luiza folded her in
      a fond embrace, and blessed her. Then they parted, and Catharine was led
      to her carriage between her two brothers. Before entering she turned and
      made a profound courtesy to the queen-mother, who forthwith retired.
      Perhaps in the privacy of her own chamber, this woman, who, though a
      queen, was still a mother, gave vent to the emotions she had schooled
      herself to conceal.
    
    
      It was St. George's day, and that saint being the patron of Portugal as
      well as of England, the festival was celebrated with more than the
      customary splendor.
    
    
      Amidst salvos of artillery the queen's barge approached the "Royal
      Charles," which carried eighty cannon and six hundred men, and Catharine
      was assisted to mount the ladder that had been built for her special use.
    
    
      As soon as she got on board, a salute was fired by the British fleet, and
      answered by the Portuguese forts. Then, having been formally delivered
      over to the Earl of Sandwich, Queen Catharine was conducted to her cabin,
      where she bade farewell to her two brothers, who immediately returned to
      the city.
    
    
      Everything was now ready for the fleet to set sail excepting the wind,
      which proved contrary, and prevented the [194] a
      name="link194" id="link194">ships from leaving the bay. That night
      there was a general illumination and a magnificent display of fireworks,
      both on land and water. The wind continued unfavorable throughout the next
      day, and the queen-mother sent frequently to inquire how her daughter
      fared on shipboard. There was no complaint to make; for the royal cabin
      and state-room were most luxuriously fitted up with damask furniture and
      curtains, costly carpets, and soft downy cushions.
    
    
      A little surprise was prepared for Queen Catharine that night by her
      brother, the king, who with Don Pedro and a chosen party of courtiers,
      embarked in several barges with their musical instruments, and serenaded
      the departing princess, performing the music and singing the sonnets and
      madrigals that had been composed in honor of her nuptials.
    
    
      On the morning of the twenty-fifth the wind changed and the voyage began.
      The fleet consisted of fourteen men-of-war; but only three, the "Royal
      Charles," the "Gloucester," and the "Royal James," were occupied by
      Catharine of Braganza, her attendants, and officers of state. The others
      contained the queen's equipage and the merchandise that represented half
      her dowry. There were more than a hundred Portuguese in Catharine's suite,
      the principal ones being two ladies of the highest rank, Donna Maria de
      Portugal, Countess de Penalva, and sister to the Marquis de Sande, and
      Donna Elvira de Vilpena, Countess de Ponteval. These were appointed to chaperon
      the bride. Six noble young ladies formed part of the suite also, and an
      English count very discourteously described them as "six frights, calling
      themselves maids-of-honor, and a duenna, another monster, who took the
      title of governess to these extraordinary beauties." Besides these, there
      were six chaplains, four bakers, a perfumer, and a barber.
    
    
      The voyage to England was so tempestuous that some of [195] a
      name="link195" id="link195">the vessels had to put in at Mount's Bay
      for repairs. All the passengers suffered terribly from sea-sickness, and
      many of them from terror. The Duke of York's squadron awaited the fleet
      off the Isle of Wight, and as soon as it appeared in sight the royal
      brother-in-law sent his secretary in a boat to ask permission to kiss
      Queen Catharine's hand. Having obtained it, the duke, accompanied by Lord
      Chesterfield, the Duke of Ormond, Lord Carlingford, the Earl of Suffolk,
      and others, all in full dress, went in a barge to the admiral's ship. The
      Marquez de Sande received the party and conducted them to the royal cabin.
      Catharine, dressed in an English costume, was seated on a throne, under a
      richly embroidered canopy, when the duke was announced. She advanced to
      meet him; he knelt to kiss her hand, but she quickly raised him, and
      allowed him to salute her cheek. Then returning to her throne, Catharine
      conversed for a few minutes with his highness, her almoner, Russell,
      acting as interpreter. But the Duke of York spoke Spanish well; so in a
      few moments, after he had taken a seat by the queen's invitation on her
      left, he continued the conversation in that tongue.
    
    
      When the royal brother-in-law retired, Catharine advanced beyond the
      canopy with him, but he tried to prevent it, telling her "she should
      recollect her rank," whereupon she sweetly replied, "that she wished to do
      that out of affection which she was not obliged to do." This answer
      pleased the duke so much that he called to see his sister-in-law every
      day, and a most friendly relation was established between them. On one
      occasion he expressed a desire to see her in her national dress; so the
      next day she received him attired as a Portuguese lady.
    
    
      The fleet arrived at Portsmouth, May 13, the Duke of York's boat following
      the "Royal Charles," and the duke himself handed the queen to her barge,
      when she disembarked. [196] a name="link196"
      id="link196">Countess de Pontevel attended Catharine, but Countess
      Benalva was too ill to leave the ship. The governor of Portsmouth, the
      city officials, and the leading persons of the neighborhood assembled on
      the beach to welcome the queen, who entered an open carriage and drove
      through the principal streets, to gratify the people's desire for a look
      at her. She had the good sense to appear in an English costume, so that
      she would not seem so much of a stranger among her new subjects. It was
      not until five days after his bride landed at Portsmouth that King Charles
      found time to leave home. He was accompanied by Prince Rupert, his cousin,
      and attended by a troop of his bodyguard. On reaching Portsmouth he went
      directly to visit the queen. The Marquez de Sande and other dignitaries
      awaited his approach, and after being graciously received by the king,
      conducted him to an apartment, where he made his toilet before presenting
      himself to her majesty.
    
    
      Catharine had been ill for several days with sore throat and cold, and was
      still confined to her bed, which, by the physician's order, she was
      forbidden to leave. But now that he had come, Charles was so anxious to
      see her that he insisted on entering her chamber at once. The Earl of
      Sandwich had the honor of attending him; and the interview, which was
      conducted in Spanish, was entirely satisfactory to all parties. Charles
      expressed his pleasure at seeing his bride, and kindly assured her that he
      was delighted to hear from her physician that her indisposition was not
      serious. She answered with so much prudence and discretion all the king's
      questions that when he returned to his apartments he congratulated himself
      on the fortunate choice that had been made for him.
    
    
      The following morning Catharine was so much better that it was decided to
      have the marriage ceremony performed without delay. This was accordingly
      done after the [197] a name="link197"
      id="link197">manner of the Catholic ritual, no one being present but
      the Portuguese ambassador, a few nobles and ladies. After the queen's
      conscience was satisfied in this regard, it was necessary that the king's
      should be also; therefore a public Protestant ceremony took place in the
      afternoon, Sir Richard Fanshawe having the honor of being the king's
      groomsman.
    
    
      The king was so delighted with his bride that he wrote his chancellor from
      Portsmouth: "I am so well satisfied that I cannot tell you how happy I am,
      and I must be the worst man living (which I hope I am not) if I be not a
      good husband, for I am confident that no two dispositions were ever better
      suited to each other than my wife's and mine."
    
    
      The royal couple arrived at Hampton Court on the 29th, which, being the
      anniversary both of the king's birth and restoration, was observed as a
      national holiday. The usual rejoicings in honor of the queen's first
      appearance among her London subjects took place, and she was welcomed with
      every token of popular favor that could be devised. When their majesties
      alighted from their carriage they passed through a line of guards, and
      were closely followed by the two Portuguese countesses and other ladies
      and gentlemen of the royal household. The high officials were assembled at
      the palace to greet her majesty and kiss her hand, and the foreign
      ministers were also present to offer congratulations of their respective
      sovereigns. As her majesty passed through the long suites of rooms the
      nobility, gentry, and ladies of the court were presented to her according
      to their rank. Poor Queen Catharine was so fatigued by the time she had
      seen so many strange faces, made innumerable bows, and had her hand kissed
      ad nauseam, that she was obliged to retire to her bedroom for a
      short repose. The same evening the [198] a
      name="link198" id="link198">Duchess of York arrived from London to pay
      her respects to her royal sister-in-law. She was met by the king at the
      garden gate, and led at once to the presence of the queen, who embraced
      her affectionately. Then the royal family seated themselves in the queen's
      bed-chamber and partook of a cup of tea, or "China drink," as it was
      called when introduced into England only a year or two before.
    
    
      However, Catharine of Braganza was the first tea-drinking queen of
      England, and no doubt she and her sister-in-law of York became quite well
      acquainted over their social cup the first day they met.
    
    
      A portrait in the historical gallery at Versailles, painted by Lely,
      represents Catharine as a very pretty little woman at the time of her
      marriage. Her eyes, complexion, and hair are dark and handsome, and
      unmistakably those of a Spanish lady.
    
    
      The queen's bed at Hampton Court was covered with crimson velvet,
      embroidered in silver, at a cost of eight thousand pounds, and was
      presented to Charles on his departure from Holland to assume the crown.
      The large mirror and toilet were of beaten gold,       a present from the
      queen-mother, Henrietta,       and the hangings were all of silk and gold,
      with embroidered canopies. Valuable paintings adorned the walls, luxurious
      carpets covered the floors, and magnificent Indian cabinets, brought from
      Portugal, stood in various parts of the palace.
    
    
      The new and brilliant scenes by which Catharine was surrounded were all so
      strange that, while they interested her, she found them very fatiguing.
      She had been bred in a convent, as we know, and felt more real
      gratification in her daily devotional exercises than in the gayety in
      which she was often compelled to take a leading part, even when her
      interest was not awakened. She heard mass daily, and was disposed to spend
      so much time in her chapel that the
    
    
      [199]
    
    
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Original
    
    
      [201]ambassador,
      her godfather, felt called upon to remind her of her duties as queen and
      wife.
    
    
      King Charles was the most witty, fascinating prince in Europe, thoroughly
      good-natured, brave, reckless, devoted to pleasure, and devoid of
      religious and moral principles. The free and easy manners of his court
      shocked the innocent, virtuous little queen to such a degree that she
      would have preferred not to appear in public at all. But her naivete
      amused her husband, who devised all sorts of pleasures for her
      entertainment.
    
    
      But Catharine's dream of happiness was soon to end in a rude awakening,
      when her tender, loving husband became unkind and unreasonable. There was
      a very bad woman at the English court, named Lady Castlemaine, whose
      husband was living in France This woman had managed by her wicked
      intrigues to gain great influence over the king, and she was universally
      despised by everybody excepting his majesty. The queen-mother in Portugal
      had heard of this creature, and warned her daughter to have no
      communication with her whatever. Therefore, when Charles, most
      unreasonably, presented her name, at the head of the list of ladies whom
      he recommended for appointments in the royal household, the queen crossed
      it off. Charles remonstrated, but Catharine was firm; thereupon Charles
      asserted his authority as king and husband. Catharine became excessively
      indignant, and passionately refused to have Lady Castlemaine among her
      ladies. The matter was dropped for the moment; but the king assumed an
      injured air, and made himself disagreeable for a few days after; without
      the slightest warning he introduced the objectionable party to the queen
      before her whole court. He knew that he was wrong, and, like many a man
      before and since, felt angry with his wife because such was the case. He
      reproached her with being stubborn and undutiful, and [202] a
      name="link202" id="link202">used threats that he never meant to put
      into execution. She burst into tears, told him that he was tyrannical and
      unkind, and declared that she would go back to Portugal.
    
    
      One would suppose that the sight of a young, pretty woman in distress
      would have moved the sympathies of the gay, light-hearted king; but he was
      not accustomed to being ruled in that way, so he merely replied: "That she
      would do well first to learn whether her mother would receive her, and he
      would soon give her an opportunity for knowing, for he would forthwith
      send home all her Portuguese servants, who had, he knew, encouraged her in
      her perverseness."
    
    
      Everybody at court knew that the king and queen had quarrelled, for they
      scarcely looked at each other. If Catharine had known how to manage her
      husband she might have won him; but she was too honest to flatter him more
      than he deserved, and loved him too well to let him suppose she could
      justify his conduct when she knew how much he had been to blame. She spent
      hours at a time in her room weeping, while he amused himself with his
      friends and treated his wife with indifference. He was more deeply
      offended at her wishing to leave him than at any of her angry reproaches,
      and sent Lord Clarendon to talk to her in his behalf. She was very
      penitent, but insisted that she ought to have the privilege of selecting
      her own servants, and would on no account consent to the presence of an
      objectionable person.
    
    
      After that King Charles brutally upbraided her with the non-performance of
      the marriage treaty with regard to her dowry,       though she was not to
      blame for it,       and insulted the Portuguese ambassador on her account.
      Diego Silvas was thrown into prison because he was unable to complete
      arrangements for paying the sum of money which was, in reality, not yet
      due. Catharine knew that these indignities [203] a
      name="link203" id="link203">were aimed at herself, and felt very
      unhappy that others should be made to suffer on her account.
    
    
      A temporary reconciliation was effected between the royal couple by the
      visit of Queen Henrietta, who declared that she had come to England with
      the express intention of offering her congratulations on their marriage.
      She set up her court at Greenwich Palace, and on the day after her arrival
      the young couple paid their first state visit together. Queen Henrietta
      awaited them at the first door of the palace after they ascended the
      stairs; and when she took the poor, neglected, almost heart-broken
      Catharine in her arms, and folded her in a motherly embrace, the young
      woman must have felt that she had found a friend at last. The queen-mother
      could speak no Spanish, and Catharine little English, but the king and the
      Duke of York acted as interpreters. It is probable that Queen Henrietta
      meant to intimate to her son, and to all the courtiers present, the
      respect due the young queen when she said: "That she should never have
      come to England again, except for the pleasure of seeing her, to love her
      as a daughter, and serve her as a queen." Catharine replied with gratified
      pleasure, "That in love and obedience, neither the king nor any of her
      children should exceed her." This visit lasted four hours, and seems to
      have had a good effect, for on their return to Hampton Court the king and
      queen supped in public, much to the delight of their court; and the next
      evening, when the king returned from a trip to London, her majesty went
      some distance on the road with her household to meet him.
    
    
      Queen Henrietta returned the visit of the royal couple, and spent nearly a
      month at Hampton Court, going back to London on the 23d of August, the day
      appointed for Catharine to make her first public entrance into the
      metropolis. [204] a name="link204"
      id="link204">This was done with great magnificence; crowds of people
      gathering to the banks of the Thames to view the array of boats that
      floated in attendance upon the royal barges. At six o'clock in the evening
      the king and queen, with their attendants, landed at Whitehall Bridge,
      where the queen-mother, with her whole court, all in rich attire, waited
      to receive them.
    
    
      A series of entertainments succeeded; and King Charles, once having
      introduced Lady Castlemaine at court, insisted upon her presence always,
      though his conscience often pricked him for doing what he knew to be
      wrong. The fact was that he was surrounded by people who recognized no law
      but their own desires; and whenever they saw Charles disposed to yield to
      his wife's just opposition to the woman who entertained them, and who was
      one of them in dissipation, they jeered at him. He, on the other hand, had
      not the moral courage to do right in spite of his friends. It was not
      because he respected Catharine less, but that he loved pleasure more. We
      must not suppose that all his statesmen approved of his conduct; on the
      contrary, Lord Clarendon and others took him to task as much as they
      dared, and considered the queen an ill-used wife.
    
    
      Charles had threatened to send all the Portuguese attendants back home,
      and at the expiration of four months after their arrival in England he
      determined to carry the threat into execution.
    
    
      This was a sore trial to her, particularly as the king fixed upon a day
      for their departure without naming any reward for their services, or
      sending a letter to the Queen of Portugal to explain his reason for
      dismissing them. Catharine would have remunerated them herself, but she
      had no money, and so could not afford to be generous. She begged her
      husband to permit her to retain a few of them, and as a great favor he
      consented to the old Countess of Penalva, [205] a
      name="link205" id="link205">two or three of the cooks, and the priests
      who officiated in her majesty's chapel.
    
    
      Now, as we have said, the king's conduct was not approved by all the
      statesmen; there were some among the most faithful of them who were so
      pained at the course he was pursuing that they ventured to censure him for
      it. But he paid little heed to their wise counsel, and the party of which
      they were the representatives grew daily in numbers and power. Had Queen
      Catharine not been a most sensible and magnanimous woman, she might well
      have united herself to this party in opposition to her husband, and
      created no end of disturbance; but she loved King Charles devotedly, and
      was willing to make any sacrifice to obtain his affection in return. She
      was wrong; for, while she opposed him, he could not but respect her,
      because he knew that she was prompted by a sense of right, and it would
      have been better for her and for him if she had remained firm.
    
    
      She yielded at last, perhaps under bad advice, and suddenly treated Lady
      Castlemaine with such courtesy as to surprise the whole court, King
      Charles included. It is barely possible that her principal reason for this
      concession was a desire to retain the king's support for her native land,
      which was just then greatly needed. Be this as it may, Charles
      misunderstood his wife, and attributed her former refusal to grant his
      request to perversity and hypocrisy, and congratulated himself upon his
      perseverence and decision. This, no doubt, colored his conduct later in

      A.D. 1662.
    
    
      T he New Year
      opened with a series of balls, receptions, and feasts; but poor Catharine
      felt little pleasure in them, for her husband neglected her and spent his
      time in dissipation of the worst character. His associates in vice
      endeavored to justify his treatment of the queen by ridiculing and
      depreciating her in every possible way. They could not appreciate her
      honesty or her piety, so they termed the one lack of brains and the other
      bigotry. Even her personal appearance was caricatured; but although she
      smarted under the stings of these worthless creatures she bore them
      uncomplainingly; no wound rankled in her breast as those inflicted by her
      husband's indifference and undignified behavior.
    
    
      One source of trouble to Catharine during the first year of her marriage
      was poverty. She did not receive half the amount that the marriage treaty
      allowed her, and was forced to practice the most rigid economy to avoid
      falling into debt. This she did so successfully that the financiers of the
      government could not help applauding her for it.
    
    
      When she was ill one summer, her physician recommended the medicinal
      waters of Tunbridge Wells; but neither she nor her officers had any money
      to pay the expenses of such a trip, and it required at least two months
      before it could be raised.
    
    
      A.D. 1663. [207] a
      name="link207" id="link207">Previous to Catharine's departure for the
      wells, she received the good news from her native land that she had
      eagerly hoped for.

      The combined troops of Portugal and England had defeated the Spanish army
      with great loss; and as the battle took place very near Lisbon, it had
      been desperately contested by the Portuguese, while the Queen of England
      awaited the result with breathless anxiety. Colonel Hunt commanded the
      English forces; and when he led them up a steep hill to attack the troops
      under [208]Don
      John of Austria, the Portuguese general exclaimed in ecstasy: "These
      heretics are better to us than all our saints!"
    
    
      Queen Catharine was so ill the following autumn that it was universally
      believed she could not recover. The king repented of his unkindness when
      he thought she was going to die, and passed many hours at her bedside,
      bestowing the most loving attentions upon his sick wife, which had so good
      an effect that she recovered. Her convalescence was very slow, and almost
      before she was pronounced out of danger she was called upon to receive the
      French ambassador and another gentleman from the court of Louis XIV., who
      brought messages of condolence from that monarch on account of the royal
      lady's illness.
    
    
      It seems cruel that Catharine should have been disturbed with such
      ceremonies before she was strong enough to endure them; but we must not
      forget that she lived in an age when privacy was a luxury unknown to
      royalty.
    
    
      When she thought her death was at hand, she made her will, and gave orders
      for many domestic arrangements. Her only requests to the king were, "that
      her body might be sent to Portugal for interment in the tomb of her
      ancestors, and that he would remember the obligation into which he had
      entered, never to separate his interests from those of the king, her
      brother, and to continue his protection to her distressed people." Charles
      promised to obey; but by her recovery his wife spared him the test.
    
    
      In the last reign we told all about the Roundheads, and the origin of
      their name. Of course theirs ceased to be the popular party when the
      Restoration took place; consequently, with a desire to avoid the sneers of
      the courtiers, they adopted wigs, which after awhile became so fashionable
      that even those whose long locks had been a subject of vanity to their
      possessors, had the folly to clip them off

      Original
    
    
      [211]and
      replace them with wigs or periwigs, as they were called. King Charles fell
      in with the prevailing style when he found himself growing gray, likewise
      the Duke of York, whose hair was far too beautiful to be concealed.
    
    
      The necessity for economy that forced itself upon the queen soon begot for
      her the reputation of stinginess, though it was rather a matter of
      prudence than otherwise. She was obliged to save because she seldom
      received her full income. Fortunately, her tastes were simple compared
      with those of her royal spouse; for while her bedroom furniture at
      Whitehall was of the plainest description, the only ornaments being sacred
      pictures and relics, the king's apartments were fitted up with all the
      extravagance and luxury of an Oriental nabob.
    
    
      A.D. 1664. The summer after her recovery, Queen
      Catharine appeared in a silver lace gown, and walked through the park to
      St. James's Chapel, attended by her maids-of-honor, one bright, sunshiny
      morning, all in the same glittering material. Parasols had not then been
      introduced into England, so the courtly dames shaded their faces from the
      bright rays of the sun with gigantic green fans,       a Moorish fashion
      introduced by Catharine of Braganza at her court. Masks were often worn at
      that period to protect the complexion, but they were too warm in summer,
      and the shading fans were by far more comfortable. The trade with India,
      opened to the English by the queen's marriage treaty, filled the fancy
      shops with all sorts of gay and beautiful fans, which were put to another
      use besides that of sunshades. Ladies found them very convenient for
      screens when carrying on a little flirtation; for a whispered conversation
      with a courtier behind one, or a bit of court scandal thus imparted,
      seemed improved by this spicy addition to the secrecy. Addison gives a
      pretty playful description of the use of the fan in several copies of the
      "Spectator," [212] a name="link212"
      id="link212">with which the belles of the present day are no doubt
      familiar.
    
    
      Trade with other countries had increased in England, and her merchants
      were anxious to push it still further; but Holland proved such a
      formidable rival in this matter that, notwithstanding the friendly
      relations that had so long existed between the two countries, Charles saw
      the necessity for preparing his navy for hostilities.
    
    
      Lord Sandwich was ordered to sea, and Queen Catharine was so anxious to
      see the departure of the fleet that she and Queen Henrietta accompanied
      the king to Chatham for that purpose.
    
    
      Shortly after this the Spanish ambassador aroused the queen's indignation
      by demanding the return of Tangier to his government. Of course Charles
      peremptorily refused; and the queen, out of a feeling of spite, pretended
      that she could not speak any language but Portuguese and French when
      addressed by that dignitary. As he knew only his native tongue, she thus
      spared herself the necessity of a prolonged conversation with her enemy.
    
    
      Once, on the occasion of a launch at Woolwich, Catharine played her
      husband a sly trick. She went down from Whitehall with her ladies in her
      barge; but the water was so rough that they were all dreadfully sea-sick,
      excepting herself. The king, the Duke of York, the French ambassador, and
      the attendants went down in carriages by land. After the two parties met
      on ship-board, a violent rain and hail-storm detained them for a long
      time. As soon as it abated, the queen stole ashore with her ladies, took
      possession of the carriages, in which they returned home; leaving all the
      gentlemen to make the best of a very rough trip by water.
    
    
      A.D. 1665. The following year one of England's
      greatest naval victories was won by the fleet under the Duke of York's
      command. [213]The
      rejoicings occasioned thereby were cut short by the breaking out of the
      most terrible visitation of the plague ever known in England. Death,
      sorrow, and poverty spread from house to house, until the exceptions were
      those that did not bear a red cross in token of the existence of disease
      within. The queen-mother quitted the country, and, as the epidemic
      increased, the court was removed to Salisbury.
    
    
      Many people attributed the plague to the appearance of a comet that had
      been observed a few months before. We of the present day laugh at such an
      absurd superstition; but in the seventeenth century a visit from one of
      those heavenly bodies was always contemplated with awe by the ignorant,
      who were unfortunately in the majority. King Charles was not of the
      number, for he had a taste for astronomy, and was delighted to have an
      opportunity of studying the comet in its different phases. For this
      purpose he spent several nights at the observatory at Greenwich, a
      building that he had founded, and Queen Catharine stayed with him twice
      until she saw the curiosity also. She was not gratified the first time,
      because astronomical calculations were not so accurate as they are at
      present.
    
    
      The king opened parliament in the autumn, when they voted him supplies to
      carry on the Dutch war, which he greatly needed; for he was at that time
      paying a thousand pounds weekly out of his own private purse to relieve
      the sufferings caused by the plague.
    
    
      A.Dr 1666. The following year opened sadly for
      Catharine, because it brought news of the death of her beloved mother, the
      Queen-regent of Portugal. All the court put on the deepest mourning, and
      were directed "to wear their hair plain, and to appear without spots on
      their faces." This referred to the patches of black plaster that
      disfigured the court ladies of that period. A few months later Catharine
      [214]removed
      with her ladies to Tunbridge Wells again for the summer. This was a
      favorite resort for the fashionables during the seventeenth century, Queen
      Catharine having made it so by her patronage. There, under the shadow of
      spreading trees, the gay company would promenade in the morning while
      drinking of the waters. On one side of the avenue, formed by the trees,
      were little shops filled with toys and all sorts of fancy articles; on the
      other was a market. Neat-looking cottages, built here and there over a
      mile and a half of ground that surrounded the wells, formed the
      dwelling-places of the visitors, who would assemble on the green in the
      evening just before sunset for a dance. After dark they would adjourn to
      the queen's palace, where all sorts of amusements were indulged in for
      several hours. Catharine dispensed with ceremony at this watering-place,
      and endeavored to enhance the enjoyment of everybody by so doing. As a
      surprise to the king she sent for some actors, who performed comedies for
      the entertainment of the court. One member of this company was the
      celebrated Nell Gwynne, a beautiful actress, who afterwards became a lady
      of the queen's bed-chamber.
    
    
      While the king and queen, surrounded by their court, were thus engaged
      making pleasure the business of their lives, the aspect of public affairs
      was most gloomy. The poverty caused by the ravages of the plague had
      rendered it impossible to collect taxes, consequently the supplies voted
      by parliament for the carrying on of the war were not forthcoming. France
      had formed an alliance with Holland, and England was at war with both
      powers. Added to these troubles was this: the country was filled with
      hirelings of exiled Roundheads, who, while pretending to be patriots, were
      really spies, dishonorably intriguing to raise an insurrection in England.
    
    
      On the second of September a fire broke out in a baker

      [217]shop,
      at the corner of Thames street, and spread with frightful rapidity. It
      raged for four days, and the air was filled with the shrieks and
      lamentations of the men, women, and children, who rushed from one place to
      another after being obliged to desert their homes, knowing not whither to
      turn in order to save themselves from the devouring flames and the
      tottering churches and dwellings. The king and the Duke of York worked
      with the firemen, commanding, encouraging, and rewarding them; and it was
      the presence of mind of the latter that stopped the fire at last, by
      blowing up several houses. This precaution saved the old Temple Church,
      the Tower, and Westminster Abbey. It was in seasons of danger and disaster
      that King Charles II. always appeared to the greatest advantage, by
      displaying a paternal care for the welfare of his subjects. After the fire
      he caused tents and huts to be erected in the vicinity of London for those
      who were left homeless, and provided them with food and fuel. He was,
      besides, remarkably lenient to those who could not pay taxes, because of
      the poverty occasioned by the plague, though he was thereby deprived of
      the means to pay his seamen, and obliged to order the ships to lay-by.
    
    
      If Charles had been as faithful to his wife as he was to his subjects she
      would have been a very happy woman; but about this time he was imitating
      Henry VIII. by contemplating a divorce, because he had fallen in love with
      Frances Stuart, a maid-of-honor, and one of the most beautiful women of
      her day. This was a cause of great anxiety to the queen, but fortunately
      not for a long time, because her rival married the Duke of Richmond and
      went to Denmark to live. That put an end to the divorce question; but Lord
      Clarendon brought down the king's vengeance on his head by favoring
      Frances Stuart's marriage, and even using his efforts to bring it about.
      Charles never forgave his chancellor for that offence.
    
    
      [A.D. 1667.] [218] a name="link218"
      id="link218">Shortly after this marriage there was a masked ball at
      court, at which the king and queen danced together. On St. George's Day
      Charles celebrated the festival of the Garter with all the ceremonies as
      they were originally observed when that order was founded. Offerings were
      made at the altar by the sovereign and his knights, after which they
      partook of a feast at the Palace of Whitehall. The king sat at a table on
      a dais alone, and part of the time the queen stood at his left hand as a
      spectator. The knights sat at a table ranged the whole length of the room
      to the right of the king, and at the middle of the feast they all arose
      and drank his health, whereupon the trumpets sounded and the Tower guns
      were fired. At the conclusion of the feast all the provisions that were
      left over were distributed among the crowd, that always assembled at the
      end of the hall, near the door, on such occasions. It was the custom in
      olden times, even to the end of the Stuart dynasty, for the kings and
      queens of England to dine in public; and any well-behaved, decent-looking
      person was free to take his stand in the dining-room to watch the
      proceedings. Charles II. was so good-natured that he would often hand a
      taste of some delicacy to one of the spectators on such an occasion, and
      won many hearts by his gracious manners. He would converse freely, too,
      with those who happened to stand near enough. A well-known wit told him
      one day while he was dining "that matters were in a bad state, but there
      was a way to mend all." The king looked at him inquiringly, and he
      continued: "There is an honest, able man I could name, that if your
      majesty would employ and command to see things well-executed, all things
      would soon be mended, and that is one Charles Stuart, who now spends his
      time as if he had no employment; but if you would give him employment, he
      were the fittest man in the world to perform it." [219] a
      name="link219" id="link219">After Lord Clarendon fell into disfavor
      with the king, he was replaced by Buckingham, a very bad, witty man, who
      had great influence with Charles. He was an enemy to Catharine, and
      proposed to his sovereign several plans for ridding himself of her; but
      they were all too absurd and too revolting for even Charles II. to
      consider, unprincipled as he was.
    
    
      A.D. 1668. Seven years had elapsed since the
      marriage of Catharine of Braganza, and still the promised half of her
      marriage-portion had not been paid. Civil wars in Portugal succeeded the
      death of the queen-regent and exhausted the treasury. At last news arrived
      in England that the king had been deposed, and his younger brother, Don
      Pedro, placed on the throne instead. Everything connected with her family
      and her native land interested Queen Catharine very much, and it
      distressed her to hear of the struggle that had been going on there for so
      many months.
    
    
      A.D. 1669. The king sympathized with her and
      treated her with a great deal of consideration in her anxiety. She had an
      opportunity of reciprocating not very long after; for Henrietta, the
      Duchess of Orleans, made a short visit at the English court, and died
      three weeks after her return to France. She and Catharine then met for the
      first time, and formed a warm attachment for each other; so her death was
      a source of real sorrow to the queen. Charles gave vent to the most
      passionate grief when he heard the startling news, for he was warmly
      attached to his only sister, who had befriended him during his exile.
    
    
      After the court took off mourning for the Duchess of Orleans, Queen
      Catharine indulged her fondness for dancing by giving balls and
      masquerades; the latter becoming so much the rage as to resemble in some
      respects a carnival.
    
    
      Separate parties would be formed by the king and queen,  span
      class="pagenum">[220]with the
      ladies and gentlemen of the court; and so disguised as not to be
      recognized by their most intimate friends, they would go about in search
      of adventure. On such occasions they would enter any house where a party
      was going on, mingle with the invited guests, and commit some of the
      wildest pranks imaginable, only taking care that their rank should not be
      suspected. Once the queen got separated from her party, and by some
      mistake was left quite alone. She was a long way from home, and did not
      dare to announce who she was. In great alarm she stood in the street until
      a hack came along, when she summoned it and was driven to Whitehall.
      Whether or no she took the driver into her confidence has not been
      recorded.
    
    
      During such escapades, of course, both their majesties were subjected to
      liberties from their subjects, which they bore most good naturedly. The
      king, especially, seldom resented even the most caustic sarcasms from his
      courtiers, though he generally returned a spicy repartee.
    
    
      The Earl of Rochester once wrote upon Charles's chamber door:       
    
    
      
    
    
      "Here lies our sovereign lord the king,
    
    
      Whose word no man relies on;
    
    
      Who never said a foolish thing,
    
    
      And never did a wise one."
    
    
      
    
    
      "Very true," returned King Charles, after reading the lines. "My doings
      are those of my ministers, but my sayings are my own."
    
    
      A.D. 1671. Once when Queen Catharine was at her
      palace in Suffolk, with her court, she determined to have a little frolic;
      and for that purpose took the Duchesses of Richmond and Buckingham into
      her confidence. This was her plan: A fair was being held at the
      neighboring town of Saffron Walden, and there her majesty meant to go in
      disguise. So the three ladies dressed themselves like
    
    
      [221]
    
    
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Original
    
    
      [223]country
      girls, in short, red petticoats, intending to mingle with the crowd,
      fondly hoping that they would not be recognized. Catharine was sensible
      enough to select for her cavalier Sir Bernard Gascoigne, a brave old
      gentleman, loved and respected by all who knew him; and a warm personal
      friend to the king. Mounted behind this cavalier, on an old cart-horse,
      and followed by the other ladies, each riding in the same primitive
      fashion with her escort, the party set out. But they had copied their
      costumes, not from those of the peasants, but from the representation of
      them at the theatres. So as soon as they arrived on the fair-grounds they
      were mistaken for a company of strolling players; and supposing that they
      would soon begin to perform, the rustics followed them in crowds. When the
      queen entered one of the booths to buy "a pair of yellow stockings for her
      beau," a man who had seen her at one of the public state dinners
      recognized her, and, proud of his superior knowledge, announced his
      sovereign's presence at once. The information spread like wildfire, and
      the court party returned home, followed by a motley crowd.
    
    
      The same year the king and queen made a tour through several counties, and
      were sumptuously entertained. At its conclusion, Catharine remained
      quietly at Euston Hall, in Suffolk, with her ladies, while the king
      attended the Newmarket races, attended by his lively courtiers.
    
    
      A.D. 1677. The marriage of the king's nephew,
      William, Prince of Orange, with Princess Mary, eldest daughter of the Duke
      of York, was celebrated at Whitehall in November; and as the anniversary
      of the queen's birth occurred the same month, there was occasion for
      double rejoicing. Catharine had known the young princess almost from the
      day of her birth, and felt a warm attachment for the motherless girl.
    
    
      When the time came for her departure for Holland with [224] a
      name="link224" id="link224">her husband, she fell on the queen's
      breast and burst into tears.
    
    
      Catharine endeavored to soothe her by recounting her own experience in
      having come to England a perfect stranger, without even having seen the
      man she was to marry.
    
    
      But Mary thought no sorrow could equal hers; and replied, between her
      sobs: "Yes; but, madam, you came into England, and I am leaving England."
    
    
      If she could have looked into the aching heart of the woman who was
      offering words of comfort scarcely needed she would have been awed into
      silence. Poor Catharine's position at that period was worse than ever
      before. The Earl of Shaftesbury, an ambitious, revengeful, dishonorable
      man, was her avowed enemy, and bent upon her destruction; so he had
      influenced the king to absent himself from her in the hope that time and
      separation would at last induce him to consent to a divorce. He was not
      successful in this; but he was so in bringing about the popish plot, his
      intention being to destroy the queen and rob the Duke of York, whom he
      hated also, of his right of succession.
    
    
      We do not intend to give all the details of this wicked plot; but it
      played such an important part of Queen Catharine's life that we will, in
      as few words as possible, explain the nature of it. We must go back to a
      year or two after her marriage, for it was then that Catharine made a
      serious mistake, which caused her name to be connected with this plot
      nearly fifteen years later. Catharine's anxiety to have the independence
      of Portugal acknowledged by the pope was so great that soon after she got
      to England she induced her husband to send Richard Bellings, one of the
      gentlemen of her household, on a mission to Rome. The object was to
      promise his holiness that if he [225] a
      name="link225" id="link225">would extend his protection to her native
      land she would use her utmost endeavors to advance the Catholic cause in
      England; adding that her desire to accomplish this had been the sole cause
      of her marriage. Letters of the same purport were sent to several of the
      cardinals also. Her appeal had the desired effect; but Bellings let out
      the secret, and the vigilant enemies of Queen Catharine made a note of it,
      to be used against her when opportunity offered.
    
    
      A.D. 1678. Titus Oates and Bedloe were the
      infamous characters selected to swear away the lives of a large number of
      innocent persons.
    
    
      Oates was the son of a weaver and preacher, and a villain of the deepest
      dye. If he had not been so brainless as to swear to a tissue of falsehoods
      too palpable to gain credence, rivers of blood would have been shed, and
      the disgraceful scenes that attended the St. Bartholomew massacre in
      France would have been repeated in England. But when the king questioned
      him and Bedloe, their statements as to the place and manner that the queen
      had used for declaring her intention of poisoning his majesty were so
      absurd that they stood self-convicted.
    
    
      King Charles never for a moment suspected his wife of any attempt on his
      life; and he knew, besides, that although the Duke of York, his brother,
      had become a member of the Catholic church, it had not been through her
      instrumentality.
    
    
      But the public mind was aroused to such a pitch by the daily inventions of
      Oates and his adherents that the business of life was interrupted, and the
      wildest statements were eagerly accepted as indisputable facts.
    
    
      Catharine was even accused of having caused the murder of Godfrey, a city
      magistrate, whose body was found on the highway, pierced with his own
      sword. [226]It
      was Shaftesbury who prompted Oates in all he said and did, though he was
      wily enough to keep himself in the background. It was he who secured from
      parliament, for the shameless perjurer, a pension of twelve hundred pounds
      a year for the information he had given, in consequence of which all the
      Roman Catholic peers were deprived of their seats in that body.
    
    
      All this time Queen Catharine was surrounded by spies, ready to pounce
      upon any action of hers that might be perverted into an appearance of
      guilt; but her honesty and simplicity of character spoke so loudly in her
      favor that there was not a true-hearted man in the realm who was not
      assured of her entire innocence.
    
    
      But she was aware of her danger, and expected nothing less than that she
      would be brought to the block, as Charles I. had been. She, therefore,
      sent a messenger, to her brother, Don Pedro, informing him of her
      situation, and asking his protection in case her life should be in
      jeopardy. Her adviser was Count Castelmelhor, a noble Portuguese exile,
      who proved of such service to Queen Catharine that she helped him to
      retrieve his lost fortune by purchasing a new estate for him, to which he
      gave the name of Santa Catarina, out of compliment to her.
    
    
      King Charles offered five hundred pounds for the murderer of Godfrey.
      Tempted by so large a sum, Bedloe, Oates's colleague, and a discharged
      convict, swore that the deed had been done by the queen's popish servants;
      and that he had been offered two thousand guineas to assist in the removal
      of the body, which he saw lying on the queen's back stairs. When
      cross-examined, this rascal contradicted himself, and described the
      portion of the palace where he beheld the corpse so inaccurately as to
      prove conclusively that he had never been in it at all.
    
    
      The members of the house of commons were paralyzed [227] a
      name="link227" id="link227">with astonishment at their next session,
      when Oates advanced to the bar, and, raising his voice, exclaimed: "I,
      Titus Oates, accuse Catharine, Queen of England, of high treason."
    
    
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Original
    
    
      His partners in villany, taking advantage of those present, who were so
      surprised as to remain speechless, voted an address to the king,
      requesting the removal of his wife to the Tower. But the lords refused to
      admit the testimony of such men as Oates and Bedloe, so appointed a
      committee to investigate the charges brought against her majesty.
      Shaftesbury protested, but he was overruled.
    
    
      King Charles was perfectly conscious of a conspiracy against his wife, and
      vowed that he would not suffer her to be wronged. His indignation was so
      great that he began to treat her with such affection and respect as she
      had not known for many a day at his hands. He had Oates arrested, but was
      obliged to release him; and then the man [228] a
      name="link228" id="link228">went beyond all bounds. Five Catholic
      lords were sent to the Tower on account of his accusations against them;
      thirty thousand Catholics were driven out of London from terror, and
      arrests and executions were of daily occurrence.
    
    
      A.D. 1679. Some of the queen's servants were of
      the number, much to her horror and grief, and the Duke of York frequently
      assured her that his turn and hers would come next. Although the king
      feared the popular rage, he absolutely refused to permit the queen to
      stand a trial when his privy-council proposed it, because he knew it would
      not be a fair one. Shortly after he went to Newmarket with the queen, and
      while they were there Bedloe died. In his last confession he swore that so
      far as he knew both the queen and the Duke of York were innocent of any
      attempt on the king's life, or of any murder whatever, and that all the
      evidence he had formerly given was false.
    
    
      A.D. 1680. The popish plot closed with the
      execution of Lord Stafford, a tragedy that ought not to have taken place.
      But we have one more circumstance to relate, an anti-climax to the popish
      plot. One Fitzharris appeared upon the scene, and accused the queen and
      the Duke of York of a design to poison the king.
    
    
      Charles immediately summoned parliament to meet at Oxford, March 21.
      Escorted by a troop of horse-guards, and accompanied by the queen, he
      proceeded to the appointed place, where the royal couple were greeted with
      enthusiasm by the students of the university, who made addresses of
      welcome, while the authorities prepared a feast and other rejoicings.
      Shaftesbury arrived with his party and a crowd of armed retainers, who
      wore hatbands with the inscription, "No popery! No slavery!"
    
    
      King Charles's first parliament sat for eighteen years, and was called the
      long parliament; this one was to sit for six [229] a
      name="link229" id="link229">days, and ought therefore to have been
      styled the short parliament. Fitzharris was a member of the church of
      Rome, and great results were anticipated from his statements. The house of
      commons wanted the trial managed one way, the lords another, and a furious
      dispute arose. So, without mentioning his intention to a soul, the king
      had himself carried in a closely-curtained sedan chair to the house. He
      wore his robes of state and carried his crown concealed on his lap. He
      entered the house of lords unannounced, took his seat on the throne,
      placed the crown upon his head, and bade the usher summon the commons. The
      moment they entered he told them "that proceedings which began so ill
      could not end in good," and commanded the lord chancellor to declare
      parliament dissolved. Before they had time to recover from their
      astonishment, the king and queen were on the road to Windsor, escorted by
      their guard.
    
    
      If Charles had displayed the same determination and courage at the
      beginning of the popish plot, how much innocent blood might have been
      spared, and what misery prevented! Fitzharris was tried for treason and
      executed.
    
    
      A.D. 1683. About three years after the popish
      plot another was formed by some minor conspirators, their object being to
      kill both the king and the Duke of York, his brother; but Providence
      interposed to prevent such a foul murder before the plans of the
      conspirators had been completed. The Duke of Monmouth revealed the plot,
      which brought several prominent men to the block.
    
    
      A.D. 1684. It was so cold the following winter
      that the Thames was frozen over, and an ox was roasted whole in a fire
      built on the ice. This was done while a fair was being held; the booths
      for the purpose were stationed along the banks of the river, and there was
      a great deal of merrymaking, though the winter was a hard one for poor
      people, because provisions were so high and fuel so scarce.  span

      The queen's birthday that year was celebrated with great splendor, and
      there was the finest display of fireworks in front of the palace ever seen
      in England. The same night there was a grand ball, at which all the court
      ladies and gentlemen danced in costumes that were unusually rich and
      elegant.
    
    
      A.D. 1685. [231] a
      name="link231" id="link231">This was the last entertainment that King
      Charles ever attended, for on the second of February of the following year
      he had an attack' of apoplexy that resulted in death four days later. He
      was bled until he was almost exhausted, and then his bedroom was so
      crowded with people, night and day, that he had little chance of recovery.
      Most of the time it contained five bishops, twenty-five lords, the
      councillors, foreign ambassadors, doctors, and attendants, besides the
      queen, and the Duke and Duchess of York.
    
    
      The queen was overcome with grief, and once when the dying man sent for
      her she was too convulsed to attend, but sent a messenger to beg his
      pardon if ever she had offended him. "Alas, poor lady!" exclaimed Charles,
      "she begs my pardon! I beg hers with all my heart." After that she took
      her place at his bedside and stayed with him to the end.
    
    
      Both the Duke of York and Catharine were exceedingly anxious that the king
      should receive the last rites of the Catholic church, because they knew it
      was what he would prefer if he were conscious of his danger, but they
      dared not propose it, as it was contrary to the laws of England for any
      one to influence another in that direction. At last the French ambassador
      consulted the Duke of York on the subject, and impressed upon him the
      necessity of having extreme unction administered before it was too late.
    
    
      Returning to his brother's room, the duke knelt by the bed and asked in a
      low voice: "Sir, will you receive the sacrament of the Catholic church?"
    
    
      "Ah! I would give anything in the world to have a priest," faintly replied
      the dying monarch. "I will bring you one," returned the duke. "For God's
      sake, brother, do!" exclaimed the king. Then he added: "But will you not
      expose yourself to danger by doing it?" [232] a
      name="link232" id="link232">"Sir, though it cost me my life, I will
      bring you one," said the duke.
    
    
      Father Huddleston was selected, because for many reasons he was the least
      objectionable of the Catholic priests in England, and had for many years
      been a personal friend to the king, whose life he had once saved. He
      arrived between seven and eight o'clock on the evening of the fifth. Now
      it became necessary to clear the sick-room of those who would have
      objected to the performance of the Catholic rites; the Duke of York
      managed the difficult matter in this way:       
    
    
      Kneeling down by his dying brother he whispered "that all things were
      ready and Father Huddleston in attendance, and asked if he would see him?"
    
    
      "Yes, with all my heart!" eagerly replied Charles, in a loud voice.
    
    
      Turning to the room-full of people, the duke said:
    
    
      "Gentlemen, his majesty wishes every one to withdraw but the Earls of Bath
      and Feversham."
    
    
      Then Father Huddleston, disguised in a wig and cassock, such as the clergy
      of the Church of England always wore, was led up a secret staircase,
      through the queen's apartments, into the king's room.
    
    
      As he entered the alcove in which stood the king's bed, the duke presented
      him, saying: "Sir, I bring you a man who once saved your life; he now
      comes to save your soul."
    
    
      Charles replied, in a weak voice, "He is welcome."
    
    
      At the conclusion of the Romish rites the company were readmitted; and
      Kean, an English minister, prayed with the king.
    
    
      During the night the dying man spoke affectionately to his brother, and
      asked forgiveness of his wife. At six in the morning he asked the time,
      and said: "Draw the cur-

      tain, [235]and
      open the window, that I may behold the light of the sun for the last
      time."
    
    
      Before noon Charles II. expired, in the fifty-fourth year of his age. He
      was buried on the fourteenth of February, at Westminster Abbey, after
      lying in state for a week. He was deeply mourned by his subjects; for no
      sovereign ever had the attributes of popularity more fully developed than
      King Charles II.
    
    
      Queen Catharine's grief on account of the death of her husband was great.
      The new king treated her with kindness and consideration. She was
      permitted to retain her rooms at Whitehall as long as she chose; but on
      the eighth of April, after two months of mourning, she removed to Somerset
      House, where she established her court as queen-dowager.
    
    
      Catharine no longer danced or took part in gayety of any kind; but she
      indulged her love for music by giving regular concerts at Somerset House.
    
    
      A.D. 1688-9. Several times she made up her mind
      to return to her native land, but fortunately did not do so; for if she
      had she would have lost every penny of her dower as queen-dowager during
      the Revolution, which terminated in the exile of James II. and his family,
      and the placing of the Prince of Orange on the throne of England. She
      wisely weathered the storm, although she was subjected to many
      mortifications and insults in consequence.
    
    
      After William III. was on the throne he had occasion to go to Ireland; so
      before departing he sent Lord Nottingham to tell Catharine that he had
      heard of certain meetings, held at Somerset House, for the purpose of
      denouncing his government; he therefore desired her to remove either to
      Windsor or Audley End.
    
    
      Astonished at such a message, but not in the least alarmed, she replied:
      "That it was her desire to quit his [236] a
      name="link236" id="link236">territory for Portugal, if he would but
      have appointed ships for her voyage; but, as it was, she did not intend to
      go out of her own house."
    
    
      The next day William sent profuse apologies, and bade the queen "not to
      think of removing."
    
    
      A.D. 1692. A few months later the royal widow
      gave notice of her intention to leave England; but it was not until the
      spring of 1692 that she was able to carry it into effect. She had then
      been living in retirement for several years, and had saved a large sum of
      money to carry back to Portugal.
    
    
      Several English ladies of rank attended her; and as soon as Louis XIV.
      heard of her arrival in France he sent an escort to conduct her through
      his dominion. But she was so anxious to get to her native land that she
      would not accept the invitation he extended her to visit his court.
    
    
      Queen Catharine was met on the Spanish border by a train of Portuguese
      nobles of the highest rank; and on her arrival at Lisbon she was greeted
      with the most enthusiastic welcome.
    
    
      Don Pedro met her on the road in grand state. He descended from his
      carriage and went to the door of hers; then, after an affectionate
      embrace, the queen alighted, entered her brother's coach, and was
      conducted in procession to one of the country palaces that had been
      prepared for her. The Queen of Portugal, Donna Maria Sophia, received her
      at the head of the grand staircase, and after the observance of all the
      regular court ceremonies, went home with her husband, to enable the tired
      traveller to rest.
    
    
      [A.D. 1704.] When Don Pedro was obliged some years later, for the sake of
      policy, to withdraw from the cares of government, he left the charge of
      his dominions entirely [237] a name="link237"
      id="link237">his sister Catharine, and when he was dangerously ill the
      following year, she was solemnly constituted Queen-regent of Portugal.
    
    
      A.D. 1705. The country was then engaged in a war
      with the King of Spain, and "Donna Catharine" conducted the campaign with
      such skill that her popularity increased tenfold.
    
    
      A sudden attack of colic [Likely Appendicitis. DW] put an end to her
      existence the very last day of the year that had been such a brilliant
      success to her. The king, her brother, hastened to her as soon as he heard
      of her illness, but arrived only an hour before she expired.
    
    
      Queen Catharine left liberal legacies to all her relations, though Don
      Pedro was her heir. The poor were not forgotten, and various monasteries
      were provided for by her will. She had chosen the royal monastery of Belem
      for the place of her interment, and the funeral ceremony was performed
      with all the grandeur and solemnity that would have been observed if
      Catharine of Braganza had been a reigning sovereign. Her bier was carried
      by eight noblemen of the very highest rank to the litter, on which it was
      conveyed to Belem, attended by all her retinue, and by the whole court of
      the king, her brother.
    
    
      As a testimony of respect all public buildings, business-houses, and
      places of amusement were closed for a week, and the court wore mourning
      for a year.
    
    
      Catharine was greatly lamented in Portugal, where even to the present day
      her name is mentioned with the utmost veneration. She outlived Charles II.
      twenty-one years, and was devoted to his memory until she died.  span

      CHAPTER IX. MARY BEATRICE OF MODENA, QUEEN-CONSORT OF JAMES II.
    
    
      (A.D. 1659-1718.)
    
    
      The city of Modena
      in Italy was the birthplace of some of the greatest poets and painters of
      that land of artists, and it was there that the heroine of this narrative
      was born. Her father, the Duke of Modena, was a learned man, and would
      probably have made his mark in the world if he had lived long enough; but
      he died young, and left his Duchess Laura to rule in his stead.
    
    
      This lady had two little children, a boy, who later became Francis II. of
      Modena, and Mary Beatrice. Prince Rinaldo d'Esté, afterwards a cardinal,
      was appointed guardian of the children, and assisted their mother in
      educating them.
    
    
      Francisco, as the boy was called during his minority, was two years
      younger than his sister, consequently when his father died the duchess
      ruled the state many years before he was fit to do so.
    
    
      She was rather a stern mother,       her fear, lest overindulgence might
      spoil her little ones, making her notice trifling faults that in some
      instances it would have been wiser to have overlooked. She insisted upon
      hard study several hours every day, and never allowed any of the fasts
      imposed by the church to be omitted, though both the children were
      delicate. When Mary Beatrice was frightened at seeing a chimney-sweep
      descend into her nursery through the fireplace, her mother made the man
      remain until she had shown the child who he was, and explained
    
    
      [239]
    
    
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Original
    
    
      [241]Why
      he looked so black and dirty. On one occasion the attention of the
      duchess-regent was drawn to the fact that hard study was wearing upon the
      young duke's health. "Better that I should have no son, than a son without
      wit and merit," replied the parent.
    
    
      A.D. 1666. Mary's first real sorrow was when her
      governess, of whom she was very fond, entered a convent, and she grieved
      so sorely that she was sent to the same institution to finish her
      education. There she spent several happy years; for the discipline was
      much less rigid than it had been at the palace, and she had the
      companionship of girls of her own age. The books that were placed in her
      hands, and the influence by which Mary was surrounded at the convent,
      filled her youthful mind with mystic romance, and gave her a desire to
      imitate the female saints whose lives had been devoted to the service of
      God. Besides, she had an aunt in the convent, scarcely fifteen years older
      than herself, who was preparing to take the veil, and Mary Beatrice loved
      her so much that she desired to follow her example. But she was not to
      lead a life of peace and repose: a different destiny awaited her, as we
      shall see.
    
    
      James, Duke of York, was brother to Charles II., and the second son of
      Henrietta Maria and Charles I. of Great Britain. He was a gifted engineer,
      and for many years occupied the post of Lord Admiral of England, when he
      established colonies in different parts of the world, and advanced trade
      with foreign countries. After being a prisoner in his native land for many
      months, during the struggles of his father's reign, the duke made his
      escape to Holland and shared his brother's exile, never returning to
      England until the time of the restoration. While his mother was living in
      France he entered the army of that country as a volunteer, and fought so
      valiantly for the royalist cause that the French commander said: "If any
      man in [242]the
      world was born without fear it was the Duke of York."
    
    
      There is a portrait of this prince in the royal gallery at Versailles,
      painted when he was about twenty-two years old, which represents him as
      one of the handsomest men of his time. His brown hair is brushed from his
      brow and falls in ringlets at the back; his eyes are large, dark, and
      expressive, lips full and red, complexion warm and healthful. This picture
      was painted before he had the small-pox, for that dreadful disease made a
      sad alteration in his appearance later in life.
    
    
      The Duke of York distinguished himself on the battlefields of Spain after
      he was driven from France, where he had served in four campaigns, and was
      offered a very high position. He would not accept, because he was always
      expecting affairs to take such a shape in his native land as to permit his
      return..
    
    
      A.D. 1660. Shortly after that important change
      did occur,       the restoration of Charles II.,       the duke fell in
      love with Anne Hyde, daughter of Clarendon, and married her in spite of a
      great deal of opposition on all sides.
    
    
      A.D. 1667. By the time he was thirty-four years
      of age his wife and several of his children were dead. Two daughters were
      spared, who caused their father much bitter sorrow, as we shall see in the
      course of this biography. About seven years after the death of his wife
      the Duke of York fell in love with a lady of humble birth; but his
      brother, the king, put a stop to any thought of marriage with her, and
      sent the Earl of Peterborough to visit the different princesses of Europe
      and select for James a wife whose station in life would be equal to his
      own.
    
    
      A.D. 1673. The ambassador's choice fell on Marv
      Beatrice of Modena, whom he was enabled to see through the convent grating
      by the good offices of a priest. The [243] a
      name="link243" id="link243">duke had secretly charged Peterborough to
      be very careful in his selection, and to give him a faithful description
      of the lady he preferred before settling anything.
    
    
      Now, it must not be supposed that the ambassador made his choice without a
      great many annoyances, for he had to visit several courts, and as the
      object of his trip was suspected, he was placed in very embarrassing
      positions when the particular princess he was considering did not possess
      the requirements he deemed indispensable. And even after he had decided
      that Mary Beatrice of Modena should have the honor of becoming Queen of
      England, his trouble was not at an end by any means; for the young lady
      had planned a different sort of life for herself, and objected very
      decidedly to the lofty position now offered to her.
    
    
      The Earl of Peterborough intended to proceed very cautiously, and not to
      make known his errand until he was quite sure of success. He therefore
      lodged himself at an inn like an ordinary traveller; but the second
      morning after his arrival a man named Nardi presented himself with a
      letter from the duchess-regent. The earl's surprise at being so honored
      was increased when he read what the lady wrote. It was, that having heard
      the object of his journey to Italy, she deemed it her duty to inform him
      that her daughter had resolved to become a nun, but added that there were
      other princesses in her family, to one of whom, if the duke, his master,
      thought fit, he might be permitted to address himself. She sent also a
      cordial invitation for the ambassador to come to court "where she should
      deem it an honor to welcome him." The earl was not flattered at the
      anxiety displayed by the duchess to refuse him her daughter before he had
      made his offer, so he pretended that his visit had no special object, but
      that he was a private traveller, with no desire to interfere with
      anybody's plans. This was only a little stratagem on the part of the  span
      class="pagenum">[244]duchess;
      for she was dazzled with the thought of her daughter becoming the wife of
      the heir presumptive to the throne of England, but thought it best not to
      appear overanxious. However, she took the precaution to speak to Mary
      Beatrice on the subject at a very early stage of the proceedings.
    
    
      Mary Beatrice was less than fifteen, but she was tall, womanly, and very
      beautiful, with hair, eyes and eyebrows black as jet, and a clear olive
      complexion. She read and wrote Latin and French, painted well, and was an
      excellent musician, but of history and geography she was thoroughly
      ignorant. When her mother announced that the Duke of York desired to marry
      her, she asked: "Who is the Duke of York?" and upon being told that he was
      brother to the King of England, whom he would succeed to the crown, she
      replied: "That she had never heard of such a place as England, nor of such
      a person as the Duke of York." The duchess explained more fully, and
      casually mentioned that the duke was in his fortieth year; then Mary
      Beatrice burst into tears and implored her aunt to marry him instead,
      saying "that as she was thirty years of age she was more fit to become the
      wife of a man of forty than she herself was, being only fifteen." No
      amount of persuasion could reconcile her to the thought of marrying a man
      twenty-five years her senior, and she declared her determination to become
      a nun. So eloquently did she plead her own cause that her uncle and her
      mother's prime minister were won over, and encouraged the princess in her
      refusal to marry.
    
    
      Meanwhile a messenger arrived from England to inform the earl that the
      Marquis of Dangeau had been despatched from France to assist in concluding
      the matrimonial alliance between England and Modena, adding that it was
      suspected that an aunt was to be substituted for the young princess,  span
      class="pagenum">[245]but that
      she was quite unsuitable to the Duke of York, therefore no such exchange
      was to be permitted.
    
    
      A week later the marquis arrived and had an interview with the duchess. He
      pointed out to her the advantages of such a powerful ally as England, and
      assured her that the King of France had requested him to use his utmost
      influence to forward the marriage. His eloquence prevailed with the
      duchess, the court, and council; but the prime minister, Father Garimbert,
      remained firm, and continued to espouse the side of the young princess.
    
    
      The duchess then sent for the Earl of Peterborough, and informed him of
      the change in her determination. The next consideration was, to obtain a
      dispensation from the pope, because the Duke of York had not openly avowed
      himself a Catholic. The Abbé Dangeau, brother to the marquis, was sent to
      Rome for that purpose, and while he was gone the duchess sent for the Earl
      of Peterborough, and after making profuse apologies, explained why she had
      regarded the proposed alliance with so much disfavor at first, her
      principal reason being the desire of the princess to enter a convent. The
      earl expressed a wish to see Mary Beatrice that evening, and was conducted
      to the palace at the appointed hour for that purpose.
    
    
      He approached the young girl with great formality, and told her that he
      must ask her pardon for desiring her to leave her peaceful retreat; but as
      soon as he saw her portrait he knew that she was the woman, of all others,
      to make his prince happy, and that since he had seen her he was more
      convinced of it than before. She answered crossly, "that she was obliged
      to the King of England and the Duke of York for their good opinion of her,
      but she had vowed herself for another sort of life than marriage;" then
      with tears in her eyes she desired his excellency, "if he had any
      influence with his master, to oblige [246] a
      name="link246" id="link246">her by endeavoring to avert any further
      persecutions of a maid who did not wish to marry." She added: "That there
      were other princesses in Italy, even in her own family, who would not be
      unworthy of so great an honor, and who deserved it much better than she
      did."
    
    
      She referred to her aunt, but the earl pretended not to understand, and
      continued to urge his suit. Mary Beatrice spoke her mind as a petulant
      girl of fifteen is apt to do, and then left the room with her mother.
    
    
      The ambassador complained of her behavior to one of the ministers, who
      told him that the ladies of Italy had no will but that of their friends,
      therefore he need give himself no concern about the matter. Acting upon
      this hint, the earl reminded the minister that everything must be settled
      before the next meeting of parliament, because they would object to the
      marriage of the duke with a Catholic princess.
    
    
      The dispensation had been refused at Rome, but in spite of that and of the
      tears and lamentations of Mary Beatrice the marriage treaty was soon
      completed. The Bishop of Modena refused to perform the ceremony; but
      White, a poor English minister, who had no fear of excommunication,
      undertook it.
    
    
      The marriage portion amounted to eighty thousand pounds, to be paid at
      different periods, part of it being furnished by Louis IV., who had always
      treated Mary Beatrice as his adopted daughter.
    
    
      A.D. 1674. The ceremony was performed on the
      thirtieth of September, the Earl of Peterborough, who acted as proxy for
      the Duke of York, placing a valuable diamond ring on the bride's finger.
      Afterwards there was a grand banquet, and the earl sat under a canopy at
      the head of the table with the bride, now called her royal highness the
      Duchess of York. In the evening there was

      Original
    
    
      [249]dancing,
      and everybody seemed happy excepting the bride, whose heart was very heavy
      at the thought of so soon leaving the home and companions of her
      childhood. She had struggled with all her might against destiny, and had
      made the most determined efforts to preserve her freedom, all of no avail.
      She had been led to the altar like a lamb to the sacrifice, and her lips
      had pronounced the vows from which her soul had shrunken.
    
    
      When the news reached the Duke of York that the ceremony had been
      performed, he was talking to a circle of friends in the drawing-room.
      "Then I am a married man!" he exclaimed, and that night sent word to his
      daughter, Mary "that he had provided a playfellow for her."
    
    
      The duke had given his ambassador instructions to bring his bride to
      England with as little parade and as few foreign attendants as possible;
      but she screamed and cried in such a way when preparations for her journey
      were being made that her mother was obliged to promise to accompany her to
      England, and her brother to go part of the way. Three Italian ladies of
      the highest rank were permitted among her bed-chamber appointments. They
      were Madame Molza, Madame Montecuculi, and her daughter, Anna, a young
      girl of seventeen. A lady named Turenie, who had been governess to the
      princess from her infancy, was added to the list also. These four ladies
      proved devoted friends, and followed Mary Beatrice throughout her life.
    
    
      It had been a trial for the young Duchess of York to bid farewell to her
      native place; but when, two days later, she had to part with the brother
      who shared her joys and sympathized with her sorrows almost from her
      cradle, her burden of grief seemed greater than she could bear. Forgetting
      the dignity that her station demanded, or the presence of the formidable
      array of English and Italian nobles, she remembered only that she was
      losing, perhaps forever, [250] a
      name="link250" id="link250">the little brother whom she loved better
      than any one in the world. She pressed him to her heart again and again,
      and burst into an agony of tears when the youthful prince was led away. It
      was a consolation, at least, that her mother was to continue with her, and
      her mind was soon diverted by the welcome she received at the hands of the
      several princes of Italy, through whose dominions she passed with her
      attendants.
    
    
      On arriving at the French border the bridal train was met by officers of
      Louis XIV., who defrayed all the expenses, and conducted them to Paris.
      They were lodged at the Arsenal, and magnificently entertained.
    
    
      All that remains of this building shows what a splendid one it must have
      been, but the storms of revolution have passed over it and left it almost
      in ruins.
    
    
      The Earl of Peterborough was anxious to get to England with his charge as
      quickly as possible, but Mary Beatrice became so ill that she was unfit to
      travel for several weeks. Her disease was a low fever, occasioned by the
      mental anxiety she had endured for so many weeks. After her recovery the
      young duchess visited Versailles, where she was received with the highest
      consideration, and entertained with all the splendor of that court. It was
      a dreadful ordeal for so young and inexperienced a girl to know just what
      degree of attention to accord each person without too much condescension
      on her own part, but particularly so for one who had no taste for the
      formalities of royalty, and greatly preferred the seclusion of a cloister.
      But Mary Beatrice excited admiration for her beauty and charming manners,
      of which the king showed his appreciation by making her some costly
      presents. She had already received jewels valued at twenty thousand pounds
      from her unknown husband, which she wore on state occasions while in
      France.

      Original
    
    
      [253]Meanwhile
      a strong party in England had leagued itself, under the leadership of the
      Earl of Shaftesbury, for the purpose of destroying the Duke of York, and
      of getting the reins of the government in their own hands. This was no
      easy matter, because his services in his country's cause, his energy, and
      his high sense of honor, had rendered him one of the most popular of
      princes; but the party opposed to him were ready to resort to any
      measures, no matter how vile, to gain their end.
    
    
      Knowing this, the duke had managed his marriage with the utmost secrecy
      and despatch, because the strongest avowed point of opposition was his
      adherence to Catholicism, which his alliance with a Catholic princess
      would naturally strengthen. So when parliament met, on the twentieth of
      October, they were perfectly astonished and highly indignant to hear from
      the king's lips that the duke was already married to the Princess of
      Modena, who was even then on her way to England. The infuriated Commons
      petitioned their sovereign "to appoint a day of general fasting, that God
      might avert the dangers with which the nation was threatened."
    
    
      Charles told them that they might fast as much as they pleased, though he
      knew that by so doing they merely desired to show their contempt for what
      they called the "popish marriage," though the pope had positively withheld
      his consent to it. The members of the king's own cabinet became alarmed at
      the threatened storm, and urged his majesty either to forbid the princess
      to leave Paris or to dismiss his brother from court, and insist upon his
      leading the life of a country gentleman. Charles indignantly refused both
      propositions.
    
    
      The day after parliament met Mary Beatrice landed at Dover, where her
      husband awaited her on the beach, and all the citizens had collected to
      get a sight of her. [254] a name="link254"
      id="link254">The duke received her in his arms, and was charmed with
      her at the outset, as well he might have been; but she, poor child, was
      not so favorably impressed with a man old enough to be her father, and
      showed her aversion plainly. This did not discourage the groom, who
      treated her with courtly attention, feeling convinced that he should win
      her heart in time.
    
    
      In the presence of his suite and the bride's, besides a large number of
      Dover people, the Duke of York was married to Mary Beatrice according to
      the church of England rites, and the little ruby ring placed on her finger
      that day was more highly valued to the end of her life than any jewel the
      princess possessed.
    
    
      The second day after the marriage the bride and groom, attended by the
      Duchess of Modena, and her brother-inlaw, the Prince Rinaldo d'Esté,
      besides the members of their court, set out for London. King Charles went
      down the river with his court, in the royal barges, to meet the bridal
      suite, and received his new sister-in-law with every mark of affection;
      then he conducted the party to Whitehall, where his queen vied with him in
      her acts of loving attention to the bride.
    
    
      Even her enemies were for the time being disarmed when they gazed on the
      lovely, innocent countenance of the young bride; and at King Charles's
      court she was much admired and esteemed.
    
    
      The Duke and Duchess of York established themselves at St. James's Palace,
      where all the foreign ambassadors called to congratulate them, and where
      they held their courtly receptions as regularly as the king and queen did
      theirs at Whitehall, though on different days. King Charles was devoted to
      his brother, and soon became warmly attached to his wife, but a little
      coolness was early established between Queen Catharine and the Duchess of
      York in
    
    
      [255]this
      way: It had been stipulated in the marriage treaty that the duchess was to
      have the use of the Catholic chapel at St. James's which had been fitted
      up by the queen-mother, Henrietta, for herself and her household. But King
      Charles, knowing how unpopular any display of her religion at that time
      would make his brother's wife, influenced Catharine to claim it as one of
      her chapels, and had a private apartment in the palace fitted up for the
      devotions of the young duchess and her suite. This was a piece of
      friendship on the part of the king that was not appreciated by his
      sister-in-law, who laid the blame on the queen, with whom she felt quite
      offended.
    
    
      At the end of the year the Duchess of Modena was called home by some
      intrigues that had been begun during her absence; but although Mary
      Beatrice was sorry to part with her, she had by that time begun to love
      her husband so much that the parting was not so great a trial as it would
      otherwise have been, and the love that was implanted in her heart
      developed into a devotion that lasted to the day of her death.
    
    
      The first years of her married life were passed by the young duchess in a
      succession of gayeties. She was often annoyed because her husband treated
      her like a child, but as she was little older than his daughter this is
      not surprising. In later years circumstances developed the force of her
      character, and won the respect and admiration that she truly merited.
    
    
      She had the good sense to study English, and soon became a perfect
      mistress of the language.
    
    
      A..D. 1675. Mary Beatrice had a little daughter
      born about a year after her marriage. This was a great pleasure, but it
      was soon marred by the duke's refusal to have the baby baptized a
      Catholic. He did not object himself, but explained to his wife that their
      children belonged to the [256] a
      name="link256" id="link256">nation and would be taken from them if not
      brought up according to the established church, adding that is was besides
      the king's pleasure, to which they must submit. The youthful mother
      appeared to yield, but sent for her confessor, Father Gallis, and had the
      child baptized on her own bed according to the rites of the church of
      Rome.
    
    
      When the king came a day or two later to make arrangements with her and
      the duke for the christening of their child, Mary Beatrice told him that
      "her daughter was already baptized." Without paying the slightest
      attention to this assertion, his majesty ordered the little princess to be
      borne to the royal chapel, where she was christened by a Protestant
      bishop, her half-sisters, Mary and Anne, acting as sponsors. The baby was
      named Catharine Laura after the queen and the Duchess of Modena, and the
      Catholic baptism was kept a profound secret, though it must have been a
      subject of annoyance to the king.
    
    
      A fortnight later some very severe laws were made against the Catholics.
      One of them forbade any British subject from officiating as a Romish
      priest, either in the queen's chapel or elsewhere; another prohibited any
      adherent of the Catholic, church to set foot in Whitehall or St. James's
      Palace, the penalty for such an offence being imprisonment. This law of
      course kept the Duchess of York and the Catholic ladies of her household
      from the king's palace, but the young mother was so wrapt up in her baby
      that she was indifferent to almost anything besides. She was happy with
      her husband also, and lived on terms of close friendship with her
      step-daughters, who never accused her of the slightest unkindness to them,
      even in later years, when they would have been pleased to bring any
      unfavorable accusation against her. But the young mother was soon to be
      deprived of the infant she loved so fondly, for it died of a convulsion
      before it was ten months old.
    
    
      [257]This
      was, of course, a great sorrow to Mary Beatrice, but she was not permitted
      to indulge it very long, for before the close of the year she had to
      attend a feast given by the lord mayor, and a ball at her own palace.
    
    
      A.D. 1676. Another princess was born the next
      year, and this time there was no secret baptism. That ceremony was
      performed by Dr. North, Master of Trinity College, and the child was named
      Isabella. She lived to the age of five years.
    
    
      A.D. 1677  The following year the marriage
      between the Princess Mary and the Prince of Orange was solemnized; and it
      was this union that proved so disastrous to the fortunes of the Duchess of
      York, her husband, her children.
    
    
      There was much rejoicing in the household of the Duke when a little prince
      made his appearance. He was christened with great pomp by the Bishop of
      Durham, and no less a person than the king himself, assisted by the Prince
      of Orange, acted as sponsor. Charles bestowed his own name on his nephew,
      and created him Duke of Cambridge. The little fellow died the following
      month, and was interred, as his sister had been, in the vault of Mary
      Queen of Scots, at Westminster Abbey.
    
    
      The duke grieved more for the death of this boy than he had for any of his
      children. The Prince of Orange wrote a letter of condolence; but, as he
      was then plotting against his royal father-in-law, and as the death of the
      little prince opened the way to the throne for his wife, it is not
      probable that he was sincere in his expressions of sympathy. But Mary
      Beatrice was ignorant of this, and when she heard that the Princess of
      Orange was ill she planned a visit to her, which, after obtaining the
      king's consent, she undertook, in company with Princess Anne and her lord
      chamberlain, the Earl of Ossory. As it was her desire [258] a
      name="link258" id="link258">to ascertain the true state of Princess
      Mary's health, and to afford her comfort, the duchess travelled incognito,
      and sent a man on before to hire for her a small house not far from the
      palace. This was done to secure free intercourse among the three ladies
      without any of the formality required by court etiquette.
    
    
      A.D. 1678. Although the visit was a flying one,
      the duchess found a storm gathering around her husband on her return which
      soon compelled him to give up his seat among the state councillors. His
      friends advised him to retire to the continent with his family; but his
      proud spirit revolted from any move that would have the appearance of
      guilt or cowardice. The king urged him to baffle his enemies by returning
      to the church of England, but he refused to act in opposition to his
      conscience. Then for the sake of peace, which the "merry monarch" would
      have purchased at any cost, Charles advised his brother to go abroad
      before the next session of parliament. James consented, providing the king
      would command it in writing, but he scorned the idea of running away. The
      order was given in the form of an affectionate letter, and on the fourth
      of March the Duke and Duchess of York embarked for Holland. They were not
      permitted to take their little daughter Isabella to share their exile,
      which was a great deprivation to both parents.
    
    
      A.D. 1679. The king called on the day of their
      departure to bid farewell, and was much affected at parting with the
      brother whom he loved so well. The weather was very stormy, and wiping the
      tears from his eyes Charles said: "The wind is contrary; you cannot go on
      board at present."
    
    
      Mary Beatrice, who considered that her husband was being sacrificed to
      secure his brother's peace of mind, replied with spirit, "What, sir, are
      you grieved?       you who
    
    
      [259]
    
    
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Original
    
    
      [261]send
      us into exile! Of course we must go, since you have ordained it." She
      regretted this speech later, because she knew that Charles had only
      yielded to the clamor of her enemies.
    
    
      The duke and his wife arrived at the Hague a week later, and were received
      by the Prince of Orange with every demonstration of respect. Later they
      removed to Brussels, where they occupied the house Charles II. had lived
      in before the restoration.
    
    
      In July the Duchess of Modena joined her daughter, from whom she had been
      separated for five years, and the two ladies were rejoiced to meet again.
      But the Duke and Duchess of York could not rest contented so long as their
      children were away from them, so they wrote to the king entreating him to
      send them to. Brussels. He consented, and Princess Anne, with the infant
      Princess Isabella, left England on the nineteenth of August. They had not
      been with their parents many days when a messenger, sent by the Earl of
      Sunderland, arrived in Brussels to inform the duke of the king's serious
      illness. James set out at once to visit his brother without mentioning his
      intention to any one but Mary Beatrice, and travelled so privately and so
      quickly that his presence in England was not suspected until he presented
      himself at Windsor at seven o'clock in the morning. Charles was so much
      better that he was up and partly dressed. Fearing that it might injure his
      brother if it were known that he had sent for him, the Duke of York knelt
      and begged his majesty's pardon for coming before he was recalled. Then
      all the courtiers flocked around the traveller and paid their compliments,
      for James was really a favorite, and his presence always commanded
      respect. The king was so delighted to see him that he declared "nothing
      should part them again." However, by the end of a fortnight Charles was
      convinced that his [262] a name="link262"
      id="link262">brother could no longer remain with him in safety, but he
      gave permission for him to remove his family from Brussels to Scotland.
      Then the duke went back to the continent, and was making a farewell visit
      to the Prince and Princess of Orange, in company with his wife, his
      children, and the Duchess of Modena, when a message arrived from King
      Charles recalling them all, but directing the duke to embark for the Downs
      and remain there till further orders. Everybody was delighted but the
      Prince of Orange, who had his own reasons for objecting to the duke's
      return; however, he had no voice in the matter at that time. Two days
      later Mary Beatrice bade farewell to her mother, who had passed two months
      with her, and embarked with her family for England. The voyage was very
      stormy, and the duchess suffered excessively from seasickness. Party
      excitement ran so high, and the king's power was so diminished, that by
      the time the duke arrived at the Downs a messenger informed him that the
      king had changed his mind about his coming to London, and that two
      frigates were in readiness to convey him and his family to Leith, in
      Scotland, where the Duke of Lauderdale had been ordered to make
      arrangements for their reception.
    
    
      The duchess was too ill to proceed further by sea, and her husband did not
      dare to take her ashore without a written permission from the king, so
      there she lay tossing about in the Downs while an express was sent to
      London. Charles was sorry to hear of her miserable condition, and ordered
      his brother to bring her to St. James's Palace forthwith. They were
      delighted to find themselves safe on terra firma after all they had
      suffered; but they were not yet at their journey's end, for the very night
      of their arrival the king assured his brother that he had no power to
      protect him if he persisted in remaining in England.
    
    
      A week later two of his friends informed the duke that  span
      class="pagenum">[263]his majesty
      desired him to withdraw to Scotland for a short period, but that his wife
      and children might remain under his care at St. James's Palace. But Mary
      Beatrice was too devoted a wife to permit her husband to go into exile
      alone; so, although it necessitated separation from her little daughter
      and a weary journey over roads that were almost impassable, she went with
      him.
    
    
      Every action of the duke's had been so perverted that his great naval
      victories were attributed to cowardice, and every other, no matter how
      great a benefit it had proved to the nation, to a desire for the
      advancement of popery. This being the case, no marks of favor were shown
      him as he advanced towards the North, and the discourtesy of the towns
      that thirteen years before had lavished attentions on him pained him
      excessively.
    
    
      No sooner did the royal couple reach the Scottish border than everything
      was changed, and they were met with every mark of affection and respect.
      Three miles from Berwick the Scotch guards, under the Marquis of Montrose,
      were drawn up to welcome them, and a little further on two thousand
      gentlemen on horseback awaited them. The duke alighted from his carriage
      to receive the compliments of the lord chancellor, who headed the
      procession; then several of the nobles kissed his hand, and paid the same
      respect to the duchess, who sat in her coach. With this numerous escort
      their royal, highnesses were attended to the house of Lauderdale at
      Lethington, where, with their whole retinue, they were splendidly
      entertained until they made their public entry into Edinburgh.
    
    
      The people of Scotland were so pleased to have the royal family
      represented in their country that they were unwilling to believe any of
      the calumnies against the duke, and looked forward to great prosperity
      from the establishment of a court among them. But James desired to live
      [264]as
      privately as possible to avoid creating jealousy among his enemies in
      England.
    
    
      The Countesses of Peterborough and Roscommon, as several other ladies of
      high rank who had been with Mary Beatrice since her marriage, attended her
      to Scotland. They found Holyrood Abbey, where they made their home, far
      less luxurious than any former palace they had inhabited; but the duchess
      made no complaint, and always tried to be cheerful for her husband's sake.
    
    
      A.D. 1680. King Charles had promised his brother
      that he should not remain long in exile, and he was as good as his word.
      At the beginning of the new year his majesty entered the council chamber
      and made the astounding announcement that, as he had derived no benefit
      from the absence of his brother, whose lights he knew would be disputed at
      the next meeting of parliament, he had ordered him back to London to give
      him an opportunity of defending himself.
    
    
      A great many people were much pleased at this action on the part of the
      king, and even offered thanks for it; but the powerful party who were
      opposed to everything he did, and objected to the Duke of York as
      successor to the crown, were very angry. Their leader, Shaftesbury, and
      several other members of the house of lords, resigned on the spot. Charles
      declared that "he accepted their resignation with all his heart."
    
    
      The Duke and Duchess of York were rejoiced at their recall to England, but
      they had gained so many friends in Scotland that their departure from
      there caused a great deal of regret. The lords of the council wrote a
      letter of thanks to King Charles for the honor he had done them in sending
      the duke to their country, and praised his wise and prudent conduct with
      much warmth.
    
    
      The royal couple returned by water, and were saluted by  span
      class="pagenum">[265]the guns
      from the ships and tower as they ascended the river to Whitehall, where
      the king stood at the gate to receive them. They were immediately
      conducted to the queen's apartment, and then to their own, where they once
      more embraced the little daughter whom they had not seen for four months.
      That night the city was illuminated, and two days later the city officers
      called in a body to congratulate the duke and his wife on their return. A
      grand supper was given by the lord mayor in honor of the royal brothers,
      and the aldermen drank the king's health on their knees, and grew so loyal
      as the wine was swallowed that they "wished every one hanged and consigned
      to perdition who would not serve his majesty with his life and fortune."
    
    
      The duke and duchess established their court at St. James's Palace, and
      gave a series of brilliant balls and feasts that increased their
      popularity considerably. Mary Beatrice was so highly respected that even
      her bitterest enemies could find no excuse for mixing her name with the
      popish plot, of which we gave an account in the last reign.
    
    
      But Shaftesbury and his colleagues were not to be baffled; they had
      determined on the ruin of the Duke of York, and never rested until they
      had forced the king to agree to his banishment once more. They wanted the
      sea to separate him from England, but Charles compromised in his usual
      way, and notified his royal highness that he was to return to Scotland.
      The duke was sorely grieved, for he believed that even his brother had
      turned against him; and that his banishment to Scotland would be followed
      up by something worse. He was the more convinced of this when, in order to
      protect himself against the machinations of his powerful enemies, he
      demanded of the king a general pardon, under the great seal, for any
      offence that might be charged against him, and his majesty refused. He
      gave [266]as
      his reason that it would be injurious to a man of the duke's exalted rank
      to have such a document drawn up; but James became so enraged that he
      swore "that if he were pushed to extremity, and saw himself likely to be
      entirely ruined by his enemies, he would throw himself into the arms of
      Louis XIV. for protection." Of course such a threat was treasonable, and
      only to be excused on account of excessive indignation, for the duke was
      burning under the sense of wrong and ingratitude from a king and a country
      in whose service he had risked his life so often. Poor Mary Beatrice was
      called upon to part with her little Isabel again, and this separation was
      the last, for the mother never more beheld her only child.
    
    
      The following beautiful lines by the poet Dryden were written to
      commemorate the embarkation of the Duke and Duchess of York, which
      occurred on the eighteenth of October:       
    
    
      
    
    
      "Go, injured hero! while propitious gales,
    
    
      Soft as thy consort's breath, inspire thy sails;
    
    
      Well may she trust her beauties on a flood
    
    
      Where thy triumphant fleets so oft have rode.
    
    
      Safe on thy breast reclined, her rest be deep,
    
    
      Rocked like a Nereid by the waves asleep;
    
    
      While happiest dreams her fancy entertain,
    
    
      And to Elysian fields convert the main.
    
    
      Go, injured hero! while the shores of Tyre
    
    
      At thy approach, so silent shall admire;
    
    
      Who on thy thunder shall their thoughts employ,
    
    
      And greet thy landing with a troubling joy."
    
    
      
    
    
      After a stormy voyage of a week, the Duke and Duchess of York arrived on
      the shores of Scotland, and when they observed the joy manifested by every
      class of inhabitants at their return, their sad hearts warmed towards the
      nation that were so eager to prove their gratitude and loyalty.
    
    
      They travelled through Scotland attended by an ever-increasing train of
      devoted followers, and received at every

      Original
    
    
      [269]stopping
      place the most unbounded hospitality. At Leith they were met by a grand
      procession, headed by the Earl of Linlithgow, colonel of his majesty's
      guards, and a regiment of soldiers, besides nobility and gentry on
      horseback, and a long train of coaches filled with councillors and noble
      ladies and gentlemen. As they advanced guns fired, bells rang, bonfires
      were lighted, and crowds assembled with shouts of welcome. The city
      authorities of Edinburgh met their royal highnesses at the gate of
      Holy-rood Palace, and the lord provost on his knees presented the silver
      keys of the city to the duke, at the same time offering a welcome in the
      name of all the citizens.
    
    
      Holyrood Palace had been repaired and the royal apartments refitted for
      the accommodation of the duke and duchess, with their retinue; so their
      home was by no means as comfortless as it had been on their former sojourn
      there.
    
    
      The portrait of Mary Beatrice had been painted by Lely just before her
      departure from London; and it was the last work of that great artist, who
      died before the end of the year.
    
    
      The duchess was not quite twenty, and at the height of her beauty. She is
      represented with her hair falling around her head in luxuriant curls; her
      dress is scarlet velvet, embroidered and fringed with gold, cut low at the
      neck and filled in with soft cambric, of which material the flowing
      sleeves are also made. A full rich scarf, of royal blue fringed with gold
      and pearls, crosses one shoulder, and falls in graceful folds over the lap
      to the ground. The lady is sitting in a garden, and a tree in the
      background is entwined with honey-suckles and roses; her left hand rests
      on the neck of a beautiful white Italian greyhound.
    
    
      A brilliant court was established at Holyrood, and Mary Beatrice succeeded
      in winning all hearts by her kind and [270] a
      name="link270" id="link270">gracious manners. Her religion was
      unpopular, but she intruded it upon no one, and her conduct was admirable.
    
    
      Behind the Abbey of Holyrood there was along avenue shaded with stately
      oaks, where James was in the habit of taking his daily exercise. The green
      strip at the foot of the hill is called "the duke's walk" to this very
      day, though all the beautiful trees have been removed.
    
    
      Mary Beatrice introduced tea-drinking among the Scotch ladies, and the
      fashion soon became general, for she was so much admired that it became a
      pleasure to imitate her. She was loved because she tried to please, and
      the duke was not behind-hand in this respect. His royal highness
      established a bond of good fellowship between the nobles and the mechanics
      which added greatly to his popularity. It was done in this way: Tennis and
      golf, both games played with clubs and balls, were the favorite amusements
      among the gentry of Scotland in those days. The duke enjoyed them also,
      and always selected a mechanic or tradesman for his partner. Of course
      this example was imitated by the courtiers, and thus high and low were
      brought into pleasant contact. His royal highness generally played against
      the Duke of Lauderdale, who was an excellent golfer as well as himself.
      One day they agreed to stake an unusually large sum of money on the game.
      James called a shoemaker named John Paterson to assist him, and after a
      very hard contest defeated his opponent. When Lauderdale paid the three or
      four hundred gold pieces that he had forfeited, his royal highness handed
      them to Paterson, saying: "Through your skill I have won the game, and you
      are, therefore, entitled to the reward of the victory." The bonnie Scot
      was more pleased with the delicate compliment than with the gold. It was
      many such acts that endeared James to the people amongst whom his lot was
      cast. When Lochiel, a brave Highlander, was [271] a
      name="link271" id="link271">presented at court, the duke received him
      with marked courtesy, and questioned him about his adventures. During the
      conversation he asked to see the chieftain's sword, which was delivered
      into his hands without hesitation. The duke tried to draw it from the
      scabbard, but as it was merely a dress-sword, not meant for use, it had
      become rusty. After a second attempt he handed it back to the owner,
      saying: "That his sword was never so difficult to draw when the crown
      wanted its service." Lochiel was so embarrassed that he did not know what
      reply to make, but drew the sword and handed it to his royal highness, who
      turning to the courtiers present, said: "You see, my lords, Lochiel's
      sword gives obedience to no hand but his own!" and thereupon knighted the
      Highlander on the spot.
    
    
      The duke arrived in Scotland just after an insurrection, when many people
      lost their lives and property; but he exerted such an excellent influence
      that peace was soon restored, and prisoners liberated whenever they
      promised to cry "God save the King!" He governed Scotland well for his
      brother, and won the love of the populace by always resorting to the
      mildest of punishments in opposition to the barbarities practiced by
      Lauderdale.
    
    
      During the winter the duchess met with an accident that nearly cost her
      life. She was thrown from her horse, and her long riding-habit becoming
      entangled in the saddle, she was dragged some distance and received
      several kicks from the terrified animal before she could be rescued.
      Fortunately this occurred on a sandy plain, otherwise she must have been
      killed. As it was, she was taken up covered with blood and perfectly
      insensible. She recovered in time, having received no serious injury, but
      was obliged to give up her favorite amusement; for her husband, who always
      considered horseback riding dangerous for women, exacted a promise that
      she would never so imperil her life again.
    
    
      [A.D. 1681.] [272] a name="link272"
      id="link272">The spring brought bad news, for King Charles sent a
      messenger to inform his brother and sister that their little daughter,
      Isabel, had died at St. James's Palace. This cruel blow only made the
      banishment and persecution of the duke and duchess harder to bear, and
      James wrote to his brother for permission to take his wife to some
      watering-place in England, saying that she needed the change, and that the
      climate of Scotland did not agree with her.
    
    
      Charles could not grant the request, because he feared that the duke's
      return would be the signal for rebellion; but after three or four months'
      deliberation the favor of Princess Anne's company was granted to her
      parents, and she went to Scotland to join them.
    
    
      Shortly after her arrival the Duke of York rode in state from Holyrood,
      and opened parliament as lord high commissioner from his brother, the
      king. The duchess, Princess Anne, and all their ladies were present on
      that occasion, and this was such an unusual sight that some of the old
      fogies considered it highly indecorous. The Scottish lords and chieftains
      had always settled their debates with dagger and sword, and it was in
      order to avoid such stormy scenes that the Duke of York introduced the
      refining influence of women's presence, and the effect was highly
      satisfactory. After the meeting James gave a banquet to the whole
      parliament, separate tables being laid for the lords and commons.
    
    
      The city of Edinburgh returned the compliment with an entertainment to the
      Court of Scotland that cost more than fourteen hundred pounds sterling.
    
    
      After their royal highnesses recovered from the shock occasioned by the
      death of their little daughter, life at Holyrood became one long scene of
      gayety and brilliancy. There were balls, plays, and masquerades night
      after night,

      Original
    
    
      [275]and
      musical dramas, similar to the opera of the present day, in which the
      Princess Anne and other ladies of quality took part. So long as the plays
      were moral, Mary Beatrice honored them with her presence; for she believed
      that the stage ought to be a medium for giving wholesome instruction to
      the public, but she would countenance nothing coarse or vulgar.
    
    
      A.D. 1682. Affairs took such a favorable turn
      for James enuring the following year that he was recalled to England. He
      arrived with the Duchess and Princess Anne at Whitehall on the
      twenty-sixth of May, having been escorted up the river by a procession of
      barges, among which was the one containing the king and queen, who had
      gone to welcome them. In the evening the city of London was illuminated,
      and the rejoicing on account of the banished duke's return was universal.
    
    
      A.D. 1684. St. James's Palace again became the
      home of the royal pair, where they had a little daughter born in August,
      but it died within a few weeks. Two years later, so firm had the duke's
      position become, that he was once more offered the post of lord admiral,
      which he eagerly accepted. During the period of peace and national
      prosperity that preceded the death of Charles II., Princess Anne married
      Prince George of Denmark, but remained with her parents for awhile.
    
    
      A.D. 1685. A plan to banish the Duke of York
      once more had just been set on foot when King Charles died, and made way
      for him to mount the throne as James II. Mary Beatrice felt so grieved at
      the death of her brother-in-law that she could not rejoice at her own
      advancement; for Charles had been uniformly kind and amiable towards her,
      and she knew that she had lost a friend when he died.
    
    
      Compliments and congratulations were showered upon [276] a
      name="link276" id="link276">the new king from all sides, and on the
      first Sunday after his accession he was prayed for from every pulpit in
      the metropolis. King James began his reign with some very necessary
      reforms; he forbade drinking and swearing among others, and expressed his
      entire disapprobation of duelling, which he declared was no mark of
      courage.
    
    
      The queen's health was not good at this time, and she became so pale that
      in spite of her religious scruples her husband advised her to rouge, as
      other court ladies did, and she complied. The first time Father Seraphin,
      a monk, saw her so disfigured he expressed his surprise, and she explained
      that she had resorted to paint to conceal her palor, whereupon the monk
      replied, bluntly: "Madame, I would rather see your majesty yellow or even
      green than rouged."
    
    
      The twenty-third of April, St. George's day, was appointed for the
      coronation of the king and queen. The crown jewels had all been stolen by
      the Roundheads during the civil wars, so everything had to be supplied for
      the new queen, and the crown that was made specially for her was valued at
      one hundred and eleven thousand nine hundred pounds.
    
    
      On the Thursday previous to the coronation, the king washed the feet of
      fifty-two poor men, that number corresponding with his age. On the
      appointed day the queen, who had slept at St. James's Palace, performed
      her devotions as usual, and was then attired by her women in a royal robe
      of purple velvet, bordered with ermine, and looped with cords and tassels
      of pearls. Her tight-fitting frock underneath was of rich white and silver
      brocade, ornamented with pearls and precious stones. On her head was a cap
      of purple velvet, turned up with ermine and edged with a band of gold, set
      with large diamonds. As soon as her toilet was completed, the queen was
      carried in her chair [277] a name="link277"
      id="link277">to Westminster, where she rested in a private room until
      the king and all those who were to take part in the ceremony had
      assembled.
    
    
      When everything was ready, her majesty entered Westminster Hall, attended
      by her lord chamberlain, her other officers and ladies; the king entered
      at the same time by another door with his attendants, and the royal pair
      took their seats under separate canopies at the upper end of the hall.
    
    
      After the king's regalia had been delivered to him with the usual
      formalities, each article was placed on a table covered with rich
      tapestry. Then the queen received the crown, sceptre, and ivory rod with
      the dove, which were likewise deposited on the table, and subsequently
      distributed by the lord great chamberlain to the noblemen appointed to
      carry them. These noblemen walked first in the procession, then followed
      the queen, between the Bishops of London and Winchester, under a rich
      canopy, supported by sixteen barons. Four noble ladies carried her
      majesty's train, and eight bed-chamber women followed. The king's
      procession came next, and all proceeded in solemn state through a passage
      made by a double line of horse and foot guards to the abbey. The path was
      thickly strewn with fresh flowers by six young ladies, dressed in pointed
      bodices, with full brocaded skirts, looped back over rich petticoats. They
      wore hoods, gloves, and deep ruffles falling from the elbow. Trumpets were
      blown, drums beat a march, and the choir sang the well-known anthem, "O
      Lord, grant the king a long life!" etc., all the way to the church.
    
    
      It required several hours for all the ceremonies of the coronation to be
      performed, and the devotion of the queen in following the prayers and
      making the responses was observed by all present. King James had bestowed
      a great [278]deal
      of pains on his wife's regalia, but none on his own, so the crown that had
      been made for Charles II. was used for him, though it did not fit at all.
      The heads of the two brothers were as different as their characters, and
      it was regarded as an ominous sign that the crown could not be made to
      stay on James's head.
    
    
      The queen performed a noble deed of charity on that day that brought the
      blessings of thousands upon her head. She released all prisoners who were
      in jail for small debts, and herself paid every sum not exceeding five
      pounds. No wonder that the air rang with cries of "Long live Queen Mary!"
    
    
      When the ceremonies at the abbey were concluded, the procession returned
      to Westminster Hall, and their majesties rested in private rooms until all
      the company had taken their places at seven long tables which were laid
      for the banquet. Then the king, preceded by his great state officers,
      entered with the crown on his head, and the sceptre and orb in either
      hand, and seated himself in his chair of state at the head of the royal
      table. The queen did the same, her place being at the king's left hand.
      Most of the ancient ceremonies of coronation banquets were revived that
      day, and some of them are so curious that they will bear recounting.
      Certain lords went to the kitchen to receive the dishes and present them
      to their majesties, which was done in this way: The master of the horse
      called for a dish of meat, wiped the cover and the dish carefully, tasted
      the contents, and then ordered it to be conveyed to the royal table, he
      preceding the first course on horseback the full length of the hall,
      followed by a train of the principal officers of the household. Thirty-two
      dishes were brought up by the Knights of the Bath, and a number of others
      by private gentlemen. When the dinner was placed on the table, the lord
      chamberlain, carvers, cupbearers, and [279] a
      name="link279" id="link279">assistants went to the king's cupboard and
      washed; then the great basin was brought for the king to wash his hands.
      Before doing so he delivered his sceptre to a nobleman appointed to hold
      it, and the orb to the Bishop of Bath. The queen washed also, but she used
      only a wet napkin presented by the Earl of Devonshire on his knees. Grace
      was said, and their majesties sat down to the dinner, which consisted of a
      thousand dishes; among them were many Scotch dainties which reminded the
      king and queen of the hospitalities they had received in the North.
    
    
      Before the second course Sir Charles Dymoke rode into the hall on a
      splendid white horse, preceded by trumpeters, and attended by two
      gentlemen, one bearing his lance, the other his target. He was dressed in
      white armor, and wore a red, white, and blue plume in his helmet. He was
      brought up to the royal table, where the herald proclaimed his challenge,
      and the champion threw down the gauntlet. This was repeated three times,
      when the king drank from a gold cup which he presented to his champion,
      who then rode out of the hall. Several lords presented wine to the king on
      their knees, each one receiving the silver or gold cup his majesty drank
      out of for a present.
    
    
      When the dinner was ended grace was said, the washing of hands was
      repeated with the same ceremony as before, and their majesties withdrew.
      In the retiring-room they delivered their regalia to the Dean of
      Westminster, whose duty it was to keep such valuables under lock and key.
    
    
      One of King James's first acts after he ascended the throne was to release
      several thousand Roman Catholics and members of other churches who had
      been imprisoned for refusing to worship according to the prescribed laws
      of England. He also put a stop to the practice that had been permitted for
      many years of people informing against one another about their religious
      beliefs. As this was often [280] a
      name="link280" id="link280">resorted to merely to gratify some
      personal spite, and had been the means of bringing many an innocent person
      to the stake, King James did well to abolish it; but he was fighting the
      prejudices of the people, and could more easily have taken an impregnable
      fortress, as he soon found to his cost. Many of his subjects were offended
      at the display James made of his own religion, particularly when he opened
      a Catholic chapel at Whitehall, and insisted on going there in state with
      his wife, attended by the high officers of their household, to receive the
      sacrament. His lord treasurer, the Earl of Rochester, pretended to be ill
      as an excuse for absenting himself. The Dukes of Norfolk and Somerset
      openly refused to attend. It was the duty of Lord Godolphin, the queen's
      chamberlain, to lead her majesty by the hand to her place in the chapel,
      and to the altar when she chose to receive the sacrament. Although a
      Protestant, the chamberlain was so charmed with her majesty's beauty and
      graceful manners that he would not forego his privilege.
    
    
      King James summoned parliament in June because the Duke of Argyle raised a
      rebellion in Scotland, while Monmouth did the same in England, and funds
      were required to suppress both. Monmouth had always been one of James's
      bitterest and most dangerous enemies, because he thought he had a claim to
      the throne; he therefore issued a proclamation, denouncing the king "as a
      usurper, a murderer, a traitor, and a tyrant." He accused James of burning
      the city of London, of murdering Godfrey,       both events are treated of
      in the last reign,       of cutting the throat of Essex, and of poisoning
      his brother, Charles II. He raised an army of ten thousand men, and
      received so much encouragement at Taunton that he proclaimed himself king,
      and set a price on the head of "the usurper, James, Duke of York."

      Original
    
    
      [283]Such
      prompt and active measures were taken by the royal party that both Argyle
      and Monmouth were defeated and captured. The latter implored the king for
      mercy, and succeeded in obtaining a private interview. James had forgiven
      this bold man for many personal offences when he was Duke of York, but now
      his position was altered. He was King of England, and could not find it in
      his conscience to pardon an offender who had plunged his realm into civil
      war, and sacrificed the lives of three thousand of his subjects. Story,
      the orator, was taken prisoner for assisting Monmouth with his exciting
      speeches, that went far towards raising the popular indignation against
      the sovereign.
    
    
      When summoned to appear before the council he looked so haggard,
      neglected, and dirty that King James exclaimed, "Is that a man, or what is
      it?" On being informed that it was the rebel Story, his majesty replied:
      "Oh, Story; I remember him       a rare fellow, indeed." Then turning
      towards him, the king asked: "Pray, Story, you were in Monmouth's army in
      the west, were you not?"
    
    
      "Yes, an't please your majesty."
    
    
      "Pray, you were a commissary there, were you not?" asked the king.
    
    
      "Yes, an't please your majesty."
    
    
      "And you made a speech before great crowds of people, did you not?" was
      the next question,
    
    
      "Yes, an't please your majesty," answered Story.
    
    
      "Pray, if you have not forgot what you said, let us have a taste of your
      fine speech, some specimen of the flowers of your rhetoric."
    
    
      "I told them, an't please your majesty, that it was you who fired the city
      of London," boldly answered Story.
    
    
      "A rare rogue, upon my word," exclaimed James; "and, pray, what else did
      you tell them?"
    
    
      [284]"I
      told them, an't please your majesty, that you poisoned your brother."
    
    
      "Impudence in the utmost height of it!" said the king. "Pray, let us have
      something further, if your memory serves you."
    
    
      "I further told them," continued Story, "that your majesty appeared to be
      fully determined to make the nation both papists and slaves."
    
    
      The king had heard enough, and no doubt wondered at the audacity of a man
      who dared to accuse him to his face of crimes that his very soul would
      have revolted at. But with remarkable clemency his majesty added: "To all
      this I doubt not but a thousand other villanous things were added. But
      what would you say, Story, if after all this I were to grant your life?"
    
    
      He answered, "That he would pray for his majesty as long as he lived."
    
    
      Thereupon he was freely pardoned, but Monmouth and Argyle were executed.
    
    
      This victory of King James's would have increased his popularity and made
      him extremely powerful, had it not been for the cruel deeds that resulted
      from it. But Colonel Kirke and Chief-Justice Jeffreys were two barbarians,
      who caused the execution of thousands, whether innocent or guilty; going
      from one town to another whence Monmouth had gathered his forces, and
      committing most unheard-of cruelties.
    
    
      Such deeds, added to the mistake James made in attempting to have
      everything his own way, regardless of the will of parliament, led to his
      ruin and downfall. Popular indignation was aroused against all Roman
      Catholics, King James included, when Louis XIV. revoked the edict of
      Nantes. This was a law that had been made by Henry IV., granting the free
      exercise of religion to all Protestants, and [285] a
      name="link285" id="link285">when it was withdrawn, of course,
      persecutions followed. The result was that nearly fifty thousand
      Protestants sought refuge in England, and King James treated them with a
      great deal of consideration.
    
    
      A.D. 1687. The queen spent part of the spring of
      1687 at Richmond Palace, while James visited his camp at Hounslow; but her
      health was so poor that she was ordered by her physicians to take a course
      of treatment at Bath, and while there news of her mother's death reached
      her. This was a sad bereavement, and one from which Mary Beatrice did not
      soon recover. It opened a correspondence between her and the Prince of
      Orange, who, while expressing affectionate sympathy, was secretly plotting
      for the overthrow of his royal father-in-law. The king was very much under
      the influence of Sunderland, and of the Jesuit, Father Petre, both bad
      advisers; but he was also on terms of intimacy with William Penn, the
      founder of the State of Pennsylvania. This high-minded Quaker entered the
      king's presence one day, shortly after he ascended the throne, with his
      hat on his head. James immediately removed his, whereupon Penn said:
      "Friend James, why dost thou uncover thy head?" The king replied with a
      smile: "Because it is the fashion here for only one man to wear his hat.".
    
    
      Penn was sent to Holland to persuade William, Prince of Orange, to concur
      with the king in trying to do away with those laws that interfered with
      religious privileges in England, but met with no success, either with him
      or his wife, Mary.
    
    
      A.D. 1688. Queen Mary Beatrice had a little son
      born at St. James's Palace in 1688, and there was great rejoicing among
      the king's friends when the infant prince appeared, which was echoed in
      Edinburgh.
    
    
      The royal father felt so happy at the birth of his son that,  span
      class="pagenum">[286]in an evil
      hour, he granted forgiveness to Nathaniel Hook, who had been the Duke of
      Monmouth's chaplain. This man became one of the tools of William of
      Orange, and acted as a spy on the actions of the sovereign who had shown
      him such mercy.
    
    
      A grand display of fireworks took place in honor of the prince's birth
      when he was a few weeks old, and the royal couple were present at the
      palace window to witness it. Mary Beatrice was gratified by a letter of
      congratulation sent by the pope on the birth of her son, because his
      holiness had never been friendly since she married without his consent,
      nor was he now, as we shall see.
    
    
      The persons who were anything but pleased at the little fellow's
      appearance in the world were William of Orange and his wife, because both
      felt that he was in their way as heir to the crown.
    
    
      One of William's agents was discovered at Rome in secret correspondence
      with the pope's secretary, Count Cassoni. He was disguised as a peddler of
      artificial fruit, which, on being opened, were found to contain slips of
      paper, written in cypher, that disclosed a plan for the destruction of the
      king and the little prince. William of Orange was at the bottom of the
      conspiracy, and intended to carry out his purpose in this way: The pope
      was to supply funds to be used by the Prince of Orange for the invasion of
      England, which coming from such a source would not be suspected. All this
      was disclosed by the slips of paper contained in the fruit, and reached
      the ears of King James himself.
    
    
      The royal infant was so very ill when he was about two months old that it
      was thought each moment would be his last; however, he was provided with a
      good healthy nurse and got well, much to the delight of his parents, and
      the disgust of those whose interest it was to wish him out of the  span
      class="pagenum">[287]way. Then
      the king and queen with their household removed to Whitehall, and soon
      after her majesty's birthday was observed with the usual ceremonies and
      rejoicings.
    
    
      Mary Beatrice kept up a regular correspondence with the Prince of Orange,
      with whom she had always been on the most loving terms, and did not know
      what to make of the news that came to her about this time. It was that the
      Dutch fleet was hovering off the coast of England, ready at a moment's
      notice to make an attack. The queen could not believe such horrible
      tidings, and wrote her daughter: "That it was reported the Prince of
      Orange was coming over with an army, and that her highness would accompany
      him; but she never would believe her capable of turning against a good
      father, who, she believed, had always loved her the best of all his
      children." It was, nevertheless, true, and the storm that was to drive
      King James from the throne was gathering darkly and surely. James had
      committed some grave mistakes as a ruler, as a politician, as a
      theologian, and gladly would he have made amends, but it was too late. The
      King of France offered assistance, but with all his faults James loved his
      country too well to allow a foreign army to come to his rescue. He
      preferred other measures, whereby he hoped and fondly expected to avert
      the horrors of civil war. But his enemies were in his very household, and
      treachery surrounded him on all sides. The men who breakfasted with him in
      the morning, and pretended to be most loyal, deserted him before night.
      When he ought to have gone in person to repel the attacks of the Dutch
      fleet, he was persuaded by traitors to stay and defend the metropolis.
      When at last he did go he was so ill, so broken down, both in mind and
      body as to be utterly unfit for exertion of any kind. His confidential
      councillors went over to the enemy, and as the Prince of Orange advanced
      with his forces, James retreated towards London, [288] a
      name="link288" id="link288">paralyzed by the treachery that was daily
      brought to light. But the most heartrending blow of all awaited him on his
      return to the metropolis, for the first news he heard was that Princess
      Anne had deserted him. "God help me!" he exclaimed, bursting into tears,
      "My own children have forsaken me in my distress." When he entered the
      palace he added in the bitterness of his grief, "Oh, if mine enemies only
      had cursed me, I could have borne it!"
    
    
      Now, the unfortunate king's anxiety was for the faithful wife who had
      awaited his return in fear and trembling, and the innocent baby whose life
      the fond father feared was in danger. The valiant James Stuart of former
      years no longer existed; for he would not have submitted to the advance of
      a foe without offering desperate resistance, nor would he have abandoned
      his country at a moment when she needed his services.
    
    
      The heart-broken King James summoned his council, asked their advice, and
      appealed to their loyalty. They told him "he had no one to blame but
      himself," but offered no comfort or assistance. Indignation at the base
      treatment of those who ought to have stood by him in his adversity and
      grief, at the thought of the strait to which his own bad management had
      brought himself and his dear ones, had turned poor King James's mind; he
      could no longer protect his realm, for he was not in a condition to decide
      clearly on any subject. His entire attention was now turned towards the
      only two beings who were left him in the world,       his wife and baby;
      and those he was determined to save though he should forfeit his own life.
    
    
      It so happened that two Frenchmen, named Count de Lauzun and his friend
      St. Victor, had become so interested in King James and the state of
      affairs in England that they had offered their services to the distressed
      sovereign. To these two gentlemen James resolved to intrust the care of
      [289]his
      wife and child, and they eagerly consented to undertake the dangerous task
      of conveying them to France. They met the king and decided upon a plan so
      secretly that it was not suspected by any one. St. Victor went to
      Gravesend and hired two yachts,       one in the name of an Italian lady
      about to return to her own country, the other in that of Count Lauzun.
    
    
      December 9 was the day appointed for the queen to leave London. It was
      Sunday, but some of the advanced troops of the prince's army, who had
      dispersed in different parts of the city, began the day by burning
      Catholic houses and chapels, and creating a tumult that terrified the
      peaceful citizens, while tidings of other dreadful occurrences came from
      all parts of the kingdom. When night approached the queen implored her
      husband to allow her to remain and share his peril, but he assured her
      that he would follow her within twenty-four hours, and that it was
      necessary for the safety of their child that she should precede him. At
      ten o'clock their majesties went to bed, and when all was dark and quiet
      in the palace they got up and began preparations for departure. Shortly
      after midnight St. Victor ascended a secret staircase to the king's
      apartment. He was dressed like a common sailor, though he was well-armed
      underneath his coarse attire, and brought a disguise for the queen. Lady
      Strickland was in waiting that night, and assisted her majesty until two
      o'clock, when all who were to share the journey met in the apartment of
      Madame Labadie, where the prince had been carried secretly some time
      before.
    
    
      Turning to the count, King James said: "I confide my queen and son to your
      care; all must be hazarded to convey them with the utmost speed to
      France." Reserving a silence that was more eloquent than words, the queen
      gave her husband a parting look, then crossed the grand hall,  span
      class="pagenum">[290]and stole
      softly down the back-stairs with St. Victor, who had possessed himself of
      the keys. The two nurses followed close behind with the sleeping infant. A
      coach that St. Victor had borrowed from an Italian friend, without telling
      him to what use it was to be employed, stood at the gate. The queen, Count
      de Lauzun, and the two nurses with the baby entered, while St. Victor took
      his seat beside the coachman, and Mary Beatrice left Whitehall never to
      return. The coach had to pass six sentinels, who called out, "Who goes
      there?" Each time St. Victor replied boldly, "A friend," and, showing the
      keys, was permitted to pass without opposition. At Westminster the
      fugitives entered a boat in which St. Victor had crossed on several
      previous nights with his gun and a basket of cold provisions to make
      believe that he was a sportsman and thus avoid suspicion. But this
      particular night was so stormy, and the rain poured in such torrents, that
      the boatman must have known no unimportant errand would tempt a woman with
      an infant six months old to make so dangerous a trip, for the river had
      swollen, and the wind was blowing violently. When the travellers reached
      the opposite bank, which was at last accomplished after a great deal of
      difficulty, St. Victor looked anxiously around for the carriage that ought
      to have stood in waiting as he had arranged; but Monsieur Dusions, one of
      her majesty's pages, appeared promptly at a call, and said that it was
      still at the inn. St. Victor ran to fetch it, leaving De Lauzun to protect
      the queen, who stood for shelter under the walls of the old church at
      Lambeth, with her infant clasped close to her breast, dreading lest he
      should wake and betray her presence by his cries. But the little prince
      behaved well throughout the journey, happily unconscious of the danger to
      which he was exposed. Meanwhile St. Victor, at the inn-yard had excited
      some curiosity by his agitated manner, and his foreign  span
      class="pagenum">[291]accent,
      which prompted a man on watch to start out with his lantern to
      reconnoitre. Seeing that he directed his steps straight to where the queen
      was waiting, St. Victor hastened with all speed to the other side of the
      way, and then put himself in the man's path as though by accident,
      awkwardly pretended to be trying to clear the road, when the two came in
      contact and went rolling over in the mud together. The Frenchman was
      profuse in his apologies, which mollified the other man, who returned to
      the inn to relight his lantern and wash off the mud. This gave the queen
      and her party time to proceed, and before they had cleared three miles
      they were met by one of her majesty's equerries, who, by the king's
      thoughtfulness, had been sent with a fresh horse and a pair of boots for
      St. Victor, of which he was sorely in need by that time. When the queen
      reached Gravesend a little boat conveyed her to the yacht, that was filled
      with friends who had preceded her from London, and were determined to
      share her exile. Among them were Lord and Lady Powis, Anna Montecuculi,
      who had gone to England with Mary Beatrice when she married; Father
      Giverlai, the queen's confessor; William Walgrave, her physician; Marquis
      Montecuculi, Lord and Lady O'Brien Clare, Mesdames Labadie and Strickland,
      and two pages. These had gone down the Thames, consequently had made the
      passage in less time than the royal party had required.
    
    
      The captain of the yacht had not the-slightest suspicion of the rank of
      the Italian washerwoman, so anxiously awaited, who embarked with a bundle
      of clothes under her arm, in which her little prince was safely ensconced.
      The queen was always ill at sea, but heretofore she had been provided with
      all the comforts her husband could devise, as well as the pleasure of his
      presence. It was very different now, when not daring to encounter the
      Dutch men-of-war, she was forced to cross the channel in an ordinary  span
      class="pagenum">[292]packet,
      deprived of common necessaries; for none of the functionaries thought it
      necessary to pay attention to a poor washerwoman.
    
    
      As soon as she boarded the vessel the queen went below to avoid
      observation, while Madame Labadie, who knew Grey, the captain, engaged him
      in conversation until the sails were hoisted and the yacht well under way.
      King James had ordered De Lauzun, in case the captain discovered the
      fugitives or betrayed any intention to put his wife and son into the hands
      of the Dutch, to shoot him dead. The count stationed himself in a position
      to keep strict watch over every motion of the captain's, determined to act
      promptly in case of need; but that officer steered his course safely
      through a fleet of fifty Dutch ships, and landed his passengers at Calais,
      as ignorant of the queen's presence as when he left the English coast.
    
    
      Sixteen years before Mary of Modena had embarked on a royal yacht attended
      by her mother and a train of noblemen desirous of doing her honor; now she
      landed at the same port, a forlorn fugitive, disguised as a peasant, to
      seek refuge from the storm that had driven her from a throne. It would be
      hard to decide at which period' she was more an object of sympathy, if we
      recall the reluctance with which she left her convent home to unite her
      destinies with those of a man whom she had never seen, and behold her now,
      deprived of her regal state, it is true, but possessing a husband who has
      won her heart, and a dear little baby, who is her idol and his.
    
    
      The governor of Calais wished to show Mary Beatrice the honors due a queen
      of Great Britain, but she declined, and took up her residence at a private
      house to await the arrival of her husband, whom she expected to follow her
      in a few hours. But the governor sent everything to her house that the
      queen needed for comfort, and fired a royal salute at her departure.  span
      class="pagenum">[293]Soon after
      landing at Calais, Mary Beatrice wrote a pathetic letter to Louis XIV.,
      asking his protection for herself and son. He replied by sending his first
      equerry with the royal carriages to attend the queen and her suite to
      Paris, and ordered that every honor due her rank should be shown the royal
      lady en route.
    
    
      The king did not join his wife as he had promised, and she could receive
      no reliable intelligence as to his fate. Her heart was torn with
      conflicting rumors, and she spent her days in tears at a convent at
      Boulogne, to which place she had removed.
    
    
      A.D. 1689. It was not until the nineteenth of
      January that the queen knew the sad truth. Then she heard from the
      vice-admiral of England, who had arrived at Calais, that the king had set
      out on his journey, when he was arrested by order of the Prince of Orange
      and taken back under strict guard. Overcome with despair, the queen
      decided to send her son on to Paris, and return to London to share her
      husband's peril. But her faithful attendants dissuaded her from a course
      that could only have increased the king's trouble without rendering him
      the least service, and urged her to be guided by the directions he had
      given her at parting. That very day King Louis's equerry arrived with
      letters and messages from his majesty and a noble escort to convey the
      queen, with her attendants, to the Castle of St. Germain, which had been
      put in readiness for their reception. So anxious were the faithful
      followers of Mary Beatrice to remove her from the coast, where she might
      at any moment be tempted by some favorable opportunity to return to
      England, that they entreated her to accept the invitation of the King of
      France at once.
    
    
      She yielded, and left Boulogne the next day. On arriving at Montrieul a
      report reached the royal party that King James was still at Whitehall.
      [294]Now
      we must go back and see what really happened to James after his wife's
      departure. He wandered about in a state of nervous agitation until St.
      Victor returned from Gravesend with the announcement that the queen had
      embarked safely, and he had seen the yacht well on her course. Then his
      majesty brightened up, although there was not an hour but news reached him
      of the advance of his enemy's troops. Having summoned his council to meet
      at ten the next morning, the king went to bed as usual, without any
      intention of being present.
    
    
      At midnight he arose, disguised himself in a black wig, and shabby, plain
      clothes, and attended by Sir Edward Hales, descended by a private
      staircase to the garden and proceeded as the queen had done two nights
      before. He crossed the Thames in a little row-boat to Vauxhall, and when
      in the middle of the river threw in the great seal that he had taken from
      Whitehall. This is an unaccountable proceeding, because he evidently meant
      to make use of the seal after he got to France, and he must have changed
      his mind very suddenly. On arriving at Fever-sham after travelling all
      night, Sir Edward Hales sent his servant to the post-office, and as his
      residence was in that neighborhood, his livery was immediately known. A
      gang of ruffians who had formed themselves into an association to prevent
      the flight of Roman Catholics to France, dogged the man's footsteps to the
      river side, where they discovered that Sir Edward had taken refuge on a
      custom-house boat. At eleven o'clock that night fifty of the gang, armed
      with swords and pistols, boarded the boat, rushed into the cabin? seized
      the king and his companion. Perceiving that his majesty was not
      recognized, Sir Edward took Ames, the leader of the ruffians aside, put
      fifty guineas in his hand and promised a hundred more if he would allow
      them to escape. The man took the money and said he would go  span
      class="pagenum">[295]ashore to
      make arrangements for them, but advised them to hand over all their
      valuables to his keeping, because he could not answer for the conduct of
      his men while he was gone. The king gave him three hundred guineas and his
      watch, but contrived to conceal his coronation ring and three diamond pins
      that belonged to the queen. As soon as the tide rose in the morning the
      gang, who had mistaken James for Father Petre, rowed the boat to shore,
      and putting their two prisoners in a carriage, drove them to an inn amidst
      the shouts and yells of a mob that had assembled there. Suddenly a seaman
      in the crowd who had served under James recognized him, and bursting out
      into tears, knelt and begged to kiss his hand. The king was touched at
      this proof of devotion and wept, while the ruffians who had robbed and
      insulted him fell on their knees and sued for pardon. Then returning his
      majesty's sword and jewels, the seamen who were present declared "that not
      a hair of his head should be touched." Even then, had the king been in a
      proper state of mind, something might have been done for his cause,
      surrounded as he was at that instant by a band of loyal subjects; but he
      was mentally exhausted, and he began to talk in a wild, incoherent manner,
      until an alarming fit of nose-bleed left him in a helpless condition. For
      two whole days nobody in London knew of King James's whereabouts, until a
      Kentish peasant presented himself at the council chamber with a letter
      from his, majesty, stating his condition and demanding assistance. Some of
      the lords were for treating the letter with silent contempt, but they were
      overruled, and an escort was despatched to bring his majesty back to
      Whitehall. He was received with every demonstration of loyalty, and might
      have raised a powerful army to repel his foes, but his day had gone by; he
      could only weep and bemoan his sad fate, constantly repeating: "God help
      me, whom can I trust? My own children have forsaken me!"  span
      class="pagenum">[296]The king
      had been in London less than a week when he was rudely awakened at two
      o'clock one cold, stormy morning by three lords, who had openly avowed
      themselves his enemies. They came with an order from the Prince of Orange
      for him to leave Whitehall before ten o'clock and proceed to Rochester. He
      made the journey attended by a Dutch guard, who had orders from their
      prince to give their prisoner a chance to escape.
    
    
      Accordingly the back door of the house at Rochester was purposely left
      unguarded, and between twelve and one on the morning of December 23, the
      king attended by two faithful companions, made his way to the river and
      was rowed down to Sheerness, where, boarding a fishing-boat, he was landed
      on Christmas day at a village near Boulogne.
    
    
      The queen was at Beauvais when she heard of her husband's arrival on
      French soil, and forgetting all her misfortunes in this welcome news she
      raised her eyes to Heaven and exclaimed: "Then I am happy," and prayed
      aloud in the fulness of her heart.
    
    
      It was on the twenty-eighth of December that Mary Beatrice approached St.
      Germain. King Louis XIV. had advanced with his son and brother to a
      village at the foot of the hill on which stood the castle to await his
      royal guests. His cavalcade consisted of a hundred coaches, and all the
      noble ladies and gentlemen who attended him were dressed in magnificent
      attire. When the queen drew near with her party, Louis left his coach and
      went forward to greet her. His officers stopped the first carriage,
      supposing it to contain her majesty, but the occupants proved to be the
      little prince with his governess and his nurses. All alighted out of
      respect to the king, who took the baby in his arms, hugged and kissed him
      tenderly, and promised to cherish and protect the unconscious child.

      Original
    
    
      [299]Meanwhile
      Mary Beatrice had left her carriage and walked towards his majesty, who
      saluted her affectionately. After a great many complimentary speeches on
      both sides, the king presented the dauphin, as his son was styled, and
      monsieur his brother, then the four royal personages got into his
      majesty's coach and were driven to the Palace of St. Germain, which was to
      be the future home of Mary Beatrice. They alighted at the inner court,
      where, after placing everything at the queen's command, Louis led her to
      the apartments that had been newly-fitted up for the Prince of Wales. Such
      an affectionate welcome brought tears to the eyes of Mary Beatrice, who
      began to feel that she now needed nothing but the arrival of her beloved
      husband to fill her heart with peace.
    
    
      St. Germain Palace had been gorgeously fitted up for Queen Mary Beatrice,
      and contained every article of luxury that she could possibly desire. On
      her toilet table stood a casket of exquisite workmanship, of which
      Tourolle, the king's upholsterer presented her the key with rather a
      significent air. This she observed; but her mind was so occupied that she
      did not remember to open the casket until the next day, when she beheld
      six thousand bright, shining louis d'ors which the generous King Louis had
      placed there for her use.
    
    
      In the morning Louis and the dauphin sent to make inquiries about their
      guests, and at six in the evening they paid her majesty a visit, attended
      by Monsieur and the Duc de Chartres. She was in bed, feeling ill from the
      anxiety and fatigue she had undergone, but that did not prevent her
      receiving the royal guests. Queens were not allowed any privacy in those
      days, sick or well, and her majesty's chamber was soon crowded with the
      courtiers who had followed their sovereign, while he and the dauphin sat
      on the bed and chatted quite merrily. In about half an hour King  span
      class="pagenum">[300]James's
      arrival was announced, and Louis went out to meet him. James bowed low as
      his kinsman advanced, but Louis took him in his arms and embraced him
      warmly three our four times. Then the two kings conversed in a low tone
      for fifteen minutes, after which monsieur and the dauphin were presented
      to James, who was then conducted to his wife's room. As they entered,
      Louis said, playfully: "Madame, I bring a gentleman of your acquaintance,
      whom you will be very glad to see." The queen uttered a cry of joy, and
      the royal couple surprised the French courtiers by hugging and kissing
      each other right before them all. James was then led to the royal nursery,
      where it gladdened his heart to see the comforts that surrounded his
      darling boy. Louis was scrupulously mindful of every act of courtesy
      towards his unfortunate kinsman, and sent him a present of ten thousand
      pounds in such a delicate manner as not to wound his pride.
    
    
      St. Germain was familiar to King James, for it was there that he lived
      with his mother and the royal family of France during the troublous times
      that preceded his father's death. After a lapse of twenty-eight years he
      returned, again a fugitive, the last survivor of those who had shared his
      first adversity. Mother, brothers, sisters, all were dead, his two
      daughters had deserted him; the son of his best beloved sister, who had
      become his son-in-law, had driven him from his throne, and his wife and
      little son were deprived of their rights because of his fall. An appalling
      list of calamities; yet James bore them with a calmness that astonished
      his French friends. Both he and his wife felt their dependence, and
      desired to live as much in private as possible; but it was not permitted.
      The court of St. Germain was formed on the model of King Louis's, but the
      French officers were soon replaced by those members of the queen's
      household who followed her, though their [301] a
      name="link301" id="link301">property was confiscated and they
      forfeited the rights of citizenship by so doing. Mary Beatrice's old
      coachman, who had formerly served Oliver Cromwell, followed his royal
      mistress to St. Germain, and continued to drive her state coach until he
      died of old age.
    
    
      A.D. 1689. At first the etiquette of the French
      court was very irksome to Mary Beatrice, for it was much more formidable
      than in England, and she would have made many mistakes had she not had the
      good sense to refer all matters of precedency to Louis XIV. himself, and
      in every case to abide by his decision. The wife of the dauphin refused to
      call because the size and position of the chair she was to occupy in the
      presence of the Queen of England was not according to her fancy, so Mary
      Beatrice waived ceremony and made the first call, and in course of time it
      was arranged who was to sit, who was to stand, which noble lady or
      gentleman was to be placed to the right or the left of one of the royal
      personages, who was to go first, the size, shape, and height of the chair,
      besides many other matters that appear trivial to us; then all went
      smoothly. Mary Beatrice became the fashion; Louis XIV., the Grande
      Monarque, had held her up as a model for his daughter-inlaw, and said:
      "See what a queen should be," and that was enough to bring the whole court
      to her feet. Every one admired her ready wit, her grace, her beauty, but
      above all, her charming manners and her devotion to her husband. One day
      when King Louis was caressing her baby she said: "I had envied the
      happiness of my son in being unconscious of his misfortunes, but now I
      regret the unconsciousness which prevents him from being sensible of your
      majesty's goodness to him."
    
    
      The exiled king and queen were invited to St. Cyr to witness a new tragedy
      by Racine, and Mary Beatrice sat between her husband and Louis XIV. during
      the performance. [302] a name="link302"
      id="link302">Next day Louis entertained them at his palace at the
      Trianon, where the two kings had a long private conference, while the
      queen played cards with some ladies and gentlemen.
    
    
      Meanwhile affairs in England were going badly for the royal cause, and on
      the sixth of February a very small majority in parliament decided that the
      Prince and Princess of Orange should be proclaimed king and queen.
    
    
      James was still undisputed King of Ireland, and his subjects there urged
      him to visit their country; so, with a force consisting of a hundred noble
      French gentlemen, Lauzun being of the number, besides twenty-five hundred
      English and Scotch emigrants, he decided to go. King Louis supplied him
      with vessels and money, and offered troops, but James replied: "I will
      recover my own dominions with my own subjects or perish in the attempt."
      After his departure the queen left St. Germain and went with her little
      son to the convent of Poissy, intending to pass her time in prayers for
      the safety of her lord. From Poissy she went for awhile to the convent of
      Chaillot, several of the nuns of that community being among her best
      friends.
    
    
      A.D. 1690. King James was received with joy in
      Ireland, where his viceroy, Tyrconnel, met him with an army of forty
      thousand men, but they were composed of half-clad peasants, who were
      willing to fight, but had neither arms nor military discipline. With such
      forces little could be expected, and though the king met with a few
      trifling victories at first he really gained nothing. Mary Beatrice pawned
      or sold her jewels to keep him supplied with more money than she could
      manage to borrow from the French government, but all to no avail; one
      defeat came close upon the heels of another, until the battle of the Boyne
      convinced James that his cause was hopeless.
    
    
      Fortunately the queen had not heard of this dreadful

      until news reached her that her husband was safe in France, and all
      misfortunes sank into insignificance compared with the anxiety she had
      suffered on his account. In October the royal pair were invited to
      Fontainebleau, one of King Louis's most splendid palaces, to spend a few
      days, during which they were entertained with most generous magnificence.
      King Louis always sat at the queen's left hand, and showed her marked
      attention on every occasion. When it rained the guests remained indoors,
      and played a game of cards called loo in England, paume in France,
      that had been introduced by the Dutch. They were treated to a stag roast
      in the park by moonlight, and enjoyed seeing the animal that had been
      killed by the two kings in the morning roasted whole in the evening.
    
    
      A.D. 1691. During all this time Mary Beatrice
      was in correspondence with a great many people in England, who were most
      anxious for King James's restoration, and never consented to an allegiance
      to William and Mary. Dryden was one of these; he was Poet Laureate during
      James's reign, and one of the queen's numerous admirers.
    
    
      A.D. 1692. Assisted by King Louis XIV., James
      made another effort to regain his crown, but was defeated. The little
      prince was at that time a handsome bright boy, four years of age, and
      before the king departed on the expedition which terminated so
      disastrously he made his son a Knight of the Garter.
    
    
      King James became very despondent when his bad luck continued, and wrote
      Louis XIV.: "My evil star has had an influence on the arms of your
      majesty, always victorious but when fighting for me. I entreat you,
      therefore, to interest yourself no more for a prince so unfortunate, but
      permit me to withdraw with my family to some corner of the world where I
      may cease to be an interruption to your majesty's wonted course of
      prosperity and glory."
    
    
      [306]In
      the summer Queen Mary Beatrice had a daughter, and the king was so pleased
      when he beheld the child that he called it "his comforter," and said: "He
      had now one daughter who had never sinned against him." The princess was
      baptized with great pomp at St. Germain, and King Louis XIV., who acted as
      sponsor, gave her the name of Louisa Mary.
    
    
      Mary Beatrice was now the mother of two fine healthy children, and both
      she and the king were happier than they had been in many a day.
    
    
      Every year Mrs. Penn, the wife of the founder of Pennsylvania, paid a
      visit to the queen at St. Germain, and always brought a great many
      presents from friends in England to the royal exiles.
    
    
      A.D. 1695. At the beginning of the next year
      very important news was brought to St. Germain. It was of the death of
      Mary II., then Queen of England. It was naturally believed that after such
      an event the Princess Anne would assert her claim to the throne; but she
      was too shrewd to risk anything by an open rupture with King William,
      whose health was so bad that she decided to await the natural course of
      events. Meanwhile, she played a twofold game by her friendliness towards
      the king, while she kept up a secret correspondence with her father.
    
    
      A.D. 1696. The partisans of James urged him to
      make an attack on England after the death of Mary II., assuring him that a
      force of only ten thousand men would be sufficient to reinstate him on the
      throne; but he appeared strangely indifferent about that time, and could
      obtain no assistance from the French court. The next year, however, Louis
      XIV. did grant the required assistance; but so many circumstances
      prevailed against poor James that he was again unsuccessful, and returned
      to St. Germain. With a mistaken zeal for his cause, some of James's
      adherents had [307] a name="link307"
      id="link307">made an attack on the person of King William, which did
      no benefit to the exiled king, and caused the execution of many in
      England.
    
    
      King James was so poor that the allowance made him by King Louis was not
      large enough to enable him to pay the pensions of those who had lost all
      their worldly possessions because of their loyalty to him, so he was
      obliged from time to time to sell the queen's jewels. Mary Beatrice wrote
      on this subject to her friend, the Abbess of Chaillot: "In respect to our
      poor, I shall never consider that I have done my duty until I have given
      them all I have." By degrees she parted with all her valuables for the
      relief of her unfortunate British followers.
    
    
      A.D. 1697. In course of time circumstances
      compelled King Louis XIV. to acknowledge William as King of England; but
      in so doing he stipulated that Mary Beatrice should receive her dower
      regularly. Then the queen arranged that every payment should be made
      through the French king, to whom she owed so much; but she need not have
      troubled herself on that score, for although William charged the British
      nation with fifty thousand pounds annually for Mary Beatrice, he pocketed
      the entire amount and appropriated it to his own use. The excuse he gave
      was that King James and his wife were permitted to remain at St. Germain,
      though he had peremptorily demanded their removal from France.
    
    
      A.D. 1701. King James's health had been poor for
      several months, and the queen had felt much anxiety on his account, though
      he did not grow perceptibly worse. One Sunday he had an epileptic fit,
      which came on in church. He was carried out in a state of insensibility,
      and continued ill for several weeks, during which the queen remained
      constantly at his bedside, attending to his wants and watching every
      symptom as only a devoted wife can. [308] a
      name="link308" id="link308">Later, the king was removed to the baths
      of Bourbon, and Louis XIV. sent Fagon, his chief physician, to attend him,
      and paid all the expenses of the journey for the entire party. James
      improved so much that in less than three months he returned to St.
      Germain, in time for the celebration of the birthday fêtes of his
      children, both of which occurred in the month of June. The prince was
      fourteen at that time, and the princess was ten years of age.
    
    
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Original
    
    
      But King James was not long to enjoy the society of his family, for the
      return of his illness laid him on his deathbed before many months. The
      French council held a meeting to decide upon the English succession when
      James's death should occur, and the dauphin was one of the majority who
      decided in favor of the Prince of Wales. It was Louis himself who conveyed
      the satisfactory intelligence to [309] a
      name="link309" id="link309">the dying king. As he entered the bedroom
      one of the attendants aroused the invalid, who had been in a drowsy stupor
      all day, and announced the presence of the King of France. "Where is he?"
      asked James, with a painful effort.
    
    
      "Sir, I am here," replied Louis; "and am come to see how you do."
    
    
      "I am going to pay that debt which must be paid by all kings as well as
      their meanest subjects," returned James, slowly. "I give your majesty
      thanks for all your kindness to me and my afflicted family, and do not
      doubt its continuance, having always found you good and generous."
    
    
      Louis then informed the king that he had something of the greatest
      importance to communicate, whereupon the attendants began to withdraw; but
      Louis exclaimed, "Let no one retire!" Then turning to James again, he
      continued: "I am come, sir, to acquaint you that whenever it shall please
      God to call your majesty out of this world, I will take your family under
      my protection, and will recognize your son, the Prince of Wales, as heir
      of your three realms." At these words, all present, both English and
      French, threw themselves at the feet of the powerful sovereign, who
      mingled his tears with those that were shed around him.
    
    
      The dying king extended his arms to embrace his royal friend, and said:
      "Thank God, I die with perfect resignation, and forgive all the world."
    
    
      He then begged as a last favor that there might be no pomp at his funeral
      ceremonies. "That is the only favor I cannot grant," replied Louis. James
      begged that any money King Louis might feel disposed to spend for that
      purpose should be employed for the relief of his followers, whom he
      commended to that monarch's care.
    
    
      The queen was so grieved that she was often obliged to  span
      class="pagenum">[310]hide
      herself so that her husband might not witness her tears. His bed was
      situated in an alcove, and she would spend hours on the other side of the
      curtains, anxiously waiting for any sound from the dying king. While Louis
      XIV. was communicating his comforting news, Mary Beatrice sent for her son
      and bade him throw himself at the feet of the kind-hearted monarch, and
      express his gratitude. Louis raised the boy and embraced him tenderly;
      then leading him into an adjoining room, conversed with him a long while,
      gave him some excellent advice, and promised to act the part of a father
      towards him.
    
    
      King James had already taken leave of his children, but they were
      permitted to see him several times before he died; and he always smiled
      lovingly, even though he could not speak to them. The day before he
      expired King James bade farewell to the queen, and requested her to write
      to his daughter, the Princess Anne, and assure her of his forgiveness;
      also to charge her to atone to her brother for the injury she had done
      him. Then he gave some advice about the prince; and when Mary Beatrice was
      overcome with emotion, he asked tenderly: "Why is this? Are you not flesh
      of my flesh, and bone of my bone       are you not a part of myself? How
      is it, then, that one part of me should feel so differently from the
      other? I in joy and you in despair. My joy is in the hope I feel that God
      in his mercy will forgive me my sins and receive me into his beatitude,
      and you are afflicted at it. I have long sighed for this happy moment, and
      you know it well: cease, then, to lament for me. I will pray for you,       farewell!"
    
    
      This was the last interview the queen had with her husband, for he sank
      into a state of unconsciousness, and died the next afternoon at three
      o'clock. It was Father Ruga, the queen's confessor, who informed her when
      all was over. Although the blow was expected, it was hard to bear; for
      [311]Mary
      Beatrice had hoped to the last that her husband might still be spared to
      her. Her resignation to the will of God was perfect; but her sorrow was
      heartfelt and bitter.
    
    
      Crowds of French and English of all degrees passed in and out to take a
      last look at the dead king, who had requested that his chamber door might
      be left open for that purpose. Then all the courtiers went to the prince
      and saluted him as king, and at the same time he was proclaimed at the
      gates of St. Germain by the title of James III., King of England,
      Scotland, Ireland, and France.
    
    
      Court etiquette required that the queen also should offer the homage of a
      subject to her boy. She said to him: "Sir, I acknowledge you for my king;
      but I hope you will not forget that you are my son." She was so overcome
      by this ceremony that she retired at once, and was driven to the convent
      of Chaillot, where she desired to pass the first days of her widowhood in
      complete solitude, refusing to see any one whatsoever.
    
    
      The chapel had all been hung in black by the nuns as soon as the king's
      death was announced, and when the tolling of the bell warned them of Mary
      Beatrice's approach, they went in procession to receive her at the convent
      gate. She descended from her coach in silence, followed by four noble
      ladies who had accompanied her. The nuns gathered around her without
      speaking, the abbess kissed the hem of her robe, some of the sisters
      embraced her knees, and others respectfully pressed their lips to her
      hand, but no one ventured to offer a word of comfort.
    
    
      The queen passed straight into the chapel; she was bowed down with grief,
      though she did not shed a tear. That time was passed, and she seemed
      stupefied. One of the nuns approached and asked in the words of the
      psalmist, "My soul, will you not be subject to God?" [312] a
      name="link312" id="link312">"His will be done," replied the queen, in
      a tremulous voice. Prostrating herself before the altar, she remained long
      in prayer. At last the nuns begged her to eat, for she had partaken of no
      food since the night before, and they feared she would faint. She was led
      to her bedroom, but insisted on hearing more prayers, and complained that
      she could not weep, saying "that even that solace was denied her."
    
    
      Her attendants were sent to bed, but two of the nuns passed the night with
      the queen, who moaned and sighed and prayed by turns with scarcely a
      moment's repose. The next night the king's heart was conveyed to Chaillot
      and placed near that of his mother; but by King Louis's order it was
      received so quietly that Mary Beatrice was not excited by it. However, a
      few hours later she assured the abbess that she felt it was near her, and
      spoke a great deal about her dead husband. Among other things, she said:
      "That he had felt his humiliation, and above all the injustice he had
      experienced, very keenly; but that the love of God had changed all his
      calamities into blessings."
    
    
      Mary Beatrice would have liked to pass the rest of her days at Chaillot,
      but she had other duties to perform and many more years to live.
    
    
      In his will King James had directed that he should be buried with his
      ancestors at Westminster Abbey; therefore the queen ordered that the
      funeral service should be performed in France, but that the body should
      remain unburied until the restoration of her son, which she fondly hoped
      would soon take place.
    
    
      It was therefore at the chapel of the Benedictine Monks that the corpse of
      King James remained covered with the pall for many years, until all hope
      for the Stuart family had vanished forever.
    
    
      The queen remained at Chaillot only four days, for her  span
      class="pagenum">[313]children
      needed her at St. Germain, and she returned to them on the nineteenth of
      September.
    
    
      The next day King Louis called on her, and she received him in a darkened
      room hung with black. He tried very hard to console the widowed queen by
      kind offers of protection to her and her son, and insisted upon her
      receiving the same courtesy from his ministers as though she had been
      queen regent really and not only in name.
    
    
      A.D. 1702. However King James's will had given
      her that title, and her first steps was to publish a manifesto in the name
      of her son, setting forth his claim to the crown of Great Britain. It made
      little impression in England, but those who were opposed to King William
      in Scotland were anxious to bring the young king forward. So Lord Belhaven
      was sent to consult the queen as to what was best to do, and told her that
      if only her young son would declare himself a Protestant he should be
      proclaimed King of Scotland without waiting either for the death of
      William or the consent of parliament. Her majesty replied: "That she would
      never be the means of persuading her son to barter his hopes of Heaven for
      a crown." Then Lord Belhaven was willing to compromise, and said, "That if
      the prince would not change his religion, would he not agree that only a
      limited number of Romish priest, should enter his kingdom, and that he
      would make no attempt to alter the established religion?" This the queen
      freely promised in the name of her son, and then the lord declared that he
      and his party would do all in their power to establish King James's heir
      on the throne.
    
    
      Mary Beatrice would have resigned herself to fate if she had not felt
      convinced that her son's rights were denied him so long as any Stuart
      claimed the crown. At the time of the prince's birth, parliament had
      decided that he should succeed his father, James II., and a new interest
      was [314]awakened
      in him on account of the sympathy felt in England for him and his widowed
      mother. Alarmed that such would be the state of affairs, William hired a
      notorious fellow to prove that the Prince of Wales was not the son of
      James II. and Mary Beatrice at all, but that one Mrs. Mary Grey was his
      real mother, who had been murdered in Paris shortly after his birth. A
      copy of the book containing a full account of this matter was presented to
      the lords, the ministers of state, and the lord mayor. Of course this
      statement was utterly false and absurd, and raised the indignation of the
      House of Commons to such a degree that Fuller, the man who got out the
      book, underwent the disgrace of the pillory. But as he had often been
      employed by William III. as a spy and had been punished more than once for
      perjury, he did not sink under the disgrace as an honest man would have
      done.
    
    
      As soon as the news of King James's death reached William III. he was
      prepared with a blow to aim at his orphan cousin that he was determined
      should not fail if he could help it. It was an accusation of high treason,
      in which Mary Beatrice was also included. The bill, as William presented
      it to his parliament, did not designate his uncle's widow as the queen
      dowager, because he had pocketed her dower, and he desired to deprive her
      even of the honors due a royal lady. So she is called "Mary, late wife of
      the late King James."
    
    
      Without describing all the scenes enacted in parliament while this
      disgraceful bill was under consideration, it is only necessary for us to
      know that it passed the House of Lords; but when it was laid before the
      Commons, they pitched it under the table.
    
    
      The very last act of William III. was to affix the royal seal to the bill
      that he had exerted every means to have executed against the young Prince
      of Wales. He was on [315] a name="link315"
      id="link315">his death-bed when it was presented for his signature,
      but controlled his almost paralyzed fingers enough for the accomplishment
      of this last act of hatred.
    
    
      He expired the next day.
    
    
      Mary Beatrice was so ill when this event occurred that no one ventured to
      speak of it in her presence. Her life hung on a thread for many days and
      depended for its continuance on absolute repose. Therefore she could take
      no steps towards claiming the crown of England for her son at the proper
      moment; and by the time she was convalescent her step-daughter Anne was
      peacefully settled on the throne, and all hope for the young prince
      vanished forever. But Simon Fraser, generally called Lord Lovat, had
      proclaimed the prince King of Scotland, in the county of Inverness as soon
      as the death of William III. was known there. When Mary Beatrice was well
      enough to attend to business, this man presented himself at St. Germain as
      the representative of a large party in his native land, and urged the
      queen-mother to send her son to Scotland to fight for his rights. He said
      that an army of twelve thousand men could easily be raised in the
      Highlands, provided the King of France would assist with arms and money,
      and that the Scottish people would spare no efforts if they could only see
      the prince for whom they were to fight in their midst. But Mary Beatrice
      considered her boy too young to undertake such a perilous enterprise; and
      the very thought of the fate that awaited him, should he fall into the
      hands of his enemies, caused her to refuse to let him leave her. Ambition
      was not the leading trait of the fallen queen.
    
    
      A.D. 1703. In the autumn Lord Lovat applied to
      Mary Beatrice again, and represented affairs in Scotland and Ireland as so
      favorable to the interest of the prince that she was thoroughly deceived,
      and without consulting any of her [316] a
      name="link316" id="link316">friends, sold all the jewels she had left,
      and gave the money to this treacherous creature. It was afterwards proved
      that Lovat was the bribed instrument of Queen Anne's cabinet, by whom all
      his expenses had been paid, while he pretended to be serving the Prince of
      Wales. He did a great deal of mischief, but like many knaves, bribed and
      intrigued until he overstepped the mark, and was arrested the next time he
      appeared in France. He was shut up at the Castle of Angoulême, where he
      was kept a close prisoner for several years.
    
    
      A.D. 1704. In August Mary Beatrice attended a
      grand fête at Marli, given by Louis XIV. to celebrate the birth of a
      great-grandson. The King and Princess Louisa were present also, and were
      given the places of honor after their mother, who always sat at the right
      hand of Louis XIV. Poor Mary Beatrice had little heart for festivities of
      any sort, for she was suffering from an incurable malady which often
      compelled her to keep her bed for several days at a time, and her son's
      health was so delicate as to render him a constant source of anxiety to
      her. He was just seventeen years of age, and the Princess Louisa was
      thirteen. The latter had inherited all her mother's grace and beauty, and
      was considered quite an ornament at the French court.
    
    
      A.D. 1705. The young king opened a ball at Marli
      with his sister, and all the time they were dancing the King of France
      stood as a mark of respect. He would have done the same every time had not
      the queen-mother, who sat at his side, persuaded him to sit down.
    
    
      At all the festivals Mary Beatrice was placed between Louis XIV. and her
      son, while Princess Louisa and the immediate members of the French royal
      family occupied seats at the same table. But King Louis was not willing to
      risk more money or men in an attempt to raise an insurrection  span
      class="pagenum">[317]against
      Queen Anne's government in Scotland. Even had he consented to do so, his
      ministers would have opposed it. All this time Godolphin, who in former
      days had felt so proud at being permitted to hand the queen to her chair
      in the royal chapel, was in secret correspondence with Mary Beatrice, and
      constantly flattered her with false hopes. If he had possessed sufficient
      courage to make a demand of Queen Anne and her cabinet for the payment of
      the royal widow's dower and all the money due her that William III. had
      appropriated to his own use, no doubt the claim would have been allowed.
      But fear lest certain crooked acts of his life might be disclosed rendered
      him irresolute and anxious to publicly maintain a neutral ground.
    
    
      A.D. 1706. When the young king completed his
      eighteenth year he was treated by every one at the court of St. Germain as
      their sovereign, though the queen-mother was really the leader there as
      long as she lived. At this period young James began to take some share in
      state affairs, and showed no ordinary ability. He was a great favorite
      with King Louis, who made frequent visits, both public and private at St.
      Germain, and invited the exiles to every fête he gave at Marli,
      Versailles, and Trianon.
    
    
      A.D. 1707. Notwithstanding all her cares, ill
      health, and disappointment, Mary Beatrice lived very pleasantly at St.
      Germain, where on fine summer afternoons she would walk with Louis XIV. in
      the park, attended by the whole court. It was on such occasions that the
      queen-mother would ask any favor that she might require at the hands of
      the monarch, and she was seldom refused. It gratified her to see the
      enjoyment her children derived from the parties of pleasure they
      frequently formed for the purpose of gathering flowers and wild
      strawberries in the neighboring forests, [318] a
      name="link318" id="link318">or of rowing on the Seine to Pontalie. It
      was at that place that the Countess de Grammont lived in a rural château.
      She was a wealthy lady, who had once been one of the celebrated beauties
      at the court of Charles II., and now felt pleased to contribute to the
      happiness of the exiled Stuarts, instead of turning her back on them as
      many had done. She had known the young king and his sister from infancy,
      and when they made excursions with their court to her house nothing gave
      her greater pleasure than to provide banquets and entertainments of every
      description for them.
    
    
      A.D. 1708. The Grande Monarque suddenly changed
      his mind in the spring, and determined to fit out a fleet, headed by the
      young king, for the purpose of making a descent on the coast of Scotland.
      Not a word was said about this matter until all the arrangements were
      completed; but as soon as the exiled king was informed of the project, he
      took hasty leave of his mother and sister and set out for Dunkirk, the
      place of embarkation, ordering his luggage to be sent after him. No sooner
      had he reached the coast than he was attacked by measles, which detained
      him several days. Becoming impatient of delay, he was at last carried on
      board one of the vessels of his fleet; but not before the English had been
      warned of his approach, and were on the lookout for him.
    
    
      Sir George Byng commanded the English fleet, and it is said that he
      captured the "Salisbury," with the prince on board; but this is not
      positively known. If he did, he saved Queen Anne a great deal of
      perplexity by permitting his royal prisoner to sail out of the Frith of
      Forth, where he encountered the French fleet, and return to France, for
      her majesty certainly would not have known what to do with him.
    
    
      The prince returned to St. Germain, but several persons
    
    
      [319]
    
    
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Original
    
    
      [321]of
      high rank were captured and sent to the Tower to await their trial for
      treason. Mary Beatrice wrote to the French minister, begging him to do
      what he could for the prisoners, by representing them as officers in the
      service of King Louis. But meanwhile Queen Anne's cabinet set a price on
      the head of "the pretended Prince of Wales," as they designated the young
      man. Queen Anne herself went further, and gave him the title of "the
      Pretender" in her address to parliament, knowing that such a name would do
      more to injure his claim to the throne than anything else.
    
    
      Shortly after his return from his unsuccessful attempt to invade Scotland,
      the young prince entered the French army, and served in the Low Countries
      as a volunteer, under the command of the Duke de Vendôme, who esteemed him
      very highly. As he had not the means to equip a camp in accordance with
      his rank, the prince called himself the Chevalier de St. George, that
      being the order with which his royal father had invested him when he was
      only four years old.
    
    
      A.D. 1709. The French met with dreadful defeat
      at Malplaquet. The Chevalier de St. George fought manfully, and made
      twelve charges at the head of the French troops, under a continuous fire
      of six hours from the British. His right arm received a sabre cut, but he
      did not shrink from his duty; and when the general sent despatches
      containing an account of the battle, he added: "The Chevalier de St.
      George behaved himself during the whole action with the utmost valor and
      energy." Mary Beatrice felt very proud of her son, and returned to St.
      Germain with her daughter to meet him, after having passed several weeks
      in complete seclusion at Chaillot convent.
    
    
      A.D. 1710. The chevalier made a third campaign
      with the French army, but returned in bad health and spirits,  span
      class="pagenum">[322]and spent
      the following winter with his mother and sister, keeping up their separate
      courts at St. Germain, as well as their poverty would admit. In the spring
      he made a tour of France; and during his absence Mary Beatrice retired to
      Chaillot again, where she was really happier than when compelled to
      observe court ceremonies. While there the royal family of France did not
      desert her, for they made her frequent visits, which she returned with her
      daughter, though it cost her a struggle each time she went to court. She
      always appeared in her widow's weeds; but the princess went in full court
      costume.
    
    
      A.D. 1711. Shortly after her son's return, Mary
      Beatrice received a letter from her old friend, de Lauzun, informing her
      that peace between France and England would probably soon be established,
      and, if so, Louis XIV. could no longer acknowledge the title or cause of
      her son. This was sad news indeed, but the poor queen bore it calmly; and
      upon the heels of this report came assurance from Marlborough that the
      recall of the prince seemed certain to take place soon. Thus between hope
      and despair Mary Beatrice was kept in a constant state of excitement.
    
    
      When we recall the vicissitudes of the queen-mother's life, our admiration
      of her courage and resignation is changed to surprise that her strength
      did not succumb, when in her advanced years she was called upon to bear a
      cruel blow, caused by the death of the darling and pride of her heart, the
      Princess Louisa.
    
    
      A.D. 1712. This beautiful, affectionate, devoted
      daughter died of small-pox in April, and her brother was ill of the same
      disease when she was taken. The English at St. Germain were not more
      disconsolate than were the French at Versailles on account of the death of
      this young girl, whose charming qualities had rendered her a general
      favorite. But what must have been the agony of the poor  span
      class="pagenum">[323]mother,
      who, after being deprived of the chief solace of her old age, saw her son
      recover only to be separated from her by the stern decree of
      circumstances? The negotiations of peace between France and England
      required the prince to withdraw entirely from the French dominions, and
      this had only been delayed on account of his illness.
    
    
      Well, the time came at last when the Chevalier de St. George was compelled
      to leave St. Germain, and his poor mother was so unhappy at parting with
      him that she went to Chaillot, where, in company of the nuns, she hoped to
      find comfort and resignation. She arrived at the convent at seven o'clock
      in the evening, and burst into tears as she passed through the gate,
      saying: "This is the first time that I feel no joy in coming to this holy
      spot; but, my God, I ask not consolation, but the accomplishment of thy
      divine will!"
    
    
      She sat down to supper, but ate nothing; and when she retired to her
      chamber, attended by the three nuns who waited on her, she exclaimed: "At
      last I may give liberty to my heart and weep for my poor girl." The nuns
      could not speak, their tears flowed in sympathy with their royal visitor,
      who said several times between her sobs, "My God, thy will be done," and
      then added: "Thou hast not waited for my death to despoil me: thou hast
      done it during my life; but thy will be done."
    
    
      The next day Mary Beatrice was so ill that her physicians had to be
      summoned; and as she continued to grow worse, it was feared that she would
      die at the convent; however, after a few days she recovered.
    
    
      On the very day that the truce with England was proclaimed in Paris the
      Chevalier de St. George went over from Livry to bid farewell to his
      mother. He met her at the church door as she came out; and as he had just
      been bled in the foot,       a form of medical treatment very popular
      [324]in
      those days,       he was lame and leaned on his cane for support. Mary
      Beatrice was suffering from an attack of gout, which obliged her also to
      make use of a cane; and the mother and son laughed heartily at the
      coincidence. The abbess said to the chevalier, "Sire, we hope your majesty
      will do us the honor to dine with us, as your royal uncle, King Charles,
      breakfasted when setting out for England."
    
    
      "That journey will not be yet for me," he replied, drily.
    
    
      September 7 was fixed for the chevalier's departure from Paris, and he
      went again to the convent on the previous day to bid a long farewell to
      his mother, whom he commended to the care of the nuns and her confessor,
      Father Ruga. Three days later he arrived at the French border, where he
      was to stop until his future residence should be decided upon.
    
    
      Mary Beatrice remained at the convent, where she was visited from time to
      time by the most distinguished people of France; and the king sent her
      presents of game, fruit, and flowers.
    
    
      A.D 1713. A letter from the chevalier, written
      at the beginning of the following year, informed his mother that he had
      been most affectionately received at Bar-le-duc by the Duke and Duchess of
      Lorraine. The latter was a relation, being descended from James I., so it
      was very pleasing to the queen to hear that any one in whose veins ran
      Stuart blood should be kind to her son.
    
    
      It was a sad day for the exiled queen when the peace of Utrecht was
      signed, for one of the articles stated: "That, to insure forever the peace
      and repose of Europe and of England, the King of France recognized for
      himself and his successors the Protestant line of Hanover, and agreed that
      he who had taken the title of King of Great Britain should remain no
      longer in France."
    
    
      Mary Beatrice knew that it grieved King Louis to banish  span
      class="pagenum">[325]her son,
      but he was forced by the turn political affairs had taken to do it.
    
    
      The Jacobites, as the opponents of William and Mary were called in
      England, never gave up the hope of seeing "the king over the water"       a
      name they had given to the Chevalier de St. George       restored to the
      throne, and many of them went to France from time to time on purpose to
      pay their respects to the queen-mother.
    
    
      At the close of the year a report reached Mary Beatrice that her son was
      about to renounce the Catholic faith and become a member of the Church of
      England; but a letter from him reassured her on that score, for he wrote:
      "I doubt not that the reports which are in circulation of my having
      changed my religion have reached you, but you know me too well to be
      alarmed; and I can assure you that, with the grace of God, you will sooner
      see me dead than out of the church."
    
    
      There was a great deal of distress at St. Germain on account of poverty;
      and as it was the loyal and faithful followers of Mary Beatrice who
      actually suffered the pangs of hunger at times, she was sorely afflicted
      on their account.
    
    
      A.D. 1714. At last a small part of the money due
      her in England was ordered to be paid by Queen Anne, which relieved the
      wants of many for the time; but it was all Mary Beatrice ever received
      from that quarter, and by no means freed her from debt.
    
    
      Shortly after this beneficent act Queen Anne died, and the moment the
      Chevalier de St. George heard it he travelled post-haste, incognito, to
      Paris to consult with his mother and other friends, having made up his
      mind to proceed at once to England to assert his claim to the throne. The
      Duke de Lauzun had hired a small house at Chaillot in his own name for the
      reception of the royal adventurer, [326] a
      name="link326" id="link326">and thither Mary Beatrice went to meet
      him. He did not dare to venture near St. Germain, because he was too well
      known there, and preferred to keep his presence in France secret until he
      could ascertain what Louis XIV. would decide to do. That monarch had
      already paid dearly for the sympathy he had shown the royal widow and her
      son; besides, France was in no condition to maintain another war, so his
      majesty sent his minister, De Torcy, to persuade the Chevalier de St.
      George to return at once to Lorraine, and ordered at the same time that in
      case of refusal the young claimant of the British crown was to be
      compelled to leave France immediately.
    
    
      Utterly destitute of money, ships, or men, the prince was powerless to
      take any stand, and meanwhile George I. was proclaimed King of England.
    
    
      Louis XIV. had yielded to the urgent entreaties of Mary Beatrice in behalf
      of her son in so far as to command arms to be furnished for ten thousand
      men, and ships to transport them to Scotland, but before these
      arrangements were completed his majesty died.
    
    
      A.D. 1715. Then a formidable insurrection broke
      out in Scotland, and King James III., as well as Mary, the queen-mother,
      were prayed for in the churches. When Mary Beatrice heard this she was in
      an agony of suspense, because she had had no news of her son for nearly
      three weeks. She knew that he had left Lorraine, and vague reports had
      reached her of his being in different parts of France in disguise, when
      suddenly one day he appeared before her at Chaillot in the habit of a
      monk. The chevalier spent only twenty-four hours with his mother, and then
      bade her farewell to set out on a journey fraught with danger. Spies were
      everywhere, and the identity of the strange monk was soon made known to
      his enemies. He started from Chaillot in one of the post carriages
      belonging to the Baron de [327] a
      name="link327" id="link327">Breteul, a warm partisan of the Stuarts.
      The chevalier was still disguised as a monk, and travelled attended by
      some horsemen who wore the livery of his friend, the baron. At the village
      of Nonancourt a shabbily dressed old woman stopped the carriage, and going
      close up to the door said to the disguised occupant: "If you are the King
      of England go not to the post-house or you are lost, for several villains
      are waiting there to murder you."
    
    
      Knowing that a bribe of a hundred thousand pounds had been set on his head
      by the British government, the chevalier dared not disregard such a piece
      of intelligence, but he questioned the woman further. She told him that
      her name was L'Hopital, and added: "I am a lone woman, mistress of the
      post-house of Nonancourt; I warn you not to approach, because I overheard
      three Englishmen discussing with some desperate characters of this
      neighborhood a design to kill a traveller who was to change horses with me
      to-night on his way to Château Thierry. I drugged their wine, and now they
      are so intoxicated that I locked them in the house, and came to conduct
      you to the cottage of our curate, where you will be safe."
    
    
      The chevalier was struck by the woman's earnestness and simplicity, and
      resigned himself to her guidance. Having conducted him and his attendants
      to the house of the village pastor, L'Hopital summoned the magistrate,
      who, after hearing her story, arrested the three men and shut them up in
      prison. Two of them proved to be Englishmen and the third a well known
      French spy.
    
    
      The next morning the worthy post-mistress sent the chevalier forward in
      another disguise, with fresh horses that soon carried him to Nantes, where
      a vessel awaited him, in which he descended the Loire to St. Malo. Finding
      an English squadron on the watch for him, the royal adventurer, attended
      by six gentlemen, all dressed as French [328] a
      name="link328" id="link328">naval officers, rode on horseback to
      Dunkirk, where they embarked on a small vessel and arrived at Perth, in
      Scotland, on the seventh of December.
    
    
      Meanwhile Mary Beatrice had a severe attack of illness, occasioned by
      anxiety on her son's account, for she never heard of his arrival on
      British soil until he had been gone nearly two months.
    
    
      Without entering into all the painful details of this expedition, it is
      only necessary for us to say that, although the Scotch rejoiced at the
      idea of having "the auld Stuarts back again," it resulted, as usual, in
      defeat.
    
    
      A.D. 1716. The Chevalier de St. George returned
      to France in disguise as before, and spent several days with his mother,
      although his presence on French soil was interdicted, as we know. To have
      her son under the same roof with her once more was a satisfaction for
      which Mary Beatrice had scarcely dared to hope; but her pleasure was
      short-lived, for the very morning after she had embraced him Lord
      Bolingbroke, his private secretary, waited on the chevalier to advise his
      immediate return to Bar. Etiquette required him to ask permission of the
      Duke of Lorraine, and as it would require several days to receive an
      answer from that kinsman, the chevalier repaired to Châlons rather than
      risk a longer stay on forbidden ground. His unsuccessful enterprise in
      Scotland had rendered his position much worse than it had been before with
      regard to the European powers, for they dared not offer him an asylum.
      Even his former friend, the Duke of Lorraine, refused to receive him, and
      he was advised to go to Sweden, but the spot he fixed upon was the
      beautiful town of Avignon.
    
    
      Although the Regent Orleans would neither grant assistance to the
      Chevalier de St. George nor permit him to remain in France, he treated the
      widowed queen with every mark of veneration. The British ambassador had
      remonstrated [329] a name="link329"
      id="link329">against her being allowed to remain at St. Germain, but
      she was too much loved and pitied by all classes of people for the regent
      to consent to her removal, even had he desired it. Therefore, to her dying
      day Mary Beatrice maintained the state and title of queen dowager of
      England, and lived undisturbed at the royal château that King Louis XIV.
      had placed at her disposal when, as a fugitive, she had sought his
      protection many years ago.
    
    
      A.D. 1718. But the weary pilgrimage of poor Mary
      Beatrice was drawing to a close. Her last illness attacked her in April,
      and by the beginning of the following month she knew that her end was
      near. She desired to receive the last sacraments of the church, and
      afterwards took leave of all her faithful friends and attendants, thanking
      them for their services, and desiring all present "to pray for her and for
      the king, her son, that he might serve God faithfully all his life." This
      she repeated in a louder tone, fearing that every one in the room, which
      was full of people, might not have heard.
    
    
      The dying queen asked to see Marshal Villeroi, the governor of the young
      King of France, and when he appeared at her bedside sent an earnest appeal
      to the Regent Orleans and Louis XV., in behalf of her son, whom she was to
      see no more. She also recommended her dependants to their care, and begged
      that the regent would not let them perish for want in a foreign land when
      she was gone.
    
    
      The next day the good queen expired, in the sixtieth year of her age and
      the thirtieth of her exile. She had borne her sorrows and misfortunes with
      true heroism to the last, and her death was worthy of her life.
    
    
      When the mother of the Regent Orleans announced to her German relatives
      that Mary Beatrice was dead, she added: "She never in her life did wrong
      to any one; if [330] a name="link330"
      id="link330">you were about to tell her a story about a person, she
      always said: 'If it be any ill, I beg you not to relate it to me; I do not
      like histories which attack the reputation.'" It would be well for us who
      live in a more civilized age to lay this lesson to heart, and emulate the
      pious example of Mary Beatrice.

      CHAPTER X. MARY II., QUEEN-REGENT OF GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND.
    
    
      (A.D. 1662-1695.)
    
    
      Lady Mary of York,
      as this queen was styled in her youth, was a person of small importance,
      so far as any prospect of her ever occupying the throne was concerned, for
      this reason: She was the daughter of James, Duke of York, second son of
      Charles I. and Henrietta Maria, whose history we have related.
    
    
      Charles II. succeeded his father and married Catharine of Braganza, just
      at the time when Lady Mary was born, and everybody supposed that his
      children would be next in the line of succession. So they would have been
      if he had ever been blessed with any, but as he was not, his brother
      James, the luckless king of whom the last reign contains an account,
      mounted the throne, and then his daughters attained an importance that
      would not otherwise have been theirs.
    
    
      The Duke of York's first wife was Anne Hyde, daughter of Clarendon, the
      lord chancellor, and as she was not of royal birth, a great deal of
      discontent was occasioned on all sides. However, the marriage had been
      secretly solemnized before any engagement was suspected, so it would have
      been useless for any one to say much against it.
    
    
      Lady Mary was born at St. James's Palace, only a couple of weeks before
      her uncle's marriage; so the public mind was occupied with preparations
      for the reception of the new bride; and the infant came into the world as
      quietly. [334]as
      though she had not been of royal blood. She was sent to her grandfather's
      house at Twickenham, where her nursery was established; and being a very
      beautiful, engaging child, she was no doubt indulged and fondled more than
      was good for her. She had a little brother born when she was not more than
      a year and a half old; but he died within a short time. Lady Anne of York,
      the subject of the next reign, was born when Mary was three years of age,
      and the elder sister stood sponsor at the baptism of the infant.
    
    
      The Duke of York was so fond of Lady Mary that he kept her in his arms all
      the time when he was at Twickenham, or when she was taken on a visit at
      St. James's Palace. Pepys, a literary gentleman, who published a most
      interesting diary of his times! says: "I was on business with the Duke of
      York, and with great pleasure saw him play with his little girl just like
      an ordinary private father." So we can easily imagine the romping and
      merry sounds that must have enlivened the nursery when the duke made his
      visits.
    
    
      Shortly after the birth of Anne, the royal father returned from his first
      grand naval victory, and found the Great Plague raging to such an extent
      that he at once removed his wife and children to York. That place had the
      double advantage of pure air, and of being in the neighborhood of the
      duke's fleet, that was cruising off the northeast coast to keep an eye on
      the Dutch ships.
    
    
      The Duchess of York had everything about her very splendid in her northern
      home, and was so happy there that when her husband was summoned elsewhere
      she preferred not to accompany him. No doubt this lady had faults,       who
      has not?       but her most prominent one was an excessive love of eating.
      This would have harmed no one but herself; therefore we should not have
      recorded it, [335] a name="link335"
      id="link335">if it had not been transmitted to her children. Both of
      the daughters carried this weakness even further than their mother did,
      and she was injudicious enough to indulge them. As a natural consequence
      the children accumulated an unhealthy quantity of fat, and, of course,
      became victims of indigestion. Anne was a regular rolly-poly as a child;
      but as there is a separate chapter devoted to her we must confine the
      present story, as much as possible, to the elder sister.
    
    
      Ladies Mary and Anne pursued their education under the direction of Lady
      Frances Villiers, daughter of the Earl of Suffolk and wife of Sir Edward
      Villiers. This-lady had six daughters of her own, and must have had her
      hands full with the care of eight girls. She lived with them at the old
      palace at Richmond, where Queen Elizabeth died, and her daughters grew up
      with the princesses, and formed a connection that lasted through life.
      Being deprived of their mother when they were, respectively, six and nine
      years of age, Mary and Anne naturally clung to the companions who shared
      their education and to the lady who superintended it.
    
    
      A.D. 1671. When the Duchess of York died she
      left four children, two of whom were sons; but they followed her to the
      grave within the year. By that time the succession of the Princess Mary to
      the throne of England began to assume an air of probability, because, as
      we have said, no children were born to Charles II. The duchess had become
      a convert to Catholicism, and not very long after her death the duke was
      suspected of having likewise joined that faith. This made him so unpopular
      that the services he had performed for his country were all forgotten, and
      his marriage, rather more than two years afterwards, with the Catholic
      Princess of Modena, only served to increase the censure he had drawn down
      on his own head. [336] a name="link336"
      id="link336">Fearing that his nieces might be influenced by their
      father's faith, King Charles undertook the supervision of their education
      himself, and engaged Henry Compton, Bishop of London, for their preceptor.
      This man had been a soldier until he was thirty years old, when he became
      a clergyman, and was rapidly promoted on account of the loyalty of his
      family. Compton was good enough as a man, but by no means a well-informed
      one, consequently the princesses were not taught as they ought to have
      been. People who have not had advantages of education themselves often
      know its importance; but this does not seem to have been the case with
      Compton, for his pupils were allowed to study or not, just as their fancy
      dictated. The consequence was that the elder sister, having inherited the
      literary tastes of her parents, studied because it pleased her to do so;
      while Lady Anne grew up an ignoramus because she did not so please. If the
      governess, Lady Frances Villiers, had done her duty faithfully, this would
      not have been the case; but her tastes lay in a different direction.
    
    
      Peter de Laine was the French professor of the princesses, and made Lady
      Mary so perfect a mistress of that language that she wrote it better than
      her native tongue. Mr. and Mrs. Gibson gave instruction in drawing. They
      were a pair of dwarfs, neither being more than three feet six inches in
      height, and were considered among the best English artists of the day.
      This little couple had nine full-grown children, and lived to a good old
      age.
    
    
      The ladies Mary and Anne continued to live at Richmond with Lady Villiers
      and her daughters after their mother's death, and were very religiously
      trained according to the requirements of the Church of England. One day in
      the year the Duke of York's entire family always observed as one of deep
      sorrow, fasting, and prayer; it was [337] a
      name="link337" id="link337">the thirtieth of January, memorable as
      having been the date of Charles I.'s execution. Each year all matters of
      business or pleasure were laid aside on that day, and the family appeared
      in deep mourning garments.
    
    
      A.D. 1674. Mrs. Betterton, the principal actress
      at the King's Theatre, was engaged to teach the royal sisters a ballet,
      which they performed at court, and the lessons she also imparted in
      elocution proved of great service when, as queens, they had speeches to
      make. Both the princesses were attractive in personal appearance, though
      they did not resemble each other; for Lady Mary was a Stuart in looks,
      tall, graceful, slender, with a clear complexion, dark eyes and hair,
      while Anne had her mother's round face and plump figure. Her hair was dark
      brown, complexion ruddy, features clear cut and regular, and she had
      beautiful hands and arms. Being somewhat near-sighted, Princess Anne had a
      drawn look about the eyes that detracted from her beauty. Perhaps it was
      this defect that prevented her studying as much as she ought to have done;
      but certain it is that she never opened a book when she could avoid it;
      but she was a good musician and played well on the guitar. At a very early
      age Anne excelled in card-playing, and, I regret to add, gossip. But this
      was the fault of King Charles's court, at which both the princesses were
      introduced when they ought to have been still at school. Lady Mary played
      cards as well as her sister, and for very high stakes, but, what was
      worse, she employed Sunday evenings as well as those of the week in this
      frivolous manner. Nobody tried to correct this bad habit, because gambling
      was the chief pastime at the English court, and had been so since the time
      of Henry VIII.
    
    
      A.D. 1677. When Lady Mary was fifteen years old
      King Charles and his councillors began to look about for a husband for
      her, and decided that her cousin, William [338] a
      name="link338" id="link338">Henry, Prince of Orange, would be the best
      person for her to marry. Then that young man was first consulted on the
      subject; his mind was so filled with war and exploits on the battle-field
      that he appeared indifferent almost to rudeness; but later, when he
      thought that the influence of his uncles, Charles II. and the Duke of
      York, might be of advantage in a political point of view, he went to
      England to see what his chances then might be with the presumptive
      heiress, Mary. This prince was the son of King Charles's sister Mary, who
      died when her boy was nine years of age, and left him to the care of his
      grandmother, his father having been killed at sea before he was born. He
      was an undersized, delicate boy of nineteen the first time he went to
      England to claim the protection of his uncles, who made some plans by
      which he was secured the Stadt-holdership of Holland. That was in 1670; he
      was twenty-six when he returned on his matrimonial expedition, and not
      much improved either in health or appearance. Prince William had a little
      plan of his own which prevented his discussing his affairs in a
      straightforward manner at his first interview with King Charles. He was at
      war with France, and felt no desire to make peace unless forced to do so.
      Should he wed the Princess of England, he counted on assistance from her
      father to pursue hostilities, but he would not commit himself until he had
      seen the lady; for although he was by no means good-looking himself, he
      was determined to have a handsome wife.
    
    
      He was so well pleased with the Princess Mary that after his introduction
      to her by King Charles, he immediately asked her hand in marriage. It was
      granted on condition that the terms of a peace with France should first be
      agreed upon. The prince excused himself, and declared "that he must end
      his marriage before he began his peace treaty;" then added "that his
      allies would be apt to believe [339] a
      name="link339" id="link339">that he had made his match at their cost,
      and for his part, he would never sell his honor for a wife."
    
    
      But the king remained obstinate for three or four days; then Sir William
      Temple sought his presence and repeated this message sent to his majesty
      by the Prince of Orange, who was in a very bad humor. It was: "That he
      repented ever coming to England, and that after two days he would go back
      home if the king continued in the mind he was of treating of the peace
      before his marriage, and that the king must choose whether they were to
      live afterwards as the greatest friends or the greatest enemies, for it
      must be one or the other."
    
    
      The easy-going Charles, who was always for letting everybody have his own
      way, replied: "Well, I never yet was deceived in judging of a man's
      honesty by his looks; and if I am not deceived in the prince's face, he is
      the honestest man in the world. I will trust him       he shall
      have his wife. You go, Sir William Temple, and tell my brother that I have
      resolved it shall be so."
    
    
      The Duke of York was surprised at the suddenness of the message, but
      replied: "The king shall be obeyed, and I would be glad if all his
      subjects would learn of me to obey him. I tell him my opinion very freely
      upon all things; but when I know his positive pleasure on a point I obey."
    
    
      The Prince of Orange was delighted at his uncle Charles's decision, and
      that very evening the match was announced at the cabinet council. After
      having dined at Whitehall Palace, the Duke of York returned to St.
      James's, where he was then living with his family, and leading his
      daughter Mary into a private room, told her how it was arranged that she
      was to marry Prince William of Orange. The poor girl burst into tears and
      felt very unhappy, but no one cared anything about that; and although her
      heart was very heavy [340] a name="link340"
      id="link340">she had to stand by her betrothed for several succeeding
      days to receive deputations from the city officials, law students,
      commercial companies, and others who came to offer congratulations. A
      grand banquet was given by the citizens of London to evince their pleasure
      at this Protestant marriage, and on the same day the Princess Mary, with
      her sister Anne, and her stepmother, Mary of Modena, sat under a canopy of
      state and witnessed a fine procession.
    
    
      The marriage was solemnized on the fourth of November in the bride's
      bed-chamber at St. James's Palace, only the members of the royal family
      being present. King Charles tried to draw attention from his niece's
      excessive sadness by rollicking gayety, quite out of place on so solemn an
      occasion; and when the Prince of Orange endowed his bride with all his
      earthly goods, placing a handful of gold and silver coins on the open
      book, the king told his niece "to gather it up and put it in her pocket,
      for't was all clear gain." After the ceremony the court and foreign
      ambassadors were admitted to offer congratulations. Next morning Prince
      William gave his bride a present of jewels to the amount of forty thousand
      pounds.
    
    
      This marriage was very popular in Scotland, where, as well as in England,
      all the festivities and rejoicings customary on such occasions were
      observed. The groom displayed great ill-humor when the duchess had a son
      born a couple of days later, because the little fellow would have had the
      precedency over his wife in the succession, but, as we know, he lived only
      a few weeks. It made Princess Mary no happier to find herself united to a
      surly man, and what added to her distress at this time was the illness of
      her sister Anne, who was suffering from small-pox, and could neither be
      present at her wedding nor take leave of her when, a week later, she
      departed for Holland. The

      [343]prince
      wanted to get his wife away from St. James's as soon as possible lest she
      might catch the infection; but she would not leave her father until the
      dreaded moment of sailing arrived. This made the groom so angry that
      everybody spoke of how cross and ugly he was, and the maids-of-honor of
      the queen called him the "Dutch monster," and other horrid names. He was
      angry with the wind, too, because it would continue to blow in the wrong
      direction, and keep him in England longer than he desired. Several people
      were lying dangerously ill at St. James's Palace; two or three had died
      since the wedding; Anne continued too ill to see her sister, and all was
      gloom and sorrow around the bride. At last, on the nineteenth of November,
      the wind changed, and the two palaces of Whitehall and St. James were at
      once bustle and confusion with preparations for the departure of the
      Princess of Orange and her husband. At nine o'clock in the morning the
      bride bade farewell to her old home and went to Whitehall to embrace her
      royal aunt, Queen Catharine, whom she loved very dearly. It was then that
      the queen told her to consider how much better her case was than her own,
      for when she came from Portugal she had not even seen King Charles, and
      Mary replied between her sobs: "But, madame, remember you came into
      England, I am going out of England." The king and the Duke of York, with a
      large party of nobility and gentry, embarked-on the royal barges at
      Whitehall and accompanied the Prince and Princess of Orange down the river
      to Erith, where they were to dine. Then Mary parted with her father and
      uncle and set sail for Holland, several English and Dutch men-of-war being
      in attendance to conduct the royal yacht across the sea. If the Duke of
      York had known his son-in-law as well at that time as he did later, he
      would have set a watch on his movements until he was well out of the
      kingdom; but an [344] a name="link344"
      id="link344">unfavorable shifting of the wind gave the ambitious
      prince a chance of playing a mean trick on the duke, who on hearing that
      the Dutch fleet was detained at Sheerness, sent a messenger to invite the
      bride and groom to pass the time at Whitehall. William declined, but went
      ashore with his wife and became the guest of Colonel Dorrell, the
      governor. Next day they proceeded to Canterbury, accompanied by Lady
      Inchiquin (one of the Villiers girls), a maid, and the prince's two
      favorites, Bentinck and Odyke. Arriving at the inn, the prince applied to
      the city authorities for a loan, saying that he had been sent away from
      London in haste without a penny, because King Charles and the Duke of York
      were so jealous of any favor shown him that they were afraid the lord
      mayor would give him a grand feast, and hurried him off to prevent it. As
      we know the entertainment was given, and the prince and princess, as well
      as the rest of the royal family were present, of course the statement was
      false, and by refusing the loan the corporation of Canterbury showed very
      plainly that they considered it so. But Doctor Tillotson, the Dean of
      Canterbury, gathered together all the plate and ready money he could
      command, and hastened with them to the inn, where he requested an
      interview with Mr. Bentinck, and not only placed all his wealth at the
      disposal of the prince, but offered him an asylum at the deanery, a more
      proper stopping-place for one of his rank than a common inn. The money and
      plate were accepted, but the offer of hospitality was declined. Now, it
      was perfectly useless for Prince William to demand money from any one but
      his uncles, who would have supplied him without hesitation. Besides, as
      the first instalment of Princess Mary's portion of forty thousand pounds
      had been paid, his credit was perfectly good in London, and the prime
      minister, Danby, would not have been applied to in vain. But the prince
      was so [345]angry
      on account of the birth of his little brother-in-law that he wanted to
      appear in the light of a very ill-used person, and this game was a bold
      political stroke to obtain partisans before leaving the country. And he
      succeeded, for Dr. Tillotson became a serviceable friend, who corresponded
      with the prince and Mr. Bentinck, and gave them some valuable information
      for which he was made an archbishop a few years later. Four days the
      Prince of Orange devoted to courting favor with the people of Kent, and
      then set sail on board the "Montague" at Margate.
    
    
      The princess was accompanied by Lady Inchiquin and her two sisters,
      Elizabeth and Anne Villiers, whose mother had died just after they bade
      her adieu at Richmond Palace. These were ladies-of-honor, and there was
      still another, named Mary Worth. After a very stormy passage, during which
      everybody was sea-sick excepting Princess Mary, the royal fleet arrived at
      Tethudo, a town on the Holland coast, and their majesties proceeded to
      Hounslardyke Palace. The preparations for their reception went forward so
      slowly that they could not make their public entry into the Hague until
      the end of a fortnight, but everything was arranged with great
      magnificence. The bridge at the entrance of the town was festooned with
      garlands of flowers, surrounding appropriate Latin inscriptions, and
      twelve companies of soldiers were drawn up in line on either side.
      Twenty-four virgins, in gay costumes, walked two and two on either side of
      their highnesses' coach, strewing fresh flowers and evergreens in the path
      all the way. In front of the town hall was a triumphal arch hung with
      banners, ferns, and gay ribbons, displaying the crests of the prince and
      princess side by side, and over them two hands holding a Latin motto,
      which, rendered into English, read thus:       
    
    
      
    
    
      "What Halcyon airs this royal Hymen sings,
    
    
      The Olive branch of peace her dower she brings."
    
    
      
    
    
      [346]The
      royal cortège passed beneath this arch on to Hoog-straet, where another
      bore this inscription:       
    
    
      
    
    
      "To the Batavian court, with Heaven's best smile,
    
    
      Approach fair guest, and bless this happy pile."
    
    
      
    
    
      And so with a fine display of loyalty from their subjects, that greeted
      their eyes and ears at every turn,       for there was music, the beating
      of drums, and ringing of bells besides,       the royal pair passed
      through the principal streets to their palace.
    
    
      That evening there were brilliant fireworks representing, in turn, St.
      George on horseback, fountains, pyramids, enormous castles, chariots
      containing the gods descending from the skies in a blaze of fire,
      flower-pots, animals, and a variety of novel devices. The following day
      all the "Herrs" of note called to pay their respects, but it is not
      necessary for us to recall the long unpronounceable names. The usual
      celebrations followed, and after that Princess Mary resorted to her old
      propensity for gambling, in which she was encouraged by her husband, who
      carried this vice further than she did.
    
    
      Not long after the arrival of the Princess of Orange, as we must call her
      now, the Archbishop of Canterbury recommended Dr. Hooper for her almoner
      and chaplain. On his arrival in Holland he found the princess without a
      chapel or a room of any kind that could be put to that use, except the
      dining-room. This she willingly relinquished, because she and the prince
      never took their meals together, and for the sake of obliging Dr. Hooper
      she was willing to dine in a small, dark parlor, which, though not very
      comfortable, answered the purpose. Dr. Hooper was ordered to fit up the
      chapel; but so alarmed was the princess lest she might suffer from having
      incurred her lord's displeasure, that she insisted upon the almoner's
      being present on a certain afternoon, when his majesty was
    
    
      [347]
    
    
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Original
    
    
      [349]to
      inspect the arrangements, to bear part of the brunt of his ill-nature. The
      first thing he did on entering the chapel was to turn up his nose
      contemptuously, kick over the chair placed on the steps of the dias tor
      his wife, and ask roughly for whom it was intended. Then he inquired the
      use of each article that struck his notice, and with an emphatic "Hum!"
      left the chapel, which he entered only once or twice after that. The
      princess attended every day, taking great pains not to make the chaplain
      wait. The prince had given his wife certain religious books to read, which
      Dr. Hooper replaced with those he preferred for her. This excited the
      prince's displeasure, and one day on finding her deeply interested in a
      work not in accordance with his belief, he stormed furiously, and said:
      "What!       will you read such books? I suppose it is Dr. Hooper
      persuades you to do it."
    
    
      While the Princess of Orange was under the good influence of Dr. Hooper,
      her sister Anne had established her little court at St. James's, and
      passed most of her time gambling and gossiping. Her most intimate friend
      was Sarah Jennings, who, at the age of fifteen, had secretly married the
      handsome Colonel Churchill, the Duke of York's favorite gentleman. This
      lady afterwards became the Duchess of Marlborough, a very important
      personage in the political world. Her tastes were similar to those of the
      Princess Anne, over whom she had a very baneful influence. Barbara
      Villiers, now Mrs. Berkley, third daughter of her late governess, was
      Anne's first lady-inwaiting; thus we see four of the ladies of this family
      in direct attendance upon the two princesses who later occupied the
      British throne.
    
    
      But to return to Holland. At the Hague the Princess of Orange found three
      beautiful palaces. One was called "the Hague," a splendid Gothic
      structure, where all the [350] a
      name="link350" id="link350">business of state was transacted. Mary
      never went there, excepting, on occasions of great ceremony. About a mile
      from this castle stood the palace in the wood, surrounded by stately oaks
      and one of the most beautiful gardens in the whole of Europe. That was the
      home of the Princess of Orange. A long avenue formed by two rows of
      wide-spreading trees, whose branches met and formed a canopy overhead, led
      to the main door of the palace, and clean, freshly gravelled walks wound
      in and out to the utmost limit of the well-kept grounds. Not far off was a
      dower palace, called the Old Court. A paved walk, also bordered with fine
      old trees, trimmed in the shape of pyramids, led from the Hague to the
      seaport of Scheveling; and, as this was open to the public, every
      passenger had to pay a small toll to keep it in good order.
    
    
      But the English attendants who had accompanied the princess wanted
      something besides a beautiful residence; they were not pleased with their
      new home, and longed for England and the old scenes and old faces they had
      left behind them. The princess was fortunate in having her uncle, Lord
      Clarendon, with her. He was ambassador at the Hague when she first
      arrived; and, as her husband was called away shortly after, it was most
      agreeable to have her uncle's protection.
    
    
      A.D. 1678. The Prince of Orange returned from
      hunting one day, and after reading a few letters announced his intention
      to proceed at once to France. The princess accompanied her husband as far
      as Rotterdam, and then bade him farewell.
    
    
      During his absence the princess made a tour of her dominions, moving from
      place to place in her barge by canal. While travelling in this primitive
      manner, the ladies of the court amused themselves with needlework or
      card-playing; and when Princess Mary sewed, Dr. Hooper would read
    
    
      [351]
    
    
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Original
    
    
      [353]from
      some serious work. Although not seventeen years of age at that time, the
      princess managed her ladies remarkably well. She never showed more favor
      to one than another; insisted on the observance of every point of
      etiquette, and exercised so much authority that a look from her was
      sufficient to put a stop to any conversation that did not meet with her
      approval. Some years later Dr. Hooper paid her the compliment of saying,
      "that during the entire time of his sojourn in her household,       over a
      year and a half,       he never heard her say or saw her do one thing that
      he could have wished she had not said or done."
    
    
      The climate of Holland did not agree with the princess, and she had a
      dangerous attack of malarial fever the following summer, from which she
      did not entirely recover for many weeks. With the hope of cheering her and
      accelerating her convalescence, the Duke of York sent his wife and his
      daughter Anne to visit her. Princess Mary was beside herself with joy, for
      she had not seen her sister since her marriage, and she had always been
      the best of friends with her stepmother. The Duchess of York called her
      "the Lemon," and her husband "the Orange": and most of her letters to Mary
      before the revolution began "My dear Lemon."
    
    
      A.D. 1679. The following year the Duke of York
      was banished from England on account of his religion, and went to visit
      his daughter in Holland, who treated him with the most tender affection.
      Her health was not then entirely restored, for she still suffered from
      attacks of ague, and was ordered to try the climate of Dieren, where her
      husband owned a hunting palace. The change did her a great deal of good,
      and she returned to the Palace of the Wood in time to see Dr. Hooper go
      back to England to marry a lady to whom he had been engaged for many
      months. [354]Mary
      was very much alarmed lest she should lose the services of her almoner,
      and begged him to prevail upon his lady to come to Holland. He promised to
      do his best and succeeded; but it was very mortifying to the princess that
      she was unable to extend her hospitality to Mrs. Hooper. The doctor had
      always taken his meals with the ladies of the bed-chamber and the
      maids-of-honor of the princess, and his wife was invited to do the same.
    
    
      But knowing, as everybody did, that Prince William was too stingy to be
      willing to feed one person more than he was actually obliged to, Dr.
      Hooper never allowed his wife to eat at the palace, but took his meals
      with her at their lodging-house, not far away. Fortunately he was a man of
      means, for as he received only a few pounds from Prince William for all
      his services at the Dutch court he could not otherwise have subsisted.
    
    
      The Princess Mary had another visit from her sister Anne, when she was
      permitted by King Charles to join her father during his banishment; and
      the whole family of the Duke of York spent some time together in Holland
      on the most amicable terms. At that period Mary did not know how her
      husband was intriguing with such men as Sunderland, Oates, and Bedloe, who
      were mixed up in the popish plot, for the purpose of depriving her father
      of his succession, and bringing on her native land the curse of civil war.
      She would have been horrified at such an idea.
    
    
      Princess Mary was not happily married, for her husband was so cross and
      disagreeable that it was impossible for her to love him. Her life was
      almost one of imprisonment, because, although she was condescension itself
      to the wives of the burgomasters and other ladies, she never lost sight of
      her own high birth sufficiently to permit of any intimacy or exchange of
      visits; consequently she was confined to the narrow circle of her own
      court, which was very tiresome [355] a
      name="link355" id="link355">to a woman accustomed to all the pomp,
      grandeur, and gayety of royal life in England.
    
    
      One thing that interested her was the building of a palace by her husband
      at Loo. She laid the corner-stone with all the ceremony that usually
      attends such a performance, and planned the decorations of the building as
      well as the laying out of the gardens and walks. After the palace was
      completed, Princess Mary occupied apartments that were called "the queen's
      suite" forever after, though when she became Queen of England she ceased
      to live in Holland, and never even visited there. Under the windows of
      this suite was "the queen's garden," in the centre of which was a splendid
      large fountain. This garden opened through a hedge into another adorned
      with a number of fine statues. Then the princess had a poultry-yard, where
      she raised a fine breed of fowls that she was fond of tending, feeding,
      and watching,       an amusement that served to pass away many a tedious
      hour.
    
    
      A.D. 1680. Beyond the park was an immense
      aqueduct that supplied all the fountains and the fish-pond, as well as the
      means for irrigating; then there were further on long shady walks that
      terminated in a grove, where Mary often went to enjoy an hour's solitude,
      or perhaps to weep over her forlorn situation. She read, embroidered, and
      continued her drawing-lessons with Gibson, the dwarf master, who had
      followed her to Holland but had scarcely any society besides her
      maids-of-honor and her good nurse, Mrs. Langford, whose husband was one of
      her chaplains. All her English attendants were heartily detested by the
      prince, who managed to get rid of as many of them as possible and replace
      them with his Dutch subjects, who were, in most instances, by no means
      agreeable to Mary.
    
    
      A.D. 1684. Year by year William of Orange
      imposed so many acts of cruelty on his wife that at last she was  span
      class="pagenum">[356]almost
      afraid to express her opinion on any subject, and by the grossest
      misrepresentations he turned her heart from her own family, and in every
      possible way encouraged an intimacy between her and the Duke of Monmouth
      while he was an exile from England. This was before the Duke of York had
      ascended the throne. Charles II. had banished Monmouth from his realm; and
      William's object in being so friendly with him was, that in this enemy of
      the Duke of York he knew he should find a powerful ally who would further
      any plan of his, no matter how unscrupulous, by which he meant to prevent
      James from assuming the crown and usurp his place. The banished duke must
      have exerted a powerful influence over the mind of the princess in some
      mysterious way, otherwise it is hard to understand how she could consent
      to show marks of favor to a man who calumniated her own father. But she
      was sadly changed by this time, and all the affection she had once
      entertained for her parents had vanished. She went constantly to hear
      political sermons preached against her father, who was accused of dreadful
      crimes, that, whether true or false, should never have been pronounced
      within the hearing of his daughter. Her life that had been so monotonous
      became gay in the extreme after the appearance of Monmouth at the Hague;
      and she danced, flirted, and promenaded with him in a most undignified
      manner. Her father heard of this conduct, and remonstrated with the
      princess. She shed tears over his letter, but said, "that the prince was
      her master and would be obeyed." This was partly true, no doubt; but after
      being shut up as she had been for several years, she went to the other
      extreme, and enjoyed the gayety that her husband permitted her to indulge
      in while he was using her as a tool to further his intrigues with
      Monmouth. She is certainly to blame for her undignified behavior, but
      still more for the disrespect [357] a
      name="link357" id="link357">she showed her father, who had always been
      most kind and indulgent to her. In one of his fault-finding letters he
      wrote his daughter to warn her husband against Monmouth, who, in the event
      of King Charles's death and his own, would, he assured her, give them a
      struggle before they could get possession of the throne of Great Britain.
      Thus we see that James knew Monmouth was not to be trusted, though
      suspicion with regard to his son-in-law had not yet entered his head.
    
    
      It was not long after the marriage of Mary that King Charles began to
      think about a husband for his other niece, the Princess Anne. Several
      candidates for her hand were duly presented and considered, but at last
      the choice fell on Prince George of Denmark, brother to King Christian of
      that country. He was a valiant soldier, and had distinguished himself in
      several battles with the Swedes, during which he had rescued his brother,
      the king, from the enemy by his wonderful dash and presence of mind. He
      and the Princess Anne were married in 1683; and their nuptials, unlike
      those of Mary and the Prince of Orange, were conducted with great pomp,
      and succeeded by the usual celebrations. King Charles settled on the bride
      an income of twenty thousand pounds per annum, and presented her with a
      small palace adjoining Whitehall for her residence, for it was arranged
      that she was not to go to Denmark to live.
    
    
      A.D. 1685. We have spoken of the gay doings at
      the Holland court, but they were not to continue long; for suddenly
      everything was changed to mourning on the announcement of the death of
      King Charles II. of England. Princess Mary was very much grieved on
      account of this sad event, for all her remembrances of her uncle were of
      the most agreeable nature. The Duke of Monmouth and Prince William were
      closeted together for several hours after the [358] a
      name="link358" id="link358">news came, and that very night the duke
      started for England.
    
    
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Original
    
    
      But so secretly were his preparations and departure made that he was
      supposed to be shut up in his own room until late on the following clay.
      It was the prince who furnished him with money for the rash invasion of
      England which resulted in his execution. The details of his bold exploit
      are given in the last reign.
    
    
      After James was firmly seated on the throne, it would never do tor the
      Prince of Orange to appear in the light of [359] a
      name="link359" id="link359">an enemy, so he had to change his tactics
      forthwith. He pretended that the affectionate letters to his wife from her
      father were addressed to himself, and read them aloud to the ambassadors.
      To the king he wrote in the most humble terms, promising fidelity till
      death, and explaining that Monmouth had received only common hospitality
      at his hands, and been sent away-from the Hague as soon as possible.
    
    
      Certainly James II. regretted the necessity which compelled him to put
      Monmouth to death, but Princess Mary had formed such an attachment for him
      that she never forgave her father for causing that execution.
    
    
      A.D. 1686. During the following spring a plot
      against the life of Prince William was revealed to the princess, and she
      became so alarmed that she obtained for him a bodyguard, which had not
      previously been considered at all necessary.
    
    
      Then William Penn was sent by James II. to convince the prince that all
      laws tending to religious persecutions ought to be abolished; but his
      errand was a failure, because the prince declared "that he would lose all
      the revenues and prospects of the kingdom of Great Britain, to which his
      wife was heiress, before one should be abolished." And the princess
      indorsed this decision, adding: "That if ever she were Queen of England
      she should do more for the Protestants than even Queen Elizabeth had
      done."
    
    
      Penn spoke so plainly to the princess, and expressed his opinion so
      freely, that she disliked him forever after.
    
    
      A.D. 1688. The Prince and Princess of Orange had
      their spies in England, who kept them daily informed of every change in
      the political drama. Of these Lord and Lady Sunderland were the principal
      agents, and as this lord was prime minister he had special facilities for
      gaining knowledge. Another was the Princess Anne whose letters  span
      class="pagenum">[360]were
      remarkable for coarseness, vulgarity, and bad spelling. As she did not
      know of the bond existing between Lady Sunderland and her sister Mary, she
      sometimes filled her letters with abuse of that person, on whom she did
      not hesitate to bestow some very hard epithets. Her remarks must often
      have amused both William and Mary, who were better aware of what was going
      on in Great Britain than she was, although they were not on the spot. One
      of Anne's letters closes with this sentence: "One thing I forgot to tell
      you about Lord Sunderland, which is that it is thought if everything does
      not go here as he would have it, that he will pick a quarrel with the
      court and so retire, and possibly make his court to you."
    
    
      This shows that the princess little suspected Lord Sunderland of already
      being in the service of William. She had reasons of her own for trying to
      create ill-feeling between Mary and her father; and once when the princess
      had hinted at the possibility of her visiting England, Anne warned her in
      rather vague terms that her life might be in danger were she to present
      herself at her father's court.
    
    
      If Mary had considered how kind and indulgent that father had always been
      to his children, she would have insisted on an explanation; but the
      correspondence between these two sisters was interrupted for awhile by
      Anne's illness. The king watched by her bedside until she was past danger,
      and nursed her with the most tender care. What would have been his
      feelings, could he have known the treachery of the invalid at whose side
      he sat hour after hour, anxiously awaiting the result of her disease?
    
    
      Shortly after her recovery, Princess Anne asked permission of her father
      to spend a few weeks at the Hague. The Prince of Denmark, her husband, was
      going on a visit to his native land, and it was his wife's plan that she
      should be conducted by him to her sister's court, there to remain  span
      class="pagenum">[361]until his
      return. Her confidential friend, Lady Churchill, was to accompany her. But
      King James had begun to see something of the part his children were
      playing against him, and peremptorily refused to allow Anne to leave
      England. In a fit of temper at being thus opposed she retired to Bath,
      where she remained until after the birth of her brother, whose appearance
      in the world was most unwelcome to both her and Mary of Orange.
    
    
      Meanwhile affairs had taken such a turn that King James's downfall was
      rapidly approaching. His adherence to the Catholic cause deprived him of
      support from the Reformed church, and obliged some of the best and most
      loyal of his subjects to stand by and witness his ruin, though with
      intense pain, because they were unable to stir hand or foot in his behalf.
    
    
      Lord Clarendon, who had by this time returned to London from the Hague,
      was one of these. It will be remembered that he was King James's
      brother-in law, and a warm friendship had always existed between the two
      men. It was most painful to him to observe the indifference of Anne
      towards her father, particularly when reports reached England that the
      Prince of Orange was coming over with an army to invade the country.
      Clarendon questioned the princess to find out how much she knew of the
      matter, but could get very little satisfaction, for she evaded him as much
      as possible, and pretended to have no information but that which her
      husband had received from the king himself. After several vain attempts to
      induce his niece to speak to her father and endeavor to console him,       for
      he had sunken into a most painful state of melancholy,       Lord
      Clarendon begged her at least to urge the king to consult with some of his
      old friends, each and all of whom were warmly attached to him. But this
      unnatural daughter put him off, and preferred to increase her father's
      anguish. [362]One
      day in October there was a royal levee at Whitehall. The king was in a
      painfully depressed state of mind, and told Lord Clarendon that the Prince
      of Orange had embarked with his Dutch troops, and only awaited a favorable
      wind to sail, adding, "I have nothing by this day's post from my daughter
      Mary; and it is the first time I have missed hearing from her for a long
      while."
    
    
      The unfortunate father never heard from her again.
    
    
      Lord Clarendon made another attempt to induce Anne to save her father,
      which she might have done if she had chosen; but she did not, and treated
      every proposition with disgusting levity.
    
    
      Louis XIV. offered to intercept the Dutch fleet; but James declined his
      aid, because of the confidence he felt in his daughter Mary. Her last
      letter assured him that the prince's fleet was made ready to repel an
      attack of the French, which was hourly expected; and the fond, confiding
      father believed her.
    
    
      It was Dr. Burnet, a well-known author and minister, who undertook to
      explain to the Princess of Orange all the details of the political
      situation; and after the prince decided to get possession of the throne of
      Great Britain, he asked her what would be her husband's position, she
      being the heir and not he.
    
    
      She replied that she had not considered that point, but would be obliged
      to him if he would tell her. Burnet, who was evidently acting in the
      interest of the prince, replied, "That she must be contented as a wife to
      engage in her husband's interest and give him the real authority as soon
      as it came into her hands." Mary consented, and asked the doctor to bring
      the prince to her that she might assure him of her submission to his will.
      William was hunting that day; but on the morrow, after informing him of
      the conversation with the princess, Burnet conducted him to her presence.
      [363]Mary
      told him that she was surprised to hear from the doctor how, by the laws
      of England, a husband could be made subservient to his wife, providing the
      title of king came to him through her; and added a solemn promise that she
      should always be obedient to him, and that he should rule, not she.
      It seems surprising that so faithless a daughter should have been so
      dutiful a wife; but the prince had broken her spirit by his frequent acts
      of cruelty and neglect, and she was as submissive as a whipped cur.
    
    
      Instead of thanking his wife, William treated her decision as a matter of
      course, and merely answered with a grunt of satisfaction, giving Dr.
      Burnet great credit for the persuasive eloquence that had brought about so
      favorable a result.
    
    
      In October the Prince of Orange sailed with a fleet of fifty-two ships of
      war; and, after a very stormy voyage, landed at an English village on the
      anniversary of the Gunpowder Plot.
    
    
      Meeting with no opposition, he marched four miles into Devonshire,
      followed by his entire force. The prince knew what a risk he was taking,
      and waited with breathless anxiety to see how many of the west of England
      people would flock to his standard.
    
    
      He published a declaration that the Prince of Wales was not the real child
      of James II.; but that a strange baby had been adopted to impose on the
      British nation, who was to rule them as a Roman Catholic. This was done to
      prevent the country from educating the prince according to the doctrines
      of the Church of England, which would probably have established his
      succession. Of course a child upon whose birth any doubt was cast could
      never rule as a Catholic, nor be educated by the state for any purpose;
      therefore the daughters of James II. pretended to [364] a
      name="link364" id="link364">believe the falsehood, knowing that in the
      event of the prince's accession they would stand no chance of ever wearing
      the crown.
    
    
      News arrived in London that Lord Cornbury, eldest son of the Earl of
      Clarendon, had deserted the king's army with three regiments, and gone
      over to the enemy. Clarendon was overcome with grief and shame at such
      conduct on the part of one of his flesh and blood. When Princess Anne saw
      him she asked why he had not been to see her for several days. He replied,
      "that he was so much concerned for the villany his son had committed that
      he was ashamed of being seen anywhere."
    
    
      "Oh," replied the princess, "people are so apprehensive of popery that you
      will find many more of the army will do the same."
    
    
      And she was right; for desertions became of daily occurrence, and King
      James was surrounded by traitors on all sides. Anne knew of Lord
      Cornbury's intended desertion, and was anxiously awaiting news from her
      husband, who, with a display of affection and sincerity, had gone off with
      her father to assist in defending him against the Prince of Orange. Lord
      Churchill and Sir George Hewett were with the king also; and these two
      were concerned in a plot against the life of their sovereign, which the
      latter confessed on his deathbed some years later.
    
    
      Every time the king heard that one of his officers had gone over to the
      enemy, Prince George of Denmark would raise his eyes and hands with
      affected surprise, and exclaim, "Is it possible!" At last, after supping
      with the king and speaking in terms of abhorrence of all deserters, the
      prince, Churchill, and Hewett, taking advantage of an attack of illness
      that had suddenly seized their sovereign, went off in the night to the
      hostile camp. When informed of it, James exclaimed: "How? Has 'Is It
      Possible' gone [365] a name="link365"
      id="link365">off, too?" Yet this departure was a cruel blow to the
      father, who said: "After all, I only mind his conduct as connected with my
      child; otherwise the loss of a stout trooper would have been greater."
    
    
      In expectation of her husband's desertion, Anne had made arrangements for
      her own flight; and no sooner did the news reach her that he had gone than
      she followed. It was Sunday night, and the princess retired to her room at
      the usual hour. Mrs. Danvers, the lady-in-waiting, was not in the secret,
      and went to bed as usual in the ante-chamber. Ladies Fitzharding and
      Churchill had entered Princess Anne's room early in the evening, and
      hidden themselves by agreement in her dressing-room. At midnight,
      accompanied by these two women, the princess stole out of the palace, and
      met Lord Dorset in St. James's Park. A coach stood in waiting a little
      distance off; but the rain poured in torrents, and the mud was so deep
      that Anne lost one of her shoes in a puddle, from which there was neither
      time nor inclination to extricate it. This little accident was treated as
      a joke by the adventurers, who laughed heartily, while Lord Dorset
      gallantly stuck the princess's foot into one of the kid gauntlets he had
      pulled off; and assisted her to hop forward to the carriage. The party
      drove to the Bishop of London's house, where they were refreshed and the
      princess supplied with shoes, and started by daybreak for Lord Dorset's
      castle in Waltham Forest.
    
    
      After a few hours' rest they proceeded to Nottingham, where the Earl of
      Northampton, attired in military uniform, raised a purple standard in the
      name of the laws and liberties of England, and invited the people to
      gather around the Protestant heiress to the throne. Afterwards Anne went
      on to Warwick, where there was a project on foot for the extermination of
      all the papists in England. Although the princess knew that her father's
      head would be the first to [366] a
      name="link366" id="link366">fall should such a plan be carried into
      effect, she was so unnatural as to favor it.
    
    
      A tremendous uproar was raised when Anne's women-in-waiting entered her
      room the morning after her flight and found her bed undisturbed and the
      princess herself missing. Before many minutes the whole court was aroused
      with the lamentations of the people, who declared that the princess had
      been murdered by the queen's priests. The storm rose to such a height that
      a mob collected in the street and swore that the palace should be pulled
      down, and Mary Beatrice pulled to pieces if Anne were not forthcoming. No
      doubt the threat would have been put into execution had it not been for
      the discovery of a letter which the missing princess had left lying on her
      toilet-table, stating that she had gone off to avoid the king's
      displeasure on account of her husband's desertion; and that she should
      remain away until a reconciliation had been effected. "Never was any one,"
      she wrote, "in such an unhappy condition, so divided between duty to a
      father and a husband; and therefore I know not what I must do but to
      follow one to preserve the other." This would be all very well if she had
      been dutiful to her father; but as she had only one week before informed
      Orange by letter that her husband would soon be with him, ready to serve
      his cause to the utmost, we can only feel intense disgust at such
      deception [367]
    
    
      
    
    
    
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XI.
    
    
      James II. arrived
      in London just after the excitement caused by Anne's escape had subsided.
      He had been obliged to leave his army on account of illness, and when he
      heard of his daughter's conduct, he struck his breast and exclaimed: "God
      help me! my own children have forsaken me in my distress." From that
      moment he lost heart and ceased to struggle to retain his crown; but he
      never censured Anne as he might have done, nor was he aware of the extent
      of her treachery.
    
    
      Meanwhile, the Prince of Orange induced many of the most loyal subjects of
      the crown to join him by circulating the report that he had come to
      England for the sole purpose of establishing peace between James II. and
      his people. So he advanced as far as Henley, and while resting there
      heard, to his unspeakable joy, that the king had disbanded his army, and
      followed his wife, who, with the Prince of Wales, had escaped to France.
      They could not more completely have played into his hand.
    
    
      Prince George of Denmark waited for his wife at Oxford, which place she
      entered with military state, escorted by several thousand mounted
      gentlemen, who, with their tenants, had joined her followers as she passed
      through the various counties. Bishop Compton, Anne's early tutor, rode
      before her in military dress, and carried a purple flag in token of his
      adherence to her cause. [368] a name="link368"
      id="link368">James had been captured and taken back to Whitehall, so
      William of Orange stopped at Windsor and sent his Dutch guard forward to
      expel his uncle; for neither he nor his sister-in-law dared to face the
      father whom they had so basely injured. The next day the prince entered
      London quietly, went straight to St. James's Palace, and retired to his
      bedchamber. In the evening bells rang, guns fired, and there was general
      rejoicing among the Orange party. A few days later the Prince and Princess
      of Denmark returned, and took up their abode at the palace they had lived
      in ever since their marriage, called the Cockpit, because the site of it
      had once been used for that barbarous amusement.
    
    
      A.D. 1689. Anne felt no regret at the fate that
      had overtaken her unfortunate father, but triumphantly appeared in public
      with Lady Churchill, both decked in orange ribbons, an emblem of the cause
      they had espoused. Her uncle, Lord Clarendon, took her severely to task
      for not showing some concern on account of her father's downfall, but she
      proved very plainly that she felt none; but it was not many weeks before
      she regretted having taken sides with William. This was not because of any
      qualms of conscience, or awakening of affection for her parent,       no,
      indeed! It was only that her interests were at stake, and her rights in
      danger of being forfeited. A convention had been called to arrange how the
      kingdom was to be governed, and as leader of a well-disciplined army of
      fourteen thousand foreign soldiers, quartered in and about London, the
      Prince of Orange was likely to have the matter settled just as he chose.
      The convention were perplexed, however; for though they decided to exclude
      the Prince of Wales and settle the succession on Mary of Orange, they were
      by no means willing, in the event of her death, to have the kingdom
      governed by a foreigner, particularly as his religion
    
    
      [369]
    
    
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Original
    
    
      [371]was
      as far removed from that of the Church of England as James's was.
    
    
      While they were considering this matter William was so taciturn and glum
      that the English lords could not find out what he wanted, so they applied
      to some of his Dutch attendants to know what ailed their master, and were
      informed that if Princess Mary was to occupy the throne and take
      precedence of her husband he would go back to Holland; for he was not
      willing to be tied by apron strings, or to play the part of
      gentleman-usher to his own wife. The English nobles were more perplexed
      than ever; but at this juncture Dr. Burnet came to their relief, and said,
      that as Mary's spiritual adviser he was well aware of how she would decide
      if the matter were left to her, because she had told him that she
      preferred yielding precedence to her husband in every affair of life. Then
      word was sent to the Princess Mary, "that if she considered it proper to
      insist on her lineal rights the convention would persist in declaring her
      sole sovereign." Her answer was: "That she was the prince's wife, and
      never meant to be other than in subjection to him, and that she did not
      thank any one for setting up for her an interest divided from that of her
      husband." That settled the matter; for the national convention of lords
      and commons decided that the Prince of Orange was to be offered the crown,
      and that his wife was to have joint sovereignty. Their children, if they
      had any, were to succeed them, but if not the Princess Anne was next in
      the line.
    
    
      Being satisfied at last, William permitted his wife to join him in
      England. The Princess of Orange had made herself beloved in Holland, and
      tears filled her eyes when she heard one of the common people say, as she
      was embarking, "that he hoped the English might love her as well as those
      had done whom she was leaving." [372] a
      name="link372" id="link372">A swift, pleasant voyage soon brought
      Princess Mary to Gravesend, where she was met by her sister and Prince
      George of Denmark. The two sisters were so elated at their success that
      they embraced again and again, and went into perfect transports of joy.
      Amidst a chorus of shouts and welcomes they entered their exiled father's
      barge, and soon landed at Whitehall, where William met them. All those who
      witnessed Mary's conduct that day, even her best friends, were shocked.
      Gravity would have been becoming considering that she was taking
      possession of the home from which reverse of fortune had driven her father
      only a few days before; but she was excessively gay, and went all over the
      palace, looking into the cupboards, examining the furniture, and making
      remarks upon what had been removed, and what left for her use with
      revolting heartlessness. She took possession of the apartments Mary
      Beatrice had used, slept in her bed, made use of her toilet articles, and
      within a night or two sat down to a game of basset in the very spot her
      predecessor had occupied.
    
    
      Next day the ceremony of recognition of William and Mary as sovereigns of
      England took place. They proceeded in state robes to the banqueting hall
      of the palace, and placed themselves in chairs of state under the royal
      canopy, their attendants taking their respective places near by. Then Lord
      Halifax made a short speech, desiring their majesties to accept the crown.
      The prince answered, and the princess curtsied, but showed no reluctance
      at assuming her father's crown. After affixing their names to the Bill of
      Rights, which promised enjoyment of religious liberty to every Protestant
      Englishman, William III. and Mary II. were proclaimed king and queen.
    
    
      Lord Clarendon was so disgusted with the turn of affairs that he retired
      to his country seat, but he sent a letter to his niece, which must have
      contained some unflattering [373] a
      name="link373" id="link373">remarks, for his wife, to whom he
      intrusted it, was afraid to deliver it. His brother Laurence had been
      civilly received by William; but Mary had refused to see him or his
      children, little girls of seven and eight years, respectively.
    
    
      After a few weeks of London life King William hurried his wife away with
      him to Hampton Court, and only went to town on business. He pleaded
      ill-health as an excuse; but his conduct gave great dissatisfaction,
      because diversions that had attended previous courts disappeared, and the
      king was so surly that people feared to approach him. The queen was
      vivacious and affable, but as she took little or no interest in state
      affairs, nothing was to be gained by special attention to her, so few
      gathered about her.
    
    
      There were many loyal citizens who positively refused to take an oath of
      allegiance to the new sovereigns. Among these were Lord Clarendon, four of
      the bishops who had been sent to the Tower by James II., and several
      hundred members of the English clergy, besides Archbishop San-croft, who
      it was fondly hoped would perform the coronation ceremony. That important
      event next occupied the attention of everybody at court. A new globe,
      sceptre, and sword of state were made for Mary II., but she was to wear
      the beautiful crown that her father had provided for his queen.
    
    
      The eleventh of April was the day appointed; it was fraught with anxiety
      and care, for just as the king and queen were ready to set out for
      Westminster Hall news was brought to them of the successful landing of
      James II. in Ireland. Added to that, a letter was handed to Queen Mary by
      her lord chamberlain, which proved to be from her father,       the first
      he had written her since her arrival in England. He wrote: "That hitherto
      he had made all fatherly excuses for what had been done, and had
      attributed her part in the revolution to obedience to her husband;  span
      class="pagenum">[374]but the act
      of being crowned was in her own power, and if she were crowned while he
      and the Prince of Wales were living, the curses of an outraged father
      would light upon her as well as of that God who has commanded duty to
      parents."
    
    
      After reading this awful letter, William declared that he "had done
      nothing but by his wife's advice and approbation;" and she retorted, "That
      if her father regained his authority her husband might thank himself for
      letting him go as he did." When these words were reported to King James he
      felt convinced that his daughter Mary had desired some cruel act to be
      committed towards him.
    
    
      Whether she had or no, she must have performed her part in the coronation
      ceremony with a heavy heart, for with a father's curse resting upon her
      how could it have been otherwise!
    
    
      As the clock struck twelve the king descended the stairs of Whitehall,
      entered the royal barge, and was rowed to Westminster Palace, where, in a
      private chamber, he dressed himself in the parliamentary robes. An hour
      later the queen was carried in her sedan chair also to Westminster. She
      wore state robes of velvet, bordered with ermine; on her head was a diadem
      of gold, richly studded with precious stones. The procession was much
      smaller than that attending any previous coronation had been, because so
      many of the lords and ladies refused to be present.
    
    
      As soon as the usual ceremonies were completed, Dr. Burnet, who had been
      created Bishop of Salisbury, preached the sermon; then the Bishop of
      London administered the oath, and anointed both sovereigns. The Archbishop
      of Canterbury had refused to crown either William or Mary, so that office
      also was performed by the Bishop of London.
    
    
      The banquet was given at Westminster Hall; but every- [375] a
      name="link375" id="link375">thing had gone so slowly that it was
      almost dark before the challenger entered. This was Dymoke, son of the
      champion of James II. As he flung his gauntlet upon the ground an old
      woman hobbled out from among the crowd that stood to witness the feast,
      and replaced it with a lady's glove, in which was an answer to the
      challenge, the time and place being appointed in Hyde Park. From two till
      four the next day a large man was seen to pace up and down the appointed
      spot; but Dymoke did not appear, and the champion of James II., whoever he
      was, went on his way unharmed.
    
    
      King William attended parliament both before and after his coronation; but
      never did Queen Mary accompany him or have any voice in the government
      whatever.
    
    
      After James II.'s defeat in Ireland, the Dutch ambassador arrived in
      England to congratulate the king and queen on their accession, when
      rewards and honors were distributed very freely, especially on those who
      held positions in the household of either Mary or Anne. Lord Churchill
      received the title of Earl of Marlborough, and henceforth Anne's
      confidential friend will be known by the name of Lady Marlborough.
    
    
      Now Princess Anne's displeasure was aroused because she failed to see any
      gain that had accrued to her from the revolution. While others had
      attained wealth and station, she had heard a rumor that King William had
      expressed his astonishment at her having a revenue of thirty thousand
      pounds per annum, and wondered how she could possibly spend it. This
      alarmed her, particularly as she had been promised an additional sum by
      her brother-in-law, which she soon saw there was no probability of
      getting. King William carried economy to such an excess that he objected
      to Anne's having separate meals for her branch of the family; but his
      manners at table were so disagreeable [376] a
      name="link376" id="link376">that no lady cared to be present when he
      ate. He was unpolished in every action, selfish, vulgar, and ill-natured
      in the extreme. One day a dish of early green peas was placed in front of
      Anne; they were the first of the season, and looked particularly inviting;
      but a look was all she got of them, for the king took possession of the
      dish and devoured the entire contents.
    
    
      William was inhospitable, too, excepting to his own countrymen. When he
      dined at St. James's Palace, Marshal Schomberg, the general of the foreign
      troops, sat at his right hand, and some Dutch officers occupied other
      places at the table; but if any English nobleman came in William neither
      spoke to them nor invited them to sit down and eat, which common courtesy
      demanded. This was very galling, for it humbled the English and placed the
      Dutch in the position of their conquerors.
    
    
      The Earl of Marlborough had an aid-de-camp named Dillon, who was intimate
      with Arnold von Keppel, a favorite page of King William. These boys were
      usually present at the royal dinners. One day Dillon said: "I have never
      heard your master utter a word to anybody; does he ever speak?"
    
    
      "Oh, yes," replied von Keppel, "he talks fast enough at night over his
      bottle of Holland gin, when he has only his Dutch friends about him."
    
    
      When Lady Marlborough questioned the young Dillon as to what he saw and
      heard at the king's table, he replied "That no man was ever treated with
      such neglect and contempt as Lord Marlborough was.
    
    
      "It is just what he deserves," replied the gracious dame; "he should have
      considered how much better he was off some months ago." This shows that
      Anne's favorite was not very friendly to King William at that time.
    
    
      Dillon told her besides that he heard the king say "that Lord Marlborough
      had the best talents for war of any one [377] a
      name="link377" id="link377">in England; but he was a vile man, and
      though he had himself profited by his treason he abhorred the traitor."
    
    
      This may have been merely a bit of gossip; but William placed the earl in
      command of English troops, which he sent to Holland to fill the place of
      the Dutch forces he thought fit to retain near him in case of need.
    
    
      While Marlborough was absent his wife busied herself with Princess Anne to
      get possession of the best suite of apartments at Whitehall. The queen
      wanted them, and a regular dispute arose between the two sisters, which
      might have gone on indefinitely had not William settled the matter in
      favor of Anne, to whom he felt he must yield something for peace sake. She
      retained her palace of the Cockpit also, and demanded the one at Richmond;
      but that passed into the possession of Madame Puissars, one of the
      daughters of Lady Villiers, and she would not relinquish it.
    
    
      From that hour the royal sisters were at enmity with each other, though
      for a time they kept up an appearance of cordiality
    
    
      On the very evening that a report was brought to William and Mary of the
      death of James II. in Ireland they attended the theatre; but it happened
      the play contained so many allusions to various actions of their majesties
      relating to their accession and the treachery that preceded it, that they
      were both rendered excessively uncomfortable, particularly as each time
      the whole audience turned and looked straight at them. After that the
      master of the court amusements was ordered to be very careful what plays
      were produced.
    
    
      Several of Shakespeare's were prohibited, but particularly King Lear,
      which is not surprising. Nevertheless, the whole country blamed Queen Mary
      for her indifference to her father's fate, and verses containing the most
      scathing [378]satire
      on her conduct were constantly distributed at the various coffee-houses.
    
    
      Princess Anne had a son born during the summer, which was a very joyful
      event for all the royal family represented at Hampton Court. They were
      pleased, because as the child would be educated in the Reformed faith,
      there would be little probability of his being superseded by the Roman
      Catholic line of Stuart.
    
    
      The king and queen stood sponsors for the infant, who was baptized
      William, and the same day proclaimed Duke of Gloucester. Mary fondled her
      little nephew a great deal, and paid more attention to her sister than she
      had done before. But she became dreadfully angry when she found out that
      through the instrumentality of Lady Marlborough Anne had applied to the
      House of Commons for an income to be settled on herself. It was perfectly
      natural that the princess should make this demand, and it was granted; but
      Mary accused her of deceit and ingratitude for acting in such an underhand
      manner, and asked her in an angry tone: "What was the meaning of the
      proceedings in the House of Commons?"
    
    
      Anne replied: "That she heard her friends there wished she should have a
      settled income."
    
    
      "Friends?" asked the queen, haughtily, "Pray what friends have you but the
      king and me?"
    
    
      Perhaps Queen Mary might not have objected to a provision being made for
      her sister, had it not been the decision of parliament that the fifty
      thousand pounds they granted Anne should be deducted from King William's
      income. But she did not get it, for her brother-in-law managed to postpone
      the payment of the money throughout the summer, and Anne became deeply
      involved in debt. So much ill-feeling had grown up between her and her
      sister in consequence of this pecuniary difficulty that she resolved  span
      class="pagenum">[379]to remove
      from Hampton Court. An excellent excuse offered itself in the illness of
      her baby, for he did not thrive for the first two or three months of his
      existence, and it was thought change of air would benefit him. Lord Craven
      offered his fine house at Kensington for the prince's nursery; and just
      before his removal a young Quakeress, named Mrs. Pack, was engaged to
      nurse him. Anne was soon gratified by seeing a decided improvement in her
      child, who was taken out every day to get the air in a little carriage
      drawn by a pair of ponies no larger than goodsized dogs. These animals
      were led by Dick Drury, the Prince of Denmark's coachman.
    
    
      Meanwhile the Earl of Marlborough returned from Holland, when he and his
      wife put their heads together and took such decided steps in favor of
      Anne's income that before the end of the year the Commons intimated to the
      king the propriety of allowing her fifty thousand pounds.
    
    
      The Protestant branch of the royal family firmly held the reins of
      government in England at last but they were no happier than the exiled
      Catholic portion, and dissatisfaction had grown steadily among the masses.
    
    
      James II. had left his country free from debt. One year after his
      deposition the revenue was minus three millions of pounds. The king had
      not spent it all; but dishonesty was the order of the day, and whoever
      could obtain a government contract, whether for raising a regiment,
      provisioning, or clothing the army in Ireland, or providing ammunition for
      the navy, stole more than half the sum they received. They took advantage
      of the unsettled state of public affairs to enrich themselves.
    
    
      Thus the English navy       the pride of the sailor-king, James       sustained
      a shameful defeat, and the seamen were perfectly well aware that it was
      not lack of skill and bravery on their part that caused it. The soldiers
      in Ire land [380] a name="link380"
      id="link380">were supplied with bad food and damaged clothing, and
      many of them died of disease.
    
    
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Original
    
    
      James had never permitted the merchant ships to be taxed for the
      protection they received from war-vessels; but now the convoy money
      reached such an enormous sum that the merchants sent an appeal to
      parliament to relieve them of such a dreadful tax. One of the worst
      offenders in exacting this extortion was Captain Churchill, brother to the
      Earl of Marlborough, and so serious was the charge brought against him
      that he [381]was
      expelled from the House of Commons, of which he was a member, and deprived
      of his vessel.
    
    
      A.D. 1690. The Duke of Schomberg made serious
      complaints by letter to the king, to whom he wrote with regard to Mr.
      Harbord's regiment: "I do assure your majesty that the existence of this
      fine regiment is limited to its standard, which leans in a corner of his
      dressing-room, and that is all that he can show of it. Never, in all my
      life, did I see a nation so willing to steal."
    
    
      William knew that his throne was tottering beneath so much corruption, and
      he deserved the misery such knowledge occasioned him. One day he was
      discussing his troubles with his favorite, Bentinck, whom he had created
      Earl of Portland, and expressed his surprise at the financial condition of
      the country..
    
    
      Portland asked his royal friend, "Whether he believed that there was one
      honest man in the whole of Great Britain?"
    
    
      "Yes, there are many," replied William, with a deep-drawn sigh, "there are
      many men of high honor in this country as well as in others,       perhaps
      more; but, my Lord Portland, they are not my friends."
    
    
      The following spring King William meant to join his troops in Ireland, and
      purchased Lord Nottingham's estate at Kensington, in order that a palace
      might be completed thereon by the time he should return. The king was a
      martyr to asthma, and could scarcely breathe in the smoky atmosphere of
      London; therefore, he determined to have a home, not too far off, in a
      healthful district.
    
    
      Queen Mary superintended the building of this palace, and displayed
      extraordinary taste in the planning of the grounds and the laying out of
      the gardens. This occupied a great deal of her time during the king's
      absence, but as he left the government in her hands she had other matters
      [382]to
      attend to besides. Nine councillors were appointed to advise and assist
      the queen; but Prince George was not of their number, because he had hired
      some Danish troops to fight against his father-in-law, and accompanied the
      king to Ireland.
    
    
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Original
    
    
      Queen Mary acted with a great deal of decision, and wrote letters to her
      husband every day to keep him informed of everything that transpired. When
      a French fleet appeared in the channel she had a large number of noblemen
      who were not friendly to her cause arrested. Among these were her two
      uncles, who had viewed her conduct with shame and disgust. Her next step
      was to banish all Catholics from London and its vicinity. Her position was
      really dreadful, for she was surrounded by secret enemies and people who
      consulted their own interest above everything else. The defeat of the navy
      by the French at [383] a name="link383"
      id="link383">Beachy Head was a great misfortune that would not have
      befallen the English if their ships had been kept in proper condition; but
      there was no one to look out for them as King James had done. Queen Mary
      had no confidence in several candidates who offered themselves for the
      command, and others whom she desired to take it had no confidence in
      themselves for naval service. This defeat was soon forgotten, however,
      when news arrived of the victory of William's army at the Boyne. Without
      any thought for the fate of her father, Mary gave herself up to rejoicing
      over the success of her husband,       the one subject that filled her
      mind. She at once began to urge his return, but William was too good a
      general not to know that the contest was not yet decided. Much misery had
      been caused in Ireland by the presence of his enormous army, and that
      wretched country was not yet to cease groaning under his despotism. When
      compelled to raise the siege of Waterford, William was asked how the sick
      and wounded prisoners were to be disposed of. "Burn them!" was his wicked
      command; and this was only one of the many cruel acts really perpetrated
      by his troops.
    
    
      William was anxious to return to England; but, as the victorious French
      fleet occupied both the English channel and that of St. George, it was no
      safe matter for him to venture past their ships.
    
    
      Meanwhile, the queen continued her daily letters, and made most humble
      apologies to her despotic lord, because his Kensington Palace was not
      quite ready for his reception, and still smelt of the fresh paint. She
      took all the blame on herself, and expressed her willingness to put
      herself to any inconvenience, no matter how great, if only she might
      advance his comfort and hasten his return. This wifely devotion would be
      all right if William had been a good husband, but he was not, and showed
      himself incapable of appreciating the sacrifices offered for his sake.
      [384]Queen
      Mary was sorely perplexed about the command of the navy. Her father had
      left it ruler of the seas, but two disastrous defeats that had overtaken
      it since her accession had so demoralized the sailors and destroyed the
      vessels that none of the old sea-captains could be induced to contend
      against the well-appointed fleet of Louis XIV. She proposed Churchill in
      one of her letters, but she ought to have recoiled from placing the man
      who had extorted convoy money from the merchant ships in such an important
      position of trust. At last the French fleet left the Irish coast, and gave
      the king a chance to slip over to England, which he gladly began to
      prepare for; but first he attempted to besiege Limerick. Twelve hundred of
      his soldiers were killed, but the governor made such a desperate
      resistance that William raised the siege, and embarked for England with
      Prince George of Denmark.
    
    
      His return had been delayed so much longer than he intended that
      Kensington Palace was ready for his reception. After spending a couple of
      days at Hampton Court, he went with the queen to their new home, where
      they remained throughout the autumn.
    
    
      Mary possessed unusual ability for governing, as she proved later, when
      her husband was carrying on his war in Flanders. As soon as he finished
      his Irish campaign, his whole time and attention were directed towards
      preparations for his war, which was a great drain on the wealth of Great
      Britain, and consequently a source of dissatisfaction to the people.
    
    
      Lord Marlborough made his first military success in Ireland just after
      William had returned from that country, and was warmly thanked for it,
      when he presented himself at Kensington, by the king and queen, though
      they had not forgiven him for the interest he took in procuring Princess
      Anne's income for her.
    
    
      [A.D. 1691.] [385] a name="link385"
      id="link385">At the beginning of the following year the king embarked
      for the Hague, leaving the same nine lords to advise and assist the queen
      as before. A plot for the restoration of James II. had been discovered;
      but that did not detain William after his arrangements were perfected for
      the war he was anxious to continue.
    
    
      The very day after his departure the trial of Lord Preston and Mr. Ashton
      began. Both were implicated in this plot, and both had occupied important
      positions in the household of King James. Ashton was executed, but
      Preston's life was spared in this way: Lady Catherine Graham, a little
      girl nine years of age, was his daughter, and loved him very dearly.
      During his trial she remained at Windsor Castle, where she had lived up to
      that period with her parents. The day after Lord Preston was condemned the
      queen found the child in St. George's gallery gazing earnestly up at a
      picture of James II. Her mournful expression attracted the attention of
      Mary, who asked little Catherine, "What she saw in that picture that made
      her look at it so steadily?"
    
    
      "I was thinking," replied the child, "how hard it is that my father must
      die for loving yours."
    
    
      The queen's conscience was pricked by this answer, and she signed Lord
      Preston's pardon.
    
    
      But she may have had another reason for this good deed, for Preston could
      tell all the particulars of the plot, and did so. His evidence caused the
      punishment of many of the nobility and clergy, and led to the imprisonment
      of the queen's uncle, Lord Clarendon, who remained shut up in the Tower as
      long as Mary's regency lasted. Many people were put to the torture who
      either had conspired against their majesties or were suspected of doing
      so; and Sancroft, the Archbishop of Canterbury, besides other Church of
      England clergymen, were deprived of their positions, [386] a
      name="link386" id="link386">because they refused to take the oath of
      allegiance to William and Mary.
    
    
      During these dreadful proceedings King William's life had been in danger
      on the coast of Holland, where a dense fog prevented his making land as
      soon as he expected. Hearing from some fisherman that he was not more than
      a mile and a half from shore, the king resolved to be rowed in his barge.
      The Duke of Ormond and some other noblemen accompanied him. In a few
      moments the boat was lost in the fog, and could neither approach the shore
      nor return to the fleet. Night came on, and the waves dashed over the
      king, as he lay in the bottom of the boat covered up with his cloak. Some
      one expressed alarm at the situation when William asked sternly, "What,
      are you afraid to die with me?" At daybreak the fog had risen, and the
      party in the royal barge landed.
    
    
      The king met with a grand reception at the Hague, for this was his first
      appearance there since he had mounted the British throne, and the Dutch
      considered that he had made the conquest of Great Britain. They hailed him
      "The Conqueror," which was not a pleasant sound to the Englishmen who had
      accompanied him.
    
    
      After a stay of three months William returned to Eng-land for a supply of
      money and troops, and arrived just in time to see the Palace of Whitehall
      burned to the ground. Queen Mary barely escaped with her life, for she was
      a sound sleeper, and had not been aroused until the fire was well under
      way in the part of the palace she occupied.
    
    
      The enmity between Mary and Anne was kept alive by several disagreeable
      circumstances, and encouraged by the partisans of each.
    
    
      We have seen what influence Lord Marlborough and his wife exerted over the
      Princess Anne. Their ambition prompted them to prefer a request through
      her that the [387] a name="link387"
      id="link387">Order of the Garter might be bestowed on the earl as a
      reward for his military merit. This was refused by Queen Mary, and
      Marlborough was so enraged that he at once set to work to conspire for the
      downfall of herself and the king. As he was one of the council of nine
      appointed to assist the queen in governing, her position became dangerous,
      particularly as Marlborough wrote James II., "That he regretted his crimes
      against him, and would bring the Princess Anne back to her duty at the
      least word of encouragement."
    
    
      James's only reply was, "That his good intentions must be proved by deeds
      rather than words."
    
    
      The result was a very dutiful letter written by Anne to her father; but as
      Lady Fitzharding acted as a spy for the king, both he and Queen Mary knew
      all about the letter long before it reached its destination. It was
      written near the end of the year, and shortly after William's return from
      Flanders, where some bloody battles had been fought, and a great number of
      lives had been lost among the English troops; so his majesty's temper was
      not sweetened in the least.
    
    
      When it was Marlborough's turn to act as gentleman of the bed-chamber he
      began his duties, but was soon dismissed, and afterwards received a
      message, "that the king and queen desired Lord Marlborough to absent
      himself from their presence for the future."
    
    
      This made Princess Anne very angry; but her anger was changed to alarm,
      when she was informed by an anonymous letter that the next step of the
      government would be to imprison Lord Marlborough, and added a warning as
      to the treachery of Lady Fitzharding. The king and queen brought no
      charge; because, if they had dared openly to accuse Marlborough of trying
      to effect a reconciliation between Anne and her father, many of their
      subjects would have followed his example.
    
    
      [A.D. 1692.] [388] a name="link388"
      id="link388">Shortly after her husband's dismissal, Lady Marlborough
      attended Princess Anne to a court reception. The next day Queen Mary wrote
      her sister that not only must the lady not appear again at court, but she
      must be at once dismissed from her service, because her presence at the
      Cockpit gave Lord Marlborough an excuse for appearing where he was
      forbidden to come.
    
    
      Anne wrote her sister a letter full of remonstrance, praising the virtues
      of Lady Marlborough, and refusing to part with her. The only reply she got
      was an official message from Queen Mary, warning Lord and Lady Marlborough
      to remain no longer at the palace.
    
    
      But Anne was determined not to part with her favorite, so politely
      informed the queen rather than do so she herself would depart. She then
      applied to the Duchess of Somerset for the loan of her Sion house for the
      summer, and received the reply, "that Sion house was entirely at her
      service."
    
    
      King William had requested the Duke of Somerset not to grant the demand of
      Princess Anne; and finding that he had not been obeyed, he determined on a
      petty revenge, rather unusual with him. He ordered that Anne should be
      deprived of the guards that had attended her ever since her father had
      allowed her to set up an establishment of her own. This was a serious
      matter, because highwaymen infested all the roads in the vicinity of
      London, and the princess was really stopped once when driving out, and
      robbed of all the jewels and money she had with her. The king and queen
      were very much censured for allowing their sister to go about in such an
      unprotected state. This was done by means of placards and circulars; for
      there were no daily papers in those days for the expression of public
      opinion, and, as a rule, they were made out in rhyme. Sometimes they were
      set to music and sung about the streets or in the various coffee-houses.
      [389]William
      returned to his Flemish campaign again in March, and left his wife to
      govern alone for the third time. Previous to his departure he had signed
      the warrant which authorized the massacre of Glencove. A hundred men,
      women, and children were slaughtered in cold blood in this Highland glen;
      but William was probably ignorant of the details of this atrocious crime,
      which cast a dark shadow over his glory. He may have thought that the
      intention of his agents in Scotland was merely to extirpate a band of
      thieves, but such was not the case; theirs was an act of outrageous
      cruelty prompted by revenge, and William was too much interested in his
      campaign to pay much attention to it.
    
    
      One of Mary's first public acts after her husband's departure was to
      review a band of ten thousand men in Hyde Park, who were destined to
      defend the capital in case of an invasion from France. Next she sent
      Russell, an arrogant, dishonest politician, in charge of the English navy,
      to combine with the Dutch fleet in opposition to the French. It was
      necessity that compelled the queen to choose Russell for her admiral: she
      would have preferred the more able Marlborough; but as he was now an open
      enemy, ready at a moment's notice to fly to the side of King James, that
      could not be.
    
    
      Princess Anne was seriously ill a short time after, and the queen went to
      see her as soon as she heard of it; but instead of talking kindly to her
      sister, and expressing sympathy, she merely sat by her bedside for a few
      moments, and then said: "I have made the first step towards reconciliation
      by coming to you, and I now hope that you will make the next by dismissing
      Lady Marlborough." The remark was certainly ill-timed, and no doubt the
      queen regretted it later; but she never told her sister so, and they
      remained enemies to the end. Anne's reply, which [390] a
      name="link390" id="link390">was made in a weak, trembling voice on
      account of her illness, was: "I have never in my life disobeyed your
      majesty but in this one particular, and I hope at some time or other it
      will appear as unreasonable to your majesty as it does now to me." Queen
      Mary immediately arose and took her departure, but repeated to Prince
      George, as he was leading her to her carriage, precisely what she had said
      to his wife. An attack of fever followed her sister's visit, and for
      several days Anne's life was despaired of, but she recovered at last. No
      sooner was her convalescence established, however, than she was thrown
      into a dreadful state of distress, because the queen had ordered
      Marlborough to be arrested and hurried off to the Tower. The charge
      brought against him was that he was in correspondence with the court at
      St. Germain; and while the French invasion threatened Mary thought best to
      secure herself against his treachery by putting him safely out of the way.
    
    
      Princess Anne considered herself a very ill-used sister, and never lost an
      opportunity of appearing in the attitude of injured innocence, so she
      wrote to Stillingfleet, Bishop of Worcester, and requested him to come to
      her. He obeyed, and she showed him a letter she had written her sister,
      the queen, in which she requested permission to wait upon her majesty, but
      dared not do so without it, because of the displeasure she had incurred.
      At the conclusion of the letter the princess added, that she would not
      think of returning to the Cockpit to live unless it was agreeable to her
      majesty. Anne's reason for sending this submissive document through the
      Bishop of Worcester, was that she wanted everybody to know she had tried
      to act in a friendly manner towards her sister.
    
    
      After reading the letter the bishop consented to be the bearer of it, and
      the reply he brought back was decided and formal.

      Original
    
    
      [393]The
      queen stated that she had done all towards a reconciliation that she meant
      to do, and that if Princess Anne would not consent to the dismissal of
      Lady Marlborough she need not trouble herself to come to court; for she
      would not be received.
    
    
      Knowing that in the circumstances a residence at the Cockpit would be
      anything but agreeable, Anne retained it only for those of her attendants
      who were not obnoxious to the government, and leased Berkeley House for
      herself. Then she wrote to Lady Marlborough, who was with her husband, and
      related all that had happened, closing her letter with assurances of
      undying devotion and a desire soon to be reunited.
    
    
      The battle of La Hogue was so decided a success for the English navy that
      it restored some of its lost credit. Queen Mary was well pleased with the
      valor of her sailors, and sent thirty thousand pounds in gold to be
      distributed among them, and a gold medal to each of the officers. But she
      deserves credit for a still worthier deed; she ordered the unfinished
      palace of Greenwich to be fitted up for the wounded seamen, and every
      possible care to be taken of them.
    
    
      After the victory of La Hogue the queen made an effort to keep alive the
      popular enthusiasm by receiving addresses of congratulation, dressed in
      her regal robes, and by reviewing the militia and artillery companies in
      person. But she was at the same time guilty of several acts of tyranny in
      causing the death of those whom the jury had failed to convict.
    
    
      She kept Lord Marlborough shut up in the Tower as long as possible, and
      only released him at last on bail. Meanwhile, Princess Anne was deprived
      of the society of her favorites, but she frequently wrote to Lady
      Marlborough, and referred to the king as "Caliban," or "that Dutch  span
      class="pagenum">[394]monster";
      she sometimes mentioned her little son, the Duke of Gloucester, and said
      that she patiently awaited the bright day when he should arrive at man's
      estate, so that England might flourish again.
    
    
      In order to rid the metropolis of burglars, and the neighboring roads of
      highwaymen, Queen Mary issued a proclamation offering forty pounds a head
      for such offenders. This led to the execution of an enormous number of
      people without remedying the evil, and the reward thus obtained was called
      "blood-money." Queen Mary's order was meant to benefit her subjects, but
      it proved a serious evil, for the prisons were soon filled to overflowing,
      and the jailers and thief-catchers played into each other's hands, and
      often punished innocent people for the sake of the "blood-money." They
      managed in this way: One of the villains would pretend to be a
      professional robber, and entice a couple of youths or dishonestly inclined
      men to join him in waylaying and robbing a certain party. That party would
      of course be a confederate, who would follow up the dupes, trace the
      stolen property with the assistance of the originator of the crime, and by
      that means cause two arrests and executions, for which the human fiends
      would receive eighty pounds. Then the chiefs engaged in the plot would
      meet and divide the spoils at an entertainment to which they gave the name
      of "the blood-feast."
    
    
      The executions under this system amounted to as many as forty a month in
      the city of London alone. Another evil which exists to this very day is to
      be traced to William and Mary's reign; it is the establishment of
      gin-shops. William gave encouragement to the manufactories of spirituous
      liquors, the imbibing of which is the source of most of the crime and
      sorrow of the world, and any one who has noticed the number of gin-shops
      in London, and the drinking saloons in other cities, can scarcely be blind
      to the evil they tend to promote. [395] a
      name="link395" id="link395">Before King William returned to England
      again much blood had been shed, and the wealth of both France and Great
      Britain was nearly exhausted. When Louis XIV. was discussing the probable
      termination of the war he said: "Ah, the last guinea will carry the
      victory." He was right, for the people of both countries were heavily
      taxed, and it was only a question who should hold out longer with their
      guineas.
    
    
      Whenever the king was with her, Mary abandoned all government cares, and
      took to needlework, in which she was imitated by her ladies. Her favorite
      occupation in this line was the making of knotted fringe of white
      flax-thread, that no doubt closely resembled the macramé lace of the
      present day. The Dutch ladies knitted, and even took their work to church,
      and kept their fingers employed while listening to a sermon.
    
    
      A.D. 1693. King William's return from Flanders
      was celebrated by a grand thanksgiving dinner at Guildhall, and another at
      the armory of the Tower, where their majesties dined in state, and were
      waited on by the master architects and workmen in masonic aprons and
      regalia. It was the king's policy to gain favor with his English subjects,
      because he had only come among them for more supplies, and was off again
      within four months, to remain until towards the end of the year.
    
    
      During that interval Queen Mary's navy met with two disastrous defeats,
      and the king had lost the hard-fought, bloody battle of Landen in
      Flanders. The people of England were groaning under the weight of heavy
      taxation, and general dissatisfaction with the government was openly
      expressed. There had been several dishonest prime ministers; but previous
      to his departure the king appointed Charles Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury, to
      that important position.
    
    
      We have not said anything about the little Duke of [396] a
      name="link396" id="link396">Gloucester for a long time; but it must
      not, therefore, be supposed that he was forgotten either by his mother or
      his royal aunt. He lived at Campden House, and was taken daily to visit
      the queen whenever she was at Kensington.
    
    
      A.D. 1694. Princess Anne was very desirous that
      her son should be made a Knight of the Garter; but her relations with the
      queen were such that she dared not ask it. However, she sent the prince to
      visit her majesty one day with a broad blue ribbon passed over his
      shoulder and fastened down on the left side as a reminder. No notice was
      taken of it; but the child had evidently been taught that something was to
      be accorded him in connection with the ribbon, for when the queen offered
      him a brilliantly-colored bird, he looked very sober, and said, "He would
      not rob her majesty of it."
    
    
      When he had attained his fifth year, the prince's mother thought it high
      time that he should be put into masculine attire, and consulted her
      husband about it, saying that the clothing he was wearing interfered with
      his military amusements. An order was accordingly given to Lady
      Fitzhard-ing, who procured for the child a suit of white cloth with silver
      loops and buttons, and a periwig. Under his waistcoat he wore a stiff
      corset that hurt him dreadfully. His tailor, Mr. Hughes, was sent for to
      remedy the trouble, and when he appeared at Campden House he was surprised
      to find himself surrounded by a score of mimic soldiers,       the little
      prince having summoned his regiment to punish the man who had caused him
      pain. There is no telling how far the little urchins would have gone, for
      they were beating and mauling Mr. Hughes at a great rate, when Lewis
      Jenkins, the usher, appeared to inquire into the cause of the racket. An
      explanation followed, and, upon the tailor's giving a faithful promise
      that he would alter the stays to fit his little highness, he was released.
      [397]One
      day the little regiment was busily drilling in Kensington Gardens, while
      the king and queen watched their movements with a great deal of interest.
      Suddenly the Duke of Gloucester approached his uncle, and gravely offered
      himself and his whole troop for the Flemish war. Then turning to Queen
      Mary, he added: "My mamma once had guards as well as you; why has she not
      now?" Her majesty colored and looked surprised, while the king offered the
      drummer of the regiment two guineas as a reward for the noise he could
      make; whereupon the little fellow drowned any further awkward questioning.
      Of course, Queen Mary knew very well that the prince could not remember
      when his mother's guard had been dismissed, therefore all the knowledge he
      had of it was what he had heard from his parents.
    
    
      The Duke of Gloucester's soldiers were often a nuisance to the
      neighborhood; for on their way home after drill they would enter houses on
      the road to London, and help themselves to any dainty bit of food the
      larder happened to contain. This they did in imitation of the soldiers
      quartered in the vicinity of London, and felt especially privileged as
      "Gloucester's men." Like most people who ape others, it was the bad
      qualities these little boys selected.
    
    
      Next time King William returned from Flanders he found the bribery and
      corruption in his government just as bad as ever, and the new prime
      minister worse than the old ones had been. Parliament was opened, and
      charges of the gravest character were brought even against the queen's
      immediate attendants, in some of whom she reposed the utmost confidence.
      This was a source of great trouble to Queen Mary, and in the midst of it
      Archbishop Tillotson fell dead in the pulpit one Sunday while performing
      the service.
    
    
      Christmas was approaching, and the royal pair decided [398] a
      name="link398" id="link398">to spend it quietly at Kensington Palace.
      By the twentieth of December the queen was so ill that she must have had
      some doubts as to her recovery, for she sat up at her secretary the whole
      night examining and burning papers that she desired nobody to see. Perhaps
      this occupation aggravated her illness, for she grew worse, and two days
      later was considered in danger. Princess Anne sent to ask permission to
      wait on her majesty. The message was delivered to the first
      lady-in-waiting, who went into the bed-chamber where the queen lay, and in
      a few moments returned with the message, "That the king would send an
      answer the next day."
    
    
      But the only message received by the Princess Anne was a request to
      postpone her visit, because it was necessary to keep the queen as quiet as
      possible. The king was so distressed at his wife's danger that he had his
      camp-bed removed to her room, and remained with her night and day.
    
    
      At last Archbishop Tennison, who had replaced Tillotson, informed the
      queen that her end was drawing near. She was not at all surprised, and
      said, "That she thanked God she had left nothing to the last hour; she had
      then nothing to do but to look up to God and submit to His will."
    
    
      Then the last rites of the church were administered; but the queen did not
      die until the twenty-eighth of December, in the sixth year of her reign,
      and the thirty-third of her age. Not a word had the dead woman left for
      the sister with whom she had quarrelled; not an expression of sorrow or
      regret for the father whom she had injured.
    
    
      All the members of the House of Commons marched in the funeral procession,
      and Queen Mary was interred at Westminster Abbey.
    
    
      Queen Mary had desired to convert Greenwich Palace [399] a
      name="link399" id="link399">into a retreat for seamen, which work she
      had begun after the battle of La Hogue, as we have seen. After her death
      King William reproached himself for having neglected her wishes in this
      respect. He lost no time in ordering a plan which was supplied by the
      well-known architect, Christopher Wren, and soon a magnificent building
      arose in place of the one that had been burned down. The king did not live
      to see the completion of this asylum, otherwise a statue of the real
      foundress would have graced the court. However, the building itself is a
      noble monument to the memory of Queen Mary II. [400] a

      CHAPTER XII. ANNE, QUEEN-REGNANT OF GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND.
    
    
      (A.D. 1694-1714.)
    
    
      We have already
      heard a great deal about Anne, because up to the death of her sister,
      Queen Mary, their lives are so closely connected that it is impossible to
      understand some of the incidents without mentioning both sisters. The
      death of Mary brought Princess Anne more into public notice as heir
      presumptive to the throne, though it was many years before she became
      Queen of England. Heretofore, as we have seen, she lived like a private
      person at Berkeley House, and had not even been permitted to appear at
      court, because of the ill-feeling that existed between her and her sister
      Mary. Lord and Lady Marlborough, whose devotion to Princess Anne had
      seriously offended the queen, still continued her warm friends, and the
      princess wrote letters to her father filled with professions of loyalty
      and affection as before. King James did not attach much importance to
      them; but how could he, poor man, after the sad experience he had had. He
      knew perfectly well that his daughter merely consulted her own interest
      whether she appeared in the light of his friend or his enemy; for never
      was a father worse treated than poor James had been by both his daughters.
    
    
      The Duke of Gloucester was with his mother when Queen Mary's death was
      announced, and his attendants were surprised at the indifference he
      manifested. He had been fond of his royal aunt; but as he was only five
      years
    
    
      [401]
    
    
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Original
    
    
      [403]of
      age, he could not comprehend the full significance of death, and like most
      children, was more interested in those people and objects that immediately
      surrounded him. It was otherwise with his mother, for she and her sister
      had loved each other devotedly in early years; and when the grave closed
      over Queen Mary's body, all enmity was forgotten, and Princess Anne could
      only remember that a once fondly loved relative was irrevocably lost. The
      old affection returned, and she wept bitter tears. The memory of her
      sister made her heart warm towards King William, whom she had thoroughly
      detested for several years. Perhaps his desperate grief touched her, for
      he shut himself up in Kensington Palace and gave vent to the most
      agonizing sobs. Those who knew him best were surprised that a man of his
      disposition could take sorrow so to heart; but he had lost a devoted wife
      and friend,       one who had sought to place him in the foremost ranks on
      every occasion, and to gain for him the credit and praise that was really
      due to her own superior talent for ruling. William III. was well aware of
      this, and of the fact that henceforth his hold on the crown was by no
      means secure. His only right to his lofty position was through his wife,
      and now that she was removed might not a breath deprive him of it? While
      the war lasted he was compelled to absent himself from England nearly half
      the year. Hitherto Queen Mary had supplied his place, who was to do so
      now? His position seemed difficult and dangerous. One day, when he was
      sitting alone with his head bowed down in grief, Lord Somers entered the
      room. The king took no notice of him whatever. After waiting a few
      moments, Somers approached and stated the cause of his intrusion, which
      was a proposition he desired to make that the hostility of the court
      towards Princess Anne should terminate.
    
    
      "My lord, do as you please; I can think of no business," was the reply of
      the sorrow-stricken king. [404] a
      name="link404" id="link404">Lord Somers chose to construe this
      undecided answer into consent, and so set to work to negotiate a
      reconciliation through Lord Sunderland, by whose advice Princess Anne was
      induced to write the following letter to the king:       
    
    
      Sir,       I beg your majesty's favorable acceptance of my sincere and
      hearty sorrow for your great affliction in the loss of the queen. And I do
      assure your majesty I am as sensibly touched with this sad misfortune as
      if I had never been so unhappy as to have fallen into her displeasure.
    
    
      It is my earnest desire your majesty would give me leave to wait upon
      you as soon as it can be without inconvenience to yourself, and without
      danger of increasing your affliction, that I may have the opportunity
      myself, not only of repeating this, but assuring your majesty of my real
      intentions to omit no occasion of giving you constant proofs of my sincere
      respect and concern for your person and interest, as becomes, sir,
    
    
      Your majesty's affectionate sister and servant, Anne.
    
    
      The princess must have felt her welfare at stake as well as that of her
      son; otherwise she could not have been induced to write so dutiful a
      letter to the brother-in-law who had treated her so unkindly for many
      years. It was Archbishop Tennison who took it upon himself to deliver the
      letter, and at the same time to say all he could in praise of the
      disinterested conduct of the princess during the period when she was
      debarred from appearing at court. King William knew better, but gave the
      archbishop credit for honesty, and concluded that he might with safety
      trust to the fidelity of Anne now, because her interest was closely linked
      with his own. He therefore sent her some of the late queen's jewels, in
      token of reconciliation, and appointed an interview at Kensington Palace.
    
    
      Anne was in such a dreadful state of health, and so puffed up with dropsy,
      that she had to be carried to the presence-chamber in a chair. Both she
      and the king were affected to tears when they met, and after a few remarks
      they retired to a private room, where they conversed for  span
      class="pagenum">[405]nearly
      three-quarters of an hour. The details of that interview are not known;
      but it is certain that the royal brother and sister-in-law agreed to
      combine all their interests against James II. and his son, and William
      further consented to an amnesty with the Earl of Marlborough, for whom he
      felt supreme contempt.

      When Bentinck was consulted as to his opinion of the reconciliation, he
      warned the king against putting any trust in the professions of either
      Marlborough or the princess; but he had withdrawn himself from the side of
      his once beloved master for some mysterious reason, and another was
      required to take his place, so in course of time we shall find the
      much-despised earl courted and honored by King William.  span
      class="pagenum">[406]The
      reconciliation between Anne and the king had not been effected too soon,
      for the Jacobites began to agitate the question whether the princess was
      not the real Queen of Great Britain, and Ireland; and those provinces that
      were not kept in subjection by the dread of a standing army were prepared
      to rebel against a foreign king, who held his position merely by
      permission of parliament. These were all prepared to support Anne, with
      the hope that once placed upon the throne she would not hesitate to resign
      in favor of her father and brother, because her friendly correspondence
      with the former was known. Many important arrests were made, and many
      agitators escaped from the kingdom. Anne continued writing to her father,
      and made promises that she had no idea of fulfilling; but he was not
      deceived, though he deeply deplored the alliance she had formed for the
      second time with his enemy.
    
    
      When William returned to Flanders he left no power in the hands of Anne
      whatever, but the council of nine took entire charge of government
      affairs, and the Archbishop of Canterbury was one of their number.
    
    
      King William's reign, contrary to the expectation of all the statesmen of
      Europe, was decidedly more prosperous and more tranquil after Queen Mary's
      death than it had been during her life.
    
    
      In course of time Princess Anne's health improved, and she became a great
      huntress. This exercise was begun for the cure of gout and dropsy, but was
      continued on account of the pleasure the princess derived from it. She was
      too fat to hunt on horseback, but went in a sort of sedan chair, hung
      between two very high wheels, and drawn by one horse. How the stag was
      ever brought down when hunted from such an equipage is a mystery that
      experienced sportsmen may be able to solve. [407] a
      name="link407" id="link407">The young Duke of Gloucester still lived
      at Campden House, because it was considered a healthful spot, and his
      health was so delicate that it was feared he might die if not carefully
      watched. He had a disease called water on the brain, which made his head
      larger than it ought to have been, and often threatened to prostrate him.
      There were times when he could not bear to go up or down stairs without
      having a person to hold him on either side. This fancy was indulged for a
      time, but at last it was attributed to cowardice, for there was no one
      sufficiently well-informed as to the nature of his disease to suspect that
      he felt dizzy. His mother once shut herself up in a room with him for an
      hour to try and reason him out of being led about, as he was then past
      five years of age, but he obstinately refused to stir alone until he was
      whipped again and again. The fact of a child of his vivacity fearing to go
      up and down stairs without assistance ought to have been sufficient
      evidence that something was wrong with him; but after the whipping, which
      certainly ought not to have been administered to a person suffering from
      any disease of the brain, the young prince dispensed with support, though
      his head must often have ached and felt very confused. Prince George of
      Denmark was particularly anxious that no infirmity should be observed in
      his son, because he could not bear to have him held up to ridicule by the
      scribblers, who considered no calamity sacred from the merciless attacks
      of their pens. The brutal articles that appeared daily against the "the
      young pretender" prompted him to shield his son from similar ones by the
      opposite party. That was all very well; but disease cannot be whipped out
      of anybody, and so the prince was encouraged to fight against his malady
      until he became very ill. Doctor Radcliffe was summoned from Oxford, and
      did all he could for the little sufferer, who had a fever which kept him
      in bed [408]two
      whole weeks. But he was not permitted to be quiet, for his small soldiers
      were constantly at his bedside blowing their trumpets, beating drums,
      building toy fortifications, and making a great deal more noise most of
      the time than was good for the invalid. The old nurse of Princess Anne
      sent the sick boy a large doll dressed as a warrior by one of his
      attendants named Wetherby. This present occasioned much indignation among
      the young soldiers, because it was full six months since any of them had
      condescended to play with toys of so effeminate a nature, and sentence of
      destruction was immediately pronounced on the doll. No sooner was it
      carried into effect than it was decided that the messenger ought to
      receive punishment, too.
    
    
      A.D. 1695. But Wetherby knew what a rough lot of
      boys surrounded the prince, and, taking warning by the treatment the doll
      had received at their hands, hastened down Campden-Hill and hid himself.
      In the afternoon the unfortunate fellow was discovered and captured,       four
      grown men having been pressed into the service,       and locked up all
      night. The next morning he was brought before the Duke of Gloucester, who
      pronounced his sentence. Wetherby was forthwith bound, hand and foot,
      mounted on a large hobby-horse and soused all over with water from large
      syringes. This was all done for the amusement of the duke; and as Wetherby
      had taken part on various occasions in playing similar jokes on the men
      who assisted the boys, they showed him no mercy now. When the poor
      prisoner was half-drowned, he was drawn into the presence of the invalid,
      who enjoyed immensely his woeful plight.
    
    
      The following summer change of air was strongly recommended for the royal
      boy by Dr. Radcliffe, and, after seeking accommodation at several
      watering-places, the Princess [409] a
      name="link409" id="link409">Anne decided to take him to Twickenham.
      There she was offered three adjoining houses which belonged to Mrs.
      Davies, a gentlewoman more than eighty years of age, who had belonged to
      the court of Charles I. This lady was bright, cheerful, healthy, and
      excessively pious. She was simple in her habits, and had lived on fruit
      and herbs nearly all her life. She was well-born and rich, and owned a
      large estate, on which were planted a number of fine fruit trees. Her
      cherries, which were just ripe when the princess went to Twickenham, were
      the finest in all the country around; and the old lady gave the people of
      the royal household full permission to gather as many as they chose,
      providing that they would not injure her trees, of which she was very
      proud.
    
    
      At the end of a month Princess Anne ordered her treasurer to hand Mrs.
      Davies a hundred guineas for rent and the trouble her people had given;
      but the aged hostess positively refused to accept a farthing, and when
      pressed to receive the money, she indignantly arose, and, letting the
      gold-pieces that had been placed in her lap, roll all over the floor,
      quietly walked out of the room. The princess was astonished at such
      generosity, and declared that, although it would have been a pleasure to
      her to reward the old lady to the utmost of her power, her feelings must
      not be hurt by a further offer of money.
    
    
      The little Duke of Gloucester formed such a warm attachment for Mrs.
      Davies that he loved to nestle in her lap and confide to her all his
      secret woes. His younger and fairer associates, who lavished flattery and
      attention on him, were not half so attractive as the honest dame, who,
      having nothing to gain or lose, always told him the truth. The royal boy's
      religious education had not been neglected; prayers had been read to him
      twice every day by his chaplain; but he never knew what they meant,  span
      class="pagenum">[410]nobody had
      taken the trouble to explain them; and he had naturally paid little
      attention to what he had failed to understand. Mrs. Davies soon
      comprehended where the difficulty lay; and it was from her lips that the
      duke learned the Lord's Prayer, the Creed, the Ten Commandments, and
      several hymns, all of which were carefully and patiently explained until
      they were made clear to his infant mind.
    
    
      One Sunday, when the princess was preparing to go to church, her son asked
      if he might accompany her. She was surprised, because he had never made
      such a request before, but gave permission. Then the little Duke of
      Gloucester ran to inform his governess, Lady Fitzharding, who asked him if
      he would say the psalms,       a performance to which he had always
      objected.
    
    
      "I will sing them," proudly replied the boy; thus showing the effect of
      his aged friend's instruction.
    
    
      One day, while the princess was making her toilet, the boy looked up into
      her face and asked: "Mamma, why have you two chaplains, and I but one?"
    
    
      "Pray," returned the mother, with an amused smile, "what do you give your
      one chaplain?" She merely asked this question to hear what sort of a reply
      her son would make, and to find out whether he knew that the chaplains of
      the royal household received no pay.
    
    
      The little duke looked at her earnestly for a moment, and then said:
      "Mamma, I give him his liberty!"
    
    
      The princess laughed heartily at the little boy's unconscious repartee.
    
    
      On his return to Campden House the Duke of Gloucester found his soldier
      company posted as sentinels on guard, and they received their commander
      with presented arms and all the honors of war. After that the daily drill
      took place regularly on an open plain, called Wormwood Common.  span
      class="pagenum">[411]One morning
      the duke fell with a pistol in his hand, and hurt his forehead against it.
      The wound was still bleeding when he reached Campden House, and the ladies
      began to pity him; but he put on a bold air and told them "that a bullet
      had grazed his forehead, but that as a soldier he could not cry when
      wounded."
    
    
      There was so much ceremony observed among the royal attendants all the
      time that Mr. Tratt, the tutor, considered it an infringement of his
      rights when Jenkins, the Welsh usher, undertook to give the Duke of
      Gloucester his first lessons in fencing and mathematics.
    
    
      The child ran to his mother every time he learned anything new to make a
      display of his knowledge; but Jenkins was told to "mind his own business"
      by those who considered that he ought to be otherwise employed. Lady
      Fitz-harding, in particular, found great fault with his filling the duke's
      head with such "stuff" as mathematics, and seemed to regard the figures
      drawn in geometry some sort of magic-signs that savored of witchcraft. But
      her husband eased her mind by assuring her that Lewis Jenkins "was a good
      youth, who had read much, but meant no harm." The princess ordered Lord
      Fitzharding to hinder Jenkins from teaching her son anything, because he
      might get wrong ideas, that it would be hard to correct when he began to
      study according to the regular method.
    
    
      Shortly after she saw the duke fencing with a wooden sword, and defending
      himself against the attack of an imaginary foe. "I thought I forbade your
      people to fence with you," observed her royal highness.
    
    
      "Oh yes, mamma," replied the child; "but I hope you will give them leave
      to defend themselves when I attack them."
    
    
      He never tired of hearing tales from ancient history, and could recite
      many exploits of the heroes, much to the disgust [412] a
      name="link412" id="link412">of the tutor, who knew that the knowledge
      had not been imparted by him.
    
    
      On the return of her brother-in-law in the autumn, Princess Anne wrote him
      a letter of congratulation on his conquest of Namur. The one she wrote
      after the death of the queen had resulted so favorably to herself that she
      expected equally pleasant effects from the present one; but she soon found
      her mistake, for the king had come home in a bad humor, and treated her
      letter with silent contempt. Perhaps congratulations seemed out of place
      when he remembered that the lives of twelve thousand men had paid the cost
      of his victory, besides an enormous sum of money.
    
    
      A few weeks later he made a state visit to Campden House, when the duke
      received him with military honors. The king was very much amused, and
      asked the child "whether he had any horses yet."
    
    
      "Oh yes," replied he, "I have one live horse and two dead ones."
    
    
      "You keep dead horses, do you?" asked his majesty. "That is not the way
      with soldiers, for they always bury their dead horses."
    
    
      The little duke was impressed by what his uncle had said, and determined
      to be as much like a real soldier as possible; so he summoned his regiment
      as soon as the king had departed, and buried his two hobby horses that he
      had designated as dead ones. A Shetland pony, no larger than a
      Newfoundland dog, was his riding animal.
    
    
      During the king's absence Princess Anne had received all due honors, as
      first royal lady of the realm, and this gratified her ambition entirely;
      but when his majesty thought fit to confer upon his favorite, Bentinck,
      and his heirs forever, all the rights of the Princess of Wales, not only
      was Anne justly indignant at seeing her son deprived [413] a
      name="link413" id="link413">of his privileges, but the whole country
      viewed the action with extreme disfavor, and the House of Commons
      contested it with great warmth. William III. was compelled to revoke the
      grant; but the hard feeling it had aroused in the mind of Princess Anne
      remained, and his majesty took no pains to conciliate her. On the
      contrary, as soon as he was convinced that the removal of his wife had not
      affected his position, he began to regret the alliance he had formed with
      his sister-in-law, and treated her with marked disrespect. He even forbade
      the members of the clergy to bow before her previous to beginning their
      sermons, according to the custom in the Church of England at that time. To
      be sure, the Dean of Canterbury and the rector of St. James's Church did
      not pay the slightest attention to the prohibition, and the princess
      always returned their salute with marked civility.
    
    
      King William had become dreadfully irritable since the death of his wife.
      We know that he was naturally surly and ill-natured; but his fondness for
      Holland gin excited him to such a degree that he would cane his inferior
      servants if they chanced to neglect even the most trifling duty. The way
      they tried to dodge his majesty when he was in an unusually fractious mood
      was amusing, and the members of the royal household called those who were
      obliged to submit to the blows "King William's Knights of the Cane."
    
    
      A French servant, who had charge of his majesty's guns, and who attended
      him in his shooting excursions in the Hampden Court park, forgot one day
      to provide himself with shot, although it was his duty to load the
      fowling-piece. He did not dare to acknowledge his neglect, but kept
      charging the gun with powder only, and every time the king fired would
      exclaim, "I did never,       no, never, see his majesty miss before." Thus
      are petty tyrants invariably deceived.
    
    
      A.D. 1696.
    
    
      [414]
    
    
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Original
    
    
      As the anniversary of King William's birthday approached there was a
      flutter of excitement at court, and all the beaux and belles of the
      English nobility flocked to town to attend the grand reception that was to
      take place. This was no pleasure to William, for he had been aided in such
      matters by his wife, who had known better how to conduct herself on such
      occasions than he did; and now that he had to undertake a ceremony which
      he disliked, with no one one to guide him, he felt his bereavement more
      deeply than ever. If he had been friendly towards Anne he might have
      enlisted her services, and escaped from some of the etiquette that was so
      irksome to him. But instead of that, he actually treated her with no more
      consideration than he showed to the wives of the aldermen and common
      councilmen, and kept her waiting with them for nearly two hours in the
      ante-chamber. This insult was repeated on several similar occasions, until
      the [415]public
      began to murmur, and the English officials who had access to the king took
      the liberty of reminding him that her royal highness was his superior by
      birth, and that the nation would not submit to his showing contempt
      towards their princess. Then his majesty deemed it prudent to alter his
      arrangements, and at the future receptions the lord chamberlain was
      instructed to usher her royal highness into the presence chamber
      immediately on her arrival. After that, all her attendants were treated
      with respect, and the king showed himself enough of a diplomatist to
      extend favors that would redound to his own credit. He called at Campden
      House and requested Princess Anne and her husband to take possession of
      St. James's Palace as soon as they pleased, and further surprised them
      with the announcement that as a garter had fallen into his possession by
      the death of Lord Strafford, he intended to bestow it upon his nephew, the
      Duke of Gloucester. This visit was succeeded by one from Burnet, the
      Bishop of Salisbury, who came with the information that a meeting of the
      Order of the Garter would be held on the sixth of January, and asked the
      duke if the thought of becoming a knight did not please him. "I am more
      pleased at the king's favor," was the discreet reply.
    
    
      It was King William himself who buckled on the little duke's garter and
      presented the star, both of which he was to wear daily forever after,       though
      that office was usually performed by one of the knights.
    
    
      After resting for awhile in his mother's room on his return to
      Campden-House, the duke went to his play-room, where he met Harry Scull,
      his favorite drummer. "Your dream has come true, Harry," gladly announced
      the royal boy, displaying his star and garter to his companion, who had
      dreamed that he saw his commander so adorned.
    
    
      At this period the duke's malady seems to have been [416] a
      name="link416" id="link416">for a time arrested, for he looked well
      and was full of animal spirits. This rendered his mother happier than she
      had been in many a day, besides she was residing in the palace of her
      ancestors, her rank was recognized by the king and his government, and she
      regularly received a liberal income. Windsor Castle was granted to her for
      her summer residence, though it was occasionally shared by her royal
      brother-in-law, who had reserved for his exclusive use Hampton Court and
      Kensington Palace. There was only one flaw in the happiness of Princess
      Anne at this period, and that was a report that when the king returned
      from his summer campaign there was a probability that he would bring home
      a Dutch bride.
    
    
      Meanwhile, the Duke of Gloucester was taken to Windsor, for the first
      time, in company with his parents. The princess ordered Mrs. Atkinson to
      show her son the royal apartments in the castle, and to give him a
      description of the pictures. The child was particularly pleased with St.
      George's Hall, and clapped his hands with delight as he declared that the
      noble apartment would be just the place for him to fight his battles in.
      Next day four boys were summoned from Eaton School to be the duke's
      companions. They were young Lord Churchill, a mild, good-natured boy,
      somewhat older than the duke, son of Lord and Lady Marlborough, the two
      Bathursts, and Peter Boscawen. As soon as they appeared, the duke proposed
      that a battle should be fought in St. George's Hall, and sent for all his
      pikes, swords, and muskets. The music gallery, and the stairs leading to
      it, were to represent the castle that he meant to besiege. Mrs. Atkinson
      and Lewis Jenkins were in attendance, and both were expected to take part
      in the battle. Young Boscawen and Peter Bathurst were the enemy, and had
      been secretly requested not to hurt the duke; but in the heat of the fray
      the latter lost the sheath [417] a
      name="link417" id="link417">from his sword, and before he made the
      discovery had wounded the duke in the neck.
    
    
      Jenkins stopped the battle to ascertain the nature of the wound; but,
      staunching the blood with his handkerchief, the youth rushed up the stairs
      into the enemy's garrison.
    
    
      When the battle was over, the duke asked Mrs. Atkinson if she had a
      surgeon near by.
    
    
      "Oh, yes," she replied, "bustling about to revive the soldiers who
      pretended to be dead or dying."
    
    
      "Pray make no jest of it," urged the child, "for Peter Bathurst has really
      wounded me in the battle."
    
    
      The hurt was bathed and plastered up, and no serious consequence resulted;
      but there are not, I fancy, many boys less than seven years of age who
      would have continued the game, as the duke did, with the blood trickling
      from a wound. The sight of blood terrifies some children. Not so with the
      Duke of Gloucester; for when he attended his first hunt at Windsor Park,
      the deer's throat was cut, after it had been shot, just at his feet. Then
      Mr. Massam, his page, dipped his hand in the blood and smeared it all over
      the duke's face. This excited great surprise; but on being informed that
      such was the custom at first seeing a deer slain, the mischievous little
      duke dipped his hands in the blood and besmeared the faces of Jenkins and
      all the boys.
    
    
      Princess Anne shrieked with terror one day when walking in the park with
      her husband to see her son roll down the hill of one of the castle
      fortifications, but he reassured her by declaring that when he was engaged
      in battles and sieges he would have to get used to descending such places.
      Prince George laughed, and always encouraged the child to such exploits
      with the hope of thereby making him more hardy.
    
    
      July 24, being the Duke of Gloucester's birthday, a [418] a
      name="link418" id="link418">grand banquet was given at St. George's
      Hall, at the king's expense, to the Knights of the Garter. The princess
      was present, and had the proud satisfaction of seeing her son walk in
      procession with the other knights from St. George's Chapel to the hall.
      All the gentlemen wore their splendid robes of the order, and took their
      places at the long tables in accordance with their rank. The little duke
      appeared in his plumes and all the gorgeous regalia that had been provided
      for him, and comported himself among the full-grown knights with wonderful
      dignity.
    
    
      In the evening the princess gave a splendid ball, and received all the
      nobility, many of whom came from different parts of the country to do
      honor to the occasion. The town of Windsor was illuminated, bells rang out
      merrily, and the bright blaze of bonfires lit up the surrounding scene for
      a great distance. There were besides fireworks on the terrace, which
      delighted the young duke beyond everything. The entertainment concluded
      with a musical drama, written expressly to celebrate the birthday.
    
    
      A few days later another festival to celebrate the wedding anniversary of
      Princess Anne and Prince George of Denmark was held. In the morning the
      royal couple went to visit their son, and found him superintending the
      firing of his little cannon in honor of the day. Three rounds were fired,
      which almost deafened the royal mamma, and excited her fears because of
      the quantity of gunpowder the duke had at his command. After this salute
      the boy approached his parents of his own accord, and, making a profound
      bow, said: "Papa, I wish you and mamma unity, peace, and concord,       not
      for a time, but forever." Of course the parents were charmed with the
      courtesy and respect of their little pet, and embraced him warmly.
    
    
      Some hours later, Jenkins said to him: "You made a fine compliment to
      their royal highnesses to-day, sir," [419] a
      name="link419" id="link419">whereupon the child returned, with
      gravity, "It was no compliment; it was sincere." Thus the little fellow
      constantly made remarks far beyond his years, and excited the wonder and
      admiration of all who surrounded him.
    
    
      A.D. 1697. At the beginning of the new year
      great excitement prevailed because of the discovery of a plot against the
      life of the king. Sir John Fenwick was discovered to be at the head of it,
      and was arrested on a charge of high treason. When he found that he was to
      suffer death without a regular trial, Sir John gave such extraordinary
      evidence against the majority of the nobility, including most of the
      king's ministers, whom he accused of corresponding with James II., that it
      was said if half of the number had been arrested for treason there would
      not have been enough left to hang or behead the rest. Marlborough was
      aimed at particularly; but that could have been no surprise to William,
      who knew that the earl not only wrote himself during Queen Mary's
      lifetime, but induced Princess Anne to do likewise. But his majesty winked
      at this accusation, because he was convinced that personal interest would
      now prompt the princess and her party to continue loyal to him. Fenwick
      was beheaded on Tower Hill, and all his revelations were quietly ignored,
      but the king took pains to possess himself of all Sir John's private
      papers. He also kept a remarkable sorrel shooting pony that had belonged
      to him; but of this animal we shall hear more in the future.
    
    
      Twelve gentlemen were executed the same year for plotting to waylay
      William and kill him, in the midst of his guards, on his return from a
      hunting expedition. The public were on the alert for any bit of news they
      could glean, and excitement ran high during the trials and executions,
      which took place at intervals throughout the year. Associations were
      formed for the protection of the king, [420] a
      name="link420" id="link420">and all sorts of addresses, containing
      assurances of loyalty, were sent to him from corporations and private
      individuals. The Duke of Gloucester was one of the latter. He caused one
      of his soldiers, older than himself, to write the following document, to
      which he affixed his signature, for he could read and write quite well for
      so young a person:       
    
    
      I, your majesty's most dutiful subject, had rather lose my life in your
      majesty's cause than in any man's else, and I hope it will not be long ere
      you conquer France. Gloucester.
    
    
      Another address from the same source, signed by all his boy-soldiers and
      the various members of the household, ran thus: "We, your majesty's
      subjects, will stand by you while we have a drop of blood." Such
      proceedings on the part of the little duke convinced William III. that the
      princess was bringing up her son as his partisan, and that at least was
      gratifying.
    
    
      He honored the festival given on the anniversary of Princess Anne's birth
      with his presence, and witnessed the introduction at court of the young
      duke, who appeared in a rich blue velvet coat. All the button-holes were
      studded with diamonds, and each button was composed of a superb brilliant,
      some of which had belonged to Queen Mary, and were presented by the king
      to her sister after her death.
    
    
      When the boy had been installed as Knight of the Garter, his majesty had
      presented him with a jewel worth seven hundred pounds, which he wore also
      on this occasion. His flowing white periwig did not detract from the
      beauty of his clear bright complexion and soft blue eyes; and the little
      duke was the centre of attraction, surrounded by a bevy of lords and
      ladies, who flocked to her royal highness' drawing-room.
    
    
      The king was very fond of his little nephew, and, indeed,  span
      class="pagenum">[421]of all
      children, as this anecdote goes to prove: He was waiting one day in a
      private room for one of his secretaries, who was rather later than usual,
      when a gentle tap was heard on the door. "Who is there?" asked the king.
      "Lord Buck," was the reply; whereupon the king arose, opened the door and
      beheld a little boy four years of age. It was young Lord Buckhurst, son of
      the Lord High Chamberlain.
    
    
      "And what does Lord Buck want?" asked William.
    
    
      "I want you to be my horse; I have waited for you a long time."
    
    
      With an amiable smile, his majesty took hold of the wagon, and dragged the
      little noble up and down the long gallery until he was satisfied. From the
      matter-of-fact way in which this favor was received by the child, there
      was ample proof that King William was not on duty as horse for the first
      time.
    
    
      A.D. 1698. Up to this year the education of the
      Duke of Gloucester had been left in his mother's charge, because he was by
      no means strong, and it was not considered advisable to push him too fast.
      He had now arrived at the age of eight, and like all other royal children
      he would probably be given in charge to some great noble or clergyman. His
      mother dreaded the idea of parting with the delicate child, whom she had
      reared with so much difficulty, and was willing to make any sacrifice
      rather than to do so. Parliament voted the enormous sum of fifty thousand
      pounds per annum for the education and establishment of the Duke of
      Gloucester, but the king had power to dispose of the child. This was what
      alarmed the fond mother, for she knew that if he chose to exercise this
      power his majesty could annoy her excessively. It was therefore happiness
      to find that he only insisted on two points: one was to manage to pay out
      as little of the fifty thousand pounds [422] a
      name="link422" id="link422">per annum, as possible; the other was that
      Dr. Burnet, Bishop of Salisbury, should fill the post of preceptor. This
      appointment was by no means agreeable to the princess, but the king was
      inexorable, and she was forced to submit. The duke was to live at Windsor,
      and the bishop was to have ten weeks of each year to attend to duties that
      would oblige him to give his pupil a vacation. Strange to say, the Earl of
      Marlborough was appointed chief governor to the young duke notwithstanding
      the king's former hatred of him. But this is not so remarkable as it may
      at first appear, if we consider that the majority of the council of nine
      were Marlborough's friends, who knew his power and the influence he
      exercised over the mind of the heiress to the throne. The appointment was
      therefore popular with them, particularly as he was of their number. Then
      again, instead of believing for a moment that in the event of his death,
      Marlborough and Princess Anne would desire to recall King James or his
      son, the king calculated that they would renounce any claim but that of
      the Duke of Gloucester, over whose mind the earl would have established an
      empire, and in whose interest he would betray the distant heir. The
      appointment of Marlborough was eminently satisfactory to the princess, and
      there were few alterations made in the list she sent of other officers for
      her son's household.
    
    
      Lady Marlborough continued in the Princess Anne's household, but after her
      husband's lofty appointment she became somewhat arrogant and overbearing.
      The princess could not help noticing this change, which extended even to
      herself, and sometimes she would let fall a word or two of complaint to
      Abigail Hill, an humble relation of Lady Marlborough, to whom she was
      indebted for her position at court.
    
    
      A.D. 1699. During the next year or two Princess
      [423]Anne
      continued her court with unusual splendor, while the little duke studied
      so hard that all his vivacity disappeared, and when he was ten years of
      age his face had a worn look, old enough for a youth of seventeen at
      least, and pitiful to behold.
    
    
      We have said very little about the duke's father, for the simple reason
      that he led an easy, luxurious sort of a life, inoffensive and void of
      ambition. Somebody said of him:
    
    
      "That, though he was not quite dead, he had to breathe hard to prevent
      being buried, because nobody perceived any other sign of life in him."
      Perhaps it would be well for mankind if other princes were as quiet;
      certainly he spared himself a deal of trouble by not interfering with
      public affairs.
    
    
      We have seen that Bishop Burnet was appointed preceptor to the Duke of
      Gloucester; he was at the same time almoner to her majesty, the princess,
      and one of the most conceited men that ever lived. He usually preached at
      St. James's, and although Queen Mary had declared that his were
      "thundering long sermons," he could not comprehend why the ladies at court
      failed to give him their undivided attention. It seems that the women of
      the seventeenth century would cast sly glances at the beaux in church, and
      examine the costumes of the belles just as they do in the present one; but
      Bishop Burnet would not submit to such disrespect towards his own sweet
      self. He wanted every eye fixed on him while he preached; so, after making
      several complaints to Princess Anne, he at last hit upon a remedy which
      met with her approval. It was to have the pews where the ladies sat so
      barricaded with high railings that the occupants could only see beyond
      them by raising their eyes, and as he was the only high object when in the
      pulpit, they must look at him or at no man. Of course this arrangement
      excited [424]indignation
      of the fair damsels no less than of the courtiers, one of whom vented his
      wrath by the composition of a ballad that he took good care should come
      under the notice of the intermeddling bishop. It ran thus:       
    
    
      
    
    
      "When Burnet perceived that the beautiful dames.
    
    
      Who flocked to the chapel of holy St. James.
    
    
      On their lovers alone their kind looks did bestow.
    
    
      And smiled not at him when he bellowed below,
    
    
      To the Princess he went,
    
    
      With a pious intent,
    
    
      This dangerous ill in the church to prevent.
    
    
      'Oh, madam,' he said, ' our religion is lost,
    
    
      If the ladies thus ogle the knights of the toast.
    
    
      
    
    
      "'Your highness observes how I labor and sweat,
    
    
      Their affections to raise and attention to get;
    
    
      And sure when I preach, all the world will agree,
    
    
      That their eyes and their ears should be pointed at me
    
    
      But now I can find
    
    
      No beauty so kind,
    
    
      My parts to regard or my person to mind;
    
    
      Nay, I scarce have the sight of one feminine face
    
    
      But those of Old Oxford and ugly Arglass.
    
    
      
    
    
      "'These practices, madam, my preaching disgrace.
    
    
      Shall laymen enjoy the just rights of my place?
    
    
      Then all may lament my condition so hard,
    
    
      Who thrash in the pulpit without a reward.
    
    
      Therefore pray condescend
    
    
      Such disorders to end,
    
    
      And to the ripe vineyard the laborers send,
    
    
      To build up the seats that the beauties may see
    
    
      The face of no brawling pretender but me.'
    
    
      
    
    
      "The Princess by the man's importunity prest,
    
    
      Though she laugh'd at his reasons allowed his request.
    
    
      And now Britain's nymphs in a Protestant reign
    
    
      Are locked up at prayers like the virgins in Spain."
    
    
      
    
    
      A.D. 1700. The eleventh birthday of the Duke of
      Gloucester was celebrated at Windsor with the usual rejoicings. The boy
      reviewed his soldiers, received and made presents, fired his cannon at
      intervals during the day, [425] a
      name="link425" id="link425">and presided over a grand banquet in the
      evening. His system was very much run down by the strain of hard study,
      and this day of excitement proved too much for him. The following morning
      found him with a sick headache and sore throat, and towards night he
      became delirious. The family physician reduced the little duke's vitality
      still further by bleeding him according to the custom of the times. He
      grew worse, and there was great lamentation in the royal household because
      the princess's quarrel with Dr. Radcliffe prevented his being summoned,
      for everybody had confidence in his skill. At last a messenger was
      dispatched with a humble request to the doctor to visit the little
      sufferer. After a great deal of urging he consented, and pronounced the
      disease scarlet fever. He asked who bled the duke. The physician in
      attendance replied that he had done so. "Then you have destroyed him, and
      you may finish him," said Radcliffe, "for I will not prescribe."
    
    
      Of course the learned man was much censured for wilfully refusing to save
      the child, but he knew only too well that all his efforts would have been
      of no avail. Five days after his birthday festival the little duke
      expired.
    
    
      Lord Marlborough, who had gone to Althorpe, was summoned to the sick bed
      of his youthful master, but arrived too late.
    
    
      The bereaved mother watched beside her dying boy to the end, hoping
      against hope; and when nothing remained but his lifeless body, she arose,
      and with an expression of sad resignation on her countenance, quietly left
      the room. Then her thoughts were directed towards the father she had
      wronged, and she wrote him a letter filled with the most penitent
      expressions, and telling him that she looked upon her cruel loss as a blow
      from Heaven in punishment of her cruelty towards him. Retribution had come
      at last! [426]At
      that moment, when the object in whom all her hopes were centered lay cold
      in death, Princess Anne yearned for the sympathy of the parent who had
      ever been most kind and indulgent to her, and she immediately sent her
      letter to St. Germain by express.
    
    
      Lord Marlborough forwarded the sad news to King William, but his majesty
      made no reply for three whole months. The reason for this neglect was
      because Anne had written to her father, and the king found it out,
      although it was managed, as she thought, very secretly. William had always
      shown so much affection for his nephew that his failing to send any
      message of condolence or sorrow was the more remarkable.
    
    
      The little duke's remains lay in state in the suite of apartments he had
      occupied, and afterwards they were removed to Westminster, to be interred
      in Henry VII.'s Chapel. The English ambassador at the court of France was
      placed in a very embarrassing position, because his sovereign did not
      order him how to proceed with regard to the Duke of Gloucester's death.
      The fact is William was in a fit of temper, possibly caused by the sad
      event, and so cared not how he perplexed others. Besides, although he had
      loved the dead boy, he despised the parents, and paid no more respect to
      their feelings than if they had lost a favorite dog. At last, after the
      expiration of two months, he ordered a fortnight's mourning, which was
      very little. Three months after the death of the little duke, King William
      condescended to write, not to the afflicted parents, but to Lord
      Marlborough, and this is a copy of the remarkable missive:       
    
    
      "I do not think it necessary to employ many words in expressing my
      surprise and grief at the death of the Duke of Gloucester. It is so great
      a loss to me, as well as to all England, that it pierces my heart with
      affliction."
    
    
      [427]
    
    
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Original
    
    
      [429]The
      same post carried a peremptory order that all the salaries of the duke's
      servants should be cut off from the day of his death.
    
    
      A.D. 1701. Thus we see that the king's heart was
      not so pierced with affliction as to prevent his having an eye to economy.
      It was even suspected that it was the approach of pay-day that prompted
      him to write at all; but the Princess Anne was so shocked at the king's
      meanness that she resolved to pay the salaries of her dead boy's servants
      out of her own purse rather than send them off at a moment's notice. She
      returned to St. James's Palace towards the end of the year, bowed down
      with desolation and sorrow.
    
    
      The death of the Duke of Gloucester was not much lamented in the political
      world, for his existence had been rather an obstacle to the designs of the
      various parties; but to his mother, aside from her deep sorrow, it proved
      an event of the utmost importance; for even in her own household her
      position was altered, and she was not treated with the same deference as
      before.
    
    
      Lady Marlborough was the first person by whom the change was made
      apparent, though she of all others had most reason to be grateful to
      Princess Anne. She had gone with her husband to Althorpe, just a short
      time before the little duke's death, to further a scheme that they had
      made between them. King William's health was so poor that they had reason
      to believe it would not be long before Anne would replace him on the
      throne. When that should occur, it was argued that she would be assisted
      in the government by certain statesmen, who would shrink from any
      cooperation with them, so they planned a strong family alliance that would
      greatly strengthen their influence. They were aided by the sly politician,
      Sunderland, and by Lord Godolphin, whose only son had, during the previous
      year, [430]married
      their eldest daughter. When this marriage took place Princess Anne
      presented the bride with five thousand pounds, and gave a similar sum to
      Lady Marlborough's younger daughter, Anne Churchill, when she married
      Sunderland's son.
    
    
      These two marriages formed the principal features in the Marlborough
      scheme for their own advancement when the proper time should come. For the
      purpose of doing away with formality when writing to her favorite, it had
      been early agreed that the princess should merely be addressed as Mrs.
      Morley, and Lady Marlborough as Mrs. Freeman, which brought them to the
      same level. Since her bereavement Princess Anne had become more humble,
      and Lady Marlborough more imperious. When the latter was absent she
      received three or four notes a day, some of which were signed "your poor,
      unfortunate, faithful Morley." But the indulgence and kindness of the
      princess had only spoiled the woman, who was so puffed up by prosperity as
      to render herself positively ridiculous. She even went so far as to avert
      her face and turn up her nose when she had any slight office to perform
      for her benefactress, as though there was something about her person that
      produced disgust. In course of time the princess began to notice what
      others had seen for a long while; but accident revealed to her one day the
      extent to which the ungrateful creature could go with her insults.
    
    
      One afternoon when Princess Anne was at her toilet, she requested Abigail
      Hill to fetch her a pair of gloves from the table in the adjoining room.
      Miss Hill passed into the room designated, leaving the door open behind
      her. There sat Lady Marlborough reading a letter. Miss Hill soon
      discovered that she had, by mistake, put on her royal highness' gloves,
      and gently called her attention to the fact. "My goodness!" exclaimed Lady
      Marlborough, [431] a name="link431"
      id="link431">"have I on anything that has touched the odious hands of
      that disagreeable woman? Take them away quickly," and she pulled off the
      gloves, which she threw violently to the ground. Miss Hill picked them up
      without a word, and left the room closing the door behind her. Lady
      Marlborough thus remained in ignorance that her disgraceful speech had
      been overheard; but Abigail Hill saw plainly that not a word of it had
      been lost on the princess, who never forgot or forgave the disgust
      manifested by the woman on whom she had lavished affection and favors.
      Fortunately, the princess had no other attendant besides the one she had
      despatched for the gloves, so the incident remained a secret for the time
      being. Lady Marlborough was made to feel on several occasions that she had
      seriously offended the princess, but was at a loss to know how or when.
      She could not ready have felt the disgust she expressed, because Princess
      Anne was renowned all over Europe for the beauty and delicacy of her hands
      and arms; but perhaps it was envy.
    
    
      Princess Anne had not taken off mourning for her son when news arrived of
      the death of her father. This event did not cause her a great deal of
      sorrow, nor did she think fit to take the slightest notice of the request
      he made in his farewell letter to her, that when William should die she
      would make way for her brother on the throne.
    
    
      King William was at Loo, in Holland, when James II.'s message of
      forgiveness was delivered to him, and he was so impressed by it that he
      sat in moody silence the entire day. That was his way of showing that he
      was painfully affected; but it did not remove the ill-feeling he felt
      towards the dead king for refusing to permit him to adopt his son,       a
      request he had made after the death of the Duke of Gloucester. Neither did
      it prevent his issuing a [432] a
      name="link432" id="link432">bill accusing the young Prince of Wales, a
      boy of twelve, of high treason. But he put on mourning for his uncle, and
      ordered his footmen and coaches to appear in black. All the nobles and the
      court of England imitated him, and mourning became the fashion.
    
    
      His majesty returned to England, as usual, in the autumn, and left the
      Earl of Marlborough in command of his military forces in Holland, feeling
      certain, as he said, that the talents of that general would enable him to
      continue in his stead should his death occur. And it did not seem far off,
      for William had been seriously ill, the effects of which had so reduced
      his already enfeebled frame that all who saw him knew he was not long for
      this world. Nevertheless, he busied himself with preparations for
      involving England in a war with France, the object being to divide Spain
      into three parts, to be claimed by Austria, Holland, and England. This was
      to prevent Louis XIV. from becoming too powerful by his influence over his
      grandson, who was heir to the Spanish throne.
    
    
      It was no other than John Fenwick's sorrel pony that brought William's
      warlike projects to a close. And this is how he did it: His majesty was
      fond of the pretty animal, and rode on him daily while superintending the
      excavation of a canal in Hampden Court grounds. It was on the twenty-first
      of January that he was riding about as usual, when suddenly the pony stuck
      one foot in a mole hill and fell, throwing his majesty over on his right
      shoulder, and breaking his collar bone. Some workmen assisted him to rise,
      and carried him to the palace, where the broken bone was soon set. The
      accident might not have proved serious had not William, with his usual
      obstinacy, insisted on driving to Kensington that night. The jolting of
      the carriage displaced the fractured bone, and he arrived in a state of
      exhaustion and suffering. The opera-
    
    
      [433]
    
    
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Original
    
    
      tion [435]had
      to be repeated, but it was several days before the patient could move.
      Even then his mind was filled with revenge, for he sent a message to
      parliament urging them to lose no time in passing the charge of high
      treason against little James Stuart, that had been under consideration
      since the preceding January. The very last act of this mighty monarch was
      the signing of this bill, to which he affixed his stamp a few hours before
      his death.
    
    
      On the first of March the royal sufferer was seized with cramps, but
      improved sufficiently to be able to walk in the gallery of Kensington
      Palace a few days later. Feeling fatigued from the exercise, he threw
      himself on a lounge and fell asleep in front of an open window. Two hours
      later he awoke with a chill, the precursor of death. Both the Prince and
      Princess of Denmark made repeated efforts to see the dying king, but to
      the very end he framed his lips into an emphatic "no!" every time the
      request was made. No one was admitted to the sick-room besides physicians
      and nurses, excepting the old favorites Bentinck, and Keppel, Earl of
      Albemarle. The latter arrived from a mission to Holland just before the
      king lost his speech, and gave his royal master information of the
      progress of his preparations for the commencement of war in the Low
      Countries. For the first time the dying warrior listened to such details
      with cold indifference, and at their close merely said: "I draw towards my
      end." Then handing Keppel the keys of his writing-desk, he bade that
      favorite take possession of the twenty thousand guineas it contained, and
      directed him to destroy all the letters enclosed in a certain cabinet.
    
    
      The next morning, when Bentinck entered the room, the king was speechless
      but conscious. He took his old friend's hand and pressed it to his heart
      for several minutes, [436] a name="link436"
      id="link436">and then expired. After his death a bracelet of Queen
      Mary's hair, tied with black ribbon, was found on his left arm.
    
    
      William III. was fifty-one years old, and had reigned thirteen years.
      [437]
    
    
      
    
    
    
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XIII.
    
    
      Bishop Burnet had
      watched at Kensington with a host of other clergymen and lords for the
      king's last gasp, and then hastened to St. James's Palace to be the first
      to prostrate himself before the new queen. But he was disappointed; for
      the Earl of Essex, lord of the bedchamber, whose duty it really was to
      communicate the news, had forestalled him. Burnet had never been popular
      with Anne, and on her accession he was treated with marked indifference,
      and turned out of his lodgings at court.
    
    
      A.D. 1702. All was business and bustle on that
      Sunday that witnessed the death of William III. The queen was receiving
      the crowd of politicians that filled her antechamber, anxious for a
      private audience before her recognition by the privy council took place.
    
    
      Among others, the queen's old uncle, the Earl of Clarendon, sent in his
      name and requested "admittance to his niece."
    
    
      Her majesty's reply was, "That if he was prepared to take the oath of
      allegiance to her as sovereign she was willing to receive him."
    
    
      Queen Anne answered thus because she remembered the nature of her uncle's
      former conversations with her, and knew that he had come to urge her to
      make way for her brother, the Prince of Wales. His reply confirmed this,
      for he said:
    
    
      "No, I come to talk to my niece; I shall take [438] a
      name="link438" id="link438">no other oath than I have taken." He
      remained true to this decision to the day of his death.
    
    
      But Queen Anne had another uncle, who was not quite so loyal to King
      James's son; this was Lord Rochester, who had been one of Queen Mary's
      ministers of state, and shared with Anne the government of her
      kingdom likewise.
    
    
      Both houses of parliament met and made speeches suitable to the occasion,
      then presented addresses of congratulation to the queen on her accession.
      She received them with much grace and dignity; and although she did not
      say much, everybody was impressed by the remarkable sweetness of her
      voice, which possessed a magic charm.
    
    
      A general mourning was ordered by the privy council for the deceased king;
      but as Queen Anne was already wearing black for her father, she chose
      purple to distinguish this occasion, and appeared in that color the day
      after William III. died.
    
    
      On the eleventh of March Queen Anne went in solemn state, attended by Lady
      Marlborough and two other ladies, to the House of Lords. She ascended the
      throne in her royal robes, and made an address that had been prepared by
      her ministers, concluding with a promise to do all in her power for the
      happiness and prosperity of England. Lord Marlborough carried the sword of
      state before her royal highness, who, at the close of the session,
      returned with Prince George to St. James's Palace.
    
    
      The Scotch council was summoned, and Anne was proclaimed by Lord Lyon,
      king-at-arms, as Anne I. Queen of Scotland. Then her majesty appointed
      April 23 for her coronation; and parliament voted her the same revenue
      that had been granted to King William.
    
    
      There were those who were delighted at the accession of Queen Anne; but
      the Dutch colony at Kensington were [439] a
      name="link439" id="link439">not of the number. The body of King
      William had been embalmed and removed to the prince's chamber at
      Westminster, where it lay in state; and the queen, with her husband,
      immediately took possession of the royal apartments at Kensington. There
      was something repulsive in this, though the room in which the king had
      breathed his last remained undisturbed for many years.
    
    
      After a great deal of discussion it was decided that the interment of King
      William's body should take place privately, and April 12, at midnight, was
      the time appointed.
    
    
      The procession started from Kensington, and was headed by an open chariot
      with the customary wax effigy seated as though the coffin had been
      beneath; but it was only placed there when the procession reached
      Westminster.
    
    
      During the funeral service the body was deposited in Henry VIII.'s Chapel,
      and afterwards it was interred in the same vault with Queen Mary II.
    
    
      Among her appointments, Queen Anne made the Duke of Devonshire
      lord-steward of her household; the Earl of Jersey, lord-chamberlain; Sir
      Edward Seymour, comptroller; and Peregrine Bertie, vice-chamberlain.
      Prince George was appointed to the high office of commander-in-chief of
      all the forces, both by sea and land. Lord Go-dolphin requested that her
      majesty would be pleased to reinstate Dr. Radcliffe; but she replied, "No!
      Radcliffe shall never send me word again when I am ill that my ailments
      are only vapors." Lady Marlborough used her influence to have Bentinck
      expelled from his office as keeper of the park at Windsor, with the least
      possible delay; for he had never been friendly to either herself or the
      queen, and such a chance for revenge could scarcely be overlooked.
    
    
      The public mind was soon occupied with the approaching coronation. Prince
      George was to take no part in it as [440] a
      name="link440" id="link440">sovereign, but in the previous reign he
      had been created Duke of Cumberland,       a title that placed him at the
      head of the list of peers, and gave him precedence of them all.
    
    
      At eleven o'clock on coronation morning the queen was carried in her sedan
      chair from St. James's to Westminster Hall, where she rested in a private
      room while the heralds marshalled the several classes of nobility
      according to their rank. Prince George of Denmark was preceded by the
      Archbishop of Canterbury, and the lord keeper of the Great Seal. He walked
      just in front of the queen with her state attendants, garter-king-at-arms,
      the lord mayor, and the high steward of England. The queen wore on her
      head a gold band set with costly gems, and her train was borne by the
      Duchess of Somerset, assisted by four young ladies of the bed-chamber, and
      the lord chamberlain. But this train must in some way have been made to
      hang from her majesty's chair, for she was suffering so much from gout in
      her feet that she could not walk in the procession. These attendants and
      train-bearers conducted her from the waiting-room to the grand hall, where
      she was placed beneath the canopy near the table, on which were spread the
      regalia. Lord Carlisle, the Duke of Devonshire, and the lord
      high-constable stood in readiness to distribute the various articles on
      the table to the persons appointed to carry them whenever her majesty
      should give the order. As soon as this, part of the ceremony was
      performed, the procession moved on to the Abbey, the path all the way to
      the royal platform in the church being covered with blue cloth, and strewn
      with evergreens and flowers. A company of guards lined the walk,
      consequently the cloth was not tom to bits to be distributed among the
      rabble, as had been the case at previous coronations. From Westminster
      Hall to the Abbey the train-bearers were, as before, the Duchess of
      Somerset,       a personal friend to the queen, and wife of  span
      class="pagenum">[441]the nearest
      relative of the blood royal then in England,       Lady Elizabeth Seymour,
      Lady Mary Hyde, and Lady Mary Pierrepoint, then a girl of thirteen, who
      later was known in the literary world as Lady Mary Wortley Montague. The
      queen was escorted by Lord Jersey, supported by the Bishops of Durham and
      Exeter, and guarded by the late king's favorite, Keppel, Earl of
      Albemarle, who was still retained as captain of the royal guard. He was
      the only member of King William's Dutch colony who had ever shown civility
      to the queen, and she showed her gratitude by continuing him in office.
      The coronation ceremony was conducted on the same plan as all the others
      we have recorded, therefore it is unnecessary to repeat the details. The
      ring used on this occasion was a superb ruby, on which was engraved the
      cross of St. George. It was placed on the fourth finger of her majesty's
      right hand. The ceremony concluded with the peers, archbishops, and
      prelates, headed by the Duke of Cumberland, paying homage to the queen.
      This was done by kissing her left cheek, and touching her crown while her
      pardon was read, and medals of silver and gold were distributed among the
      people. A grand anthem by the choir, accompanied by instrumental music,
      followed; then the trumpets sounded, and all the people shouted, "God save
      Queen Anne! Long live Queen Anne! May the queen live forever!"
    
    
      At the banquet in the evening Prince George of Denmark sat at her
      majesty's left hand, and care was taken that tables should be provided for
      members of the house of commons, who had complained of being neglected at
      the coronation banquet of William and Mary. On the whole, the ceremony was
      eminently satisfactory from beginning to end, even to the thieves who
      stole all the plate used at her majesty's table in Westminster Hall, as
      well as the finest of the table linen. Shortly after her coronation Queen
      Anne [442]knighted
      Simon Harcourt, and appointed him solicitor-general; and her uncle, Lord
      Rochester, was chosen for her prime minister. It was with the assistance
      and advice of this uncle that Queen Anne performed an act of benevolence
      that has made her name venerated in the Church of England ever since.
      Certain sums of money that she had a right to claim for every office she
      conferred in the church, she applied, instead, towards a fund for
      increasing the salaries of some of the inferior members of the clergy who
      were so poorly paid that they were scarcely able to live. Originally, the
      money so claimed had been for the support of crusades, but later it went
      to the crown, and the clergy were taxed for their whole profit of the
      first year, and one-tenth of the annual gain forever after. So relieved of
      this tax, and with their salaries increased besides, the clergy of the
      Church of England had reason to be grateful to their sovereign. This fund
      received the name of "Queen Anne's bounty," which it has borne to the
      present day.
    
    
      Throughout Queen Anne's reign there were so many contests that it will be
      necessary sometimes to mention the two parties between whom they occurred,
      though as little as possible will be said on the subject of politics, and
      none of the dry details and intricacies of the various projects shall be
      recounted. The two powerful parties to which we refer were called Whigs
      and Tories, and probably no one will object to knowing how they were
      distinguished.
    
    
      In the reign of Queen Anne the policy of the Whigs was to keep up a
      perpetual war against France, in order to prevent the son of James II.
      from claiming his right to the throne of England. They were opposed to the
      Church of Rome and equally so to the reformed Catholic or "High Church" of
      England. Though the queen was the acknowledged head of the church, they
      desired that her power to fill vacancies should be bestowed on the prime
      minister.
    
    
      [443]The
      Tories, on the other hand, supported the sovereign in her right to appoint
      church dignitaries, and were opposed to the so-called "Low Church" party.
      They were generally considered Jacobites, and would gladly have been such
      if the Prince of Wales had not been a Roman Catholic.
    
    
      Now that we have shown the distinction between these two parties, any
      future reference to them will be clearly understood.
    
    
      With Queen Anne fairly established on the throne, Lady Marlborough was at
      the very height of her glory, because she still retained unbounded
      influence over her majesty, and had a voice in every appointment. She even
      gave herself credit for many praiseworthy acts of the queen's, whether she
      deserved it or no. For example, she assured her friends that the command
      issued by the queen forbidding the sale of places in the royal household
      was really her own order, though it was probably no such thing. This was a
      French custom that had been introduced into England with the Restoration,
      whereby places were purchased of the former possessor without granting the
      sovereign any choice in the matter whatever. A man sold his position to
      the highest bidder, and felt not the slightest shame at pocketing the
      proceeds, nor was any privacy observed in the proceeding. It was a very
      injurious practice, and by no means insured good servants, so whether its
      abolition was due to the queen or Lady Marlborough, or both, it was
      certainly wise.
    
    
      Shortly after Queen Anne's accession her husband, Prince George, was
      attacked with asthma, which had such a bad effect on him that change of
      air was recommended, and their majesties started on a tour through the
      west of England. Bristol was one of their stopping-places, and while there
      Prince George started out one morning, [444] a
      name="link444" id="link444">incognito, with an officer for
      companion, to view the sights. After walking about for an hour or so, the
      prince went on the Exchange, and remained there until all the merchants
      had left excepting one John Duddlestone, a corset-maker. This good man
      stood off and stared at the prince, and then hesitatingly approached, and
      with a shy, awkward manner, asked: "Are you, sir, the husband of our Queen
      Anne, as folks say you are?"
    
    
      "Such is, indeed, the fact," replied the prince. "Then," continued John
      Duddlestone, "I have seen with great concern that none of the chief
      merchants on 'Change have invited your highness home; but it is not for
      want of love or loyalty: it is merely because they are afraid to presume
      to address so great a man. But I think that the shame to Bristol
      would be great indeed if the husband of her majesty the queen were
      obliged, for want of hospitality, to dine at an inn; I therefore beg your
      royal highness, humble though I am, to accompany me home to dinner and
      bring your soldier-officer along. I can offer your highness a good piece
      of roast beef, a plum-pudding, and some ale of my wife's own brewing, if
      that be good enough."
    
    
      Prince George was charmed with this original style of invitation, and
      accepted it with gratitude, though his dinner had been ordered at the
      White Lion. Arriving at his house in Corn street, worthy John Duddlestone
      called up from the foot of the stairs, "Wife, wife! put on a clean apron
      and come down, for the queen's husband and a soldier-gentleman have come
      to dine with us."
    
    
      Dame Duddlestone soon appeared in a clean, blue check apron, neat calico
      frock, and snowy cap, curtseying and smiling as she entered the room, her
      full face all aglow with the excitement occasioned by the honor of such
      visitors. Her table was soon arranged, and the prince did ample justice to
      the meal, well knowing that he could not
    
    
      [445]
    
    
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Original
    
    
      [447]please
      his host and hostess better than by eating heartily of what they set
      before him.
    
    
      "Do you ever go up to London?" he asked in the course of the dinner.
    
    
      "Oh, yes," answered the host; "I sometimes go there to buy whalebones for
      the corsets I manufacture."
    
    
      When the prince took his leave he gave John Duddlestone a card, and told
      him "the next time he went to London to take his wife along, and to be
      sure to bring her to court," adding "that if he would present that card at
      Windsor Castle it would insure his admission."
    
    
      Sure enough, when, a few weeks later, a supply of whalebone was needed,
      John actually took his good wife behind him on a pack-horse, and journeyed
      to London. Armed with the prince's card, he presented himself at Windsor
      Castle, was received by Prince George, and with his wife clinging to his
      arm, introduced into the presence of Queen Anne. Only a few words were
      necessary to recall to her majesty the circumstance Prince George had
      related on his return from Bristol. She cordially thanked the good-hearted
      couple for their hospitality to her husband, and, in return, invited them
      to dine with her, adding that the court-dresses which were required for
      the occasion, would be furnished by the officers of her household; but the
      visitors were required to choose their own material. Both selected purple
      velvet. The suits were accordingly made, and worn at the royal dinner
      party, when the queen presented the Duddlestone pair "as the most loyal
      persons in the whole city of Bristol."
    
    
      After dinner her majesty surprised John Duddlestone by requesting him to
      kneel down before her. He obeyed, when taking a sword and laying it gently
      on his head, she said: "Stand up, Sir John."
    
    
      Having knighted him, Queen Anne offered him a government  span
      class="pagenum">[448]position,
      or a sum of money, whichever he preferred, but he refused both, saying:
      "Wife and I want nothing, and we have fifty pounds of our savings out at
      interest, besides, judging from the number of people about your majesty's
      house, your expenses must be heavy enough." This honest reply pleased the
      queen so much that she presented the newly-constituted Lady Duddlestone
      with the gold watch that hung at her side. This mark of royal favor so
      delighted the good dame that whenever she appeared in the streets of her
      native town afterwards the watch was sure to be seen hanging from her blue
      apron-string.
    
    
      Although Queen Anne could not forget nor forgive the insulting remarks
      about herself that she had heard from the lips of Lady Marlborough, she
      did not find it easy to steel her heart against a woman whom she had loved
      for thirty years. There is no doubt that she had fully determined to part
      with both her and her husband, but meanwhile intended that the favorite
      should observe no change. The dearly-beloved "Mrs. Freeman" should have
      all the advantages her ambition and avarice had sought, and after both she
      and her husband had obtained all they desired of wealth and title they
      should be dismissed.
    
    
      The queen went to St. James's Palace in time to open parliament, leaving
      Lady Marlborough at Windsor, because she did not desire her attendance at
      the grand state visit to the city. But her majesty wrote "Dear Mrs.
      Freeman" in the most caressing terms, and in one of her letters she said:
      "It is very sad for your poor, unfortunate, faithful Morley to think that
      she has so very little in her power to show you how sensible she is of all
      Lord Marlborough's kindness, especially when he deserves all that a rich
      crown can give; but since there is nothing else at this time, I hope you
      will give me leave, as soon as he comes, to make him a duke."  span
      class="pagenum">[449]Lady
      Marlborough was not so pleased at this proposition as Queen Anne supposed
      she would be; the dukedom was all very fine, but no provision for the
      support of the title was mentioned, and the Marlboroughs were by no means
      rich. The letter dropped from the lady's hand as though she had read news
      of a death, but the lord was more grateful; for the new distinction
      increased the respect that the German princes in Flanders entertained for
      him, and, as he was commander-in-chief of the allied forces, it was
      important that he should be esteemed. He had not yet achieved the military
      glory that has made him one of the heroes of history.
    
    
      Some discussion had been going on between Lady Marlborough and the queen
      about the creating of four new peers, because the ministry had resolved
      that they should be Tories, and Lady Marlborough objected. At last, by way
      of compromise, the queen consented to add Mr. Hervey to the number; but,
      as he was a Whig, the newly-made nobles refused to have their names
      associated with his, and so the poor queen was in a dilemma. She wrote the
      haughty favorite a most humble letter, in which she said: "I cannot help
      being extremely concerned that you are so partial to the Whigs, because I
      would not have you and your poor, unfortunate, faithful Morley differ in
      opinion in the least thing."
    
    
      There was to be a grand dinner on Lord Mayor's day, which the Queen and
      Prince George were to attend, so for the encouragement of her Tory
      partizans, her majesty preferred that her favorite should not appear at
      her side on that occasion; she therefore concluded the letter we have
      referred to above, with this sentence: "Since you have staid so long at
      Windsor, I wish now for your own sake that you would stay until after Lord
      Mayor's day; for if you are in town you can't avoid going to the show, and
      [450]being
      in the country is a just excuse, and, I think, one would be glad of any
      way to avoid so troublesome a business. I am at this time in great haste,
      and therefore can say no more to my dear, dear Mrs. Freeman, but
      that I am most passionately hers."
    
    
      The queen had another reason for desiring Lady Marlborough's absence. It
      was this: The Duke of Ormond and Sir George Rooke had won a grand victory
      at Vigo, and so the Tory party were greatly elated. This enraged Lady
      Marlborough to such a degree that there was no telling how far she might
      go in giving expression to her displeasure, and she was safer at a little
      distance.
    
    
      Lord Marlborough returned from the continent in November, after having
      gained several victories and captured some towns in Flanders. The queen
      was so pleased with his success that she showed herself a little too eager
      to reward him; therefore when her majesty sent a message to the house of
      commons declaring her intention to create Lord Marlborough a duke, and
      requesting that a pension of five thousand pounds per annum might be
      secured to him and his heirs, it was regarded with disfavor. After some
      warm debate, it was decided "that Lord Marlborough's services, although
      considerable, had been sufficiently rewarded;" so, although the title was
      granted, the revenue was refused. The consequence was that Lady
      Marlborough hated the Tories worse than ever, although ten years before
      she had belonged to their party.
    
    
      With the hope of soothing the newly-made duchess, her majesty wrote: "I
      cannot be satisfied with myself without doing something towards making up
      what has been so maliciously hindered in parliament, and therefore, I
      desire, my dear Mrs. Freeman and her husband to be so kind as to accept of
      two thousand pounds a year out of my private purse instead of the five,
      and this can excite no envy, for nobody need know it."  span
      class="pagenum">[451]The angry
      duchess refused to be pacified, and rejected the queen's offer with scorn.
      But this was her regular plan of action to avoid appearing under
      obligations to her majesty; she always refused an offer the first time it
      was made, but never failed to claim it later. So it was in this case, for
      she not only pocketed the two thousand pounds per annum when she had
      charge of the queen's privy purse, but demanded, besides, portions for her
      daughters to the amount of thirty thousand pounds. Queen Anne fell
      completely in the power of the designing duchess, who constantly abused
      the Tories to her majesty, and accused her of being their accomplice. More
      than half of "the crowned slave's" time was spent in the degrading
      occupation of soothing the domestic tyrant, who exacted the most servile
      attentions, and complained, like a spoiled child, if she did not get
      everything she wanted, though this she generally managed, by hook or by
      crook.
    
    
      A.D. 1703. In the month of December the fleet of
      Charles of Austria, who was on his way to take possession of the throne of
      Spain, appeared off the west coast of England. The Duke of Somerset was
      immediately despatched to Portsmouth to receive the royal stranger, and
      conduct him to Windsor, where the queen had gone on purpose to entertain
      him. But he was first invited to rest while at the duke's residence on the
      coast of Petworth, and there he was met by the prince-consort, who had
      with great difficulty, and three or four upsets of his carriage, made the
      journey across the bad roads.
    
    
      The whole party arrived at Windsor at night, and were received by
      torchlight. Three noblemen awaited the King of Spain as he alighted from
      his coach, and the Earl of Jersey led him up the stairs, at the head of
      which he was met by Queen Anne, and conducted to her bed-chamber according
      to the etiquette of the times. An hour later a [452] a
      name="link452" id="link452">state supper was served, when the royal
      guest was placed at the queen's right hand, while Prince George sat on her
      left. At the conclusion of the feast a formal procession conducted King
      Charles to his sleeping apartment, where his own attendants awaited him.
    
    
      The next day Queen Anne returned the call of her guest, who, having been
      previously informed of her intention, met her at his drawing-room door
      with a profusion of compliments, protesting against the trouble-she took
      in coming to him. However, she was not to be outdone in politeness, so
      persisted in entering his room, where she spent about fifteen minutes.
      Then, at a signal from one of the courtiers, King Charles rose and
      conducted her majesty to a grand state dinner. During the progress of the
      meal the court was entertained by a vocal and instrumental concert. Dinner
      was served at three, and at its conclusion everybody played cards, basset
      being the favorite game, until supper was announced, which closed the
      hospitalities of the day.
    
    
      Her majesty had, during the interval between dinner and supper, presented
      several ladies of the highest rank to the king, and he had saluted each
      with a kiss, which was the privilege of his station. But a grand act of
      courtesy was reserved for the royal favorites, the Duke and the Duchess of
      Marlborough. To the former, King Charles presented his sword, saying at
      the same time, "that he had nothing worthier of his acceptance, for he was
      a poor prince, who had little more than his sword and his mantle." After
      supper he prevailed on the duchess to give him the napkin which it was her
      duty to present to the queen, and he held it while her majesty washed her
      hands. On returning it to the Duchess of Marlborough, the king placed a
      superb diamond ring on her finger. He then gave his hand to the queen, and
      led her to her bed- [453] a name="link453"
      id="link453">chamber, where he took formal leave, and expressed his
      intention to depart early the next morning. Prince George meant to escort
      the royal guest back to his ship at Portsmouth, but as he was far from
      well the Duke of Somerset was appointed to perform that office in his
      stead; and the Admiral, Sir George Rooke, was ordered to provide the
      proper number of ships to escort him to Spain.
    
    
      A.D. 1704. The queen's birthday this year fell
      on Sunday. She received the usual compliments, and held a splendid
      reception on the following day, after which Dry-den's play, entitled "All
      for Love, or Anthony and Cleopatra," was performed before her majesty and
      the whole court. This was succeeded on the next evening by the tragedy of
      Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, in honor of Prince George. There were various
      other entertainments during the week; and we must not omit to say that
      notices of them were given in the daily papers, of which there were
      several in this reign.
    
    
      So much dissension arose in parliament, chiefly on account of church
      matters, that some of the Tories became disgusted and withdrew from
      office. The most important of these were the queen's uncle, Lord
      Rochester, the Duke of Buckingham, and Lord Dartmouth. This gave the Whig
      party the upper hand, and the Duchess of Marlborough thoroughly controlled
      and led them. Prince George was a Whig at heart, though he managed to keep
      this fact secret; however, the duchess knew it perfectly well, and
      rejoiced at it.
    
    
      Now we must take a look at Queen Anne to see what sort of a ruler she
      made, for thus far we have touched lightly on this important matter, or
      given the Duchess of Marlborough the precedence. As far as personal
      affection goes, this queen was the most popular one who had occupied the
      English throne; the lower classes always [454] a
      name="link454" id="link454">called her "our good Queen Anne," and do
      so to this very day.
    
    
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Original
    
    
      It is to be accounted for in this way: In the first place, her parents
      were both English, and she herself was in every way like a middle-class
      Englishwoman, because of her very limited education. She was a comfortable
      sort of a matron, the last of the Stuarts, and by no means disposed to
      govern arbitrarily. Then she was, as we have seen, exceedingly generous to
      the church, and her reign witnessed a series-of continental victories. No
      wonder that the populace called her "good Queen Anne." Strange to say,
      although her majesty was never known to read a book, and passed a large
      part of her time at card-playing, poetry and science awakened into new
      life in her reign, and many of the writers delighted to sound her praises.
      She probably did not appreciate their work, but she patronized men of
      letters, it may be for love of approbation. [455] a
      name="link455" id="link455">The number of learned men of Queer. Anne's
      reign exceeded that of Elizabeth, and represented every branch of art,
      science, and literature. It included no Shakespeare, it is true; but there
      were Newton, Wren, Locke, Hogarth, Congreve, Colley, Cibber, Pope, Swift,
      Gay, Addison, Steele, and a host of others. We must not omit to mention
      Defoe, because every child will connect his name with that delightful
      romance, "Robinson Crusoe." It was on account of the existence of such a
      bevy of luminaries that Queen Anne's reign was entitled the Augustan age
      of England.
    
    
      That reign witnessed the beginning of periodical papers, for there were
      three, the "Tattler," "Spectator," and "Guardian," edited by Addison and
      Steele.
    
    
      The "Tattler" contained accounts of the political events of the day, and
      was placed on her majesty's breakfast-table, with the hope that she would
      occasionally read it, but she is not supposed ever to have done so. The
      "Ladies' Diary, or Women's Almanack" was another of the periodicals
      published in Queen Anne's reign, that have since become so numerous. It
      began by containing articles that are of most interest to women in
      general, but is now a mathematical periodical, which women are not likely
      to care for.
    
    
      We have mentioned the continental victories that distinguished this reign.
      The most splendid of them all was the battle of Blenheim, news of which
      was brought to Windsor Castle in August by Colonel Parkes, aid-de-camp to
      his grace, the Duke of Marlborough. This glorious victory was celebrated
      with unusual splendor.
    
    
      What shall we say of the hero of the great victory thus celebrated?
      Perhaps Thackeray has given the best description. He says: "Before the
      greatest obstacle or the most trival ceremony; before a hundred thousand
      men [456]drawn
      in battalia, or a peasant slaughtered at the door of his burning hovel;
      before a carouse of German lords, or a monarch's court, or a cottage table
      where his plans were laid, or an enemy's battery vomiting flame and death,
      and strewing corpses round about him,       he was always cold, calm,
      resolute, like fate. He performed a treason or a court-bow; he told a
      falsehood as black as Styx as easily as he paid a compliment or spoke
      about the weather. He was as calm at the mouth of the cannon as at the
      door of a drawing-room. He would cringe to a shoe-black or he would
      flatter a minister or a monarch; be haughty, be humble, threaten, repent,
      weep, grasp your hand or stab you whenever he saw occasion. But yet those
      of the army who knew him best, and had suffered most from him, admired him
      most of all, and had perfect confidence in him as the first captain of the
      world."
    
    
      After the Blenheim victory the enthusiasm for the duke was very great;
      even those who hated him and those whom he had cheated were ready to greet
      him with frantic cheers.
    
    
      The queen informed the house of commons that she desired to present the
      palace and grounds of Woodstock to the great hero and his heirs forever,
      and the act was passed a few weeks later. Her majesty ordered a portrait
      in miniature to be painted of the duke, which was sur-rounded by
      brilliants valued at eight thousand pounds, and the picture itself was
      covered with a diamond instead of glass. This magnificent gift was
      presented to the Duchess of Marlborough as a souvenir of the victory of
      Blenheim.
    
    
      It need scarcely be said that while her husband stood so high in the royal
      favor, the influence of the Duchess of Marlborough remained unabated, and
      she compelled the queen to appoint all her officers of government from the
      [457]Whig
      ranks. When her majesty hesitated, the upstart tyrant would vulgarly
      exclaim: "Lord, madam! it must be so!" Thus she secured for her
      friend, William Cowper, the high post of keeper of the Great Seal. The
      privilege of disposing of the church livings had belonged to the
      sovereign, but Lord Keeper Cowper now claimed it, and subsequently it was
      taken out of the hands of the crown entirely. The Church of England was
      never in greater danger of destruction than during Queen Anne's reign,
      because most of the dignitaries had been connected with some species of
      dissent. The prince consort was a Dissenter; but, worst of all, the
      violent duchess, her majesty's favorite and ruler, headed a strong band of
      free-thinkers, who hated the church.
    
    
      A.D. 1705. In April her majesty, accompanied by
      her husband, made an excursion to Cambridge. She was received by the Duke
      of Somerset, who was then chancellor of the university, and attended an
      exhibition, where she distributed honorary degrees among the noblemen and
      gentlemen of her court. But the most memorable of Queen Anne's actions
      connected with this visit was the bestowing of knighthood on Dr. Isaac
      Newton at Trinity College. After holding a grand reception, dining at
      Trinity Hall, and attending divine service at the beautiful chapel of
      King's College, the royal party returned to Newmarket, where her majesty
      made a long sojourn.
    
    
      A.D. 1706. Another great victory was won at
      Ramilies by the Duke of Marlborough, and another splendid thanksgiving
      procession took place at St. Paul's to celebrate it. At this period all
      the great offices of state were in the hands of the Marlborough family.
      The last of the appointments was the result of a serious contest between
      her majesty and the duchess, in which the latter came off victorious, as
      usual. This was the nomination of her son- [458] a
      name="link458" id="link458">in-law, Lord Sunderland, to the important
      office of secretary of state. When the queen yielded this point, the
      commander-in-chief and the lord treasurer were, one a son-in-law, the
      other father of a son-in-law of this ambitious couple. Their connections
      filled lucrative posts, besides, their daughters were ladies of the
      bed-chamber, and the mother herself, as mistress of the robes and groom of
      the stole, governed all the officials and the queen into the bargain.
      Never was this creature more insolent than when such was the state of
      affairs. She had contrived, by fair means or by foul, to appropriate the
      enormous income of ninety thousand pounds of the public funds, and the
      poor queen was miserable on account of what she had been made to suffer at
      the hands of the woman who was indebted to her for all she had, and for
      all she was. When she could no longer fail to perceive that the affection
      of her royal mistress had become estranged, the duchess began to inquire
      what new favorite had interposed to create ill feeling; for it was not in
      the nature of this woman to blame herself for anything.
    
    
      She could not fix upon any one until the regular season for the
      distribution of the queen's cast-off clothing came around; then Abigail
      Hill, her cousin, excited her suspicion. Although the duchess pretended to
      act with perfect justice in dividing the old gowns, mantles, and
      head-dresses among the bed-chamber women and dressers of her majesty, they
      all declared that she invariably kept the best of them for herself. Seeing
      that Abigail Hill fared badly in the distribution, the queen made her some
      liberal presents, as well as Mrs. Danvers, whose dismissal the jealous
      duchess had frequently urged. But this liberality only increased the
      squabble over the old clothes, and the duchess declared that they were all
      hers by right.
    
    
      Once when this Mrs. Danvers, one of the bed-chamber [459] a
      name="link459" id="link459">women, was so ill that she believed
      herself to be dying, she sent for the Duchess of Marlborough, and implored
      her to transfer her position with the queen to her daughter, who would be
      entirely unprotected after her death. The duchess declared her inability
      to do so, because of her being on bad terms with her majesty. Finding that
      to be the case, the sick woman told a long story about Abigail Hill's
      wickedness and general bad behavior, and wound up her narrative by
      informing her visitor that said Abigail had long been her secret enemy.
    
    
      Queen Anne may have been desirous of dispensing charities, but the Duchess
      of Marlborough held the purse-strings so tightly that she was unable to do
      so. When she demanded a small sum of money, that tyrant would frequently
      tell her that "it was not fit to squander away money while so heavy a war
      lasted," though at that very time vast sums of the public funds were
      annually supplied for the building of the duke's house at Woodstock. A
      touching case of distress came under her majesty's notice in the sad fate
      of Sir Andrew Foster, a gentleman who had spent most of his life in the
      service of James II., and who had been ruined by his adherence to that
      sovereign. He died of starvation, in a miserable hut just outside of
      London, and Queen Anne was so shocked when she heard it that she
      determined, as it was too late to relieve the unfortunate Jacobite, he
      should at least be decently buried. For this object she was forced to
      borrow twenty guineas of Lady Fretchville, for she could not command so
      large a sum herself; and yet the Marlboroughs were then drawing sixty-four
      thousand pounds per annum from the public purse. Later the sum reached
      ninety-four thousand pounds.
    
    
      A.D. 1707. The queen carried one extremely
      important point in violent opposition to the powerful duchess, and that
      was the union between Scotland and England. [460] a
      name="link460" id="link460">This measure was passed in both countries,
      signed and ratified in great state in the presence of the Scottish
      commissioners, the English ministers, and both houses of parliament. When
      Queen Anne signed this important ratification she said, "The union with
      Scotland is the happiness of my reign."
    
    
      On the same day, April 24, her majesty dissolved the English house of
      commons, and summoned the first united parliament of Great Britain to meet
      the following October. The signing of the union was then celebrated by a
      grand national festival, and a few days later her majesty went in solemn
      procession to St. Paul's Cathedral to return thanks for the successful
      completion of this matter.
    
    
      But it must not be supposed that the union was brought into working order
      without a struggle, for in the course of a few weeks Scotland was almost
      in a state of open rebellion. It was the queen's policy to extend mildness
      and mercy to all offenders, which was a great deal more effective than
      shedding blood on the scaffold; for in a very little while she was
      universally acknowledged as sovereign of both England and Scotland.
    
    
      Sixteen Scottish noblemen represented their country in parliament, and
      there was a good deal of jealousy aroused on account of favors shown them
      by her majesty. At her accession she had declared, "That her heart was
      entirely English," and this sentence was inscribed on some of her medals,
      so when she showed partiality to the Scotch an English satirist wrote:       
    
    
      
    
    
      "The queen has lately lost a part
    
    
      Of her 'entirely English heart,'
    
    
      For want of which by way of botch
    
    
      She pieced it up again with Scotch."
    
    
      
    
    
      For some reason, not necessary for us to inquire into, the Duke of
      Hamilton was denied a seat in parliament; [461] a
      name="link461" id="link461">and in order to console him for the
      injury, Queen Anne consented to stand godmother in person to his third
      son. She gave the child her own name, and from his infancy he was called
      "Lord Anne." Some years later Lord Anne Hamilton was celebrated as a
      valiant soldier.
    
    
      To return to the palace dissensions. The Duchess of Marlborough became at
      last furiously jealous of Abigail Hill, and probably opposed her marriage,
      otherwise it would not have been managed so secretly as it was. She was
      engaged to Samuel Masham, a page to the queen, and it seems a very
      undignified proceeding for her majesty to have consented to witness a
      secret marriage, in a remote part of her palace, between two people who
      were not under obligations of duty to any one unless it was herself. But
      such was really the arrangement, and only proves that all parties stood in
      mortal terror of the duchess's wrath. How long this union would have
      remained secret it is impossible to tell, had not the queen thought proper
      to dower the bride from her own private purse, and as soon as she demanded
      the sum she chose to present, of course the watchful duchess set to work
      to find out to what purpose it was to be put. She had began to suspect
      that there was a mystery, and it did not take her more than a week to
      ferret it out. No sooner were her spies set on the right track than they
      made another discovery that was forthwith reported to the duchess with an
      accuracy and assiduity worthy of a better cause. It was this: "That Mrs.
      Masham spent about two hours every day with the queen in private, while
      the prince, who was a confirmed invalid, took his afternoon nap."
    
    
      Now did the duchess see, at last, who had forestalled her in her devoted
      "Mrs. Morley's" good graces; she only awaited a favorable opportunity to
      unbottle the phials of her wrath, and pour them on the heads of both the
      offenders. [462]The
      enormity of the crime shocked her. "I was struck with astonishment at such
      an instance of ingratitude," she wrote her husband, "and should not have
      believed it had there been any room for doubt."
    
    
      In reply to her very exaggerated statement of a trivial affair, the duke
      wrote some good advice. His letter was sent from Meldest, in South
      Germany, and he said: "The wisest thing is to have to do with as few
      people as possible. If you are sure Mrs. Masham speaks of business to the
      queen, I should think you might, with some caution, tell her of it, which
      would do good, for she certainly must be grateful, and will mind what you
      say."
    
    
      The duchess did not heed this advice of her clear-headed husband, but kept
      herself up to a pitch of excitement at what she called the barbarity,
      ingratitude, and wickedness of the queen. She accused her, too, of
      intrigue, though why the conversations she held with one of her attendants
      at the bedside of her declining husband should be so called it is
      difficult to understand. Her majesty treated Abigail Masham with
      confidence and consideration, because she assisted in the care of the
      prince-consort, who suffered from fearful attacks of asthma, and it was
      this attendant's duty to sleep at night on a pallet in the ante-chamber of
      her majesty's bed-room, within call.
    
    
      Not long after the duchess discovered the marriage, when she was alone
      with the queen one day, she took her to task for having kept it secret,
      and told her that it plainly showed a change in her majesty's feeling
      towards her. The queen replied, "That it was not she who was
      changed, but the duchess," and added, "I believe I have begged Masham a
      hundred times to tell you of her marriage, but she would not."
    
    
      This confession convinced the angry duchess that she had been a subject of
      discussion, and she became more indignant [463] a
      name="link463" id="link463">than ever to think that so humble a person
      as her cousin Abigail should presume to speak with her majesty about so
      high and mighty a creature as herself. She determined to give the young
      woman a sound rating, but changed her mind, and wrote her an angry,
      undignified letter instead. But Sarah of Marlborough was not particularly
      well educated, and made as grave blunders as did her majesty in her
      attempts at letter-writing. Mrs. Masham, on the other hand, was a woman of
      talent, and wrote so well in reply as not only to astonish her
      correspondent, but to convince her that with the pen, at least, she was
      far her superior, and a person who could ably defend herself against any
      attack made on paper. Perhaps it would have been well had she explained
      the accident that caused the queen to overhear the duchess express her
      loathing and hatred of herself the day when she had put on the gloves by
      mistake. Abigail Masham might have written, "It was your shameful
      ingratitude, your offensive remarks, that changed her majesty's heart
      towards you;" but the secret was not hers, and there is no evidence of her
      having betrayed her royal mistress all the while she served her.
    
    
      The queen's unwise consent to witness the secret marriage between Abigail
      Hill and Samuel Masham was all the proof the Duchess of Marlborough needed
      that she had been supplanted in the royal favor, and from that moment
      whatever change she observed she laid at the door of her successor. Some
      one has very wisely said of Mrs. Masham's turning her back on the duchess:
      "She was her near relative, and the defect of base ingratitude seems to
      run in her family. The duchess should have chosen her watch-dog on the
      queen, when she became too grand or too indolent to perform that needful
      office, from a better breed." [464] a
      name="link464" id="link464">Previous to her majesty's removal to
      Windsor for the summer, a very odd circumstance occurred, which we will
      leave the duchess and her wrangling for awhile to relate. It is about
      Prince Matveof, ambassador of Peter the Great of Russia. Having been
      recalled to Russia, the prince attended the queen's levee for the purpose
      of taking formal leave of her. No sooner had he left the palace than he
      was arrested for debt on a writ of Mr. Morton, lace dealer of Covent
      Garden, and locked up in the bailiff's house. The noble Russian had fought
      desperately, without seeming to understand why he was seized, and wounded
      several of the bailiff's men quite seriously. The next day the bill of
      fifty pounds was paid, and the matter explained; but, as the prince had
      not had the slightest intention of defrauding the tradesman, he was justly
      indignant, and left England thoroughly disgusted. When he got home the
      czar resented the indignity offered to his ambassador by putting a stop to
      intercourse of trade, adding a threat of declaration of war. Queen Anne
      entered into an elaborate explanation, and assured the czar that the
      insult did not originate from any wrong intended by her or her ministers,
      but arose from the rudeness of a tradesman. But his Russian highness was
      by no means satisfied, so he wrote a very formidable document requesting
      "the high and mighty Princess Anne, Queen of Great Britain and Ireland, to
      return him, by bearer, the head of Morton, the lace dealer of Covent
      Garden, together with the heads and hands of any of his aids and abettors
      in the assault upon Prince Matveof that her majesty might have
      incarcerated in her dungeons and prisons."
    
    
      The queen was perfectly amazed at this demand for the heads and hands of
      her subjects, and requested her secretary "to assure the czar that she had
      not the disposal of [465] a name="link465"
      id="link465">any heads in her kingdom excepting those forfeited by the
      infraction of certain laws, which Mr. Morton and his assistants had not
      trespassed." The czar either could not, or would not, understand that
      Englishmen did not have their heads and hands chopped off at the caprice
      of the crown, and an angry correspondence was continued between the
      Russian and English governments for two years. At last a happy idea struck
      the queen, and she sent Mr. Whitworth, a gentleman who understood Russian
      customs, to say, "that although nothing had been acted against Prince
      Matveof but what the English law allowed, yet those laws were very bad and
      inhospitable ones, and that her majesty had had them repealed, so that his
      imperial highness's ambassadors could never again be subjected to such an
      injury."
    
    
      This was no compliment, but a fact; for from that incident laws were
      caused to be made that protected ambassadors and their suites from arrest,
      which are in force to the present day. Such laws were sadly needed during
      Queen Anne's reign to prevent scenes of violence; for ambassadors took
      precedence according to the supposed rank of the sovereigns they
      represented. This being the case, the representatives of France and Spain,
      the two countries that were always at war, had a regular fight, aided by
      their retinues, at all public processions; they even went so far as to cut
      the traces of each other's coaches, lest the line should be broken and one
      dash in before the other. It is needless to say that the London populace
      immensely enjoyed such contests, and the "roughs" invariably gathered
      where the "mounseers," as they called them, were most likely to begin the
      fight. Sometimes they were quite serious, and more than one man lost his
      life while combating for position.

      CHAPTER XIV.
    
    
      When her majesty
      opened parliament in the autumn she made the usual speech containing
      entreaties that goodwill and friendship might continue among all ranks of
      her subjects, but particularly with regard to the newly-made union. King
      William III. had said, "That he did not desire the experiment of a union
      with Scotland to be made in his reign, because he had not the good fortune
      to know what would satisfy a Scotchman." This would seem to apply equally
      to Queen Anne, for the Scotch were excessively dissatisfied and were
      already getting up petitions for dissolving the newly-made union, while
      the English turned up their noses at their northern neighbors, with whom
      they had no desire to be associated in parliament.
    
    
      Public affairs did not seem to occupy Queen Anne's attention more than
      private ones, for the duchess kept her in a constant state of worry with
      her threats and her ill-temper; and there was scarcely day when she did
      not feel the necessity for sending a letter of explanation and apology to
      the tyrant for some imaginary offence, or some omitted honor, either on
      her own part or that of Mrs. Masham. There was at this time a matter of
      private interest under consideration between her majesty and the duchess.
      The latter had long before asked for a part of St. James Park, on which to
      build a palace for herself, but as the demand was an unreasonable one, the
      queen was [467]less
      generous and compliant than she had been on previous occasions. But the
      duchess had set her heart on the very spot she had designated, and get it
      she would at any cost. So she importuned the poor queen, month after
      month, and made her displeasure so seriously felt on account of the
      refusal, that at last she gained her point, and the present Marlborough
      House marks the spot.
    
    
      The indignation of the London populace was justly aroused, because, when
      digging the foundation for her palace, the duchess had caused the removal
      of a fine oak tree which had sprung from an acorn that Charles II. had
      brought from Boscobel, and planted with his own hands in this pleasure
      garden of his queen, Catharine of Braganza.
    
    
      The Marlborough family were jealous of Robert Harley, ex-speaker of the
      house of commons; and when his secretary, William Gregg, was arrested
      because he was discovered in traitorous correspondence with the French,
      they tried very hard to implicate Harley, too, but did not succeed. The
      secretary was hanged, and there was a hue and cry, because it was said
      that Queen Anne had sent the prisoner some comforts by her physician,
      Arbuthnot; but when the matter came to be sifted, it was found that such
      was her majesty's custom, because she was always unwilling to sentence any
      one to death; and when obliged to do so tried to alleviate their
      sufferings while they were in prison as much as possible.
    
    
      A.D. 1708. Angry debates in the queen's cabinet
      council were of daily occurrence, and her presence was never a check on
      the coarseness and brutality of the officers. A scene of this sort took
      place one day when her majesty made an attempt to free herself from the
      chains of Marlborough and Lord Godolphin. She told her resolution to Mr.
      St. John, and sent a letter through him to the Duke of Marlborough, having
      first read it to him, and requested [468] a
      name="link468" id="link468">him to tell what she had done about town.
      This was obeyed without reserve; and at the next council meeting, when
      Harley delivered a paper to her majesty containing some accounts of the
      war, the duke and lord-treasurer, Godolphin, abruptly left the room,
      whereupon the Duke of Somerset rose and told the queen in a rude tone,
      "That if she suffered that fellow to treat of affairs of the war, without
      the advice of the general, he could not serve her."
    
    
      Of course her majesty was obliged to succumb to the storm she had brought
      about her head, and forthwith dismissed Harley. Then she was requested to
      get rid of Mrs. Masham, though the councillors did not make a direct
      attack on the bed-chamber woman for fear of ridicule. The Duchess of
      Marlborough demanded a private interview; but did not succeed in having
      her cousin dismissed, because her aid in nursing the prince-consort was so
      valuable that the queen strenuously refused to part with her. But the
      duchess was so friendly in her manners at this interview that she
      succeeded in exacting a solemn promise from "her dear Mrs. Morley" that if
      at any time it should become necessary for her to quit her service her
      places should be transferred to her daughters.
    
    
      Another singular scene was enacted in the council when the "Pretender"
      invaded Scotland, and Sir George Byng was sent to intercept his progress.
      It was urged that if the young prince should be taken, he should forfeit
      his life; thereupon the queen wept, and the council broke up in confusion.
    
    
      Although the "Pretender" was really captured, her majesty was spared the
      embarrassment of deciding as to his fate, for he was landed on French
      soil. Not so the Jacobites who were taken at the same time, for they were
      charged with high treason; and old Lord Griffin was condemned  span
      class="pagenum">[469]to
      execution. But he pined away, and at the expiration of eighteen months
      died in prison of old age; for the queen regularly respited him, until she
      was thus relieved of the pain of putting an end to the existence of one of
      her father's most faithful servants.
    
    
      During the summer the queen quarrelled with the Duke of Marlborough,
      because she desired to appoint colonels in the army, and he justly
      believed that he was more capable than she could possibly be of judging
      what, men had deserved promotion. The prime reason for this dispute was
      that Prince George had some favorites for whom he desired places, and the
      queen was anxious to gratify him; but the Duke of Marlborough was so angry
      that he wrote a very severe letter of reproof to his brother, George
      Churchill, who forthwith showed it to her majesty, and excited a great
      deal of displeasure.
    
    
      Meanwhile the duchess kept hammering at Abigail Ma-sham, until at last she
      got hold of a subject for attack. One of the court spies had taken pains
      to inform her that her cousin had grand apartments at Kensington Palace,
      where she received her friends in style whenever they called. After duly
      turning this piece of news over in her mind, the duchess came to the
      conclusion that the apartments referred to must be those that King William
      had fitted up for his favorite, Keppel, and that Queen Anne had
      subsequently allotted to her. To be sure, she had never occupied them, and
      probably never would do so; but she was determined that no one else should
      enjoy them, least of all Abigail Masham. So, in high dudgeon, she posted
      off to Kensington to inquire into the matter.
    
    
      Prince George was so ill from gout and asthma, and had grown so
      excessively fat, that he could not get up or down stairs without a great
      deal of suffering; therefore he was lodged on the ground-floor of the
      palace, whence he could [470] a name="link470"
      id="link470">walk out in the grounds and enjoy the air whenever he
      felt able. The queen shared his apartments, and as he often required care
      at night to prevent his suffocating during his paroxysms of coughing, the
      bed-chamber women were placed in the adjoining rooms, so they could be
      summoned in case of need.
    
    
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Original
    
    
      On arriving at the palace, the duchess ordered the housemaid to open her
      suite of apartments, and moved towards those on the ground-floor, although
      part of them were situated on the one above. The maid replied that she
      could not do so, because they were divided between Mrs. Masham and the
      bed-chamber women in waiting. That was just what the irate duchess had
      come to find out; so she immediately [471] a
      name="link471" id="link471">made an indignant complaint to the queen,
      which resulted, after too much absurd wrangling to be worthy of recital,
      in the removal of the royal household to a house in Windsor Forest, which
      her majesty had purchased in the days when she was forbidden by Queen Mary
      to appear at court. In this quiet retreat she watched over her sick
      husband and sought to relieve his sufferings; but the duchess declared
      that the reason Queen Anne spent the summer in that place, "which was as
      hot as an oven," was to enable Mrs. Masham to admit such persons as
      desired secret interviews with her majesty, and they could be let in from
      the park without anybody being the wiser.
    
    
      While at this cottage, the victory of Oudenarde was announced to her
      majesty. When she heard that it had been won at the cost of two thousand
      lives, she exclaimed: "O Lord! when will all this dreadful bloodshed
      cease?" Nevertheless, etiquette required her to write a letter of
      congratulation and thanks to the victorious Duke of Marlborough, which she
      did at once.
    
    
      Public thanksgiving for the victory took place in the usual way at St.
      Paul's Cathedral on the nineteenth of August. As her husband was the
      victor, the Duchess of Marlborough considered herself the heroine of the
      day, and bustled about to make herself as important as possible. Her
      office of mistress of the robes imposed upon her several duties, and among
      others, the arrangement of the queen's jewels as she chose to have them
      worn. When the royal cortège was approaching the cathedral, the duchess
      chanced to cast her eyes over the costume of her majesty, and observed
      that the jewels were absent. This was a mark of disrespect that she would
      not stand, so she began scolding in such way that the queen lost her
      temper, and the two ladies quarrelled and abused each other until they got
      inside the church, when the duchess angrily bade the [472] a
      name="link472" id="link472">queen "to hold her tongue." This was too
      much. Her majesty had borne a great deal from her friend, but such an
      insult aroused her indignation. Perhaps the duchess repented of her hasty
      speech; for a day or two later she took occasion to send the following
      humble note with a letter from her husband:       
    
    
      "I cannot help sending your majesty this letter to show how exactly Lord
      Marlborough agrees with me in opinion that he has now no interest with
      you, though when I said so in the church last Thursday you were pleased to
      say it was untrue."
    
    
      "And yet, I think he will be surprised to hear that when I had taken so
      much pains to put your jewels in a way that I thought you would like, Mrs.
      Masham could make you refuse to wear them in so unkind a manner; because
      that was a power she had not thought fit to exercise before.
    
    
      "I will make no reflections on it, only that I must needs observe that
      your majesty chose a very wrong day to mortify me when your were just
      going to return thanks for a victory obtained by my Lord Marlborough!"
    
    
      No doubt the queen thought, as anybody might, that a great deal of fuss
      had been made about a trifling matter, for she sent the following reply:       
    
    
      "After the commands you gave me on the thanksgiving day not to
      answer, I should not have troubled you with these lines; but, to return
      the Duke of Marlborough's letter safe into your hands, and for the same
      reason, I do not say anything to that or to yours which enclosed it."
    
    
      What a pity it is that the queen did not always behave with the same
      dignity, when dealing with the haughty, domineering duchess! If she had,
      many a heartache and many an insult she might have spared herself. Another
      letter, still more meek in its tone, was sent in reply; but  span
      class="pagenum">[473]open
      warfare had been declared between the friends of former years, and the
      duchess had no chance of ever regaining her sway over her sovereign's
      heart.
    
    
      Her husband's ill health was a matter of greater concern to Queen Anne
      just then than anything else could be; and, within a week after the stormy
      scene at St. Paul's, she set out with him for the west of England, hoping
      that change of air might benefit him. They travelled by easy stages until
      they arrived at Bath, a favorite resort, where Anne often went for her own
      health.
    
    
      That autumn a fine statue of the queen that had been modeled by Bird, the
      sculptor, was finished, and placed at the west door of St. Paul's, where
      it still stands. Although it is said to be a perfect likeness, it is
      considered by no means an excellent work of art, notwithstanding its
      having cost over five hundred pounds. Just when it was erected, there was
      a report current that the queen intended to free herself from the tyranny
      of the Duchess of Marlborough. That was enough to strike terror to the
      hearts of the Whigs; for with their ruler in disgrace, they could hope for
      no better fate than banishment,       at least from the public treasury,
      whence they were generously helping themselves. Their only chance then was
      to calumniate the queen and make her as unpopular as possible, so that
      when it came to the point their party would be too strong for her to
      resist. So they accused her of all sorts of vices in circulars that were
      daily distributed among the populace. One charge brought against her was
      that of intoxication, because one of her enemies had said "that she got
      drunk every day as a remedy to keep the gout from her stomach." Had this
      been a fact, the Duchess of Marlborough would certainly have been one of
      her first accusers, but even in her most malignant moods she never
      mentions such a fact. However, the Whig physician, Dr. Garth, wrote an
      epigram [474]which
      was found fastened to the statue the day after it appeared in front of St.
      Paul's Cathedral. It ran thus:       
    
    
      
    
    
      "Here mighty Anne's statue placed we find,
    
    
      Betwixt the daring passions of her mind;
    
    
      A brandy-shop before, a church behind:
    
    
      But why thy back turned to that sacred place,
    
    
      As thy unhappy father's was to grace?
    
    
      Why here, like Tantalus, in torments placed,
    
    
      To view those waters which thou canst not taste?
    
    
      Though, by thy proffer'd globe we may perceive,
    
    
      That for a dram, thou the whole world would'st give."
    
    
      
    
    
      It must be remembered that this was written by an enemy; very different is
      the poetry under an engraving of the queen and her consort at the British
      Museum, and forms a pleasing contrast to the above:       
    
    
      
    
    
      "The only married queen that ne'er knew strife,
    
    
      Controlling monarchs, but submissive wife,
    
    
      Like angels' sighs her downy passions move,
    
    
      Tenderly loving and attractive love.
    
    
      Of every grace and virtue she's possessed       
    
    
      Was mother, wife, and queen, and all the best"
    
    
      
    
    
      On her return from Bath the queen congratulated herself on her husband's
      improvement; but he knew that it was only momentary, and when she was
      preparing for a hunting excursion at Newmarket he begged her not to leave
      him. He felt that he had not long to live, and he was right, for he died
      before the close of the month, at Kensington Palace. Queen Anne had been a
      happy wife for twenty years, and the death of the prince-consort was a
      dreadful blow, though she had witnessed his declining health for many
      months. Even at the moment of her greatest bereavement, the Duchess of
      Marlborough forced herself into the presence of the queen, and insisted
      upon leading her from the room after the prince was dead. Anne treated her
      with excessive coldness, merely submitting to [475] a
      name="link475" id="link475">the arrangements she had made for her
      removal to St. James's Palace, because she was too miserable to oppose
      her.
    
    
      The interment of the prince-consort took place on the thirteenth of
      November. The funeral was private, which only means that it was performed
      by torchlight at night, for it was attended by all the ministers and great
      officers of state. The court went into mourning, and all the theatres were
      closed for a month.
    
    
      A.D. 1709. The duchess continued to watch Queen
      Anne very closely, and was shocked when fires were ordered to be made in
      the apartments occupied by the late prince-consort, also in those below,
      the two being connected by a private back staircase. They were for her
      majesty and Mrs. Masham, and strong suspicions were aroused in the mind of
      the active watch-dog that this arrangement was effected for the purpose of
      granting interviews with her political opponents. She, therefore, took the
      queen to task for such an irregular mode of proceeding, and raising her
      eyes and hands in holy horror, said: "I'm amazed!" But the queen made no
      reply, and probably no change in her plans just then, for she was so
      absorbed in grief that she took no interest in anything for many months.
      She was not sufficiently recovered in spirits to open parliament the
      following May, but she issued a general pardon, particularly to those who
      had been in correspondence with the Court of St. Germain, and it was
      confirmed. This was for the protection of Lord-treasurer Godolphin as well
      as herself, for she was always in mortal terror lest the Marlborough
      family should proclaim to the world the part she had played in the
      revolution. Therefore she dared not exasperate the duchess, nor could she
      remove her until the duke had accumulated wealth sufficient to render the
      stability of the government a matter of personal interest with him. The
      [476]duchess
      understood this perfectly, and made the queen feel her power, as we have
      seen.
    
    
      Another victory won by the Duke of Marlborough forced her majesty to
      reappear in public. This was Malplaquet; but twenty thousand British
      subjects had lost their lives on the battle-field, and Queen Anne joined
      the thanksgiving procession with a heavy heart, and with eyes red and
      swollen from weeping. She could not rejoice over a victory at such a
      sacrifice. The details of the war filled her with horror, and she longed
      to put an end to the dreadful slaughter; but the victorious duke's return
      gave her little encouragement in that respect, for he demanded of the
      queen "her patent to make him captain-general for life, because the war
      would not only last through their lives, but probably forever." Anne was
      perfectly amazed at this extraordinary speech, but dismissed the subject
      by answering: "That she would take time to consider it," and afterwards
      asked Lord-chancellor Cowper: "In what words would you draw a commission
      which is to render the Duke of Marlborough captain-general of my armies
      for life?"
    
    
      Lord Cowper stared as though he thought her majesty had taken leave of her
      senses, and then warmly expressed his disapproval of such a proceeding.
      "Well, talk to the Duke of Marlborough about it," replied the queen,
      without telling him that she had never intended to make the appointment.
      Cowper obeyed, and assured the duke "that he would never put the great
      seal of England to such a commission." The Duke of Argyle and several
      other noblemen were secretly brought to confer with the queen on this
      subject, and she asked what she should do if her refusal to appoint
      Marlborough captain-general for life should prompt him to make an attack
      on the crown. The Duke of Argyle replied: "Her majesty need not worry, for
      he would undertake, if ever she commanded it, to seize
    
    
      [477]
    
    
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Original
    
    
      [479]the
      Duke of Marlborough, at the head of his troops, and bring him before her,
      dead or alive!"
    
    
      It was Harley who brought this secret council together, and the
      Marlboroughs hated him worse than ever when they discovered it. They had
      gone a step too far, and the division in their own party in consequence
      caused the duke to withdraw his request.
    
    
      Her majesty having expressed her intention to lay aside her mourning at
      the Christmas festival, which was close at hand, intercourse became
      necessary between her and the duchess, who was mistress of the robes. This
      was a signal for the renewal of hostilities, beginning with lodgings and
      situations for chambermaids and other members of the royal household; for
      the tyrant duchess insisted on her right to make every appointment of that
      sort. Many severe letters passed between her and the queen on this
      subject, and it became necessary to inform her on one or two occasions
      that she had rather overstepped the mark when claiming "her rights." The
      storm was at its height when the duchess discovered that her majesty,
      without asking permission, had ordered a bottle of wine to be allowed
      daily to a sick laundress who had washed her laces for twenty years.
      Thereupon she raved like an angry fishwife, and her voice was raised to
      such a pitch that the footmen at the back-stairs heard every word she
      uttered. The queen, unable to contend with such a vixen, rose to leave the
      room; but the irate duchess whisked past her, slammed the door, posted her
      back against it, and informed her royal mistress "that she should
      hear her out, for that was the least favor she could do her for having set
      the crown on her head and kept it there." This tirade was kept up for
      nearly an hour; then Sarah of Marlborough finished by saying "that she did
      not care if she never saw her majesty again," and flounced out of the room
      as the queen calmly [480] a name="link480"
      id="link480">replied, "that she thought, indeed, the more seldom the
      better."
    
    
      It is hard to comprehend how a sovereign could submit to such humiliating
      scenes, but she knew that the chief cause of complaint with the duchess
      regarding the wine arose from the fact of the laundress having once served
      Mrs. Masham, who, it was supposed, was the instigator of the queen's
      beneficent act. Even then such petty jealousy, and such absurdly,
      undignified behavior give a poor opinion to the world of the lofty
      duchess's head and heart. She and the queen scarcely spoke after this; but
      a day or two before Christmas she wrote a letter to her majesty lecturing
      her on the necessity of entering on the religious services of the season
      with a spirit of meekness and forgiveness for injuries. Some passages were
      so insolent that the letter was not answered; but as the queen passed to
      the altar of St. James's Chapel, she bestowed a gracious smile on the
      writer.
    
    
      A.D. 1710. The new year opened with the queen at
      Hampton Court, considering the best means for breaking loose from the
      trammels of the Whig party, headed by the Marlborough family. It was a
      difficult step, but she was determined to take it, and for that purpose
      summoned Harley to her presence in the most secret manner possible. His
      advice was to begin by filling the post of lieutenant of the Tower, just
      vacated by the death of the Earl of Essex, as her majesty chose, without
      consulting anybody. In consequence, the Earl of Rivers was appointed to
      this great office, whereupon the duchess flew into a rage, and declared
      that a man who had borne the nickname of "Tyburn Dick" in his youth,
      having barely escaped conviction at the criminal bar for robbing his own
      father, was no fit person for such an honor. But this is how he had
      managed to obtain it: No sooner did he hear of the death

      Essex than he hastened to the presence of the Duke of Marlborough with the
      news, adding a request that the great man would interest himself with the
      queen to secure the vacant post for him. It was not the duke's way to give
      a decided refusal, nor did he hesitate to make promises that he had not
      the slightest intention of fulfilling; so, after complimenting "Tyburn
      Dick," and loading him with offers of kindness, the duke advised him to
      "think of something better than the lieutenancy of the Tower, as the place
      was not worthy of his talent." However, the man was determined, and said:
      "He was going to ask the queen for the appointment, and would tell her
      that his grace had no objection." Marlborough, who never dreamed that the
      queen would take an important step without consulting him, told Lord
      Rivers that "he might say so if he pleased;" whereupon the petitioner lost
      not a moment in seeking an audience of the queen, who, on hearing what
      Marlborough had said, with the adornments Lord Rivers chose to add, made
      the appointment at once. As the new lieutenant of the Tower passed out of
      the royal presence he made the duke, who was just entering, a most
      profound bow, and rubbed his hands with delight as he left the palace. But
      we know that the duke had not intended that Rivers should succeed Essex,
      and the object of his present visit to her majesty was to propose the Duke
      of Northumberland instead. He was amazed to find that he was too late, and
      made serious complaints to the queen, who asked him, "whether Earl Rivers
      had asserted what was not true." The duke could not say that he had, and
      so there was no redress; but, when her majesty followed up this
      appointment by one for colonel of a regiment, Lord Godolphin was as
      indignant as the duke himself, and she was forced to withdraw.
    
    
      Before departing for his campaign the Duke of Marlborough  span
      class="pagenum">[484]sought an
      interview with the queen, and requested that his wife might be permitted
      to remain in the country as much as possible, and that as soon as peace
      was made her resignation might be accepted in favor of her daughters. The
      queen granted the first part of the request with alacrity, delighted at
      the prospect of being relieved of the presence of her tyrant, but made no
      reply with regard to the daughter's, on whom she intended to bestow no
      favors whatever.
    
    
      Now a most important trial took place this year, that created intense
      excitement, and occupied the court for three entire weeks. It was that of
      Dr. Sacheverel, a representative of an ancient Norman family, who had been
      impeached, chiefly on charges connected with the church; but, as this
      affair is excessively dry and uninteresting, it is only necessary to
      mention it because of its bearing on the position of Queen Anne. Dr.
      Sacheverel belonged to her party, and she was so much interested in his
      trial that she sat to witness it every day in a curtained box at
      Westminster Hall. At the end of the contest the doctor was sentenced to
      suspend his preaching for three years, which was almost equivalent to
      acquittal. The lower classes showed clearly that they were for their "good
      Queen Anne," and that they were ready to rise in her defence against the
      Whig ministry whenever she should say the word. This feeling, which was so
      clearly manifested, encouraged the queen to take measures to free herself
      from the Marlboroughs and their party. The duchess made several attempts
      at private interviews, but was always repulsed, until she became convinced
      at last that Queen Anne would see her only at public receptions, or when
      official duties required it. The Marlborough family conclave were
      convinced that their days were numbered when the Tory Duke of Shrewsbury
      was made lord-chamberlain [485] a
      name="link485" id="link485">of the royal household in place of the
      Whig Marquis of Kent. This was followed up by the removal of Lord
      Sunderland from his office of secretary of state. This young man, as
      son-in-law of the Duchess of Marlborough, had heard her majesty spoken of
      with so much disrespect that he had on several occasions behaved most
      rudely, and he was removed for this reason, more than for any adherence to
      the Whig party.
    
    
      The colonel whom her majesty had desired to appoint when she met with such
      violent opposition was Jack Hill, brother to Mrs. Masham, her favorite
      bed-chamber woman. She made another attempt, and positively declared that
      she would not sign a single one of the Duke of Marlborough's numerous
      commissions until her will was obeyed in this matter. This was alarming,
      for the duke received payment for these commissions; so he gave in at once
      and signed Jack Hill's appointment without further parley. Queen Anne
      forthwith sent the new officer to make an attack on Quebec, as the
      conquest of Canada was deemed an important measure for the security of the
      British possessions in America. Much to the delight of the Marlborough
      party, Jack Hill's attempt was a failure.
    
    
      The duchess was so angry at the dismissal of her son-in-law that she sent
      a letter to her husband, which he was to copy and forward to her majesty
      as though it were expressive of his own wrath, but he tossed it into the
      fire. But the irrepressible duchess had it intimated to the queen through
      David Hamilton, one of the court physicians, "that if she persisted in
      ruining her party all her fond and friendly letters of former days should
      be published, and forwarded on lest 'dear Mrs. Morley' might have
      forgotten how high her opinion had been of Mrs. Freeman, at that date."
      The queen kept her own letter, and demanded all the rest,saying: "She was
      sure the duchess [486] a name="link486"
      id="link486">did not now value them." Not another one found its
      way to the queen, for they were weapons too powerful to be lightly parted
      with.
    
    
      The next dismissal was that of the queen's long-trusted lord-treasurer,
      Godolphin. Several of his friends expressed their concern at this move on
      the part of her majesty. She merely replied, "I am sorry for it, but could
      not help it," and then turned out Lord Rialton, another of the Marlborough
      sons-in-law. The office of lord-treasurer was placed in the hands of seven
      commissioners, with Mr. Harley at their head.
    
    
      The Duke of Marlborough wrote his wife that he had heard of an assassin
      being on his way from Vienna to England with designs against the queen's
      life, and requested that the utmost care might be taken lest he should
      gain access to the royal presence. Here was a chance for the duchess to
      ingratiate herself once more in the queen's favor; so she drove post haste
      to court, and with a most important air demanded admittance, "on a matter
      of life and death." Her majesty refused to see her, whereupon the duchess
      sent her husband's letter by a messenger. One of Queen Anne's
      peculiarities was indifference to personal danger, so without heeding the
      warning, she merely returned the duke's letter with a line, saying: "Just
      as I was coming down stairs I received yours, so could not return enclosed
      until I got back." This was the last written sentence that ever passed
      between the queen and the duchess.
    
    
      Many of the ancient nobility who had never approached the English court
      since the revolution paid their respects to Queen Anne as soon as she had
      rid herself of the Marl-boroughs. But the principal one of that party
      still remained, for nobody had the courage to approach the terrible
      creature with any but flattering news; so it was determined  span
      class="pagenum">[487]to await
      the return of the only person in the world who could manage her, and that
      was the duke himself.
    
    
      Meanwhile the daring woman, who retained her office in defiance of
      sovereign, prime minister, and all the other high officials, drove about
      town in her magnificent coach, and made visits to different members of her
      party for the purpose of calumniating the queen. She was not permitted to
      enter the royal presence, and kept the gold keys that really belonged to
      the new officials; but she boldly declared that her majesty would soon
      want new gowns, and then she would be compelled to come to her to give
      orders for them. But she was mistaken, for on the return of the duke in
      December there was to be an end of her influence with the queen in every
      particular. On his arrival in London the duke took a hack and drove direct
      to St. James's, where he had a private half hour's interview with the
      queen. In his peculiar plaintive tone of voice he lamented his connection
      with the Whigs, and told her majesty "that he was worn out with fatigue,
      age, and misfortunes," and added "that he was neither covetous nor
      ambitious,"       at which she could scarcely suppress a smile. At the
      close of the interview the queen requested him to tell his wife "that she
      wished back her gold keys as groom of the stole and mistress of the
      robes." The duke remonstrated, but the queen merely replied: "It was for
      her honor that the keys should be returned forthwith."
    
    
      The duke entreated that this matter might be delayed until after the
      peace, which must take place the ensuing summer, when he and his wife
      would retire together. The queen would not delay the return of the keys
      one week. The duke fell on his knees and begged for a respite of ten days;
      the queen compromised, and named three as the utmost limit. Two days later
      the duke again presented [488] a
      name="link488" id="link488">himself at St. James's on urgent business;
      but her majesty refused to speak with him, unless he had brought the gold
      keys. Thereupon he returned home to get them, when a stormy scene ensued,
      which ended by his wife throwing the key's at his head. When the queen
      received them from the duke's hands, she said, "she valued them more than
      if he had brought her the spoils of an enemy."
    
    
      A.D. 1711. Early in the following year Queen
      Anne divided between the Duchess of Somerset and Mrs. Ma-sham the offices
      formerly held by the Duchess of Marlborough, the former being made
      mistress of the robes and groom of the stole; the latter, keeper of the
      privy-purse. On the second of May Queen Anne's uncle, the Earl of
      Rochester, died suddenly of apoplexy.
    
    
      Although Anne was his own niece, the earl had never concealed from her his
      opinion that she had no right to the crown she wore; but he had consented
      to aid her in the government, and was, as we know, made president of the
      council. But he entertained to the last day of his life the hope that he
      should see the son of James II. restored to the throne, and was the means
      of causing several letters to pass between James Stuart, or the Chevalier
      de St. George, as he was then called, and the queen.
    
    
      The Duke of Buckingham succeeded Rochester; and, being a relation of the
      queen's, a most friendly feeling existed between them. Once, after
      reading a long letter presented by him from her brother, the Chevalier de
      St. George, in which he set forth his claim to the throne, Queen Anne
      turned to Buckingham, and asked: "How can I serve him, my lord? You well
      know that a papist cannot enjoy this crown in peace. Why has the example
      of my father no weight with his son? He prefers his religious errors to
      the throne of a great kingdom. He must thank himself, therefore, for his
      own exclusion. All would be easy if he would [489] a
      name="link489" id="link489">join the Church of England. Advise him to
      change his religion, my lord."
    
    
      Although Queen Anne spoke thus, she knew that her brother would not
      renounce Catholicism, and she had no intention of aiding him to the throne
      unless he did. She favored the succession of the Protestant house of
      Hanover; but the Princess Sophia, who was the heiress of that line, had
      emphatically declared that if the young prince and princess of the house
      of Stuart would become members of the Church of England, their claim
      should never be disputed, nor would it have been, as future events proved.
    
    
      Throughout the summer Queen Anne suffered so much from gout that she could
      scarcely stir from her bed, but she held her receptions all the same, and
      the crowd was often so great that only those nearest the bed could get
      sight of her. In the autumn she was better, and received ambassadors from
      France to negotiate for peace. One evening in October her majesty
      mentioned publicly at supper "that she had agreed to treat with France,
      and that she did not doubt but that in a little time she should be able to
      announce to her people that which she had long desired,       a general
      peace for Europe."
    
    
      But she had not yet secured peace at home, for matters took such a turn
      that the new ministry insisted on the removal of the Duchess of Somerset,
      and when her majesty returned to the palace from the parliament meeting
      she asked for the Duchess of Marlborough. One of the latter's friends
      rushed to her, without a moment's delay, and told her that if she would go
      to the queen then she might, with a few flattering words, overthrow her
      enemies, but she indignantly refused. The queen had new ground for
      complaint against the duchess when she took possession of her new palace,
      just completed in St. James's Park; for the apartments she left in the
      queen's palace were bereft of locks, [490] a
      name="link490" id="link490">bolts, mirrors, marble slabs, and
      pictures, and looked as though a destructive army had sacked them. The
      duke lamented the strange conduct of his wife when he got back, but
      declared "that there was no help for it, and a man must bear a good deal
      to lead a quiet life at home." But this confession did not prevent his
      dismissal from the army. He was succeeded by the Duke of Ormond, who was
      ordered not to gain victories, but to keep the British forces in a state
      of armed neutrality until peace was concluded.
    
    
      It was at this time that Mr. Masham was made a peer, because her majesty
      was urged to it by some of her ministers, but she said that she had never
      any intention of making Abigail a great lady, and feared that by so doing
      she had lost a useful servant. But Lady Masham promised to continue in the
      office of dresser to her majesty even though she was a peeress.
    
    
      A.D. 1712. Nothing had given the queen so much
      trouble since the death of the prince-consort as that of her beautiful
      sister, the Princess Louisa, which occurred suddenly at St. Germain. An
      account of this sad event is given in the story of Mary Beatrice of
      Modena.
    
    
      Anne was ill herself in the autumn from intermittent fever, from which she
      never entirely recovered.
    
    
      Dean Swift was anxious to become a bishop at this period, and applied for
      the see of Hereford, which Queen Anne was disposed to grant, because she
      had never heard of him as anything but a partisan of the church. But he
      and Lady Masham had been friends for a long time, and she had frequently
      warned him to destroy the witty, satirical, offensive articles he had
      shown her about her majesty, the Duchess of Somerset, and others. The
      queen knew nothing about these writings, but the Duchess of Somerset did,
      so she secured the aid of Dr. Sharpe, Arch- [491] a
      name="link491" id="link491">bishop of York, to prevent the
      appointment. When her majesty consulted the archbishop on the subject, he
      startled her with this question: "Ought not your sacred majesty to be
      first certain whether Dr. Swift is a Christian before he becomes a
      bishop?" The queen asked him what he could possibly mean, whereupon,
      having armed himself with "The Tale of a Tub," and other works of Swift,
      he handed them to her. She was amazed at what she read, and ashamed of the
      slanderous puns addressed to herself, for she had not suspected their
      existence. It is needless to add that Swift was not raised to the
      bishopric of England, but the following year he was appointed Dean of St.
      Patrick's in Ireland.
    
    
      A.D. 1713. The treaty of peace that Queen Anne
      had so long and so earnestly desired was at last signed at Utrecht, and
      the French ambassador, Duc d'Aumont, soon after arrived in London to
      confer with her majesty on this subject. He addressed the most flattering
      speeches to her, and presented her with the nine beautiful gray Flemish
      horses with which he had made his public entrance into the metropolis.
    
    
      Parliament met soon after; and the queen's speech, announcing peace, after
      eleven years of warfare, was anxiously awaited. But she was too ill with
      gout, which had affected different parts of her body, to be able to appear
      in the house of lords until the ninth of April, and then her voice was
      painfully weak from her long suffering. Her majesty offered Louis IV. the
      Order of the Garter in honor of the signing of the peace; but the most
      interesting event to us of the present day connected with it is that the
      great composer, Handel, wrote his magnificent Jubilate to celebrate it.
    
    
      As time went on the queen's health grew no better, and she was such an
      enormous eater that frequent attacks of [492] a
      name="link492" id="link492">gout were the result,       particularly
      as she had grown so corpulent from her other disease, dropsy, that she
      could take no exercise, and had to be lowered and raised from one floor to
      another in the palace by means of a chair worked with pulleys and ropes.
      She was in constant dread lest her brother should land in England, or
      George of Hanover present himself at court to claim his place as her
      successor. She, therefore, wrote two letters, one to Princess Sophia,
      Dowager Electress of Brunswick, the other to George Augustus, Duke of
      Cambridge, setting forth the danger of such a proceeding, and appealing to
      their honor. As we know, her fears were groundless in that direction; for
      the house of Hanover made no attempt to approach the shores of England,
      though there has been some dispute among historians as to their real
      intentions in this matter.
    
    
      A.D. 1714. Queen Anne paid the ballad writer,
      Tom D'Urfey, a fee of fifty pounds for a verse he repeated one day while
      she was at dessert, that happened to tickle her fancy. As it refers to the
      Hanover succession, it is worth repeating:       
    
    
      
    
    
      "The crown's far too weighty
    
    
      For shoulders of eighty;
    
    
      She could not sustain such a trophy.
    
    
      Her hand, too, already
    
    
      Has grown so unsteady
    
    
      She can't hold a sceptre;
    
    
      So Providence kept her
    
    
      Away       poor old Dowager Sophy!"
    
    
      
    
    
      Certainly D'Urfey did not earn his fifty pounds for the literary merit of
      the verse, but perhaps it was because it possessed so little that it
      pleased the queen. The Electress Sophia of Hanover, about whom it was
      written, died before the end of the year, at the age of eighty-four.
    
    
      Queen Anne witnessed several stormy scenes among [493] a
      name="link493" id="link493">her ministers towards the end of July that
      caused her intense suffering. After each one she would sink into a swoon
      from exhaustion, and frequently said to her physician, Dr. Arbuthnot, "I
      shall never survive it." The councillors showed little consideration for
      her presence, and continued their quarrels, regardless of her ill health,
      though they must have seen the cruel effect. On the evening of July 29,
      there was to be another council meeting, which the sick queen dreaded more
      than all the others. When the hour drew near, Mrs. Danvers, one of the
      oldest ladies of the royal household, entered the presence chamber of
      Kensington Palace, and to her great surprise, beheld the queen standing
      before the clock with her eyes intently fixed on the dial plate. As her
      majesty had not for several months been able to move without assistance,
      Mrs. Danvers's surprise is early understood. She crossed the large room,
      the deep silence of which was only broken by the ticking of the clock, and
      approaching the queen, asked, "whether her majesty saw anything unusual
      there in the clock?" Without answering, Queen Anne turned slowly and
      looked at the speaker, who was so terrified at the ghastly, troubled
      expression on her face that she screamed for help. The queen was carried
      to bed by the people who had hastened to the summons, and raved in
      delirium for many hours about "the Pretender."
    
    
      Doctor Arbuthnot passed the night at her bedside, with several other court
      physicians, and the invalid rallied; but the news of her condition spread
      like wild-fire all over London; and in the morning Dr. Mead, a Whig
      politician, was summoned. As soon as he had seen the royal invalid, he
      demanded that "those who were in favor of the Protestant succession should
      at once send a bulletin of her majesty's symptoms to the Elector of
      Hanover's physicians, who would soon say how long Queen Anne had to live:
      [494]but
      he staked his professional reputation that her majesty would be no more
      long before such intelligence should be received." It has always been
      supposed that the peaceable proclamation of George I. was due to this
      physician's boldness.
    
    
      But Queen Anne did not die quite as soon as Dr. Mead had predicted, which
      was within an hour, for she recovered consciousness and speech enough,
      after being bled a second time, to appoint the Duke of Shrewsbury prime
      minister.
    
    
      He approached her bed, and asked her, "if she knew to whom she gave the
      white wand?"       the insignia of office.
    
    
      "Yes," replied the queen, "to the Duke of Shrewsbury; for God's sake, use
      it for the good of my people." Shortly after her mind began to wander
      again, and she frequently exclaimed in a piteous tone: "Oh, my brother!       oh,
      my poor brother!"
    
    
      The privy council assembled at her bedside; but she never recovered
      consciousness sufficient to pray or to speak rationally, and they soon
      withdrew.
    
    
      To prevent a disturbance in the city, the lord-mayor was ordered to be
      particularly watchful; trained troops were held in readiness to act at a
      moment's warning, and an extra guard was placed at the Tower. The Jacobite
      party held a meeting, but decided, after a great deal of consideration,
      that they could do nothing towards proclaiming the Chevalier de St.
      George.
    
    
      Between seven and eight o'clock, on the morning of August 1, 1714, Queen
      Anne expired, in the fiftieth year of her age, and the thirteenth of her
      reign. She died as her predecessor, William III., had done, on Sunday, and
      George I. was proclaimed king the same day. It must have been a bitter
      trial to the Jacobites to behold the Duke of Marl-
    
    
      [495]
    
    
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Original
    
    
      borough, [497]who,
      after a voluntary exile, returned to London the Wednesday succeeding Queen
      Anne's death, and made a grand triumphal entry, attended by hundreds of
      gentlemen on horseback, some of the nobility in coaches, and the city
      militia; but they had the satisfaction of seeing his own splendid carriage
      break down by Temple-Bar.
    
    
      Queen Anne had done much good for her people, and no evil; and there never
      was a sovereign more deeply regretted. The Duchess of Marlborough wrote a
      most unjust, abusive description of her benefactress; but it is to be
      hoped our young readers will be able to form an estimate of her character
      for themselves.
    
    
      Her remains were deposited in the vault on the south side of Henry VIII.'s
      Chapel, in Westminster, where lie Charles II., William III., and Prince
      George of Denmark. There was only one place left in this vault, and as
      soon as it received the last of the Stuart sovereigns it was bricked up.
      No monument nor tablet marks the resting-place of "good Queen Anne,"
      though it seems as though the fondness of "the Bounty" deserved at least
      this trifling distinction from the Church of England.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
