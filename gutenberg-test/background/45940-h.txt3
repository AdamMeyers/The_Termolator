"Though some make slight of Libels, yet you may see
by them how the wind sits: As, take a straw and throw
it up into the air, you may see by that which way the
wind is, which you shall not do by casting up a stone.
More solid things do not shew the complexion of the
times so well as Ballads and Libels."&mdash;Selden's Table-Talk.

[Pg 3]








I.

RICHARD OF ALMAIGNE,



  

"A ballad made by one of the adherents to
Simon de Montfort, Earl of Leicester, soon after
the battle of Lewes, which was fought May 14,
1264,"

&mdash;affords a curious specimen of ancient satire,
and shews that the liberty, assumed by the good
people of this realm, of abusing their kings and
princes at pleasure, is a privilege of very long standing.

To render this antique libel intelligible, the reader is to understand
that just before the battle of Lewes, which proved so fatal to
the interests of Henry III., the barons had offered his brother
Richard, King of the Romans, 30,000l. to procure a peace upon
such terms, as would have divested Henry of all his regal power,
and therefore the treaty proved abortive. The consequences of
that battle are well-known: the king, prince Edward his son, his
brother Richard, and many of his friends, fell into the hands of
their enemies: while two great barons of the king's party, John,
Earl of Warren, and Hugh Bigot, the king's justiciary, had been
glad to escape into France.

In the first stanza the aforesaid sum of thirty thousand pounds
is alluded to, but with the usual misrepresentation of party malevolence,
is asserted to have been the exorbitant demand of the
king's brother.

With regard to the second stanza the reader is to note that
Richard, along with the earldom of Cornwall, had the honours of
Walingford and Eyre confirmed to him on his marriage with
Sanchia, daughter of the Count of Provence, in 1243. Windsor
Castle was the chief fortress belonging to the king, and had been[Pg 4]
garrisoned by foreigners: a circumstance which furnishes out the
burthen of each stanza.

The third stanza alludes to a remarkable circumstance which
happened on the day of the battle of Lewes. After the battle was
lost, Richard, king of the Romans, took refuge in a windmill,
which he barricaded, and maintained for some time against the
barons, but in the evening was obliged to surrender. See a very
full account of this in the Chronicle of Mailros, Oxon. 1684, p.
229.[1]

The fourth stanza is of obvious interpretation: Richard, who
had been elected king of the Romans in 1256, and had afterwards
gone over to take possession of his dignity, was in the year 1259
about to return into England, when the barons raised a popular
clamour, that he was bringing with him foreigners to over-run the
kingdom: upon which he was forced to dismiss almost all his followers,
otherwise the barons would have opposed his landing.

In the fifth stanza the writer regrets the escape of the Earl of
Warren, and in the sixth and seventh stanzas insinuates that if he
and Sir Hugh Bigot once fell into the hands of their adversaries,
they should never more return home; a circumstance which fixes
the date of this ballad, for, in the year 1265, both these noblemen
landed in South Wales, and the royal party soon after gained the
ascendant. See Holinshed, Rapin, &amp;c.

The following is copied from a very ancient MS. in the British
Museum. (Hart. MSS. 2253, fol. 58 v&deg;.) This MS. is judged,
from the peculiarities of the writing, to be not later than the time
of Richard II.; th being everywhere expressed by the character &thorn;;
the y is pointed after the Saxon manner, and the i hath an oblique
stroke over it.





[The date of the MS. in which this ballad occurs is usually
placed at an earlier period than that fixed upon by Percy. Mr.
Thomas Wright, who prints it in his volume of Political Songs of
England (Camden Society), with several other poems in French,
Anglo-Norman, and Latin, on Simon de Montfort and the Barons'
Wars, assigns it to the reign of Edward II. It will be seen from
Percy's note to verse 44, that the last stanza was printed for the
first time in the fourth edition of the Reliques. This is explained
by the fact that these lines are written on a new folio of the MS.,
and must therefore have been overlooked by the original copyist.

This little poem is without rival as an early exhibition of English
popular feeling in the vernacular; and it also stands alone as
the first dated English historical ballad in existence. It was probably
[Pg 5]written during the first flush of enthusiasm after the memorable
battle of Lewes, because, before a year had gone by, victory had
passed to the other side, and at the battle of Evesham, fought on
the 4th of August, 1265, Simon, his eldest son Henry, and a host
of distinguished men, fell on the fatal field. As Drayton sang:


"Great Lester here expired with Henry his brave sonne,
When many a high exploit they in that day had done."




Prince Edward, who had passed his boyhood in Henry's company
and was much attached to him, personally attended his
funeral.

Richard, Earl of Cornwall, brother of Henry III., was elected
King of the Romans on the 13th of January, 1256-7, at Frankfort,
and is styled in Latin documents Rex Alemanni&aelig;. In earlier times
Richard had been a leader of malecontents, and "all from the
child to the old man heaped frequent blessings upon him," but
Montfort (then a courtier) gained him over to the King's side, and
the insurgents were in consequence dispersed.

Richard was probably not so base a man as the writer of the
ballad would wish us to believe, and a good action is recorded of
him which was very ill returned. He interceded for the life of De
Montfort's second son Simon, when that youth surrendered to the
royal party at Northampton in 1266, and he was successful in his
suit. In 1271, Simon and his brother Guy assassinated Henry,
Richard's son, then in the suite of Philip of France, on his return
from the Holy Land, while he was at mass in the church of St.
Lawrence, at Viterbo. Richard himself died in this same year at
Berkhampstead, and his estates descended to his son Edmond,
Earl of Cornwall.

The uncertain manner in which biographic honours are apportioned
is noteworthy, and a writer in the Quarterly Review (vol.
cxix. p. 26) very justly points out a deficiency in English literature,
when he writes that Simon de Montfort V., second Earl of
Leicester, "the founder of the English House of Commons, has
had no biographer."[2] Mr. Freeman, however, promises to do full
honour to his memory in a forthcoming volume of his history.

This is not the place to give any detailed account of De Montfort,
but a few words on the great leader may be allowable, more
particularly as Percy's introduction does injustice to the anti-royalist
party.

Simon de Montfort, fourth son of Simon de Montfort IV., fourth
[Pg 6]Comte de Montfort,[3] married Eleanor, Countess of Pembroke,
the daughter of King John. She had made a vow of widowhood,
and although her brother Henry III. gave her away when she was
married, by one of the royal chaplains, in the king's private
chapel at Westminster, 6th January, 1238, Edmund, Archbishop of
Canterbury, remonstrated strongly against the marriage. It is
said that when the prelate left England, he stood on a hill which
commanded a view of London, and, extending his hands towards
the city, pronounced a parting blessing on his country, and a curse
on the countess and the offspring of her unholy union.

Events so came about that the courtier and alien became the
representative leader of Englishmen, with the famous war-cry of
"England for the English." The battle of Lewes placed everything
in the power of Simon de Montfort, but in his prosperity
many of his followers fell away from him. The last scene of the
great man's life is truly pathetic. He lay at Evesham awaiting the
troops which his son was to bring from Kenilworth. He did not
know, however, that the garrison of that town had been surprised
by Prince Edward, who had escaped from confinement. The army
that marched upon Evesham bore the banners of Simon's son,
but they were flying in the van of an enemy. Simon's first words,
when he saw the force approach, were those of soldierly pride:
"By the arm of St. James they come on well; they learnt that
order from me." Before he spoke again, however, he had realized
his position, and he cried out: "May God have mercy on our
souls, for our bodies are Prince Edward's." When he died liberty
seemed to have been crushed out of existence, but it was not so,
for his spirit lived though his body died, and the real victory was
with him.

The fate of Simon de Montfort was a subject of general lamentation,
but none of the songs upon it that have come down to us
are in English. In an Anglo-Norman lament he is likened to
Thomas of Canterbury, and described as "a precious flower."
Priest and layman united in his praise, and he was revered as a
saint and martyr. Prayers were said in his honour, and a hymn
was sung at his shrine, beginning:


"Salve Symon Montis-Fortis
Totius flos militi&aelig;
Duras p&oelig;nas passus mortis,
Protector gentis Angli&aelig;."




Miracles were supposed to be worked by the power of his name,[4]
[Pg 7]and the character of these miracles may be judged by the
following samples. The "old Countess of Gloucester" had a
palfrey, which was asthmatic for two years, until one day in journeying
from Tewkesbury to Evesham, it drank from the earl's well
and was restored to perfect health. The next instance of miraculous
healing is still more remarkable. A chick, which belonged
to Agnes of Selgrave, fell into a pond and was drowned. Its mistress
pulled it out and commended it to "blessed Simon," whereupon
it got up and walked as usual.

Simon had six children by his wife Eleanor, viz., Henry, Simon,
Guy, Amauri, Richard, and Eleanor. Henry was slain with his
father, but the countess and the other children escaped out of
England. Simon and Guy went to Tuscany; Amauri accompanied
his mother to France, was taken prisoner in 1276, and kept in
confinement by Edward for a time, but set at liberty in 1280;
Richard went to Bigorre, but nothing certain is known of his after
career, and it is said that he settled in England under the assumed
name of Wellysborne, an assertion founded on two or three deeds
of doubtful authenticity.[5] Eleanor was married to Llewellyn,
Prince of Wales, in 1279, Edward I. paying all the expenses of the
ceremony, which was performed with great pomp.]

&#8258; This ballad will rise in its importance with the reader,
when he finds that it is even believed to have occasioned a law
in our statute book, viz. "Against slanderous reports or tales, to
cause discord betwixt king and people." (Westm. Primer, c. 34,
anno 3 Edw. I.) That it had this effect is the opinion of an eminent
[Pg 10]writer [the Hon. Daines Barrington], see Observations
upon the Statutes, &amp;c. 4to. 2nd edit. 1766, p. 71.

However, in the Harl. Collection may be found other satirical
and defamatory rhymes of the same age, that might have their
share in contributing to this first law against libels.

II.

ON THE DEATH OF K. EDWARD
THE FIRST.



  

We have here an early attempt at elegy. Edward I.
died July 7, 1307, in the 35th year of his reign, and
69th of his age. This poem appears to have been
composed soon after his death. According to the
modes of thinking peculiar to those times, the writer dwells more
upon his devotion than his skill in government, and pays less
attention to the martial and political abilities of this great monarch,
in which he had no equal, than to some little weaknesses of superstition,
which he had in common with all his contemporaries. The
king had in the decline of life vowed an expedition to the Holy
Land, but finding his end approach, he dedicated the sum of
&pound;32,000 to the maintenance of a large body of knights (140 say
historians, eighty says our poet), who were to carry his heart with
them into Palestine. This dying command of the king was never
performed. Our poet, with the honest prejudices of an Englishman,
attributes this failure to the advice of the king of France,
whose daughter Isabel, the young monarch, who succeeded, immediately
married. But the truth is, Edward and his destructive
favourite, Piers Gaveston, spent the money upon their pleasures.
To do the greater honour to the memory of his heroe, our poet
puts his eloge in the mouth of the Pope, with the same poetic
licence as a more modern bard would have introduced Britannia
or the Genius of Europe pouring forth his praises.

This antique elegy is extracted from the same MS. volume as
the preceding article; is found with the same peculiarities of
writing and orthography; and tho' written at near the distance of
half a century contains little or no variation of idiom: whereas the
next following poem by Chaucer, which was probably written not
more than fifty or sixty years after this, exhibits almost a new[Pg 11]
language. This seems to countenance the opinion of some antiquaries,
that this great poet made considerable innovations in his
mother tongue, and introduced many terms, and new modes of
speech from other languages.





[When Henry III. died, highly laudatory songs were sung in
honour of the new king, but when Edward I. died the people
were too grieved at their loss to sing the praise of his successor.
The present song is printed by Mr. Thomas Wright in his Political
Songs of England (Camden Society, 1839, p. 246), where he also
prints a French version, and points out that the one is clearly
translated from the other, adding that the French song was probably
the original. In verse 27, Percy printed hue (i.e. she) with
a capital H, under the impression that it was "the name of the
person who was to preside over the business."]

III.

AN ORIGINAL BALLAD BY CHAUCER.



  

This little sonnet, which hath escaped all the editors of
Chaucer's works, is now printed for the first time from
an ancient MS. in the Pepysian Library, that contains
many other poems of its venerable author. The versification
is of that species, which the French call rondeau, very
naturally Englished by our honest countrymen round O. Tho' so
[Pg 15]early adopted by them, our ancestors had not the honour of
inventing it: Chaucer picked it up, along with other better things,
among the neighbouring nations. A fondness for laborious trifles
hath always prevailed in the dark ages of literature. The Greek
poets have had their wings and axes: the great father of English
poesy may therefore be pardoned one poor solitary rondeau.&mdash;Geofrey
Chaucer died Oct. 25, 1400.





[These verses are printed in Morris's Aldine Edition of Chaucer
(vol. vi. pp. 304-5), but there is no conclusive evidence that they
are really by Chaucer. Mr. Furnivall writes (Trial Forewords,
Chaucer Society, 1871, p. 32):&mdash;"With the Pity I should like
much to class the Roundel ... as one of the poet's genuine
works, though it is not assigned to him (so far as I know), by any
MS. of authority. It exactly suits the Compleynte of Pite; there
is nothing in it (so far as I can see), to make it not Chaucer's, and
it is of the same form as his Roundel in the Parliament of Foules."
Mr. Hales suggests to me that the poem may have been written by
one of Chaucer's followers, and refers to verse 260 of the Knight's
Tale:


"The freissche beaut&eacute; sleeth me sodeynly,"




as having probably given the hint to the writer of this rondeau.]



I. 1.



  



Youre two eyn will sle me sodenly,
I may the beaute of them not sustene,
So wendeth it thorowout my herte kene.


2.



And but your words will helen hastely
My hertis wound, while that it is grene,
Youre two eyn will sle me sodenly.


3.



Upon my trouth I sey yow feithfully,
That ye ben of my liffe and deth the quene;
For with my deth the trouth shal be sene.
Youre two eyn, &amp;c.

[Pg 16]
II. 1.



So hath youre beauty fro your herte chased
Pitee, that me n' availeth not to pleyn;[94]
For daunger halt[95] your mercy in his cheyne.


2.



Giltless my deth thus have ye purchased;
I sey yow soth,[96] me nedeth not to fayn:
So hath your beaute fro your herte chased.


3.



Alas, that nature hath in yow compassed
So grete beaute, that no man may atteyn
To mercy, though he sterve for the peyn.
So hath youre beaute, &amp;c.


III. 1.



Syn I fro love escaped am so fat,
I nere thinke to ben in his prison lene;
Syn I am fre, I counte hym not a bene.[97]


2.



He may answere, and sey this and that,
I do no fors,[98] I speak ryght as I mene;
Syn I fro love escaped am so fat.


3.



Love hath my name i-strike out of his sclat,
And he is strike out of my bokes clene:
For ever mo 'ther'[99] is non other mene.
Syn I fro love escaped, &amp;c.

IV.

THE TURNAMENT OF TOTTENHAM:


Or, the Wooeing, Winning, and Wedding of
Tibbe, the Reev's Daughter there.



  

It does honour to the good sense of this nation, that
while all Europe was captivated with the bewitching
charms of chivalry and romance, two of our writers in
the rudest times could see thro' the false glare that
surrounded them, and discover whatever was absurd in them both.
Chaucer wrote his Rhyme of Sir Thopas in ridicule of the latter;
and in the following poem we have a humorous burlesque of the
former. Without pretending to decide, whether the institution of
chivalry was upon the whole useful or pernicious in the rude ages,
a question that has lately employed many good writers,[100] it evidently
encouraged a vindictive spirit, and gave such force to the
custom of duelling, that there is little hope of its being abolished.
This, together with the fatal consequences which often attended
the diversion of the turnament, was sufficient to render it obnoxious
to the graver part of mankind. Accordingly the Church
early denounced its censures against it, and the State was often
prevailed on to attempt its suppression. But fashion and opinion
are superior to authority: and the proclamations against tilting
were as little regarded in those times, as the laws against duelling
are in these. This did not escape the discernment of our poet,
who easily perceived that inveterate opinions must be attacked by
other weapons, besides proclamations and censures: he accordingly
made use of the keen one of ridicule. With this view he has
here introduced, with admirable humour, a parcel of clowns,
imitating all the solemnities of the tourney. Here we have the
regular challenge&mdash;the appointed day&mdash;the lady for the prize&mdash;the
formal preparations&mdash;the display of armour&mdash;the scucheons and
devices&mdash;the oaths taken on entering the lists&mdash;the various
[Pg 18]accidents of the encounter&mdash;the victor leading off the prize&mdash;and the
magnificent feasting&mdash;with all the other solemn fopperies that
usually attended the pompous turnament. And how acutely the
sharpness of the author's humour must have been felt in those
days, we may learn from what we can perceive of its keenness
now, when time has so much blunted the edge of his ridicule.

The Turnament of Tottenham was first printed from an ancient
MS. in 1631, 4to., by the Rev. William Bedwell, rector of Tottenham,
who was one of the translators of the Bible. He tells us, it
was written by Gilbert Pilkington, thought to have been some time
parson of the same parish, and author of another piece, intitled,
Passio Domini Jesu Christi. Bedwell, who was eminently skilled
in the Oriental and other languages, appears to have been but little
conversant with the ancient writers in his own, and he so little
entered into the spirit of the poem he was publishing, that he
contends for its being a serious narrative of a real event, and
thinks it must have been written before the time of Edward III.
because turnaments were prohibited in that reign. "I do verily
beleeve," says he, "that this turnament was acted before this proclamation
of K. Edward. For how durst any to attempt to do
that, although in sport, which was so straightly forbidden, both by
the civill and ecclesiasticall power? For although they fought not
with lances, yet, as our authour sayth, 'It was no childrens game.'
And what would have become of him, thinke you, which should
have slayne another in this manner of jeasting? Would he not,
trow you, have been hang'd for it in earnest? yea, and have bene
buried like a dogge?" It is, however, well known that turnaments
were in use down to the reign of Elizabeth.

In the first editions of this work, Bedwell's copy was reprinted
here, with some few conjectural emendations; but as Bedwell
seemed to have reduced the orthography at least, if not the phraseology,
to the standard of his own time, it was with great pleasure
that the Editor was informed of an ancient MS. copy preserved in
the Museum (Harl. MSS. 5396), which appeared to have been
transcribed in the reign of K. Hen. VI. about 1456. This obliging
information the Editor owed to the friendship of Tho. Tyrwhitt,
Esq., and he has chiefly followed that more authentic transcript,
improved however by some readings from Bedwell's book.





[A writer in the Gentleman's Magazine (July, 1794, p. 613),
calls attention to the fact that this ballad is "a burlesque upon the
feudal custom of marrying an heiress to the knight who should
vanquish all his opponents at a solemn assembly holden for the
purpose."

Bedwell's MS. is now in the Cambridge public library (Ff. 5,
48), and Mr. Thomas Wright, who has printed it in a miniature[Pg 19]
volume, believes it to have been written as early as the reign of
Edward II.

Bedwell was chaplain to Sir Henry Wotton in his embassy to
Venice, where he is said to have assisted the celebrated Father
Paul in the composition of his History of the Council of Trent.
The following is a copy of the inscription on Bedwell's monument
in the chancel of Tottenham church:&mdash;"Here lyes interred in this
chancel Mr. William Bedwell, sometime vicar of this church and
one of King James's translators of the Bible, and for the Easterne
tongues as learned a man as most lived in these moderne times.
Aged 70. Dyed May the 5th, 1632."]

Were best worthye
To wed hur to hys fere.[114]

Upstyrt thos gadelyngys[115] wyth ther lang staves,
And sayd, Randol the refe, lo! thys lad raves;
Boldely amang us thy doyter he craves;                              30
We er rycher men then he, and mor gode haves
Of cattell and corn;
Then sayd Perkyn, To Tybbe I have hyyt[116]
That I schal be alway redy in my ryyt,
If that it schuld be thys day sevenyyt,                         35
Or elles yet to morn.[117]

Then sayd Randolfe the refe, Ever be he waryd,[118]
That about thys carpyng lenger wold be taryd:
I wold not my doyter, that scho[119] were miscaryd,
But at hur most worschip I wold scho were maryd,                    40
Therfor a Turnament schal begynne
Thys day sevenyyt,&mdash;
Wyth a flayl for to fyyt:
And 'he,' that is most of myght
Schal brouke hur wyth wynne.[120]                             45
[Pg 21]
Whoso berys[121] hym best in the turnament,
Hym schal be granted the gre[122] be the comon assent,
For to wynne my doyter wyth 'dughtynesse' of dent,[123][124]
And 'coppell' my brode-henne 'that' was broyt out of Kent:[125]
And my dunnyd kowe                                              50
For no spens[126] wyl I spare,
For no cattell wyl I care,
He schal have my gray mare,
And my spottyd sowe.

Ther was many 'a' bold lad ther bodyes to bede:[127]                55
Than thay toke thayr leve, and homward they yede;[128]
And all the weke afterward graythed ther wede,[129][130]
Tyll it come to the day, that thay suld do ther dede.
They armed ham[131] in matts;
Thay set on ther nollys,[132]                               60
For to kepe ther pollys,[133]
Gode blake bollys,[134]
For batryng of bats.[135]

Thay sowed tham in schepeskynnes, for thay schuld not brest:[136]
Ilk-on[137] toke a blak hat, insted of a crest:                     65
'A basket or a panyer before on ther brest,'[138]
And a flayle in ther hande; for to fyght prest,[139]
Furth gon thay fare:[140]
Ther was kyd[141] mekyl fors,[142]
Who schuld best fend hys cors:[143]                         70
He that had no gode hors,
He gat hym a mare.[144]
[Pg 22]
Sych another gadryng[145] have I not sene oft,
When all the gret company com rydand to the croft:[146]
Tyb on a gray mare was set up on loft                               75
On a sek ful of fedyrs,[147] for scho schuld syt soft,[148]
And led 'till the gap.'[149]
For cryeng of the men
Forther wold not Tyb then,
Tyl scho had hur brode hen                                  80
Set in hur Lap.

A gay gyrdyl Tyb had on, borowed for the nonys,[150]
And a garland on hur hed ful of rounde bonys,[151][152]
And a broche on hur brest ful of 'sapphyre' stonys,[153]
Wyth the holy-rode tokenyng,[154] was wrotyn[155] for the nonys;[156]85
For no 'spendings' thay had spared.[157]
When joly Gyb saw hur thare,
He gyrd so hys gray mare,
'That scho lete a fowkin'[158] fare[159]
At the rereward.                                        90

I wow to God, quoth Herry, I schal not lefe behynde,
May I mete wyth Bernard on Bayard the blynde,
Ich man kepe hym out of my wynde,
For whatsoever that he be, before me I fynde,
I wot I schall hym greve.                                       95[Pg 23]
Wele sayd, quoth Hawkyn.
And I wow, quoth Dawkyn,
May I mete wyth Tomkyn,
Hys flayle I schal hym reve.[160]

I make a vow, quoth Hud, Tyb, son schal thou se,                   100
Whych of all thys bachelery 'granted' is the gre:[161]
I schal scomfet[162] thaym all, for the love of the;
In what place so I come thay schal have dout[163] of me,
Myn armes ar so clere:
I bere a reddyl,[164] and a rake,                          105
Poudred wyth a brenand drake,[165]
And three cantells[166] of a cake
In ycha[167] cornere.

I vow to God, quoth Hawkyn, yf 'I' have the gowt,[168][169]
Al that I fynde in the felde 'thrustand' here aboute,[170]         110
Have I twyes or thryes redyn thurgh the route,
In ycha stede ther thay[171] me se, of me thay schal have doute,
When I begyn to play.
I make avowe that I ne schall,
But yf Tybbe wyl me call,[172]                             115
Or I be thryes don fall,[173]
Ryyt onys[174] com away.

Then sayd Terry, and swore be hys crede;
Saw thou never yong boy forther hys body bede,[175]
For when thay fyyt fastest and most ar in drede,                   120
I schall take Tyb by the hand, and hur away lede:
I am armed at the full;[Pg 24]
In myn armys I bere wele
A doy trogh[176] and a pele,[177]
A sadyll wythout a panell,                                 125
Wyth a fles of woll.[178]

I make a vow, quoth Dudman, and swor be the stra,
Whyls me ys left my 'mare,' thou gets hurr not swa;[179][180]
For scho ys wele schapen, and liyt as the rae,[181]
Ther is no capul[182] in thys myle befor hur schal ga;[183]        130
Sche wul ne noyt begyle:
Sche wyl me bere, I dar say,
On a lang somerys day,
Fro Hyssylton to Hakenay,
Noyt other half myle.                                 135

I make a vow, quoth Perkyn, thow speks of cold rost,
I schal wyrch 'wyselyer'[184] withouten any bost:[185]
Five of the best capulys, that ar in thys ost,
I wot I schal thaym wynne, and bryng thaym to my cost,
And here I grant thaym Tybbe.                                  140
Wele boyes here ys he,
That wyl fyyt, and not fle,
For I am in my jolyte,
Wyth so forth, Gybbe.

When thay had ther vowes made, furth can thay hie,                 145
Wyth flayles, and hornes, and trumpes mad of tre:[186]
Ther were all the bachelerys of that contre;
Thay were dyyt[187] in aray, as thaymselfes wold be:
Thayr baners were ful bryyt[Pg 25]
Of an old rotten fell;[188]                                150
The cheveron of a plow-mell;[189][190]
And the schadow of a bell,
Poudred wyth the mone lyyt.[191]

I wot yt 'was' no chylder[192] game, whan thay togedyr met,[193]
When icha freke[194] in the feld on hys feloy[195] bet,            155
And layd on styfly, for nothyng wold thay let,
And foght ferly[196] fast, tyll ther horses swet,
And few wordys spoken.
Ther were flayles al to slatred,[197]
Ther were scheldys al to flatred,                          160
Bollys and dysches al to schatred,
And many hedys brokyn

There was clynkyng of cart-sadellys, &amp; clatteryng of cannes;[198]
Of fele frekys[199] in the feld brokyn were their fannes;
Of sum were the hedys brokyn, of sum the braynpannes,[200]         165
And yll were thay besene,[201] or thay went thanns,
Wyth swyppyng of swepyls:[202]
Thay were so wery for-foght,[203]
Thay myyt not fyyt mare oloft,[204]
But creped about in the 'croft,'[205]                      170
As thay were croked crepyls.
[Pg 26]
Perkyn was so wery, that he began to loute;[206]
Help, Hud, I am ded in thys ylk rowte:
An hors for forty pens, a gode and a stoute!
That I may lyytly come of my noye[207] oute,                       175
For no cost wyl I spare.
He styrt up as a snayle,
And hent[208] a capul be the tayle,
And 'reft' Dawkin hys flayle,[209]
And wan there a mare.                                  180

Perkyn wan five, and Hud wan twa:
Glad and blythe thay ware, that they had done sa;
Thay wold have tham to Tyb, and present hur with tha:[210]
The Capulls were so wery, that thay myyt not ga,
But styl gon thay stond.[211]                                  185
Alas! quoth Hudde, my joye I lese;[212]
Mee had lever then a ston of chese,
That dere Tyb had al these,
And wyst it were my sond.[213][214]

Perkyn turnyd hym about in that ych thrang,[215]                   190
Among thos wery boyes he wrest and he wrang;
He threw tham doun to the erth, and thrast tham amang,
When he saw Tyrry away wyth Tyb fang,[216]
And after hym ran;
Off his horse he hym drogh,[217]                           195
And gaf hym of hys flayl inogh:
We te he! quoth Tyb, and lugh,
Ye er a dughty man.
[Pg 27]
'Thus' thay tugged, and rugged, tyl yt was nere nyyt:[218]
All the wyves of Tottenham came to se that syyt                    200
Wyth wyspes, and kexis,[219] and ryschys[220] there lyyt,
To fetch hom ther husbandes, that were tham trouth plyyt;
And sum br&oacute;yt gret harwos,[221]
Ther husbandes hom to fetch,[222]
Sum on dores, and sum on hech,[223]                        205
Sum on hyrdyllys, and som on crech.[224]
And sum on whele-barows.

Thay gaderyd Perkyn about, 'on' everych syde,[225]
And grant hym ther 'the gre,' the more was hys pryde:[226]
Tyb and he, wyth gret 'mirth,' homward con thay ryde,[227]         210
And were al nyyt togedyr, tyl the morn tyde;
And thay 'to church went:'[228]
So wele hys nedys he has sped,
That dere Tyb he 'hath' wed;[229]
The prayse-folk,[230] that hur led,[231]                   215
Were of the Turnament.

To that ylk fest com many for the nones;
Some come hyphalte,[232] and some trippand 'thither' on the stonys;[233]
Sum a staf in hys hand, and sum two at onys;
Of sum where the hedes broken, of some the schulder bonys:         220
With sorrow come thay thedyr.[Pg 28]
Wo was Hawkyn, wo was Herry,
Wo was Tomkyn, wo was Terry.
And so was all the bachelary,
When thay met togedyr.                                 225

[234]At that fest thay wer servyd with a ryche aray,
Every fyve &amp; fyve had a cokenay;[235]
And so thay sat in jolyte al the lung day;
And at the last thay went to bed with ful gret deray:[236]
Mekyl myrth was them among;                                    230
In every corner of the hous
Was melody delycyous
For to here precyus
Of six menys song.[237]

V.

FOR THE VICTORY AT AGINCOURT.



  

That our plain and martial ancestors could wield their
swords much better than their pens, will appear from
the following homely rhymes, which were drawn up
by some poet laureat of those days to celebrate the
immortal victory gained at Agincourt, Oct. 25, 1415. This song
or hymn is given meerly as a curiosity, and is printed from a MS.
copy in the Pepys collection, vol. i. folio. It is there accompanied
with the musical notes, which are copied on the opposite page.





[When the news of this great victory arrived in England, the
people "were literally mad with joy and triumph," and although
Henry V. on his entrance into London after the battle, commanded
that no "ditties should be made and sung by minstrels or
others" in praise of Agincourt, "for that he would whollie have
the praise and thankes altogether given to God," several songs
have come down to us on this soul-inspiring theme. Besides the
present ballad there are,

1. Agincourte Battell, beginning&mdash;


"A councell brave our King did hold,"




in the Percy Folio MS. (see Hales and Furnivall's edition, vol. ii.
p. 166).

2. Agincourt, or the English Bowman's Glory, a spirited ballad
quoted in Heywood's King Edward IV., the first stanza of which
is as follows&mdash;


"Agincourt, Agincourt!
Know ye not Agincourt?
Where English slue and hurt
All their French foemen?
With our pikes and bills brown,
How the French were beat downe,
Shot by our bowman."




3. King Henry V., his Conquest of France, commencing&mdash;


"As our King lay musing on his bed."


[Pg 32]

4. The Cambro-Briton's Ballad of Agincourt, by Michael Drayton.

Besides these ballads there is a poem attributed to Lydgate,
and Drayton's Battaile of Agincourt. For further information on
the subject the reader should see Sir Nicholas Harris Nicolas's
History of the Battle, and Hales and Furnivall's edition of the
Percy Folio MS. (vol. ii. pp. 158, 595).

Dr. Rimbault describes the music attached to the present ballad
"as the first English regular composition of which we have any
remains."]



Deo gratias Anglia redde pro victoria!



  



Owre kynge went forth to Normandy,
With grace and myyt of chivalry;
The God for hym wrouyt marvelously,
Wherefore Englonde may calle, and cry                                5
Deo gratias:
Deo gratias Anglia redde pro victoria.

He sette a sege, the sothe for to say,
To Harflue[238] toune with ryal aray;
That toune he wan, and made a fray,                                 10
That Fraunce shall rywe tyl domes day.
Deo gratias, &amp;c.

Then went owre kynge, with alle his oste,
Thorowe Fraunce for all the Frenshe boste;
He spared 'for' drede of leste, ne most,                            15
Tyl he come to Agincourt coste.[239]
Deo gratias, &amp;c.

Than for sothe that knyyt comely
In Agincourt feld he fauyt manly,
Thorow grace of God most myyty                                      20
He had bothe the felde, and the victory.
Deo gratias, &amp;c.
[Pg 33]
Ther dukys, and erlys, lorde and barone,
Were take, and slayne, and that wel sone,
And some were ledde in to Lundone                                   25
With joye, and merthe, and grete renone.
Deo gratias, &amp;c.

Now gracious God he save owre kynge,
His peple, and all his wel wyllynge,
Gef him gode lyfe, and gode endynge,                                30
That we with merth mowe savely synge
Deo gratias:
Deo gratias Anglia redde pro victoria.

The sentimental beauties of this ancient ballad have
always recommended it to readers of taste, notwithstanding
the rust of antiquity which obscures the style
and expression. Indeed if it had no other merit than
the having afforded the groundwork to Prior's Henry and Emma,
this ought to preserve it from oblivion. That we are able to give
it in so correct a manner, is owing to the great care and exactness
of the accurate editor of the Prolusions, 8vo. 1760; who has
formed the text from two copies found in two different editions of
Arnolde's Chronicle, a book supposed to be first printed about
1521. From the copy in the Prolusions the following is printed,
with a few additional improvements gathered from another edition
of Arnolde's book[240] preserved in the public library at Cambridge.
All the various readings of this copy will be found here, either
[Pg 34]received into the text, or noted in the margin. The references to
the Prolusions will shew where they occur. In our ancient folio
MS.[241] described in the preface, is a very corrupt and defective copy
of this ballad, which yet afforded a great improvement in one
passage. See v. 310.

It has been a much easier task to settle the text of this poem,
than to ascertain its date. The ballad of the Nutbrowne Mayd
was first revived in The Muses Mercury for June, 1707, 4to. being
prefaced with a little Essay on the old English Poets and Poetry;
in which this poem is concluded to be "near 300 years old," upon
reasons which, though they appear inconclusive to us now, were
sufficient to determine Prior, who there first met with it. However,
this opinion had the approbation of the learned Wanley, an
excellent judge of ancient books. For that whatever related to
the reprinting of this old piece was referred to Wanley, appears
from two letters of Prior's preserved in the British Museum (Harl.
MSS. No. 3777). The editor of the Prolusions thinks it cannot
be older than the year 1500, because, in Sir Thomas More's tale
of The Serjeant, &amp;c., which was written about that time, there
appears a sameness of rhythmus and orthography, and a very near
affinity of words and phrases with those of this ballad. But this
reasoning is not conclusive, for if Sir Thomas More made this
ballad his model, as is very likely, that will account for the sameness
of measure, and in some respect for that of words and phrases,
even tho' this had been written long before; and as for the orthography,
it is well known that the old printers reduced that of
most books to the standard of their own times. Indeed it is
hardly probable that an antiquary like Arnolde would have inserted
it among his historical collections, if it had been then a
modern piece; at least he would have been apt to have named its
author. But to shew how little can be inferred from a resemblance
of rhythmus or style, the Editor of these volumes has in his ancient
folio MS. a poem on the victory of Flodden-field, written in the
same numbers, with the same alliterations, and in orthography,
phraseology, and style nearly resembling the Visions of Pierce
Plowman, which are yet known to have been composed above 160
years before that battle. As this poem is a great curiosity, we
shall give a few of the introductory lines:


"Grant gracious God, grant me this time,
That I may say, or I cease, thy selven to please;
And Mary his mother, that maketh all this world;
And all the seemlie saints, that sitten in heaven;
I will carpe of kings, that conquered full wide,[Pg 35]
That dwelled in this land, that was alyes noble;
Henry the seaventh, that soveraigne lord," &amp;c.[242]


With regard to the date of the following ballad, we have taken
a middle course, neither placed it so high as Wanley and Prior,
nor quite so low as the editor of the Prolusions; we should have
followed the latter in dividing every other line into two, but that
the whole would then have taken up more room than could be
allowed it in this volume.





[The edition of Richard Arnold's Chronicle (1521) mentioned
above, is the second; and the first, which is undated, was printed
at Antwerp in 1502. This edition is described in Brydges' Censur&auml;
Literaria (vol. vi. p. 114), where the Nut-Brown Maid is printed.
A copy from the Balliol MS. 354, of about the same date, is
printed in Percy's folio manuscript, ed. Hales and Furnivall,
vol iii. p. 174. Warton will not allow that the poem was written
before the beginning of the sixteenth century, but as Percy says,
it is highly improbable that an antiquary would insert a modern
piece in his miscellany of curiosities.

Percy has inserted the following note in his folio MS.: "From
the concluding words of this last stanza&mdash;


['but men wold that men shold
be kind to them eche one,
yett I had rather, god to obay
and serve but him alone']




it should seem that the author was a woman."

Mr. Skeat remarks that the part of the fourth stanza before the
woman speaks, and the first two verses, are still more conclusive
on this point. On the other side it is noticeable that the author
speaks as a man at line 353:


"... that we may
To them be comfortable;"




but this may only be a blind.

Few readers will agree with Percy's estimate of Prior's poem,
and Henry and Emma is now only remembered because of its
connection with the Nut-Brown Maid.

Warton justly points out how the simplicity of the original is
decorated, dilated, and consequently spoilt by Prior, who crowds
his verses with zephyrs, Chloe, Mars, the Cyprian deity, &amp;c. Such
lay figures as these are quite out of keeping with the realities of
this most exquisite poem.
[Pg 36]
One instance of Prior's inability to appreciate the beauties of his
original will be sufficient. The tender allusion at v. 232-3:


"O my swete mother, before all other
For you I have most drede,"




followed by the reflection:


"But nowe adue! I must ensue
Where fortune doth me lede,"




is entirely omitted by the later poet, who changes


"To shorte my here, a bowe to bere,
To shote in tyme of nede,"




into


"Wanting the scissors, with these hands I'll tear
(If that obstructs my flight) this load of hair."




The Nut-Brown Maid has always been highly popular (a proof
of the good taste of the people), and in consequence it figures in
Captain Cox's collection described by Laneham. Another proof
of its popularity is the existence of various parodies, one of
which is of very early date.

It was a common practice in the sixteenth century to turn ordinary
ballads into religious songs. The New Nutbrowne Maid,
printed by John Skot about 1520, reprinted by George Isted in
1820 for the Roxburghe Club, and again reprinted by Dr. Rimbault
for the Percy Society (vol. iv.), 1842, is an instance of this
practice. It is a close parody of the original, and purports to be
"upon the passion of Cryste." The he and she are changed to
Maria the mayde and Jesus.

Another version is given in the Percy folio MS. (ed. Hales and
Furnivall, vol. ii. p. 334), which is entitled A Jigge.

The incidents are vulgarized, "but," Mr. Hales observes, "the
beauty of the original is too great to be altogether destroyed, however
rude the hands that handle it. Something of the charm of the
Nut Brown Maid lingers around this Jig."]

Be it ryght, or wrong, these men among[243]
On women do complayne:[244][245]
Affyrmynge this, how that it is
A labour spent in vayne,
To love them wele; for never a dele[246]                             5
They love a man agayne:
For late a man do what he can,
Theyr favour to attayne,
Yet, yf a newe do them persue,
Theyr first true lover than                                       10
Laboureth for nought; for from her[247] thought[248]
He is a banyshed man.

I say nat nay, but that all day
It is bothe writ and sayd
That womans faith is, as who sayth,                                 15
All utterly decayd;
But, neverthelesse, ryght good wytn&egrave;sse
In this case might be layd,
That they love true, and contin&ugrave;e:
Recorde the Not-browne Mayde:                                     20
Which, when her love came, her to prove,
To her to make his mone,
Wolde nat depart; for in her hart
She loved but hym alone.
[Pg 38]
Than betwaine us late us dyscus                                     25
What was all the manere
Betwayne them two: we wyll also
Tell all the payne, and fere,[249]
That she was in. Nowe I begyn,
So that ye me answ&egrave;re;                                            30
Wherfore, all ye, that present be
I pray you, gyve an ere.
"I am the knyght; I come by nyght,
As secret as I can;
Sayinge, Alas! thus standeth the case,                              35
I am a banyshed man."

And I your wyll for to fulfyll
In this wyll nat refuse;
Trustying to shewe, in word&egrave;s fewe,
That men have an yll use                                          40
(To theyr own shame) women to blame,
And causelesse them accuse:
Therfore to you I answere nowe,
All women to excuse,&mdash;


She.[250]



Myne owne hart dere, with you what chere?                           45
I pray you, tell anone;
For, in my mynde, of all mankynde
I love but you alone.


He.



It standeth so; a dede is do[251]
Wherof grete harme shall growe:                                   50
My destiny is for to dy
A shamefull deth, I trowe;
Or elles to fle: the one must be.[Pg 39]
None other way I knowe,
But to withdrawe as an outlawe,                                     55
And take me to my bowe.
Wherfore, adue, my owne hart true!
None other rede I can:[252]
For I must to the grene wode go,
Alone, a banyshed man.                                            60


She.



O lord, what is thys worldys blysse,
That changeth as the mone!
My somers day in lusty may[253]
Is derked[254] before the none.
I here you say, farewell: Nay, nay                                  65
We d&egrave;part[255] nat so sone.
Why say ye so? wheder[256] wyll ye go?
Alas! what have ye done?
All my welf&agrave;re to sorrowe and care
Sholde chaunge, yf ye were gone;                                  70
For, in my mynde, of all mankynde
I love but you alone.


He.



I can beleve, it shall you greve,
And somewhat you dystrayne;[257]
But, aftyrwarde, your paynes harde                                  75
Within a day or twayne
Shall sone aslake;[258] and ye shall take
Comfort to you agayne.
Why sholde ye ought? for, to make thought,
Your labour were in vayne.                                        80
And thus I do; and pray you to,[Pg 40]
As hartely,[259] as I can;
For I must to the grene wode go,
Alone, a banyshed man.


She.



Now, syth that ye have shewed to me                                 85
The secret of your mynde,
I shall be playne to you agayne,
Lyke as ye shall me fynde.
Syth it is so, that ye wyll go,
I wolle not leve[260] behynde;                                    90
Shall never be sayd, the Not-browne Mayd[261]
Was to her love unkynde:
Make you redy, for so am I,
Allthough it were anone;[262]
For, in my mynde, of all mankynde                                   95
I love but you alone.


He.



Yet I you rede[263] to take good hede
What men wyll thynke, and say:
Of yonge, and olde it shall be tolde,
That ye be gone away,                                            100
Your wanton wyll for to fulfill,
In grene wode you to play;
And that ye myght from your delyght
No lenger make delay.
Rather than ye sholde thus for me                                  105
Be called an yll wom&agrave;n,
Yet wolde I to the grene wode go,
Alone, a banyshed man.


[Pg 41]

She.



Though it be songe of old and yonge,
That I sholde be to blame,                                       110
Theyrs be the charge, that speke so large
In hurtynge of my name:
For I wyll prove, that faythfulle love
It is devoyd of shame;
In your dystresse, and hevynesse,                                  115
To part with you, the same:
And sure all tho,[264] that do not so,[265]
True lovers are they none;
For, in my mynde, of all mankynde
I love but you alone.                                            120


He.



I counceyle you, remember howe,
It is no maydens lawe,
Nothynge to dout, but to renne[266] out
To wode with an outl&agrave;we:
For ye must there in your hand bere                                125
A bowe, redy to drawe;
And, as a thefe, thus must you lyve,
Ever in drede and awe;
Wherby to you grete harme myght growe:
Yet had I lever than,[267]                                       130
That I had to the grene wode go,
Alone, a banyshed man.


She.



I thinke nat nay, but as ye say,[268]
It is no maydens lore:
But love may make me for your sake,                                135
As I have sayd before
To come on fote, to hunt, and shote[Pg 42]
To gete us mete in store;[269]
For so that I your company
May have, I aske no more:                                        140
From which to part, it maketh my hart
As colde as ony stone;
For, in my mynde, of all mankynde
I love but you alone.


He.



For an outlawe this is the lawe,                                   145
That men hym take and bynde;
Without pyt&egrave;, hanged to be,
And waver with the wynde.
If I had nede, (as God forbede!)
What rescous[270] coude ye fynde?[271]                           150
Forsoth, I trowe, ye and your bowe
For fere wolde drawe behynde:
And no mervayle; for lytell avayle
Were in your counceyle than:
Wherfore I wyll to the grene wode go,                              155
Alone, a banyshed man.


She.



Ryght wele knowe ye, that women be
But feble for to fyght;
No womanhede it is indede
To be bolde as a knyght:                                         160
Yet, in such fere yf that ye were
With enemyes day or nyght,[272]
I wolde withstande, with bowe in hande,
To greve them as I myght,[273]
And you to save; as women have                                     165[Pg 43]
From deth 'men' many one:
For, in my mynde, of all mankynde
I love but you alone.


He.



Yet take good hede; for ever I drede
That ye coude nat sustayne                                       170
The thornie wayes, the depe val&egrave;ies,
The snowe, the frost, the rayne,[274]
The colde, the hete: for dry, or wete,
We must lodge on the playne;[275]
And, us above, none other rofe                                     175
But a brake bush, or twayne:
Which sone sholde greve you, I beleve;
And ye wolde gladly than
That I had to the grene wode go,
Alone, a banyshed man.                                           180


She.



Syth I have here bene partyn&egrave;re
With you of joy and blysse,
I must also parte of your wo
Endure, as reson is:
Yet am I sure of one ples&ugrave;re;                                      185
And, shortely, it is this:
That, where ye be, me semeth, pard&egrave;,
I coude nat fare amysse.
Without more speche, I you beseche
That we were sone agone;[276]                                    190
For, in my mynde, of all mankynde
I love but you alone.


[Pg 44]

He.



If ye go thyder, ye must consyder,
Whan ye have lust to dyne,
There shall no mete be for you gete,                               195
Nor drinke, bere, ale, ne wyne.[277]
No shet&eacute;s clene, to lye betwene,
Made of threde and twyne;
None other house, but leves and bowes,
To cover your hed and myne,                                      200
O myne harte swete, this evyll dy&eacute;te[278]
Sholde make you pale and wan;
Wherfore I wyll to the grene wode go,
Alone, a banyshed man.


She.



Amonge the wylde dere, such an arch&egrave;re,                            205
As men say that ye be,
Ne may nat fayle of good vitayle,[279]
Where is so grete plent&egrave;:
And water clere of the ryv&eacute;re
Shall be full swete to me;                                       210
With which in hele[280] I shall ryght wele
Endure, as ye shall see;
And, or we go, a bedde or two
I can provyde anone;
For, in my mynde, of all mankynde                                  215
I love but you alone.


He.



Lo yet, before, ye must do more,
Yf ye wyll go with me:
As cut your here up by your ere,[281][282]
Your kyrtel by the kne;[283]                                     220
With bowe in hande, for to withstande[Pg 45]
Your enemyes, yf nede be:
And this same nyght before day-lyght,[284]
To wode-warde wyll I fle.
Yf that ye wyll all this fulfill,                                  225
Do it shortely as ye can;
Els wyll I to the grene wode go,
Alone, a banyshed man.


She.



I shall as nowe do more for you
Than longeth to womanhede;                                       230
To shorte my here,[285] a bowe to bere,
To shote in tyme of nede.
O my swete mother, before all other
For you I have most drede:
But nowe, adue! I must ensue,[286]                                 235
Where fortune doth me lede.
All this make ye: Now let us fle;
The day cometh fast upon;
For, in my mynde, of all mankynde
I love but you alone.                                            240


He.



Nay, nay, nat so; ye shall nat go,
And I shall tell ye why,&mdash;
Your appetyght is to be lyght
Of love, I wele espy:
For, lyke as ye have sayed to me,                                  245
In lyke wyse hardely
Ye wolde answ&eacute;re whosoever it were,
In way of company.
It is sayd of olde, Sone hote, sone colde;[Pg 46]
And so is a wom&agrave;n.                                               250
Wherfore I to the wode wyll go,[287]
Alone, a banyshed man.


She.



Yf ye take hede, it is no nede[288]
Such wordes to say by me;
For oft ye prayed, and longe assayed,                              255
Or[289] I you loved, pard&egrave;:[290]
And though that I of auncestry
A barons daughter be,
Yet have you proved howe I you loved
A squyer of lowe degr&egrave;;                                          260
And ever shall, whatso befall;
To dy therfore[291] anone;[292]
For, in my mynde, of all mankynde
I love but you alone.


He.



A barons chylde to be begylde!                                     265
It were a cursed dede;
To be fel&agrave;we with an outlawe!
Almighty God forbede!
Yet beter were, the pore squy&egrave;re
Alone to forest yede,[293]                                       270
Than ye sholde say another day,
That, by my cursed dede,
Ye were betray'd: Wherfore, good mayd,
The best rede[294] that I can,
Is, that I to the grene wode go,                                   275
Alone, a banyshed man.


[Pg 47]

She.



Whatever befall, I never shall
Of this thyng you upbrayd:[295]
But yf ye go, and leve me so,
Than have ye me betrayd.                                         280
Remember you wele, howe that ye dele;
For, yf ye, as ye sayd,[296]
Be so unkynde, to leve behynde,[297]
Your love, the Not-browne Mayd,
Trust me truly, that I shall dy                                    285
Sone after ye be gone;
For, in my mynde, of all mankynde
I love but you alone.


He.



Yf that ye went, ye sholde repent;
For in the forest nowe                                           290
I have purvayed[298] me of a mayd,
Whom I love more than you;
Another fayr&egrave;re, than ever ye were,
I dare it wele avowe;
And of you bothe eche sholde be wrothe                             295
With other, as I trowe:
It were myne ese, to lyve in pese;
So wyll I, yf I can;
Wherfore I to the wode wyll go,
Alone, a banyshed man.                                           300

Though in the wode I undyrstode
Ye had a paramour,
All this may nought remove my thought,
But that I wyll be your:
And she shall fynde me soft, and kynde,                            305[Pg 48]
And courteys every hour;
Glad to fulfyll all that she wyll
Commaunde me to my power:
For had ye, lo, an hundred mo,
'Of them I wolde be one;'[299]                                   310
For, in my mynde, of all mankynde
I love but you alone.


He.



Myne owne dere love, I se the prove
That ye be kynde, and true;
Of mayde, and wyfe, in all my lyfe,[300]                           315
The best that ever I knewe.
Be mery and glad, be no more sad,
The case is chaunged newe;
For it were ruthe, that, for your truthe,
Ye sholde have cause to rewe.                                    320
Be nat dismayed; whatsoever I sayd
To you, whan I began;
I wyll nat to the grene wode go,
I am no banyshed man.


She.



These tydings be more gladd to me,[301]                            325
Than to be made a quene,
Yf I were sure they sholde endure:
But it is often sene,
Whan men wyll breke promyse, they speke
The word&eacute;s on the splene.[302]                                   330
Ye shape some wyle me to begyle,
And stele from me, I wene:
Than, were the case worse than it was,[Pg 49]
And I more wo-begone:
For, in my mynde, of all mankynde                                  335
I love but you alone.

Of so grete a lyn&agrave;ge.[303]                                       340
Nowe undyrstande; to Westmarlande,

By way of maryage
I wyll you take, and lady make,                                    345
As shortely as I can:
Thus have you won an erlys son,[304]
And not a banyshed man.[305]

VII.

A BALET BY THE EARL RIVERS.



  

The amiable light in which the character of Anthony
Widville, the gallant Earl Rivers, has been placed by
the elegant author of the Catal. of Noble Writers
[Horace Walpole], interests us in whatever fell from his
pen. It is presumed, therefore, that the insertion of this little
sonnet will be pardoned, tho' it should not be found to have much
poetical merit. It is the only original poem known of that nobleman's;
his more voluminous works being only translations. And
if we consider that it was written during his cruel confinement in
Pomfret castle a short time before his execution in 1483, it gives
us a fine picture of the composure and steadiness with which this
stout earl beheld his approaching fate.

This ballad we owe to Rouse, a contemporary historian, who
seems to have copied it from the earl's own handwriting. "In
tempore," says this writer, "incarcerationis apud Pontem-fractum
edidit unum balet in anglicis, ut mihi monstratum est, quod subsequitur
sub his verbis: Sum what musyng, &amp;c." Rossi, Hist. 8vo.
2 ed. p. 213. In Rouse the second stanza, &amp;c. is imperfect, but
the defects are here supplied from a more perfect copy printed in
Ancient Songs, from the time of King Henry III. to the Revolution,
p. 87 [by Joseph Ritson].

This little piece, which perhaps ought rather to have been
printed in stanzas of eight short lines, is written in imitation of a
poem of Chaucer's, that will be found in Urry's ed. 1721, p. 555,
beginning thus:


"Alone walkyng, In thought plainyng,
And sore sighying, All desolate.
My remembrying Of my livyng
My death wishyng Bothe erly and late.
Infortunate Is so my fate
That wote ye what, Out of mesure
My life I hate; Thus desperate
In such pore estate, Doe I endure," &amp;c.[310]

[Pg 51]




[This gallant and learned nobleman (brother of Edward
IV.'s queen), who was murdered in the forty-first year of his
age, figures as a character in Shakspere's Richard III., and as a
ghost appears to warn the tyrant on the eve of the battle of Bosworth:


"Let me sit heavy on thy soul to-morrow,
Rivers that died at Pomfret! despair and die."]





  



Sumwhat musyng, And more mornyng,
In remembring The unstydfastnes;
This world being Of such whelyng,
Me contrarieng, What may I gesse?

I fere dowtles, Remediles,                                           5

[For unkyndness, Withouten less,
And no redress, Me doth avaunce,

With displesaunce, To my grevaunce,
And no suraunce Of remedy.]                                       10
Lo in this traunce, Now in substaunce,
Such is my dawnce, Wyllyng to dye.

VIII.

CUPID'S ASSAULT: BY LORD VAUX.



  

The reader will think that infant poetry grew apace between
the times of Rivers and Vaux, tho' nearly contemporaries;
if the following song is the composition of
that Sir Nicholas (afterwards Lord) Vaux, who was the
shining ornament of the court of Henry VII., and died in the year
1523 [1524, see below].

And yet to this lord it is attributed by Puttenham in his Art of
Eng. Poesie, 1589, 4to., a writer commonly well informed. Take
the passage at large: "In this figure [Counterfait Action] the Lord
Nicholas Vaux, a noble gentleman and much delighted in vulgar
making, and a man otherwise of no great learning, but having
herein a marvelous facilitie, made a dittie representing the Battayle
and Assault of Cupide, so excellently well, as for the gallant and
propre application of his fiction in every part, I cannot choose but
set downe the greatest part of his ditty, for in truth it cannot be
amended. When Cupid Scaled," &amp;c. p. 200. For a farther account
of Nicholas, Lord Vaux, see Mr. Walpole's Noble Authors,
vol. i.

Since this song was first printed off, reasons have occurred which
incline me to believe that Lord Vaux, the poet, was not the Lord
Nicholas Vaux who died in 1523, but rather a successor of his in
the title. For, in the first place, it is remarkable that all the old
writers mention Lord Vaux, the poet, as contemporary, or rather
posterior, to Sir Thomas Wyat and the E. of Surrey, neither of
which made any figure till long after the death of the first Lord
Nicholas Vaux. Thus Puttenham, in his Art of English Poesie,
1589, in p. 48, having named Skelton, adds: "In the latter end
of the same kings raigne [Henry VIII.] sprong up a new company
of courtly Makers [Poets], of whom Sir Thomas Wyat th' elder,
and Henry Earl of Surrey were the two chieftaines, who having
travailed into Italie, and there tasted the sweet and stately measures
and stile of the Italian poesie ... greatly polished our
rude and homely manner of vulgar poesie.... In the same time,
or not long after, was the Lord Nicholas Vaux, a man of much
facilitie in vulgar makings."[318] Webbe, in his Discourse of English
[Pg 53]Poetrie, 1586, ranges them in the following order: "The E. of
Surrey, the Lord Vaux, Norton, Bristow." And Gascoigne, in the
place quoted in the first volume of this work [B. ii. No. 2.] mentions
Lord Vaux after Surrey. Again, the stile and measure of
Lord Vaux's pieces seem too refined and polished for the age of
Henry VII., and rather resemble the smoothness and harmony of
Surrey and Wyat, than the rude metre of Skelton and Hawes.
But what puts the matter out of all doubt, in the British Museum
is a copy of his poem, I lothe that I did love [vid. vol. i. ubi supra],
with this title, "A dyttye or sonet made by the Lord Vaus, in the
time of the noble Quene Marye, representing the image of Death."
Harl. MSS. No. 1703, sec. 25.

It is evident then that Lord Vaux, the poet, was not he that
flourished in the reign of Henry VII., but either his son or grandson;
and yet, according to Dugdale's Baronage, the former was
named Thomas and the latter William: but this difficulty is not
great, for none of the old writers mention the Christian name of
the poetic Lord Vaux,[319] except Puttenham; and it is more likely
that he might be mistaken in that lord's name, than in the time in
which he lived, who was so nearly his contemporary.

Thomas, Lord Vaux, of Harrowden, in Northamptonshire, was
summoned to parliament in 1531. When he died does not appear,
but he probably lived till the latter end of Queen Mary's
reign, since his son William was not summoned to parliament till
the last year of that reign, in 1558. This lord died in 1595. See
Dugdale, vol. ii. p. 304. Upon the whole I am inclined to believe
that Lord Thomas was the poet.

The following copy is printed from the first edition of Surrey's
Poems, 1557, 4to. See another song of Lord Vaux's in the preceding
volume, B. ii. No. 2.





[Percy is correct in his supposition that the poet was Thomas,
second Lord Vaux, and not his father Nicholas, who died May
14th, 1524, only seventeen days after he was advanced to the
peerage.]
[Pg 54]



  



When Cupide scaled first the fort,
Wherein my hart lay wounded sore;
The batry was of such a sort,
That I must yelde or die therfore.

There sawe I Love upon the wall,                                     5
How he his banner did display;
Alarme, alarme, he gan to call:
And bad his souldiours kepe aray.

The armes, the which that Cupide bare,
Were pearced hartes with teares besprent,[320]                    10
In silver and sable to declare
The stedfast love, he alwayes ment.

There might you se his band all drest
In colours like to white and blacke,
With powder and with pelletes prest                                 15
To bring the fort to spoile and sacke.

Good-wyll, the maister of the shot,
Stode in the rampire[321] brave and proude,
For spence[322] of pouder he spared not
Assault! assault! to crye aloude.                                 20

There might you heare the cannons rore;
Eche pece discharged a lovers loke;
Which had the power to rent, and tore
In any place whereas they toke.

And even with the trumpettes sowne[323]                             25
The scaling ladders were up set,
And Beautie walked up and downe,
With bow in hand, and arrowes whet.
[Pg 55]
Then first Desire began to scale,
And shrouded him under 'his' targe;[324][325]                     30
As one the worthiest of them all,
And aptest for to geve the charge.

Then pushed souldiers with their pikes,
And halberdes with handy strokes;
The argabushe[326] in fleshe it lightes,                            35
And duns the ayre with misty smokes.

And, as it is the souldiers use
When shot and powder gins to want,
I hanged up my flagge of truce,
And pleaded up for my liv&egrave;s grant.                                40

When Fansy thus had made her breche,
And Beauty entred with her band,
With bagge and baggage, sely[327] wretch,
I yelded into Beauties hand.

Then Beautie bad to blow retrete,                                   45
And every souldier to retire,
And mercy wyll'd with spede to set
Me captive bound as prisoner.

Madame, quoth I, sith that this day
Hath served you at all assayes,                                   50
I yeld to you without delay
Here of the fortresse all the kayes.

And sith that I have ben the marke,
At whom you shot at with your eye;
Nedes must you with your handy warke,                               55
Or salve my sore, or let me die.

IX.

SIR ALDINGAR.



  

This old fabulous legend is given from the Editor's folio
MS. with conjectural emendations, and the insertion of
some additional stanzas to supply and compleat the
story.

It has been suggested to the Editor that the author of this poem
seems to have had in his eye the story of Gunhilda, who is sometimes
called Eleanor, and was married to the Emperor (here called
King) Henry.



Percy's MS. note in his folio is as follows: "Without some
corrections this will not do for my Reliques." Readers will be able
to judge for themselves as to the relative beauties of the two, now
that the original is printed at the end of Percy's amended copy.
To make the interpolations more apparent, Percy's added verses
are placed between brackets, and it will be seen that these contain
much of the phraseology and many of the stock prettinesses of the
polite ballad-monger; some of the most vivid bits of the old ballad
being passed over. Percy keeps tolerably to the story, except
that he makes the second messenger one of the queen's damsels
instead of a man. Sir Walter Scott supposes Sir Aldingar to be
founded upon the kindred ballad of Sir Hugh le Blond, but, as
Professor Child says, without any reason. The story occurs in
most of the literatures of Europe.




  



Our king he kept a false stew&agrave;rde,
Sir Aldingar they him call;
[A falser steward than he was one,
Servde not in bower nor hall.]

He wolde have layne by our comelye queene,                           5
Her deere worshippe to betraye:
Our queene she was a good wom&agrave;n,
And evermore said him naye.[Pg 57]

Sir Aldingar was wrothe in his mind,
With her hee was never content,                                   10
[Till traiterous meanes he colde devyse,]
In a fyer to have her brent.[328]

There came a lazar[329] to the kings gate,
A lazar both blinde and lame:
He tooke the lazar upon his backe,                                  15
Him on the queenes bed has layne.

"Lye still, laz&agrave;r, wheras thou lyest,
Looke thou goe not hence away;
Ile make thee a whole man and a sound
In two howers of the day."[330]                                   20

Then went him forth sir Aldingar,
[And hyed him to our king:]
"If I might have grace, as I have space,
["Sad tydings I could bring."]

Say on, say on, sir Aldingar,                                       25
Saye on the soothe[331] to mee.
"Our queene hath chosen a new new l&ograve;ve,
And shee will have none of thee.

"If shee had chosen a right good knight,
The lesse had beene her shame;                                    30
But she hath chose her a lazar man,
A lazar both blinde and lame."

If this be true, thou Aldingar,
The tyding thou tellest to me,
Then will I make the a rich rich knight,                            35
Rich both of golde and fee.
[Pg 58]
But if it be false, sir Aldingar,
[As God nowe grant it bee!
Thy body, I sweare by the holye rood,]
Shall hang on the gallows tree.                                   40

[He brought our king to the queenes chamb&egrave;r,
And opend to him the dore.]
A lodlye[332] love, king Harry says,
For our queene dame Elinore!

If thou were a man, as thou art none,                               45
[Here on my sword thoust dye;]
But a payre of new gallowes shall be built,
And there shalt thou hang on hye.

[Forth then hyed our king, I wysse,
And an angry man was hee;                                         50
And soone he found queene Elinore,
That bride so bright of blee.[333]]

Now God you save, our queene, madame,
And Christ you save and see;
Heere you have chosen a newe newe love,                             55
And you will have none of mee.

If you had chosen a right good knight,
The lesse had been your shame:
But you have chose you a lazar man,
A lazar both blinde and lame.                                     60

[Therfore a fyer there shall be built,
And brent all shalt thou bee.&mdash;&mdash;]
"Now out alacke!" said our comly queene,
"Sir Aldingar's false to mee.

Now out alacke!" sayd our comlye queene,                            65
[My heart with griefe will brast.[334]]
I had thought swevens[335] had never been true,
I have proved them true at last.
[Pg 59]
I dreamt in my sweven on thursday eve,
In my bed wheras I laye,                                          70
I dreamt a grype[336] and a grimlie beast
Had carryed my crowne awaye;

My gorgett[337] and my kirtle[338] of golde,
And all my faire head-geere:
And he wold worrye me with his tush[339]                            75
And to his nest y-beare:

Saving there came a litle 'gray' hawke,[340]
A merlin him they call,
Which untill the grounde did strike the grype,
That dead he downe did fall.                                      80

Giffe[341] I were a man, as now I am none,
A battell wold I prove,
To fight with that traitor Aldingar;
Att him I cast my glove.

But seeing Ime able noe battell to make,                            85
My liege, grant me a knight
To fight with that traitor sir Aldingar,
To maintaine me in my right."

"Now forty dayes I will give thee
To seeke thee a knight therin:                                    90
If thou find not a knight in forty dayes
Thy bodye it must brenn."

[Then shee sent east, and shee sent west,
By north and south bedeene:[342]
But never a champion colde she find,]                               95
Wolde fight with that knight soe keene.
[Pg 60]
[Now twenty dayes were spent and gone,
Noe helpe there might be had;
Many a teare shed our comelye queene
And aye her hart was sad.                                         100

Then came one of the queenes dams&egrave;lles,
And knelt upon her knee,
"Cheare up, cheare up, my gracious dame,
I trust yet helpe may be:

"And here I will make mine avowe,[343]                             105
And with the same me binde;
That never will I return to thee,
Till I some helpe may finde."

Then forth she rode on a faire palfr&agrave;ye
Oer hill and dale about:                                         110
But never a champion colde she finde,
Wolde fighte with that knight so stout.

And nowe the daye drewe on a pace,
When our good queene must dye;
All woe-begone was that faire dams&egrave;lle,                            115
When she found no helpe was nye.

All woe-begone was that faire dams&egrave;lle,
And the salt teares fell from her eye:]
When lo! as she rode by a rivers side,
She met with a tinye boye.                                       120

[A tinye boye she mette, God wot,
All clad in mantle of golde;]
He seemed noe more in mans liken&egrave;sse,
Then a childe of four yeere olde.

[Why grieve you, damselle faire, he sayd,                          125
And what doth cause you moane?
The damsell scant wolde deigne a looke,
But fast she pricked on.]
[Pg 61]
Yet turn againe, thou fa&iuml;re dams&egrave;lle,
And greete thy queene from mee:                                  130
When bale[344] is att hyest, boote[345] is nyest,
Nowe helpe enoughe may bee.

Bid her remember what she dreamt
In her bedd, wheras shee laye;
How when the grype and the grimly beast                            135
Wolde have carried her crowne awaye,

Even then there came the litle gray hawke,
And saved her from his clawes:
Then bidd the queene be merry at hart,
[For heaven will fende[346] her cause.]                          140

Back then rode that faire dams&egrave;lle,
And her hart it lept for glee:
And when she told her gracious dame
A gladd woman then was shee.

[But when the appointed day was come,                              145
No helpe appeared nye:
Then woeful, woeful was her hart,
And the teares stood in her eye.

And nowe a fyer was built of wood;
And a stake was made of tree;                                    150
And now queene Elinor forth was led,
A sorrowful sight to see.

Three times the herault he waved his hand,
And three times spake on hye:
Giff any good knight will fende this dame,                         155
Come forth, or she must dye.

No knight stood forth, no knight there came,
No helpe appeared nye:
And now the fyer was lighted up,
Queen Elinor she must dye.                                       160
[Pg 62]
And now the fyer was lighted up,
As hot as hot might bee;]
When riding upon a little white steed,
The tinye boy they see.

"Away with that stake, away with those brands,                     165
And loose our comelye queene:
I am come to fight with sir Aldingar,
And prove him a traitor keene."

Forthe then stood sir Aldingar,
But when he saw the chylde,                                      170
He laughed, and scoffed, and turned his backe,
And weened[347] he had been beguylde.

"Now turne, now turne thee, Aldingar,
And eyther fighte or flee;
I trust that I shall avenge the wronge,                            175
Thoughe I am so small to see."

The boye pulld forth a well good sworde
So gilt it dazzled the ee;
The first stroke stricken at Aldingar
Smote off his leggs by the knee.                                 180

"Stand up, stand up, thou false trait&ograve;r,
And fight upon thy feete,
For and thou thrive, as thou begin'st,
Of height wee shall be meete."

A priest, a priest, sayes Alding&agrave;r,                                185
While I am a man alive.
A priest, a priest, sayes Alding&agrave;r,
Me for to houzle and shrive.[348]

I wolde have laine by our comlie queene,
Bot shee wolde never consent;                                    190
Then I thought to betraye her unto our kinge
In a fyer to have her brent.
[Pg 63]
There came a lazar to the kings gates,
A lazar both blind and lame:
I tooke the lazar upon my backe,                                   195
And on her bedd had him layne.

[Then ranne I to our comlye king,
These tidings sore to tell.]
But ever alacke! sayes Aldingar,
Falsing never doth well.                                         200

Forgive, forgive me, queene, madame,
The short time I must live.
"Nowe Christ forgive thee, Aldingar,
As freely I forgive."

Here take thy queene, our king Harry&egrave;,                             205
And love her as thy life,
[For never had a king in Christentye,
A truer and fairer wife.

King Henrye ran to claspe his queene,
And loos&egrave;d her full sone:                                        210
Then turnd to look for the tinye boye;
&mdash;&mdash;The boye was vanisht and gone.

But first he had touchd the lazar man,
And stroakt him with his hand:
The lazar under the gallowes tree                                  215
All whole and sounde did stand.]

The lazar under the gallowes tree
Was comelye, straight and tall;
King Henrye made him his head stew&agrave;rde
To wayte withinn his hall.                                       220

[The following is the original version from the folio MS
reprinted from Hales and Furnivall's ed. vol. i. p. 166:


Our king he kept a ffalse steward,
men called him Sir Aldingar[Pg 64]
he wold haue layen by our comely queene,
her deere worshipp to haue betraide.                               4
our queene shee was a good woman,
&amp; euer more said him nay.

Aldingar was offended in his mind,
with her hee was neuer content,                                    8
but he sought what meanes he cold find out,
in a fyer to haue her brent.

There came a lame lazer to the Kings gates,
a lazer was [b]lind &amp; lame;                                       12
he tooke the lazer vpon his backe,
vpon the queenes bed he did him lay:

he said, "lye still, lazer, wheras thou lyest,
looke thou goe not away,                                          16
Ile make thee a whole man &amp; a sound
in 2 howres of a day."

&amp; then went forth Sir Aldingar
our Queene for to betray,                                         20
and then he mett with our comlye King,
saies, "god you saue &amp; see!

"If I had space as I haue grace,
A message I wold say to thee."                                    24
"Say on, say on, Sir Aldingar,
say thou on and vnto me."

"I can let you now see one of [the] greiuos[est] sights
that euer Christen King did see:                                  28
Our Queene hath chosen a New New loue,
She will haue none of thee;

"If shee had chosen a right good Knight,
the lesse had beene her shame,                                    32
but she hath chosen a Lazar man
which is both blinde &amp; lame."

"If this be true, thou Aldingar,
that thou dost tell to me,                                        36
then will I make thee a rich Knight
both of gold and fee;

"But if it be false, Sir Aldingar,
that thou doest tell to me,                                       40
then looke for noe other death
but to be hangd on a tree.[Pg 65]
goe with me," saide our comly king,
"this Lazar for to see."                                          44

When the King he came into the queenes chamber,
standing her bed befor,
"there is a lodly lome," says Harry King
"for our dame Queene Elinor!                                      48

"If thou were a man, as thou art none,
here thou sholdest be slaine;
but a paire of new gallowes shall be biil[t]
thoust hang on them soe hye;                                      52

"and fayre fyer there shalbe bett,
and brent our Queene shal bee."
fforth then walked our comlye King,
&amp; mett with our comly Queene,                                     56

saies, "God you saue, our Queene, Madam,
and Christ you saue &amp; see!
heere you [haue] chosen a new new loue,
and you will haue none of mee.                                    60

"If you had chosen a right good Knight
the lesse he beene your shame,
but you haue chosen a lazar man
that is both blind &amp; lame."                                       64

"Euer alacke!" said our comly Queene,
"Sir Aldingar is false to mee;
but euer alacke!" said our comly Queene,
"Euer alas, &amp; woe is mee!                                         68

"I had thought sweuens had neuer been true;
I haue prooued them true at the last;
I dreamed in my sweauen on thursday at eueninge
in my bed wheras I lay,                                           72

"I dreamed the grype &amp; a grimlie beast
had carryed my crowne away,
my gorgett &amp; my kirtle of golde,
and all my faire heade geere;                                     76

"How he wold haue worryed me with his tush
&amp; borne me into his nest,
saving there came a litle hawk
flying out of the East,                                           80[Pg 66]
"saving there came a litle Hawke
which men call a Merlion,
vntill the ground he stroke him downe,
that dead he did fall downe.                                      84

"giffe I were a man, as I am none,
a battell I would proue,
I wold fight with that false traitor;
att him I cast my gloue!                                          88

"Seing I am able noe battell to make,
you must grant me, my leege, a Knight
to fight with that traitor, Sir Aldingar,
to maintaine me in my right."                                     92

"Ile giue thee 40 dayes," said our King,
"to seeke thee a man therin;
if thou find not a man in 40 dayes,
in a hott fyer thou shall brenn."                                 96

Our Queene sent forth a Messenger,
he rode fast into the south,
he rode the countryes through &amp; through,
soe ffar vnto Portsmouth;                                        100

he cold find never a man in the south country
that wold fight with the knight soe keene.

the second messenger the Queen forth sent,
rode far into the east,                                          104
but&mdash;blessed be God made sunn and moone!&mdash;
he sped then all of the best:

as he rode then by one riuer side,
there he mett with a litle child,                                108
he seemed noe more in a mans likenesse
then a child of 4 yeeres old;

He askt the Queenes Messenger how far he rode:
loth he was him to tell;                                         112
the litle one was offended att him,
bid him adew, farwell!

Said, "turne thou againe, thou messenger,
greete our Queene well from me;                                  116
when Bale is att hyest, boote is att next,
helpe enough there may bee![Pg 67]

"bid our queene remember what she did dreame
in her bedd wheras shee lay;                                     120
shee dreamed the grype &amp; the grimly beast
had carryed her crowne away,

"her gorgett &amp; her kirt[l]e of gold,
alsoe her faire head geere,                                      124
ne wold have werryed her with his tushe
&amp; borne her into her nest,

"Saving there came a litle hawke&mdash;
men call him a merlyon&mdash;                                         128
vntill the ground he did strike him downe,
that dead he did ffall downe.

"bidd the queene be merry att her hart,
euermore light &amp; glad,                                           132
when bale is att hyest, boote is at next,

then the Queenes Messenger rode backe,
a gladed man then was hee;                                       136
when he came before our Queene,
a gladd woman then was shee;

shee gaue the Messenger 20li:
O lord, in gold &amp; ffee,                                          140
saies, "spend &amp; spare not while this doth last,
then feitch thou more of me."

Our Queene was put in a tunne to burne,
She thought no thing but death;                                  144
th&eacute; were ware of the litle one
came ryding forth of the East

with a Mu (line cut away) ...
a louelie child was hee:                                         148
when he came to that fier,
he light the Queene full nigh;

said, "draw away these brands of fire
lie burning before our Queene,                                   152
&amp; feitch me hither Sir Aldingar
that is a knight soe keene."

When Aldingar see that litle one,
ffull litle of him hee thought,                                  156
if there had beene halfe a 100 such,
of them he wold not haue wrought.[Pg 68]

hee sayd, "come hither Sir Aldingar,
thou see-must as bigge as a ffooder!                             160
I trust to god, ere I haue done with thee,
God will send to vs anger."

saies, "the first stroke thats giuen, Sir Aldingar,
I will giue vnto thee,                                           164
&amp; if the second giue thou may,
looke then thou spare not mee."

the litle one pulld forth a well good sword,
I-wis itt was all of guilt,                                      168
it cast light there over that feild,
it shone soe all of guilt:

he stroke the first stroke att Aldingar,
he stroke away his leggs by his knee,                            172

sayes, "stand vp, stand vp, thou false traitor,
&amp; fight vpon thy feete!
"for &amp; thou thriue as thou begins,
of a height wee shalbe meete."                                   176

"A preist, a preist!" sayes Aldingar,
"me for to houzle &amp; shriue!
A preist, a preist," sayes Aldingar,
"while I am a man liuing a-liue!                                 180

"I wold haue laine by our comlie Queene;
to it shee wold neuer consent;

"there came a lame lazer to the Kings gates,
a lazar both blind &amp; lame;

"I tooke the lazar vpon my backe,

"euer alacke!" sayes Sir Aldingar,

"Now take thy wife, thou K[ing] Harry,

THE GABERLUNYIE MAN.


A Scottish Song.



  

Tradition informs us that the author of this song was
King James V. of Scotland. This prince (whose character
for wit and libertinism bears a great resemblance to
that of his gay successor, Charles II.) was noted for
strolling about his dominions in disguise,[349] and for his frequent gallantries
with country girls. Two adventures of this kind he hath
celebrated with his own pen, viz. in this ballad of The Gaberlunyie
Man; and in another intitled The Jolly Beggar, beginning thus:


"Thair was a jollie beggar, and a begging he was boun,
And he tuik up his quarters into a land'art toun.
Fa, la, la," &amp;c.


It seems to be the latter of these ballads (which was too licentious
to be admitted into this collection) that is meant in the
Catalogue of Royal and Noble Authors,[350] where the ingenious writer
remarks, that "there is something very ludicrous in the young
woman's distress when she thought her first favour had been
thrown away upon a beggar."

Bishop Tanner has attributed to James V. the celebrated ballad
of Christ's Kirk on the Green, which is ascribed to King James I.
in Bannatyne's MS. written in 1568: and, notwithstanding that
[Pg 70]authority, the editor of this book is of opinion that Bishop Tanner
was right.

King James V. died Dec. 13th, 1542, aged 33.





[James V. was called the King of the Commons, from his popular
manners and vagrant habit, and many stories are told of his adventures
when in disguise. One of these is worth relating here.
On a certain occasion he heard himself abused by a country lad
as a tyrant and a man odious in every respect, until, unable to restrain
himself, he threw off his disguise, and told his accuser that
he was the king. "Are you really the king?" said the lad, retaining
his self-possession; "weel, ye'll maybe hae heard o' my father:
he gaed daft three days regularly every year, and in a' that time
spoke naething but lies and nonsense: now I'm exactly the same
way, and this is one of my three days." There is no authority for
attributing the present song to James V., except ancient and
universal tradition. The word gaberlunyie is compounded of gaber,
a wallet, and lunyie, the loins: hence a travelling tinker or beggar
carrying a wallet by his side, was called a "gaberlunyie man."
Scott has sketched a vivid portrait of one of these privileged beggars
in his Antiquary, Edie Ochiltree, to wit. The Jolly Beggar is
printed in Herd's Scottish Songs, ii. 164, and in Ritson's Scottish
Songs, i. 168. Competent authorities are not willing to take the
credit of the authorship of Christ's Kirk on the Green from
James I. and give it to James V.]




  



The pauky auld Carle[351] came ovir the lee
Wi' mony good-eens and days to mee,
Saying, Goodwife, for your courtesie,
Will ye lodge a silly[352] poor man?
The night was cauld, the carle was wat,                              5
And down ayont the ingle[353] he sat;
My dochters shoulders he gan to clap,
And cadgily[354] ranted and sang.

O wow![355] quo he, were I as free,
As first when I saw this countrie,                                  10
How blyth and merry wad I bee!
And I wad nevir think lang.
He grew canty,[356] and she grew fain;[357][Pg 71]
But little did her auld minny ken[358]
What thir slee twa[359] togither were say'n,                        15
When wooing they were sa thrang.[360]

And O! quo he, ann ye were as black,
As evir the crown of your dadyes hat,
Tis I wad lay thee by my back,
And awa wi' me thou sould gang.                                   20
And O! quoth she, ann I were as white,
As evir the snaw lay on the dike,
Ild clead me braw,[361] and lady-like,
And awa with thee Ild gang.

Between the twa was made a plot;                                    25
They raise a wee before the cock,
And wyliely they shot the lock,
And fast to the bent are they gane.
Up the morn the auld wife raise,[362]
And at her leisure put on her claiths,                              30
Syne to the servants bed she gaes
To speir for the silly poor man.

She gaed to the bed, whair the beggar lay,
The strae was cauld, he was away,
She clapt her hands, cryd, Dulefu' day!                             35
For some of our geir will be gane.
Some ran to coffer, and some to kist,[363]
But nought was stown[364] that could be mist.
She dancid her lane,[365] cryd, Praise be blest,
I have lodgd a leal poor man.                                     40

Since naithings awa, as we can learn,[Pg 72]
The kirns to kirn,[366] and milk to earn,
Gae butt the house,[367] lass, and waken my bairn,
And bid her come quickly ben.[368]
The servant gaed where the dochter lay,                             45
The sheets was cauld, she was away,
And fast to her goodwife can say,
Shes aff with the gaberlunyie-man.

O fy gar ride, and fy gar rin,
And hast ye, find these traitors agen;                              50
For shees be burnt, and hees be slein,
The wearyfou[369] gaberlunyie-man.
Some rade upo horse, some ran a fit,
The wife was wood,[370] and out o' her wit;
She could na gang, nor yet could she sit,                           55
But ay did curse and did ban.

Mean time far hind out owre the lee,
For snug in a glen, where nane could see,
The twa, with kindlie sport and glee,
Cut frae a new cheese a whang.[371]                               60
The priving[372] was gude, it pleas'd them baith,
To lo'e her for ay, he gae her his aith.
Quo she, to leave thee, I will be laith,
My winsome gaberlunyie-man.

O kend my minny I were wi' you,                                     65
Illfardly[373] wad she crook her mou,[374]
Sic a poor man sheld nevir trow,
Aftir the gaberlunyie-mon.
My dear, quo he, yee're yet owre yonge;[Pg 73]
And hae na learnt the beggars tonge,                                70

And carrie the gaberlunyie on.

Wi' kauk and keel,[375] Ill win your bread,
And spindles and whorles[376] for them wha need,
Whilk is a gentil trade indeed                                      75

Ill bow my leg and crook my knee,
And draw a black clout owre my ee,
A criple or blind they will cau me:

XI.

ON THOMAS LORD CROMWELL.



  

It is ever the fate of a disgraced minister to be forsaken
by his friends, and insulted by his enemies, always
reckoning among the latter the giddy inconstant multitude.
We have here a spurn at fallen greatness from
one of the angry partisans of declining popery, who could never
forgive the downfall of their Diana and loss of their craft. The
ballad seems to have been composed between the time of Cromwell's
commitment to the Tower, June 10th, 1540, and that of his
being beheaded, July 28 following. A short interval! but Henry's
passion for Catharine Howard would admit of no delay. Notwithstanding
our libeller, Cromwell had many excellent qualities;
his great fault was too much obsequiousness to the arbitrary will
of his master; but let it be considered that this master had raised
him from obscurity, and that the high-born nobility had shewn
him the way in every kind of mean and servile compliance. The
original copy, printed at London in 1540, is intitled, [Pg 74]A newe
ballade made of Thomas Crumwel, called "Trolle on away." To it
is prefixed this distich by way of burthen:


"Trolle on away, trolle on awaye.
Synge heave and howe rombelowe trolle on away."


The following piece gave rise to a poetic controversy, which
was carried on thro' a succession of seven or eight ballads, written
for and against Lord Cromwell. These are all preserved in the
archives of the Antiquarian Society, in a large folio collection of
proclamations, &amp;c., made in the reigns of King Henry VIII., King
Edward VI., Queen Mary, Queen Elizabeth, King James I., &amp;c.





[Thomas Cromwell, called Malleus Monachorum, came of a
good old Lincolnshire family. He was born about the year 1490
at Putney, where his father carried on the business of an iron-founder,
which his enemies reduced to that of a blacksmith. His
father died early, and in consequence of the re-marriage of his
mother, he became a wanderer.

The author of the poor play, entitled The Life and Death of
Thomas Lord Cromwell, which has been absurdly attributed to
Shakspere, makes "old Cromwell, a blacksmith, of Putney," live to
see his son "made lord keeper."

There is a fragment of a ballad on Cromwell without any beginning
in the Folio MS. (ed. Hales and Furnivall, vol. i. p. 127),
which ends as follows:


"How now? How now? the king did say,
Thomas how is it with thee?
Hanging and drawing O King! he saide;
You shall never gett more from me."




Mr. Hales points out a coincidence not mentioned by Mr.
Froude, viz. that the minister was beheaded and the king married
to Catherine Howard on one and the same day. In 1525 Cromwell
undertook for Wolsey the work of visiting and breaking up
the small monasteries which the Pope had granted for the foundation
of Wolsey's new colleges, thus commencing the work which
gained him the enmity of the adherents of the old faith. He was
the first to cause Bibles in the English language to be deposited in
all the churches, and to him we owe the institution of parish registers.]

[Pg 75]




  



Both man and chylde is glad to here tell
Of that false traytoure Thomas Crumwell,
Now that he is set to learne to spell.

XII.

HARPALUS.


An Ancient English Pastoral.



  

This beautiful poem, which is perhaps the first attempt
at pastoral writing in our language, is preserved among
the Songs and Sonnettes of the Earl of Surrey, &amp;c., 4to.
in that part of the collection which consists of pieces
by uncertain auctours. These poems were first published in 1557,
ten years after that accomplished nobleman fell a victim to the
tyranny of Henry VIII.; but it is presumed most of them were
composed before the death of Sir Thomas Wyatt in 1541. See
Surrey's Poems, 4to. fol. 19, 49.

Tho' written perhaps near half a century before the Shepherd's
Calendar,[380] this will be found far superior to any of those eclogues,
in natural unaffected sentiments, in simplicity of style, in easy flow
of versification, and all other beauties of pastoral poetry. Spenser
ought to have profited more by so excellent a model.





[Warton describes this poem as "perhaps the first example in
our language now remaining of the pure and unmixed pastoral,
and in the erotic species for ease of numbers, elegance of rural
allusion excelling everything of the kind in Spenser, who is erroneously
ranked as our earliest English bucolic." He did not,
however, take into account Robin and Makine, which follows
Harpalus in this book, but was written more than half a century
before it. Spenser-lovers also are not likely to agree with Percy's
and Warton's summary judgments upon the Shepherd's Calendar.]

[Pg 78]




  



Phylida was a faire mayde,
As fresh as any flowre;
Whom Harpalus the herdman prayde
To be his paramour.

Harpalus, and eke Corin,                                             5
Were herdmen both yfere:[381]
And Phylida could twist and spinne,
And thereto sing full clere.

But Phylida was all t&ograve; coye,
For Harpalus to winne:                                            10
For Corin was her onely joye,
Who forst[382] her not a pinne.

How often would she flowers twine?
How often garlandes make
Of couslips and of colombine?                                       15
And al for Corin's sake.

But Corin, he had haukes to lure,
And forced more the field:[383]
Of lovers lawe he toke no cure;
For once he was begilde.                                          20

Harpalus prevailed nought,
His labour all was lost;
For he was fardest from her thought,
And yet he loved her most.

Therefore waxt he both pale and leane,                              25
And drye as clot of clay:
His fleshe it was consumed cleane;
His colour gone away.
[Pg 79]
His beard it had not long be shave;
His heare hong all unkempt:                                       30
A man most fit even for the grave,
Whom spitefull love had spent.

His eyes were red and all 'forewacht;'[384][385]
His face besprent with teares:
It semde unhap had him long 'hatcht,'                               35
In mids of his dispaires.

His clothes were blacke, and also bare;
As one forlorne was he;
Upon his head alwayes he ware
A wreath of wyllow tree.                                          40

His beastes he kept upon the hyll,
And he sate in the dale;
And thus with sighes and sorrowes shril,
He gan to tell his tale.

Oh Harpalus! (thus would he say)                                    45
Unhappiest under sunne!
The cause of thine unhappy day,
By love was first begunne.

For thou wentest first by sute to seeke
A tigre to make tame,                                             50
That settes not by thy love a leeke;
But makes thy griefe her game.

As easy it were for to convert
The frost into 'a' flame;
As for to turne a frowarde hert,                                    55
Whom thou so faine wouldst frame.
[Pg 80]
Corin he liveth car&egrave;lesse:
He leapes among the leaves:
He eates the frutes of thy redresse:[386]
Thou 'reapst,' he takes the sheaves.                              60

My beastes, a whyle your foode refraine,
And harke your herdmans sounde:
Whom spitefull love, alas! hath slaine,
Through-girt[387] with many a wounde.

O happy be ye, beast&egrave;s wilde,                                       65
That here your pasture takes:
I se that ye be not begilde
Of these your faithfull makes.[388]

The hart he feedeth by the hinde:
The bucke harde by the do:                                        70
The turtle dove is not unkinde
To him that loves her so.

The ewe she hath by her the ramme:
The yong cow hath the bull:
The calfe with many a lusty lambe                                   75
Do fede their hunger full.

But, wel-away! that nature wrought
The, Phylida, so faire:
For I may say that I have bought
Thy beauty all t&ograve; deare.                                          80

What reason is that crueltie
With beautie should have part?
Or els that such great tyranny
Should dwell in womans hart?

I see therefore to shape my death                                   85
She cruelly is prest;[389]
To th'ende that I may want my breath:
My dayes been at the best.
[Pg 81]
O Cupide, graunt this my request,
And do not stoppe thine eares;                                    90
That she may feele within her brest
The paines of my dispaires:

Of Corin 'who' is car&egrave;lesse,
That she may crave her fee:
As I have done in great distresse,                                  95
That loved her faithfully.

But since that I shal die her slave;
Her slave, and eke her thrall:[390]
Write you, my frendes, upon my grave
This chaunce that is befall.                                     100

"Here lieth unhappy Harpalus
By cruell love now slaine:
Whom Phylida unjustly thus
Hath murdred with disdaine."

ROBIN AND MAKYNE.


An Ancient Scottish Pastoral.



  

The palm of pastoral poesy is here contested by a contemporary
writer with the author of the foregoing.
The critics will judge of their respective merits; but
must make some allowance for the preceding ballad,
which is given simply as it stands in the old editions; whereas this,
which follows, has been revised and amended throughout by
Allan Ramsay, from whose Evergreen, vol. i. it is here chiefly
printed. The curious reader may, however, compare it with the
more original copy, printed among Ancient Scottish Poems, from the
[Pg 82]MS. of George Bannatyne, 1568, Edinburgh, 1770, 12mo. Mr.
Robert Henryson (to whom we are indebted for this poem) appears
to so much advantage among the writers of eclogue, that we
are sorry we can give little other account of him besides what is
contained in the following eloge, written by W. Dunbar, a Scottish
poet, who lived about the middle of the sixteenth century:


"In Dunfermline he [Death] hes done roun
Gud Maister Robert Henrisoun."


Indeed, some little further insight into the history of this Scottish
bard is gained from the title prefixed to some of his poems
preserved in the British Museum, viz. The morall Fabillis of Esop,
compylit be Maister Robert Henrisoun, scolmaister of Dumfermling,
1571. Harl. MSS. 3865, &sect; 1.

In Ramsay's Evergreen, vol. i. are preserved two other little
Doric pieces by Henryson: the one intitled The Lyon and the
Mouse, the other The garment of gude Ladyis. Some other of his
poems may be seen in the Ancient Scottish Poems, printed from
Bannatyne's MS. above referred to.





[This remarkable poem is peculiarly interesting as being the
earliest specimen of pastoral poetry in the language. Campbell
calls it "the first known pastoral, and one of the best in a dialect
rich with the favours of the pastoral muse." Langhorne writes
justly:


"In gentle Henryson's unlaboured strain
Sweet Arethusa's shepherd breath'd again."




Percy errs in describing Henryson as a contemporary of Surrey,
as the Scottish poet lived half a century before the English one.
The dates of his birth and death are not known, but he flourished
in the reign of James III. (1460-1488). "On the 10th of September,
1462, the venerable master Robert Henrysone, Licentiate in
Arts and Bachelor in Degrees, was incorporated or admitted a
member of the newly founded University of Glasgow." He was a
notary public, and probably the master of the grammar school attached
to the Abbey of Dunfermline, not as might be supposed a
mere parish schoolmaster. According to the tradition of the last
century, our poet was the representative of the family of Henryson
or Henderson, of Fordell, in the county of Fife; but Mr. David
Laing thinks that it is a gratuitous assumption to suppose that he
or his predecessors ever possessed a single acre of the lands of
Fordell.

Percy has used the version given in Ramsay's Evergreen, which
is slightly altered in diction from the original in the Bannatyne
MS.; for instance, the last stanza occurs in the latter as follows:

[Pg 83]


"Makyne went hame blyth anneuche,
Attour the holltis hair;
Robene murnit, and Makyne leuche;
Scho sang, he sichit sair
And so left him, bayth wo and wreuch,
In dolour and in cair,
Kepand his hird under a huche
Amangis the holtis hair."




In the Evergreen version, the last verse is altered to "Amang
the rushy gair," either because the words "holtis hair" occur in verse
two of the stanza, or that the Editor saw an impropriety in the close
vicinity of the similar words holt and heuch. The two words
"holtis hair" are explained as hoary hills or hoary woods, but
Finlay (Scottish Historical and Romantic Ballads, 1808, vol. ii. p. 193)
holds that "hair" really means high, and derives it from Isl. har ==
altus. He says that a high rock in some of the northern counties
of Scotland, where the dialect is strongly tinctured with Danish, is
called "hair craig," and that the same word lingers on in the Hare-stone
of the Borough Moor, Edinburgh, which obtained its name
in the following manner: The laird of Pennycuik held certain
lands by a strange tenure. He was obliged to mount a large stone
or rock, and salute the king with three blasts of a horn whenever
he passed that way. This rock or eminence was called the "Hare-stone,"
and still exists near Morningside Church. Hoary, however,
is to be understood as grey and not as white with snow, so that
the hare-stone is probably the grey stone. The word holt may
also mean a heath, and C&aelig;dmon uses the phrase "har h&aelig;&eth;" = hoar
or grey heath.

The date (1571) attached to Henryson's version of &AElig;sop's
Fables is that of transcription. It is not known when the Fables
were first printed, but they were reprinted by Robert Lekpreuik
for Henry Charteris in 1570. They are supposed to have been
written between 1470 and 1480.

Henryson wrote several other short poems, as well as the Testament
of Cresseid, written as a continuation or supplement to
Chaucer's Troilus and Cresseide, all of which have been collected
for the first time into an elegant volume by David Laing, who has
added notes and a memoir of the poet (Edinburgh, 1865).

This Testament has a particular interest for us, because Shakspere
referred to it when he wrote "Cressida was a beggar"
(Twelfth Night, act iii. sc. 1). The lines in Henryson's poem
which illustrate this passage, are as follows:


"Thair was na buit [help], bot furth with thame scho yeid
Fra place to place, quhill cauld and houngir sair
Compellit hir to be ane rank beggair."   Ll. 481-3.]

[Pg 84]



  



Robin sat on the gude grene hill,
Keipand a flock of fie,[391]
Quhen mirry[392] Makyne said him till,[393]
"O Robin rew[394] on me:
I haif thee luivt baith loud and still,[395]                         5
Thir towmonds[396] twa or thre;
My dule in dern bot gif thou dill,[397]
Doubtless but dreid Ill die."

Robin replied, Now by the rude,
Naithing of love I knaw,                                          10
But keip my sheip undir yon wod:
Lo quhair they raik on raw.[398]
Quhat can have mart[399] thee in thy mude,[400]
Thou Makyne to me schaw;
Or quhat is luve, or to be lude?[401]                               15
Fain wald I leir[402] that law.

"The law of luve gin thou wald leir,
Tak thair an A, B, C;
Be heynd,[403] courtas, and fair of feir,[404][405]
Wyse, hardy, kind and frie,                                       20
Sae that nae danger do the deir,[406][407]
Quhat dule in dern thou drie;[408]
Press ay to pleis,[409] and blyth appeir,
Be patient and privie."
[Pg 85]
Robin, he answert her againe,                                       25
I wat not quhat is luve;
But I haif marvel in certaine
Quhat makes thee thus wanrufe.[410]
The wedder is fair, and I am fain;[411]
My sheep gais hail abuve;[412]                                    30
And sould we pley us on the plain,
They wald us baith repruve.

"Robin, tak tent[413] unto my tale,
And wirk[414] all as I reid;[415]
And thou sall haif my heart all hale,                               35

Sen God, he sendis bute for bale,[416]
And for murning remeid,[417]

Doubtless I am but deid."                                         40

Makyne, to-morn be this ilk tyde,
Gif ye will meit me heir,
Maybe my sheip may gang besyde,
Quhyle we have liggd full neir;
But maugre haif I, gif I byde,[419]                                 45
Frae thay begin to steir,
Quhat lyes on heart I will nocht hyd,
Then Makyne mak gude cheir.

"Robin, thou reivs[420] me of my rest;
I luve bot thee alane."                                           50
Makyne, adieu! the sun goes west,
The day is neir-hand gane.
"Robin, in dule[421] I am so drest,[Pg 86]
That luve will be my bane."
Makyn, gae luve quhair-eir ye list,                                 55
For leman I luid nane.

"Robin, I stand in sic a style,
I sich[422] and that full sair."
Makyne, I have bene here this quyle;
At hame I wish I were.                                            60
"Robin, my hinny, talk and smyle,
Gif thou will do nae mair."
Makyne, som other man beguyle,
For hameward I will fare.

Syne Robin on his ways he went,                                     65
As light as leif on tree;
But Makyne murnt and made lament,
Scho[423] trow'd him neir to see.
Robin he brayd attowre the bent:[424]
Then Makyne cried on hie,                                         70
"Now may thou sing, for I am shent![425]
Quhat ailis luve at me?"

Makyne went hame withouten fail,
And weirylie could weip;
Then Robin in a full fair dale                                      75
Assemblit all his sheip.
Be that some part of Makyne's ail,
Out-throw his heart could creip;
Hir fast he followt to assail,
And till her tuke gude keip.[426]                                 80

Abyd, abyd, thou fair Makyne,
A word for ony thing;
For all my luve, it sall be thyne,
Withouten departing.[427]
All hale thy heart for till have myne,                              85[Pg 87]

My sheip to morn quhyle houris nyne,
Will need of nae keiping.

"Robin, thou hast heard sung and say,
In gests and storys auld,                                         90
The man that will not when he may,

I pray to heaven baith nicht and day,
Be eiked[428] their cares sae cauld,
That presses first with thee to play                                95
Be forrest, firth, or fauld."[429]

Makyne, the nicht is soft and dry,
The wether warm and fair,
And the grene wod richt neir-hand by,[430]
To walk attowre all where:                                       100
There may nae janglers[431] us espy,
That is in luve contrair;
Therin, Makyne, baith you and I
Unseen may mak repair.

"Robin, that warld is now away,                                    105
And quyt brocht till an end:
And nevir again thereto, perfay,

For of my pain thou made but play;

As thou hast done, sae sall I say,
Murn on, I think to mend."

Makyne, the hope of all my heil,[432]
My heart on thee is set;
I'll evermair to thee be leil,[433]                                115
Quhyle I may live but lett,[434]
Never to fail as uthers feill,[435][Pg 88]
Quhat grace so eir I get.
"Robin, with thee I will not deill;

Makyne went hameward blyth enough,

And so left him bayth wo and wreuch,[439]                          125
In dolor and in care,
Keipand his herd under a heuch,[440]
Amang the rushy gair.[441]

GENTLE HERDSMAN, TELL TO ME.


Dialogue Between a Pilgrim and Herdsman.



  

The scene of this beautiful old ballad is laid near Walsingham,
in Norfolk, where was anciently an image of
the Virgin Mary, famous over all Europe for the numerous
pilgrimages made to it, and the great riches it
possessed. Erasmus has given a very exact and humorous description
of the superstitions practised there in his time. See his
account of the Virgo parathalassia, in his colloquy, intitled, Peregrinatio
religionis ergo. He tells us, the rich offerings in silver,
gold, and precious stones, that were there shewn him, were incredible,
there being scarce a person of any note in England, but
what some time or other paid a visit, or sent a present to our lady
[Pg 89]of Walsingham.[442] At the dissolution of the monasteries in 1538,
this splendid image, with another from Ipswich, was carried to
Chelsea, and there burnt in the presence of commissioners; who,
we trust, did not burn the jewels and the finery.

This poem is printed from a copy in the Editor's folio MS.
which had greatly suffered by the hand of time; but vestiges of
several of the lines remaining, some conjectural supplements have
been attempted, which, for greater exactness, are in this one ballad
distinguished by italicks.[443]





[The shrine of the Virgin at Walsingham was the favourite English
resort of pilgrims for nearly four hundred years, and the people
of Norfolk were in great distress when their image was taken away
from them, and the stream of votaries was suddenly stopped. In
a copy of the Reliques in the library of the British Museum, there
is a MS. note by William Cole to the following effect: "I was
lately informed that the identical image of our lady of Walsingham
being mured up in an old wall, and there discovered on pulling
it down, was presented by the Earl of Leicester (Coke) to a
relative of his of the Roman Catholic religion."

The shrine was connected with a Priory of Augustinian Canons,
which was founded during the episcopate of William Turbus,
Bishop of Norwich (1146-1174). When Henry III. made his
pilgrimage to the shrine in the year 1241, it had long been famous,
and was probably more frequented even than the tomb of St.
Thomas a Becket at Canterbury. Foreigners of all nations came
hither on pilgrimage, and in number and quality the devotees appear
to have equalled those who toiled to the Lady of Loretto in
Italy. Several of our kings visited the shrine after Henry III.
had set the example. Edward I. was there in 1280 and in 1296,
Edward II. in 1315, and Edward IV. and his queen in 1469.
Henry VII. offered his prayers in "our Lady's Church" at Christmas
time 1486-7, and in the following summer, after the battle of
Stoke, "he sent his banner to be offered to our Lady of Walsingham,
where before he made his vows." Spelman gives on hearsay
evidence the report that Henry VIII., in the second year of his
reign, walked barefoot to Walsingham from a neighbouring village,
and then presented a valuable necklace to the image.
[Pg 90]Bartholomew, Lord Burghersh, K.G., by his will made in 1369, ordered a
statue of himself on horseback to be made in silver, and offered
to our Lady of Walsingham; and Henry VII., in his lifetime, gave
a kneeling figure of himself. There are numerous references to
Walsingham in the Paston Letters, and in 1443 we find Margaret
Paston writing to her husband to tell him that her mother had
vowed another image of wax of his own weight, to "our Lady of
Walsingham," and that she herself had vowed to go on pilgrimage
there for him. (Ed. Fenn, iii. 22.)

The total income of the place (including the offerings) was reported
to be &pound;650 in the twenty-sixth year of Henry VIII.'s
reign, and Roger Ascham, when visiting Cologne in 1550, makes
this remark: "The Three Kings be not so rich, I believe, as was
the Lady of Walsingham." Now the treasures at Cologne are
said to have been worth six millions of francs (&pound;240,000).

The road to Walsingham was a well-frequented one, and a cross
was set up in every town it passed through. An old track running
by Newmarket, Brandon, and Castle Acre, which was used by the
pilgrims, was known as the "Palmer's Way" or "Walsingham
Green Way."

The Milky Way ("the Watling-street of the heavens," as Chaucer
has it) has been associated with pilgrimages in several countries.
In Norfolk, the long streaming path of light was supposed to
point the pilgrim on his road to Walsingham, and was in consequence
called the "Walsingham Way." In Italy, in France, and
in the north of Europe it has been called "St. Jago's Way,"
"Jacobsstrasse," &amp;c., as pointing the way to Compostella, and one
of its Turkish names is "The Hadji's Way," as indicating the
road to Mecca.[444]

Among the Rawlinson MSS. in the Bodleian Library is A
Lament for Walsingham, in the handwriting of Philip, Earl of
Arundel, the third stanza of which is as follows:


"Bitter, bitter, oh! to behould
the grasse to growe
Where the walles of Walsingam
So statly did sheue.
Such were the workes of Walsingam
While shee did stand!
Such are the wrackes as now do shewe
of that holy land!
Levell, Levell with the ground
the towres doe lye."

[Pg 91]


The whole poem is printed in the Folio MS. ed. Hales and
Furnivall, vol. iii. p. 470.

The late Mr. John Gough Nichols published in 1849 a very interesting
volume, containing a translation of the Colloquy of Erasmus,
with valuable notes in illustration of it, under the following
title: "Pilgrimages to Saint Mary of Walsingham and Saint
Thomas of Canterbury, by Desiderius Erasmus, newly translated ...
and illustrated by J. G. Nichols. Westminster. 1849."
sm. 8vo. This work has lately been reprinted.

An excellent description of Walsingham Priory, with an account
of the excavations made on its site in 1853, will be found in
Henry Harrod's Gleanings among the Castles and Convents of Norfolk,
8vo. Norwich, 1857, pp. 155-197.]




  



Gentle heardsman, tell to me,
Of curtesy I thee pray,
Unto the towne of Walsingham
Which is the right and ready way.

"Unto the towne of Walsingham                                        5
The way is hard for to be gon;
And verry crooked are those pathes
For you to find out all alone."

Weere the miles doubled thrise,
And the way never soe ill,                                        10
Itt were not enough for mine offence;
Itt is soe grievous and soe ill.

"Thy yeeares are young, thy face is faire,
Thy witts are weake, thy thoughts are greene;
Time hath not given thee leave, as yett,                            15
For to committ so great a sinne."

Yes, heardsman, yes, soe woldest thou say,
If thou knewest soe much as I;
My witts, and thoughts, and all the rest,
Have well deserved for to dye.                                    20[Pg 92]

I am not what I seeme to bee,
My clothes and sexe doe differ farr:
I am a woman, woe is me!
Born[445] to greeffe and irksome care.

For my beloved, and well-beloved,                            25
My wayward cruelty could kill:
And though my teares will nought avail,
  Most dearely I bewail him still.

He was the flower of noble wights,
None ever more sincere colde bee;                          30
Of comely mien and shape hee was,
And tenderlye hee loved mee.

When thus I saw he loved me well,
I grewe so proud his paine to see,
That I, who did not know myselfe,                            35
Thought scorne of such a youth as hee.

[446]And grew soe coy and nice to please,
As women's lookes are often soe,
He might not kisse, nor hand forsooth,[Pg 93]
Unlesse I willed him soe to doe.                                  40

Thus being wearyed with delayes
To see I pittyed not his greeffe,
He gott him to a secrett place,
And there he dyed without releeffe.

And for his sake these weeds I weare,                               45
And sacriffice my tender age;
And every day Ile begg my bread,
To undergoe this pilgrimage.

Thus every day I fast and pray,
And ever will doe till I dye;                                     50
And gett me to some secrett place,
For soe did hee, and soe will I.

Now, gentle heardsman, aske no more,
But keepe my secretts I thee pray;
Unto the towne of Walsingam                                         55
Show me the right and readye way.

"Now goe thy wayes, and God before!
For he must ever guide thee still:
Turne downe that dale, the right hand path,
And soe, faire pilgrim, fare thee well!"                          60

Walsingham, I shall give a few extracts from the "Houshold-Book

[446] Three of the following stanzas have been finely paraphrased
by Dr. Goldsmith, in his charming ballad of Edwin and Emma;
the reader of taste will have a pleasure in comparing them with the
original.



"'And' still I try'd each fickle art,
Importunate and vain;
And while his passion touch'd my heart,
I triumph'd in his pain.




"'Till quite dejected with my scorn,
He left me to my pride,
And sought a solitude forlorn,
In secret, where he dy'd.




"But mine the sorrow, mine the fault,
And well my life shall pay;
I'll seek the solitude he sought,
And stretch me where he lay.




"And there forlorn despairing hid,
I'll lay me down and die:
'Twas so for me that Edwin did
And so for him will I."





[Goldsmith did not follow the last two verses, but made his
ending much more sentimental than that of the old ballad.]







XV.

K. EDWARD IV. AND TANNER OF
TAMWORTH



  

Was a story of great fame among our ancestors. The
author of the Art of English poesie, 1589, 4to, seems to
speak of it as a real fact.&mdash;Describing that vicious mode
of speech, which the Greeks called Acyron, i.e. "When
we use a dark and obscure word, utterly repugnant to that we
should express;" he adds, "Such manner of uncouth speech did
the Tanner of Tamworth use to king Edward the fourth; which
Tanner, having a great while mistaken him, and used very broad
talke with him, at length perceiving by his traine that it was the
king, was afraide he should be punished for it, [and] said thus,
with a certain rude repentance,


'I hope I shall be hanged to-morrow,'


for [I feare me] I shall be hanged; whereat the king laughed a
good,[447] not only to see the Tanner's vaine feare, but also to heare
[Pg 95]his illshapen terme: and gave him for recompence of his good
sport, the inheritance of Plumpton-parke. I am afraid," concludes
this sagacious writer, "the poets of our times that speake more
finely and correctedly, will come too short of such a reward," p. 214.&mdash;The
phrase, here referred to, is not found in this ballad at present,[448]
but occurs with some variation in another old poem, intitled John
the Reeve, described in the following volume (see the Preface to
the King and the Miller),[449] viz.


"Nay, sayd John, by Gods grace,
And Edward wer in this place,
Hee shold not touch this tonne:
He wold be wroth with John I hope,
Thereffore I beshrew the soupe,
That in his mouth shold come."   Pt. ii. st. 24.


The following text is selected (with such other corrections as
occurred) from two copies in black-letter. The one in the Bodleyan
library, intitled, "A merrie, pleasant, and delectable historie
betweene K. Edward the Fourth, and a Tanner of Tamworth, &amp;c.
printed at London, by John Danter, 1596." This copy, ancient as
it now is, appears to have been modernized and altered at the time
it was published; and many vestiges of the more ancient readings
were recovered from another copy, (though more recently printed,)
in one sheet folio, without date, in the Pepys collection.

But these are both very inferior in point of antiquity to the old
ballad of The King and the Barker, reprinted with other "Pieces
of Ancient Popular Poetry from Authentic Manuscripts and old
Printed Copies, &amp;c." Lond. 1791, 8vo. As that very antique
Poem had never occurred to the Editor of the Reliques, till he
saw it in the above collection, he now refers the curious reader to
it, as an imperfect and incorrect copy of the old original ballad.





[This ballad was a great favourite with our ancestors and is
probably of considerable antiquity.

The earliest entry of it upon the Registers of the Stationers'
Company is to William Griffith in 1564, but no such edition is
known to bibliographers. It is possible, however, that Puttenham
may have found the line quoted above&mdash;


"I hope I shall be hanged to-morrow"




in that edition.

It belongs to the large class of tales in which the sovereign is
[Pg 96]made to converse on terms of good fellowship with a humble subject.

The interesting ballad of John the Reeve referred to by Percy is
printed for the first time in Hales and Furnivall's edition of the
Folio Manuscript (vol. ii. p. 550.)

The Tanner of Tamworth is introduced into the first part of
Heywood's Edward IV. The ballad Under the greenwood tree,
among the Ashmole MSS. at Oxford, Robin Hood and the Curtal
Friar, and Robin Hood and the Monk, all begin with the same
words as this ballad&mdash;


"In summer time when leaves grow green."




The present version is an eclectic copy, polished and reversified by
Percy.]




  



In summer time, when leaves grow greene,
And blossoms bedecke the tree,
King Edward wolde a hunting ryde,
Some pastime for to see.

With hawke and hounde he made him bowne,[450]                        5
With horne, and eke with bowe;
To Drayton Basset he tooke his waye,
With all his lordes a rowe.

And he had ridden ore dale and downe
By eight of clocke in the day,                                    10
When he was ware of a bold tann&egrave;r,
Come ryding along the waye.

A fayre russet coat the tanner had on
Fast buttoned under his chin,
And under him a good cow-hide,                                      15
And a mare of four shilling.[451]
[Pg 97]
Nowe stand you still, my good lordes all,
Under the grene wood spraye;
And I will wend to yonder fellowe,
To weet[452] what he will saye.                                   20

God speede, God speede thee, said our king,
Thou art welcome, sir, sayd hee.
"The readyest waye to Drayton Basset
I praye thee to shewe to mee."

"To Drayton Basset woldst thou goe,                                 25
Fro the place where thou dost stand?
The next payre of gallowes thou comest unto,
Turne in upon thy right hand."

That is an unreadye waye, sayd our king,
Thou doest but jest I see:                                        30
Nowe shewe me out the nearest waye,
And I pray thee wend with mee.

Awaye with a vengeance! quoth the tanner:
I hold thee out of thy witt:
All daye have I rydden on Brocke my mare,                           35
And I am fasting yett.

"Go with me downe to Drayton Basset,
No daynties we will spare;
All daye shalt thou eate and drinke of the best,
And I will paye thy fare."                                        40

Gramercye[453] for nothing, the tanner replyde,
Thou payest no fare of mine:
I trowe I've more nobles in my purse,
Than thou hast pence in thine.
[Pg 98]
God give thee joy of them, sayd the king,                           45
And send them well to priefe.[454]
The tanner wolde faine have beene away,
For he weende he had beene a thiefe.

What art thou, hee sayde, thou fine fell&ograve;we,
Of thee I am in great feare,                                      50
For the cloathes, thou wearest upon thy backe,
Might beseeme a lord to weare.

I never stole them, quoth our king,
I tell you, sir, by the roode.
"Then thou playest, as many an unthrift doth,                       55
And standest in midds of thy goode."[455]

What tydinges heare you, sayd the kynge,
As you ryde farre and neare?
"I heare no tydinges, sir, by the masse,
But that cowe-hides are deare."                                   60

"Cowe-hides! cowe-hides! what things are those?
I marvell what they bee?"
What art thou a foole? the tanner reply'd;
I carry one under mee.

What craftsman art thou, said the king,                             65
I praye thee tell me trowe.
"I am a barker,[456] sir, by my trade;
Nowe tell me what art thou?"

I am a poore courtier, sir, quoth he,
That am forth of service worne;                                   70
And faine I wolde thy prentise bee,
Thy cunninge for to learne.
[Pg 99]
Marrye heaven forfend,[457] the tanner replyde,
That thou my prentise were:
Thou woldst spend more good than I shold winne                      75
By fortye shilling a yere.

Yet one thinge wolde I, sayd our king,
If thou wilt not seeme strange:
Thoughe my horse be better than thy mare,
Yet with thee I faine wold change.                                80

"Why if with me thou faine wilt change,
As change full well maye wee,
By the faith of my bodye, thou proude fell&ograve;we,
I will have some boot[458] of thee."

That were against reason, sayd the king,                            85
I sweare, so mote I thee:[459]
My horse is better than thy mare,
And that thou well mayst see.

"Yea, sir, but Brocke is gentle and mild,
And softly she will fare:                                         90
Thy horse is unrulye and wild, I wiss;
Aye skipping here and theare."

What boote wilt thou have? our king reply'd;
Now tell me in this stound.[460]
"Noe pence, nor half pence, by my faye,                             95
But a noble in gold so round."

"Here's twentye groates of white money&egrave;,
Sith thou will have it of mee."
I would have sworne now, quoth the tanner,
Thou hadst not had one penni&egrave;.                                   100
[Pg 100]
But since we two have made a change,
A change we must abide,
Although thou hast gotten Brocke my mare,
Thou gettest not my cowe-hide.

I will not have it, sayd the kynge,                                105
I sweare, so mought I thee;
Thy foule cowe-hide I wolde not beare,
If thou woldst give it to mee.

The tanner hee tooke his good cowe-hide,
That of the cow was hilt;                                        110
And threwe it upon the king's sad&egrave;lle,
That was soe fayrelye gilte.

"Now help me up, thou fine fell&ograve;we,
'Tis time that I were gone:
When I come home to Gyllian my wife,                               115
Sheel say I am a gentilmon."

The king he tooke him up by the legge;
The tanner a f ** lett fall.
Nowe marrye, good fellowe, sayd the kyng,
Thy courtesye is but small.                                      120

When the tanner he was in the kinges sad&egrave;lle,
And his foote in the stirrup was;
He marvelled greatlye in his minde,
Whether it were golde or brass.

But when his steede saw the cows taile wagge,                      125
And eke the blacke cowe-horne;
He stamped, and stared, and awaye he ranne,
As the devill had him borne.

The tanner he pulld, the tanner he sweat,
And held by the pummil fast:                                     130
At length the tanner came tumbling downe;
His necke he had well-nye brast.[461]
[Pg 101]
Take thy horse again with a vengeance, he sayd,
With mee he shall not byde.
"My horse wolde have borne thee well enoughe,                      135
But he knewe not of thy cowe-hide.

Yet if againe thou faine woldst change,
As change full well may wee,
By the faith of my bodye, thou jolly tann&egrave;r,
I will have some boote of thee."                                 140

What boote wilt thou have, the tanner replyd,
Nowe tell me in this stounde?
"Noe pence nor halfpence, sir, by my faye,
But I will have twentye pound."

"Here's twentye groates out of my purse;                           145
And twentye I have of thine:
And I have one more, which we will spend
Together at the wine."

The king set a bugle horne to his mouthe,
And blewe both loude and shrille:                                150
And soone came lords, and soone came knights,
Fast ryding over the hille.

Nowe, out alas! the tanner he cryde,
That ever I sawe this daye!
Thou art a strong thiefe, yon come thy fellowes                    155
Will beare my cowe-hide away.

They are no thieves, the king replyde,
I sweare, soe mote I thee:
But they are the lords of the north countr&egrave;y,
Here come to hunt with mee.                                      160

And soone before our king they came,
And knelt downe on the grounde:
Then might the tanner have beene awaye,
He had lever than twentye pounde.[Pg 102]

A coller, a coller, here: sayd the king,                           165
A coller he loud gan crye;
Then woulde he lever then twentye pound,
He had not beene so nighe.

A coller, a coller, the tanner he sayd,
I trowe it will breed sorrowe:                                   170
After a coller commeth a halter,
I trow I shall be hang'd to-morrowe.

Be not afraid Tanner, said our king;
I tell thee, so mought I thee,
Lo here I make thee the best esquire                               175
That is in the North countrie.[462]

For Plumpton-parke I will give thee,
With tenements faire beside:
'Tis worth three hundred markes by the yeare,
To maintaine thy good cowe-hide.                                 180

Gramercye, my liege, the tanner replyde,
For the favour thou hast me showne;
If ever thou comest to merry Tamw&ograve;rth,
Neates leather shall clout thy shoen.[463]

the imposition of a Collar. His words are, "Nor is that old
pamphlet of the Tanner of Tamworth and King Edward the
Fourth so contemptible, but that wee may thence note also an
observable passage, wherein the use of making Esquires, by giving
Collars, is expressed." (Sub Tit. Esquire; &amp; vide in Spelmanni

at this day among the Serjeants at Arms, who are invested with a
Collar (which they wear on Collar Days) by the King himself.

AS YE CAME FROM THE HOLY LAND.


Dialogue between a Pilgrim and Traveller.



  

The scene of this song is the same as in Num. XIV. The
pilgrimage to Walsingham suggested the plan of many
popular pieces. In the Pepys collection, vol. i. p. 226,
is a kind of Interlude in the old ballad style, of which
the first stanza alone is worth reprinting.


"As I went to Walsingham,
To the shrine with speede,
Met I with a jolly palmer
In a pilgrimes weede.
Now God you save, you jolly palmer!
'Welcome, lady gay,
Oft have I sued to thee for love.'
&mdash;Oft have I said you nay."


The pilgrimages undertaken on pretence of religion, were often
productive of affairs of gallantry, and led the votaries to no other
shrine than that of Venus.[464]

The following ballad was once very popular; it is quoted
in Fletcher's Knt. of the burning pestle, act ii. sc. ult. and in
another old play, called, Hans Beer-pot, his invisible Comedy,
&amp;c. 4to. 1618; act i.&mdash;The copy below was communicated to the
Editor by the late Mr. Shenstone as corrected by him from an
ancient copy, and supplied with a concluding stanza.

We have placed this, and Gentle Herdsman, &amp;c. thus early in
the volume, upon a presumption that they must have been written,
[Pg 104]if not before the dissolution of the monasteries, yet while the remembrance
of them was fresh in the minds of the people.





[Although Percy does not mention his folio MS. this song is there,
and a copy from it is now printed at the end of Percy's version.
With the exception of the last three lines there are little but verbal
differences, but these are numerous. The ending is strikingly inferior
to that of the MS. and does very little credit to Shenstone's
poetical taste. A copy of the song in the Bodleian library (MS.
Rawl. 85 fol. 124) is signed W. R., and Dr. Bliss in consequence
claimed it for Sir Walter Raleigh in his edition of Wood's Athen&aelig;.
It is inserted in the Oxford edition of Raleigh's Works, vol. viii.
p. 733, with the title&mdash;False Love and True Love. Dr. Hannah
also includes it in his edition of the Courtly Poets, but believes
it highly improbable that Raleigh wrote the song.

Mr. Chappell points out that the first line of the ballad quoted
above is introduced in Nashe's Have with you to Saffron Walden,
1596. In The Weakest goes to the Wall, 1600, we read


"King Richard's gone to Walsingham, to the Holy Land."




The tune of Walsingham was highly popular, and numerous songs
have been set to it.]




  



As ye came from the holy land
Of blessed Walsingham,
O met you not with my true love
As by the way ye came?

"How should I know your true love,                                   5
That have met many a one,
As I came from the holy land,
That have both come and gone?"

My love is neither white[466], nor browne,
But as the heavens faire;                                         10
There is none hath her form divine,
Either in earth, or ayre.
[Pg 105]
"Such an one did I meet, good sir,
With an angelicke face;
Who like a nymphe, a queene appeard                                 15
Both in her gait, her grace."

Yes: she hath cleane forsaken me,
And left me all alone;
Who some time loved me as her life,
And called me her owne.                                            20

"What is the cause she leaves thee thus,
And a new way doth take,
That some times loved thee as her life,
And thee her joy did make?"

I that loved her all my youth,                                      25
Growe old now as you see;
Love liketh not the falling fruite,
Nor yet the withered tree.

For love is like a carelesse childe,
Forgetting promise past:                                          30
He is blind, or deaf, whenere he list;
His faith is never fast.

His fond desire is fickle found,
And yieldes a trustlesse joye;
Wonne with a world of toil and care,                                35
And lost ev'n with a toye.

Such is the love of womankinde,
Or Loves faire name abusde,
Beneathe which many vaine desires,
And follyes are excusde.                                          40

But true love is a lasting fire,
[Which viewless vestals[467] tend,
That burnes for ever in the soule,
And knowes nor change, nor end.']


&#8258;
[Pg 106]






  

[The following version is reprinted from the Folio MS.

"Shee hath left me heere alone,

who sometime loued me as her liffe
and called me her owne."                                          20

"I haue loued her all my youth,

XVII.

HARDYKNUTE.


A Scottish Fragment.



  

As this fine morsel of heroic poetry hath generally past for
ancient, it is here thrown to the end of our earliest
pieces; that such as doubt of its age, may the better
compare it with other pieces of genuine antiquity. For
after all, there is more than reason to suspect, that it owes most
of its beauties (if not its whole existence) to the pen of a lady,
within the present century. The following particulars may be
depended on. Mrs. Wardlaw, whose maiden name was Halket
(aunt to the late Sir Peter Halket, of Pitferran, in Scotland,
who was killed in America, along with general Bradock, in
1755), pretended she had found this poem, written on shreds of
paper, employed for what is called the bottoms of clues. A suspicion
arose that it was her own composition. Some able judges
asserted it to be modern. The lady did in a manner acknowledge
it to be so. Being desired to shew an additional stanza, as a proof
of this, she produced the 2 last beginning with "There's nae light,"
&amp;c. which were not in the copy that was first printed. The late
Lord President Forbes, and Sir Gilbert Elliot of Minto (late Lord
Justice Clerk for Scotland) who had believed it ancient, contributed
to the expence of publishing the first edition, in folio, 1719.&mdash;This
account was transmitted from Scotland by Sir David Dalrymple,
the late Lord Hailes, who yet was of opinion, that part of
the ballad may be ancient; but retouched and much enlarged by
the lady abovementioned. Indeed he had been informed, that the
late William Thomson, the Scottish musician, who published the
Orpheus Caledonius, 1733, 2 vols. 8vo. declared he had heard[Pg 108]
fragments of it repeated in his infancy, before Mrs. Wardlaw's
copy was heard of.

The poem is here printed from the original edition, as it was
prepared for the press with the additional improvements.

In an elegant publication, intitled, Scottish Tragic Ballads,
printed by and for J. Nichols, 1781, 8vo. may be seen a continuation
of the Ballad of Hardyknute, by the addition of a Second Part,
which hath since been acknowledged to be his own composition,
by the ingenious Editor [John Pinkerton]&mdash;To whom the late Sir
D. Dalrymple communicated (subsequent to the account drawn up
above) extracts of a letter from Sir John Bruce, of Kinross, to Lord
Binning, which plainly proves the pretended discoverer of the fragment
of Hardyknute to have been Sir John Bruce himself. His
words are, "To perform my promise, I send you a true copy of
the Manuscript I found some weeks ago in a vault at Dumferline.
It is written on vellum in a fair Gothic character, but so much
defaced by time, as you'll find that the tenth part is not legible."
He then gives the whole fragment as it was first published in 1719,
save one or two stanzas, marking several passages as having
perished by being illegible in the old MS. Hence it appears,
that Sir John was the author of Hardyknute, but afterwards used
Mrs. Wardlaw to be the midwife of his poetry, and suppressed the
story of the vault; as is well observed by the Editor of the Tragic
Ballads, and of Maitland's Scot. Poets, vol. i. p. cxxvii.

To this gentleman we are indebted for the use of the copy,
whence the second edition was afterwards printed, as the same
was prepared for the press by John Clerk, M.D. of Edinburgh, an
intimate companion of Lord President Forbes.

The title of the first edition was, "Hardyknute, a Fragment.
Edinburgh, printed for James Watson, &amp;c. 1719," folio, 12 pages.

Stanzas not in the first edition are, Nos. 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23,

The Editor was also informed, on the authority of Dr. David
Clerk, M.D. of Edinburgh (son of the aforesaid Dr. John Clerk),[Pg 109]
that between the present stanzas 36 and 37, the two following had
been intended, but were on maturer consideration omitted, and do
not now appear among the MS. additions:


"Now darts flew wavering through slaw speed,
Scarce could they reach their aim;
Or reach'd, scarce blood the round point drew,
'Twas all but shot in vain:
Right strengthy arms forfeebled grew,
Sair wreck'd wi' that day's toils:
E'en fierce-born minds now lang'd for peace,
And curs'd war's cruel broils.

"Yet still wars horns sounded to charge,
Swords clash'd and harness rang;
But saftly sae ilk blaster blew
The hills and dales fraemang.
Nae echo heard in double dints,
Nor the lang-winding horn,
Nae mair she blew out brade as she
Did eir that summers morn."






[Elizabeth Halket, second daughter of Sir Charles Halket of
Pitfirrane, Fife, and wife of Sir Henry Wardlaw of Pitrivie, Fife
and Balmulie near Dunfermline, who was born in the year 1677,
married in 1696, and died in 1727, is now known to have been
the authoress of Hardyknute, although it was many years before
the question of the authorship was finally settled.

Mr. David Laing once possessed a copy of this ballad printed
in a duodecimo of eight pages without date, which is supposed to
be the original edition. Besides various differences, some important
and others minute, it does not contain stanzas 27, 28 and
40, which are printed in the folio of 1719. It was reprinted several
times before Percy included it in his book, and its antiquity does
not seem to have been doubted, for the editor of the edition of
1740 speaks of it as a specimen of the true sublime, and believes
that "it can only be the work of an author highly smitten with
the fury of a poetical genius." Allan Ramsay's Evergreen, 1724,
vol. ii. contains this ballad with the twelve additional stanzas noted
above by Percy.

When Percy first printed the ballad suspicions of its authenticity
had been expressed, which soon led to the discovery of the writer, but
after having stated who was the real author, he threw doubts upon his
statement on account of Pinkerton's truthless report. Pinkerton was
never to be depended upon, and he had previously affirmed that
the common people of Lanarkshire "repeat scraps of both parts,"
although the second was his own composition. Sir John Hope Bruce[Pg 110]
had nothing to do with the composition of the ballad, and it is even
doubtful whether his supposed letter to Lord Binning ever had
any existence. If it had, it was merely a mystification. On the
second of December, 1785, Lord Hailes wrote to Pinkerton as
follows, "You mistook if you suppose that I reckoned Sir John
Bruce to be the author of Hardyknute. It is his sister-in-law, Lady
Wardlaw, who is said to have been the author." Yet Pinkerton
made Percy believe that Bruce was the author. Great difference
of opinion has been expressed as to the merit of the ballad by
various critics. Mathias was fascinated with it, and printed it
privately with an encomiastic criticism. Scott wrote on the fly-leaf
of his copy of Ramsay's Evergreen, "Hardyknute was the first
poem I ever learnt&mdash;the last that I shall forget," and in his Minstrelsy
of the Border he terms it "a most spirited and beautiful
imitation of the ancient ballad." Thomas Warton was deceived by
it, and describes it as genuine in the first edition of his Observations
on Spenser. In the second edition he assigns the ballad to its true
author, but adds, "I am apt to think that the first stanza is old
and gave the hint for writing the rest." On the other side Dr.
Johnson considered it to have "no great merit," and Aytoun
esteemed it a very poor performance. It has not been popular
with the ordinary devourers of ballads, and Mr. James Maidment
never had the good luck to pick up a stall copy&mdash;he writes, "The
flying stationers, the best judges of what suited their customers,
not considering it an eligible republication." The ballad is supposed
to refer to the battle of Largs, fought on the second of
October, 1263, between the invading force led by Haco, King
of Norway, and the Scottish army commanded in person by
Alexander III., but it would, in fact, suit any conflict between
Scots and Northmen. The effect of this battle was the loss to
Scandinavia of the Hebrides and the Isle of Man, which dependencies
were relinquished to Alexander III. by terms of a treaty
concluded in 1266, with Magnus, the successor of Haco. The
victory was largely due to the Lord High Steward of Scotland,
who is supposed to be represented by Hardyknute. Mr. Gilfillan
notes that "Fairly Castle, the residence of Hardyknute,
stands three miles south of the battle field. It is a single square
tower, by the side of a wild stream tumbling over a rock into a
deep ravine."]

Stately stept he east the wa',[468]
And stately stept he west,
Full seventy years he now had seen,
Wi' scarce seven years of rest.
He liv'd when Britons breach of faith                                5
Wrought Scotland mickle wae:
And ay his sword tauld to their cost,
He was their deadlye fae.


II.



High on a hill his castle stood,
With ha's[469] and tow'rs a height,                               10
And goodly chambers fair to se,
Where he lodged mony a knight.
His dame sae peerless anes and fair,
For chast and beauty deem'd,
Nae marrow[470] had in all the land,                                15
Save Elenor[471] the queen.


III.



Full thirteen sons to him she bare,
All men of valour stout;
In bloody fight with sword in hand
Nine lost their lives bot[472] doubt:                             20
Four yet remain, lang may they live
To stand by liege and land;
High was their fame, high was their might,
And high was their command.

[Pg 112]
IV.



Great love they bare to Fairly fair,                                25
Their sister saft and dear,
Her girdle shaw'd her middle gimp,[473]
And gowden glist[474] her hair.
What waefu' wae her beauty bred?
Waefu' to young and auld,                                         30
Waefu' I trow to kyth and kin,
As story ever tauld.


V.



The king of Norse in summer tyde,
Puff'd up with pow'r and might,
Landed in fair Scotland the isle                                    35
With mony a hardy knight.
The tydings to our good Scots king
Came, as he sat at dine,
With noble chiefs in brave aray,
Drinking the blood-red wine.                                      40


VI.



"To horse, to horse, my royal liege,
Your faes stand on the strand,
Full twenty thousand glittering spears
The king of Norse commands."
Bring me my steed Mage dapple gray,                                 45
Our good king rose and cry'd,
A trustier beast in a' the land
A Scots king nevir try'd.


VII.



Go little page, tell Hardyknute,
That lives on hill sae hie,                                       50
To draw his sword, the dread of faes,
And haste and follow me.
The little page flew swift as dart[Pg 113]
Flung by his master's arm,
"Come down, come down, lord Hardyknute,                             55
And rid your king frae harm."


VIII.



Then red red grew his dark-brown cheeks,
Sae did his dark-brown brow;
His looks grew keen, as they were wont
In dangers great to do;                                           60
He's ta'en a horn as green as grass,
And gi'en five sounds sae shill,[475]
That trees in green wood shook thereat,
Sae loud rang ilka hill.


IX.



His sons in manly sport and glee,                                   65
Had past that summer's morn,
When low down in a grassy dale,
They heard their father's horn.
That horn, quo' they, ne'er sounds in peace,
We've other sport to bide.                                        70
And soon they hy'd them up the hill,
And soon were at his side.


X.



"Late late the yestreen[476] I ween'd in peace
To end my lengthened life,
My age might well excuse my arm                                     75
Frae manly feats of strife;
But now that Norse do's proudly boast
Fair Scotland to inthrall,
It's ne'er be said of Hardyknute,
He fear'd to fight or fall.                                       80

[Pg 114]
XI.



"Robin of Rothsay, bend thy bow
Thy arrows shoot sae leel,[477]
That mony a comely countenance
They've turnd to deadly pale.
Brade[478] Thomas take you but your lance,                          85
You need nae weapons mair,
If you fight wi't as you did anes
'Gainst Westmoreland's fierce heir.


XII.



"And Malcolm, light of foot as stag
That runs in forest wild,                                         90
Get me my thousands three of men
Well bred to sword and shield:
Bring me my horse and harnisine,[479]
My blade of mettal clear.
If faes but ken'd the hand it bare,                                 95
They soon had fled for fear.


XIII.



"Farewell my dame sae peerless good,
(And took her by the hand),
Fairer to me in age you seem,
Than maids for beauty fam'd.                                     100
My youngest son shall here remain
To guard these stately towers,
And shut the silver bolt that keeps
Sae fast your painted bowers."


XIV.



And first she wet her comely cheiks,                               105
And then her boddice green,
Her silken cords of twirtle twist,[480]
Well plett with silver sheen;
And apron set with mony a dice[Pg 115]
Of needle-wark sae rare,                                         110
Wove by nae hand, as ye may guess,
Save that of Fairly fair.


XV.



And he has ridden o'er muir and moss,
O'er hills and mony a glen,
When he came to a wounded knight                                   115
Making a heavy mane;
"Here maun I lye, here maun I dye,
By treacherie's false guiles;
Witless I was that e'er ga faith
To wicked woman's smiles."                                       120


XVI.



"Sir knight, gin you were in my bower,
To lean on silken seat,
My lady's kindly care you'd prove,
Who ne'er knew deadly hate:
Herself wou'd watch you a' the day,                                125
Her maids a dead of night;
And Fairly fair your heart wou'd chear,
As she stands in your sight.


XVII.



"Arise young knight, and mount your stead,
Full lowns the shynand day:[481]                                 130
Choose frae my menzie[482] whom ye please
To lead you on the way."
With smileless look, and visage wan
The wounded knight reply'd,
"Kind chieftain, your intent pursue,                               135
For here I maun abyde.

[Pg 116]
XVIII.



To me nae after day nor night
Can e're be sweet or fair,
But soon beneath some draping tree,
Cauld death shall end my care."                                  140
With him nae pleading might prevail;
Brave Hardyknute to gain
With fairest words, and reason strong,
Strave courteously in vain.


XIX.



Syne he has gane far hynd out o'er[483]                            145
Lord Chattan's land sae wide;
That lord a worthy wight was ay,
When faes his courage sey'd:[484]
Of Pictish race by mother's side,
When Picts rul'd Caledon,                                        150
Lord Chattan claim'd the princely maid,
When he sav'd Pictish crown.


XX.



Now with his fierce and stalwart train,
He reach'd a rising hight,
Quhair braid encampit on the dale,                                 155
Norss menzie[485] lay in sicht.
"Yonder my valiant sons and feirs[486]
Our raging revers[487] wait
On the unconquert Scottish sward
To try with us their fate.                                       160


XXI.



"Make orisons to him that sav'd
Our sauls upon the rude;[488]
Syne[489] bravely shaw your veins are fill'd
With Caledonian blude."
Then furth he drew his trusty glave,[490]                          165[Pg 117]
While thousands all around
Drawn frae their sheaths glanc'd in the sun;
And loud the bougles sound.


XXII.



To joyn his king adoun the hill
In hast his merch he made,                                       170
While, playand pibrochs, minstralls meit[491]
Afore him stately strade.
"Thrice welcome valiant stoup of weir,[492]
Thy nations shield and pride;
Thy king nae reason has to fear                                    175
When thou art by his side."


XXIII.



When bows were bent and darts were thrawn;
For thrang scarce cou'd they flee;
The darts clove arrows as they met,
The arrows dart[493] the tree.                                   180
Lang did they rage and fight fu' fierce,
With little skaith to mon,
But bloody bloody was the field,
Ere that lang day was done.


XXIV.



The king of Scots, that sindle[494] brook'd                        185
The war that look'd like play,
Drew his braid sword, and brake his bow,
Sin bows seem'd but delay.
Quoth noble Rothsay, "Mine I'll keep,
I wat it's bled a score."                                        190
Haste up my merry men, cry'd the king,
As he rode on before.

[Pg 118]
XXV.



The king of Norse he sought to find,
With him to mense[495] the faught,
But on his forehead there did light                                195
A sharp unsonsie[496] shaft;
As he his hand put up to feel
The wound, an arrow keen,
O waefu' chance! there pinn'd his hand
In midst between his een.                                        200


XXVI.



"Revenge, revenge, cry'd Rothsay's heir,
Your mail-coat sha' na bide
The strength and sharpness of my dart:"
Then sent it through his side.
Another arrow well he mark'd,                                      205
It pierc'd his neck in twa,
His hands then quat[497] the silver reins,
He low as earth did fa'.


XXVII.



"Sair bleids my liege, sair, sair he bleeds!"
Again wi' might he drew                                          210
And gesture dread his sturdy bow,
Fast the braid arrow flew:
Wae to the knight he ettled at;[498]
Lament now queen Elgreed;
High dames too wail your darling's fall,                           215
His youth and comely meed.


XXVIII.



"Take aff, take aff his costly jupe[499]
(Of gold well was it twin'd,
Knit like the fowler's net, through quhilk,
His steelly harness shin'd)                                      220
Take, Norse, that gift frae me, and bid[Pg 119]
Him venge the blood it bears;
Say, if he face my bended bow,
He sure nae weapon fears."


XXIX.



Proud Norse with giant body tall,                                  225
Braid shoulders and arms strong,
Cry'd, "Where is Hardyknute sae fam'd,
And fear'd at Britain's throne:
Tho' Britons tremble at his name,
I soon shall make him wail,                                      230
That e'er my sword was made sae sharp,
Sae saft his coat of mail."


XXX.



That brag his stout heart cou'd na bide,
It lent him youthfu' micht:
"I'm Hardyknute; this day, he cry'd,                               235
To Scotland's king I heght[500]
To lay thee low, as horses hoof;
My word I mean to keep."
Syne with the first stroke e'er he strake,
He garr'd[501] his body bleed.                                   240


XXXI.



Norss' een like gray gosehawk's stair'd wyld,
He sigh'd wi' shame and spite;
"Disgrac'd is now my far-fam'd arm
That left thee power to strike:"
Then ga' his head a blow sae fell,                                 245
It made him doun to stoup,
As laigh as he to ladies us'd
In courtly guise to lout.[502]

[Pg 120]
XXXII.



Fu' soon he rais'd his bent body,
His bow he marvell'd sair,                                       250
Sin blows till then on him but darr'd[503]
As touch of Fairly fair:
Norse marvell'd too as sair as he
To see his stately look;
Sae soon as e'er he strake a fae,                                  255
Sae soon his life he took.


XXXIII.



Where like a fire to heather set,
Bauld Thomas did advance,
Ane sturdy fae with look enrag'd
Up toward him did prance;                                        260
He spurr'd his steid through thickest ranks
The hardy youth to quell,
Wha stood unmov'd at his approach
His fury to repell.


XXXIV.



"That short brown shaft sae meanly trimm'd,                        265
Looks like poor Scotlands gear,
But dreadfull seems the rusty point!"
And loud he leugh in jear.[504]
"Oft Britons b[l]ood has dimm'd its shine;
This point cut short their vaunt:"                               270
Syne pierc'd the boasters bearded cheek;
Nae time he took to taunt.


XXXV.



Short while he in his saddle swang,
His stirrup was nae stay,
Sae feeble hang his unbent knee                                    275
Sure taiken he was fey:[505]
Swith[506] on the harden't clay he fell,[Pg 121]
Right far was heard the thud:
But Thomas look't nae as he lay
All waltering in his blud.


XXXVI.



With careless gesture, mind unmov't,
On rode he north the plain;
His seem in throng of fiercest strife,
When winner ay the same:
Not yet his heart dames dimplet cheek                              285
Could mease[507] soft love to bruik,
Till vengefu' Ann return'd his scorn,
Then languid grew his luik.


XXXVII.



In thraws of death, with walowit[508] cheik
All panting on the plain,                                        290
The fainting corps of warriours lay,
Ne're to arise again;
Ne're to return to native land,
Nae mair with blithsome sounds
To boast the glories of the day,                                   295
And shaw their shining wounds.


XXXVIII.



On Norways coast the widowit dame
May wash the rocks with tears,
May lang luik ow'r the shipless seas
Befor her mate appears.                                          300
Cease, Emma, cease to hope in vain;
Thy lord lyes in the clay;
The valiant Scots nae revers thole[509]
To carry life away.

[Pg 122]
XXXIX.



Here on a lee, where stands a cross                                305
Set up for monument,
Thousands fu' fierce that summer's day
Fill'd keen war's black intent.
Let Scots, while Scots, praise Hardyknute,
Let Norse the name ay dread,                                     310
Ay how he faught, aft how he spar'd,
Shall latest ages read.


XL.



Now loud and chill blew th' westlin wind,
Sair beat the heavy shower,
Mirk[510] grew the night ere Hardyknute                            315
Wan[511] near his stately tower.
His tow'r that us'd wi' torches blaze
To shine sae far at night,
Seem'd now as black as mourning weed,
Nae marvel sair he sigh'd.                                       320


XLI.



"There's nae light in my lady's bower,
There's nae light in my ha';
Nae blink shines round my Fairly fair,
Nor ward[512] stands on my wa'."
"What bodes it? Robert, Thomas, say;"&mdash;                            325
Nae answer fitts their dread.
"Stand back, my sons, I'le be your guide;"
But by they past with speed.

[Pg 123]

I.

A BALLAD OF LUTHER, THE POPE, A
CARDINAL, AND A HUSBANDMAN.



  

In the former Book we brought down this second Series
of poems, as low as about the middle of the sixteenth
century. We now find the Muses deeply engaged in
religious controversy. The sudden revolution, wrought
in the opinions of mankind by the Reformation, is one of the most
striking events in the history of the human mind. It could not
but engross the attention of every individual in that age, and
therefore no other writings would have any chance to be read, but
such as related to this grand topic. The alterations made in the
established religion by Henry VIII., the sudden changes it underwent
in the three succeeding reigns within so short a space as
eleven or twelve years, and the violent struggles between expiring
Popery, and growing Protestantism, could not but interest all mankind.
Accordingly every pen was engaged in the dispute. The
followers of the Old and New Profession (as they were called) had
their respective Ballad-makers; and every day produced some
popular sonnet for or against the Reformation. The following ballad,
and that intitled Little John Nobody, may serve for specimens of
the writings of each party. Both were written in the reign of Edward
VI.; and are not the worst that were composed upon the
occasion. Controversial divinity is no friend to poetic flights.
Yet this ballad of Luther and the Pope is not altogether devoid
of spirit; it is of the dramatic kind, and the characters are tolerably
well sustained; especially that of Luther, which is made to speak
in a manner not unbecoming the spirit and courage of that vigorous
Reformer. It is printed from the original black-letter copy (in the
Pepys collection, vol. i. folio,) to which is prefixed a large wooden
cut, designed and executed by some eminent master.

[Pg 128]

We are not to wonder that the ballad-writers of that age should
be inspired with the zeal of controversy, when the very stage
teemed with polemic divinity. I have now before me two very
ancient quarto black-letter plays: the one published in the time
of Henry VIII., intitled, Every Man; the other called Lusty
Juventus, printed in the reign of Edward VI. In the former of
these, occasion is taken to inculcate great reverence for old mother
church and her superstitions:[513] in the other, the poet (one R. Wever)
with great success attacks both. So that the Stage in those days
literally was, what wise men have always wished it, a supplement
to the pulpit:&mdash;This was so much the case, that in the play of
Lusty Juventus, chapter and verse are every where quoted as
formally as in a sermon; take an instance:


"The Lord by his prophet Ezechiel sayeth in this wise playnlye,
As in the xxxiij chapter it doth appere:
Be converted, O ye children, &amp;c."


From this play we learn that most of the young people were New
Gospellers, or friends to the Reformation; and that the old were
tenacious of the doctrines imbibed in their youth: for thus the
Devil is introduced lamenting the downfal of superstition:
[Pg 129]

"The olde people would believe stil in my lawes,
But the yonger sort leade them a contrary way,
They wyl not beleve, they playnly say,
In olde traditions, and made by men, &amp;c."


And in another place Hypocrisy urges,


"The worlde was never meri
Since chyldren were so boulde:
Now every boy will be a teacher,
The father a foole, the chyld a preacher."


Of the plays abovementioned, to the first is subjoined the following
Printer's Colophon, &para; Thus endeth this moral playe of Every Man,
&para; Imprynted at London in Powles chyrche yarde by me John
Skot. In Mr. Garrick's collection is an imperfect copy of the same
play, printed by Richarde Pynson.

The other is intitled, An enterlude called Lusty Juventus: and is
thus distinguished at the end: Finis. quod R. Wever. Imprinted
at London in Paules churche yeard, by Abraham Vele at the signe
of the Lambe. Of this too Mr. Garrick has an imperfect copy of a
different edition.

Of these two plays the reader may find some further particulars
in the former volume, Appendix II., see The Essay on the Origin of
the English Stage; and the curious reader will find the plays
themselves printed at large in Hawkins's Origin of the English
Drama, 3 vols. Oxford, 1773, 12mo.



The Husbandman.



  



Let us lift up our hartes all,
And prayse the lordes magnificence
Which hath given the wolues a fall,
And is become our strong defence:
For they thorowe a false pretens
From Christes bloude dyd all us leade,[514]                          5
Gettynge from every man his pence,
As satisfactours for the deade.
[Pg 130]
For what we with our Flayles coulde get
To kepe our house, and servauntes;                                10
That did the Freers[515] from us fet,
And with our soules played the merchauntes:
And thus they with theyr false warrantes
Of our sweate have easelye lyved,
That for fatnesse theyr belyes pantes,                            15
So greatlye have they us deceaued.

They spared not the fatherlesse,
The carefull, nor the pore wydowe;
They wolde have somewhat more or lesse,
If it above the ground did growe:                                 20
But now we Husbandmen do knowe
Al their subteltye, and their false caste;[516]
For the lorde hath them overthrowe
With his swete word now at the laste.


Doctor Martin Luther.



Thou antichrist, with thy thre crownes,                             25
Hast usurped kynges powers,
As having power over realmes and townes,
Whom thou oughtest to serve all houres:
Thou thinkest by thy jugglyng colours
Thou maist lykewise Gods word oppresse;                             30
As do the deceatful foulers,
When they theyr nettes craftelye dresse.

Thou flatterest every prince, and lord,
Thretening poore men with swearde and fyre;
All those, that do followe Gods worde,                              35
To make them cleve to thy desire,
Theyr bokes thou burnest in flaming fire;
Cursing with boke, bell, and candell,
Such as to reade them have desyre,
Or with them are wyllynge to meddell.                               40
[Pg 131]
Thy false power wyl I bryng down,
Thou shalt not raygne many a yere,
I shall dryve the from citye and towne,
Even with this PEN that thou seyste here:
Thou fyghtest with swerd, shylde, and speare,                     45
But I wyll fyght with Gods worde;
Which is now so open and cleare,
That it shall brynge the under the borde.[517]


The Pope.



Though I brought never so many to hel,
And to utter dampnacion,                                          50
Throughe myne ensample, and consel,
Or thorow any abhominacion,
Yet doth our lawe excuse my fashion.
And thou, Luther, arte accursed;
For blamynge me, and my condicion,                                55
The holy decres have the condempned.

Thou stryvest against my purgatory,
Because thou findest it not in scripture;
As though I by myne auctorite
Myght not make one for myne honoure.                              60
Knowest thou not, that I have power
To make, and mar, in heaven and hell,
In erth, and every creature?
Whatsoever I do it must be well.

As for scripture, I am above it;                                    65
Am not I Gods hye vicare?
Shulde I be bounde to folowe it,
As the carpenter his ruler?[518]
Nay, nay, hereticks ye are,
That will not obey my auctoritie.                                   70
With this SWORDE I wyll declare,
That ye shal al accursed be.


[Pg 132]

The Cardinal.



I am a Cardinall of Rome,
Sent from Christes hye vicary,
To graunt pardon to more, and sume,                                 75
That wil Luther resist strongly:
He is a greate hereticke treuly,
And regardeth to much the scripture;
For he thinketh onely thereby
To subdue the popes high honoure.                                   80

Receive ye this PARDON devoutely,
And loke that ye agaynst him fight;
Plucke up youre herts, and be manlye,
For the pope sayth ye do but ryght:
And this be sure, that at one flyghte,                            85
Allthough ye be overcome by chaunce,
Ye shall to heaven go with greate myghte;
God can make you no resistaunce.

But these heretikes for their medlynge
Shall go down to hel every one;                                   90
For they have not the popes blessynge,
Nor regarde his holy pard&ograve;n:
They thinke from all destruction
By Christes bloud to be saved,
Fearynge not our excommunicacion,                                 95
Therefore shall they al be dampned.

II.

JOHN ANDERSON MY JO.


A Scottish Song.



  

While in England verse was made the vehicle of controversy,
and popery was attacked in it by logical
argument, or stinging satire; we may be sure the zeal
of the Scottish Reformers would not suffer their pens
to be idle, but many a pasquil was discharged at the Romish
priests, and their enormous encroachments on property. Of this
kind perhaps is the following, (preserved in Maitland's MS. Collection
of Scottish poems in the Pepysian library:)


"Tak a Wobster, that is leill,
And a Miller, that will not steill,
With ane Priest, that is not gredy,
And lay ane deid corpse thame by,
And, throw virtue of thame three,
That deid corpse sall qwyknit be."


Thus far all was fair: but the furious hatred of popery led them
to employ their rhymes in a still more licentious manner. It is a
received tradition in Scotland, that at the time of the Reformation,
ridiculous and obscene songs were composed to be sung by the
rabble to the tunes of the most favourite hymns in the Latin service.
Green sleeves and pudding pies (designed to ridicule the
popish clergy) is said to have been one of these metamorphosed
hymns: Maggy Lauder was another: John Anderson my jo was a
third. The original music of all these burlesque sonnets was very
fine. To give a specimen of their manner, we have inserted one
of the least offensive. The reader will pardon the meanness of
the composition for the sake of the anecdote, which strongly marks
the spirit of the times.

In the present Edition this song is much improved by some
new readings communicated by a friend; who thinks by the
"Seven Bairns," in st. 2d. are meant the Seven Sacraments; five
of which were the spurious offspring of Mother Church: as the
first stanza contains a satirical allusion to the luxury of the popish
clergy.

The adaptation of solemn church music to these ludicrous pieces[Pg 134]
and the jumble of ideas thereby occasioned, will account for the
following fact.&mdash;From the Records of the General Assembly in
Scotland, called, The Book of the Universal Kirk, p. 90, 7th
July, 1568, it appears, that Thomas Bassendyne printer in Edinburgh,
printed "a psalme buik, in the end whereof was found
printit ane baudy sang, called, Welcome Fortunes."[519]





[In the first edition of the Reliques the number of the bairns is
fixed at five instead of seven, and the rhyme to five is thrive instead
of threven. The last line is


"For four of them were gotten, quhan Willie was awa."




The present copy has thus been altered to support the untenable
position that the seven bairns were meant to represent the seven
sacraments.

According to tradition John Anderson was formerly the town
crier of Kelso, and the song is not of any great antiquity, for it is
first found in the Skene MS., the date of which Dauney (Ancient
Scottish Melodies, p. 219) fixes at the beginning of the seventeenth
century, but which includes, according to Mr. Chappell, an English
country dance that first appeared in 1698 (Popular Music of the
Olden Time, vol. ii. p. 770).

Burns wrote his song&mdash;


"John Anderson my jo John
When we were first acquent,"




to the old tune, for Johnson's Musical Museum.]



Woman.



  



John Anderson my jo, cum in as ye gae bye,
And ye sall get a sheips heid weel baken in a pye;
Weel baken in a pye, and the haggis in a pat:
John Anderson my jo, cum in, and ye's get that.

[Pg 135]

And how doe ye, Cummer?[520] and how hae ye threven?
And how mony bairns hae ye? Wom. Cummer, I hae seven.

For five of tham were gotten, quhan he was awa.'

III.

LITTLE JOHN NOBODY.



  

We have here a witty libel on the Reformation under
king Edward VI. written about the year 1550, and preserved
in the Pepys collection, British Museum, and
Strype's Mem. of Cranmer. The author artfully declines
entering into the merits of the cause, and wholly reflects on the lives
and actions of many of the Reformed. It is so easy to find flaws and
imperfections in the conduct of men, even the best of them, and
still easier to make general exclamations about the profligacy of
the present times, that no great point is gained by arguments
of that sort, unless the author could have proved that the principles
of the Reformed Religion had a natural tendency to produce
a corruption of manners: whereas he indirectly owns,
that their reverend father [archbishop Cranmer] had used the
most proper means to stem the torrent, by giving the people
access to the Scriptures, by teaching them to pray with understanding,
and by publishing homilies, and other religious tracts.
It must however be acknowledged, that our libeller had at that
time sufficient room for just satire. For under the banners of the
Reformed had enlisted themselves, many concealed papists, who
had private ends to gratify; many that were of no religion; many
greedy courtiers, who thirsted after the possessions of the church;
and many dissolute persons, who wanted to be exempt from all
ecclesiastical censures. And as these men were loudest of all
others in their cries for Reformation, so in effect, none obstructed
the regular progress of it so much, or by their vicious lives brought
[Pg 136]vexation and shame more on the truly venerable and pious Reformers.

The reader will remark the fondness of our satirist for alliteration:
in this he was guilty of no affectation or singularity; his
versification is that of Pierce Plowman's Visions, in which a recurrence
of similar letters is essential: to this he has only superadded
rhyme, which in his time began to be the general practice. See
an Essay on this very peculiar kind of metre, in the appendix to
this Volume.




  



In december, when the dayes draw to be short,
After november, when the nights wax noysome and long;
As I past by a place privily at a port,
I saw one sit by himself making a song:
His last[521] talk of trifles, who told with his tongue
That few were fast i'th' faith. I 'freyned'[522] that freake,[523]
Whether he wanted wit, or some had done him wrong.
He said, he was little John Nobody, that durst not speake.

John Nobody, quoth I, what news? thou soon note and tell
What maner men thou meane, thou are so mad.
He said, These gay gallants, that wil construe the gospel,
As Solomon the sage, with semblance full sad;
To discusse divinity they nought adread;
More meet it were for them to milk kye at a fleyke.[524]
Thou lyest, quoth I, thou losel,[525] like a leud lad.
He said, he was little John Nobody, that durst not speake.
[Pg 137]
Its meet for every man on this matter to talk,
And the glorious gospel ghostly to have in mind;
It is sothe said, that sect but much unseemly skalk,
As boyes babble in books, that in scripture are blind:
Yet to their fancy soon a cause will find;
As to live in lust, in lechery to leyke:[526]
Such caitives count to be come of Cains kind;[527]
But that I little John Nobody durst not speake.

For our reverend father hath set forth an order,
Our service to be said in our seignours tongue;
As Solomon the sage set forth the scripture;
Our suffrages, and services, with many a sweet song,
With homilies, and godly books us among,
That no stiff, stubborn stomacks we should freyke:[528]
But wretches nere worse to do poor men wrong;
But that I little John Nobody dare not speake.

For bribery was never so great, since born was our Lord,
And whoredom was never les hated, sith Christ harrowed[529] hel,
And poor men are so sore punished commonly through the world,
That it would grieve any one, that good is, to hear tel.
For al the homilies and good books, yet their hearts be so quel,[530]
That if a man do amisse, with mischiefs they wil him wreake;[531]
The fashion of these new fellows it is so vile and fell:[Pg 138]
But that I little John Nobody dare not speake.

Thus to live after their lust, that life would they have,
And in lechery to leyke al their long life;
For al the preaching of Paul, yet many a proud knave
Wil move mischiefe in their mind both to maid and wife
To bring them in advoutry,[532] or else they wil strife,
And in brawling about baudery, Gods commandments breake:
But of these frantic il fellowes, few of them do thrife;
Though I little John Nobody dare not speake.

If thou company with them, they wil currishly carp,[533] and not care
According to their foolish fantacy; but fast wil they naught:
Prayer with them is but prating; therefore they it forbear:
Both almes deeds, and holiness, they hate it in their thought:
Therefore pray we to that prince, that with his bloud us bought,
That he wil mend that is amiss: for many a manful freyke[534]
Is sorry for these sects, though they say little or nought;
And that I little John Nobody dare not once speake.

Thus in NO place, this Nobody, in NO time I met,
Where NO man, 'ne'[535] NOUGHT was, nor NOTHING did appear;
Through the sound of a synagogue for sorrow I swett,
That 'Aeolus'[536] through the eccho did cause me to hear.
Then I drew me down into a dale, whereas the dumb deer[Pg 139]
Did shiver for a shower; but I shunted[537] from a freyke:
For I would no wight in this world wist who I were,
But little John Nobody, that dare not once speake.

Q. ELIZABETH'S VERSES, WHILE
PRISONER AT WOODSTOCK,


Writ with Charcoal on a Shutter,



  

Are preserved by Hentzner, in that part of his Travels
which has been reprinted in so elegant a manner at
Strawberry-hill. In Hentzner's book they were wretchedly
corrupted, but are here given as amended by his
ingenious editor. The old orthography, and one or two ancient
readings of Hentzner's copy, are here restored.




  



Oh, Fortune! how thy restlesse wavering state
Hath fraught with cares my troubled witt!
Witnes this present prisonn, whither fate
Could beare me, and the joys I quit.[538]
Thou causedest the guiltie to be losed                               5[Pg 140]
From bandes, wherein are innocents inclosed:
Causing the guiltles to be straite reserved,
And freeing those that death had well deserved.
But by her envie can be nothing wroughte,
So God send to my foes all they have thoughte.                      10

V.

THE HEIR OF LINNE.



  

The original of this ballad is found in the Editor's folio
MS., the breaches and defects in which rendered the
insertion of supplemental stanzas necessary. These, it
is hoped, the reader will pardon, as indeed the completion
of the story was suggested by a modern ballad on a similar
subject.

From the Scottish phrases here and there discernible in this
poem, it should seem to have been originally composed beyond
the Tweed.

The Heir of Linne appears not to have been a Lord of Parliament,
but a Laird, whose title went along with his estate.





[In the folio MS. Percy wrote the following note: "This old
copy (tho' a very indifferent fragment) I thought deserving of
some attention. I have therefore bestowed an entire revisal of the
subject for my Reliques, &amp;c." In this revisal, the Bishop swelled
out the 125 lines of the original into the 216 of his own version.
It has, therefore, been necessary to print a copy of the original at
the end of the present ballad. The modern ballad referred to
above is the Drunkard's Legacy, printed in J. H. Dixon's Ballads
of the Peasantry, but it is only comparatively modern, as it dates
back to a period long before Percy's time. The portion which
Percy interpolated and took from this ballad, forms the end of the
first part and beginning of the second part of the following version.

The incident by which the hidden treasure is discovered occurs
in one of the stories of Cinthio's Heccatomithi (Dec. ix. Nov. 8),
but the arguments of the two tales are in other respects different.[Pg 141]
The Scotch claim this ballad as their own. Some suppose the
hero to have been an Ayrshire laird, and others that he was from
Galloway. Motherwell gives the following verses as the commencement
of the traditionary version extant in Scotland:


"The bonnie heir, the weel-faur'd heir,
And the weary heir o' Linne,
Yonder he stands at his father's gate,
And naebody bids him come in,
O see whare he gaup and see whare he stands,
The weary heir o' Linne,
O see whare he stands on the cauld causey,
Some ane wuld ta'en him in.
But if he had been his father's heir,
Or yet the heir o' Linne,
He wadna stand on the cauld causey,
Some ane wuld ta'en him in."]




Part the First.



  



Lithe[539] and listen, gentlemen,
To sing a song I will beginne:
It is of a lord of faire Scotl&agrave;nd,
Which was the unthrifty heire of Linne.

His father was a right good lord,                                    5
His mother a lady of high degree;
But they, alas! were dead, him froe,
And he lov'd keeping companie.

To spend the daye with merry cheare,
To drinke and revell every night,                                 10
To card and dice from eve to morne,
It was, I ween, his hearts delighte

To ride, to runne, to rant, to roare,
To alwaye spend and never spare,
I wott, an' it were the king himselfe,                              15
Of gold and fee he mote be bare.
[Pg 142]
Soe fares the unthrifty lord of Linne
Till all his gold is gone and spent;
And he maun sell his landes so broad,
His house, and landes, and all his rent.                          20

His father had a keen stew&agrave;rde,
And John o' the Scales was called hee:
But John is become a gentel-man,
And John has gott both gold and fee.[540]

Sayes, Welcome, welcome, lord of Linne,                             25
Let nought disturb thy merry cheere;
Iff thou wilt sell thy landes soe broad,
Good store of gold Ile give thee heere.

My gold is gone, my money is spent;
My lande nowe take it unto the:                                   30
Give me the golde, good John o' the Scales,
And thine for aye my lande shall bee.

Then John he did him to record draw,
And John he cast him a gods-pennie;[541]
But for every pounde that John agreed,                              35
The lande, I wis, was well worth three.

He told him the gold upon the borde,
He was right glad his land to winne:
The gold is thine, the land is mine,
And now Ile be the lord of Linne.                                 40

Thus he hath sold his land soe broad,
Both hill and holt,[542] and moore and fenne,
All but a poore and lonesome lodge,
That stood far off in a lonely glenne.
[Pg 143]
For soe he to his father hight.                                     45
My sonne, when I am gonne, sayd hee,
Then thou wilt spend thy lande so broad,
And thou wilt spend thy gold so free:

But sweare me nowe upon the roode,
That lonesome lodge thou'lt never spend;                          50
For when all the world doth frown on thee,
Thou there shalt find a faithful friend.

The heire of Linne is full of golde:
And come with me, my friends, sayd hee,
Let's drinke, and rant, and merry make,                             55
And he that spares, ne'er mote he thee.

They ranted, drank, and merry made,
Till all his gold it waxed thinne;
And then his friendes they slunk away;
They left the unthrifty heire of Linne.                           60

He had never a penny left in his purse,
Never a penny left but three,
And one was brass, another was lead,[543]
And another it was white mon&egrave;y.[543]

Nowe well-aday, sayd the heire of Linne,[543]                     65
Nowe well-aday, and woe is mee,
For when I was the lord of Linne,
I never wanted gold nor fee.

But many a trustye friend have I,
And why shold I feel dole or care?                                70
Ile borrow of them all by turnes,
Soe need I not be never bare.

But one, I wis, was not at home;
Another had payd his gold away;
Another call'd him thriftless loone,                                75
And bade him sharpely wend his way.
[Pg 144]
Now well-aday, sayd the heire of Linne,
Now well-aday, and woe is me!
For when I had my landes so broad,
On me they liv'd right merrilee.                                  80

To beg my bread from door to door
I wis, it were a brenning shame:
To rob and steal it were a sinne:
To worke my limbs I cannot frame.

Now Ile away to lonesome lodge,                                     85
For there my father bade me wend;
When all the world should frown on mee,
I there shold find a trusty friend.




Part the Second.



  



Away then hyed the heire of Linne
O'er hill and holt,[544] and moor and fenne,
Untill he came to lonesome lodge,
That stood so lowe in a lonely glenne.

He looked up, he looked downe,                                       5
In hope some comfort for to winne:
But bare and lothly[545] were the walles.
Here's sorry cheare, quo' the heire of Linne.

The little windowe dim and darke
Was hung with ivy, brere, and yewe;                               10
No shimmering sunn here ever shone;
No halesome breeze here ever blew.

No chair, ne table he mote spye,
No chearful hearth, ne welcome bed,
Nought save a rope with renning noose,                              15
That dangling hung up o'er his head.
[Pg 145]
And over it in broad lett&egrave;rs,
These words were written so plain to see:
"Ah! gracelesse wretch, hast spent thine all,
And brought thyselfe to penur&igrave;e?                                  20

"And this my boding mind misgave,
I therefore left this trusty friend:
Let it now sheeld thy foule disgrace,
And all thy shame and sorrows end."

Sorely shent[546] wi' this rebuke,                                  25
Sorely shent was the heire of Linne;
His heart, I wis, was near to brast
With guilt and sorrowe, shame and sinne.

Never a word spake the heire of Linne,
Never a word he spake but three:                                  30
"This is a trusty friend indeed,
And is right welcome unto mee."

Then round his necke the corde he drewe,
And sprang aloft with his bod&igrave;e:[556]
When lo! the ceiling burst in twaine,                               35
And to the ground came tumbling hee.

Astonyed lay the heire of Linne,
Ne knewe if he were live or dead:
At length he looked, and sawe a bille,[547]
And in it a key of gold so redd.                                  40

He took the bill, and lookt it on,
Strait good comfort found he there:
Itt told him of a hole in the wall,
In which there stood three chests in-fere.[548]
[Pg 146]
Two were full of the beaten golde,                                  45
The third was full of white mon&egrave;y;
And over them in broad lett&egrave;rs
These words were written so plaine to see:

"Once more, my sonne, I sette thee clere;
Amend thy life and follies past;                                  50
For but thou amend thee of thy life,
That rope must be thy end at last."

And let it bee, sayd the heire of Linne;
And let it bee, but if I amend:[549]
For here I will make mine avow,                                     55
This reade[550] shall guide me to the end.

Away then went with a merry cheare,
Away then went the heire of Linne;
I wis, he neither ceas'd ne blanne,[551]
Till John o' the Scales house he did winne.[552]                  60

And when he came to John o' the Scales,
Upp at the speere[553] then looked hee;
There sate three lords upon a rowe,
Were drinking of the wine so free.

And John himself sate at the bord-head,                             65
Because now lord of Linne was hee.
I pray thee, he said, good John o' the Scales,
One forty pence for to lend mee.
[Pg 147]
Away, away, thou thriftless loone;
Away, away, this may not bee:                                     70
For Christs curse on my head, he sayd,
If ever I trust thee one penn&igrave;e.

Then bespake the heire of Linne,
To John o' the Scales wife then spake he:
Madame, some almes on me bestowe,                                   75
I pray for sweet saint Charit&igrave;e.

Away, away, thou thriftless loone,
I swear thou gettest no almes of mee;
For if we shold hang any losel[554] heere,
The first we wold begin with thee.                                80

Then bespake a good fell&ograve;we,
Which sat at John o' the Scales his bord;
Sayd, Turn againe, thou heire of Linne;
Some time thou wast a well good lord:

Some time a good fellow thou hast been,                             85
And sparedst not thy gold and fee;
Therefore Ile lend thee forty pence,
And other forty if need bee.

And ever, I pray thee, John o' the Scales,
To let him sit in thy companie:                                   90
For well I wot thou hadst his land,
And a good bargain it was to thee.

Up then spake him John o' the Scales,
All wood[555] he answer'd him againe:
Now Christs curse on my head, he sayd,                              95
But I did lose by that barg&agrave;ine.
[Pg 148]
And here I proffer thee, heire of Linne,
Before these lords so faire and free,
Thou shalt have it backe again better cheape,
By a hundred markes, than I had it of thee.                      100

I drawe you to record, lords, he said.
With that he cast him a gods pennie:[556]
Now by my fay, sayd the heire of Linne,
And here, good John, is thy mon&egrave;y.

And he pull'd forth three bagges of gold,                          105
And layd them down upon the bord:
All woe begone was John o' the Scales,
Soe shent he cold say never a word.

He told him forth the good red gold,
He told it forth [with] mickle dinne.                            110
The gold is thine, the land is mine,
And now Ime againe the lord of Linne.

Sayes, Have thou here, thou good fell&ograve;we,
Forty pence thou didst lend mee:
Now I am againe the lord of Linne,                                 115
And forty pounds I will give thee.

Ile make the keeper of my forrest,
Both of the wild deere and the tame;
For but[557] I reward thy bounteous heart,
I wis, good fellowe, I were to blame.                            120

Now welladay! sayth Joan o' the Scales:
Now welladay! and woe is my life!
Yesterday I was lady of Linne,
Now Ime but John o' the Scales his wife.
[Pg 149]
Now fare thee well, sayd the heire of Linne;                       125
Farewell now, John o' the Scales, said hee:
Christs curse light on me, if ever again
I bring my lands in jeopardy.

are restored from the folio MS.







  

The following original version of the Heir of Linne is
reprinted from Hales and Furnivall's edition of the folio
MS. vol. i. p. 174:


Off all the lords in faire Scottland
a song I will begin:
amongst them all there dweld a Lord
which was the vnthrifty Lord of linne.                             4

his father &amp; mother were dead him froe,
&amp; soe was the head of all his kinne;
he did neither cease nor bl&iota;nne
to the cards &amp; dice that he did run,                               8

to drinke the wine that was soe cleere,
with euery man he wold make merry.
and then bespake him John of the Scales,
vnto the heire of Linne sayd hee,                                 12

sayes, "how dost thou, Lord of Linne,
doest either want gold or fee?
wilt thou not sell thy lands soe brode
to such a good fellow as me?                                      16

"ffor ... I ..." he said,
"my land, take it vnto thee,
I draw you to record, my Lord[e]s all:"
with that he cast him a good-se peny,                             20

he told him the gold vpon the bord,
it wanted neuer a bare penny.
"that gold is thine, the land is mine,
the heire of Linne I wilbee."                                     24

"heeres gold inoughe," saithe the heire of Linne,
"both for me &amp; my company."
he drunke the wine that was soe cleere,
&amp; with euery man he made merry.                                   28[Pg 150]

with-in 3 quarters of a yeere
his gold &amp; fee it waxed thinne,
his merry men were from him gone,
&amp; left him himselfe all alone.                                    32

he had neuer a penny left in his pursse,
neuer a penny but 3,
&amp; one was brasse, &amp; another was lead,
&amp; another was white mony.                                         36

"Now well-a day!" said the heire of Linne,
"now welladay, &amp; woe is mee!
for when I was the lord of Linne,
I neither wanted gold nor fee;                                    40

"for I haue sold my lands soe broad,
&amp; haue not left me one penny!
I must goe now &amp; take some read
vnto Edenborrow, &amp; begg my bread."                                44

he had not beene in Edenborrow
not 3 qwarters of a yeere,
but some did giue him &amp; some said nay,
&amp; some bid "to the deele gang yee!                                48

"for if we shold hang any Land selfeer,
the first we wold begin with thee."
"Now welladay!" said the heire of Linne,
no[w] welladay, &amp; woe is mee!                                     52

"for now I have sold my lands soe broad,
that mery man is irke with mee;
but when that I was the Lord of Linne,
then on my land I liued merrily;                                  56

"&amp; now I have sold my land soe broade
that I haue not left me one pennye!
god be with my father!" he said,
"on his land he liued merrily."                                   60

Still in a study there as he stood,
he vnbethought him of [a] bill
[he vnbethought him of a bill]
which his father had left with him,                               64

bade him he shold neuer on it looke
till he was in extreame neede,
"&amp; by my faith," said the heire of Linne,
"then now I had neuer more neede."                                68[Pg 151]

he tooke the bill, &amp; looked it on,
good comfort that he found there;
itt told him of a Castle wall
where there stood 3 chests in feare:                              72

2 were full of the beaten gold,
the 3 was full of white mony.
he turned then downe his baggs of bread,
&amp; filled them full of gold soe red;                               76

then he did neuer cease nor blinne
till John of the Scales house he did winne.
when that he came to John of the Scales,
vpp at the speere he looked then:                                 80
there sate 3 lords vpon a rowe,
and John o the Scales sate at the bords head,
[and John o the Scales sate at the bords head]
because he was the Lord of Linne.                                 84

and then bespake the heire of Linne,
to John o the Scales wiffe thus sayd hee:
sayd, "Dame, wilt thou not trust me one shott
that I may sitt downe in this company?"                           88

"now, christs curse on my head," shee said,
"if I do trust thee one pennye."
then bespake a good fellowe,
which sate by John o the Scales his knee,                         92

Said, "haue thou here, thou heire of linne,
40 pence I will lend thee,&mdash;
some time a good fellow thou hast beene,&mdash;
&amp; other 40 if neede bee,"                                         96

th&eacute; druken wine that was soe cleere,
&amp; euery man th&eacute; made merry;
&amp; then bespake him John o the Scales,
vnto the Lord of linne said hee:                                 100

said, "how doest thou, heire of Linne,
since I did buy thy Lands of thee?
I will sell it to thee 20li better cheepe
nor euer I did buy it of thee.                                   104

"I draw you to recorde, lord[e]s all;"
with that he cast him gods penny;
then he tooke to his baggs of bread,
&amp; they were full of the gold soe redd,                           108[Pg 152]

he told him the gold then over the borde;
it wanted neuer a broad pennye:
"that gold is thine, the land is mine,
&amp; the heire of Linne againe I wilbee."                           112

"Now welladay!" said John o the Scales wife,
"welladay, &amp; woe is me!
Yesterday I was the lady of Linne,
&amp; now I am but John o the Scales wiffe!"                         116

saies, "haue thou heere, thou good fellow,
40 pence thou did lend me,
[40 pence thou did lend me,]
&amp; 40^{l}. I will giue thee,                                      120
Ile make thee keeper of my forrest,
both of the wild deere &amp; the tame."

but then bespake the heire of Linne,
these were the words, &amp; thus said hee,                           124
"Christs curse light vpon my crowne
if ere my land stand in any Jeopardye!"

VI.

GASCOIGNE'S PRAISE OF THE FAIR
BRIDGES, AFTERWARDS
LADY SANDS,


On Her having a Scar in Her Forehead.



  

George Gascoigne was a celebrated poet in the early
part of Queen Elizabeth's reign, and appears to great
advantage among the miscellaneous writers of that age.
He was author of three or four plays, and of many
smaller poems; one of the most remarkable of which is a satire in
blank verse, called the Steele-glass, 1576, 4to.

Gascoigne was born in Essex, educated in both universities,
whence he removed to Gray's-inn; but, disliking the study of the
law, became first a dangler at court, and afterwards a soldier in
the wars of the Low Countries. He had no great success in any[Pg 153]
of these pursuits, as appears from a poem of his, intitled "Gascoigne's
Wodmanship, written to lord Gray of Wilton." Many of
his epistles dedicatory are dated in 1575, 1576, from "his poore
house in Walthamstoe:" where he died a middle-aged man in
1578, according to Anth. Wood: or rather in 1577, if he is the
person meant in an old tract, intitled, "A remembrance of the
well employed Life and godly End of Geo. Gascoigne, Esq.;
who deceased at Stamford in Lincolnshire, Oct. 7, 1577, by Geo.
Whetstone, Gent. an eye-witness of his godly and charitable end
in this world," 4to. no date. [From a MS. of Oldys.]

Mr. Thomas Warton thinks "Gascoigne has much exceeded all
the poets of his age, in smoothness and harmony of versification."[558]
But the truth is, scarce any of the earlier poets of Q.
Elizabeth's time are found deficient in harmony and smoothness,
tho' those qualities appear so rare in the writings of their successors.
In the Paradise of Dainty Devises,[559] (the Dodsley's Miscellany
of those times) will hardly be found one rough, or
inharmonious line:[560] whereas the numbers of Jonson, Donne, and
most of their contemporaries, frequently offend the ear like the
filing of a saw. Perhaps this is in some measure to be accounted
for from the growing pedantry of that age, and from the writers
affecting to run their lines into one another, after the manner of
the Latin and Greek poets.

The following poem (which the elegant writer above quoted
hath recommended to notice, as possessed of a delicacy rarely to
be seen in that early state of our poetry) properly consists of
Alexandrines of twelve and fourteen syllables, and is printed from
two quarto black-letter collections of Gascoigne's pieces; the first
intitled, "A hundreth sundrie flowres, bounde up in one small
posie, &amp;c. London, imprinted for Richarde Smith:" without date,
but from a letter of H. W. (p. 202), compared with the printer's
epist. to the reader, it appears to have been published in 1572, or
3. The other is intitled, "The Posies of George Gascoigne,
Esq.; corrected, perfected, and augmented by the author; 1575.&mdash;Printed
at Lond. for Richard Smith, &amp;c." No year, but the
epist. dedicat. is dated 1576.

In the title-page of this last (by way of printer's,[561] or bookseller's
device) is an ornamental wooden cut, tolerably well
[Pg 154]executed, wherein Time is represented drawing the figure of
Truth out of a pit or cavern, with this legend, Occulta veritas
tempore patet [R. S.] This is mentioned because it is not improbable
but the accidental sight of this or some other title-page
containing the same device, suggested to Rubens that well-known
design of a similar kind, which he has introduced into the Luxemburg
gallery,[562] and which has been so justly censured for the
unnatural manner of its execution.

The lady here celebrated was Catharine, daughter of Edmond
second Lord Chandos, wife of William Lord Sands. See Collins's
Peerage, vol. ii. p. 133, ed. 1779.





[George Gascoigne, soldier and poet, had many enemies, and
when objection was made to the Privy Council against his return as
a burgess for Midhurst, they termed him "a common rymer, ruffian,
atheist," &amp;c. Mr. W. C. Hazlitt printed a complete collection of
his poems in the Roxburghe Library, 2 vols. London, 1869-70.]

FAIR ROSAMOND.



  

Most of the circumstances in this popular story of king
Henry II. and the beautiful Rosamond have been
taken for fact by our English historians; who, unable to
account for the unnatural conduct of queen Eleanor in
stimulating her sons to rebellion, have attributed it to jealousy,
[Pg 157]and supposed that Henry's amour with Rosamond was the object
of that passion.

Our old English annalists seem, most of them, to have followed
Higden the monk of Chester, whose account, with some enlargements,
is thus given by Stow:&mdash;"Rosamond the fayre daughter of
Walter lord Clifford, concubine to Henry II. (poisoned by queen
Elianor, as some thought) dyed at Woodstocke [A.D. 1177] where
king Henry had made for her a house of wonderfull working; so
that no man or woman might come to her, but he that was instructed
by the king, or such as were right secret with him
touching the matter. This house after some was named Labyrinthus,
or Dedalus worke, which was wrought like unto a knot in
a garden, called a maze;[564] but it was commonly said, that lastly
the queene came to her by a clue of thridde, or silke, and so dealt
with her, that she lived not long after: but when she was dead,
she was buried at Godstow in an house of nunnes, beside Oxford,
with these verses upon her tombe:&mdash;


'Hic jacet in tumba, Rosa mundi, non Rosa munda:
Non redolet, sed olet, qu&aelig; redolere solet.'


"In English thus:&mdash;


'The rose of the world, but not the cleane flowre,
Is now here graven; to whom beauty was lent:
In this grave full darke nowe is her bowre,
That by her life was sweete and redolent:
But now that she is from this life blent,
Though she were sweete, now foully doth she stinke.
A mirrour good for all men, that on her thinke.'"



Stowe's Annals, ed. 1631, p. 154.


How the queen gained admittance into Rosamond's bower is
differently related. Hollinshed speaks of it, as "the common
report of the people, that the queene ... founde hir out by a
silken thread, which the king had drawne after him out of hir
chamber with his foot, and dealt with hir in such sharpe and
cruell wise, that she lived not long after." Vol. iii. p. 115. On
the other hand, in Speede's Hist. we are told that the jealous
queen found her out "by a clew of silke, fallen from Rosamund's
lappe, as shee sate to take ayre, and suddenly fleeing from the
sight of the searcher, the end of her silke fastened to her foot, and
[Pg 158]the clew still unwinding, remained behinde: which the queene
followed, till she had found what she sought, and upon Rosamund
so vented her spleene, as the lady lived not long after." 3rd edit.
p. 509. Our ballad-maker with more ingenuity, and probably as
much truth, tells us the clue was gained by surprise, from the
knight who was left to guard her bower.

It is observable, that none of the old writers attribute Rosamond's
death to poison (Stow, above, mentions it merely as a
slight conjecture); they only give us to understand, that the queen
treated her harshly; with furious menaces, we may suppose, and
sharp expostulations, which had such effect on her spirits, that she
did not long survive it. Indeed on her tomb-stone, as we learn
from a person of credit,[565] among other fine sculptures, was engraven
the figure of a cup. This, which perhaps at first was an
accidental ornament (perhaps only the chalice) might in after
times suggest the notion that she was poisoned; at least this construction
was put upon it, when the stone came to be demolished
after the nunnery was dissolved. The account is, that "the tomb-stone
of Rosamund Clifford was taken up at Godstow, and broken
in pieces, and that upon it were interchangeable weavings drawn
out and decked with roses red and green, and the picture of the
cup, out of which she drank the poison given her by the queen,
carved in stone."

Rosamond's father having been a great benefactor to the nunnery
of Godstow, where she had also resided herself in the innocent
part of her life, her body was conveyed there, and buried in the
middle of the choir; in which place it remained till the year
1191, when Hugh bishop of Lincoln caused it to be removed.
The fact is recorded by Hoveden, a contemporary writer, whose
words are thus translated by Stow: "Hugh bishop of Lincolne
came to the abbey of nunnes, called Godstow, ... and when
he had entred the church to pray, he saw a tombe in the middle
of the quire, covered with a pall of silke, and set about with lights
of waxe: and demanding whose tomb it was, he was answered,
that it was the tombe of Rosamond, that was some time lemman
to Henry II.... who for the love of her had done much good
to that church. Then quoth the bishop, take out of this place the
harlot, and bury her without the church, lest christian religion
should grow in contempt, and to the end that, through example of
her, other women being made afraid may beware, and keepe
themselves from unlawfull and advouterous company with men."&mdash;Annals,
p. 159.
[Pg 159]
History further informs us, that king John repaired Godstow
nunnery, and endowed it with yearly revenues, "that these holy
virgins might releeve with their prayers, the soules of his father
king Henrie, and of lady Rosamund there interred."[566] ... In
what situation her remains were found at the dissolution of the
nunnery, we learn from Leland: "Rosamundes tumbe at Godstowe
nunnery was taken up [of] late; it is a stone with this inscription,
Tumba Rosamund&aelig;. Her bones were closid in lede,
and withyn that bones were closyd yn lether. When it was
opened a very swete smell came owt of it."[567] See Hearne's discourse
above quoted, written in 1718; at which time he tells us,
were still seen by the pool at Woodstock the foundations of a very
large building, which were believed to be the remains of Rosamond's
labyrinth.

To conclude this (perhaps too prolix) account, Henry had two
sons by Rosamond, from a computation of whose age, a modern
historian has endeavoured to invalidate the received story. These
were William Longue-esp&eacute; (or Long-sword), earl of Salisbury, and
Geoffrey, bishop of Lincolne.[568] Geoffrey was the younger of
Rosamond's sons, and yet is said to have been twenty years old at
the time of his election to that see in 1173. Hence this writer
concludes, that king Henry fell in love with Rosamond in 1149,
when in king Stephen's reign he came over to be knighted by the
king of Scots; he also thinks it probable that Henry's commerce
with this lady "broke off upon his marriage with Eleanor (in
1152) and that the young lady, by a natural effect of grief and
resentment at the defection of her lover, entered on that occasion
into the nunnery of Godstowe, where she died probably before the
rebellion of Henry's sons in 1173." (Carte's Hist. vol. i. p. 652.)
But let it be observed, that Henry was but sixteen years old when
he came over to be knighted; that he staid but eight months in
this island, and was almost all the time with the king of Scots;
that he did not return back to England till 1153, the year after his
marriage with Eleanor; and that no writer drops the least hint of
Rosamond's having ever been abroad with her lover, nor indeed is
it probable that a boy of sixteen should venture to carry over a
mistress to his mother's court. If all these circumstances are
considered, Mr. Carte's account will be found more incoherent
[Pg 160]and improbable than that of the old ballad; which is also countenanced
by most of our old historians.

Indeed the true date of Geoffrey's birth, and consequently of
Henry's commerce with Rosamond, seems to be best ascertained
from an ancient manuscript in the Cotton library: wherein it is
thus registered of Geoffrey Plantagenet: "Natus est 5&deg; Hen. II.
[1159.] Factus est miles 25&deg; Hen. II. [1179.] Elect. in
Episcop. Lincoln. 28&deg; Hen. II. [1182.]" Vid. Chron. de Kirkstall
(Domitian XII.) Drake's Hist. of York, p. 422.

The ballad of Fair Rosamond appears to have been first published
in "Strange Histories, or Songs and Sonnets, of Kinges,
Princes, Dukes, Lords, Ladyes, Knights, and Gentlemen, &amp;c. By
Thomas Delone. Lond. 1607." 12mo.

It is here printed (with conjectural emendations), from four
ancient copies in black-letter; two of them in the Pepys library.





[It is also printed in the Crown Garland of Golden Roses, and
Garland of Goodwill. Reprinted by the Percy Society.

In the Collection of Old Ballads, 1723, vol. i. p. 1, is another
ballad on the same subject, with the title, The Unfortunate Concubine,
or Rosamond's Overthrow.

The story is also treated in Warner's Albion's England
(ch. 41).]




  



When as king Henry rulde this land,
The second of that name,
Besides the queene, he dearly lovde
A faire and comely dame.

Most peerlesse was her beautye founde,                               5
Her favour, and her face;
A sweeter creature in this worlde
Could never prince embrace.

Her crisped lockes like threads of golde
Appeard to each mans sight;                                       10
Her sparkling eyes, like Orient pearles,
Did cast a heavenlye light.[Pg 161]

The blood within her crystal cheekes
Did such a colour drive,
As though the lillye and the rose                                   15
For mastership did strive.

Yea Rosamonde, fair Rosamonde,
Her name was called so,
To whom our queene, dame Ellinor,
Was known a deadlye foe.                                          20

The king therefore, for her defence,
Against the furious queene,
At Woodstocke builded such a bower,
The like was never seene.

Most curiously that bower was built                                 25
Of stone and timber strong,
An hundered and fifty doors
Did to this bower belong:

And they so cunninglye contriv'd
With turnings round about,                                        30
That none but with a clue of thread,
Could enter in or out.

And for his love and ladyes sake,
That was so faire and brighte,
The keeping of this bower he gave                                   35
Unto a valiant knighte.

But fortune, that doth often frowne
Where she before did smile,
The kinges delighte and ladyes joy
Full soon shee did beguile:                                       40

For why, the kinges ungracious sonne,
Whom he did high advance,
Against his father raised warres
Within the realme of France.[Pg 162]

But yet before our comelye king                                     45
The English land forsooke,
Of Rosamond, his lady faire,
His farewelle thus he tooke:

"My Rosamonde, my only Rose,
That pleasest best mine eye:                                      50
The fairest flower in all the worlde
To feed my fantasye:

The flower of mine affected heart,
Whose sweetness doth excelle:
My royal Rose, a thousand times                                     55
I bid thee nowe farwelle!

For I must leave my fairest flower,
My sweetest Rose, a space,
And cross the seas to famous France,
Proud rebelles to abase.                                          60

But yet, my Rose, be sure thou shalt
My coming shortlye see,
And in my heart, when hence I am,
Ile beare my Rose with mee."

When Rosamond, that ladye brighte,                                  65
Did heare the king saye soe,
The sorrowe of her grieved heart
Her outward lookes did showe;

And from her cleare and crystall eyes
The teares gusht out apace,                                       70
Which like the silver-pearled dewe
Ranne downe her comely face.

Her lippes, erst like the corall redde,
Did waxe both wan and pale,
And for the sorrow she conceivde                                    75
Her vitall spirits faile;[Pg 163]

And falling down all in a swoone
Before king Henryes face,
Full oft he in his princelye armes
Her bodye did embrace:                                            80

And twentye times, with watery eyes,
He kist her tender cheeke,
Untill he had revivde againe
Her senses milde and meeke.

Why grieves my Rose, my sweetest Rose?                              85
The king did often say.
Because, quoth shee, to bloodye warres
My lord must part awaye.

But since your grace on forrayne coastes
Amonge your foes unkinde                                          90
Must goe to hazard life and limbe,
Why should I staye behinde?

Nay rather, let me, like a page,
Your sworde and target beare;
That on my breast the blowes may lighte,                            95
Which would offend you there.

Or lett mee, in your royal tent,
Prepare your bed at nighte,
And with sweete baths refresh your grace,
At your returne from fighte.                                     100

So I your presence may enjoye
No toil I will refuse;
But wanting you, my life is death;
Nay, death Ild rather chuse!

"Content thy self, my dearest love;                                105
Thy rest at home shall bee
In Englandes sweet and pleasant isle;
For travell fits not thee.[Pg 164]

Faire ladies brooke not bloodye warres;
Soft peace their sexe delightes;                                 110
'Not rugged campes, but courtlye bowers;
Gay feastes, not cruell fightes.'

My Rose shall safely here abide,
With musicke passe the daye;
Whilst I, amonge the piercing pikes,                               115
My foes seeke far awaye.

My Rose shall shine in pearle, and golde,
Whilst Ime in armour dighte;
Gay galliards here my love shall dance,
Whilst I my foes goe fighte.                                     120

And you, sir Thomas, whom I truste
To bee my loves defence;
Be carefull of my gallant Rose
When I am parted hence."

And therewithall he fetcht a sigh,                                 125
As though his heart would breake:
And Rosamonde, for very griefe,
Not one plaine word could speake.

And at their parting well they mighte
In heart be grieved sore:                                        130
After that daye faire Rosamonde
The king did see no more.

For when his grace had past the seas,
And into France was gone,
With envious heart, queene Ellinor,                                135
To Woodstocke came anone.

And forth she calles this trustye knighte,
In an unhappy houre;
Who with his clue of twined thread,
Came from this famous bower.                                     140[Pg 165]

And when that they had wounded him,
The queene this thread did gette,
And went where ladye Rosamonde
Was like an angell sette.

But when the queene with stedfast eye                              145
Beheld her beauteous face,
She was amazed in her minde
At her exceeding grace.

Cast off from thee those robes, she said,
That riche and costlye bee;                                      150
And drinke thou up this deadlye draught,
Which I have brought to thee.

Then presentlye upon her knees
Sweet Rosamonde did falle;
And pardon of the queene she crav'd                                155
For her offences all.

"Take pitty on my youthfull yeares,
Faire Rosamonde did crye;
And lett mee not with poison stronge
Enforced bee to dye.                                             160

I will renounce my sinfull life,
And in some cloyster bide;
Or else be banisht, if you please,
To range the world soe wide.

And for the fault which I have done,                               165
Though I was forc'd theretoe,
Preserve my life, and punish mee
As you thinke meet to doe."

And with these words, her lillie handes
She wrunge full often there;                                     170
And downe along her lovely face
Did trickle many a teare.[Pg 166]

But nothing could this furious queene
Therewith appeased bee;
The cup of deadlye poyson stronge,                                 175
As she knelt on her knee,

Shee gave this comelye dame to drinke;
Who tooke it in her hand,
And from her bended knee arose,
And on her feet did stand:                                       180

And casting up her eyes to heaven,
Shee did for mercye calle;
And drinking up the poyson stronge,
Her life she lost withalle.

And when that death through everye limbe                           185
Had showde its greatest spite,
Her chiefest foes did plaine confesse
Shee was a glorious wighte.

Her body then they did entomb,
When life was fled away,                                         190
At Godstowe, neare to Oxford towne,
As may be seene this day.

divorce from her, and restored her those rich provinces, which by
her marriage she had annexed to the crown of France. The
young count of Anjou, afterwards Henry II. king of England,
tho' at that time but in his nineteenth year, neither discouraged
by the disparity of age, nor by the reports of Eleanor's gallantry,
made such successful courtship to that princess, that he married
her six weeks after her divorce, and got possession of all her
dominions as a dowery. A marriage thus founded upon interest
was not likely to be very happy: it happened accordingly,
Eleanor, who had disgusted her first husband by her gallantries,
was no less offensive to her second by her jealousy: thus carrying
to extremity, in the different parts of her life, every circumstance
of female weakness. She had several sons by Henry, whom she
spirited up to rebel against him; and endeavouring to escape to
them disguised in man's apparel in 1173, she was discovered and
thrown into a confinement, which seems to have continued till the
death of her husband in 1189. She however survived him many
years: dying in 1204, in the sixth year of the reign of her youngest
son, John." See Hume's Hist. 4to. vol. i. pp. 260, 307. Speed,
Stow, &amp;c.

It is needless to observe, that the following ballad (given, with
some corrections, from an old printed copy) is altogether fabulous;
whatever gallantries Eleanor encouraged in the time of her first
husband, none are imputed to her in that of her second.





[The idea of the unlucky shrift exhibited in the following ballad
is taken from some old story-teller. It occurs among the tales of
Boccaccio, Bandello, Barbazan, La Fontaine, and several other
writers.

A copy of this ballad, differing very considerably from the present
version, is to be found in Kinloch's Ancient Scottish Ballads.
The first stanza is as follows:&mdash;


"The queen fell sick, and very, very sick
She was sick and like to dee
And she sent for a frier oure frae France
Her confessour to be."




The last stanza but four reads:&mdash;


"And do you see yon pretty little girl
That's a beclad in green?
She's a friar's daughter oure in France
And I hoped to see her a queen."




And the end as follows:&mdash;

[Pg 168]


"The king look'd over his left shoulder,
An angry man was he:&mdash;
An it werna for the oath I sware
Earl Marshall, thou shouldst dee."




Another version, recovered from recitation, and more like
Percy's than Kinloch's, is printed by Motherwell in his Minstrelsy,
under the title of "Earl Marshall."]




  



Queene Elianor was a sicke wom&agrave;n.
And afraid that she should dye:
Then she sent for two fryars of France
To speke with her speedilye.

The king calld downe his nobles all,                                 5
By one, by two, by three;
"Earl marshall, Ile goe shrive the queene,
And thou shalt wend with mee."

A boone, a boone; quoth earl marsh&agrave;ll,
And fell on his bended knee;                                      10
That whatsoever queene Elianor saye,
No harme therof may bee.

Ile pawne my landes, the king then cryd,
My sceptre, crowne, and all,
That whatsoere queen Elianor sayes                                  15
No harme thereof shall fall.

Do thou put on a fryars coat,
And Ile put on another;
And we will to queen Elianor goe
Like fryar and his brother.                                       20

Thus both attired then they goe:
When they came to Whitehall,
The bells did ring, and the quiristers sing,
And the torches did lighte them all.[Pg 169]

When that they came before the queene                               25
They fell on their bended knee;
A boone, a boone, our gracious queene,
That you sent so hastilee.

Are you two fryars of France, she sayd,
As I suppose you bee,                                             30
But if you are two Englishe fryars,
You shall hang on the gallowes tree.

We are two fryars of France, they sayd,
As you suppose we bee,
We have not been at any masse                                       35
Sith we came from the sea.

The first vile thing that ever I did
I will to you unfolde;
Earl marshall had my maidenhed,
Beneath this cloth of golde.                                      40

Thats a vile sinne, then sayd the king;
May God forgive it thee!
Amen, amen, quoth earl marshall;
With a heavye heart spake hee.

The next vile thing that ever I did,                                45
To you Ile not denye,
I made a boxe of poyson strong,
To poison king Henrye.

Thats a vile sinne, then sayd the king,
May God forgive it thee!                                          50
Amen, amen, quoth earl marshall;
And I wish it so may bee.

The next vile thing that ever I did,
To you I will discover;
I poysoned fair Rosamonde,                                          55
All in fair Woodstocke bower.[Pg 170]

Thats a vile sinne, then sayd the king;
May God forgive it thee!
Amen, amen, quoth earl marshal;
And I wish it so may bee.                                         60

Do you see yonders little boye,
A tossing of the balle?
That is earl marshalls eldest sonne,[569]
And I love him the best of all.

Do you see yonders little boye,                                     65
A catching of the balle?
That is king Henryes youngest sonne,[569]
And I love him the worst of all.

His head is fashyon'd like a bull;                                  70
His nose is like a boare.
No matter for that, king Henrye cryd,
I love him the better therfore.

The king pulled off his fryars coate,
And appeared all in redde:                                        75
She shrieked, and cryd, and wrung her hands,
And sayd she was betrayde.

The king lookt over his left shoulder,
And a grimme look looked hee,
Earl marshall, he sayd, but for my oathe,                           80
Or hanged thou shouldst bee.

IX.

THE STURDY ROCK.



  

This poem, subscribed M. T. (perhaps invertedly for
T. Marshall[570]) is preserved in The Paradise of Daintie
Devises. The two first stanzas may be found accompanied
with musical notes in "An howres recreation
in musicke, &amp;c. by Richard Alison, Lond. 1606, 4to."
usually bound up with three or four sets of "Madrigals set to
music by Tho. Weelkes, Lond. 1597, 1600, 1608, 4to." One of
these madrigals is so compleat an example of the bathos, that I
cannot forbear presenting it to the reader:&mdash;


"Thule, the period of cosmographie,
Doth vaunt of Hecla, whose sulphureous fire
Doth melt the frozen clime, and thaw the skie,
Trinacrian &AElig;tna's flames ascend not hier:
These things seeme wondrous, yet more wondrous I,
Whose heart with feare doth freeze, with love doth fry.

"The Andelusian merchant, that returnes
Laden with cutchinele and china dishes,
Reports in Spaine, how strangely Fogo burnes
Amidst an ocean full of flying fishes:
These things seeme wondrous, yet more wondrous I,
Whose heart with feare doth freeze, with love doth fry."


Mr. Weelkes seems to have been of opinion, with many of his
brethren of later times, that nonsense was best adapted to display
the powers of musical composure.





[Percy's conjecture that the author is Marshall is not a happy
one. Sir Egerton Brydges, in his edition of the Paradise, 1810
(British Bibliographer, vol. iii.), attributes it to M. Thorn, whose
name is signed to another poem, numbered 52:&mdash;


"Now mortall man beholde and see,
This worlde is but a vanitie,"




written in much the same spirit. The heading to the Sturdy
Rock is:&mdash;


"Man's flitting life fyndes surest stay,
Where sacred vertue beareth sway."]

[Pg 172]



  



The sturdy rock for all his strength
By raging seas is rent in twaine:
The marble stone is pearst at length,
With little drops of drizling rain:
The oxe doth yeeld unto the yoke,                                    5
The steele obeyeth the hammer stroke.

The stately stagge, that seemes so stout,
By yalping hounds at bay is set:
The swiftest bird, that flies about,
Is caught at length in fowlers net:                               10
The greatest fish, in deepest brooke,
Is soon deceived by subtill hooke.

Yea man himselfe, unto whose will
All things are bounden to obey,
For all his wit and worthie skill,                                  15
Doth fade at length, and fall away.
There is nothing but time doeth waste;
The heavens, the earth consume at last.

But vertue sits triumphing still
Upon the throne of glorious fame:                                 20
Though spiteful death mans body kill,
Yet hurts he not his vertuous name:
By life or death what so betides,
The state of vertue never slides.

X.

THE BEGGAR'S DAUGHTER OF
BEDNALL-GREEN.



  

This popular old ballad was written in the reign of
Elizabeth, as appears not only from ver. 23, where the
arms of England are called the "Queenes armes;" but
from its tune's being quoted in other old pieces,
written in her time. See the ballad on Mary Ambree in this
volume. The late Mr. Guthrie assured the editor that he had
formerly seen another old song on the same subject, composed in
a different measure from this; which was truly beautiful, if we
may judge from the only stanza he remembered. In this it was
said of the old beggar, that "down his neck


"&mdash;&mdash;his reverend lockes
In comelye curles did wave;
And on his aged temples grewe
The blossomes of the grave."


The following ballad is chiefly given from the Editor's folio MS.
compared with two ancient printed copies: the concluding stanzas,
which contain the old beggar's discovery of himself, are not however
given from any of these, being very different from those of
the vulgar ballad. Nor yet does the Editor offer them as genuine,
but as a modern attempt to remove the absurdities and inconsistencies,
which so remarkably prevailed in this part of the song,
as it stood before: whereas by the alteration of a few lines, the
story is rendered much more affecting, and is reconciled to probability
and true history. For this informs us, that at the decisive
battle of Evesham (fought Aug. 4, 1265), when Simon de Montfort,
the great Earl of Leicester, was slain at the head of the
barons, his eldest son Henry fell by his side, and in consequence
of that defeat, his whole family sunk for ever, the king bestowing
their great honours and possessions on his second son, Edmund
earl of Lancaster.





[This charming old ballad has enjoyed a long life of popularity,
and according to Mr. Chappell it is still kept in print in Seven
Dials, and sung about the country. As it is to be found in most
collections, it has not been thought necessary to take note of the[Pg 174]
various trifling alterations which Percy made, but the six stanzas
which he ejected in favour of the eight between brackets are
printed at the end. A few of the alterations are improvements,
but most of them are the reverse; thus, in place of the received
reading of verse 28,


"Was straightway in love with pretty Bessee,"




Percy prints


"Was straightway enamourd of pretty Bessee."




Mr. John Pickford (Notes and Queries, 4th Series, vol. ix.
p. 64) once possessed an old mezzotint engraving of the Blind
Beggar of a large folio size, on the margin of which were inscribed
the lines referred to above. In Robert Greene's Pandosto (1588),
from which Shakspere drew the plot of his Winter's Tale, there is
the same simile as is used in these verses. Egistus says:&mdash;"Thou
seest my white hayres are blossomes for the grave."

Pepys in his Diary (25th June, 1663), speaks of going to
dinner with Sir William and Lady Batten and Sir J. Minnes to Sir
William Ryder's at Bethnall Green, and adds: "This very house
was built by the blind beggar of Bednall Green, so much talked of
and sang in ballads, but they say it was only some outhouse of it."
The mansion was built by John Kirby, a citizen of London, in the
reign of Queen Elizabeth, and afterwards became the residence of
Sir Hugh Platt, author of The Jewell House of Art and Nature,
1594; The Garden of Eden, &amp;c. Ryder died there in 1669.]



Part the First.



  



Itt was a blind beggar, had long lost his sight,
He had a faire daughter of bewty most bright;
And many a gallant brave suiter had shee,
For none was soe comelye as pretty Bessee.

And though shee was of favor most faire,                             5
Yett seeing shee was but a poor beggars heyre,
Of ancyent housekeepers despised was shee,
Whose sonnes came as suitors to prettye Bessee.[Pg 175]

Wherefore in great sorrow faire Bessy did say,
Good father, and mother, let me goe away                            10
To seeke out my fortune, whatever itt bee.
This suite then they granted to prettye Bessee.

Then Bessy, that was of bewtye soe bright,
All cladd in gray russett, and late in the night
From father and mother alone parted shee;                           15
Who sighed and sobbed for prettye Bessee.

Shee went till shee came to Stratford-le-Bow;
Then knew shee not whither, nor which way to goe:
With teares shee lamented her hard destin&igrave;e,
So sadd and soe heavy was pretty Bessee.                            20

Shee kept on her journey untill it was day,
And went unto Rumford along the hye way;
Where at the Queenes armes entertained was shee:
Soe faire and wel favoured was pretty Bessee.

Shee had not beene there a month to an end,                         25
But master and mistres and all was her friend:
And every brave gallant, that once did her see,
Was straight-way enamourd of pretty Bessee.

Great gifts they did send her of silver and gold,
And in their songs daylye her love was extold;                      30
Her beawtye was blazed in every degree;
Soe faire and soe comelye was pretty Bessee.

The young men of Rumford in her had their joy;
Shee shewed herself curteous, and modestlye coye;
And at her commandment still wold they bee;                         35
Soe fayre and soe comlye was pretty Bessee.

Foure suitors att once unto her did goe;
They craved her favor, but still she sayd noe;
I wold not wish gentles to marry with mee.
Yett ever they honored prettye Bessee.                              40[Pg 176]

The first of them was a gallant young knight,
And he came unto her disguisde in the night:
The second a gentleman of good degree,
Who wooed and sued for prettye Bessee.

A merchant of London, whose wealth was not small,                   45
He was the third suiter, and proper withall:
Her masters own sonne the fourth man must bee,
Who swore he would dye for pretty Bessee.

And, if thou wilt marry with mee, quoth the knight,
Ile make thee a ladye with joy and delight;                         50
My hart's so inthralled by thy bewt&igrave;e,
That soone I shall dye for prettye Bessee.

The gentleman sayd, Come, marry with mee,
As fine as a ladye my Bessy shal bee:
My life is distressed: O heare me, quoth hee;                       55
And grant me thy love, my prettye Bessee.

Let me bee thy husband, the merchant cold say,
Thou shalt live in London both gallant and gay;
My shippes shall bring home rych jewells for thee,
And I will for ever love pretty Bessee.                             60

Then Bessy shee sighed, and thus shee did say,
My father and mother I meane to obey;
First gett their good will, and be faithfull to mee,
And you shall enjoye your prettye Bessee.

To every one this answer shee made,                                 65
Wherfore unto her they joyfullye sayd,
This thing to fulfill wee all doe agree;
But where dwells thy father, my prettye Bessee?

My father, shee said, is soone to be seene:
The seely blind beggar of Bednall-greene,                           70
That daylye sits begging for charit&igrave;e,
He is the good father of pretty Bessee.[Pg 177]

His markes and his tokens are knowen very well;
He alwayes is led with a dogg and a bell:
A seely olde man, God knoweth, is hee,                              75
Yett hee is the father of pretty Bessee.

Nay then, quoth the merchant, thou art not for mee:
Nor, quoth the innholder, my wiffe thou shalt bee:
I lothe, sayd the gentle, a beggars degree,
And therefore, adewe, my pretty Bessee!                             80

Why then, quoth the knight, hap better or worse,
I waighe not true love by the waight of the pursse,
And bewtye is bewtye in every degree;
Then welcome unto me, my pretty Bessee.

With thee to thy father forthwith I will goe.                       85
Nay soft, quoth his kinsmen, it must not be soe;
A poor beggars daughter noe ladye shal bee,
Then take thy adew of pretty Bessee.

But soone after this, by breake of the day
The knight had from Rumford stole Bessy away.                       90
The younge men of Rumford, as thicke [as] might bee,
Rode after to feitch againe pretty Bessee.

As swifte as the winde to ryde they were seene,
Untill they came neare unto Bednall-greene;
And as the knight lighted most courteousl&igrave;e,                        95
They all fought against him for pretty Bessee.

But rescew came speedilye over the plaine,
Or else the young knight for his love had been slaine.
This fray being ended, then straitway he see
His kinsmen come rayling at pretty Bessee.                         100

Then spake the blind beggar, Although I bee poore,
Yett rayle not against my child at my own doore:
Though shee be not decked in velvett and pearle,
Yett will I dropp angells with you for my girle.[Pg 178]

And then, if my gold may better her birthe,                        105
And equall the gold that you lay on the earth,
Then neyther rayle nor grudge you to see
The blind beggars daughter a lady to bee.

But first you shall promise, and have itt well knowne,
The gold that you drop shall all be your owne.                     110
With that they replyed, Contented bee wee.
Then here's, quoth the beggar, for pretty Bessee.

With that an angell he cast on the ground,
And dropped in angels full three thousand[571] pound;
And oftentimes itt was proved most plaine,                         115
For the gentlemens one the beggar dropt twayne:

Soe that the place, wherin they did sitt,
With gold it was covered every whitt.
The gentlemen then having dropt all their store,
Sayd, Now, beggar, hold, for wee have noe more.                    120

Thou hast fulfilled thy promise arright.
Then marry, quoth he, my girle to this knight;
And heere, added hee, I will now throwe you downe
A hundred pounds more to buy her a gowne.

The gentlemen all, that this treasure had seene,                   125
Admired the beggar of Bednall-greene:
And all those, that were her suitors before,
Their fleshe for very anger they tore.

Thus was faire Besse matched to the knight,
And then made a ladye in others despite:                           130
A fairer ladye there never was seene,
Than the blind beggars daughter of Bednall-greene.
[Pg 179]
But of their sumptuous marriage and feast,
What brave lords and knights thither were prest,
The second fitt[572] shall set forth to your sight                 135
With marveilous pleasure, and wished delight.




Part the Second.



  



Off a blind beggars daughter most bright,
That late was betrothed unto a younge knight;
All the discourse therof you did see;
But now comes the wedding of pretty Bessee.

Within a gorgeous palace most brave,                                 5
Adorned with all the cost they cold have,
This wedding was kept most sumptuousl&igrave;e,
And all for the creditt of pretty Bessee.

All kind of dainties, and delicates sweete
Were bought for the banquet, as it was most meete;                  10
Partridge, and plover, and venison most free,
Against the brave wedding of pretty Bessee.

This marriage through England was spread by report,
Soe that a great number therto did resort
Of nobles and gentles in every degree;                              15
And all for the fame of prettye Bessee.

To church then went this gallant younge knight;
His bride followed after, an angell most bright,
With troopes of ladyes, the like nere was seene
As went with sweete Bessy of Bednall-greene.                        20

This marryage being solempnized then,
With musicke performed by the skilfullest men,
The nobles and gentles sate downe at that tyde,
Each one admiring the beautifull bryde.
[Pg 180]
Now, after the sumptuous dinner was done,                           25
To talke, and to reason a number begunn:
They talkt of the blind beggars daughter most bright,
And what with his daughter he gave to the knight.

Then spake the nobles, "Much marveil have wee,
This jolly blind beggar wee cannot here see."                       30
My lords, quoth the bride, my father's so base,
He is loth with his presence these states to disgrace.

"The prayse of a woman in questyon to bringe
Before her own face, were a flattering thinge;
But wee thinke thy father's baseness," quoth they,                  35
"Might by thy bewtye be cleane put awaye."

They had noe sooner these pleasant words spoke,
But in comes the beggar cladd in a silke cloke;
A faire velvet capp, and a fether had hee,
And now a musicyan forsooth he wold bee.                            40

He had a daintye lute under his arme,
He touched the strings, which made such a charme,
Saies, Please you to heare any musicke of mee,
Ile sing you a song of pretty Bessee.

With that his lute he twanged straightway,                          45
And thereon begann most sweetlye to play;
And after that lessons were playd two or three,
He strayn'd out this song most delicatel&igrave;e.

"A poore beggars daughter did dwell on a greene,
Who for her fairenesse might well be a queene:                      50
A blithe bonny lasse, and a daintye was shee,
And many one called her pretty Bessee.

"Her father hee had noe goods, nor noe land.
But beggd for a penny all day with his hand;
And yett to her marriage hee gave thousands three,[573]             55
And still he hath somewhat for pretty Bessee.
[Pg 181]
"And if any one here her birth doe disdaine,
Her father is ready, with might and with maine,
To proove shee is come of noble degree:
Therfore never flout att prettye Bessee."                           60

With that the lords and the companye round
With harty laughter were readye to swound;
Att last said the lords, Full well wee may see,
The bride and the beggar's behoulden to thee.

On this the bride all blushing did rise,                            65
The pearlie dropps standing within her faire eyes,
O pardon my father, grave nobles, quoth shee,
That throughe blind affection thus doteth on mee.

If this be thy father, the nobles did say,
Well may he be proud of this happy day;                             70
Yett by his countenance well may wee see,
His birth and his fortune did never agree:

And therfore, blind man, we pray thee bewray,
(And looke that the truth thou to us doe say)
Thy birth and thy parentage, what itt may bee;                      75
For the love that thou bearest to pretty Bessee."

"Then give me leave, nobles and gentles, each one,
One song more to sing, and then I have done;
And if that itt may not winn good report,
Then doe not give me a groat for my sport.                   80

"[Sir Simon de Montfort my subject shal bee;
Once chiefe of all the great barons was hee,
Yet fortune so cruelle this lorde did abase,
Now loste and forgotten are hee and his race.

"When the barons in armes did king Henrye oppose,
Sir Simon de Montfort their leader they chose;                      86
A leader of courage undaunted was hee,
And oft-times he made their enemyes flee.[Pg 182]

"At length in the battle on Eveshame plaine[574]
The barons were routed, and Montfort was slaine;                    90
Moste fatall that battel did prove unto thee,
Thoughe thou wast not borne then, my prettye Bessee!

"Along with the nobles, that fell at that tyde,
His eldest son Henrye, who fought by his side,
Was fellde by a blowe, he receivde in the fight!                    95
A blowe that deprivde him for ever of sight.

"Among the dead bodyes all lifelesse he laye,
Till evening drewe on of the following daye,
When by a yong ladye discoverd was hee;
And this was thy mother, my prettye Bessee!                        100

"A baron's faire daughter stept forth in the nighte
To search for her father, who fell in the fight,
And seeing yong Montfort, where gasping he laye,
Was moved with pitye, and brought him awaye.

"In secrette she nurst him, and swaged his paine,                  105
While he throughe the realme was beleevd to be slaine:
At lengthe his faire bride she consented to bee,
And made him glad father of prettye Bessee.

"And nowe lest oure foes our lives sholde betraye,
We clothed ourselves in beggars arraye;                            110
Her jewelles shee solde, and hither came wee:
All our comfort and care was our prettye Bessee.]

"And here have wee lived in fortunes despite,
Thoughe poore, yet contented with humble delighte:
Full forty winters thus have I beene                               115
A silly blind beggar of Bednall-greene.
[Pg 183]
"And here, noble lordes, is ended the song
Of one, that once to your own ranke did belong:
And thus have you learned a secrette from mee,
That ne'er had beene knowne, but for prettye Bessee."              120

Now when the faire companye everye one,
Had heard the strange tale in the song he had showne,
They all were amazed, as well they might bee,
Both at the blinde beggar, and pretty Bessee.

With that the faire bride they all did embrace,                    125
Saying, Sure thou art come of an honourable race,
Thy father likewise is of noble degree,
And thou art well worthy a lady to bee.

Thus was the feast ended with joye and delighte,
A bridegroome most happy then was the young knighte,               130
In joy and felicitie long lived hee,
All with his faire ladye, the pretty Bessee.

[The following stanzas (ll. 217-240 of the whole ballad),
were rejected by Percy in favour of the verses above
which are between brackets, and were written by
Robert Dodsley, the bookseller and author:&mdash;


"When ffirst our king his ffame did Advance,
&amp; fought for his title in delicate ffrance,
in many a place many perills past hee:
then was not borne my pretty Bessye.

"And then in those warres went over to fight
many a braue duke, a Lord, &amp; a Knight,
&amp; with them younge Mountford, his courage most free:
but then was not borne my pretty Bessye.

"Att Bloyes there chanced a terrible day,
where many braue ffrenchmen vpon the ground Lay;[Pg 184]
amonge them Lay Mountford for companye:
but then was not borne my pretty Bessye.[575]

"But there did younge Mountford, by blow on the face,
loose both his eyes in a very short space;
&amp; alsoe his liffe had beene gone with his sight,
had not a younge woman come forth in the night

"Amongst the slaine men, as fancy did moue,
to search &amp; to seeke for her owne true loue;
&amp; seeing young Mountford there gasping to bee,
shee saued his liffe through charitye.

"And then all our vittalls, in Beggar attire
att hands of good people wee then did require.
att last into England, as now it is seene,
wee came, &amp; remained att Bednall greene."[576]






&dagger;&Dagger;&dagger; The word fit for part, often occurs in our ancient ballads
and metrical romances: which being divided into several parts for
the convenience of singing them at public entertainments, were in
the intervals of the feast sung by fits, or intermissions. So Puttenham
in his Art of English Poesie, 1589, says: "the Epithalamie
was divided by breaches into three partes to serve for three several
fits, or times to be sung." P. 41.

From the same writer we learn some curious particulars relative
to the state of ballad-singing in that age, that will throw light on
the present subject: speaking of the quick returns of one manner
of tune in the short measures used by common rhymers; these, he
says, "glut the eare, unless it be in small and popular musickes,
sung by these Cantabanqui, upon benches and barrels heads,
where they have none other audience then boys or countrey
fellowes, that passe by them in the streete; or else by blind
harpers, or such like taverne minstrels, that give a fit of mirth for
a groat, ... their matter being for the most part stories of old
time, as the tale of Sir Topas, the reportes of Bevis of Southampton,
Guy of Warwicke, Adam Bell and Clymme of the Clough, and
such other old romances or historical rimes, made purposely for
recreation of the common people at Christmasse dinners and
brideales, and in tavernes and alehouses, and such other places of
base resorte." P. 69.

This species of entertainment, which seems to have been
handed down from the ancient bards, was in the time of Puttenham
[Pg 185]falling into neglect; but that it was not, even then, wholly excluded
from more genteel assemblies, he gives us room to infer from
another passage: "We ourselves," says this courtly[577] writer, "have
written for pleasure a little brief romance, or historical ditty in
the English tong of the Isle of Great Britaine in short and long
meetres, and by breaches or divisions (i.e. fits), to be more commodiously
sung to the harpe in places of assembly, where the company
shal be desirous to heare of old adventures, and valiaunces
of noble knights in times past, as are those of King Arthur and
his Knights of the Round Table, Sir Bevys of Southampton, Guy
of Warwicke, and others like." P. 33.

In more ancient times no grand scene of festivity was compleat
without one of these reciters to entertain the company with feats
of arms, and tales of knighthood, or, as one of these old minstrels
says, in the beginning of an ancient romance on Guy and Colbronde,
in the Editor's folio MS. p. 349 [ed. Hales and Furnivall,
vol. ii., p. 527]:


"When meate and drinke is great plenty&egrave;,
And lords and ladyes still wil bee,
And sitt and solace lythe;[578]
Then itt is time for mee to speake
Of keene knightes, and kemp&egrave;s great,
Such carping for to kythe."




If we consider that a groat in the age of Elizabeth was more
than equivalent to a shilling now, we shall find that the old
harpers were even then, when their art was on the decline, upon a
far more reputable footing than the ballad-singers of our time.
The reciting of one such ballad as this of the Beggar of Bednal
Green, in two parts, was rewarded with half-a-crown of our
money. And that they made a very respectable appearance, we
may learn from the dress of the old beggar, in the preceding
ballad, p. 178, where he comes into company in the habit and
character of one of these minstrels, being not known to be the
bride's father till after her speech, ver. 63. The exordium of his
song, and his claiming a groat for his reward, v. 76, are peculiarly
characteristic of that profession. Most of the old ballads begin
in a pompous manner, in order to captivate the attention of the
audience, and induce them to purchase a recital of the song: and
they seldom conclude the first part without large promises of still
[Pg 186]greater entertainment in the second. This was a necessary piece
of art to incline the hearers to be at the expense of a second
groat's-worth. Many of the old romances extend to eight or nine
fits, which would afford a considerable profit to the reciter.

To return to the word fit; it seems at one time to have
peculiarly signified the pause, or breathing-time, between the
several parts (answering to Passus in the Visions of Pierce Plowman):
thus in the ancient ballad of Chevy-Chase (vol. i. p. 27), the
first part ends with this line:


"The first fit here I fynde:"




i.e. here I come to the first pause or intermission. (See also vol. i.
p. 44.) By degrees it came to signify the whole part or division
preceding the pause. (See vol. i. pp. 162, 169.) This sense it
had obtained so early as the time of Chaucer; who thus concludes
the first part of his rhyme of Sir Thopas (writ in ridicule of the
old ballad romances):&mdash;


"Lo! lordis mine, here is a fitt;
If ye woll any more of it,
To tell it woll I fonde."




The word fit indeed appears originally to have signified a poetic
strain, verse, or poem; for in these senses it is used by the Anglo-Saxon
writers. Thus K. &AElig;lfred in his Boethius, having given a
version of lib. 3, metr. 5, adds, &ETH;a &#xA785;e p&iota;&#xA785;&#xA77A;om &thorn;a &thorn;a&#xA785; &#xA77C;&iota;&#xA787;&#xA787;e
a&#xA785;un&#541;en h&aelig;&#xA77C;&#xA77A;e, p. 65, i.e. "When wisdom had sung these (Fitts)
verses." And in the proem to the same book, Fon on &#xA77C;&iota;&#xA787;&#xA787;e, "Put
into (fitt) verse." So in Cedmon, p. 45. Feon&#xA77A; on &#xA77C;&iota;&#xA787;&#xA787;e, seems
to mean "composed a song," or "poem." The reader will trace
this old Saxon phrase, in the application of the word fond, in the
foregoing passage of Chaucer.

Spencer has used the word fit to denote "a strain of music;"
see his poem, intitled, Collin Clout's come home again, where he
says:&mdash;


"The Shepherd of the ocean [Sir Walt. Raleigh]
Provoked me to play some pleasant fit.
And when he heard the music which I made
He found himself full greatlye pleas'd at it," &amp;c.




It is also used in the old ballad of K. Estmere, vol. i. book 1,
No. 6, v. 243.

From being applied to music, this word was easily transferred to
dancing; thus in the old play of Lusty Juventus (described in preliminary
note to book 2, No. 1 in this volume), Juventus says:


"By the masse I would fayne go daunce a fitte."

[Pg 187]


And from being used as a part or division in a ballad, poem, &amp;c.
it is applied by Bale to a section or chapter in a book (though I
believe in a sense of ridicule or sarcasm), for thus he intitles two
chapters of his English Votaryes, part 2nd, viz. fol. 49, "The fyrst
fytt of Anselme with Kynge Wyllyam Rufus;" fol. 50, "An other
Fytt of Anselme with kynge Wyllyam Rufus."

XI.

FANCY AND DESIRE.


By the Earl of Oxford.



  

Edward Vere, Earl of Oxford, was in high fame for
his poetical talents in the reign of Elizabeth; perhaps
it is no injury to his reputation that few of his compositions
are preserved for the inspection of impartial
posterity. To gratify curiosity, we have inserted a sonnet of his,
which is quoted with great encomiums for its "excellencie and
wit," in Puttenham's Arte of Eng. Poesie,[579] and found intire in the
Garland of Good-will. A few more of his sonnets (distinguished
by the initial letters E. O.), may be seen in the Paradise of Daintie
Devises. One of these is intitled The Complaint of a Lover,
wearing blacke and tawnie. The only lines in it worth notice are
these:&mdash;


"A crowne of baies shall that man 'beare'
Who triumphs over me;
For black and tawnie will I weare,
Which mourning colours be."


We find in Hall's Chronicle, that when Q. Catharine of Arragon
dyed, Jan. 8, 1536, "Queen Anne (Bullen) ware yellowe for the
mourning." And when this unfortunate princess lost her head,
May 19, the same year, "on the ascencion day following, the kyng
for mourning ware whyte." Fol. 227, 228.

Edward, who was the seventeenth earl of Oxford, of the family
[Pg 188]of Vere, succeeded his father in his title and honours in 1563, and
died an aged man in 1604. See Mr. Walpole's Noble Authors.
Athen. Oxon, &amp;c.





[Walpole was in error when he stated that Lord Oxford died an
aged man, for that nobleman was only about sixty at the time of
his death. Sir Egerton Brydges points out in his edition of the
Paradise of Dainty Devices (British Bibliographer, vol. iii.), that
the earl could not have been born earlier than 1540 or 1541,
because his elder half-sister Katherine, widow of Edward, Lord
Windsor, died in January, 1599, aged 60. The chief events of his
life are these. In 1585 he was the chief of those who embarked
with the Earl of Leicester for the relief of the states of Holland
and Zealand. In 1586 he sat as Lord Great Chamberlain of England
on the trial of Mary, Queen of Scots. In 1588 he hired and
fitted out ships at his own charge against the Spanish Armada. In
1589 he sat on the trial of Philip Howard, Earl of Arundel, and
in 1601 on the trials of the Earls of Essex and Southampton.
His private character was far from good, and his honour was tarnished
by his dispute with Sir Philip Sidney. He used his first
wife (a daughter of the great Burleigh) cruelly, in revenge for the
statesman's treatment of his great friend, Thomas, Duke of Norfolk.
In his early youth he travelled in Italy, and returned from
that country a finished coxcomb, bringing home with him Italian
dresses, perfumes, and embroidered gloves. He presented a pair
of the latter to Queen Elizabeth, who was so pleased with them
that she was drawn with them on her hands. The earl was buried
at Hackney, on the 6th of July, 1604.

Percy might have spared rather more praise for this pretty little
poem.]




  



Come hither shepherd's swayne:
"Sir, what do you require?"
I praye thee, shewe to me thy name.
"My name is Fond Desire."

When wert thou borne, Desire?                                        5
"In pompe and pryme of may."
By whom, sweet boy, wert thou begot?
"By fond Conceit men say."[Pg 189]

Tell me, who was thy nurse?
"Fresh Youth in sugred joy."                                      10
What was thy meate and dayly foode?
"Sad sighes with great annoy."

What hadst thou then to drinke?
"Unsavoury lovers teares."
What cradle wert thou rocked in?                                    15
"In hope devoyde of feares."

What lulld thee then asleepe?
"Sweete speech, which likes me best."
Tell me, where is thy dwelling place?
"In gentle hartes I rest."                                        20

What thing doth please thee most?
"To gaze on beautye stille."
Whom dost thou thinke to be thy foe?
"Disdayn of my good wille."

Doth companye displease?                                            25
"Yes, surelye, many one."
Where doth Desire delighte to live?
"He loves to live alone."

Doth either tyme or age
Bringe him unto decaye?                                           30
"No, no, Desire both lives and dyes
Ten thousand times a daye."

Then, fond Desire, farewelle,
Thou art no mate for mee;
I sholde be lothe, methinkes, to dwelle                             35
With such a one as thee.

XII.

SIR ANDREW BARTON.



  

I cannot give a better relation of the fact which is
the subject of the following ballad, than in an extract
from the late Mr. Guthrie's Peerage,[580] which was begun
upon a very elegant plan, but never finished. Vol. i.
4to. p. 22.

"The transaction which did the greatest honour to the earl of
Surrey[581] and his family at this time (A.D. 1511), was their behaviour
in the case of Barton, a Scotch sea-officer. This gentleman's
father having suffered by sea from the Portuguese, he had obtained
letters of marque for his two sons to make reprisals upon the subjects
of Portugal. It is extremely probable, that the court of
Scotland granted these letters with no very honest intention. The
council board of England, at which the earl of Surrey held the
chief place, was daily pestered with complaints from the sailors
and merchants, that Barton, who was called Sir Andrew Barton,
under pretence of searching for Portuguese goods, interrupted the
English navigation. Henry's situation at that time rendered him
backward from breaking with Scotland, so that their complaints
were but coldly received. The earl of Surrey, however, could not
smother his indignation, but gallantly declared at the council
board, that while he had an estate that could furnish out a ship,
or a son that was capable of commanding one, the narrow seas
should not be infested.

"Sir Andrew Barton, who commanded the two Scotch ships,
had the reputation of being one of the ablest sea officers of his
time. By his depredations, he had amassed great wealth, and his
ships were very richly laden. Henry, notwithstanding his situation,
could not refuse the generous offer made by the earl of
Surrey. Two ships were immediately fitted out, and put to sea
with letters of marque, under his two sons, Sir Thomas[582] and Sir
Edward Howard. After encountering a great deal of foul weather,
[Pg 191]Sir Thomas came up with the 'Lion,' which was commanded by
Sir Andrew Barton in person; and Sir Edward came up with the
'Union,' Barton's other ship (called by Hall, the 'Bark of Scotland.')
The engagement which ensued was extremely obstinate
on both sides; but at last the fortune of the Howards prevailed.
Sir Andrew was killed fighting bravely, and encouraging his men
with his whistle, to hold out to the last; and the two Scotch ships
with their crews, were carried into the river Thames. (Aug. 2,
1511.)

"This exploit had the more merit, as the two English commanders
were in a manner volunteers in the service, by their
father's order. But it seems to have laid the foundation of Sir
Edward's fortune; for, on the 7th of April, 1512, the king constituted
him (according to Dugdale) admiral of England,
Wales, &amp;c.

"King James 'insisted' upon satisfaction for the death of
Barton, and capture of his ship: tho' Henry had generously dismissed
the crews, and even agreed that the parties accused might
appear in his courts of admiralty by their attornies, to vindicate
themselves." This affair was in a great measure the cause of the
battle of Flodden, in which James IV. lost his life.

In the following ballad will be found perhaps some few deviations
from the truth of history; to atone for which it has probably
recorded many lesser facts, which history hath not condescended
to relate. I take many of the little circumstances of the story to
be real, because I find one of the most unlikely to be not very
remote from the truth. In pt. 2, v. 156, it is said, that England
had before "but two ships of war." Now the "Great Harry" had
been built only seven years before, viz. in 1504: which "was
properly speaking the first ship in the English navy. Before this
period, when the prince wanted a fleet, he had no other expedient
but hiring ships from the merchants."&mdash;Hume.

This ballad, which appears to have been written in the reign of
Elizabeth, has received great improvements from the Editor's folio
MS. wherein was an ancient copy, which, though very incorrect,
seemed in many respects superior to the common ballad; the
latter being evidently modernized and abridged from it. The
following text is, however, in some places amended and improved
by the latter (chiefly from a black-letter copy in the Pepys collection),
as also by conjecture.





[There is little to be added to the above preface, but those who
wish to read the Scottish version will find John Lesley's (Bishop
of Ross) account of the affair (Historie of Scotland, 1436-1561),
quoted in Mr. Furnivall's full preface to the ballad in the folio MS.
(vol. iii. p. 399). Percy fully explains how he made up his copy.[Pg 192]
There is, in fact, hardly a line that has not been altered, and the
notes at the foot of the page give the reader no idea of the
changes that have been made. To have noted all the differences
would have loaded the page unnecessarily, and therefore in consideration
of the interest of the ballad, a reprint of the folio copy
has been added, although there are several printed copies. It is
difficult to understand what could have induced Percy to reject
the pretty lines:


"As itt beffell in Midsummer time
When burds singe sweetlye on every tree,"




for the incongruous opening of Flora with her flowers, and
Neptune with his showers. The greatest alterations are in vv.
33-40, 129-136; part 2, vv. 1-8, 17-64, 89-94, 113-120, 145-176.]



The First Part.



  



When Flora with her fragrant flowers
'Bedeckt the earth so trim and gaye,
'And Neptune with his daintye showers
'Came to present the monthe of Maye;'[583]
King Henrye rode to take the ayre,                                   5
Over the river of Thames past hee;
When eighty merchants of London came,
And downe they knelt upon their knee.

"O yee are welcome, rich merch&agrave;nts;
Good saylors, welcome unto mee."                                  10
They swore by the rood, they were saylors good,
But rich merch&agrave;nts they cold not bee:
"To France nor Flanders dare we pass:
Nor Bourdeaux voyage dare we fare;
And all for a rover that lyes on the seas,[584]                     15
Who robbs us of our merchant ware."
[Pg 193]
King Henrye frownd, and turned him rounde,
And swore by the Lord, that was mickle of might,
"I thought he had not beene in the world,
Durst have wrought England such unright."                         20
The merchants sighed, and said, alas!
And thus they did their answer frame,
He is a proud Scott, that robbs on the seas,
And Sir Andrewe Barton is his name.

The king lookt over his left should&egrave;r,                              25
And an angrye look then looked hee:
"Have I never a lorde in all my realme,
Will feitch yond traytor unto mee?"
Yea, that dare I; lord Howard sayes;[585]
Yea, that dare I with heart and hand;                             30
If it please your grace to give me leave,
Myselfe wil be the only man.

Thou art but yong; the kyng replyed:
Yond Scott hath numbred manye a yeare.
"Trust me, my liege, Ile make him quail,                            35
Or before my prince I will never appeare."
Then bowemen and gunners thou shalt have,
And chuse them over my realme so free;
Besides good mariners, and shipp-boyes,
To guide the great shipp on the sea.                              40

The first man, that lord Howard chose,
Was the ablest gunner in all the realm,
Thoughe he was threescore yeeres and ten:
Good Peter Simon was his name.
Peter, sais hee, I must to the sea,                                 45
To bring home a traytor live or dead:
Before all others I have chosen thee;
Of a hundred gunners to be the head.
[Pg 194]
If you, my lord, have chosen mee
Of a hundred gunners to be the head,                              50
Then hang me up on your maine-mast tree,
If I misse my marke one shilling bread.[586]
My lord then chose a boweman rare,
Whose active hands had gained fame.[587]
In Yorkshire was this gentleman borne,                              55
And William Horseley was his name.[588]

Horseley, sayd he, I must with speede
Go seeke a traytor on the sea,
And now of a hundred bowemen brave
To be the head I have chosen thee.                                60
If you, quoth hee, have chosen mee
Of a hundred bowemen to be the head;
On your maine-m&agrave;st Ile hanged bee,
If I miss twelvescore one penny bread.[586]

With pikes and gunnes, and bowemen bold,                            65
This noble Howard is gone to the sea;
With a valyant heart and a pleasant cheare,
Out at Thames mouth sayled he.
And days he scant had sayled three,
Upon the 'voyage' he tooke in hand,[589]                          70
But there he mett with a noble shipp,
And stoutely made itt stay and stand.

Thou must tell me, lord Howard said,
Now who thou art, and what's thy name;
And shewe me where thy dwelling is:                                 75
And whither bound, and whence thou came.
My name is Henry Hunt, quoth hee[Pg 195]
With a heavye heart, and a carefull mind;
I and my shipp doe both belong
To the Newcastle, that stands upon Tyne.                          80

Hast thou not heard, nowe, Henrye Hunt,
As thou hast sayled by daye and by night,
Of a Scottish rover on the seas;[584]
Men call him sir Andrew Barton, knight?
Then ever he sighed, and sayd alas!                                 85
With a grieved mind, and well away!
But over-well I knowe that wight,
I was his prisoner yesterday.

As I was sayling uppon the sea,
A Burdeaux voyage for to fare;                                    90
To his hach-borde he clasped me,[590]
And robd me of all my merchant ware:
And mickle debts, Got wot, I owe,
And every man will have his owne;
And I am nowe to London bounde,                                     95
Of our gracious king to beg a boone.

That shall not need, lord Howard sais;
Lett me but once that robber see,
For every penny tane thee froe
It shall be doubled shillings three.                             100
Nowe God forefend, the merchant said,
That you shold seek soe far amisse!
God keepe you out of that traitors hands!
Full litle ye wott what a man hee is.

Hee is brasse within, and steele without,                          105
With beames on his topcastle stronge;
And eighteen pieces of ordinance
He carries on each side along:
And he hath a pinnace deerlye dight,[591][Pg 196]
St. Andrewes crosse that is his guide;                           110
His pinnace beareth ninescore men,
And fifteen canons on each side.

Were ye twentye shippes, and he but one;
I sweare by kirke, and bower, and hall;
He wold overcome them everye one,                                  115
If once his beames they doe downe fall.[592]
This is cold comfort, sais my lord,
To wellcome a stranger thus to the sea:
Yet Ile bring him and his shipp to shore,
Or to Scottland hee shall carrye mee.                            120

Then a noble gunner you must have,
And he must aim well with his ee,
And sinke his pinnace into the sea,
Or else hee never orecome will bee:
And if you chance his shipp to borde,                              125
This counsel I must give withall,
Let no man to his topcastle goe
To strive to let his beams downe fall.

And seven pieces of ordinance,
I pray your honour lend to mee,                                  130
On each side of my shipp along,
And I will lead you on the sea.
A glasse Ile sett, that may be seene,[Pg 197]
Whether you sayle by day or night,
And to-morrowe, I sweare, by nine of the clocke                    135
You shall meet with Sir Andrewe Barton knight.




The Second Part.



  



The merchant sett my lorde a glasse
Soe well apparent in his sight,
And on the morrowe, by nine of the clocke,
He shewed him Sir Andrewe Barton knight.
His hachebord it was 'gilt' with gold,[593]                          5
Soe deerlye dight it dazzled the ee:
Nowe by my faith, lord Howarde sais,
This is a gallant sight to see.

Take in your ancyents,[594] standards eke,
So close that no man may them see;                                10
And put me forth a white willowe wand,
As merchants use to sayle the sea.
But they stirred neither top, nor mast;[595]
Stoutly they past Sir Andrew by.
What English churles are yonder, he sayd,                           15
That can soe litle curtesye?

Now by the roode, three yeares and more
I have beene admirall over the sea;
And never an English nor Portingall
Without my leave can passe this way.                              20
Then called he forth his stout pinn&agrave;ce;
"Fetch backe yond pedlars nowe to mee:
I sweare by the masse, yon English churles
Shall all hang att my maine-mast tree."
[Pg 198]
With that the pinnace itt shott off,                                25
Full well lord Howard might it ken;
For itt stroke down my lord's fore mast,
And killed fourteen of his men.
Come hither, Simon, sayes my lord,
Looke that thy word be true, thou said;                           30
For at my maine-mast thou shalt hang,
If thou misse thy marke one shilling bread.

Simon was old, but his heart itt was bold.
His ordinance he laid right lowe;
He put in chaine full nine yardes long,[596]                        35
With other great shott lesse, and moe;
And he lette goe his great gunnes shott;
Soe well he settled itt with his ee,
The first sight that Sir Andrew sawe,
He see his pinnace sunke in the sea.                              40

And when he saw his pinnace sunke,
Lord, how his heart with rage did swell!
"Nowe cutt my ropes, itt is time to be gon;
Ile fetch yond pedlars backe mysell."
When my Lord sawe Sir Andrewe loose,                                45
Within his heart hee was full faine:
"Nowe spread your ancyents, strike up drummes,
Sound all your trumpetts out amaine."

Fight on, my men, Sir Andrewe sais,
Weale howsoever this geere will sway;                             50
Itt is my lord admirall of Engl&agrave;nd,
Is come to seeke mee on the sea.
Simon had a sonne, who shott right well,
That did Sir Andrewe mickle scare;
In att his decke he gave a shott,                                   55
Killed threescore of his men of warre.
[Pg 199]
Then Henrye Hunt with rigour hott
Came bravely on the other side,
Soone he drove downe his fore-mast tree,
And killed fourscore men beside.                                  60
Nowe, out alas! Sir Andrewe cryed,
What may a man now thinke, or say?
Yonder merchant theefe, that pierceth mee,
He was my prisoner yesterday.

Come hither to me, thou Gordon good,                                65
That aye wast readye att my call;
I will give thee three hundred markes,[597]
If thou wilt let my beames downe fall.
Lord Howard hee then calld in haste,
"Horseley see thou be true in stead;                              70
For thou shalt at the maine-mast hang,
If thou misse twelvescore one penny bread."

Then Gordon swarved[598] the maine-mast tree,
He swarved it with might and maine;
But Horseley with a bearing arrowe,[599]                            75
Stroke the Gordon through the braine;
And he fell unto the haches again,
And sore his deadlye wounde did bleed:
Then word went through Sir Andrews men,
How that the Gordon hee was dead.                                 80

Come hither to mee, James Hambilton,
Thou art my only sisters sonne,
If thou wilt let my beames downe fall,
Six hundred nobles thou hast wonne.
With that he swarved the maine-mast tree,                           85
He swarved it with nimble art;
But Horseley with a broad arr&ograve;we
Pierced the Hambilton through the heart:
[Pg 200]
And downe he fell upon the deck,
That with his blood did streame amaine:                           90
Then every Scott cryed, Well-away!
Alas a comelye youth is slaine!
All woe begone was Sir Andrew then,
With griefe and rage his heart did swell:
"Go fetch me forth my armour of proofe,                             95
For I will to the topcastle mysell.

"Goe fetch me forth my armour of proofe;
That gilded is with gold soe cleare:
God be with my brother John of Barton!
Against the Portingalls hee it ware;                             100
And when he had on this armour of proofe,
He was a gallant sight to see:
Ah! nere didst thou meet with living wight,
My deere broth&egrave;r, could cope with thee."

Come hither Horseley, sayes my lord,                               105
And looke your shaft that itt goe right,
Shoot a good shoote in time of need,
And for it thou shalt be made a knight.
Ile shoot my best, quoth Horseley then,
Your honour shall see, with might and maine;                     110
But if I were hanged at your maine-mast,
I have now left but arrowes twaine.

Sir Andrew he did swarve the tree,
With right good will he swarved then:
Upon his breast did Horseley hitt,                                 115
But the arrow bounded back agen.
Then Horseley spyed a privye place
With a perfect eye in a secrette part;
Under the spole[600] of his right arme
He smote Sir Andrew to the heart.                                120
[Pg 201]
"Fight on, my men, Sir Andrew sayes,
A little Ime hurt, but yett not slaine;
Ile but lye downe and bleede a while,
And then Ile rise and fight againe.
Fight on, my men, Sir Andrew sayes,                                125
And never flinche before the foe;
And stand fast by St. Andrewes crosse
Untill you heare my whistle blowe."[601]

They never heard his whistle blow,&mdash;&mdash;
Which made their hearts waxe sore adread:                        130
Then Horseley sayd, Aboard, my lord,
For well I wott Sir Andrew's dead.
They boarded then his noble shipp,
They boarded it with might and maine;
Eighteen score Scots alive they found,                             135
The rest were either maimed or slaine.

Lord Howard tooke a sword in hand,
And off he smote Sir Andrewes head;
"I must have left England many a daye,
If thou wert alive as thou art dead."                            140
He caused his body to be cast
Over the hatchbord into the sea,
And about his middle three hundred crownes:
"Wherever thou land this will bury thee."

Thus from the warres lord Howard came,                             145
And backe he sayled ore the maine,
With mickle joy and triumph&igrave;ng
Into Thames mouth he came againe.
Lord Howard then a letter wrote,
And sealed it with seale and ring;                               150
"Such a noble prize have I brought to your grace,
As never did subject to a king.
[Pg 202]
"Sir Andrewes shipp I bring with mee;
A braver shipp was never none:
Nowe hath your grace two shipps of warr,                           155
Before in England was but one."
King Henryes grace with royall cheere
Welcomed the noble Howard home,
And where, said he, is this rover stout,
That I myselfe may give the doome?                               160

"The rover, he is safe, my leige,
Full many a fadom in the sea;
If he were alive as he is dead,
I must have left England many a day:
And your grace may thank four men i' the ship                      165
For the victory wee have wonne,
These are William Horseley, Henry Hunt,
And Peter Simon, and his sonne."

To Henry Hunt, the king then sayd,
In lieu of what was from thee tane,                              170
A noble a day now thou shalt have,
Sir Andrewes jewels and his chayne.
And Horseley thou shalt be a knight,
And lands and livings shalt have store;
Howard shall be erle Surrye hight,[602]                            175
As Howards erst have beene before.[602]

Nowe, Peter Simon, thou art old,
I will maintaine thee and thy sonne:
And the men shall have five hundred markes
For the good service they have done.                             180
Then in came the queene with ladyes fair
To see Sir Andrewe Barton knight:
They weend that hee were brought on shore,
And thought to have seen a gallant sight.
[Pg 203]
But when they see his deadlye face,                                185
And eyes soe hollow in his head,
I wold give, quoth the king, a thousand markes,
This man were alive as hee is dead:
Yett for the manfull part hee playd,
Which fought soe well with heart and hand,                       190
His men shall have twelvepence a day,
Till they come to my brother kings high land.

[The following version is reprinted from Hales and Furnivall's
edition of the folio MS., vol. iii. p. 403:&mdash;


As: itt beffell in M&iota;dsumer time
when burds singe sweetlye on euery tree,
our noble King, King Henery the 8th,
ouer the riuer of Thames past hee.                                 4
hee was no sooner ouer the riuer,
downe in a fforrest to take the ayre,
but 80 merchants of London cittye
came kneeling before King Henery there:                            8

"O yee are welcome, rich merchants,
[Good saylors, welcome unto me!"]
they swore by the rood th&eacute; were saylers good,
but rich merchants they cold not bee;                             12
"to ffrance nor fflanders dare we nott passe,
nor Burdeaux voyage wee dare not ffare,
&amp; all ffor a ffalse robber that lyes on the seas,
&amp; robb vs of our merchants ware."                                 16

King Henery was stout, &amp; he turned him about,
&amp; swore by the Lord that was mickle of might,
"I thought he had not beene in the world throughout,
that durst haue wrought England such vnright."                    20
but euer they sighed, and said&mdash;alas!&mdash;
vnto King Harry this answere againe
"he is a proud Scott that will robb vs all
if wee were 20 shipps and hee but one."                           24

The King looket ouer his left shoulder,
amongst his Lords &amp; Barrons soe ffree:
"haue I neuer Lord in all my realme
will ffeitch yond traitor vnto mee?"                              28[Pg 204]
"yes, that dare I!" sayes my Lord Chareles Howard,
neere to the King wheras hee did stand;
"If that your grace will giue me leaue,
my selfe wilbe the only man."                                     32

"thou shalt haue 600 men," saith our King,
"&amp; chuse them out of my realme soe ffree;
besids Marriners and boyes,
to guide the great shipp on the sea."                             36
"Ile goe speake with Sir Andrew," sais Charles, my Lord Haward;
"vpon the sea, if hee be there,
I will bring him &amp; his shipp to shore,
or before my prince I will neuer come neere."                     40

the ffirst of all my Lord did call,
a noble gunner hee was one;
this man was 60 yeeres and ten,
&amp; Peeter Simon was his name.                                      44
"Peeter," sais hee, "I must sayle to the sea
to seeke out an enemye; god be my speed!
before all others I haue chosen thee;
of a 100^{d}. guners thoust be my head."                          48

"my Lord," sais hee," if you haue chosen mee
of a 100d. gunners to be the head,
hange me att your maine-mast tree
if I misse my marke past 3 pence bread."                          52
The next of all my Lord he did call,
a noble bowman hee was one;
In yorekeshire was this gentleman borne,
&amp; william Horsley was his name.                                   56

"Horsley," sayes hee, "I must sayle to the sea
to seeke out an enemye; god be my speede!
before all others I haue chosen thee;
of a 100 bowemen thoust be my head."                              60
"My Lord," sais hee," if you haue chosen mee
of a 100d. bowemen to be they head,
hang me att your mainemast tree
if I misse my marke past 12^{d}. bread."                          64

with pikes, and gunnes, &amp; bowemen bold,
this Noble Howard is gone to the sea
on the day before Midsummer euen,
&amp; out att Thames mouth sayled they.                               68
They had not sayled dayes 3
vpon their Iourney they tooke in hand,
but there they mett with a Noble shipp,
&amp; stoutely made itt both stay &amp; stand.                            72[Pg 205]

"thou must tell me thy name," sais Charles, my Lord Haward,
"or who thou art, or ffrom whence thou came,
yea, &amp; where thy dwelling is,
to whom &amp; where thy shipp does belong."                           76
"My name," sayes hee," is Henery Hunt,
with a pure hart &amp; a penitent mind;
I and my shipp they doe belong
vnto the New castle that stands vpon tine."                       80

"Now thou must tell me, Harry Hunt,
as thou hast sayled by day &amp; by night,
hast thou not heard of a stout robber?
men calls him Sir Andrew Bartton, Knight."                        84
but euer he sighed, &amp; sayd, "alas!
ffull well, my Lord, I know that wight!
he robd me of my merchants ware,
&amp; I was his prisoner but yesternight.                             88

"as I was sayling vppon the sea,
&amp; Burdeaux voyage as I did ffare,
he Clasped me to his Archborde
&amp; robd me of all my merchants ware;                               92
&amp; I am a man both poore &amp; bare,
&amp; euery man will haue his owne of me,
&amp; I am bound towards London to ffare,
to complaine to my Prince Henerye."                               96

"that shall not need," sais my Lord Haward;
"if thou canst lett me this robber see,
ffor euery peny he hath taken thee ffroe,
thou shalt be rewarded a shilling," quoth hee.                   100
"Now god ffore-fend," saies Henery Hunt,
"my Lord, you shold worke soe ffarr amisse!
god keepe you out of that Traitors hands!
for you wott ffull litle what a man hee is.                      104

"hee is brasse within, &amp; steele without,
&amp; beanes hee beares in his Topcastle stronge;
his shipp hath ordinance cleane round about;
besids, my Lord, hee is verry well mand;                         108
he hath a pinnace is deerlye dight,
Saint Andrews crosse, that is his guide;
his pinnace beares 9 score men &amp; more,
besids 15 cannons on euery side.                                 112

"if you were 20 shippes, &amp; he but one,
either in charke-bord or in hall,
he wold ouercome you euerye one,
&amp; if his beanes they doe downe ffall."                           116[Pg 206]

"this is cold comfort," sais my Lord Haward,
"to wellcome a stranger thus to the sea;
He bring him &amp; his shipp to shore,
or else into Scottland hee shall carrye mee."                    120

"then you must gett a noble gunner, my Lord,
that can sett well with his eye
&amp; sinke his pinnace into the sea,
&amp; soone then ouercome will hee bee                               124
&amp; when that you haue done this,
if you chance Sir Andrew for to bord,
lett no man to his Topcastle goe;
&amp; I will giue you a glasse, my Lord,                             128

"&amp; then you need to fferae no Scott,
whether you sayle by day or by night;
&amp; to-morrow by 7 of the clocke,
you shall meete with Sir Andrew Bartton, Knight.                 132
I was his prisoner but yester night,
&amp; he hath taken mee sworne;" quoth hee,
"I trust my L[ord] god will me fforgiue
&amp; if that oath then broken bee.                                  136

"you must lend me sixe peeces, my Lord," quoth hee,
"into my shipp to sayle the sea,
&amp; to-morrow by 9 of the clocke
your honour againe then will I see."                             140
And the hache-bord where Sir Andrew Lay,
is hached with gold deerlye dight:
"now by my ffaith," sais Charles, my Lord Haward,
"then yonder Scott is a worthye wight!"                          144

{ Take in your ancyents &amp; your standards,
2d. parte { &nbsp; &nbsp; yea that no man shall them see,
{ &amp; put me fforth a white willow wand,
{ &nbsp; &nbsp; as Merchants vse to sayle the sea.                148
But they stirred neither top nor mast,
but Sir Andrew they passed by.
"whatt English are yonder," said Sir Andrew,
"that can so litle curtesye?                                     152

"I haue beene Admirall ouer the sea
more then these yeeres three;
there is neuer an English dog, nor Portingall,
can passe this way without leaue of mee.                         156
But now yonder pedlers, they are past,
which is no litle greffe to me:
ffeich them backe," sayes Sir Andrew Bartton,
"they shall all hang att my maine-mast tree."                    160
[Pg 207]
with that they pinnace itt shott of,
that my Lord Haward might itt well ken,
itt strokes downe my Lords fforemast,
&amp; killed 14 of my Lord his men.                                  164
"come hither, Simon!" sayes my Lord Haward,
"looke that thy words be true thou sayd;
Ile hang thee att my maine-mast tree
if thou misse thy marke past 12^d. bread."                       168

Simon was old, but his hart itt was bold,
hee tooke downe a peece, &amp; layd itt ffull lowe;
he put in chaine yeards 9,
besids other great shott lesse and more.                         172
with that hee lett his gun shott goe;
soe well hee settled itt with his eye,
the ffirst sight that Sir Andrew sawe,
hee see his pinnace sunke in the sea.                            176

when hee saw his pinace sunke,
Lord! in his hart hee was not well:
"cutt my ropes! itt is time to be gon!
Ile goe ffeitch yond pedlers backe my selfe!"                    180
when my Lord Haward saw Sir Andrew loose,
lord! in his hart that hee was ffaine:
"strike on your drummes, spread out your ancyents!
sound out your trumpetts! sound out amaine!"                     184

"ffight on, my men!" sais Sir Andrew Bartton;
"weate, howsoeuer this geere will sway,
itt is my Lord Adm&iota;rall of England
is come to seeke mee on the sea."                                188
Simon had a sonne, with shott of a gunn,&mdash;
well Sir Andrew might itt Ken,&mdash;
he shott itt in att a priuye place,
&amp; killed 60 more of Sir Andrews men.                             192

Harry Hunt came in att the other syde,
&amp; att Sir Andrew hee shott then,
he droue downe his fformost tree,
&amp; killed 80 more of Sir Andirwes men.                            196
"I haue done a good turne," sayes Harry Hunt,
"Sir Andrew is not our Kings ffreind;
he hoped to haue vndone me yesternight,
but I hope I haue quitt him well in the end."                    200

"Euer alas!" sayd Sir Andrew Barton,
"what shold a man either thinke or say?
yonder ffalse theeffe is my strongest Enemye,
who was my prisoner but yesterday.                               204[Pg 208]
come hither to me, thou Gourden good,

&amp; I will giue thee 300li.
if thou wilt lett my beanes downe ffall."                        208

with that hee swarned the maine-mast tree,
soe did he itt with might and maine:
Horseley with a bearing arrow
stroke the Gourden through the braine,                           212
And he ffell into the haches againe,
&amp; sore of this wound that he did bleed.
then word went throug Sir Andrews men,
that they Gourden hee was dead.                                  216

"come hither to me, Iames Hambliton,&mdash;
thou art my sisters sonne, I haue no more,&mdash;
I will giue [thee] 600li.
If thou will lett my beanes downe ffall."                        220
with that hee swarned the maine-mast tree,
soe did hee itt with might and maine:
Horseley with an-other broad Arrow
strake the yeaman through the braine,                            224

that hee ffell downe to the haches againe:
sore of his wound that hee did bleed.
itt is verry true, as the welchman sayd,
couetousness getts no gaine.                                     228
but when hee saw his sisters sonne slaine,
Lord! in his heart hee was not well.
"goe ffeitch me downe my armour of proue,
ffor I will to the topcastle my-selfe.                           232

goe ffeitch me downe my armour of prooffe,
for itt is guilded with gold soe cleere.
god be with my brother, Iohn of Bartton!
amongst the Portingalls hee did itt weare."                      236
but when hee had his armour of prooffe,
&amp; on his body hee had itt on,
euery man that looked att him
sayd, "gunn nor arrow hee neede feare none!"                     240

"come hither, Horsley!" sayes my Lord Haward,
"&amp; looke your shaft that itt goe right;
shoot a good shoote in the time of need,
&amp; ffor thy shooting thoust be made a Knight."                    244
"Ile doe my best," sayes Horslay then,
"your honor shall see beffore I goe;
if I shold be hanged att your mainemast,
I haue in my shipp but arrowes tow."                             248[Pg 209]

but att Sir Andrew hee shott then;
hee made sure to hitt his marke;
vnder the spole of his right arme
hee smote Sir Andrew quite throw the hart.                       252
yett ffrom the tree hee wold not start,
but hee clinged to itt with might &amp; maine.
vnder the coller then of his Iacke,
he stroke Sir Andrew thorrow the braine.                         256

"ffight on my men," sayes Sir Andrew Bartton,
"I am hurt, but I am not slaine;
Ile lay mee downe &amp; bleed a-while,
&amp; then Ile rise &amp; ffight againe.                                 260
ffight on my men," sayes Sir Andrew Bartton,
"these English doggs they bite soe lowe;
ffight on ffor Scottland &amp; Saint Andrew
till you heare my whistle blowe!"                                264

but when th&eacute; cold not heare his whistle blow,
sayes Harry Hunt, "Ile lay my head
you may bord yonder noble shipp, my Lord,
for I know Sir Andrew hee is dead."                              268
with that they borded this noble shipp,
soe did they itt with might &amp; maine;
th&eacute; ffound 18 score Scotts aliue,
besids the rest were maimed &amp; slaine.                            272

My Lord Haward tooke a sword in his hand,
&amp; smote of Sir Andrews head.
the Scotts stood by, did weepe &amp; mourne,
but neuer a word durst speake or say.                            276
he caused his body to be taken downe,
&amp; ouer the hatch-bord cast into the sea,
&amp; about his middle 300 crownes:
"wheresoeuer thou lands, itt will bury thee."                    280

with his head they sayled into England againe
with right good will &amp; fforce &amp; meanye,
&amp; the day beffore New yeeres euen
&amp; into Thames mouth againe they came.                            284
My Lord Haward wrote to King Heneryes grace,
with all the newes hee cold him bring:
"such a new yeeres gifft I haue brought to your gr[ace],
As neuer did subiect to any King.                                288

"ffor Merchandyes and Manhood,
the like is nott to be ffound;
the sight of these wold doe you good,
ffor you haue not the Like in your English ground."              292[Pg 210]
but when hee heard tell that they were come,
full royally hee welcomed them home:
Sir Andrews shipp was the Kings New yeeres guifft;
A brauer shipp you neuer saw none.                               296

Now hath our King Sir Andrews shipp
besett with pearles and precyous stones;
Now hath England 2 shipps of warr,
2 shipps of warr, before but one.                                300
"who holpe to this?" sayes King Henerye,
"that I may reward him ffor his paine,"
"Harry Hunt and Peeter Simon,
William Horseleay, &amp; I the same."                                304

"Harry Hunt shall haue his whistle &amp; chaine,
&amp; all his Iewells, whatsoeuer they bee,
&amp; other rich giffts that I will not name,
for his good service he hath done mee.                           308
Horslay, right thoust be a Knight;
Lands and liuings thou shalt haue store.
Howard shalbe Erle of Nottingham,
&amp; soe was neuer Haward before.                                   312

"Now Peeter Simon, thou art old,
I will maintaine thee &amp; thy sonne,
thou shalt haue 500li. all in gold
ffor the good service that thou hast done."                      316
then King Henerye shiffted his roome;
in came the Queene &amp; ladyes bright;
other arrands they had none
but to see Sir Andrew Bartton, Knight.                           320

but when they see his deadly fface,
his eyes were hollow in his head,
"I wold giue a 100li." sais King Henerye,
"the man were aliue as hee is dead!                              324
yett ffor the manfull part that hee hath playd
both heere &amp; beyond the sea
his men shall haue halfe a crowne a day
to bring them to my brother King Iamye."                         328

LADY ANNE BOTHWELL'S LAMENT.


A Scottish Song.



  

The subject of this pathetic ballad the Editor once
thought might possibly relate to the Earl of Bothwell,
and his desertion of his wife Lady Jean Gordon, to
make room for his marriage with the Queen of Scots.

But this opinion he now believes to be groundless; indeed Earl
Bothwell's age, who was upwards of 60 at the time of that marriage,
renders it unlikely that he should be the object of so warm
a passion as this elegy supposes. He has been since informed,
that it entirely refers to a private story: A young lady of the name
of Bothwell, or rather Boswell, having been, together with her child,
deserted by her husband or lover, composed these affecting lines
herself; which here are given from a copy in the Editor's folio MS.
corrected by another in Allan Ramsay's Miscellany.





[The young lady alluded to above has since been set aside for
the Hon. Anne Bothwell, daughter of Adam Bothwell, Bishop of
Orkney. Mr. James Maidment, in his elegant edition of Scottish
Ballads and Songs (vol. ii. 1868), writes: "The late Charles
Kirkpatrick Sharpe, Esquire, whose knowledge of antiquated scandal
was extraordinary, found in a MS. history of the family of Bothwell
by Father Hay, that Adam Bothwell, Bishop of Orkney, had a
daughter named 'Anne, who fell with child to a son of the Earl
of Marre.'" Anne was the sister of the first Lord Holyroodhouse
(created in 1607), and her seducer was Alexander, third son of
John, seventh Earl of Mar, a cousin of her own, considered one of
the handsomest men of his day. This is all very well for conjecture,
but it is nothing more. The ballad does not appear to
have been associated with a Bothwell, or in fact with any named
person, until more than a century after it was written. In the
Folio MS. it is simply called Balowe, and Percy therefore might
well have hesitated before he gave it the heading he has, and before
he Scotticised all the English words. The four earliest versions
are in the following books: 1. Richard Brome's Comedy of the
Northern Lass, or the Nest of Fools, printed in 1632, but acted
somewhat earlier; 2. Percy Folio; 3. Pinkerton's MS. (1625-49),
in the possession of David Laing; 4. John Gamble's MS., 1649;[Pg 212]
5. Elizabeth Rogers' MS., 1658. Mr. Chappell drew up the
following very valuable note for the edition of the Percy Folio
(vol. iii. p. 518), which puts the matter very clearly:&mdash;

"Baloo is a sixteenth-century ballad, not a seventeenth. It is
alluded to by several of our early dramatists, and the tune is to be
found in an early Elizabethan MS. known as William Ballet's Lute
Book, as well as in Morley's Consort Lessons, printed in 1599.
The words and tune are together in John Gamble's Music
Book, a MS. in the possession of Dr. Rimbault, (date 1649,)
and in Elizabeth Rogers's Virginal Book, in the library of the
British Museum (Addit. MS. 10,337). The last is dated 1658,
but the copy may have been taken some few years after. Baloo
was so popular a subject that it was printed as a street ballad,
with additional stanzas, just as 'My lodging it is on the cold
ground' and other popular songs were lengthened for the same
purpose. It has been reprinted in that form by Evans, in his Old
Ballads, Historical and Narrative, edit. 1810, vol. i. p. 259. The
title is 'The New Balow; or A Wenches Lamentation for the loss
of her Sweetheart: he having left her a babe to play with, being
the fruits of her folly.' The particular honour of having been the
'wench' in question was first claimed for 'Lady Anne Bothwell'
in Part iii. of Comic and Serious Scots Poems, published by
Watson in Edinburgh in 1711. Since that date Scotch antiquaries
have been very busy in searching into the scandalous history of the
Bothwell family, to find out which of the Lady Annes might have
been halla-balooing.

"May we not release the whole race from this imputation?
The sole authority for the charge is Watson's Collection! the
same book that ascribes to the unfortunate Montrose the song of
'My dear and only love, take heed,' and tacks it as a second part
to his 'My dear and only love, I pray.' Shade of Montrose! how
must you be ashamed of your over-zealous advocate! Let us
examine whether the spirit of 'Lady Anne Bothwel' has more
reason to be grateful. Among the stanzas ascribed to her by
Watson are the two following, which are not to be found in any
English copy:&mdash;


'I take my fate from best to worse
That I must needs now be a nurse,
And lull my young son in my lap.
From me, sweet orphan, take the pap:
Balow, my boy, thy mother mild
Shall sing, as from all bliss exil'd.'




"In the second we find the inducement supposed to have been
offered by Lady Anne's lover:

[Pg 213]


'I was too credulous at the first
To grant thee that a maiden durst,
And in thy bravery thou didst vaunt
That I no maintenance should want:(!)
Thou swear thou lov'd, thy mind is moved,
Which since no otherwise has proved.'




"Comment is unnecessary. Can any one believe that such
lines were written by or for any lady of rank? Yet they were
copied as Lady Anne's by Allan Ramsay, and polished in his
usual style. They have been polished and repolished by subsequent
editors, but to little avail, for they remain great blots upon
a good English ballad. There is not a Scotch word, nor even one
peculiar to the North of England, in the whole of Watson's version."

This attempt to dispute the Scottish origin of the ballad is
strongly resented by the editor of the Ballad Minstrelsy of Scotland,
Glasgow, 1871. At all events the fact remains that the title
"Lady Anne Bothwell's Balow" cannot be traced farther back
than Watson's Collection, published in 1711.]

FOOTNOTES:



[603] [hush.]



[604] [moaning.]



[605] When sugar was first imported into Europe, it was a very great
dainty; and therefore the epithet sugred is used by all our old
writers metaphorically to express extreme and delicate sweetness.
(See above, No. XI. v. 10.) Sugar at present is cheap and common;
and therefore suggests now a coarse and vulgar idea.

XIV.

THE MURDER OF THE KING OF SCOTS.



  

The catastrophe of Henry Stewart, lord Darnley, the unfortunate
husband of Mary Q. of Scots, is the subject
of this ballad. It is here related in that partial, imperfect
manner in which such an event would naturally
strike the subjects of another kingdom, of which he was a native.
Henry appears to have been a vain, capricious, worthless young
man, of weak understanding, and dissolute morals. But the beauty
of his person, and the inexperience of his youth, would dispose
mankind to treat him with an indulgence, which the cruelty of his
murder would afterwards convert into the most tender pity and
regret: and then imagination would not fail to adorn his memory
with all those virtues he ought to have possessed. This will
account for the extravagant elogium bestowed upon him in the
first stanza, &amp;c.

Henry lord Darnley was eldest son of the earl of Lennox, by
the lady Margaret Douglas, niece of Henry VIII. and daughter
of Margaret queen of Scotland by the earl of Angus, whom that
princess married after the death of James IV.&mdash;Darnley, who had
been born and educated in England, was but in his 21st year, when
he was murdered, Feb. 9, 1567-8. This crime was perpetrated by
the E. of Bothwell, not out of respect to the memory of Riccio,
but in order to pave the way for his own marriage with the queen.

This ballad (printed, with a few corrections, from the Editor's
folio MS.) seems to have been written soon after Mary's escape
into England in 1568, see v. 65.&mdash;It will be remembered at v. 5,
that this princess was Q. dowager of France, having been first
married to Francis II. who died Dec. 4, 1560.

[Pg 216]





[In the above note Percy takes the ordinary unfavourable view
of Darnley's character, which is not entirely borne out by contemporary
evidence. Darnley was unfortunate both in having all
Mary's friends as his enemies and in having no supporters among
her opponents because he was a Roman Catholic. It is not fair to
dispose of such a ballad as the present with the inference that the
writer could know nothing of Darnley's character. It does not
stand alone, and it appears from the broadsides that circulated
through the country after his murder that the people had a real
liking for him although he had been amongst them only a couple
of years. Robert Lekprevik, the most celebrated Edinburgh
printer of his time, printed in 1567, The Testament and Tragedie
of umquhile King Henrie Stewart of gude memorie, a powerful poem,
which discovers clearly the popular feeling against Mary. Mr.
Froude also found one of these ballads among the Scottish State
Papers, in which curses are heaped upon Mary, who is called
Dalila, Clytemnestra and Semiramis for her murder of "ane
bonny boy." One of the verses is as follows:&mdash;


"At ten houris on Sunday late at een,
When Dalila and Bothwell bade good night,
Off her finger false she threw ane ring,
And said, My Lord ane token you I plight."


If the circumstances of the English ballad are related in a partial
and imperfect manner, what shall we say of the much more severe
tone of those written in Scotland. Mr. Maidment[607] has gathered
together a few facts that show how much may be said in favour of
the unfortunate prince. It appears from Colville's Historie and Life
of King James the sext, that Secretary Maitland inflamed Darnley's
mind with the insinuation that Rizzio was too intimate with the
queen. The criminal familiarity of her majesty with Rizzio
appears to have been generally suspected, so that Darnley's
conduct was that of a jealous husband who was fascinated with
his wife. Colville gives the following portrait of him:&mdash;"He was
a cumlie Prince, of a fayre and large stature of bodie, pleasant in
countenance and affable to all men and devote, weill excercesit in
martiall pastymis uponn horsback as ony prince of that age, bot was
sa facile as he could concele no secreit although it myght tend to
his awin weill."[608]

He was certainly accomplished and had been carefully educated.
[Pg 217]He wrote a little tale called Utopia Nova when he was between
eight and nine years of age, which he presented to his cousin,
Mary Tudor. The queen in return presented him with a gold
chain, which he acknowledged in a letter remarkable for the
extreme beauty of its caligraphy. He also completed a translation
into English of Valerius Maximus. Mr. Froude severely
condemns the character of Darnley in the following terms: "He
was at once meddlesome and incapable, weak and cowardly, yet
insolent and unmanageable," and adds that Randolph described
him as "a conceited, arrogant, intolerant fool." Nevertheless "the
death of the husband of the Queen of Scots belongs to that rare
class of incidents which, like the murder of C&aelig;sar, have touched
the interests of the entire educated world. Perhaps there is no
single recorded act, arising merely out of private or personal passions,
of which the public consequences have been so considerable."[609]

Darnley was the second son of the Earl and Countess of Lennox,
and not, as stated above, by Percy, the eldest. Their first-born
died on the 28th of November, 1545, nine months after his birth.

The following ballad is entitled Earle Bodwell in the Folio MS.
(ed. Hales and Furnivall, vol. ii. p. 260). In the first three editions
of the Reliques there were more alterations from the MS. than
in the fourth, for in the latter Percy restored several of the old
readings. The retained alterations are judicious, and no more than
the Editor might well feel himself justified in making.]




  



Woe worth, woe worth thee, false Scotl&agrave;nde![610]
For thou hast ever wrought by sleight;[611]
The worthyest prince that ever was borne,[612]
You hanged under a cloud by night.

The queene of France a letter wrote,                                 5
And sealed itt with harte and ringe;
And bade him come Scotland within,
And shee wold marry and crowne him kinge.[613]
[Pg 218]
To be a king is a pleasant thing,[614]
To bee a prince unto a peere:                                     10
But you have heard, and soe have I too,
A man may well buy gold too deare.

There was an Italyan in that place,
Was as well beloved as ever was hee,
Lord David was his name,[615]                                       15
Chamberlaine to the queene was hee.[616]

If the king had risen forth of his place,[617]
He wold have sate him downe in the cheare,[618]
And tho itt beseemed him not so well,
Altho the kinge had beene present there.                          20

Some lords in Scotlande waxed wroth,[619]
And quarrelled with him for the nonce;
I shall you tell how it befell,
Twelve daggers were in him att once.[620]

When the queene saw her chamberlaine was slaine,[621]               25
For him her faire cheeks shee did weete,[622]
And made a vowe for a yeare and a day[623]
The king and shee wold not come in one sheete.

Then some of the lords they waxed wrothe,[624]
And made their vow all vehementlye;                               30
For the death of the queenes chamberlaine,
The king himselfe, how he shall dye.[625]

With gun-powder they strewed his roome,[626]
And layd greene rushes in his way;
For the traitors thought that very night[627]                       35
This worthye king for to betray.[628]
[Pg 219]
To bedd the king he made him bowne;[629][630]
To take his rest was his desire;[631]
He was noe sooner cast on sleepe,
But his chamber was on a biasing fire.                            40

Up he lope,[632] and the window brake;[633]
And hee had thirtye foote to fall:[634]
Lord Bodwell kept a privy watch,
Underneath his castle wall.

Who have wee here? lord Bodwell sayd:[635]                          45
Now answer me, that I may know.[636]
"King Henry the eighth my uncle was;
For his sweete sake some pitty show."[637]

Who have we here? lord Bodwell sayd,[638]
Now answer me when I doe speake.[638]                           50
"Ah, lord Bodwell, I know thee well;
Some pitty on me I pray thee take."

Ile pitty thee as much, he sayd,
And as much favor show to thee,[639]
As thou didst to the queenes chamberlaine,[640]                     55
That day thou deemedst[641] him to die.[642]

Through halls and towers the king they ledd,[643]
Through towers and castles that were nye,[644]
Through an arbor into an orch&agrave;rd,
There on a peare-tree hanged him hye.[645]                        60
[Pg 220]
When the governor of Scotland heard[646]
How that the worthye king was slaine;[647]
He persued the queen so bitterlye,
That in Scotland shee dare not remaine.[648]

But she is fledd into merry England,                                65
And here her residence hath taine;[649]
And through the queene of Englands grace,[650]
In England now shee doth remaine.[651]

XV.

A SONNET BY Q. ELIZABETH.



  

The following lines, if they display no rich vein of poetry,
are yet so strongly characteristic of their great and
spirited authoress, that the insertion of them will be
pardoned. They are preserved in Puttenham's Arte
of English Poesie; a book in which are many sly addresses to the
queen's foible of shining as a poetess. The extraordinary manner
in which these verses are introduced shews what kind of homage
was exacted from the courtly writers of that age, viz.

"I find," says this antiquated critic, "none example in English
metre, so well maintaining this figure [Exargasia, or the Gorgeous,
Lat. Expolitio] as that dittie of her majesties owne making, passing
sweete and harmonicall; which figure beyng as his very originall
name purporteth the most bewtifull and gorgious of all others, it
asketh in reason to be reserved for a last complement, and desciphred
by a ladies penne herselfe beyng the most bewtifull, or
rather bewt&igrave;e of queenes.[652] And this was the occasion: our soveraigne
lady perceiving how the Scottish queenes residence within
this realme at so great libertie and ease (as were skarce meete for
so great and dangerous a prysoner) bred secret factions among her
people, and made many of the nobilitie incline to favour her partie:
some of them desirous of innovation in the state: others aspiring
[Pg 221]to greater fortunes by her libertie and life. The queene our soveraigne
ladie to declare that she was nothing ignorant of those secret
practizes, though she had long with great wisdome and pacience
dissembled it, writeth this dittie most sweete and sententious, not
hiding from all such aspiring minds the daunger of their ambition
and disloyaltie: which afterward fell out most truly by th' exemplary
chastisement of sundry persons, who in fauour of the said Sc.
Q. declining from her Maiestie, sought to interrupt the quiet of the
Realme by many euill and vndutiful practizes." (p. 207.)

This sonnet was probably written in 1584, not long before Hen.
Percy 8th E. of Northumberland was imprisoned on suspicion of
plotting with F. Throckmorton, Tho. Lord Paget, and the Guises,
for invading England, and liberating the Q. of Scots, &amp;c. (See
Collins's Peerage, 1779, ii. 405.) The original is written in long
lines or alexandrines, each of which is here, on account of the
narrowness of the page, subdivided into two: but her majesty's
orthography, or at least that of her copyist, is exactly followed.

In the first edition of Harrington's Nug&aelig; Antiqu&aelig;, 1st vol. 1769,
12mo. p. 58, is a copy of this poem, with great variations, the best
of which are noted below. It is there accompanied with a very
curious letter, in which this sonnet is said to be "of her Highness
own enditing ... My Lady Willoughby did covertly get it on her
Majesties tablet, and had much hazard in so doing; for the Queen
did find out the thief, and chid for spreading evil bruit of her
writing such toyes, when other matters did so occupy her employment
at this time; and was fearful of being thought too lightly of
for so doing." ***




  



The doubt of future foes,[653]
Exiles my present ioy,
And wit me warnes to shun such snares
As threaten mine annoy.

For falshood now doth flow,                                          5
And subiect faith doth ebbe,[654]
Which would not be, if reason rul'd[655]
Or wisdome weu'd the webbe.[656]

But clowdes of iois vntried,[657]
Do cloake aspiring mindes,                                        10
Which turne to raine of late repent,[658][Pg 222]
By course of changed windes.

The toppe of hope supposed,
The roote of ruthe wil be,
And frutelesse all their graffed guiles,                            15
As shortly ye shall see.

Then dazeld eyes with pride,
Which great ambition blinds,
Shalbe vnseeld by worthy wights,
Whose foresight falshood finds.                                   20

The daughter of debate,[659]
That eke discord doth sowe,[660]
Shal reap no gaine where former rule[661]
Hath taught stil peace to growe.

No forreine bannisht wight                                          25
Shall ancre in this port,
Our realme it brookes no strangers force,[662]
Let them elsewhere resort.

Our rusty sworde with rest,
Shall first his edge employ,                                      30
To polle their toppes, that seeke such change
And gape for 'such like' ioy.[663]






&dagger;&Dagger;&dagger; I cannot help subjoining to the above sonnet another distich
of Elizabeth's preserved by Puttenham (p. 197) "which (says
he) our soveraigne lady wrote in defiance of fortune."


"Never thinke you, Fortune can beare the sway,
Where Vertue's force can cause her to obay."




The slightest effusion of such a mind deserves attention.

XVI.

KING OF SCOTS AND ANDREW
BROWNE.



  

This ballad is a proof of the little intercourse that subsisted
between the Scots and English, before the accession of
James I. to the crown of England. The tale which is
here so circumstantially related does not appear to have
had the least foundation in history, but was probably built upon
some confused hearsay report of the tumults in Scotland during the
minority of that prince, and of the conspiracies formed by different
factions to get possession of his person. It should seem
from ver. 97 to have been written during the regency, or at least
before the death, of the earl of Morton, who was condemned and
executed June 2, 1581; when James was in his 15th year.

The original copy (preserved in the archives of the Antiquarian
Society, London) is intitled, A new Ballad, declaring the great
treason conspired against the young king of Scots, and how one Andrew
Browne an Englishman, which was the king's chamberlaine,
prevented the same. To the tune of Milfield, or els to Green-sleeves.
At the end is subjoined the name of the author "W. Elderton.
Imprinted at London for Yarathe James, dwelling in Newgate
Market, over against Ch. Church," in black-letter, folio.

This Elderton, who had been originally an attorney in the
sheriffs' courts of London, and afterwards (if we may believe
Oldys) a comedian, was a facetious fuddling companion, whose
tippling and rhymes rendered him famous among his contemporaries.
He was author of many popular songs and ballads:
and probably other pieces in these volumes, besides the following,
are of his composing. He is believed to have fallen a victim to
his bottle before the year 1592. His epitaph has been recorded
by Camden, and translated by Oldys:&mdash;


"Hic situs est sitiens, atque ebrius Eldertonus,
Quid dico hic situs est? hic potius sitis est,"

"Dead drunk here Elderton doth lie;
Dead as he is, he still is dry:
So of him it may well be said,
Here he, but not his thirst, is laid."


See Stow's Lond. [Guild Hall].&mdash;Biog. Brit. [Drayton, by Oldys[Pg 224]
Note B.] Ath. Ox.&mdash;Camden's Remains.&mdash;The Exale-tation of Ale,
among Beaumont's Poems, 8vo. 1653.





[This ballad was licensed to Y. James on the 30th of May, 1581.
Percy does not mention in the above note the fact that the ballad
is included in the Folio MS., where it is entitled Bishoppe and
Browne (ed. Hales and Furnivall, vol. ii. p. 265). It only consists
of ten stanzas in place of fifteen, and two of them are incomplete.
There is a sort of second part, probably also by Elderton, called
King James and Brown, in the MS. (vol. i. p. 135), the villain of
which is the same Douglas who is warned in the 98th verse of the
present ballad to "take heede you do not offend the king."]




  



Out alas!' what a griefe is this
That princes subjects cannot be true,
But still the devill hath some of his,
Will play their parts whatsoever ensue;
Forgetting what a grievous thing                                     5
It is to offend the anointed king?
Alas for woe, why should it be so,
This makes a sorrowful heigh ho.

In Scotland is a bonnie kinge,
As proper a youth as neede to be,                                 10
Well given to every happy thing,
That can be in a kinge to see:
Yet that unluckie country still,
Hath people given to craftie will.
Alas for woe, &amp;c.                                             15

On Whitsun eve it so befell,
A posset was made to give the king,
Whereof his ladie nurse hard tell,
And that it was a poysoned thing:
She cryed, and called piteouslie;                                   20
Now help, or els the king shall die!
Alas for woe, &amp;c.[Pg 225]

One Browne, that was an English man,
And hard the ladies piteous crye,
Out with his sword, and bestir'd him than,                          25
Out of the doores in haste to flie;
But all the doores were made so fast,
Out of a window he got at last
Alas for woe, &amp;c.

He met the bishop coming fast,                                      30
Having the posset in his hande:
The sight of Browne made him aghast,
Who bad him stoutly staie and stand.
With him were two that ranne awa,
For feare that Browne would make a fray.                            35
Alas for woe, &amp;c.

Bishop, quoth Browne, what hast thou there?
Nothing at all, my friend, sayde he;
But a posset to make the king good cheere.
Is it so? sayd Browne, that will I see,                           40
First I will have thyself begin,
Before thou go any further in;
Be it weale or woe, it shall be so,
This makes a sorrowful heigh ho.

The bishop sayde, Browne I doo know,                                45
Thou art a young man poore and bare;
Livings on thee I will bestowe:
Let me go on, take thou no care.
No, no, quoth Browne, I will not be
A traitour for all Christiantie:                                    50
Happe well or woe, it shall be so,
Drink now with a sorrowfull, &amp;c.

The bishop dranke, and by and by
His belly burst and he fell downe:
A just rewarde for his traitery.                                    55
This was a posset indeed, quoth Brown![Pg 226]
He serched the bishop, and found the keyes,
To come to the kinge when he did please.
Alas for woe, &amp;c.

As soon as the king got word of this,                               60
He humbly fell uppon his knee,
And praysed God that he did misse
To tast of that extremity:
For that he did perceive and know,
His clergie would betray him so:                                    65
Alas for woe, &amp;c.

Alas, he said, unhappie realme,[664]
My father, and grandfather slaine:
My mother banished, O extreame!
Unhappy fate, and bitter bayne!                                   70
And now like treason wrought for me,
What more unhappie realme can be!
Alas for woe, &amp;c.

The king did call his nurse to his grace,
And gave her twenty poundes a yeere;                              75
And trustie Browne too in like case,
He knighted him with gallant geere;
And gave him 'lands and' livings great,
For dooing such a manly feat,
As he did showe, to the bishop's woe,                         80
Which made, &amp;c.

When all this treason done and past,
Tooke not effect of traytery;
Another treason at the last,
They sought against his majestie:                                 85
How they might make their kinge away,[Pg 227]
By a privie banket[665] on a daye.
Alas for woe, &amp;c.

'Another time' to sell the king
Beyonde the seas they had decreede:                               90
Three noble Earles heard of this thing.
And did prevent the same with speede.
For a letter came, with such a charme,
That they should doo their king no harme:
For further woe, if they did soe,                             95
Would make a sorrowful heigh hoe.

The Earle Mourton told the Douglas then,
Take heede you do not offend the king;
But shew yourselves like honest men
Obediently in every thing:                                       100
For his godmother[666] will not see
Her noble childe misus'd to be
With any woe; for if it be so,
She will make, &amp;c.

God graunt all subjects may be true,                               105
In England, Scotland, every where:
That no such daunger may ensue,
To put the prince or state in feare:
That God the highest king may see
Obedience as it ought to be,                                       110
In wealth or woe, God graunt it be so
To avoide the sorrowful heigh ho.

XVII.

THE BONNY EARL OF MURRAY.


A Scottish Song.



  

In December, 1591, Francis Stewart, Earl of Bothwell,
had made an attempt to seize on the person of his
sovereign James VI., but being disappointed, had retired
towards the north. The king unadvisedly gave a commission
to George Gordon Earl of Huntley, to pursue Bothwell
and his followers with fire and sword. Huntley, under cover of
executing that commission, took occasion to revenge a private
quarrel he had against James Stewart Earl of Murray, a relation
of Bothwell's. In the night of Feb. 7, 1592, he beset Murray's
house, burnt it to the ground, and slew Murray himself; a young
nobleman of the most promising virtues, and the very darling of
the people. See Robertson's Hist.

The present Lord Murray hath now in his possession a picture
of his ancestor naked and covered with wounds, which had been
carried about, according to the custom of that age, in order to
inflame the populace to revenge his death. If this picture did not
flatter, he well deserved the name of the bonny Earl, for he is there
represented as a tall and comely personage. It is a tradition in
the family, that Gordon of Bucky gave him a wound in the face:
Murray half expiring, said, "You hae spilt a better face than your
awin." Upon this, Bucky pointing his dagger at Huntley's breast,
swore, "You shall be as deep as I;" and forced him to pierce the
poor defenceless body.

K. James, who took no care to punish the murtherers, is said by
some to have privately countenanced and abetted them, being
stimulated by jealousy for some indiscreet praises which his Queen
had too lavishly bestowed on this unfortunate youth. See the
preface to the next ballad. See also Mr. Walpole's Catalogue of
Royal Auth. vol. i. p. 42.





[James Stewart, son of Sir James Stewart of Doune, acquired
the earldom of Murray by his marriage with Elizabeth, eldest
daughter and heiress of the Regent Murray. The earl was only
twenty-one years of age at the time of his murder, which was
perpetrated at Dinnibrissel, the seat of his mother, where he was
on a visit. Doune Castle in Menteith is now in ruins, but it is[Pg 229]
still the property of the family, and gives the title of Viscount to
the eldest son of the Earl of Murray. The Earl of Huntley,
instead of being punished for his crime, was created a marquis,
and King James made the young earl of Murray marry the eldest
daughter of his father's murderer.

There is another version of this ballad given in Finlay's Scottish
Ballads (ii. 21), which commences&mdash;


"Open the gates
And let him come in;
He is my brother Huntly,
He'll do me nae harm."




The author of this seems to have supposed that Murray married a
sister of Huntley.]




  



Ye highlands, and ye lawlands,
Oh! quhair hae ye been?
They hae slaine the Earl of Murray,
And hae laid him on the green.

Now wae be to thee, Huntley!                                         5
And quhairfore did you sae!
I bade you bring him wi' you,
But forbade you him to slay.

He was a braw gallant,
And he rid at the ring;                                           10
And the bonny Earl of Murray,
Oh! he might hae been a king.

He was a braw gallant,
And he playd at the ba';
And the bonny Earl of Murray                                        15
Was the flower among them a'.

He was a braw gallant,
And he playd at the gluve;
And the bonny Earl of Murray,
Oh! he was the Queenes luve.                                      20[Pg 230]

Oh! lang will his lady
Luke owre the castle downe,[667]
Ere she see the Earl of Murray
Cum sounding throw the towne.


FOOTNOTES:



[667] Castle downe here has been thought to mean the Castle of
Downe, a seat belonging to the family of Murray.

YOUNG WATERS.


A Scottish Ballad.



  

It has been suggested to the Editor, that this ballad
covertly alludes to the indiscreet partiality, which
Q. Anne of Denmark is said to have shewn for the
bonny Earl of Murray; and which is supposed to have
influenced the fate of that unhappy nobleman. Let the reader
judge for himself.

The following account of the murder is given by a contemporary
writer, and a person of credit, Sir James Balfour, knight, Lyon
King of Arms, whose MS. of the Annals of Scotland is in the
Advocates library at Edinburgh.

"The seventh of Febry, this yeire, 1592, the Earle of Murray
was cruelly murthered by the Earle of Huntley at his house in
Dunibrissel in Fyffe-shyre, and with him Dumbar, shriffe of Murray.
It [was] given out and publickly talked, that the Earle
of Huntley was only the instrument of perpetrating this facte,
to satisfie the King's jealousie of Murray, quhum the Queine
more rashely than wyslie, some few dayes before had commendit
in the King's heiringe, with too many epithets of a proper and
gallant man. The reasons of these surmises proceidit from proclamatione
of the Kings, the 18 of Marche following; inhibiting
the younge Earle of Murray to persue the Earle of Huntley, for his
father's slaughter, in respect he being wardit [imprisoned] in the
castell of Blacknesse for the same murther, was willing to abide
his tryall, averring that he had done nothing bot by the King's
[Pg 231]majesties commissione; and was neither airt nor part of the
murther."[668]

The following ballad is here given from a copy printed not long
since at Glasgow, in one sheet 8vo. The world was indebted for
its publication to the lady Jean Hume, sister to the Earl of Hume,
who died at Gibraltar [in 1761].





[Buchan, who printed a longer version of this ballad in thirty-nine
stanzas, believed young Waters to have been David Graham
of Fintray, who was found guilty of being concerned in a Popish
plot, and beheaded on the 16th of February, 1592. Chambers
supposed that the fate of some one of the Scottish nobles executed
by James I. after his return from captivity in England is alluded to.
The various conflicting conjectures are none of them very probable,
and there is nothing in the ballad that would conclusively connect
it with authentic Scottish history. Percy's suggestion is peculiarly
unfortunate, as young Waters was publicly executed at Stirling.
Mr. Maidment points out (Scottish Ballads and Songs, vol. i. p. 62)
that the first edition appeared under the following title, Young
Waters, an Ancient Scotish Poem, never before printed. Glasgow:
printed and sold by Robert and Andrew Foulis, MDCCLV. sm. 4to.
pp. 8; and he suggests that Lord Hailes was the editor of it.]




  



About Yule, quhen the wind blew cule,
And the round tables began,
A'! there is cum to our kings court
Mony a well-favourd man.

The queen luikt owre the castle wa,                                  5
Beheld baith dale and down,
And then she saw young Waters
Cum riding to the town.

His footmen they did rin before,
His horsemen rade behind,                                         10
Ane mantel of the burning gowd
Did keip him frae the wind.
[Pg 232]
Gowden graith'd[669] his horse before
And siller shod behind,
The horse yong Waters rade upon                                     15
Was fleeter than the wind.

But then spake a wylie lord,
Unto the queen said he,
O tell me quha's the fairest face
Rides in the company.                                             20

I've sene lord, and I've sene laird,
And knights of high degree;
Bot a fairer face than young Wat&egrave;rs
Mine eyne did never see.

Out then spack the jealous king,                                    25
(And an angry man was he)
O, if he had been twice as fair,
You micht have excepted me.

You're neither laird nor lord, she says,
Bot the king that wears the crown;                                30
Ther is not a knight in fair Scotland
Bot to thee maun bow down.

For a' that she could do or say,
Appeasd he wad nae bee;
Bot for the words which she had said                                35
Young Waters he maun dee.

They hae taen young Waters, and
Put fetters to his feet;
They hae taen young Waters, and
Thrown him in dungeon deep.                                       40
[Pg 233]
Aft I have ridden thro' Stirling town
In the wind both and the weit;
Bot I neir rade thro' Stirling town
Wi fetters at my feet.

Aft have I ridden thro' Stirling town                               45
In the wind both and the rain;
Bot I neir rade thro' Stirling town
Neir to return again.

They hae taen to the heiding-hill[670]
His young son in his craddle,                                     50
And they hae taen to the heiding-hill,
His horse both and his saddle.

They hae taen to the heiding-hill
His lady fair to see.
And for the words the Queen had spoke,                              55
Young Waters he did dee.

MARY AMBREE.



  

In the year 1584, the Spaniards, under the command of
Alexander Farnese, prince of Parma, began to gain
great advantages in Flanders and Brabant, by recovering
many strong holds and cities from the Hollanders,
as Ghent, (called then by the English Gaunt,) Antwerp,
Mechlin, &amp;c. See Stow's Annals, p. 711. Some attempt made
with the assistance of English volunteers to retrieve the former of
those places probably gave occasion to this ballad. I can find no
mention of our heroine in history, but the following rhymes rendered
her famous among our poets. Ben Jonson often mentions her,
[Pg 234]and calls any remarkable virago by her name. See his Epic&oelig;ne,
first acted in 1609, act iv. sc. 2. His Tale of a Tub, act i. sc. 2.
And his masque intitled the Fortunate Isles, 1626, where he quotes
the very words of the ballad,


----"Mary Ambree,
(Who marched so free
To the siege of Gaunt,
And death could not daunt,
As the ballad doth vaunt)
Were a braver wight, &amp;c."


She is also mentioned in Fletcher's Scornful Lady, act v. sub
finem.

----"My large gentlewoman, my Mary Ambree, had I but
seen into you, you should have had another bed-fellow."&mdash;&mdash;

It is likewise evident, that she is the virago intended by Butler
in Hudibras (p. i. c. iii. v. 365), by her being coupled with Joan
d'Arc, the celebrated Pucelle d'Orleans.


"A bold virago stout and tall
As Joan of France, or English Mall."


This ballad is printed from a black letter copy in the Pepys
Collection, improved from the Editor's folio MS. and by conjecture.
The full title is, The valorous acts performed at Gaunt by the brave
bonnie lass Mary Ambree, who in revenge of her lovers death did play
her part most gallantly. The tune is, The blind beggar, &amp;c.





[The copy from the MS., which is printed at the end, will be
found to differ considerably from the following version.]




  



When captain's couragious, whom death cold not daunte,
Did march to the siege of the citty of Gaunt,
They mustred their souldiers by two and by three,
And the formost in battle was Mary Ambree.

When brave Sir John Major[671] was slaine in her sight,              5
Who was her true lover, her joy, and delight,
Because he was slaine most treacherouslie,[Pg 235]
Then vowd to revenge him Mary Ambree.

She clothed herselfe from the top to the toe
In buffe of the bravest, most seemelye to showe;                    10
A faire shirt of male[672] then slipped on shee;
Was not this a brave bonny lass, Mary Ambree?

A helmett of proofe shee strait did provide,
A strong arminge sword shee girt by her side,
On her hand a goodly faire gauntlett put shee;                      15
Was not this a brave bonny lass, Mary Ambree?

Then tooke shee her sworde and her targett in hand,
Bidding all such, as wold, bee of her band;
To wayte on her person came thousand and three:
Was not this a brave bonny lass, Mary Ambree?                       20

My soldiers, she saith, soe valiant and bold,
Nowe followe your captaine, whom you doe beholde;
Still foremost in battel myselfe will I bee:
Was not this a brave bonny lasse, Mary Ambree?

Then cryed out her souldiers, and loude they did say,               25
Soe well thou becomest this gallant array,
Thy harte and thy weapons soe well do agree,
There was none ever like Mary Ambree.

Shee cheared her souldiers, that foughten for life,
With ancyent and standard, with drum and with fyfe,                 30
With brave clanging trumpetts, that sounded so free;
Was not this a brave bonny lasse, Mary Ambree?

Before I will see the worst of you all
To come into danger of death, or of thrall,
This hand and this life I will venture so free:                     35
Was not this a brave bonny lasse, Mary Ambree?
[Pg 236]
Shee led upp her souldiers in battaile array,
Gainst three times theyr number by breake of the daye;
Seven howers in skirmish continued shee:
Was not this a brave bonny lasse, Mary Ambree?                      40

She filled the skyes with the smoke of her shott,
And her enemyes bodyes with bullets soe hott;
For one of her owne men a score killed shee:
Was not this a brave bonny lasse, Mary Ambree?

And when her false gunner, to spoyle her intent,                    45
Away all her pellets and powder had sent,
Straight with her keen weapon shee slasht him in three:
Was not this a brave bonny lasse, Mary Ambree?

Being falselye betrayed for lucre of hyre,
At length she was forced to make a retyre;                          50
Then her souldiers into a strong castle drew shee:
Was not this a brave bonny lasse, Mary Ambree?

Her foes they besett her on everye side,
As thinking close siege shee cold never abide;
To beate down the walles they all did decree:                       55
But stoutlye deffyd them brave Mary Ambree.

Then tooke shee her sword and her targett in hand,
And mounting the walls all undaunted did stand,
There daring their captaines to match any three:
O what a brave captaine was Mary Ambree!                            60

Now saye, English captaine, what woldest thou give
To ransome thy selfe, which else must not live?
Come yield thy selfe quicklye, or slaine thou must bee.
Then smiled sweetlye brave Mary Ambree.

Ye captaines couragious, of valour so bold,                         65
Whom thinke you before you now you doe behold?
A knight, sir, of England, and captaine soe free,
Who shortelye with us a prisoner must bee.[Pg 237]

No captaine of England; behold in your sight
Two brests in my bosome, and therfore no knight:                    70
Noe knight, sirs, of England, nor captaine you see,
But a poor simple lass, called Mary Ambree.

But art thou a woman, as thou dost declare,
Whose valor hath provd so undaunted in warre?
If England doth yield such brave lasses as thee,                    75
Full well may they conquer, faire Mary Ambree.

The prince of Great Parma heard of her renowne,
Who long had advanced for Englands faire crowne;
Hee wooed her and sued her his mistress to bee,
And offerd rich presents to Mary Ambree.                            80

But this virtuous mayden despised them all,
Ile nere sell my honour for purple nor pall:
A mayden of England, sir, never will bee
The whore of a monarcke, quoth Mary Ambree.

Then to her owne country shee backe did returne,                    85
Still holding the foes of faire England in scorne:
Therfore English captaines of every degree
Sing forth the brave valours of Mary Ambree.

The death of her trueloue shee meant to requite
with fire &amp; ffamine [&amp;] sword shining bright,
which lately was slaine most villanouslye;

Shee cladd her selfe from the top to the toe

Shee tooke her sword &amp; her targett in hand,

to waite on her person there came 1000ds 3:
was not this a braue, bonye lasse, Mary Aumbree?                    24

"My soldiers," shee saith, "soe valiant and bold,
now ffollow your Captain which you doe beholde;
in the fight formost my selfe will I bee!"
was not this a braue, bonye lasse, Mary Aumbree?                    28

Then cryed out her souldiers, &amp; loude th&eacute; did say,

BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBEY.



  

Peregrine Bertie, lord Willoughby of Eresby, had,
in the year 1586, distinguished himself at the siege of
Zutphen, in the Low Countries. He was the year after
made general of the English forces in the United Provinces,
in room of the earl of Leicester, who was recalled. This
gave him an opportunity of signalizing his courage and military
skill in several actions against the Spaniards. One of these,
greatly exaggerated by popular report, is probably the subject of
this old ballad, which, on account of its flattering encomiums on
English valour, hath always been a favourite with the people.

"My lord Willoughbie (says a contemporary writer) was one of
the queenes best swordsmen: ... he was a great master of the art
military ... I have heard it spoken, that had he not slighted the
court, but applied himself to the queene, he might have enjoyed a
plentifull portion of her grace; and it was his saying, and it did
him no good, that he was none of the Reptilia; intimating, that
he could not creepe on the ground, and that the court was not
his element; for indeed, as he was a great souldier, so he was of
suitable magnanimitie, and could not brooke the obsequiousnesse
and assiduitie of the courte." (Naunton.)

Lord Willoughbie died in 1601.&mdash;Both Norris and Turner were
famous among the military men of that age.

The subject of this ballad (which is printed from an old black-letter
copy, with some conjectural emendations,) may possibly
receive illustration from what Chapman says in the Dedicat. to his
version of Homer's Frogs and Mice, concerning the brave and
memorable Retreat of Sir John Norris, with only 1000 men, thro'
the whole Spanish army, under the duke of Parma, for three miles
together.





[Lord Willoughby was the son of Katherine, daughter of Lord
Willoughby of Eresby and widow of Charles Brandon, Duke of
Suffolk, and of her second husband, Richard Bertie. They were
protestants and were forced to fly from persecution in 1553, taking
refuge first in the Low Countries and afterwards in Poland. They
called their son in consequence Peregrine, a name that has ever
since remained in the family. Mr. Hales has drawn my attention
to the fact that Spenser, when in Ireland, named one of his sons
Peregrine for a similar reason. A ballad was written entitled The
Duchess of Suffolk's Calamity, which contains these lines:

[Pg 241]


"A sonne she had in Germanie,
Peregrine Bartue cald by name,
Surnamde The Good Lord Willobie,
Of courage great and worthie fame."




Mr. Chappell informs us that the tune of the following ballad
occurs in Lady Neville's Virginal Book (MS. 1591), and in Robinson's
School of Music (1603), where it is called "Lord Willobie's
Welcome Home."]




  



The fifteenth day of July,
With glistering spear and shield,
A famous fight in Flanders
Was foughten in the field:
The most couragious officers                                         5
Were English captains three;
But the bravest man in battel
Was brave lord Willoughb&egrave;y.

The next was captain Norris,
A valiant man was hee:                                            10
The other captain Turner,
From field would never flee.
With fifteen hundred fighting men,
Alas! there were no more,
They fought with fourteen thousand then,                            15
Upon the bloody shore.

Stand to it noble pikemen,
And look you round about:
And shoot you right you bow-men,
And we will keep them out:                                        20
You musquet and calliver[673] men,
Do you prove true to me,
I'le be the formost man in fight,
Says brave lord Willoughb&egrave;y.
[Pg 242]
And then the bloody enemy                                           25
They fiercely did assail,
And fought it out most furiously,
Not doubting to prevail;
The wounded men on both sides fell
Most pitious for to see,                                          30
Yet nothing could the courage quell
Of brave lord Willoughb&egrave;y.

For seven hours to all mens view
This fight endured sore,
Until our men so feeble grew                                        35
That they could fight no more;
And then upon dead horses
Full savourly they eat,
And drank the puddle water,
They could no better get.                                         40

When they had fed so freely,
They kneeled on the ground,
And praised God devoutly
For the favour they had found;
And beating up their colours,                                       45
The fight they did renew,
And turning tow'rds the Spaniard,
A thousand more they slew.

The sharp steel-pointed arrows,
And bullets thick did fly;                                        50
Then did our valiant soldiers
Charge on most furiously;
Which made the Spaniards waver,
They thought it best to flee,
They fear'd the stout behaviour                                     55
Of brave lord Willoughb&egrave;y.

Then quoth the Spanish general,
Come let us march away,
I fear we shall be spoiled all
If here we longer stay;                                           60[Pg 243]
For yonder comes lord Willoughbey
With courage fierce and fell,
He will not give one inch of way
For all the devils in hell.

And then the fearful enemy                                          65
Was quickly put to flight,
Our men persued couragiously,
And caught their forces quite;
But at last they gave a shout,
Which ecchoed through the sky,                                    70
God, and St. George for England!
The conquerers did cry.

This news was brought to England
With all the speed might be,
And soon our gracious queen was told                                75
Of this same victory.
O this is brave lord Willoughbey,
My love that ever won,
Of all the lords of honour
'Tis he great deeds hath done.                                    80

To the souldiers that were maimed,
And wounded in the fray,
The queen allowed a pension
Of fifteen pence a day;
And from all costs and charges                                      85
She quit and set them free:
And this she did all for the sake
Of brave lord Willoughb&egrave;y.

Then courage, noble Englishmen,
And never be dismaid;                                             90
If that we be but one to ten,
We will not be afraid
To fight with foraign enemies,
And set our nation free.
And thus I end the bloody bout                                      95
Of brave lord Willoughb&egrave;y.

VICTORIOUS MEN OF EARTH.



  

This little moral sonnet hath such a pointed application
to the heroes of the foregoing and following ballads,
that I cannot help placing it here, tho' the date of its
composition is of a much later period. It is extracted
from Cupid and Death, a masque by J. S. (James Shirley) presented
Mar. 26, 1653. London printed 1653, 4to.





[Dr. Rimbault informs us that this masque was represented at
the Military Ground in Leicester Fields, with music by Matthew
Locke and Dr. Christopher Gibbons. (Musical Illustrations,
p. 22.)]




  



Victorious men of earth, no more
Proclaim how wide your empires are;
Though you binde in every shore,
And your triumphs reach as far
As night or day;                               5
Yet you proud monarchs must obey,
And mingle with forgotten ashes, when
Death calls yee to the croud of common men.

Devouring famine, plague, and war,
Each able to undo mankind,                                        10
Death's servile emissaries are;
Nor to these alone confin'd,
He hath at will
More quaint and subtle wayes to kill;
A smile or kiss, as he will use the art,                            15
Shall have the cunning skill to break a heart.

[Pg 245]




XXII.

THE WINNING OF CALES.



  

The subject of this ballad is the taking of the city of
Cadiz, (called by our sailors corruptly Cales) on June
21, 1596, in a descent made on the coast of Spain,
under the command of the Lord Howard admiral, and
the earl of Essex general.

The valour of Essex was not more distinguished on this occasion
than his generosity: the town was carried sword in hand, but
he stopt the slaughter as soon as possible, and treated his prisoners
with the greatest humanity, and even affability and kindness. The
English made a rich plunder in the city, but missed of a much
richer, by the resolution which the Duke of Medina, the Spanish
admiral, took, of setting fire to the ships, in order to prevent their
falling into the hands of the enemy [see v. 27]. It was computed,
that the loss which the Spaniards sustained from this enterprize,
amounted to twenty millions of ducats. See Hume's Hist.

The Earl of Essex knighted on this occasion not fewer than
sixty persons, which gave rise to the following sarcasm:


"A gentleman of Wales, a knight of Cales,
And a laird of the North country;
But a yeoman of Kent with his yearly rent
Will buy them out all three."


The ballad is printed, with some corrections, from the Editor's
folio MS. and seems to have been composed by some person, who
was concerned in the expedition. Most of the circumstances
related in it will be found supported by history.





[Philip II. was meditating the dispatch of a second armada,
but before he could set his schemes in motion his strongest fortress
was razed to the ground. Macaulay calls this "the most brilliant
military exploit that was achieved on the continent by English
arms during the long interval which elapsed between the battle of
Agincourt and that of Blenheim." No wonder then that the English
sang with enthusiasm of the glories of their success. Raleigh
and Sir Francis Vere were among the leaders under Essex.

It will be seen by the foot notes that Percy follows his MS.
original pretty faithfully. Child prints a version from Deloney's
Garland of Goodwill as reprinted by the Percy Society (vol. xxx.
p. 113). The earliest notice of the tune (the new Tantara) to
which this ballad was to be sung is in the year 1590.]

[Pg 246]




  



Long the proud Spaniards had vaunted to conquer us,
Threatning our country with fyer and sword;
Often preparing their navy most sumptuous
With as great plenty as Spain could afford.
Dub a dub, dub a dub, thus strike their drums;
Tantara, tantara, the Englishman comes.[674]                     6

To the seas presentlye went our lord admiral,
With knights couragious and captains full good;
The brave Earl of Essex, a prosperous general,
With him prepared to pass the salt flood.                         10
Dub a dub, &amp;c.

At Plymouth speedilye, took they ship valiantlye,
Braver ships never were seen under sayle,
With their fair colours spread, and streamers ore their head,
Now bragging Spaniards, take heed of your tayle.
Dub a dub, &amp;c.                                                  15

Unto Cales cunninglye, came we most speedilye,
Where the kinges navy securelye did ryde;
Being upon their backs, piercing their butts of sacks,
Ere any Spaniards our coming descryde.                            20
Dub a dub, &amp;c.

Great was the crying, the running and ryding,[675]
Which at that season was made in that place;
The beacons were fyred, as need then required;
To hyde their great treasure they had little space.
Dub a dub, &amp;c.                                                  26
[Pg 247]
There you might see their ships, how they were fyred fast,
And how their men drowned themselves in the sea;
There might you hear them cry, wayle and weep piteously,
When they saw no shift to scape thence away.                      30
Dub a dub, &amp;c.

The great St. Phillip, the pryde of the Spaniards,
Was burnt to the bottom, and sunk in the sea;
But the St. Andrew, and eke the St. Matthew,
Wee took in fight manfullye and brought away.[676]                35
Dub a dub, &amp;c.

The Earl of Essex most valiant and hardye,
With horsemen and footmen march'd up to the town;[677]
The Spanyards, which saw them, were greatly alarmed,
Did fly for their savegard, and durst not come down.
Dub a dub, &amp;c.                                                  41

Now, quoth the noble Earl, courage my soldiers all,
Fight and be valiant, the spoil you shall have;
And b&egrave; well rewarded all from the great to the small;[678]
But looke that the women and children you save.[679]
Dub a dub, &amp;c.                                                  46

The Spaniards at that sight, thinking it vain to fight,[680]
Hung upp flags of truce and yielded the towne;[681]
Wee marched in presentlye, decking the walls on hye,
With English colours which purchas'd renowne.[682]                50
Dub a dub, &amp;c.
[Pg 248]
Entering the houses then, of the most richest men,
For gold and treasure we searched eche day;
In s&ograve;me places w&egrave; did find, pyes baking left behind,[683]
Meate at fire rosting, and folkes run away.[684]                  55
Dub a dub, &amp;c.

Full of rich merchandize, every shop catch'd our eyes,[685]
Damasks and sattens and velvets full fayre:
Wh[i]ch soldiers m&egrave;asur'd out by the length of their swords;
Of all commodities eche had a share.[686]                         60
Dub a dub, &amp;c.

Thus Cales was taken, and our brave general
March'd to the market-place, where he did stand:
There many prisoners fell to our several shares,[687]
Many crav'd mercye, and mercye they fannd.[688]                   65
Dub a dub, &amp;c.

When our brave general saw they delayed all,[689]
And would not ransome their towne as they said,
With their fair wanscots, their presses and bedsteds,
Their joint-stools and tables a fire we made;[690]                70
And when the town burned all in a flame,
With tara, tantara, away wee all came.[691]

XXIII.

THE SPANISH LADY'S LOVE.



  

This beautiful old ballad most probably took its rise
from one of these descents made on the Spanish coasts
in the time of queen Elizabeth; and in all likelihood
from that which is celebrated in the foregoing ballad.

It was a tradition in the West of England, that the person
admired by the Spanish lady was a gentleman of the Popham
family [Sir John Popham], and that her picture, with the pearl
necklace mentioned in the ballad, was not many years ago preserved
at Littlecot, near Hungerford, Wilts, the seat of that respectable
family.

Another tradition hath pointed out Sir Richard Levison, of
Trentham, in Staffordshire, as the subject of this ballad; who
married Margaret daughter of Charles Earl of Nottingham; and
was eminently distinguished as a naval officer and commander in
all the expeditions against the Spaniards in the latter end of
Q. Elizabeth's reign, particularly in that to Cadiz in 1596, when
he was aged 27. He died in 1605, and has a monument, with
his effigy in brass, in Wolverhampton church.

It is printed from an ancient black-letter copy, corrected in part
by the Editor's folio MS.





[Sir John Popham and Sir Richard Levison are not the only
candidates for the honour of being associated with the Spanish
Lady, for strong claims have also been brought forward in favour
of Sir Urias Legh of Adlington, Cheshire, and of Sir John Bolle of
Thorpe Hall, Lincolnshire. A descendant of the latter worthy
wrote a letter in his favour, which appeared in the Times of May 1,
1846, and from which the following particulars are extracted:&mdash;"In
Illingworth's Topographical Account of Scampton, with Anecdotes
of the family of Bolles, it is stated, 'the portrait of Sir John,
drawn in 1596, at the age of thirty-six years, having on him the
gold chain given him by the Spanish Lady, &amp;c., is still in the possession
of Captain Birch.' That portrait is now in the possession
of Captain Birch's successor, Thomas Bosvile, Esq., of
Ravensfield Park, Yorkshire." The writer of the letter signs
himself Charles Lee, and dates from Coldrey, Hants. He adds
another extract from Illingworth's Scampton, which is as follows:
"On Sir John Bolle's departure from Cadiz, the Spanish
Lady sent as presents to his wife, a profusion of jewels, and other[Pg 250]
valuables, amongst which was her portrait, drawn in green, plate,
money, and other treasure. Some articles are still in the possession
of the family, though her picture was unfortunately and by accident,
disposed of about half a century since. This portrait being
drawn in green, gave occasion to her being called in the neighbourhood
of Thorpe Hall, the Green Lady, where to this day
there is a traditionary superstition among the vulgar that Thorpe
Hall was haunted by the Green Lady, who used nightly to take
her seat in a particular tree near the mansion."

Mr. Chappell points out that this ballad is quoted in Cupid's
Whirligig, 1616, and parodied in Rowley's A Match at Midnight,
1633. It is also quoted in Mrs. Behn's Comedy, The Rovers, or
the banished Cavaliers, and in Richard Brome's Northern Lasse.

Shenstone was not satisfied with the beautiful simplicity of this
charming ballad, and attempted in his Moral Tale of Love and
Honour to place it before his readers "in less grovelling accents
than the simple guise of ancient record." The mode he adopted
was to spin it out by the frequent introduction of Ah me and
'tis true, and addresses to the "generous maid," Elvira, Iberia, &amp;c.
Wordsworth acted far differently, when he founded his exquisite
Armenian Lady's Love upon this ballad:


"You have heard of a Spanish Lady,
How she wooed an English man;
Hear now of a fair Armenian,
Daughter of the proud Sold&agrave;n."




The copy in the folio MS. (ed. Hales and Furnivall, vol. iii.
p. 393) begins with verse 33, the early part having been torn
out.]




  



Will you hear a Spanish lady,
How she wooed an English man?
Garments gay as rich as may be
Decked with jewels she had on.
Of a comely countenance and grace was she,                           5
And by birth and parentage of high degree.

As his prisoner there he kept her,
In his hands her life did lye;
Cupid's bands did tye them faster
By the liking of an eye.                                          10[Pg 251]
In his courteous company was all her joy,
To favour him in any thing she was not coy.

But at last there came commandment
For to set the ladies free,
With their jewels still adorned,                                    15
None to do them injury.
Then said this lady mild, Full woe is me;
O let me still sustain this kind captivity!

Gallant captain, shew some pity
To a ladye in distresse;                                          20
Leave me not within this city,
For to dye in heavinesse:
Thou hast set this present day my body free,
But my heart in prison still remains with thee.

"How should'st thou, fair lady, love me,                            25
Whom thou knowst thy country's foe?
Thy fair wordes make me suspect thee:
Serpents lie where flowers grow."
All the harm I wishe to thee, most courteous knight,
God grant the same upon my head may fully light.                    30

Blessed be the time and season,
That you came on Spanish ground;
If our foes you may be termed,
Gentle foes we have you found:
With our city, you have won our hearts eche one,                    35
Then to your country bear away, that is your owne.

"Rest you still, most gallant lady;
Rest you still, and weep no more;
Of fair lovers there is plenty,
Spain doth yield a wonderous store."                              40
Spaniards fraught with jealousy we often find,
But Englishmen through all the world are counted kind.[Pg 252]
Leave me not unto a Spaniard,
You alone enjoy my heart;
I am lovely, young, and tender,                                     45
Love is likewise my desert:
Still to serve thee day and night my mind is prest;
The wife of every Englishman is counted blest.

"It wold be a shame, fair lady,
For to bear a woman hence;                                        50
English soldiers never carry
Any such without offence."
I'll quickly change myself, if it be so,
And like a page Ile follow thee, where'er thou go.[692]

"I have neither gold nor silver                                     55
To maintain thee in this case,
And to travel is great charges,
As you know in every place."
My chains and jewels every one shal be thy own,
And eke five hundred[693] pounds in gold that lies unknown.         60

"On the seas are many dangers,
Many storms do there arise,
Which wil be to ladies dreadful,
And force tears from watery eyes."
Well in troth I shall endure extremity,[694]                        65
For I could find in heart to lose my life for thee.[695]

"Courteous ladye, leave this fancy,
Here comes all that breeds the strife;[696]
I in England have already
A sweet woman to my wife:                                         70
I will not falsify my vow for gold nor gain,
Nor yet for all the fairest dames that live in Spain."
[Pg 253]
O how happy is that woman
That enjoys so true a friend!
Many happy days God send her;[697]                                  75
Of my suit I make an end:[698]
On my knees I pardon crave for my offence,[699]
Which did from love and true affection first commence.[700]

Commend me to thy lovely lady,
Bear to her this chain of gold;[701]                              80
And these bracelets for a token;
Grieving that I was so bold:
All my jewels in like sort take thou with thee,[702]
For they are fitting for thy wife, but not for me.[703]

I will spend my days in prayer,                                     85
Love and all her laws[704] defye;
In a nunnery will I shroud mee
Far from any companye:[705]
But ere my prayers have an end, be sure of this,
To pray for thee and for thy love I will not miss.                  90

Thus farewell, most gallant captain!
Farewell too my heart's content![706]
Count not Spanish ladies wanton,
Though to thee my love was bent:
Joy and true prosperity goe still with thee![707]                   95
"The like fall ever to thy share, most fair lad&igrave;e."

XXIV.

ARGENTILE AND CURAN,



  

Is extracted from an ancient historical poem in XIII.
Books, intitled, Albion's England, by William Warner:
"An author (says a former editor,) only unhappy in the
choice of his subject, and measure of his verse. His
poem is an epitome of the British history, and written with great
learning, sense, and spirit. In some places fine to an extraordinary
degree, as I think will eminently appear in the ensuing episode
(of Argentile and Curan). A tale full of beautiful incidents in
the romantic taste, extremely affecting, rich in ornament, wonderfully
various in style; and in short, one of the most beautiful
pastorals I ever met with." (Muses Library, 1738, 8vo.) To his
merit nothing can be objected unless perhaps an affected quaintness
in some of his expressions, and an indelicacy in some of his
pastoral images.

Warner is said, by A. Wood,[708] to have been a Warwickshire
man, and to have been educated in Oxford, at Magdalene-hall:
as also in the latter part of his life to have been retained in the
service of Henry Cary Lord Hunsdon, to whom he dedicates his
poem. However that may have been, new light is thrown upon
his history, and the time and manner of his death are now ascertained,
by the following extract from the parish register book of
Amwell, in Hertfordshire; which was obligingly communicated
to the Editor by Mr. Hoole, the very ingenious translator of
Tasso, &amp;c.

(1608&mdash;1609.) "Master William Warner, a man of good yeares
and of honest reputation; by his profession an Atturnye of the
Common Pleas; author of Albions England, diynge suddenly in
the night in his bedde, without any former complaynt or sicknesse,
on thursday night beeinge the 9th daye of March; was buried the
satturday following, and lyeth in the church at the corner under
the stone of Walter Ffader." Signed Tho. Hassall Vicarius.

Though now Warner is so seldom mentioned, his contemporaries
ranked him on a level with Spenser, and called them the Homer
and Virgil of their age.[709] But Warner rather resembled Ovid,
whose Metamorphoses he seems to have taken for his model, having
deduced a perpetual poem from the deluge down to the &aelig;ra of
[Pg 255]Elizabeth, full of lively digressions and entertaining episodes.
And though he is sometimes harsh, affected, and obscure, he
often displays a most charming and pathetic simplicity: as where
he describes Eleanor's harsh treatment of Rosamond:


"With that she dasht her on the lippes
So dyed double red:
Hard was the heart that gave the blow,
Soft were those lippes that bled."


The edition of Albion's England here followed was printed in
4to. 1602; said in the title-page to have been "first penned and
published by William Warner, and now revised and newly enlarged
by the same author." The story of Argentile and Curan is I believe
the poet's own invention; it is not mentioned in any of our
chronicles. It was however so much admired, that not many
years after he published it, came out a larger poem on the same
subject in stanzas of six lines, intitled, The most pleasant and delightful
historie of Curan a prince of Danske, and the fayre princesse
Argentile, daughter and heyre to Adelbright, sometime king of Northumberland,
&amp;c. by William Webster, London, 1617, in 8 sheets 4to.
An indifferent paraphrase of the following poem.&mdash;This episode of
Warner's has also been altered into the common ballad, of the two
young Princes on Salisbury Plain, which is chiefly composed of
Warner's lines, with a few contractions and interpolations, but all
greatly for the worse. See the collection of Hist. Ballads, 1727,
3 vols. 12mo.





[Percy had already in the first volume quoted from Warner's
poem the story of the Patient Countess.]




  



The Bruton's 'being' departed hence seaven kingdoms here begonne,
Where diversly in divers broyles the Saxons lost and wonne.
King Edel and king Adelbright in Diria jointly raigne;
In loyal concorde during life these kingly friends remaine.
When Adelbright should leave his life, to Edel thus he sayes;        5
By those same bondes of happie love, that held us friends alwaies;[Pg 256]
By our by-parted crowne, of which the moyetie is mine;
By God, to whom my soule must passe, and so in time may thine;
I pray thee, nay I c&ograve;njure thee, to nourish, as thine owne,
Thy niece, my daughter Argentile, till she to age be growne;        10
And then, as thou receivest it, resigne to her my throne.
A promise had for his bequest, the testat&ograve;r he dies;
But all that Edel undertooke, he afterwards denies.
Yet well he 'fosters for' a time the damsell that was growne
The fairest lady under heaven; whose beautie being knowne,          15
A many princes seeke her love; but none might her obtaine;
For grippell[710] Edel to himselfe her kingdome sought to gaine;
And for that cause from sight of such he did his ward restraine.
By chance one Curan, sonne unto a prince in Danske,[711] did see
The maid, with whom he fell in love, as much as man might bee.      20
Unhappie youth, what should he doe? his saint was kept in mewe;[712]
Nor he, nor any noble-man admitted to her vewe.
One while in melancholy fits he pines himselfe awaye;
Anon he thought by force of arms to win her if he maye:
And still against the kings restraint did secretly invay.           25
At length the high controller Love, whom none may disobay,[Pg 257]
Imbased him from lordlines into a kitchen drudge,
That so at least of life or death she might become his judge.
Accesse so had to see and speake, he did his love bewray,
And tells his birth: her answer was, she husbandles would stay.     30
Meane while the king did beate his braines, his booty to atchieve,
Nor caring what became of her, so he by her might thrive;
At last his resolution was some pessant should her wive.
And (which was working to his wish) he did observe with joye
How Curan, whom he thought a drudge, scapt many an amorous toye.[713]35
The king, perceiving such his veine, promotes his vassal still,
Lest that the basenesse of the man should lett,[714] perhaps, his will.
Assured therefore of his love, but not suspecting who
The lover was, the king himselfe in his behalf did woe.
The lady resolute from love, unkindly takes that he                 40
Should barre the noble, and unto so base a match agree:
And therefore shifting out of doores, departed thence by stealth;
Preferring povertie before a dangerous life in wealth.
When Curan heard of her escape, the anguish in his hart[Pg 258]
Was more than much, and after her from court he did depart;         45
Forgetfull of himselfe, his birth, his country, friends, and all,
And only minding (whom he mist) the foundresse of his thrall.
Nor meanes he after to frequent or court, or stately townes,
But solitarily to live amongst the country grownes.[715]
A brace of years he lived thus, well pleased so to live,            50
And shepherd-like to feed a flocke himselfe did wholly give.
So wasting, love, by worke, and want, grew almost to the waine:
But then began a second love, the worser of the twaine.
A country wench, a neatherds maid, where Curan kept his sheepe,
Did feed her drove: and now on her was all the shepherds keepe.     55
He borrowed on the working daies his holy russets oft,[716]
And of the bacon's fat, to make his startops[717] blacke and soft.
And least his tarbox[718] should offend, he left it at the folde:
Sweete growte,[719] or whig,[720] his bottle had, as much as it might holde.
A sheeve[721] of bread as browne as nut, and cheese as white as snow,60
And wildings,[722] or the seasons fruit he did in scrip bestow,[Pg 259]
And whilst his py-bald curre did sleepe, and sheep-hooke lay him by,
On hollow quilles of oten straw he piped melody
But when he spyed her his saint, he wip'd his greasie shooes,
And clear'd the drivell from his beard, and thus the shepheard wooes.65
"I have, sweet wench, a peece of cheese, as good as tooth may chawe,
And bread and wildings souling[723] well, (and therewithall did drawe
His lardrie) and in 'yeaning' see yon crumpling[724] ewe, quoth he,[725]
Did twinne this fall, and twin shouldst thou, if I might tup[726] with thee.
Thou art too elvish, faith thou art, too elvish and too coy:        70
Am I, I pray thee, beggarly, that such a flock enjoye?
I wis I am not: yet that thou doest hold me in disdaine
Is brimme[727] abroad, and made a gybe to all that keepe this plaine.
There be as quaint[728] (at least that thinke themselves as quaint) that crave
The match, that thou, I wot not why, maist, but mislik'st to have.  75
How wouldst thou match? (for well I wot, thou art a female) I,
Her know not here that willingly with maiden-head would die.[729]
The plowmans labour hath no end, and he a churle will prove:[Pg 260]
The craftsman hath more worke in hand then fitteth unto love:
The merchant, traffiquing abroad, suspects his wife at home:        80
A youth will play the wanton; and an old man prove a mome.[730]
Then chuse a shepheard: with the sun he doth his flocke unfold,
And all the day on hill or plaine he merrie chat can hold;
And with the sun doth folde againe; then jogging home betime,
He turnes a crab, or turnes a round, or sings some merry ryme.[731] 85
Nor lacks he gleeful tales, whilst round the nut-brown bowl doth trot;[732]
And sitteth singing care away, till he to bed be got:
Theare sleepes he soundly all the night, forgetting morrow-cares:
Nor feares he blasting of his corne, nor uttering of his wares;
Or storms by seas, or stirres on land, or cracke of credit lost;    90
Not spending franklier than his flocke, shall still defray the cost.
Well wot I, sooth they say, that say more quiet nights and daies
The shepheard sleeps and wakes, than he whose cattel he doth graize.
Beleeve me, lasse, a king is but a man, and so am I:
Content is worth a monarchie, and mischiefs hit the hie;            95[Pg 261]
As late it did a king and his not dwelling far from hence,
Who left a daughter, save thyselfe, for fair a matchless wench."&mdash;
Here did he pause, as if his tongue had done his heart offence.
The neatresse,[733] longing for the rest, did egge him on to tell
How faire she was, and who she was. "She bore, quoth he, the bell  100
For beautie: though I clownish am, I know what beautie is;
Or did I not, at seeing thee, I senceles were to mis.
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *
Her stature comely, tall; her gate well graced; and her wit
To marvell at, not meddle with, as matchless I omit.
A globe-like head, a gold-like haire, a forehead smooth, and hie,  105
An even nose; on either side did shine a grayish eie:
Two rosie cheeks, round ruddy lips, white just-set teeth within;
A mouth in meane;[734] and underneathe a round and dimpled chin.
Her snowie necke, with blewish veines, stood bolt upright upon
Her portly shoulders; beating balles her veined breasts, anon      110
Adde more to beautie. Wand-like was her middle falling still,
And rising whereas women rise: * * *&mdash;imagine nothing ill.
And more, her long, and limber armes had white and azure wrists;[Pg 262]
And slender fingers aunswere to her smooth and lillie fists.
A legge in print, a pretie foot; conjecture of the rest:
For amorous eies, observing forme, think parts obscured best.      116
With these, O raretie! with these her tong of speech was spare;
But speaking, Venus seem'd to speake, the balle from Ide to bear.
With Ph&oelig;be, Juno, and with both herselfe contends in face;
Wheare equall mixture did not want of milde and stately grace.     120
Her smiles were sober, and her lookes were chearefull unto all:
Even such as neither wanton seeme, nor waiward; mell,[735] nor gall.
A quiet minde, a patient moode, and not disdaining any;
Not gybing, gadding, gawdy: and sweete faculties had many.
A nimph, no tong, no heart, no eie, might praise, might wish, might see;125
For life, for love, for forme; more good, more worth, more faire than shee.
Yea such an one, as such was none, save only she was such:
Of Argentile to say the most, were to be silent much."
I knew the lady very well, but worthles of such praise,
The neatresse said: and muse I do, a shepheard thus should blaze   130
The 'coate' of beautie[736]. Credit me, thy latter speech bewraies[Pg 263]
Thy clownish shape a coined shew. But wherefore dost thou weepe?
The shepheard wept, and she was woe, and both doe silence keepe.
"In troth, quoth he, I am not such, as seeming I professe:
But then for her, and now for thee, I from myselfe digresse.       135
Her loved I (wretch that I am a recreant to be)
I loved her, that hated love, but now I die for thee.
At Kirkland is my fathers court, and Curan is my name,
In Edels court sometimes in pompe, till love countrould the same:
But now&mdash;what now?&mdash;deare heart, how now? what ailest thou to weepe?"140
The damsell wept, and he was woe, and both did silence keepe.
I graunt, quoth she, it was too much that you did love so much:
But whom your former could not move, your second love doth touch.
Thy twice-beloved argentile submitteth her to thee,
And for thy double love presents herself a single fee,
In passion not in person chang'd, and I, my lord, am she.          146
They sweetly surfeiting in joy, and silent for a space,
When as the extasie had end, did tenderly imbrace;
And for their wedding, and their wish got fitting time and place.
Not England (for of Hengist then was named so this land)           150
Then Curan had an hardier knight; his force could none withstand:[Pg 264]
Whose sheep-hooke laid apart, he then had higher things in hand.
First, making knowne his lawfull claime in Argentile her right,
He warr'd in Diria[737], and he wonne Bernicia[737] too in fight:
And so from trecherous Edel tooke at once his life and crowne,     155
And of Northumberland was king, long raigning in renowne.[738]

CORIN'S FATE.



  

Only the three first stanzas of this song are ancient;
these are extracted from a small quarto MS. in the
Editor's possession, written in the time of Q. Elizabeth.
As they seemed to want application, this has been attempted
by a modern hand.




  



Corin, most unhappie swaine,
Whither wilt thou drive thy flocke?
Little foode is on the plaine;
Full of danger is the rocke:
[Pg 265]
Wolfes and beares doe kepe the woodes;                               5
Forests tangled are with brakes:
Meadowes subject are to floodes;
Moores are full of miry lakes.

Yet to shun all plaine, and hill,
Forest, moore, and meadow-ground,                                 10
Hunger will as surely kill:
How may then reliefe be found?

[Such is hapless Corins fate:
Since my waywarde love begunne,
Equall doubts begett debate                                         15
What to seeke, and what to shunne.

Spare to speke, and spare to speed;
Yet to speke will move disdaine:
If I see her not I bleed,
Yet her sight augments my paine.                                  20

What may then poor Corin doe?
Tell me, shepherdes, quicklye tell;
For to linger thus in woe
Is the lover's sharpest hell.]

XXVI.

JANE SHORE.



  

Though so many vulgar errors have prevailed concerning
this celebrated courtezan, no character in history
has been more perfectly handed down to us. We
have her portrait drawn by two masterly pens; the
one has delineated the features of her person, the other those
of her character and story. Sir Thomas More drew from the
life, and Drayton has copied an original picture of her. The
reader will pardon the length of the quotations, as they serve to[Pg 266]
correct many popular mistakes relating to her catastrophe. The
first is from Sir Thomas More's History of Richard III. written in
1513, about thirty years after the death of Edw. IV.

"Now then by and by, as it wer for anger, not for covetise, the
protector sent into the house of Shores wife (for her husband
dwelled not with her) and spoiled her of al that ever she had,
(above the value of 2 or 3 thousand marks) and sent her body to
prison. And when he had a while laide unto her, for the maner
sake, that she went about to bewitch him, and that she was of
counsel with the lord chamberlein to destroy him: in conclusion
when that no colour could fasten upon these matters, then he layd
heinously to her charge the thing that herselfe could not deny, that
al the world wist was true, and that natheles every man laughed at
to here it then so sodainly so highly taken,&mdash;that she was naught
of her body. And for thys cause (as a goodly continent prince,
clene and fautless of himself, sent oute of heaven into this vicious
world for the amendment of mens maners) he caused the bishop
of London to put her to open pennance, going before the crosse
in procession upon a sonday with a taper in her hand. In which
she went in countenance and pace demure so womanly; and albeit
she was out of al array save her kyrtle only, yet went she so fair
and lovely, namelye, while the wondering of the people caste a
comly rud in her chekes (of which she before had most misse) that
her great shame wan her much praise among those that were more
amorous of her body, then curious of her soule. And many good
folke also, that hated her living, and glad wer to se sin corrected,
yet pittied thei more her penance then rejoiced therin, when thei
considred that the protector procured it more of a corrupt intent,
then any virtuous affeccion.

"This woman was born in London, worshipfully frended, honestly
brought up, and very wel maryed, saving somewhat too soone;
her husbande an honest citizen, yonge, and goodly, and of good
substance. But forasmuche as they were coupled ere she wer wel
ripe, she not very fervently loved, for whom she never longed.
Which was happely the thinge, that the more easily made her
encline unto the king's appetite, when he required her. Howbeit
the respect of his royaltie, the hope of gay apparel, ease, plesure,
and other wanton welth, was able soone to perse a soft tender
hearte. But when the king had abused her, anon her husband (as
he was an honest man, and one that could his good, not presuming
to touch a kinges concubine) left her up to him al together. When
the king died, the lord chamberlen [Hastings] toke her:[739] which
[Pg 267]in the kinges daies, albeit he was sore enamoured upon her, yet
he forbare her, either for reverence, or for a certain friendly faithfulness.

"Proper she was, and faire: nothing in her body that you wold
have changed, but if you would have wished her somewhat higher.
Thus say thei that knew her in her youthe. Albeit some that now
see her (for yet she liveth) deme her never to have bene wel visaged.
Whose jugement seemeth me somewhat like, as though men should
gesse the bewty of one longe before departed, by her scalpe taken
out of the charnel-house; for now is she old, lene, withered, and
dried up, nothing left but ryvilde skin, and hard bone. And yet
being even such, whoso wel advise her visage, might gesse and
devise which partes how filled, wold make it a fair face.

"Yet delited not men so much in her bewty, as in her pleasant
behaviour. For a proper wit had she, and could both rede wel
and write; mery in company, redy and quick of aunswer, neither
mute nor ful of bable; sometime taunting without displeasure, and
not without disport. The king would say, That he had three concubines,
which in three divers properties diversly excelled. One
the meriest, another the wiliest, the thirde the holiest harlot in his
realme, as one whom no man could get out of the church lightly
to any place, but it were to his bed. The other two wer somwhat
greater personages, and natheles of their humilite content to be
nameles, and to forbere the praise of those properties; but the
meriest was the Shoris wife, in whom the king therfore toke
[Pg 268]special pleasure. For many he had, but her he loved, whose
favour, to sai the trouth (for sinne it wer to belie the devil) she
never abused to any mans hurt, but to many a mans comfort and
relief. Where the king toke displeasure, she would mitigate and
appease his mind: where men were out of favour, she wold bring
them in his grace: for many, that had highly offended, shee
obtained pardon: of great forfeitures she gate men remission: and
finally in many weighty sutes she stode many men in gret stede,
either for none or very smal rewardes, and those rather gay than
rich: either for that she was content with the dede selfe well done,
or for that she delited to be sued unto, and to show what she was
able to do wyth the king, or for that wanton women and welthy be
not alway covetous.

"I doubt not some shal think this woman too sleight a thing
to be written of, and set amonge the remembraunces of great
matters: which thei shal specially think, that happely shal esteme
her only by that thei now see her. But me semeth the chaunce so
much the more worthy to be remembred, in how much she is now
in the more beggerly condicion, unfrended and worne out of acquaintance,
after good substance, after as grete favour with the
prince, after as grete sute and seeking to with al those, that in
those days had busynes to spede, as many other men were in their
times, which be now famouse only by the infamy of their il dedes.
Her doinges were not much lesse, albeit thei be muche lesse
remembred because thei were not so evil. For men use, if they
have an evil turne, to write it in marble; and whoso doth us a
good tourne, we write it in duste.[740] Which is not worst proved by
her; for at this daye shee beggeth of many at this daye living, that
at this day had begged, if shee had not bene." See More's workes,
folio, bl. let. 1557, pp. 56, 57.

Drayton has written a poetical epistle from this lady to her royal
lover, and in his notes thereto he thus draws her portrait: "Her
stature was meane, her haire of a dark yellow, her face round and
full, her eye gray, delicate harmony being betwixt each part's proportion,
and each proportion's colour, her body fat, white and smooth,
her countenance cheerfull and like to her condition. The picture
which I have seen of hers was such as she rose out of her bed in the
[Pg 269]morning, having nothing on but a rich mantle cast under one arme
over her shoulder, and sitting on a chaire, on which her naked
arm did lie. What her father's name was, or where she was borne,
is not certainly knowne: but Shore, a young man of right goodly
person, wealth and behaviour, abandoned her bed after the king
had made her his concubine. Richard III. causing her to do open
penance in Paul's church-yard, commanded that no man should
relieve her, which the tyrant did, not so much for his hatred to
sinne, but that by making his brother's life odious, he might cover his
horrible treasons the more cunningly." See England's Heroical
Epistles, by Mich. Drayton, Esq; Lond. 1637, 12mo.

An original picture of Jane Shore almost naked is preserved in
the Provost's Lodgings at Eton; and another picture of her is in
the Provost's Lodge at King's College, Cambridge: to both which
foundations she is supposed to have done friendly offices with
Edward IV. A small quarto Mezzotinto print was taken from
the former of these by J. Faber.

The history of Jane Shore receives new illustration from the
following letter of K. Richard III. which is preserved in the Harl.
MSS. Num. 433, Art. 2378, but of which the copy transmitted to
the Editor has been reduced to modern orthography, &amp;c. It is
said to have been addressed to Russel bp. of Lincoln, lord chancellor,
Anno 1484.

By the King.


"Right Reverend Father in God, &amp;c. signifying unto you, that
it is shewed unto us, that our Servant and Solicitor Thomas Lynom,
marvellously blinded and abused with the late Wife of William
Shore, now living in Ludgate by our commandment, hath made
Contract of Matrimony with her, as it is said, and intendeth, to our
full great marvel, to effect the same. WE, for many causes, would
be sorry that he should be so disposed; pray you therefore to send
for him, and in that ye goodly may, exhort, and stir him to the
contrary: And if ye find him utterly set for to marry her, and none
otherwise would be advertized, then, if it may stand with the laws
of the church, we be content the time of marriage be deferred to
our coming next to London; that upon sufficient Surety found of
her good abearing, ye do so send for her Keeper, and discharge
him of our said commandment, by Warrant of these, committing
her to the rule, and guiding of her Father, or any other, by your
direction, in the mean season. Given, &amp;c.

"RIC. Rex."

It appears from two articles in the same MS. that K. Richard
had granted to the said Thomas Linom the office of King's Solicitor
(Art. 134.), and also the Manor of Colmeworth, com. Bedf. to him
and his Heirs Male (Art. 596.)

[Pg 270]

The following ballad is printed (with some corrections) from an
old black-letter copy in the Pepys collection. Its full title is, The
woefull lamentation of Jane Shore, a goldsmith's wife in London,
sometime king Edward IV. his concubine. To the tune of Live with
me, &amp;c. (See the first volume.) To every stanza is annexed the
following burthen:


"Then maids and wives in time amend,
For love and beauty will have end."






[The tale of Jane Shore's sufferings has found frequent narrators.
The first known ballad upon her story was written by Thomas
Churchyard (who died in 1604) and is included in the Mirror for
Magistrates. The ballad here printed is attributed to Thomas
Deloney, and was entered on the books of the Stationers' Company
to William White, printer, on the 11th of June, 1603, but no
copy of this edition is known to exist. Mr. Chappell remarks that
no copy in any of the collections can be dated "earlier than
Charles the Second's time, or at most than the Protectorate"
(Roxburghe Ballads, vol. i. p. 479). It is printed in the Collection
of Old Ballads, 1723 (vol. i. p. 145), and in the same collection is
a burlesque song called King Edward and Jane Shore (vol. i.
p. 153). The Roxburghe copy has a second part which Mr. Chappell
says is "probably by another hand and of later date." Deloney
has paid very little attention to facts, and many of his statements
are groundless, for instance no one was hanged for succouring
Jane (vv. 105-112), and instead of dying of hunger in a
ditch (vv. 125-132), she survived her penance nearly fifty years.
(She died in the 18th year of Henry VIII.'s reign.) Her husband
is named Matthew Shore in verse 13, but we have the
best authority for affirming that his true name was William.
Richard III. followed Jane Shore with unrelenting hate, and not
content with making her do penance, clapping her in prison and
depriving her of all her property, which amounted to the value of
3000 marks, equal to about &pound;20,000 of our present money, he
prevented her from marrying a respectable man.

There is no date to the paper printed above, but as John Russell,
D.D., Bishop of Lincoln, was Richard's Chancellor only from
Nov. 1484 to July 1485, we can fix it pretty closely.

According to Mr. Nugent Bell, in his Huntingdon Peerage, the
name of the father of Jane Shore was Thomas Wainstead. Granger
says that the Duchess of Montagu had a lock of her hair which
looked as if it had been powdered with gold dust. For further
information, see Some Particulars of the Life of Jane Shore, by the
Rev. Mark Noble, in Brayley's Graphic Illustrator, pp. 49-64.]

Of Rosamonde that was so faire,
Had cause her sorrowes to declare,
Then let Jane Shore with sorrowe sing,
That was beloved of a king.

In maiden yeares my beautye bright                                   5
Was loved dear of lord and knight;
But yet the love that they requir'd,
It was not as my friends desir'd.

My parents they, for thirst of gaine,
A husband for me did obtaine;                                       10
And I, their pleasure to fulfille,
Was forc'd to wedd against my wille.

To Matthew Shore I was a wife,
Till lust brought ruine to my life;
And then my life I lewdlye spent,                                   15
Which makes my soul for to lament.

In Lombard-street I once did dwelle,
As London yet can witness welle;
Where many gallants did beholde
My beautye in a shop of golde.                                      20

I spred my plumes, as wantons doe,
Some sweet and secret friende to wooe,
Because chast love I did not finde
Agreeing to my wanton minde.

At last my name in court did ring                                   25
Into the eares of Englandes king,
Who came and lik'd, and love requir'd,
But I made coye what he desir'd;

Yet Mistress Blague, a neighbour neare,
Whose friendship I esteemed deare,                                  30
Did saye, It was a gallant thing
To be beloved of a king.[Pg 272]

By her persuasions I was led,
For to defile my marriage-bed,
And wronge my wedded husband Shore,                                 35
Whom I had married yeares before.

In heart and mind I did rejoyce,
That I had made so sweet a choice;
And therefore did my state resigne,
To be king Edward's concubine.                                      40

From city then to court I went,
To reape the pleasures of content;
There had the joyes that love could bring,
And knew the secrets of a king.

When I was thus advanc'd on highe                                   45
Commanding Edward with mine eye,
For Mrs. Blague I in short space
Obtainde a livinge from his grace.

No friende I had but in short time
I made unto a promotion climbe;                                     50
But yet for all this costlye pride,
My husbande could not mee abide.

His bed, though wronged by a king,
His heart with deadlye griefe did sting;
From England then he goes away                                      55
To end his life beyond the sea.

He could not live to see his name
Impaired by my wanton shame;
Although a prince of peerlesse might
Did reape the pleasure of his right.                                60

Long time I lived in the courte,
With lords and ladies of great sorte;
And when I smil'd all men were glad,
But when I frown'd my prince grewe sad.[Pg 273]

But yet a gentle minde I bore                                       65
To helplesse people, that were poore;
I still redrest the orphans crye,
And sav'd their lives condemnd to dye.

I still had ruth on widowes tears,
I succour'd babes of tender yeares;                                 70
And never look'd for other gaine
But love and thankes for all my paine.

At last my royall king did dye,
And then my dayes of woe grew nighe;
When crook-back Richard got the crowne,                             75
King Edwards friends were soon put downe.

I then was punisht for my sin,
That I so long had lived in;
Yea, every one that was his friend,
This tyrant brought to shamefull end.                               80

Then for my lewd and wanton life,
That made a strumpet of a wife,
I penance did in Lombard-street,
In shamefull manner in a sheet.

Where many thousands did me viewe,                                  85
Who late in court my credit knewe;
Which made the teares run down my face,
To thinke upon my foul disgrace.

Not thus content, they took from mee
My goodes, my livings, and my fee,                                  90
And charg'd that none should me relieve,
Nor any succour to me give.

Then unto Mrs. Blague I went,
To whom my jewels I had sent,
In hope therebye to ease my want,                                   95
When riches fail'd, and love grew scant:[Pg 274]

But she denyed to me the same
When in my need for them I came:
To recompence my former love,
Out of her doores shee did me shove.                               100

So love did vanish with my state,
Which now my soul repents too late;
Therefore example take by mee,
For friendship parts in povertie.

But yet one friend among the rest,                                 105
Whom I before had seen distrest,
And sav'd his life, condemn'd to die,
Did give me food to succour me:

For which, by lawe, it was decreed
That he was hanged for that deed;                                  110
His death did grieve me so much more,
Than had I dyed myself therefore.

Then those to whom I had done good,
Durst not afford me any food;
Whereby I begged all the day,                                      115
And still in streets by night I lay.

My gowns beset with pearl and gold,
Were turn'd to simple garments old;
My chains and gems and golden rings,
To filthy rags and loathsome things.                               120

Thus was I scorn'd of maid and wife,
For leading such a wicked life;
Both sucking babes and children small,
Did make their pastime at my fall.

I could not get one bit of bread,                                  125
Whereby my hunger might be fed:
Nor drink, but such as channels yield,
Or stinking ditches in the field.[Pg 275]

Thus, weary of my life, at lengthe
I yielded up my vital strength                                     130
Within a ditch of loathsome scent,
Where carrion dogs did much frequent:

The which now since my dying daye,
Is Shoreditch call'd, as writers saye[741];
Which is a witness of my sinne,                                    135
For being concubine to a king.

You wanton wives, that fall to lust,
Be you assur'd that God is just;
Whoredome shall not escape his hand,
Nor pride unpunish'd in this land.                                 140

If God to me such shame did bring,
That yielded only to a king,
How shall they scape that daily run
To practise sin with every one?

You husbands, match not but for love,                              145
Lest some disliking after prove;
Women, be warn'd when you are wives,
What plagues are due to sinful lives:
Then, maids and wives, in time amend,
For love and beauty will have end.                               150

FOOTNOTES:



[739] After the death of Hastings, she was kept by the marquis of
Dorset, son to Edward IV.'s queen. In Rymer's F&oelig;dera is a proclamation
of Richard's, dated at Leicester, Oct. 23, 1483, wherein
a reward of 1000 marks in money, or 100 a year in land is offered
for taking "Thomas late marquis of Dorset," who, "not having
the fear of God, nor the salvation of his own soul, before his eyes,
has damnably debauched and defiled many maids, widows, and
wives, and lived in actual adultery with the wife of Shore." Buckingham
was at that time in rebellion, but as Dorset was not with him,
Richard could not accuse him of treason, and therefore made a
handle of these pretended debaucheries to get him apprehended.
Vide Rym. F&oelig;d. tom. xij. pag. 204.




[The Rev. Mark Noble writes as follows of the charge made by
Richard of Dorset's living in adultery with Jane Shore.&mdash;"It could
not be before she was taken by Edward; it could not be during
that king's life; it could not be afterwards, by Richard's own
account, for by his proclamation she then was the mistress of
Hastings to the night preceding his being put to death. It could
not be after that catastrophe, for ever after then Richard kept
her either in the Tower or in Ludgate a close prisoner."&mdash;Brayley's
Graphic and Historical Illustrator, 1834, p. 55.]





[740] These words of Sir Thomas More probably suggested to
Shakespeare that proverbial reflection in Hen. VIII. act iv. sc. 2.



"Men's evill manners live in brass: their virtues
We write in water."



Shakesp. in his play of Rich. III. follows More's Hist. of that
reign, and therefore could not but see this passage.



[741] But it had this name long before; being so called from its
being a common Sewer (vulgarly Shore) or drain. See Stow.


[Weever states that it was named from the Lord of the Manor.
Sir John de Sordig was Ambassador from Edward III. to the Pope,
to remonstrate with his Holiness on his claim to present foreigners
to English livings.]





XXVII.

CORYDON'S DOLEFUL KNELL.



  

This little simple elegy is given, with some corrections,
from two copies, one of which is in The golden garland
of princely delights.

The burthen of the song, Ding Dong, &amp;c. is at present
appropriated to burlesque subjects, and therefore may excite only
ludicrous ideas in a modern reader; but in the time of our poet it
usually accompanied the most solemn and mournful strains. Of
this kind is that fine a&euml;rial Dirge in Shakespear's Tempest:


"Full fadom five thy father lies,
Of his bones are corrall made;
Those are pearles that were his eyes;
Nothing of him, that doth fade,
But doth suffer a sea-change
Into something rich and strange:
Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell,
Harke now I heare them, Ding dong bell."
"Burthen, Ding Dong."


I make no doubt but the poet intended to conclude the above air
in a manner the most solemn and expressive of melancholy.




  



My Phillida, adieu love!
For evermore farewel!
Ay me! I've lost my true love,
And thus I ring her knell,
Ding dong, ding dong, ding dong,                                   5
My Phillida is dead!
I'll stick a branch of willow
At my fair Phillis' head.

For my fair Phillida
Our bridal bed was made:                                          10
But 'stead of silkes so gay,
She in her shroud is laid.
Ding, &amp;c.[Pg 277]

Her corpse shall be attended
By maides in fair array,
Till the obsequies are ended,                                       15
And she is wrapt in clay.
Ding, &amp;c.

Her herse it shall be carried
By youths, that do excell;
And when that she is buried,
I thus will ring her knell,                                       20
Ding, &amp;c.

A garland shall be framed
By art and natures skill,
Of sundry-colour'd flowers,
In token of good-will[742]:
Ding, &amp;c.

And sundry-colour'd ribbands                                        25
On it I will bestow;
But chiefly black and yellowe[743]:
With her to grave shall go.
Ding, &amp;c.

I'll decke her tomb with flowers,
The rarest ever seen,                                             30
And with my tears, as showers,
I'll keepe them fresh and green.
Ding, &amp;c.

Instead of fairest colours,
Set forth with curious art[744],
Ding, &amp;c.[Pg 278]
Her image shall be painted                                          35
On my distressed heart.

And thereon shall be graven
Her epitaph so faire,
"Here lies the loveliest maiden,
That e'er gave shepheard care."                                   40
Ding, &amp;c.

In sable will I mourne;
Blacke shall be all my weede;
Ay me! I am forlorne,
Now Phillida is dead!
Ding dong, ding dong, ding dong,
My Phillida is dead!                                        46
I'll stick a branch of willow
At my fair Phillis' head

I.

THE COMPLAINT OF CONSCIENCE.



  

I shall begin this third book with an old allegoric
Satire; a manner of moralizing, which, if it was not
first introduced by the author of Pierce Plowman's
Visions,[745] was at least chiefly brought into repute by
that ancient Satirist. It is not so generally known that the kind
of verse used in this ballad hath any affinity with the peculiar
metre of that writer, for which reason I shall throw together some
cursory remarks on that very singular species of versification, the
nature of which has been so little understood.[746]

The following Song, intitled, The Complaint of Conscience, is
printed from the Editor's folio Manuscript: Some corruptions in
the old copy are here corrected; but with notice to the Reader,
wherever it was judged necessary, by inclosing the corrections
between inverted 'commas.'





[This poem entitled Conscience is printed in Hales and Furnivall's
edition of the Percy folio MS. (vol. ii. p. 174), with a long preface
by Mr. Furnivall, on the earnest side of Early English literature.

It will be seen from the foot-notes that Percy left many of his
corrections unnoticed.]

[Pg 282]




  



As I walked of late by 'an' wood side,[747]
To God for to meditate was my entent;
Where under a hawthorne I suddenlye spyed[748]
A silly poore creature ragged and rent,
With bloody teares his face was besprent,[749]                       5
His fleshe and his color consumed away,[749]
And his garments they were all mire, mucke, and clay.[750]

This made me muse, and much 'to' desire
To know what kind of man hee shold bee;
I stept to him straight, and did him require                        10
His name and his secretts to shew unto mee.
His head he cast up, and wooful was hee,
My name, quoth he, is the cause of my care,
And makes me scorned, and left here so bare.

Then straightway he turn'd him, and pray'd 'me' sit downe,[751]     15
And I will, saithe he, declare my whole greefe;
My name is called Conscience:&mdash;wheratt he did frowne,
He pined to repeate it, and grinded his teethe,
'Thoughe now, silly wretche, I'm denyed all releef,'[752]
'Yet' while I was young, and tender of yeeres,[753]               20
I was entertained with kinges, and with peeres.
[Pg 283]
There was none in the court that lived in such fame,[754]
For with the kings councell 'I' sate in commission;[755]
Dukes, earles, and barrons esteem'd of my name;
And how that I liv'd there needs no repetition:                     25
I was ever holden in honest condition,
For howsoever the lawes went in Westminster-hall,
When sentence was given, for me they wold call.

No incomes at all the landlords wold take,
But one pore peny, that was their fine;                             30
And that they acknowledged to be for my sake.
The poore wold doe nothing without councell mine:
I ruled the world with the right line:
For nothing was passed betweene foe and friend,[756]
But Conscience was called to bee at 'the' end.[757]               35

Noe bargaines, nor merchandize merchants wold make[758]
But I was called a wittenesse therto:
No use for noe money, nor forfett wold take,
But I wold controule them, if that they did soe:
'And' that makes me live now in great woe,                          40
For then came in Pride, Sathan's disciple,
That is now entertained with all kind of people.[759]

He brought with him three, whose names 'thus they call'[760]
That is Covetousnes, Lecherye, Usury, beside:
They never prevail'd, till they had wrought my downefall;           45
Soe Pride was entertained, but Conscience decried,[761]
And 'now ever since' abroad have I tryed[762]
To have had entertainment with some one or other;
But I am rejected, and scorned of my brother.
[Pg 284]
Then went I to the Court the gallants to winn,                      50
But the porter kept me out of the gate:[763]
To Bartlemew Spittle[764] to pray for my sinne,[765]
They bade me goe packe, it was fitt for my state;[766]
Goe, goe, threed-bare Conscience, and seeke thee a mate.
Good Lord, long preserve my king, prince, and queene,             55
With whom evermore I esteemed have been.[767]

Then went I to London, where once I did 'dwell':[768]
But they bade away with me, when they knew my name;
For he will undoe us to bye and to sell!                            59
They bade me goe packe me, and hye me for shame;
They lought[769] at my raggs, and there had good game;
This is old threed-bare Conscience, that dwelt with saint Peter:
But they wold not admitt me to be a chimney-sweeper.

Not one wold receive me, the Lord 'he' doth know;[770]
I having but one poor pennye in my purse,                           65
On an awle and some patches I did it bestow;[771]
'For' I thought better cobble shooes than doe worse.[772]
Straight then all the coblers began for to curse,[773]
And by statute wold prove me a rogue, and forlorne,[774]
And whipp me out of towne to 'seeke' where I was borne.[775]      70
[Pg 285]
Then did I remember, and call to my minde,
The Court of Conscience where once I did sit:[776]
Not doubting but there I some favor shold find,[777]
For my name and the place agreed soe fit;
But there of my purpose I fayled a whit,                            75
For 'thoughe' the judge us'd my name in everye 'commission,'[778]
The lawyers with their quillets[779] wold get 'my' dismission.[780]

Then Westminster-hall was noe place for me;
Good lord! how the Lawyers began to assemble,[781]
And fearfull they were, lest there I shold bee!                     80
The silly poore clarkes began for to tremble;
I showed them my cause, and did not dissemble;
Soe they gave me some money my charges to beare,[782]
But swore me on a booke I must never come there.

Next the Merchants said, Counterfeite, get thee away,[783]          85
Dost thou remember how wee thee found?
We banisht thee the country beyond the salt sea,
And sett thee on shore in the New-found land;
And there thou and wee most friendly shook hand,[784]
And we were right glad when thou didst refuse us;[785]
For when we wold reape profitt here thou woldst accuse us.[786]   91

Then had I noe way, but for to goe on[787]
To Gentlemens houses of an ancyent name;
Declaring my greeffes, and there I made moane,
'Telling' how their forefathers held me in fame:[788]               95
And at letting their farmes 'how always I came'.[789][Pg 286]
They sayd, Fye upon thee! we may thee curse:
'Theire' leases continue, and we fare the worse.[790]

And then I was forced a begging to goe
To husbandmens houses, who greeved right sore,                     100
And sware that their landlords had plagued them so[791]
That they were not able to keepe open doore,
Nor nothing had left to give to the poore:[792]
Therefore to this wood I doe me repayre,[793]
Where hepps and hawes, that is my best fare.                     105

Yet within this same desert some comfort I have
Of Mercy, of Pittye, and of Almes-deeds;
Who have vowed to company me to my grave.
Wee are 'all' put to silence, and live upon weeds,[794]
'And hence such cold house-keeping proceeds':[795]                 110
Our banishment is its utter decay,[796]
The which the riche glutton will answer one day.

Why then, I said to him, me-thinks it were best
To goe to the Clergie; for dailye they preach
Eche man to love you above all the rest;[797]                      115
Of Mercye, and Pittie, and Almes-'deeds', they teach.
O, said he, noe matter of a pin what they preach,[798]
For their wives and their children soe hange them upon,[799]
That whosoever gives almes they will[800] give none.[801]
[Pg 287]
Then laid he him down, and turned him away,                        120
'And' prayd me to goe, and leave him to rest.
I told him, I haplie might yet see the day[802]
For him and his fellowes to live with the best.[803]
First, said he, banish Pride, then all England were blest;[804]
For then those wold love us, that now sell their land,[805]      125
And then good 'house-keeping wold revive' out of hand.[806]

PLAIN TRUTH AND BLIND
IGNORANCE.



  

This excellent old ballad is preserved in the little ancient
miscellany, intitled, The Garland of Goodwill.&mdash;Ignorance
is here made to speak in the broad Somersetshire
dialect. The scene we may suppose to be Glastonbury
Abbey.



Truth.



  



God speed you, ancient father,
And give you a good daye;
What is the cause, I praye you
So sadly here you staye?
And that you keep such gazing                                        5
On this decayed place,
The which, for superstition,
Good princes down did raze?


[Pg 288]

Ignorance.



Chill[807] tell thee, by my vazen[808],
That zometimes che[809] have knowne                               10
A vair and goodly abbey
Stand here of bricke and stone;
And many a holy vrier[810],
As ich[811] may say to thee,
Within these goodly cloysters
Che did full often zee.                                          15


Truth.



Then I must tell thee, father,
In truthe and veriti&egrave;,
A sorte of greater hypocrites
Thou couldst not likely see;                                      20
Deceiving of the simple
With false and feigned lies:
But such an order truly
Christ never did devise.


Ignorance.



Ah! ah! che zmell thee now, man;                                    25
Che know well what thou art;
A vellow of mean learning,
Thee was not worth a vart:
Vor when we had the old lawe,
A merry world was then;                                           30
And every thing was plenty
Among all zorts of men.


[Pg 289]

Truth.



Thou givest me an answer,
As did the Jewes sometimes
Unto the prophet Jeremye,                                           35
When he accus'd their crimes;
'Twas merry, sayd the people,
And joyfull in our rea'me,
When we did offer spice-cakes
Unto the queen of heav'n.                                         40


Ignorance.



Chill tell thee what, good vellowe,
Before the vriers went hence,
A bushell of the best wheat&egrave;
Was zold vor vourteen pence;
And vorty egges a penny,                                            45
That were both good and newe;
And this che zay my zelf have zeene,
And yet ich am no Jewe.


Truth.



Within the sacred bible
We find it written plain,                                         50
The latter days should troublesome
And dangerous be, certaine;
That we should be self-lovers,
And charity wax colde;
Then 'tis not true religion                                         55
That makes thee grief to holde.


Ignorance.



Chill tell thee my opinion plaine,
And choul'd[812] that well ye knewe,
Ich care not for the bible booke;
Tis too big to be true.
Our blessed ladyes psalter[Pg 290]
Zhall for my money goe;
Zuch pretty prayers, as there bee[813],
The bible cannot zhowe.


Truth.



Nowe hast thou spoken trulye,                                       65
For in that book indeede
No mention of our lady,
Or Romish saint we read:
For by the blessed Spirit
That book indited was,                                            70
And not by simple persons,
As was the foolish masse.


Ignorance.



Cham[814] zure they were not voolishe
That made the masse, che trowe;
Why, man,'tis all in Latine,                                        75
And vools no Latine knowe.
Were not our fathers wise men,
And they did like it well;
Who very much rejoyced
To heare the zacring bell?[815]                                   80


Truth.



But many kinges and prophets,
As I may say to thee,
Have wisht the light that you have,
And could it never see:
For what art thou the better                                        85
A Latin song to heare,
And understandest nothing,
That they sing in the quiere?

Ignorance.



O hold thy peace, che pray thee,
The noise was passing trim                                        90
To heare the vriers zinging,
As we did enter in;

But now to zee them wandring                                        95

Truth.



The Lord did give commandment,
No image thou shouldst make,
Nor that unto idolatry
You should your self betake:                                     100
The golden calf of Israel
Moses did therefore spoile;
And Baal's priests and temple
Were brought to utter foile.


Ignorance.



But our lady of Walsinghame                                        105
Was a pure and holy zaint,
And many men in pilgrimage
Did shew to her complaint.
Yea with zweet Thomas Becket,
And many other moe:                                              110
The holy maid of Kent[816] likewise
Did many wonders zhowe.

Such saints are well agreeing
To your profession sure;
And to the men that made them                                      115
So precious and so pure;
The one for being a traytoure,[Pg 292]
Met an untimely death;
The other eke for treason
Did end her hateful breath.                                      120

Yea, yea, it is no matter,
Dispraise them how you wille:
But zure they did much goodnesse;
Would they were with us stille!
We had our holy water,                                             125
And holy bread likewise,
And many holy reliques

And all this while they fed you
With vain and empty showe,                                       130
Which never Christ commanded,
As learned doctors knowe:
Search then the holy scriptures,
And thou shalt plainly see
That headlong to damnation                                         135
They alway trained thee.


Ignorance.



If it be true, good vellowe,
As thou dost zay to mee,
Unto my heavenly fader
Alone then will I flee:                                          140
Believing in the Gospel,
And passion of his zon,
And with the zubtil papistes
Ich have for ever done.

III.

THE WANDERING JEW.



  

The story of the Wandering Jew is of considerable antiquity:
it had obtained full credit in this part of the
world before the year 1228, as we learn from Mat.
Paris. For in that year, it seems, there came an Armenian
archbishop into England, to visit the shrines and reliques
preserved in our churches; who, being entertained at the monastery
of St. Albans, was asked several questions relating to his country,
&amp;c. Among the rest a monk, who sat near him, inquired, "if he
had ever seen or heard of the famous person named Joseph, that
was so much talked of; who was present at our Lord's crucifixion
and conversed with him, and who was still alive in confirmation of
the Christian faith." The archbishop answered, That the fact was
true. And afterwards one of his train, who was well known to a
servant of the abbot's, interpreting his master's words, told them
in French, "That his lord knew the person they spoke of very
well: that he had dined at his table but a little while before he
left the East: that he had been Pontius Pilate's porter, by name
Cartaphilus; who, when they were dragging Jesus out of the door
of the Judgment-hall, struck him with his fist on the back, saying,
'Go faster, Jesus, go faster: why dost thou linger?' Upon which
Jesus looked at him with a frown and said, 'I indeed am going, but
thou shall tarry till I come.' Soon after he was converted, and baptized
by the name of Joseph. He lives for ever, but at the end of
every hundred years falls into an incurable illness, and at length into
a fit or ecstacy, out of which when he recovers, he returns to the
same state of youth he was in when Jesus suffered, being then
about thirty years of age. He remembers all the circumstances
of the death and resurrection of Christ, the saints that arose with
him, the composing of the apostles' creed, their preaching, and dispersion;
and is himself a very grave and holy person." This is the
substance of Matthew Paris's account, who was himself a monk of
St. Albans, and was living at the time when this Armenian archbishop
made the above relation.

Since his time several impostors have appeared at intervals
under the name and character of the Wandering Jew; whose
several histories may be seen in Calmet's Dictionary of the Bible.
See also the Turkish Spy, vol. ii. book 3, let. 1. The story that is
copied in the following ballad is of one, who appeared at Hamburgh
in 1547, and pretended he had been a Jewish shoemaker at[Pg 294]
the time of Christ's crucifixion.&mdash;The ballad however seems to
be of later date. It is preserved in black-letter in the Pepys collection.





[This wondrous myth has found its way into many literatures,
and numerous theories have been brought forward to account for
its universality; but the only foundation for it appears to be in
Christ's words&mdash;"tarry till I come." Mons. Paul Lacroix, however,
suggests that it took its rise in a grand and beautiful allegory
in which the Hebrew race were personified under the figure of
the Everlasting Wanderer. Professor Child makes the following
pertinent remark in his English and Scottish Ballads (vol. viii.
p. 78). "It will be noticed that in the second form of the legend,
the punishment of perpetual existence, which gives rise to the old
names, Jud&aelig;us non mortalis, Ewiger Jude, is aggravated by a condemnation
to incessant change of place, which is indicated by
a corresponding name, Wandering Jew, Juif Errant, &amp;c."

In the Middle Ages it was supposed by some that Cain was the
Wandering Jew, but the Mahometan belief was fixed upon Samiri,
who, during the absence of Moses, enticed the people to worship
the golden calf. In G. Weil's The Bible, the Koran, and the Talmud,
1846 (p. 127), we read, "Moses then summoned Samiri, and
would have put him to death instantly, but Allah directed that he
should be sent into banishment. Ever since that time he roams
like a wild beast throughout the world; everyone shuns him and
purifies the ground on which his feet have stood; and he himself,
whenever he approaches men, exclaims, 'Touch me not.'" (Quoted
in Buckle's Common Place Book. Works, vol. ii. p. 502, 1872.)

The legend has been localized in various parts of the world and
connected with other myths. According to Mr. Baring Gould, a
similar curse to that under which the Wandering Jew is living is
supposed to have been inflicted upon the gipsies, on account of
their refusal to shelter the Virgin and Child in the flight into
Egypt.

The last recorded appearance of the Wandering Jew was at
Brussels in April, 1774, and the wanderer's name was Isaac
Laquedem. The name of the Hamburgh impostor, mentioned
above by Percy, was Ahasuerus.]

[Pg 295]




  



When as in faire Jerusalem
Our Saviour Christ did live,
And for the sins of all the worlde
His own deare life did give;
The wicked Jewes with scoffes and scornes                            5
Did dailye him molest,
That never till he left his life,
Our Saviour could not rest.

When they had crown'd his head with thornes,
And scourg'd him to disgrace,                                     10
In scornfull sort they led him forthe
Unto his dying place;
Where thousand thousands in the streete
Beheld him passe along,
Yet not one gentle heart was there,                                 15
That pityed this his wrong.

Both old and young reviled him,
As in the streete he wente,
And nought he found but churlish tauntes,
By every ones consente:                                           20
His owne deare crosse he bore himselfe,
A burthen far too great,
Which made him in the street to fainte,
With blood and water sweat.

Being weary thus, he sought for rest,                               25
To ease his burthened soule,
Upon a stone; the which a wretch
Did churlishly controule;
And sayd, Awaye, thou king of Jewes,
Thou shalt not rest thee here;                                    30
Pass on; thy execution place
Thou seest nowe draweth neare.[Pg 296]

And thereupon he thrust him thence;
At which our Saviour sayd,
I sure will rest, but thou shalt walke,                             35
And have no journey stayed.
With that this cursed shoemaker,
For offering Christ this wrong,
Left wife and children, house and all,
And went from thence along.                                       40

Where after he had seene the bloude
Of Jesus Christ thus shed,
And to the crosse his bodye nail'd,
Awaye with speed he fled
Without returning backe againe                                      45
Unto his dwelling place,
And wandred up and downe the worlde,
A runnagate most base.

No resting could he finde at all,
No ease, nor hearts content;                                      50
No house, nor home, nor biding place:
But wandring forth he went
From towne to towne in foreigne landes,
With grieved conscience still,
Repenting for the heinous guilt                                     55
Of his fore-passed ill.

Thus after some fewe ages past
In wandring up and downe;
He much again desired to see
Jerusalems renowne,                                               60
But finding it all quite destroyd,
He wandred thence with woe,
Our Saviours wordes, which he had spoke,
To verifie and showe.

"I'll rest, sayd hee, but thou shalt walke,"                        65
So doth this wandring Jew[Pg 297]
From place to place, but cannot rest
For seeing countries newe;
Declaring still the power of him,
Whereas he comes or goes,                                         70
And of all things done in the east,
Since Christ his death, he showes.

The world he hath still compast round
And seene those nations strange,
That hearing of the name of Christ,                                 75
Their idol gods doe change:
To whom he hath told wondrous thinges
Of time forepast, and gone,
And to the princes of the worlde
Declares his cause of moane:                                      80

Desiring still to be dissolv'd,
And yeild his mortal breath;
But, if the Lord hath thus decreed,
He shall not yet see death.
For neither lookes he old nor young,                                85
But as he did those times,
When Christ did suffer on the crosse
For mortall sinners crimes.

He hath past through many a foreigne place,
Arabia, Egypt, Africa,                                            90
Grecia, Syria, and great Thrace,
And throughout all Hungaria.
Where Paul and Peter preached Christ,
Those blest apostles deare;
There he hath told our Saviours wordes,                             95
In countries far, and neare.

And lately in Bohemia,
With many a German towne;
And now in Flanders, as tis thought,
He wandreth up and downe:                                        100[Pg 298]
Where learned men with him conferre
Of those his lingering dayes,
And wonder much to heare him tell
His journeyes, and his wayes.

If people give this Jew an almes,                                  105
The most that he will take
Is not above a groat a time:
Which he, for Jesus' sake,
Will kindlye give unto the poore,
And thereof make no spare,                                       110
Affirming still that Jesus Christ
Of him hath dailye care.

He ne'er was seene to laugh nor smile,
But weepe and make great moane;
Lamenting still his miseries,                                      115
And dayes forepast and gone:
If he heare any one blaspheme,
Or take God's name in vaine,
He telles them that they crucifie
Their Saviour Christe againe.                                    120

If you had seene his death, saith he,
As these mine eyes have done,
Ten thousand thousand times would yee
His torments think upon:
And suffer for his sake all paine                                  125
Of torments, and all woes.
These are his wordes and eke his life
Whereas he comes or goes.

IV.

THE LYE,


By Sir Walter Raleigh,



  

Is found in a very scarce miscellany intitled "Davison's
Poems, or a poeticall Rapsodie divided into sixe books....
The 4th impression newly corrected and augmented,
and put into a forme more pleasing to the reader.
Lond. 1621, 12mo." This poem is reported to have been written
by its celebrated author the night before his execution, Oct. 29,
1618. But this must be a mistake, for there were at least two
editions of Davison's poems before that time, one in 1608,[817] the
other in 1611.[818] So that unless this poem was an after-insertion in
the 4th edit. it must have been written long before the death of
Sir Walter: perhaps it was composed soon after his condemnation
in 1603. See Oldys's Life of Sir W. Raleigh, p. 173, fol.





[Hallam asserted that this favourite poem had been ascribed
to Raleigh without evidence and without probability. Ritson
affirmed that F. Davison was the author, and Ellis supported the
claims of Joshua Sylvester, but Dr. Hannah has proved conclusively
that it was really written by Raleigh. It was certainly composed
before 1608, and probably about the period of its author's marriage
and his consequent imprisonment in the Tower. Dr. Hannah
has brought together a large amount of illustrative evidence in his
interesting edition of the Courtly Poets (1872), and he shows that
the answerers of the poem attributed it to Raleigh. One of the
answers commences as follows&mdash;


"Go, echo of the mind, a careless truth protest;
Make answer that rude Rawly no stomach can digest."




He also draws attention to a transcript of the poem among the
Chetham MSS., made not long after Raleigh's death, and signed
"Wa. Raleigh."

In that remarkable book, Sylvester's Remains, printed at the end
of the translation of Du Bartas, 1641, The Soules Errand is inserted
with some poor additional verses.]

[Pg 300]




  



Goe, soule, the bodies guest,
Upon a thankelesse arrant;
Feare not to touche the best,
The truth shall be thy warrant:
Goe, since I needs must dye,                                     5
And give the world the lye.

Goe tell the court, it glowes
And shines like rotten wood;
Goe tell the church it showes
What's good, and doth no good:                                    10
If church and court reply,
Then give them both the lye.

Tell potentates they live
Acting by others actions;
Not lov'd unlesse they give,                                        15
Not strong but by their factions;
If potentates reply,
Give potentates the lye.

Tell men of high condition,
That rule affairs of state,                                       20
Their purpose is ambition,
Their practise onely hate;
And if they once reply,
Then give them all the lye.

Tell them that brave it most,                                       25
They beg for more by spending,
Who in their greatest cost
Seek nothing but commending;
And if they make reply,
Spare not to give the lye.                                      30[Pg 301]

Tell zeale, it lacks devotion;
Tell love it is but lust;
Tell time, it is but motion;
Tell flesh, it is but dust;
And wish them not reply,                                        35
For thou must give the lye.

Tell age, it daily wasteth;
Tell honour, how it alters;
Tell beauty, how she blasteth;
Tell favour, how she falters;                                     40
And as they shall reply,
Give each of them the lye.

Tell wit, how much it wrangles
In tickle points of nicenesse;
Tell wisedome, she entangles                                        45
Herselfe in over-wisenesse;
And if they do reply,
Straight give them both the lye.

Tell physicke of her boldnesse;
Tell skill, it is pretension;                                     50
Tell charity of coldness;
Tell law, it is contention;
And as they yield reply,
So give them still the lye.

Tell fortune of her blindnesse;                                     55
Tell nature of decay;
Tell friendship of unkindnesse;
Tell justice of delay:
And if they dare reply,
Then give them all the lye.                                     60

Tell arts, they have no soundnesse,
But vary by esteeming;[Pg 302]
Tell schooles, they want profoundnesse,
And stand too much on seeming:
If arts and schooles reply,                                     65
Give arts and schooles the lye.

Tell faith, it's fled the citie;
Tell how the countrey erreth;
Tell, manhood shakes off pitie;
Tell, vertue least preferreth:                                    70
And, if they doe reply,
Spare not to give the lye.

So, when thou hast, as I
Commanded thee, done blabbing,
Although to give the lye                                            75
Deserves no less than stabbing,
Yet stab at thee who will,
No stab the soule can kill.

VERSES BY KING JAMES I.



  

In the first edition of this book were inserted, by way of
specimen of his majesty's poetic talents, some Punning
Verses made on the disputations at Sterling: but it
having been suggested to the Editor, that the king only
gave the quibbling commendations in prose, and that some obsequious
court-rhymer put them into metre;[819] it was thought
proper to exchange them for two Sonnets of K. James's own
composition. James was a great versifier, and therefore out of
the multitude of his poems we have here selected two, which (to
shew our impartiality) are written in his best and his worst manner.
The first would not dishonour any writer of that time; the
second is a most complete example of the Bathos.
[Pg 303]




[James I. commenced the practice of poetry at an early age,
and his first book was printed at Edinburgh by T. Vautroullier, in
1584, under the title of The Essays of a Prentise in the divine art
of Poesie. The king's next poetical venture was entitled, His
Majesty's Poeticall Exercises at Vacant Houres. Printed at Edinburgh,
by Robert Waldegrave, printer to the King's Majesty in
1591.]



A Sonnet addressed by King James to his
son Prince Henry.

From K. James's works in folio: Where is also printed another
called his Majesty's OWN Sonnet; it would perhaps be too cruel to
infer from thence that this was not his Majesty's own Sonnet.




  



God gives not kings the stile of Gods in vaine,
For on his throne his scepter do they swey:
And as their subjects ought them to obey,
So kings should feare and serve their God againe.

If then ye would enjoy a happie reigne,
Observe the statutes of our heavenly king;
And from his law make all your laws to spring;
Since his lieutenant here ye should remaine.

Rewarde the just, be stedfast, true and plaine;
Represse the proud, maintayning aye the right;
Walke always so, as ever in HIS sight,
Who guardes the godly, plaguing the prophane.
And so ye shall in princely vertues shine,
Resembling right your mightie king divine.

[Pg 304]



A Sonnet occasioned by the bad Weather
which hindred the Sports at Newmarket
in January 1616.

This is printed from Drummond of Hawthornden's works, folio:
where also may be seen some verses of Lord Stirling's upon this
Sonnet, which concludes with the finest Anticlimax I remember
to have seen.




  



How cruelly these catives do conspire?
What loathsome love breeds such a baleful band
Betwixt the cankred king of Creta land,[820]
That melancholy old and angry sire,

And him, who wont to quench debate and ire                           5
Among the Romans, when his ports were clos'd?[821]
But now his double face is still dispos'd,
With Saturn's help, to freeze us at the fire.

The earth ore-covered with a sheet of snow,
Refuses food to fowl, to bird, and beast:                           10
The chilling cold lets every thing to grow,
And surfeits cattle with a starving feast.
Curs'd be that love and mought[822] continue short,
Which kills all creatures, and doth spoil our sport.

VI.

K. JOHN AND THE ABBOT OF
CANTERBURY.



  

The common popular ballad of King John and the Abbot
seems to have been abridged and modernized about the
time of James I. from one much older, intitled, King
John and the Bishop of Canterbury. The Editor's folio
MS. contains a copy of this last, but in too corrupt a state to be
reprinted; it however afforded many lines worth reviving, which
will be found inserted in the ensuing stanzas.

The archness of the following questions and answers hath been
much admired by our old ballad-makers; for besides the two copies
above mentioned, there is extant another ballad on the same subject
(but of no great antiquity or merit), intitled, King Olfrey and
the Abbot.[823] Lastly, about the time of the civil wars, when the cry
ran against the Bishops, some Puritan worked up the same story
into a very doleful ditty, to a solemn tune, concerning King Henry
and a Bishop, with this stinging moral:


"Unlearned men hard matters out can find,
When learned bishops princes eyes do blind."






[All the copies of this ballad are of late date, but Mr. Chappell
says that the story upon which it is founded can be traced back to
the fifteenth century, and Dr. Rimbault so traces it to the Adventures
of Howleglas, printed in the Lower Saxon dialect in 1483. Wynkyn
de Worde printed in 1511 a collection of riddles translated from
the French, with the title Demaundes Joyous, which are like those
propounded by King John to the Abbot. Prof. Child points out
that by this link the ballad is connected with a tolerably large
literature of wit combats of the middle ages. (See English and
Scottish Ballads, vol. viii. p. 3.)

Copies of the puritan ballad referred to above are in the Pepys,
Douce, and Roxburghe collections. It commences as follows&mdash;
[Pg 306]

"In Popish times, when bishops proud
In England did bear sway,
Their lordships did like princes live,
And kept all at obey."




The ballad entitled King John and Bishoppe, in the folio MS. to
which Percy refers, is printed at the end of the following ballad.]



The following is chiefly printed from an ancient black-letter copy, to
"The tune of Derry down."


  



An ancient story Ile tell you anon
Of a notable prince, that was called king John;
And he ruled England with maine and with might,
For he did great wrong, and maintein'd little right.

And Ile tell you a story, a story so merrye,                         5
Concerning the Abbot of Canterb&ugrave;rye;
How for his house-keeping, and high renowne,
They rode poste for him to fair London towne.

An hundred men, the king did heare say,
The abbot kept in his house every day;                              10
And fifty golde chaynes, without any doubt,
In velvet coates waited the abbot about.

How now, father abbot, I heare it of thee,
Thou keepest a farre better house than mee,
And for thy house-keeping and high renowne,                         15
I feare thou work'st treason against my crown.

My liege, quo' the abbot, I would it were knowne,
I never spend nothing, but what is my owne;
And I trust, your grace will doe me no deere,[824]
For spending of my owne true-gotten geere.                          20
[Pg 307]
Yes, yes, father abbot, thy fault it is highe,
And now for the same thou needest must dye;
For except thou canst answer me questions three,
Thy head shall be smitten from thy bod&igrave;e.

And first, quo' the king, when I'm in this stead,                   25
With my crowne of golde so faire on my head,
Among all my liege-men so noble of birthe,
Thou must tell me to one penny what I am worthe.

Secondlye, tell me, without any doubt,
How soone I may ride the whole worlde about.                        30
And at the third question thou must not shrink,
But tell me here truly what I do think.

O, these are hard questions for my shallow witt,
Nor I c&aacute;nnot answer your grace as yet:
But if you will give me but three weekes space,                     35
Ile do my endeavour to answer your grace.

Now three weeks space to thee will I give,
And that is the longest time thou hast to live;
For if thou dost not answer my questions three,
Thy lands and thy livings are forfeit to mee.                       40

Away rode the abbot all sad at that word,
And he rode to Cambridge, and Oxenford;
But never a doctor there was so wise,
That could with his learning an answer devise.

Then home rode the abbot of comfort so cold,                        45
And he mett his shepheard a going to fold:
How now, my lord abbot, you are welcome home;
What newes do you bring us from good king John?

"Sad newes, sad newes, shepheard, I must give;
That I have but three days more to live:                            50
For if I do not answer him questions three,
My head will be smitten from my bod&igrave;e.[Pg 308]

The first is to tell him there in that stead,
With his crowne of golde so fair on his head,
Among all his liege men so noble of birth,                          55
To within one penny of what he is worth.

The seconde, to tell him, without any doubt,
How soone he may ride this whole world about:
And at the third question I must not shrinke,
But tell him there truly what he does thinke."                      60

Now cheare up, sire abbot, did you never hear yet,
That a fool he may learn a wise man witt?
Lend me horse, and serving men, and your apparel,
And I'll ride to London to answere your quarrel.

Nay frowne not, if it hath bin told unto mee,                       65
I am like your lordship, as ever may bee:
And if you will but lend me your gowne,
There is none shall knowe us at fair London towne.

"Now horses, and serving-men thou shalt have,
With sumptuous array most gallant and brave;                        70
With crozier, and miter, and rochet, and cope,
Fit to appeare 'fore our fader the pope."

Now welcome, sire abbot, the king he did say,
Tis well thou'rt come back to keepe thy day;
For and if thou canst answer my questions three,                    75
Thy life and thy living both saved shall bee.

And first, when thou seest me here in this stead.
With my crown of golde so fair on my head,
Among all my liege-men so noble of birthe,
Tell me to one penny what I am worth.                               80

"For thirty pence our Saviour was sold
Amonge the false Jewes, as I have bin told;
And twenty nine is the worth of thee,
For I thinke, thou art one penny worser than hee."[Pg 309]

The king he laughed, and swore by St. Bittel[825],                  85
I did not think I had been worth so littel!
&mdash;Now secondly tell me, without any doubt,
How soone I may ride this whole world about.

"You must rise with the sun, and ride with the same,
Until the next morning he riseth againe;                            90
And then your grace need not make any doubt,
But in twenty-four hours you'll ride it about."

The king he laughed, and swore by St. Jone,
I did not think, it could be gone so soone!
&mdash;Now from the third question thou must not shrinke,
But tell me here truly what I do thinke.                            96

"Yea, that shall I do, and make your grace merry:
You thinke I'm the abbot of Canterb&ugrave;ry;
But I'm his poor shepheard, as plain you may see,
That am come to beg pardon for him and for mee."

The king he laughed, and swore by the masse,                       101
Ile make thee lord abbot this day in his place!
"Now naye, my liege, be not in such speede,
For alacke I can neither write, ne reade."

Four nobles a weeke, then I will give thee,                        105
For this merry jest thou hast showne unto mee;
And tell the old abbot when thou comest home,
Thou hast brought him a pardon from good king John.

[The following version is reprinted from Hales and Furnivall's
edition of the Percy Folio, vol. i. p. 508.


Off an ancient story Ile tell you anon,
of a notable prince that was called King Iohn,
in England was borne, with maine and with might
hee did much wrong, and mainteined litle right.                      4

this noble prince was vexed in veretye,
for he was angry with the bishopp of canterbury
ffor his house-keeping and his good cheere,
th&eacute; rode post for him, as you shall heare;                           8

they rode post for him very hastilye;
the King sayd the bishopp kept a better house then hee;
a 100 men euen, as I say,
the Bishopp kept in his house euerye day,                           12

and 50 gold chaines without any doubt,
in veluett coates waited the Bishopp about.
the Bishopp, he came to the court anon
before his prince that was called King Iohn.                        16

as soone as the Bishopp the King did see,
"O," quoth the King, "Bishopp, thou art welcome to mee!
there is noe man soe welcome to towne
as thou that workes treason against my crowne."                     20

"My leege," quoth the Bishopp, "I wold it were knowne;
I spend, your grace, nothing but that thats my owne;
I trust your grace will doe me noe deare
for spending my owne trew gotten geere."                            24

"Yes," quoth the King, "Bishopp, thou must needs dye:
eccept thou can answere mee questions 3,
thy head shalbe smitten quite from thy bodye,
and all thy liuing remayne vnto mee.                                28

"first," quoth the King, "tell me in this steade,
with this crowne of gold heere vpon my head,
amongst my Nobilitye with Ioy and much Mirth,
lett me know within one pennye what I am worth:                     32

Secondlye, tell me without any dowbt
how soone I may goe the whole world about:[Pg 311]

and thirdly, tell mee or euer I stinte,
what is the thing, Bishopp, that I doe thinke.                      36
20 dayes pardon thoust haue trulye,
and come againe and answere mee."

the Bishopp bade the King 'god night' att a word.
he rode betwixt Cambridge and Oxenford,                             40
but neuer a Doctor there was soe wise
cold shew him these questions or enterprise;

wherewith the Bishopp was nothing gladd,
but in his hart was heauy and sadd,                                 44
and hyed him home to a house in the countrye
To ease some part of his Melanchollye.

h&iacute;s halfe brother dwelt there, was feirce &amp; fell,
noe better but a shepard to the Bishoppe him-sell;                  48
the shepard came to the Bishopp anon,
saying, "my Lord, you are welcome home!

what ayles you," quoth the shepard, "that you are soe sadd,
and had wonte to haue beene soe merry &amp; gladd?"                     52
"Nothing," quoth the Bishopp, "I ayle att this time,
will not thee availe to know, Brother mine."

"Brother," quoth the Shepeard, "you haue heard itt,
that a ffoole may teach a wisemane witt;                            56
say me therfore what-soeuer you will,
and if I doe you noe good, Ile doe you noe ill."

Quoth the Bishop: "I have beene att thy court anon,
before my prince is called King Iohn,                               60
and there he hath charged mee
against his crowne with traitorye;

if I cannot answer his misterye,
3 questions hee hath propounded to mee,                             64
he will haue my Land soe faire and free,
and alsoe the head from my bodye.

the first question was, 'to tell him in that stead
with the crowne of gold vpon his head,                              68
amongst his nobilitye with Ioy &amp; much mirth,
to lett him know within one penye what hee is worth;'

and secondlye 'to tell him with-out any doubt
how soone he may goe the whole world about;'                        72
and thirdlye, 'to tell him, or ere I stint,
what is the thing that he does thinke.'"[Pg 312]

"Brother," quoth the shepard, "you are a man of Learninge;
what neede you stand in doubt of soe small a thinge?                76
lend me," quoth the shepard, "your ministers apparrell,
Ile ryde to the court and answere your quarrell;

lend me your serving men, say me not nay;
with all your best horsses that ryd on the way,                     80
Ile to the court, this matter to stay;
Ile speake with King Iohn &amp; heare what heele say."

the Bishopp with speed prepared then
to sett forth the shepard with horsse and man;                      84
the shepard was liuely with-out any doubt;
I wott a royall companye came to the court.

the shepard hee came to the court anon
before (his) prince that was called King Iohn.                      88
as soone as the king the shepard did see,
"O," quoth the king, "Bishopp, thou art welcome to me!"

the shepard was soe like the Bishopp his brother,
the King cold not know the one from the other.                      92
Quoth the King, "Bishopp, thou art welcome to me
if thou can answer me my questions 3!"

said the shepeard, "if it please your grace,
show mee what the first quest&iota;on was."                            96
"first" quoth the king, "tell mee in this stead
with the crowne of gold vpon my head,

amongst my nobilitye with Ioy and much mirth,
within one pennye what I am worth."                                100
Quoth the shepard, "to make your grace noe offence,
I thinke you are worth 29 pence;

for our Lord Iesus, that bought vs all,
for 30 pence was sold into thrall                                  104
amongst the cursed Iewes, as I to you doe showe;
but I know christ was one penye better then you."

then the King laught, and swore by St Andrew
he was not thought to bee of such a small value.                   108
"Secondlye, tell mee with-out any doubt
how soone I may goe the world round about,"

saies the shepard, "it is noe time with your grace to scorne;
but rise betime with the sun in the morne,                         112
and follow his course till his vprising,
and then you may know with-out any Leasing&mdash;[Pg 313]

and this your grace shall proue the same&mdash;
you are come to the same place from whence you came;               116
24 houres, with-out any doubt,
your grace may the world goe round about;

the world round about, euen as I doe say,
if with the sun you can goe the next way."                         120
"and thirdlye tell me or euer I stint,
what is the thing, Bishoppe, that I doe thinke."

"that shall I doe," quoth the shepeard, "for veretye
you thinke I am the Bishopp of Canterburye,"                       124
"why? art not thou? the truth tell to me;
for I doe thinke soe," quoth the king, "by St. Marye."

"not soe," quoth the shepeard; "the truth shalbe knowne,
I am his poore shepeard; my brother is att home."                  128
"why," quoth the King, "if itt soe bee,
Ile make thee Bishopp here to mee."

"Noe Sir" quoth the shepard, "I pray you be still,
for Ile not bee Bishop but against my will;                        132
for I am not fitt for any such deede,
for I can neither write nor reede."

"why then," quoth the king, "Ile giue thee cleere
a patten of 300 pound a yeere;                                     136
that I will giue thee franke and free;
take thee that, shepard, for coming to me:

free pardon Ile giue," the kings grace said,
"to saue the Bishopp, his land and his head;                       140
with him nor thee Ile be nothing wrath;
here is the pardon for him and thee both."

then the shepard he had noe more to say,
but tooke the pardon and rode his way.                             144
when he came to the Bishopps place,
the Bishopp asket anon how all things was:

"Brother," quoth the Shepard, "I haue well sped,
for I haue saued both your Land &amp; your head;                       148
the King with you is nothing wrath,
for heere is the pardon for you and mee both."

then the Bishopes hart was of a merry cheere,
"brother, thy paines Ile quitt them cleare,                        152
for I will giue thee a patent to thee &amp; to thine
of 50li. a yeere land good and fine."[Pg 314]

"I will to thee noe longer croche nor creepe,
nor Ile serue thee noe more to keepe thy sheepe."                  156
whereeuer wist you shepard before,
that had in his head witt such store

to pleasure a Bishopp in such a like case,
to answer 3 questions to the Kings grace?                          160
whereeuer wist you shepard gett cleare
350li. pound a yeere?

I neuer hard of his fellow before,
nor I neuer shall, now I need to say noe more:                     164
I neuer knew shepeard that gott such a liuinge
But David the shepeard that was a King.

VII.

YOU MEANER BEAUTIES.



  

This little Sonnet was written by Sir Henry Wotton,
Knight, on that amiable Princess, Elizabeth daughter
of James I. and wife of the Elector Palatine, who
was chosen King of Bohemia, Sept. 5, 1619. The
consequences of this fatal election are well known: Sir Henry
Wotton, who in that and the following year was employed in
several embassies in Germany on behalf of this unfortunate lady,
seems to have had an uncommon attachment to her merit and
fortunes, for he gave away a jewel worth a thousand pounds, that
was presented to him by the Emperor, "because it came from an
enemy to his royal mistress the Queen of Bohemia." See Biog.
Britan.

This song is printed from the Reliqui&aelig; Wottonian&aelig;, 1651, with
some corrections from an old MS. copy.





[This elegant little poem in praise of the Queen of Bohemia
(who was called by those who knew her and were won by her
sweetness, spirit, wit, and unselfishness&mdash;the Queen of Hearts) has
been very frequently reprinted. The unfortunate princess was
also named the Snow Queen and her husband the Winter King,
in allusion to the fact that their reign at Prague only lasted one
winter. The poem first appeared, according to Dr. Rimbault, in
"The Sixt Set of Bookes, wherein are Anthemes for Versus and[Pg 315]
Chorus of 5 and 6 Parts; apt for Violls and Voyces: newly composed
by Michaell Est, Bachelor of Musicke, and Master of the
Choristers of the Cathedrall Church in Litchfield," London, 1624,
4to. It is printed in Wit's Recreations, 1640, and Wit's Interpreter,
1671, and in "Songs and Fancies to severall Musicall parts,
both apt for Voices and Viols," Aberdeen, 1682. Alterations
were made in the various copies, and in the latter book a wretched
second part, quite out of harmony with the original, was added.
It has found its way, with some variations, among Montrose's poems
(see Napier's Life of Montrose, 1856, Appendix, p. xl.), and Robert
Chambers (ignorant of the Englishman Sir Henry Wotton's claim
to the authorship) actually printed it in his Scottish Songs (vol. ii.
p. 631) as if "written by Darnley in praise of the beauty of Queen
Mary before their marriage."

Percy, while copying from the Reliqui&aelig; Wottonian&aelig;, 1651,
transposed stanzas 2 and 3. In Abp. Sancroft's MS. (Tanner, 465,
fol. 43) the following verses occur as stanzas 4 and 6 of the whole
poem:&mdash;


"You rubies, that do gems adorn,
And sapphires with your azure hue
Like to the skies, or blushing morn,
How pale's your brightness in our view
When diamonds are mixed with you.

"The rose, the violet, all the spring
Unto her breath, for sweetness run;
The diamond's dark'ned in the ring
If she appear, the moon's undone,
As in the presence of the Sun."]





  



You meaner beauties of the night,
That poorly satisfie our eies
More by your number, than your light;
You common people of the skies,
What are you when the Moon shall rise?                               5

Ye violets that first appeare,
By your pure purple mantles known
Like the proud virgins of the yeare,
As if the Spring were all your own;
What are you when the Rose is blown?                              10[Pg 316]

Ye curious chaunters of the wood,
That warble forth dame Nature's layes,
Thinking your passions understood
By your weak accents: what's your praise,
When Philomell her voyce shall raise?                             15

So when my mistris shal be seene
In sweetnesse of her looks and minde;
By virtue first, then choyce a queen;
Tell me, if she was not design'd
Th' eclypse and glory of her kind?                                20





VIII.

THE OLD AND YOUNG COURTIER.



  

This excellent old song, the subject of which is a comparison
between the manners of the old gentry, as still
subsisting in the times of Elizabeth, and the modern
refinements affected by their sons in the reigns of her
successors, is given, with corrections, from an ancient black-letter
copy in the Pepys collection, compared with another printed among
some miscellaneous "poems and songs" in a book intitled, Le
Prince d'amour, or The Prince of Love, 1660, 8vo.





[This was one of the most popular of old songs, and Dr. King
in his Preface to the Art of Cookery places it by the side of Chevy
Chase as one of the ballads to be hung up over the carved mantelpiece
in the homes of old British hospitality. It is to be found in
broadside in nearly all the collections, and appears to have been
printed for the first time in the reign of James I. by T. Symcocke.
Pepys notices it in his Diary under the date 16th June, 1668&mdash;"Come
to Newbery, and there dined&mdash;and musick: a song of the
old Courtier of Queen Elizabeth's, and how he was changed upon
the coming in of the King, did please me mightily, and I did cause
W. Hewer to write it out."

The song was parodied and altered into many forms. About
the middle of the last century it was revived and sung by Mr.
Vernon in Shadwell's comedy, The Squire of Alsatia, with a new[Pg 317]
burden, "moderation and alteration," and finally it has been again
revived in the present century, with still greater alterations, under
the title of The Old English Gentleman.

Mr. Chappell has the following note on the object of the song:&mdash;"Southey
remarks very justly on the complaints of the decay of
hospitality, that 'while rents were received in kind they must
have been chiefly consumed in kind; at least there could be no
accumulation of disposable wealth.' He supposes this mode of
payment to have fallen generally into disuse during the reign of
James I. Without doubt, many of the poor would feel the
change." Popular Music of the Olden Time, vol. ii. p. 778.]




  



An old song made by an aged old pate,
Of an old worshipful gentleman, who had a greate estate,
That kept a brave old house at a bountiful rate,
And an old porter to relieve the poor at his gate;
Like an old courtier of the queen's,
And the queen's old courtier.

With an old lady, whose anger one word asswages;
They every quarter paid their old servants their wages,
And never knew what belong'd to coachmen, footmen, nor pages,
But kept twenty old fellows with blue coats and badges;
Like an old courtier, &amp;c.

With an old study fill'd full of learned old books,
With an old reverend chaplain, you might know him by his looks.
With an old buttery hatch worn quite off the hooks,
And an old kitchen, that maintain'd half a dozen old cooks:
Like an old courtier, &amp;c.[Pg 318]

With an old hall, hung about with pikes, guns, and bows,
With old swords, and bucklers, that had borne many shrewde blows,
And an old frize coat, to cover his worship's trunk hose,
And a cup of old sherry, to comfort his copper nose;
Like an old courtier, &amp;c.

With a good old fashion, when Christmasse was come,
To call in all his old neighbours with bagpipe and drum,
With good chear enough to furnish every old room,
And old liquor able to make a cat speak, and man dumb,
Like an old courtier, &amp;c.

With an old falconer, huntsman, and a kennel of hounds,
That never hawked, nor hunted, but in his own grounds,
Who, like a wise man, kept himself within his own bounds,
And when he dyed gave every child a thousand good pounds;
Like an old courtier, &amp;c.

But to his eldest son his house and land he assign'd,
Charging him in his will to keep the old bountifull mind,
To be good to his old tenants, and to his neighbours be kind:
But in the ensuing ditty you shall hear how he was inclin'd;
Like a young courtier of the king's,
And the king's young courtier.[Pg 319]

Like a flourishing young gallant, newly come to his land,
Who keeps a brace of painted madams at his command,
And takes up a thousand pound upon his father's land,
And gets drunk in a tavern, till he can neither go nor stand;
Like a young courtier, &amp;c.

With a new-fangled lady, that is dainty, nice, and spare,
Who never knew what belong'd to good house-keeping, or care,
Who buyes gaudy-color'd fans to play with wanton air,
And seven or eight different dressings of other womens hair;
Like a young courtier, &amp;c.

With a new-fashion'd hall, built where the old one stood,
Hung round with new pictures, that do the poor no good,
With a fine marble chimney, wherein burns neither coal nor wood,
And a new smooth shovelboard, whereon no victuals ne'er stood;
Like a young courtier, &amp;c.

With a new study, stuft full of pamphlets, and plays,
And a new chaplain, that swears faster than he prays,
With a new buttery hatch, that opens once in four or five days,
And a new French cook, to devise fine kickshaws, and toys;
Like a young courtier, &amp;c.

With a new fashion, when Christmas is drawing on,
On a new journey to London straight we all must begone,[Pg 320]
And leave none to keep house, but our new porter John,
Who relieves the poor with a thump on the back with a stone;
Like a young courtier, &amp;c.

With a new gentleman-usher, whose carriage is compleat,
With a new coachman, footmen, and pages to carry up the meat,
With a waiting-gentlewoman, whose dressing is very neat,
Who when her lady has din'd, lets the servants not eat;
Like a young courtier, &amp;c.

With new titles of honour bought with his father's old gold,
For which sundry of his ancestors old manors are sold;
And this is the course most of our new gallants hold,
Which makes that good house-keeping is now grown so cold,
Among the young courtiers of the king,
Or the king's young courtiers.

IX.

SIR JOHN SUCKLING'S CAMPAIGNE.



  

When the Scottish covenanters rose up in arms, and
advanced to the English borders in 1639, many of
the courtiers complimented the king by raising forces
at their own expence. Among these none were more
distinguished than the gallant Sir John Suckling, who raised a
troop of horse, so richly accoutred, that it cost him &pound;12,000.
The like expensive equipment of other parts of the army, made[Pg 321]
the king remark, that "the Scots would fight stoutly, if it were but
for the Englishmen's fine cloaths." (Lloyd's Memoirs.) When
they came to action, the rugged Scots proved more than a match
for the fine shewy English: many of whom behaved remarkably
ill, and among the rest this splendid troop of Sir John Suckling's.

This humorous pasquil has been generally supposed to have
been written by Sir John, as a banter upon himself. Some of his
contemporaries however attributed it to Sir John Mennis, a wit of
those times, among whose poems it is printed in a small poetical
miscellany, intitled, Musarum delici&aelig;: or the Muses recreation,
containing several pieces of poetique wit, 2d edition.&mdash;By Sir J. M.
(Sir John Mennis) and Ja. S. (James Smith.) Lond. 1656, 12mo.&mdash;(See
Wood's Athen&aelig;. ii. 397, 418.) In that copy is subjoined an
additional stanza, which probably was written by this Sir John
Mennis, viz.:&mdash;


"But now there is peace, he's return'd to increase
His money, which lately he spent-a,
But his lost honour must lye still in the dust;
At Barwick away it went-a."






[This song is a parody of the famous old song, John Dory, commencing.&mdash;


"As it fell on a holiday
And upon a holytide-a
John Dory bought him an ambling nag
To Paris for to ride-a."




Suckling's satirical powers made him peculiarly odious to the
Parliamentarians, as they were turned against them, and consequently
Mennis's lampoon was a great favourite with the Roundheads.
In Le Prince d'Amour, 1660, there is a song Upon Sir
John Suckling's 100 Horse, and the following are two of the seven
stanzas of which it consists:&mdash;


"I tell thee, Jack, thou gav'st the king
So rare a present, that nothing
Could welcomer have been;
A hundred horse! beshrew my heart,
It was a brave heroic part,
The like will scarce be seen.

"For ev'ry horse shall have on's back
A man as valiant as Sir Jack,
Although not half so witty:
Yet I did hear the other day
Two tailors made seven run away
Good faith, the more's the pity."

[Pg 322]


The uniform adopted by Suckling for his troop consisted of a
white doublet, and scarlet coat and breeches, with a scarlet feather
in the bonnet. The men were vigorous, well mounted and armed,
and these famous 100 horsemen were considered to be the finest
sight in his majesty's army. Mr. W. C. Hazlitt points out that the
earliest news of them appears to be in a letter of Jan. 29, 1638-9,
from the Earl of Northumberland to Lord Conway, in which the
writer speaks of Suckling having then engaged himself to raise the
troop "within these three days." (Calendar of State Papers (Domestic,)
1638-9, p. 378.) The army was badly commanded, and no
greater disgrace attached to Suckling's troop than to the rest.]




  



Sir John he got him an ambling nag,
To Scotland for to ride-a,
With a hundred horse more, all his own he swore,
To guard him on every side-a.

No Errant-knight ever went to fight                                  5
With halfe so gay a bravada,
Had you seen but his look, you'ld have sworn on a book,
Hee'ld have conquer'd a whole armada.

The ladies ran all to the windows to see
So gallant and warlike a sight-a,                                 10
And as he pass'd by, they said with a sigh,
Sir John, why will you go fight-a?

But he, like a cruel knight, spurr'd on;
His heart would not relent-a,
For, till he came there, what had he to fear?                       15
Or why should he repent-a?

The king (God bless him!) had singular hopes
Of him and all his troop-a:
The borderers they, as they met him on the way,
For joy did hollow, and whoop-a.                                  20[Pg 323]

None lik'd him so well, as his own colonell,
Who took him for John de Wert-a;[826]
But when there were shows of gunning and blows,
My gallant was nothing so pert-a.

For when the Scots army came within sight,                          25
And all prepared to fight-a,
He ran to his tent, they ask'd what he meant,
He swore he must needs goe sh*te-a.

The colonell sent for him back agen,
To quarter him in the van-a,                                      30
But Sir John did swear, he would not come there,
To be kill'd the very first man-a.

To cure his fear, he was sent to the reare,
Some ten miles back, and more-a;
Where Sir John did play at trip and away,                           35
And ne'er saw the enemy more-a.


FOOTNOTES:



[826] Ver. 22. John de Wert was a German general of great reputation,
and the terror of the French in the reign of Louis XIII. Hence
his name became proverbial in France, where he was called De
Vert. See Bayle's Dict.





X.

TO ALTHEA FROM PRISON.



  

This excellent sonnet, which possessed a high degree of
fame among the old Cavaliers, was written by Colone,
Richard Lovelace during his confinement in the gatehouse,
Westminster: to which he was committed by the
House of Commons, in April 1642, for presenting a petition from
the county of Kent, requesting them to restore the king to his
rights, and to settle the government. See Wood's Athen&aelig;, vol. ii.
p. 228, and Lysons' Environs of London, vol. i. p. 109; where may
be seen at large the affecting story of this elegant writer, who after
[Pg 324]having been distinguished for every gallant and polite accomplishment,
the pattern of his own sex, and the darling of the ladies, died
in the lowest wretchedness, obscurity, and want, in 1658.

This song is printed from a scarce volume of his poems intitled,
Lucasta, 1649, 12mo. collated with a copy in the Editor's folio
MS.





[As Percy mentions, the folio MS. collations have been added
from it (ed. Hales and Furnivall, vol. ii. p. 17), but it will at once
be seen that they are of little value. The music to this most
exquisite of prison songs was composed by the celebrated Dr. John
Wilson, and first printed (according to Dr. Rimbault) in his Cheerful
Ayres or Ballads set for three Voices, Oxford, 1660.

Lucasta (= Lux casta, Lucy Sacheverell), misled by a report that
Lovelace had died of his wounds received at Dunkirk while commanding
a regiment of his own forming in the service of the
French king, married another lover.

Although doubtless Lovelace died in great trouble, we may
hope that Wood's account of his extreme poverty is exaggerated,
for his daughter and sole heir married the son of Lord Chief Justice
Coke, and brought to her husband the estates of her father at
Kingsdown in Kent.]




  



When love with unconfined wings
Hovers within my gates,
And my divine Althea brings
To whisper at my grates;
When I lye tangled in her haire,                                     5
And fetter'd with her eye,
The birds that wanton in the aire,
Know no such libertye.[827]

When flowing cups run swiftly round
With no allaying Thames,[828]                                     10
Our carelesse heads with roses crown'd,
Our hearts with loyal flames;
When thirsty griefe in wine we steepe,[829][Pg 325]
When healths and draughts goe free,[830]
Fishes, that tipple in the deepe,                                   15
Know no such libert&igrave;e.[827]

When, linnet-like, confined I
With shriller note shall sing
The mercye, sweetness, majestye,[831]
And glories of my king;[832]                                      20
When I shall voyce aloud how good
He is, how great should be,
Th' enlarged windes, that curle the flood,[833]
Know no such libert&igrave;e.[827]

Stone walls doe not a prison make,                                  25
Nor iron barres a cage,
Mindes, innocent, and quiet, take[834]
That for an hermitage:[835]
If I have freedom in my love,
And in my soule am free,                                          30
Angels alone, that soare above,[836]
Enjoy such libert&igrave;e.[837]

XI.

THE DOWNFALL OF CHARING-CROSS.



  

Charing-Cross, as it stood before the civil wars, was
one of those beautiful Gothic obelisks erected to conjugal
affection by Edward I., who built such a one
wherever the herse of his beloved Eleanor rested in
its way from Lincolnshire to Westminster. But neither its ornamental
situation, the beauty of its structure, nor the noble design
[Pg 326]of its erection (which did honour to humanity), could preserve it
from the merciless zeal of the times: For, in 1647, it was demolished
by order of the House of Commons, as popish and
superstitious. This occasioned the following not unhumorous
sarcasm, which has been often printed among the popular sonnets
of those times.

The plot referred to in ver. 17, was that entered into by Mr.
Waller the poet, and others, with a view to reduce the city and
tower to the service of the king; for which two of them, Nath.
Tomkins and Rich. Chaloner, suffered death July 5, 1643. Vid.
Ath. Ox. ii. 24.

Whitlocke says, "May 3, 1643, Cheapside cross and other
crosses were voted down," &amp;c.&mdash;But this Vote was not put in
execution with regard to Charing Cross till four years after, as
appears from Lilly's Observations on the Life, &amp;c. of K. Charles,
viz. "Charing-Cross, we know, was pulled down, 1647, in June,
July, and August. Part of the Stones were converted to pave
before Whitehall. I have seen Knife-hafts made of some of the
stones, which, being well-polished, looked like marble." Ed, 1715,
p. 18, 12mo.



[In Laud's Diary it is written, "1643 Maii 2 Tuesday The
cross in Cheapside taken down."]

See an Account of the pulling down Cheapside Cross, in the
Supplement to Gent. Mag. 1764.





[Charing Cross was the largest and most beautiful of the series
of Eleanor crosses, and the architects employed in the construction
of it were paid &pound;450. The work was formerly attributed to
Cavalini, but that artist was not born until the year 1279, and
was therefore about eleven years old when the Queen died. Since
the publication of the very interesting rolls of payments made by the
executors of Queen Eleanor (Manners and Household Expenses of
England in the 13th and 15th centuries. Roxburghe Club, 1841),
it has been known that Charing Cross was commenced by Richard
de Crundale and completed, after his death, by Roger de Crundale.

The site of the old cross was made use of as a place of execution,
and several of the regicides were put to death there.

The Cheapside cross, which was taken down in 1643, was the
third which occupied the site, and it had only been erected in 1600.
The original cross was found to be in a bad condition in 1441,
and a new one was therefore commenced, which was not finished
until 1486. This was replaced in 1600 by the third cross.

Dr. Rimbault informs us that this ballad is printed with the
music for three voices by "Mr. F. Farmeloe" in "The Second
Book of the Pleasant Musical Companion," 1687.]

[Pg 327]




  



Undone, undone the lawyers are,
They wander about the towne,
Nor can find the way to Westminster,
Now Charing-cross is downe:
At the end of the Strand, they make a stand,                         5
Swearing they are at a loss,
And chaffing say, that's not the way,
They must go by Charing-cross.

The parliament to vote it down
Conceived it very fitting,                                        10
For fear it should fall, and kill them all,
In the house, as they were sitting.
They were told god-wot, it had a plot,
Which made them so hard-hearted,
To give command, it should not stand,                               15
But be taken down and carted.

Men talk of plots, this might have been worse
For any thing I know,
Than that Tomkins, and Chaloner,
Were hang'd for long agoe.                                        20
Our parliament did that prevent,
And wisely them defended,
For plots they will discover still,
Before they were intended.

But neither man, woman, nor child,                                  25
Will say, I'm confident,
They ever heard it speak one word
Against the parliament.
An informer swore, it letters bore,
Or else it had been freed;                                        30
I'll take, in troth, my Bible oath,
It could neither write, nor read.[Pg 328]

The committee said, that verily
To popery it was bent;
For ought I know, it might be so,                                   35
For to church it never went.
What with excise, and such device,
The kingdom doth begin
To think you'll leave them ne'er a cross,
Without doors nor within.                                         40

Methinks the common-council shou'd
Of it have taken pity,
'Cause, good old cross, it always stood
So firmly to the city.
Since crosses you so much disdain,                                  45
Faith, if I were as you,
For fear the king should rule again,
I'd pull down Tiburn too.





XII.

LOYALTY CONFINED.



  

This excellent old song is preserved in David Lloyd's
Memoires of those that suffered in the cause of Charles I.
Lond. 1668, fol. p. 96. He speaks of it as the composition
of a worthy personage, who suffered deeply in
those times, and was still living with no other reward than the
conscience of having suffered. The author's name he has not
mentioned, but, if tradition may be credited, this song was written
by Sir Roger L'Estrange.&mdash;Some mistakes in Lloyd's copy are
corrected by two others, one in MS., the other in the Westminster
Drollery, or a choice Collection of Songs and Poems, 1671, 12mo.





[The ascription of this song to L'Estrange is improbable, and we
must therefore seek elsewhere for an author.]

[Pg 329]




  



Beat on, proud billows; Boreas blow;
Swell, curled waves, high as Jove's roof;
Your incivility doth show,
That innocence is tempest proof;
Though surly Nereus frown, my thoughts are calm;                     5
Then strike, Affliction, for thy wounds are balm.

That which the world miscalls a jail,
A private closet is to me:
Whilst a good conscience is my bail,
And innocence my liberty:                                       10
Locks, bars, and solitude, together met,
Make me no prisoner, but an anchoret.

I, whilst I wisht to be retir'd,
Into this private room was turn'd;
As if their wisdoms had conspir'd                                 15
The salamander should be burn'd;
Or like those sophists, that would drown a fish,
I am constrain'd to suffer what I wish.

The cynick loves his poverty;
The pelican her wilderness;                                     20
And 'tis the Indian's pride to be
Naked on frozen Caucasus:
Contentment cannot smart, Stoicks we see
Make torments easie to their apathy.

These manacles upon my arm                                        25
I, as my mistress' favours, wear;
And for to keep my ancles warm,
I have some iron shackles there:
These walls are but my garrison; this cell,
Which men call jail, doth prove my citadel.                         30[Pg 330]

I'm in the cabinet lockt up,
Like some high-prized margarite,[838]
Or, like the great mogul or pope,
Am cloyster'd up from publick sight:
Retiredness is a piece of majesty,                                  35
And thus, proud sultan, I'm as great as thee.

Here sin for want of food must starve,
Where tempting objects are not seen;
And these strong walls do only serve
To keep vice out, and keep me in:                               40
Malice of late's grown charitable sure,
I'm not committed, but am kept secure.

So he that struck at Jason's life,[839]
Thinking t'have made his purpose sure,
By a malicious friendly knife                                     45
Did only wound him to a cure:
Malice, I see, wants wit; for what is meant
Mischief, oft-times proves favour by th' event.

When once my prince affliction hath,
Prosperity doth treason seem;                                   50
And to make smooth so rough a path,
I can learn patience from him:
Now not to suffer shews no loyal heart,
When kings want ease subjects must bear a part.

What though I cannot see my king                                  55
Neither in person or in coin;
Yet contemplation is a thing
That renders what I have not, mine;
My king from me what adamant can part,
Whom I do wear engraven on my heart?                                60
[Pg 331]
Have you not seen the nightingale,
A prisoner like, coopt in a cage,
How doth she chaunt her wonted tale
In that her narrow hermitage?
Even then her charming melody doth prove,                           65
That all her bars are trees, her cage a grove.

I am that bird, whom they combine
Thus to deprive of liberty;
But though they do my corps confine,
Yet maugre hate, my sould is free:                              70
And though immur'd yet can I chirp, and sing
Disgrace to rebels, glory to my king.

My soul is free, as ambient air,
Although my baser part's immew'd,
Whilst loyal thoughts do still repair                             75
T' accompany my solitude:
Although rebellion do my body binde,
My king alone can captivate my minde.

VERSES BY K. CHARLES I.



  

"This prince, like his father, did not confine himself to
prose: Bishop Burnet has given us a pathetic elegy,
said to be written by Charles in Carisbrook castle (in
1648). The poetry is most uncouth and unharmonious,
but there are strong thoughts in it, some good sense, and a strain
of majestic piety." Mr. Walpole's Royal and Noble Authors, vol. i.

It is in his Memoirs of the Duke of Hamilton, p. 379, that Burnet
hath preserved this elegy, which he tells us he had from a gentleman,
who waited on the king at the time when it was written, and
copied it out from the original. It is there intitled, Majesty in
Misery: or An Imploration to the King of Kings.

Hume hath remarked of these stanzas, "That the truth of the
sentiment, rather than the elegance of expression, renders them[Pg 332]
very pathetic." See his Hist. 1763, 4to. vol. v. pp. 437, 442,
which is no bad comment upon them.&mdash;These are almost the only
verses known of Charles's composition. Indeed a little Poem
On a quiet Conscience, printed in the Poetical Calendar, 1763,
vol. viii. is attributed to K. Charles I.; being reprinted from a
thin 8vo. published by Nahum Tate, called Miscellanea Sacra, or
Poems on Divine and Moral Subjects.




  



Great monarch of the world, from whose power springs
The potency and power of kings,
Record the royal woe my suffering sings;

And teach my tongue, that ever did confine
Its faculties in truth's seraphick line,                             5
To track the treasons of thy foes and mine.

Nature and law, by thy divine decree,
(The only root of righteous royaltie)
With this dim diadem invested me:

With it, the sacred scepter, purple robe,                           10
The holy unction, and the royal globe:
Yet am I levell'd with the life of Job.

The fiercest furies, that do daily tread
Upon my grief, my grey discrowned head,
Are those that owe my bounty for their bread.                       15

They raise a war, and christen it THE CAUSE,
While sacrilegious hands have best applause,
Plunder and murder are the kingdom's laws;

Tyranny bears the title of taxation,
Revenge and robbery are reformation,                                20
Oppression gains the name of sequestration.

My loyal subjects, who in this bad season
Attend me (by the law of God and reason),
They dare impeach, and punish for high treason.[Pg 333]

Next at the clergy do their furies frown,                           25
Pious episcopacy must go down,
They will destroy the crosier and the crown.

Churchmen are chain'd, and schismaticks are freed,
Mechanicks preach, and holy fathers bleed,
The crown is crucified with the creed.                              30

The church of England doth all factions foster,
The pulpit is usurpt by each impostor,
Extempore excludes the Paternoster.

The Presbyter, and Independent seed
Springs with broad blades. To make religion bleed
Herod and Pontius Pilate are agreed.                                36

The corner stone's misplac'd by every pavier:
With such a bloody method and behaviour
Their ancestors did crucifie our Saviour.

My royal consort, from whose fruitful womb                          40
So many princes legally have come,
Is forc'd in pilgrimage to seek a tomb.

Great Britain's heir is forced into France,
Whilst on his father's head his foes advance:
Poor child! he weeps out his inheritance.                           45

With my own power my majesty they wound,
In the king's name the king himself's uncrown'd:
So doth the dust destroy the diamond.

With propositions daily they enchant
My people's ears, such as do reason daunt,                          50
And the Almighty will not let me grant.

They promise to erect my royal stem,
To make me great, t' advance my diadem,
If I will first fall down, and worship them![Pg 334]

But for refusal they devour my thrones,                             55
Distress my children, and destroy my bones;
I fear they'll force me to make bread of stones.

My life they prize at such a slender rate,
That in my absence they draw bills of hate,
To prove the king a traytor to the state.                           60

Felons obtain more privilege than I,
They are allow'd to answer ere they die;
'Tis death for me to ask the reason, why.

But, sacred Saviour, with thy words I woo
Thee to forgive, and not be bitter to                               65
Such, as thou know'st do not know what they do.

For since they from their lord are so disjointed,
As to contemn those edicts he appointed,
How can they prize the power of his anointed?

Augment my patience, nullifie my hate,                              70
Preserve my issue, and inspire my mate,
Yet, though we perish, BLESS THIS CHURCH and STATE.





XIV.

THE SALE OF REBELLIOUS
HOUSHOLD-STUFF.



  

This sarcastic exultation of triumphant loyalty, is printed
from an old black-letter copy in the Pepys collection,
corrected by two others, one of which is preserved in
A choice collection of 120 loyal songs, &amp;c. 1684, 12mo.&mdash;To
the tune of Old Simon the king.





[This triumph over the downfall of the Rump Parliament is one
of the best of the numerous songs that were set to the favourite
tune of Old Simon the King, the full burden of which is&mdash;

[Pg 335]


"Says old Sir Symon the King,
Says old Sir Symon the King,
With his threadbare clothes
And his malmsey nose
Sing hey ding, ding a ding, ding."]





  



Rebellion hath broken up house,
And hath left me old lumber to sell;
Come hither, and take your choice,
I'll promise to use you well:
Will you buy the old speaker's chair?                                5
Which was warm and easie to sit in,
And oft hath been clean'd I declare,
When as it was fouler than fitting.
Says old Simon the king, &amp;c.

Will you buy any bacon-flitches,                                    10
The fattest, that ever were spent?
They're the sides of the old committees,
Fed up in the long parliament.
Here's a pair of bellows, and tongs,
And for a small matter I'll sell ye 'um;                          15
They are made of the presbyters lungs,
To blow up the coals of rebellion.
Says old Simon, &amp;c.

I had thought to have given them once
To some black-smith for his forge;                                20
But now I have considered on't,
They are consecrate to the church:
So I'll give them unto some quire,
They will make the big organs roar,
And the little pipes to squeeke higher,                             25
Than ever they could before.
Says old Simon, &amp;c.[Pg 336]

Here's a couple of stools for sale,
One's square, and t'other is round;
Betwixt them both the tail                                          30
Of the Rump fell down to the ground.
Will you buy the states council-table,
Which was made of the good wain Scot?
The frame was a tottering Babel
To uphold the Independent plot,                                   35
Says old Simon, &amp;c.

Here's the beesom of Reformation,
Which should have made clean the floor,
But it swept the wealth out of the nation,
And left us dirt good store.                                      40
Will you buy the states spinning-wheel,
Which spun for the ropers trade?
But better it had stood still,
For now it has spun a fair thread.
Says old Simon, &amp;c.                                         45

Here's a glyster-pipe well try'd,
Which was made of a butcher's stump,[840]
And has been safely apply'd,
To cure the colds of the rump.
Here's a lump of Pilgrims-Salve,                                    50
Which once was a justice of peace,
Who Noll and the Devil did serve;
But now it is come to this.
Says old Simon, &amp;c.

Here's a roll of the states tobacco,                                55
If any good fellow will take it;
No Virginia had e'er such a smack-o,
And I'll tell you how they did make it:
'Tis th' Engagement, and Covenant cookt[Pg 337]
Up with the Abjuration oath;                                      60
And many of them, that have took't,
Complain it was foul in the mouth.
Says old Simon, &amp;c.

Yet the ashes may happily serve
To cure the scab of the nation,                                   65
Whene'er 't has an itch to swerve
To Rebellion by innovation.
A Lanthorn here is to be bought,
The like was scarce ever gotten,
For many plots it has found out                                     70
Before they ever were thought on.
Says old Simon, &amp;c.

Will you buy the RUMP'S great saddle,
With which it jocky'd the nation?
And here is the bitt, and the bridle,                               75
And curb of Dissimulation:
And here's the trunk-hose of the RUMP,
And their fair dissembling cloak,
And a Presbyterian jump,
With an Independent smock.                                        80
Says old Simon, &amp;c.

Will you buy a Conscience oft turn'd,
Which serv'd the high-court of justice,
And stretch'd until England it mourn'd:
But Hell will buy that if the worst is.                           85
Here's Joan Cromwell's kitching-stuff tub,[841]
Wherein is the fat of the Rumpers,
With which old Noll's horns she did rub,
When he was got drunk with false bumpers.
Says old Simon, &amp;c.                                         90
[Pg 338]
Here's the purse of the public faith;
Here's the model of the Sequestration,
When the old wives upon their good troth,
Lent thimbles to ruine the nation.[842]
Here's Dick Cromwell's Protectorship,                               95
And here are Lambert's commissions,
And here is Hugh Peters his scrip
Cramm'd with the tumultuous Petitions
Says old Simon, &amp;c.

And here are old Noll's brewing vessels,[843]                      100
And here are his dray, and his slings;
Here are Hewson's awl, and his bristles;[843]
With diverse other odd things:
And what is the price doth belong
To all these matters before ye?                                  105
I'll sell them all for an old song,
And so I do end my story.
Says old Simon, &amp;c.

XV.

THE BAFFLED KNIGHT, OR LADY'S
POLICY.



  

Given (with some corrections) from a MS. copy, and
collated with two printed ones in Roman character in
the Pepys collection.





[There are several versions of this story, but the earliest known
to Mr. Chappell is the one printed by Ritson in his Ancient Songs
(vol. ii. ed. 1829, p. 54), beginning&mdash;
[Pg 339]

"Yonder comes a courteous knight,"




with the burden, Then she sang Downe a downe, hey downe derry.
It is from Deuteromelia, or the second part of Musicks melodie or
melodious Musicke, London, 1609. Others are in Pills to purge
Melancholy (iii. 1707, or v. 1719), and in A Complete Collection
of old and new English and Scotch Songs, 8vo., 1735. The copy in
the Roxburghe collection is entitled The Politick Maid, beginning
"There was a knight was wine dronke." Ritson says, "Bp. Percy
found the subject worthy of his best improvements."]




  



There was a knight was drunk with wine,
A riding along the way, sir;
And there he met with a lady fine,
Among the cocks of hay, sir.

Shall you and I, O lady faire,                                       5
Among the grass lye down-a:
And I will have a special care
Of rumpling of your gowne-a.

Upon the grass there is a dewe,
Will spoil my damask gowne, sir:                                  10
My gowne, and kirtle they are newe,
And cost me many a crowne, sir.

I have a cloak of scarlet red,
Upon the ground I'll throwe it;
Then, lady faire, come lay thy head;                                15
We'll play, and none shall knowe it.

O yonder stands my steed so free
Among the cocks of hay, sir;
And if the pinner[844] should chance to see,
He'll take my steed away, sir.                                    20

Upon my finger I have a ring,
Is made of finest gold-a;
And, lady, it thy steed shall bring
Out of the pinner's fold-a.
[Pg 340]
O go with me to my father's hall;                                   25
Fair chambers there are three, sir:
And you shall have the best of all,
And I'll your chamberlaine bee, sir.

He mounted himself on his steed so tall,
And her on her dapple gray, sir:                                  30
And there they rode to her father's hall,
Fast pricking along the way, sir.

To her father's hall they arrived strait;
'Twas moated round about-a;
She slipped herself within the gate,                                35
And lockt the knight without-a.

Here is a silver penny to spend,
And take it for your pain, sir;
And two of my father's men I'll send
To wait on you back again, sir.                                   40

He from his scabbard drew his brand,
And wiped it upon his sleeve-a:
And cursed, he said, be every man,
That will a maid believe-a!

She drew a bodkin from her haire,                                   45
And whip'd it upon her gown-a;
And curs'd be every maiden faire,
That will with men lye down-a!

A herb there is, that lowly grows,
And some do call it rue, sir:                                     50
The smallest dunghill cock that crows,
Would make a capon of you, sir.

A flower there is, that shineth bright,
Some call it mary gold-a;
He that wold not when he might,                                     55
He shall not when he wold-a.[Pg 341]

The knight was riding another day,
With cloak and hat and feather:
He met again with that lady gay,
Who was angling in the river.                                     60

Now, lady faire, I've met with you,
You shall no more escape me;
Remember, how not long agoe
You falsely did intrap me.

The lady blushed scarlet red,                                       65
And trembled at the stranger:
How shall I guard my maidenhead
From this approaching danger?

He from his saddle down did light,
In all his riche attyer;                                          70
And cryed, As I am a noble knight,
I do thy charms admyer.

He took the lady by the hand,
Who seemingly consented;
And would no more disputing stand:                                  75
She had a plot invented.

Looke yonder, good sir knight, I pray,
Methinks I now discover
A riding upon his dapple gray,
My former constant lover.                                         80

On tip-toe peering stood the knight,
Fast by the rivers brink-a;
The lady pusht with all her might:
Sir knight, now swim or sink-a.

O'er head and ears he plunged in,                                   85
The bottom faire he sounded;
Then rising up, he cried amain,
Help, helpe, or else I'm drownded![Pg 342]

Now, fare-you-well, sir knight, adieu!
You see what comes of fooling:                                    90
That is the fittest place for you;
Your courage wanted cooling.

Ere many days, in her fathers park,
Just at the close of eve-a,
Again she met with her angry sparke;                                95
Which made this lady grieve-a.

False lady, here thou'rt in my powre,
And no one now can hear thee:
And thou shalt sorely rue the hour,
That e'er thou dar'dst to jeer me.                                 100

I pray, sir knight, be not so warm
With a young silly maid-a:
I vow and swear I thought no harm,
'Twas a gentle jest I playd-a.

A gentle jest, in soothe! he cry'd,                                105
To tumble me in and leave me:
What if I had in the river dy'd?&mdash;&mdash;
That fetch will not deceive me.

Once more I'll pardon thee this day,
Tho' injur'd out of measure;                                     110
But then prepare without delay
To yield thee to my pleasure.

Well then, if I must grant your suit,
Yet think of your boots and spurs, sir
Let me pull off both spur and boot,                                115
Or else you cannot stir, sir.

He set him down upon the grass,
And begg'd her kind assistance:
Now, smiling thought this lovely lass,
I'll make you keep your distance.                                120[Pg 343]

Then pulling off his boots half-way;
Sir knight, now I'm your betters:
You shall not make of me your prey;
Sit there like a knave in fetters.

The knight when she had served soe,                                125
He fretted, fum'd, and grumbled:
For he could neither stand nor goe,
But like a cripple tumbled.

Farewell, sir knight, the clock strikes ten,
Yet do not move nor stir, sir:                                   130
I'll send you my father's serving men,
To pull off your boots and spurs, sir.

This merry jest you must excuse,
You are but a stingless nettle:
You'd never have stood for boots or shoes,                         135
Had you been a man of mettle.

All night in grievous rage he lay,
Rolling upon the plain-a;
Next morning a shepherd past that way,
Who set him right again-a.                                       140

Then mounting upon his steed so tall,
By hill and dale he swore-a:
I'll ride at once to her father's hall;
She shall escape no more-a.

I'll take her father by the beard,                                 145
I'll challenge all her kindred;
Each dastard soul shall stand affeard;
My wrath shall no more be hindred,

He rode unto her father's house,
Which every side was moated:                                     150
The lady heard his furious vows,
And all his vengeance noted.[Pg 344]

Thought shee, sir knight, to quench your rage,
Once more I will endeavour:
This water shall your fury 'swage,                                 155
Or else it shall burn for ever.

Then faining penitence and feare,
She did invite a parley:
Sir knight, if you'll forgive me heare,
Henceforth I'll love you dearly.                                 160

My father he is now from home,
And I am all alone, sir:
Therefore a-cross the water come;
And I am all your own, sir.

False maid, thou canst no more deceive;                            165
I scorn the treacherous bait-a:
If thou would'st have me thee believe,
Now open me the gate-a.

The bridge is drawn, the gate is barr'd,
My father he has the keys, sir.                                  170
But I have for my love prepar'd
A shorter way and easier.

Over the moate I've laid a plank
Full seventeen feet in measure:
Then step a-cross to the other bank,                               175
And there we'll take our pleasure.

These words she had no sooner spoke,
But strait he came tripping over:
The plank was saw'd, it snapping broke;
And sous'd the unhappy lover.                                    180

WHY SO PALE?



  

From Sir John Suckling's Poems. This sprightly knight
was born in 1613, and cut off by a fever about the 29th
year of his age. See above, Song IX. of this Book.





[This celebrated song occurs in the tragedy of Aglaura, where it
is sung by Orsames, a young lord, who says&mdash;"It is a little foolish
counsel I gave a friend of mine four or five years ago when he was
falling into a consumption."

Dr. Rimbault (Musical Illustrations, p. 29) writes, "The original
air is here given from a MS. volume of old songs with the music,
temp. Charles II. in the collection of the Editor. It was originally
in the Library at Staunton Harold, Leicestershire, the seat of Earl
Ferrers. This beautiful lyric was sung by Mrs. Cross in the Mock
Astrologer, to an air composed by Lewis Ramondon. It was
afterwards reset by Dr. Arne."

The date of the poet's birth given above is incorrect. Suckling
was baptized on the tenth of February, 1608-9, and his mother
died in 1613. Reduced in fortune and an alien, he died of poison
bought by him of an apothecary at Paris. The date of his death
is not known, but it probably took place in 1641, and he certainly
was dead before the year 1642 had ended.]




  



Why so pale and wan, fond lover?
Prethee, why so pale?
Will, when looking well can't move her,
Looking ill prevail?
Prethee, why so pale?                                              5

Why so dull and mute, young sinner?
Prethee why so mute?
Will, when speaking well can't win her,
Saying nothing doe't?
Prethee why so mute?                                              10[Pg 346]

Quit, quit for shame; this will not move,
This cannot take her;
If of herself she will not love,
Nothing can make her.
The devil take her!                                               15





XVII.

OLD TOM OF BEDLAM.


Mad song the First.



  

It is worth attention, that the English have more songs
and ballads on the subject of madness, than any of
their neighbours. Whether there be any truth in the
insinuation, that we are more liable to this calamity
than other nations, or that our native gloominess hath peculiarly
recommended subjects of this cast to our writers; we certainly do
not find the same in the printed collections of French, Italian
Songs, &amp;c.

Out of a much larger quantity, we have selected half a dozen
mad songs for these volumes. The three first are originals in
their respective kinds; the merit of the three last is chiefly that
of imitation. They were written at considerable intervals of time;
but we have here grouped them together, that the reader may the
better examine their comparative merits. He may consider them
as so many trials of skill in a very peculiar subject, as the contest
of so many rivals to shoot in the bow of Ulysses. The two first
were probably written about the beginning of the last century; the
third about the middle of it; the fourth and sixth towards the
end; and the fifth within this present century.

This is given from the Editor's folio MS. compared with two
or three old printed copies.&mdash;With regard to the author of this old
rhapsody, in Walton's Compleat Angler, cap. 3, is a song in praise
of angling, which the author says was made at his request "by
Mr. William Basse, one that has made the choice songs of the
Hunter in his career, and of Tom of Bedlam, and many others
of note," p. 84. See Sir John Hawkins's curious Edition, 8vo. of
that excellent old book.



[Pg 347]

[The madness here referred to was sometimes real, but more
often shammed. These "mad rascals" were so numerous a class
that they obtained the distinctive names of Bedlam beggars, and
Abraham men. Dekker describes their tricks in his Bellman of
London, 1616, where he says, "he calls himself by the name of
Poor Tom, and coming near any body, cries out, 'Poor Tom is a
cold;'" the very expression used by Edgar when he appears in
the disguise of a madman (King Lear). Mr. Chappell observes
that there is great uncertainty as to the authorship, for there are so
many Tom of Bedlam songs that it is impossible to determine from
the passage in the Complete Angler to which of them Walton refers.
It is also doubtful to whom we are indebted for the tune. Mr.
Chappell thinks that probably it was by Henry Lawes's master, John
Cooper, called Cuperario after his visit to Italy. It has been
attributed, without authority, to Henry Purcell and Henry Lawes.]




  



Forth from my sad and darksome cell,
Or from the deepe abysse of hell,[845]
Mad Tom is come into the world againe
To see if he can cure his distempered braine.[846]

Feares and cares oppresse my soule;[847]                             5
Harke, howe the angrye Fureys houle!
Pluto laughes, and Proserpine is gladd[848]
To see poore naked Tom of Bedlam madd.

Through the world I wander night and day[849]
To seeke my straggling senses,                                    10
In an angrye moode I mett old Time,[850]
With his pentarchye of tenses:[851]

When me he spyed,[852]
Away he hyed,[853]
For time will stay for no man:[854]                                 15
In vaine with cryes[Pg 348]
I rent the skyes,[855]
For pity is not common.[856]

Cold and comfortless I lye:
Helpe, oh helpe! or else I dye!                                   20
Harke! I heare Apollo's teame,
The carman 'gins to whistle;
Chast Diana bends her bowe,
The boare begins to bristle.

Come, Vulcan, with tools and with tackles,                          25
To knocke off my troublesome shackles;[857]
Bid Charles make ready his waine
To fetch me my senses againe.[858]

Last night I heard the dog-star bark;
Mars met Venus in the darke;                                        30
Limping Vulcan het[859] an iron barr,[860]
And furiouslye made at the god of war:[861]

Mars with his weapon laid about,[862]
But Vulcan's temples had the gout,
For his broad horns did so hang in his light,[863]                  35
He could not see to aim his blowes aright:[864]

Mercurye the nimble post of heaven,
Stood still to see the quarrell;[865]
Gorrel-bellyed[866] Bacchus, gyant-like,
Bestryd a strong-beere barrell.                                   40

To mee he dranke,
I did him thanke,
But I could get no cyder;
He dranke whole butts[Pg 349]
Till he burst his gutts,                                          45
But mine were ne'er the wyder.

Poore naked Tom is very drye:
A little drinke for charitye!

Harke, I hear Acteon's horne!
The huntsmen whoop and hallowe:                                   50
Ringwood, Royster, Bowman, Jowler,
All the chase do followe.

The man in the moone drinkes clarret,
Eates powder'd beef, turnip, and carret,
But a cup of old Malaga sack                                        55
Will fire the bushe at his backe.

XVIII.

THE DISTRACTED PURITAN,


Mad song the second,



  

Was written about the beginning of the seventeenth century
by the witty bishop Corbet, and is printed from
the 3d edition of his Poems, 12mo. 1672, compared
with a more ancient copy in the Editor's folio MS.





[This song was printed in Le Prince d'Amour, 1660, with three
other songs entitled Tom of Bedlam. It was also printed in the
Rump Songs, 1662, but not in the edition of 1660.

The copy in the folio MS. (ed. Hales and Furnivall, vol. iii.
p. 269) has several alterations. Stanza 5 was taken by Percy
from the MS., where it occurs as stanza 8.

Richard Corbet, successively Bishop of Oxford and Norwich,
was born at Ewell in Surrey in 1582. He died in 1635. He was
a humorous man, and many pleasant stories are told of him, but
Aubrey describes his appearance as "grave and venerable."

[Pg 350]




  



Am I mad, O noble Festus,
When zeal and godly knowledge
Have put me in hope
To deal with the pope,
As well as the best in the college?                                  5
Boldly I preach, hate a cross, hate a surplice,
Mitres, copes, and rochets;
Come hear me pray nine times a day,
And fill your heads with crochets.

In the house of pure Emanuel[867]                                   10
I had my education,
Where my friends surmise
I dazel'd my eyes
With the sight of revelation.
Boldly I preach, &amp;c.

They bound me like a bedlam,                                        15
They lash'd my four poor quarters;
Whilst this I endure,
Faith makes me sure
To be one of Foxes martyrs.
Boldly I preach, &amp;c.

These injuries I suffer                                             20
Through antichrist's perswasion:
Take off this chain,[Pg 351]
Neither Rome nor Spain
Can resist my strong invasion.
Boldly I preach, &amp;c.

Of the beast's ten horns (God bless us!)                            25
I have knock'd off three already;
If they let me alone
I'll leave him none:
But they say I am too heady.
Boldly I preach, &amp;c.

When I sack'd the seven-hill'd city,                                30
I met the great red dragon;
I kept him aloof
With the armour of proof,
Though here I have never a rag on.
Boldly I preach, &amp;c.

With a fiery sword and target,                                      35
There fought I with this monster:
But the sons of pride
My zeal deride,
And all my deeds misconster.
Boldly I preach, &amp;c.

I un-hors'd the Whore of Babel,                                     40
With the lance of Inspiration;
I made her slink,
And spill the drink
In her cup of abomination.
Boldly I preach, &amp;c.

I have seen two in a vision                                         45
With a flying-book[868] between them.
I have been in despair[Pg 352]
Five times in a year,
And been cur'd by reading Greenham.[869]
Boldly I preach, &amp;c.

I observ'd in Perkin's tables[870]                                  50
The black line of damnation;
Those crooked veins
So stuck in my brains,
That I fear'd my reprobation.
Boldly I preach, &amp;c.

In the holy tongue of Canaan                                        55
I plac'd my chiefest pleasure:
Till I prick'd my foot
With an Hebrew root,
That I bled beyond all measure.
Boldly I preach, &amp;c.
[Pg 353]
I appear'd before the archbishop,[871]                              60
And all the high commission;
I gave him no grace,
But told him to his face,
That he favour'd superstition.
Boldly I preach, hate a cross, hate a surplice,
Mitres, copes, and rochets:                                   66
Come hear me pray nine times a day,
And fill your heads with crotchets.


FOOTNOTES:



[867] Emanuel college, Cambridge, was originally a seminary of
Puritans.


[Fuller has left us the following anecdote of Sir Walter Mildmay,
the founder of Emanuel, in his History of the University of Cambridge.
"Coming to court after he had founded his college, the queen told
him, 'Sir Walter, I hear you have erected a Puritan foundation.'
'No madam,' saith he, 'far be it from me to countenance anything
contrary to your established laws; but I have set an acorn,
which, when it becomes an oak, God alone knows what will be the
fruit thereof.'"]



[868] Alluding to some visionary exposition of Zech. ch. v. ver. 1;
or, if the date of this song would permit, one might suppose it
aimed at one Coppe, a strange enthusiast, whose life may be seen
in Wood's Athen. vol. ii. p. 501. He was author of a book, intitled,
The Fiery Flying Roll: and afterwards published a Recantation,
part of whose title is, The Fiery Flying Roll's Wings
clipt, &amp;c.



[869] See Greenham's Works, fol. 1605, particularly the tract intitled,
A sweet Comfort for an afflicted Conscience.


[Richard Greenham was born circa 1531 and died in 1591. He
was a singularly ardent preacher, and Brook, in his Lives of the
Puritans, says, that "in addition to his public ministerial labours
he had a remarkable talent for comforting afflicted consciences."
His Works were first collected in 1599.]



[870] See Perkin's Works, fol. 1616, vol. i. p. 11; where is a large
half sheet folded, containing, A survey, or table, declaring the order
of the causes of salvation and damnation, &amp;c. the pedigree of damnation
being distinguished by a broad black zig-zag line.


[William Perkins (1558-1602). Brook says of him, that he used
to pronounce the word damn with so peculiar an emphasis "that it
left a doleful echo in the eares a long time after." His works were
frequently reprinted, and, according to Fuller, were translated into
Latin, French, Dutch, and Spanish.]

XIX.

THE LUNATIC LOVER,


Mad song the third,



  

Is given from an old printed copy in the British Museum,
compared with another in the Pepys collection; both
in black letter.





[Black-letter copies of this ballad are to be found in the Bagford,
Douce, and Roxburghe collections, as well as in the Pepys.
The tune was a favourite one, and several other ballads were
sung to it.]




  



Grim king of the ghosts, make haste,
And bring hither all your train;
See how the pale moon does waste,
And just now is in the wane.
Come, you night-hags, with all your charms,                          5
And revelling witches away,
And hug me close in your arms;
To you my respects I'll pay.
[Pg 354]
I'll court you, and think you fair,
Since love does distract my brain:                                10
I'll go, I'll wed the night-mare,
And kiss her, and kiss her again:
But if she prove peevish and proud,
Then, a pise on her love! let her go;
I'll seek me a winding shroud,                                      15
And down to the shades below.

A lunacy sad I endure,
Since reason departs away;
I call to those hags for a cure
As knowing not what I say.                                        20
The beauty, whom I do adore,
Now slights me with scorn and disdain;
I never shall see her more;
Ah! how shall I bear my pain!

I ramble, and range about                                           25
To find out my charming saint;
While she at my grief does flout,
And smiles at my loud complaint.
Distraction I see is my doom,
Of this I am now too sure;                                        30
A rival is got in my room,
While torments I do endure.

Strange fancies do fill my head,
While wandering in despair,
I am to the desarts lead,                                           35
Expecting to find her there.
Methinks in a spangled cloud
I see her enthroned on high;
Then to her I crie aloud,
And labour to reach the sky.                                      40[Pg 355]

When thus I have raved awhile,
And wearyed myself in vain,
I lye on the barren soil,
And bitterly do complain.
Till slumber hath quieted me,                                       45
In sorrow I sigh and weep;
The clouds are my canopy
To cover me while I sleep.

I dream that my charming fair
Is then in my rival's bed,                                        50
Whose tresses of golden hair
Are on the fair pillow bespread.
Then this doth my passion inflame
I start, and no longer can lie:
Ah! Sylvia, art thou not to blame                                   55
To ruin a lover? I cry.

Grim king of the ghosts, be true,
And hurry me hence away,
My languishing life to you
A tribute I freely pay.                                           60
To the elysian shades I post
In hopes to be freed from care.
Where many a bleeding ghost
Is hovering in the air.






[Pg 356]




XX.

THE LADY DISTRACTED WITH LOVE,


Mad Song the Fourth,



  

Was originally sung in one of Tom D'urfey's comedies
of Don Quixote in 1694 and 1696; and probably
composed by himself. In the several stanzas, the author
represents his pretty Mad-woman as 1. sullenly mad:
2. mirthfully mad: 3. melancholy mad: 4. fantastically mad: and
5. stark mad. Both this, and Num. XXII. are printed from D'urfey's
Pills to purge Melancholy, 1719, vol. i.




  



From rosie bowers, where sleeps the god of love,
Hither ye little wanton cupids fly;
Teach me in soft melodious strains to move
With tender passion my heart's darling joy:
Ah! let the soul of musick tune my voice,                            5
To win dear Strephon, who my soul enjoys.

Or, if more influencing
Is to be brisk and airy,
With a step and a bound,
With a frisk from the ground,                                   10
I'll trip like any fairy.

As once on Ida dancing
Were three celestial bodies:
With an air, and a face,
And a shape, and a grace,                                       15
I'll charm, like beauty's goddess.[Pg 357]

Ah! 'tis in vain! 'tis all, 'tis all in vain!
Death and despair must end the fatal pain:
Cold, cold despair, disguis'd like snow and rain,
Falls on my breast; bleak winds in tempests blow;
My veins all shiver, and my fingers glow:                         21
My pulse beats a dead march for lost repose,
And to a solid lump of ice my poor fond heart is froze.

Or say, ye powers, my peace to crown,
Shall I thaw myself, and drown                                      25
Among the foaming billows?
Increasing all with tears I shed,
On beds of ooze, and crystal pillows,
Lay down, lay down my lovesick head?

No, no, I'll strait run mad, mad, mad,                              30
That soon my heart will warm;
When once the sense is fled, is fled,
Love has no power to charm.
Wild thro' the woods I'll fly, I'll fly,
Robes, locks&mdash;&mdash;shall thus&mdash;&mdash;be tore!                            35
A thousand, thousand times I'll dye
Ere thus, thus, in vain,&mdash;ere thus in vain adore.





XXI.

THE DISTRACTED LOVER,


Mad Song the Fifth,



  

Was written by Henry Carey, a celebrated composer of
music at the beginning of this century, and author
of several little Theatrical Entertainments, which the
reader may find enumerated in the Companion to the
Play-house, &amp;c. The sprightliness of this songster's fancy could
not preserve him from a very melancholy catastrophe, which was[Pg 358]
effected by his own hand. In his Poems, 4to. Lond. 1729, may be
seen another Mad-Song of this author, beginning thus:


"Gods! I can never this endure,
Death alone must be my cure," &amp;c.





  



I go to the Elysian shade,
Where sorrow ne'er shall wound me;
Where nothing shall my rest invade,
But joy shall still surround me.

I fly from Celia's cold disdain,                                   5
From her disdain I fly;
She is the cause of all my pain,
For her alone I die.

Her eyes are brighter than the mid-day sun,
When he but half his radiant course has run,                        10
When his meridian glories gaily shine,
And gild all nature with a warmth divine.

See yonder river's flowing tide,
Which now so full appears;
Those streams, that do so swiftly glide,                          15
Are nothing but my tears.

There I have wept till I could weep no more,
And curst mine eyes, when they have wept their store:
Then, like the clouds, that rob the azure main,
I've drain'd the flood to weep it back again.                       20

Pity my pains,
Ye gentle swains!
Cover me with ice and snow,
I scorch, I burn, I flame, I glow![Pg 359]

Furies, tear me,                                                  25
Quickly bear me
To the dismal shades below!
Where yelling, and howling
And grumbling, and growling
Strike the ear with horrid woe.                                     30

Hissing snakes,
Fiery lakes
Would be a pleasure, and a cure:
Not all the hells,
Where Pluto dwells,                                               35
Can give such pain as I endure.

To some peaceful plain convey me,
On a mossey carpet lay me,
Fan me with ambrosial breeze,
Let me die, and so have ease!                                       40






XXII.

THE FRANTIC LADY,


Mad Song the Sixth.



  

This, like Num. XX., was originally sung in one of
D'urfey's comedies of Don Quixote, (first acted
about the year 1694) and was probably composed by
that popular songster, who died Feb. 26, 1723.

This is printed in the Hive, a Collection of Songs, 4 vols. 1721,
12mo. where may be found two or three other Mad Songs not
admitted into these Volumes.

[Pg 360]




  



I burn, my brain consumes to ashes!
Each eye-ball too like lightning flashes!
Within my breast there glows a solid fire,
Which in a thousand ages can't expire!

Blow, blow, the winds' great ruler!                              5
Bring the Po, and the Ganges hither,
'Tis sultry weather,
Pour them all on my soul,
It will hiss like a coal,
But be never the cooler.                                        10

'Twas pride hot as hell,
That first made me rebell,
From love's awful throne a curst angel I fell
And mourn now my fate,
Which myself did create:                                        15
Fool, fool, that consider'd not when I was well!

Adieu! ye vain transporting joys!
Off ye vain fantastic toys!
That dress this face&mdash;this body&mdash;to allure!
Bring me daggers, poison, fire!                                 20
Since scorn is turn'd into desire.
All hell feels not the rage, which I, poor I, endure.





XXIII.

LILLI BURLERO.



  

The following rhymes, slight and insignificant as they
may now seem, had once a more powerful effect than
either the Philippics of Demosthenes, or Cicero; and
contributed not a little towards the great revolution in
1688. Let us hear a contemporary writer.

"A foolish ballad was made at that time, treating the Papists,[Pg 361]
and chiefly the Irish, in a very ridiculous manner, which had a
burden said to be Irish words, Lero, lero, liliburlero, that made an
impression on the (king's) army, that cannot be imagined by those
that saw it not. The whole army, and at last the people, both in
city and country, were singing it perpetually. And perhaps never
had so slight a thing so great an effect."&mdash;Burnet.

It was written, or at least republished, on the earl of Tyrconnel's
going a second time to Ireland in October, 1688. Perhaps it is
unnecessary to mention, that General Richard Talbot, newly
created earl of Tyrconnel, had been nominated by K. James II.
to the lieutenancy of Ireland in 1686, on account of his being a
furious papist, who had recommended himself to his bigotted
master by his arbitrary treatment of the protestants in the preceding
year, when only lieutenant general, and whose subsequent
conduct fully justified his expectations and their fears. The violences
of his administration may be seen in any of the histories of
those times: particularly in bishop King's State of the Protestants
in Ireland, 1691, 4to.

This song is attributed to Lord Wharton in a small pamphlet,
intitled, A true relation of the several facts and circumstances of the
intended riot and tumult on Q. Elizabeth's birth-day, &amp;c. 3d. ed.
Lond. 1712, pr. 2d.&mdash;See p. 5, viz.&mdash;"A late Viceroy (of Ireland,)
who has so often boasted himself upon his talent for mischief
invention, lying, and for making a certain Lilliburlero Song; with
which, if you will believe himself, he sung a deluded Prince out
of Three Kingdoms."

Lilliburlero and Bullen-a-lah are said to have been the words of
distinction used among the Irish Papists in their massacre of the
Protestants in 1641.





[To no song could be better attributed Fletcher of Saltoun's
dictum than to this poor specimen of verse, which caught the fancy
of the people and drove James from his throne. Macaulay wrote
of it as follows:&mdash;"From one end of England to the other all
classes were constantly singing this idle rhyme. It was especially
the delight of the English army. More than seventy years after the
Revolution, Sterne delineated with exquisite skill a veteran who
had fought at the Boyne and at Namur. One of the characteristics
of the good old soldier is his trick of whistling Lilliburlero." The
air is attributed to Purcell, but it is supposed that he only arranged
an earlier tune. Hume thought that the popularity of the song
was rather due to the composer of the air than to the author of
the words.

Mr. Markland, in a note to Boswell's Life of Johnson, says, that
"according to Lord Dartmouth there was a particular expression
in it, which the king remembered that he had made use of to the[Pg 362]
Earl of Dorset, from whence it was concluded that he was the
author." Upon this Mr. Chappell remarks, 1. that "the Earl of
Dorset laid no claim to it, and it is scarcely to be believed that
the author of To all you ladies now on land could have penned
such thorough doggrel." 2. That "the ballad contains no expression
that the King would have used, which might not equally
have been employed by any other person."[872] There can now be
little doubt that the author was Thomas Marquis of Wharton,
father of the mad Duke Philip of Wharton. He discerned the
indications of the political horizon and espoused the winning side.
He was well rewarded for his wisdom. Mr. S. Redmond (Notes
and Queries, third series, viii. 13) writes that he has often heard
the girls in the south and south-east of Ireland, while engaged in
binding the corn into sheaves after the reapers, sing the following
chorus, which always had reference to one of the gang who was
not so quick at her work as the others, and who consequently was
left behind:


"Lully by lero,
Lully by lero,
Lully by lero,
Help her along."]

THE BRAES OF YARROW,


In Imitation of the Ancient Scots Manner,



  

Was written by William Hamilton, of Bangour, Esq; who
died March 25, 1734, aged 50. It is printed from an
elegant edition of his Poems, published at Edinburgh,
1760, 12mo. This song was written in imitation of an
old Scottish ballad on a similar subject, with the same burden to
each stanza.





[The beautiful river Yarrow has few rivals as an inspirer of song.
These verses of Hamilton's are copied from the old ballad&mdash;The
Dowie Dens (melancholy downs) of Yarrow, a collated version of
which was first printed by Scott in his Minstrelsy of the Scottish
Border. Scott was of opinion that with many readers the greatest
recommendation of the old ballad will be that it suggested to
Hamilton his modern one. We may say that the greatest recommendation
of Hamilton's poem to us is the fact that it inspired
Wordsworth to write his three lovely little poems, Yarrow Unvisited,
Visited, and Revisited.

There are two old ballads which have been much mixed up by
reciters, viz. The Dowie Dens and Willie's drowned in Yarrow.
The Rev. John Logan's Braes of Yarrow is founded on the latter.

William Hamilton of Bangour was born in 1704 and died at
Lyons in 1754, from which place his remains were brought to
Scotland, and interred in Holyrood Abbey. He was a Jacobite,
and after the battle of Culloden was forced to skulk about the
Highlands in disguise until he was able to escape to France. He
returned to Scotland after the country had quieted down in 1749.]

A. Busk[875] ye, busk ye, my bonny bonny bride,
Busk ye, busk ye, my winsome marrow,[876]
Busk ye, busk ye, my bonny bonny bride,
And think nae mair on the Braes[877] of Yarrow.

B. Where gat ye that bonny bonny bride?                       5
Where gat ye that winsome marrow?
A. I gat her where I dare na weil be seen,
Puing the birks[878] on the Braes of Yarrow.

Weep not, weep not, my bonny bonny bride,
Weep not, weep not, my winsome marrow;                            10
Nor let thy heart lament to leive
Puing the birks on the Braes of Yarrow.

B. Why does she weep, thy bonny bonny bride?
Why does she weep thy winsome marrow?
And why dare ye nae mair weil be seen                               15
Puing the birks on the Braes of Yarrow?

A. Lang maun she weep, lang maun she, maun she weep,
Lang maun she weep with dule and sorrow;
And lang maun I nae mair weil be seen
Puing the birks on the Braes of Yarrow.                           20

For she has tint[879] her luver, luver dear,
Her luver dear, the cause of sorrow;
And I hae slain the comliest swain
That eir pu'd birks on the Braes of Yarrow.
[Pg 366]
Why rins thy stream, O Yarrow, Yarrow, reid?                        25
Why on thy braes heard the voice of sorrow?
And why yon melancholious weids
Hung on the bonny birks of Yarrow?

What's yonder floats on the rueful rueful flude?
What's yonder floats? O dule and sorrow!                          30
O 'tis he the comely swain I slew
Upon the duleful Braes of Yarrow.

Wash, O wash his wounds, his wounds in tears,
His wounds in tears with dule and sorrow;
And wrap his limbs in mourning weids,                               35
And lay him on the Braes of Yarrow.

Then build, then build, ye sisters, sisters sad,
Ye sisters sad, his tomb with sorrow;
And weep around in waeful wise
His hapless fate on the Braes of Yarrow.                          40

Curse ye, curse ye, his useless, useless shield,
My arm that wrought the deed of sorrow,
The fatal spear that pierc'd his breast,
His comely breast on the Braes of Yarrow.

Did I not warn thee, not to, not to luve?                           45
And warn from fight? but to my sorrow
Too rashly bauld a stronger arm
Thou mett'st, and fell'st on the Braes of Yarrow.

Sweet smells the birk, green grows, green grows the grass,
Yellow on Yarrow's bank the gowan,[880]                           50
Fair hangs the apple frae the rock,
Sweet the wave of Yarrow flowan.
[Pg 367]
Flows Yarrow sweet? as sweet, as sweet flows Tweed,
As green its grass, its gowan as yellow,
As sweet smells on its braes the birk,                              55
The apple frae its rock as mellow.

Fair was thy luve, fair fair indeed thy luve,
In flow'ry bands thou didst him fetter;
Tho' he was fair, and weil beluv'd again
Than me he never luv'd thee better.                               60

Busk ye, then busk, my bonny bonny bride,
Busk ye, busk ye, my winsome marrow,
Busk ye, and luve me on the banks of Tweed,
And think nae mair on the Braes of Yarrow.

C. How can I busk a bonny bonny bride?                       65
How can I busk a winsome marrow?
How luve him upon the banks of Tweed,
That slew my luve on the Braes of Yarrow?

O Yarrow fields, may never never rain,
Nor dew thy tender blossoms cover,                                70
For there was basely slain my luve,
My luve, as he had not been a lover.

The boy put on his robes, his robes of green,
His purple vest, 'twas my awn sewing:
Ah! wretched me! I little, little kenn'd                            75
He was in these to meet his ruin.

The boy took out his milk-white, milk-white steed,
Unheedful of my dule and sorrow:
But ere the toofall[881] of the night
He lay a corps on the Braes of Yarrow.                            80
[Pg 368]
Much I rejoyc'd that waeful waeful day;
I sang, my voice the woods returning:
But lang ere night the spear was flown,
That slew my luve, and left me mourning.

What can my barbarous barbarous father do,                          85
But with his cruel rage pursue me?
My luver's blood is on thy spear,
How canst thou, barbarous man, then wooe me?

My happy sisters may be, may be proud
With cruel, and ungentle scoffin',                                90
May bid me seek on Yarrow's Braes
My luver nailed in his coffin.

My brother Douglas may upbraid, upbraid,
And strive with threatning words to muve me:
My luver's blood is on thy spear,                                   95
How canst thou ever bid me luve thee?

Yes, yes, prepare the bed, the bed of luve,
With bridal sheets my body cover,
Unbar, ye bridal maids, the door,
Let in the expected husband lover.                               100

But who the expected husband husband is?
His hands, methinks, are bath'd in slaughter:
Ah me! what ghastly spectre's yon
Comes in his pale shroud, bleeding after?

Pale as he is, here lay him, lay him down,                         105
O lay his cold head on my pillow;
Take aff, take aff these bridal weids,
And crown my careful head with willow.

Pale tho' thou art, yet best, yet best beluv'd,
O could my warmth to life restore thee!                          110
Yet lye all night between my breists,
No youth lay ever there before thee.[Pg 369]

Pale, pale indeed, O luvely luvely youth,
Forgive, forgive, so foul a slaughter,
And lye all night between my breists,                              115
No youth shall ever lye there after.

A. Return, return, O mournful, mournful bride,
Return and dry thy useless sorrow:
Thy luver heeds none of thy sighs,
He lyes a corps in the Braes of Yarrow.                          120

XXV.

ADMIRAL HOSIER'S GHOST



  

Was a party song written by the ingenious author of
Leonidas,[882] on the taking of Porto Bello from the Spaniards
by Admiral Vernon, Nov. 22, 1739.&mdash;The case
of Hosier, which is here so pathetically represented,
was briefly this. In April, 1726, that commander was sent with a
strong fleet into the Spanish West-Indies, to block up the galleons
in the ports of that country, or should they presume to come out,
to seize and carry them into England: he accordingly arrived at
the Bastimentos near Porto Bello, but being employed rather to
overawe than to attack the Spaniards, with whom it was probably
not our interest to go to war, he continued long inactive on that
station, to his own great regret. He afterwards removed to Carthagena,
and remained cruizing in these seas, till far the greater part
of his men perished deplorably by the diseases of that unhealthy
climate. This brave man, seeing his best officers and men thus
daily swept away, his ships exposed to inevitable destruction, and
himself made the sport of the enemy, is said to have died of a
broken heart. Such is the account of Smollett, compared with
that of other less partial writers.

The following song is commonly accompanied with a Second
Part, or Answer, which being of inferior merit, and apparently
written by another hand, hath been rejected.
[Pg 370]




[Dr. Rimbault (Musical Illustrations, p. 30) writes: "The earliest
copy of the tune to this ballad is contained in the ballad opera of
Sylvia, or the Country Burial, 1731. It may also be found in
Walsh's British Musical Miscellany, vol. iv. and in other works of
a similar description. The ballads of Come and listen to my ditty
and Cease, rude Boreas, were sung to this tune, which appears to
have been always a favourite for 'sea ditties.'"

In Hannah More's Life (vol. i. p. 405) is the following interesting
note: "I was much amused with hearing old Leonidas Glover
sing his own fine ballad of Hosier's Ghost, which was very affecting.
He is past eighty." In the matter of the last item Mrs. More was
wrong. Richard Glover was born in 1712, and died on Nov. 25,
1785.]




  



As near Porto-Bello lying
On the gently swelling flood,
At midnight with streamers flying
Our triumphant navy rode;
There while Vernon sate all-glorious                                 5
From the Spaniards' late defeat:
And his crews, with shouts victorious,
Drank success to England's fleet:

On a sudden shrilly sounding,
Hideous yells and shrieks were heard;                             10
Then each heart with fear confounding,
A sad troop of ghosts appear'd,
All in dreary hammocks shrouded,
Which for winding-sheets they wore,
And with looks by sorrow clouded                                    15
Frowning on that hostile shore.

On them gleam'd the moon's wan lustre,
When the shade of Hosier brave
His pale bands was seen to muster
Rising from their watry grave.                                    20[Pg 371]
O'er the glimmering wave he hy'd him,
Where the Burford[883] rear'd her sail,
With three thousand ghosts beside him,
And in groans did Vernon hail.

Heed, oh heed our fatal story,                                      25
I am Hosier's injur'd ghost,
You, who now have purchas'd glory,
At this place where I was lost!
Tho' in Porto-Bello's ruin
You now triumph free from fears,                                  30
When you think on our undoing,
You will mix your joy with tears.

See these mournful spectres sweeping
Ghastly o'er this hated wave,
Whose wan cheeks are stain'd with weeping;                          35
These were English captains brave.
Mark those numbers pale and horrid,
Those were once my sailors bold:
Lo, each hangs his drooping forehead,
While his dismal tale is told.                                    40

I, by twenty sail attended,
Did this Spanish town affright;
Nothing then its wealth defended
But my orders not to fight.
Oh! that in this rolling ocean                                      45
I had cast them with disdain,
And obey'd my heart's warm motion
To have quell'd the pride of Spain!

For resistance I could fear none,
But with twenty ships had done                                    50
What thou, brave and happy Vernon,
Hast atchiev'd with six alone.
Then the bastimentos never[Pg 372]
Had our foul dishonour seen,
Nor the sea the sad receiver                                        55
Of this gallant train had been.

Thus, like thee, proud Spain dismaying,
And her galleons leading home,
Though condemn'd for disobeying,
I had met a traitor's doom,                                       60
To have fallen, my country crying
He has play'd an English part,
Had been better far than dying
Of a griev'd and broken heart.

Unrepining at thy glory,                                            65
Thy successful arms we hail;
But remember our sad story,
And let Hosier's wrongs prevail.
Sent in this foul clime to languish,
Think what thousands fell in vain,                                70
Wasted with disease and anguish,
Not in glorious battle slain.

Hence with all my train attending
From their oozy tombs below,
Thro' the hoary foam ascending,                                     75
Here I feed my constant woe:
Here the bastimentos viewing,
We recal our shameful doom,
And our plaintive cries renewing,
Wander thro' the midnight gloom.                                  80

O'er these waves for ever mourning
Shall we roam depriv'd of rest,
If to Britain's shores returning
You neglect my just request;[Pg 373]
After this proud foe subduing,                                      85
When your patriot friends you see,
Think on vengeance for my ruin,
And for England sham'd in me.

James Dawson was one of the Manchester rebels,
who was hanged, drawn, and quartered, on Kennington-common,
in the county of Surrey, July 30, 1746.&mdash;This
ballad is founded on a remarkable fact, which was
reported to have happened at his execution. It was written by
the late William Shenstone, Esq; soon after the event, and has
been printed amongst his posthumous works, 2 vols. 8vo. It is
here given from a MS. which contained some small variations from
that printed copy.





[Captain James Dawson was one of eight officers belonging to
the Manchester regiment of Volunteers in the service of the young
Chevalier, who were executed on Kennington Common.

The following ballad is founded upon a narrative first published
in a periodical entitled The Parrot, Saturday, 2d August, 1746,
three days after the occurrence. In the Whitehall Evening Post,
Aug. 7, 1746, the same story is told with the addition, that "upon
enquiry every circumstance was literally true." Another ballad is
said to have been written upon Dawson's fate, and sung about the
streets. It is reprinted in the European Magazine, April, 1801,
p. 248, and begins as follows:


"Blow ye bleak winds around my head,
Sooth my heart corroding care, &amp;c."]





  



Come listen to my mournful tale,
Ye tender hearts, and lovers dear;
Nor will you scorn to heave a sigh,
Nor will you blush to shed a tear[Pg 374]

And thou, dear Kitty, peerless maid,                                 5
Do thou a pensive ear incline;
For thou canst weep at every woe,
And pity every plaint, but mine.

Young Dawson was a gallant youth,
A brighter never trod the plain;                                  10
And well he lov'd one charming maid,
And dearly was he lov'd again.

One tender maid she lov'd him dear,
Of gentle blood the damsel came,
And faultless was her beauteous form,                               15
And spotless was her virgin fame.

But curse on party's hateful strife,
That led the faithful youth astray
The day the rebel clans appear'd:
O had he never seen that day!                                     20

Their colours and their sash he wore,
And in the fatal dress was found;
And now he must that death endure,
Which gives the brave the keenest wound.

How pale was then his true love's cheek,                            25
When Jemmy's sentence reach'd her ear!
For never yet did Alpine snows
So pale, nor yet so chill appear.

With faltering voice she weeping said,
Oh Dawson, monarch of my heart,                                   30
Think not thy death shall end our loves,
For thou and I will never part.

Yet might sweet mercy find a place,
And bring relief to Jemmy's woes,
O George, without a prayer for thee                        35
My orisons should never close.[Pg 375]

The gracious prince that gives him life
Would crown a never-dying flame,
And every tender babe I bore
Should learn to lisp the giver's name.                            40

But though, dear youth, thou should'st be dragg'd
To yonder ignominious tree,
Thou shalt not want a faithful friend
To share thy bitter fate with thee.

O then her mourning coach was call'd,                               45
The sledge mov'd slowly on before;
Tho' borne in a triumphal car,
She had not lov'd her favourite more.

She followed him, prepar'd to view
The terrible behests of law;                                      50
And the last scene of Jemmy's woes
With calm and stedfast eye she saw.

Distorted was that blooming face,
Which she had fondly lov'd so long:
And stifled was that tuneful breath,                                55
Which in her praise had sweetly sung:

And sever'd was that beauteous neck,
Round which her arms had fondly clos'd:
And mangled was that beauteous breast,
On which her love-sick head repos'd:                              60

And ravish'd was that constant heart,
She did to every heart prefer;
For tho' it could his king forget,
'Twas true and loyal still to her.

Amid those unrelenting flames                                       65
She bore this constant heart to see;
But when 'twas moulder'd into dust,
Now, now, she cried, I'll follow thee.[Pg 376]

My death, my death alone can show
The pure and lasting love I bore:                                 70
Accept, O heaven, of woes like ours,
And let us, let us weep no more.

The dismal scene was o'er and past,
The lover's mournful hearse retir'd;
The maid drew back her languid head,                                75
And sighing forth his name, expir'd.

Tho' justice ever must prevail,
The tear my Kitty sheds is due;
For seldom shall she hear a tale
So sad, so tender, and so true.                                   80

APPENDIX.




ON THE ALLITERATIVE METRE,
WITHOUT RHYME, IN PIERCE
PLOWMAN'S VISIONS.



  

We learn from Wormius[884], that the ancient
Islandic poets used a great variety of
measures: he mentions 136 different
kinds, without including rhyme, or a
correspondence of final syllables, yet this was occasionally
used, as appears from the Ode of Egil,
which Wormius hath inserted in his book.

He hath analysed the structure of one of these
kinds of verse, the harmony of which neither depended
on the quantity of the syllables, like that of
the ancient Greeks and Romans; nor on the rhymes
at the end, as in modern poetry; but consisted altogether
in alliteration, or a certain artful repetition
of the sounds in the middle of the verses. This was
adjusted according to certain rules of their prosody,
[Pg 380]one of which was, that every distich should contain
at least three words beginning with the same letter
or sound. Two of these correspondent sounds might
be placed either in the first or second line of the
distich, and one in the other: but all three were not
regularly to be crowded into one line. This will be
best understood by the following examples[885]:


"Meire og Minne
Mogu heimdaller."

"Gab Ginuga
Enn Gras huerge."


There were many other little niceties observed by
the Islandic poets, who, as they retained their original
language and peculiarities longer than the other
nations of Gothic race, had time to cultivate their
native poetry more, and to carry it to a higher pitch
of refinement, than any of the rest.

Their brethren, the Anglo-Saxon poets, occasionally
used the same kind of alliteration, and it is
common to meet, in their writings, with similar
examples of the foregoing rules. Take an instance
or two in modern characters[886]:


"Skeop tha and Skyrede
Skyppend ure."

"Ham and Heahsetl
Heofena rikes."


I know not, however, that there is anywhere extant
an entire Saxon poem all in this measure. But distichs
of this sort perpetually occur in all their poems
of any length.

Now if we examine the versification of Pierce
Plowman's Visions, we shall find it constructed exactly
by these rules; and therefore each line, as
printed, is in reality a distich of two verses, and will,
I believe, be found distinguished as such, by some
mark or other in all the ancient MSS. viz.:

[Pg 381]
"In a Somer Season, | when 'hot'[887] was the Sunne,
I Shope me into Shroubs, | as I a Shepe were;
In Habite as an Harmet | unHoly of werkes,
Went Wyde in thys world | Wonders to heare, &amp;c."


So that the author of this poem will not be found to
have invented any new mode of versification, as
some have supposed, but only to have retained that
of the old Saxon and Gothic poets; which was probably
never wholly laid aside, but occasionally used
at different intervals: though the ravages of time will
not suffer us now to produce a regular series of poems
entirely written in it.

There are some readers whom it may gratify to
mention, that these Visions of Pierce (i.e. Peter) the
Plowman, are attributed to Robert Langland, a
secular priest, born at Mortimer's Cleobury in Shropshire,
and fellow of Oriel College in Oxford, who
flourished in the reigns of Edward III. and Richard
II., and published his poem a few years after 1350.
It consists of xx. passus or breaks[888], exhibiting
a series of visions which, he pretends, happened to
him on Malvern hills in Worcestershire. The author
excells in strong allegoric painting, and has with
great humour, spirit, and fancy, censured most of the
vices incident to the several professions of life; but
he particularly inveighs against the corruptions of
the clergy, and the absurdities of superstition. Of
this work I have now before me four different
editions in black-letter quarto. Three of them are
printed in 1550, "by Robert Crowley, dwelling in Elye
[Pg 382]Rentes in Holburne." It is remarkable that two of
these are mentioned in the title-page as both of the
second impression, though they contain evident
variations in every page[889]. The other is said to
be "newlye imprynted after the authors olde copy ...
by Owen Rogers," Feb. 21, 1561.

As Langland was not the first, so neither was he
the last that used this alliterative species of versification.
To Rogers's edition of the Visions is subjoined
a poem, which was probably writ in imitation
of them, intitled Pierce the Ploughman's Crede. It
begins thus:


"Cros, and Curteis Christ, this beginning spede
For the Faders Frendshipe, that Fourmed heaven,
And through the Special Spirit, that Sprong of hem tweyne,
And al in one godhed endles dwelleth."


The author feigns himself ignorant of his Creed, to
be instructed in which he applies to the four religious
orders, viz., the gray friers of St. Francis, the black
friers of St. Dominic, the Carmelites or white friers,
and the Augustines. This affords him occasion to describe
in very lively colours the sloth, ignorance, and
immorality of those reverend drones. At length he
meets with Pierce, a poor ploughman, who resolves
his doubts, and instructs him in the principles of
true religion. The author was evidently a follower
of Wiccliff, whom he mentions (with honour) as no
longer living[890]. Now that reformer died in 1384.
How long after his death this poem was written,
does not appear.

[Pg 383]

In the Cotton library is a volume of ancient English
poems[891], two of which are written in this
alliterative metre, and have the division of the lines
into distichs distinctly marked by a point, as is usual
in old poetical MSS. That which stands first of the
two (though perhaps the latest written) is entitled
The Sege of I'erlam, (i.e. Jerusalem), being an old
fabulous legend composed by some monk, and stuffed
with marvellous figments concerning the destruction
of the holy city and temple. It begins thus:


"In Tyberius Tyme. the Trewe emperour
Syr Sesar hymself. beSted in Rome
Whyll Pylat was Provoste. under that Prynce ryche
And Jewes Justice also. of Judeas londe
Herode under empere. as Herytage wolde
Kyng, &amp;c."


The other is intitled Chevalere Assigne (or De
Cigne), that is, The Knight of the Swan, being an
ancient Romance, beginning thus:


"All-Weldynge God. Whene it is his Wylle
Wele he Wereth his Werke. With his owene honde
For ofte Harmes were Hente. that Helpe we ne my&#541;te
Nere the Hy&#541;nes of Hym. that lengeth in Hevene
For this, &amp;c."


Among Mr. Garrick's collection of old plays[892] is a
prose narrative of the adventures of this same Knight
of the Swan, "newly translated out of Frenshe
into Englyshe, at thinstigacion of the puyssaunt and
illustryous prynce, lorde Edward duke of Buckynghame."
This lord it seems had a peculiar interest
in the book, for, in the preface, the translator tells us,
that this "highe dygne and illustryous prynce my
lorde Edwarde by the grace of god Duke of Buckyngham,
erle of Hereforde, Stafforde, and Northampton,
desyrynge cotydyally to encrease and
[Pg 384]augment the name and fame of such as were relucent
in vertuous feates and triumphaunt actes of chyvalry,
and to encourage and styre every lusty and gentell
herte by the exemplyficacyon of the same, havyng a
goodli booke of the highe and miraculous histori of
a famous and puyssaunt kynge, named Oryant,
sometime reynynge in the parties of beyonde the
sea, havynge to his wife a noble lady; of whome she
conceyved sixe sonnes and a daughter, and chylded
of them at one only time; at whose byrthe echone of
them had a chayne of sylver at their neckes, the
whiche were all tourned by the provydence of god
into whyte swannes, save one, of the whiche this
present hystory is compyled, named Helyas, the
knight of the swanne, of whome linially is dyscended
my sayde lorde. The whiche ententifly to have the
sayde hystory more amply and unyversally knowen
in thys hys natif countrie, as it is in other, hath of
hys hie bountie by some of his faithful and trusti
servauntes cohorted mi mayster Wynkin de Worde[893]
to put the said vertuous hystori in prynte ...
at whose instigacion and stiring I (Roberte Copland)
have me applied, moiening the helpe of god, to
reduce and translate it into our maternal and vulgare
english tonge after the capacit&egrave; and rudenesse of my
weke entendement." A curious picture of the times!
While in Italy literature and the fine arts were ready
to burst forth with classical splendor under Leo X.
the first peer of this realm was proud to derive his
pedigree from a fabulous knight of the swan[894]!

[Pg 385]

To return to the metre of Pierce Plowman: In
the folio MS. so often quoted in these volumes, are
two poems written in that species of versification.
One of these is an ancient allegorical poem intitled
Death and Life, (in 2 fitts or parts, containing 458
distichs) which, for ought that appears, may have
been written as early, if not before, the time of
Langland. The first forty lines are broke as they
should be into distichs, a distinction that is neglected
in the remaining part of the transcript, in order, I
suppose, to save room. It begins:


"Christ Christen king,
that on the Crosse tholed;
Hadd Paines and Passyons
to defend our soules;
Give us Grace on the Ground
the Greatlye to serve,
For that Royall Red blood
that Rann from thy side."


The subject of this piece is a vision, wherein the
poet sees a contest for superiority between "our
lady Dame Life," and the "ugly fiend Dame Death;"
who with their several attributes and concomitants
are personified in a fine vein of allegoric painting.
Part of the description of Dame Life is:


"Shee was Brighter of her Blee,
then was the Bright sonn:
Her Rudd Redder then the Rose,
that on the Rise hangeth:
Meekely smiling with her Mouth,
And Merry in her lookes;
Ever Laughing for Love,
as shee Like would.
And as shee came by the Bankes,
the Boughes eche one
They Lowted to that Ladye,
and Layd forth their branches;
Blossomes, and Burgens
Breathed full sweete;[Pg 386]
Flowers Flourished in the Frith,
where shee Forth stepped;
And the Grasse, that was Gray,
Greened belive."


Death is afterwards sketched out with a no less bold
and original pencil.

The other poem is that which is quoted in the 32nd
page of this volume, and which was probably the last
that was ever written in this kind of metre in its original
simplicity unaccompanied with rhyme. It
should have been observed above in page 32, that in
this poem the lines are throughout divided into distichs,
thus:


"Grant Gracious God,
Grant me this time," &amp;c.


It is intitled Scottish Feilde (in 2 fitts, 420 distichs,)
containing a very circumstantial narrative of the battle
of Flodden, fought Sept. 9, 1513: at which the author
seems to have been present from his speaking in the
first person plural:


"Then we Tild downe our Tents,
that Told were a thousand."


In the conclusion of the poem he gives this account
of himself:


"He was a Gentleman by Jesu,
that this Gest[895] made:
Which Say but as he Sayd[896]
for Sooth and noe other.
At Bagily that Bearne
his Biding place had;
And his ancestors of old time
have yearded[897] theire longe,
Before William Conquerour
this Cuntry did inhabitt.
Jesus Bring 'them'[898] to Blisse,[Pg 387]
that Brought us forth of Bale,
That hath Hearkned me Heare
or Heard my tale."


The village of Bagily or Baguleigh is in Cheshire,
and had belonged to the ancient family of Legh for
two centuries before the battle of Flodden. Indeed
that the author was of that county appears from
other passages in the body of the poem, particularly
from the pains he takes to wipe off a stain
from the Cheshiremen, who it seems ran away in
that battle, and from his encomiums on the Stanleys,
earls of Derby, who usually headed that county.
He laments the death of James Stanley, bishop of
Ely, as what had recently happened when this poem
was written; which serves to ascertain its date, for
that prelate died March 22, 1514-5.

Thus have we traced the alliterative measure so
low as the sixteenth century. It is remarkable that
all such poets as used this kind of metre, retained
along with it many peculiar Saxon idioms, particularly
such as were appropriated to poetry: this deserves
the attention of those who are desirous to
recover the laws of the ancient Saxon poesy, usually
given up as inexplicable: I am of opinion that they
will find what they seek in the metre of Pierce
Plowman[899].

About the beginning of the sixteenth century this
kind of versification began to change its form: the
author of Scottish Field, we see, concludes his poem
with a couplet in rhyme: this was an innovation that
did but prepare the way for the general admission of
[Pg 388]that more modish ornament; till at length the old
uncouth verse of the ancient writers would no longer
go down without it. Yet when rhyme began to be
superadded, all the niceties of alliteration were at first
retained along with it; and the song of Little John
Nobody exhibits this union very clearly. By degrees
the correspondence of final sounds engrossing the
whole attention of the poet, and fully satisfying the
reader, the internal imbellishment of alliteration was
no longer studied, and thus was this kind of metre at
length swallowed up and lost in our common burlesque
Alexandrine, or Anapestic verse[900], now never used
but in ballads and pieces of light humour, as in the
song of Conscience, and in that well-known doggerel,


"A cobler there was, and he lived in a stall."


But although this kind of measure hath with us
been thus degraded, it still retains among the French
[Pg 389]its ancient dignity; their grand heroic verse of twelve
syllables[901] is the same genuine offspring of the old
alliterative metre of the ancient Gothic and Francic
poets, stript like our Anapestic of its alliteration, and
ornamented with rhyme: but with this difference, that
whereas this kind of verse hath been applied by us
only to light and trivial subjects, to which by its
quick and lively measure it seemed best adapted, our
poets have let it remain in a more lax unconfined
state[902], as a greater degree of severity and strictness
would have been inconsistent with the light and airy
subjects to which they have applied it. On the other
hand, the French having retained this verse as the
vehicle of their epic and tragic flights, in order to
give it a stateliness and dignity were obliged to confine
it to more exact laws of scansion: they have
therefore limited it to the number of twelve syllables;
and by making the c&aelig;sura or pause as full and
[Pg 390]distinct as possible, and by other severe restrictions,
have given it all the solemnity of which it was capable.
The harmony of both however depends so much on
the same flow of cadence and disposal of the pause,
that they appear plainly to be of the same original;
and every French heroic verse evidently consists of
the ancient distich of their Francic ancestors: which,
by the way, will account to us why this verse of the
French so naturally resolves itself into two complete
hemistics. And indeed by making the c&aelig;sura or
pause always to rest on the last syllable of a word,
and by making a kind of pause in the sense, the
French poets do in effect reduce their hemistics to
two distinct and independent verses: and some of
their old poets have gone so far as to make the two
hemistics rhyme to each other.[903]

After all, the old alliterative and anapestic metre
of the English poets being chiefly used in a barbarous
age, and in a rude unpolished language, abounds with
verses defective in length, proportion, and harmony;
and therefore cannot enter into a comparison with
the correct versification of the best modern French
writers; but making allowances for these defects, that
sort of metre runs with a cadence so exactly resembling
the French heroic Alexandrine, that I
believe no peculiarities of their versification can be
produced, which cannot be exactly matched in the
alliterative metre. I shall give by way of example a
few lines from the modern French poets accommodated
with parallels from the ancient poem of Life
and Death; in these I shall denote the c&aelig;sura or
pause by a perpendicular line, and the cadence by the
marks of the Latin quantity.

To conclude: the metre of Pierce Plowman's Visions
has no kind of affinity with what is commonly called
blank verse; yet has it a sort of harmony of its own,
proceeding not so much from its alliteration, as from
the artful disposal of its cadence, and the contrivance
of its pause; so that when the ear is a little accustomed
to it, it is by no means unpleasing; but claims
all the merit of the French heroic numbers, only
far less polished; being sweetened, instead of their
final rhymes, with the internal recurrence of similar
sounds.

[Pg 392]






ADDITIONS TO THE ESSAY ON THE
ALLITERATIVE METRE.


  

Since the foregoing essay was first printed,
the Editor hath met with some additional
examples of the old alliterative metre.

The first is in MS.[907] which begins thus:


"Crist Crowned Kyng, that on Cros didest,[908]
And art Comfort of all Care, thow[909] kind go out of Cours,
With thi Halwes in Heven Heried mote thu be,
And thy Worshipful Werkes Worshiped evre,
That suche Sondry Signes Shewest unto man,
In Dremyng, in Drecchyng,[910] and in Derke swevenes."


The Author from this proemium takes occasion
to give an account of a dream that happened to himself:
which he introduces with the following circumstances:


"Ones y me Ordayned, as y have Ofte doon,
With Frendes, and Felawes, Frendemen, and other;
And Caught me in a Company on Corpus Christi even,
Six, other[911] Seven myle, oute of Suthampton,
To take Melodye, and Mirthes, among my Makes;
With Redyng of Romaunces, and Revelyng among,
The Dym of the Derknesse Drewe me into the west;
And beGon for to spryng in the Grey day.
Than Lift y up my Lyddes, and Loked in the sky,
And Knewe by the Kende Cours, hit clered in the est:
Blyve y Busked me down, and to Bed went,
For to Comforte my Kynde, and Cacche a slepe."


He then describes his dream:

[Pg 393]
"Methought that y Hoved on High on an Hill,
And loked Doun on a Dale Depest of othre;
Ther y Sawe in my Sighte a Selcouthe peple;
The Multitude was so Moche, it Mighte not be nombred:
Methoughte y herd a Crowned Kyng, of his Comunes axe
A Soleyne[912] Subsidie, to Susteyne his werres.
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *
With that a Clerk Kneled adowne and Carped these wordes,
Liege Lord, yif it you Like to Listen a while,
Som Sawes of Salomon y shall you shewe sone."


The writer then gives a solemn lecture to kings on
the art of governing. From the demand of subsidies
"to susteyne his werres," I am inclined to believe this
poem composed in the reign of K. Henry V., as the
MS. appears from a subsequent entry to have been
written before the 9th of Henry VI. The whole
poem contains but 146 lines.

The alliterative metre was no less popular among
the old Scottish poets, than with their brethren on this
side the Tweed. In Maitland's collection of ancient
Scottish poems, MS. in the Pepysian library, is a
very long poem in this species of versification, thus
inscribed:


"Heir begins the Tretis of the Twa Marriit Wemen, and the Wedo, compylit be Maister William Dunbar.[913]
Upon the Midsummer evven Mirriest of nichtis
I Muvit furth alane quhen as Midnight was past
Besyd ane Gudlie Grene Garth,[914] full of Gay flouris
Hegeit[915] of ane Huge Hicht with Hawthorne treeis
Quairon ane Bird on ane Bransche so Birst out hir notis
That nevir ane Blythfuller Bird was on the Beuche[916] hard &amp;c."


The Author pretends to overhear three gossips
sitting in an arbour, and revealing all their secret
[Pg 394]methods of alluring and governing the other sex; it
is a severe and humorous satire on bad women, and
nothing inferior to Chaucer's Prologue to his Wife of
Bath's Tale. As Dunbar lived till about the middle of
the sixteenth century, this poem was probably composed
after Scottish Field (described above in p. 384),
which is the latest specimen I have met with written in
England. This poem contains about five hundred
lines.

But the current use of the alliterative metre in
Scotland, appears more particularly from those popular
vulgar prophecies, which are still printed for
the use of the lower people in Scotland, under the
names of Thomas the Rymer, Marvellous Merling,
&amp;c. This collection seems to have been put together
after the accession of James I. to the crown of England,
and most of the pieces in it are in the metre of
Pierce Plowman's Visions, The first of them begins
thus:


"Merling sayes in his book, who will Read Right,
Although his Sayings be uncouth, they Shall be true found.
In the seventh chapter, read Whoso Will,
One thousand and more after Christ's birth, &amp;c."


And the prophesie of Beid:


"Betwixt the chief of Summer and the Sad winter;
Before the Heat of summer Happen shall a war
That Europ's lands Earnestly shall be wrought
And Earnest Envy shall last but a while, &amp;c."


So again the prophesie of Berlington:


"When the Ruby is Raised, Rest is there none,
But much Rancour shall Rise in River and plain
Much Sorrow is Seen through a Suth-hound
That beares Hornes in his Head like a wyld Hart, &amp;c."


In like metre is the prophesie of Waldhave:

[Pg 395]


"Upon Lowdon Law alone as I Lay,
Looking to the Lennox, as me Lief thought,
The first Morning of May, Medicine to seek
For Malice and Melody that Moved me sore, &amp;c."


And lastly, that intitled the prophesie of Gildas:


"When holy kirk is Wracked and Will has no Wit
And Pastors are Pluckt, and Pil'd without Pity
When Idolatry Is In ens and re
And spiritual pastours are vexed away, &amp;c."


It will be observed in the foregoing specimens,
that the alliteration is extremely neglected, except in
the third and fourth instances; although all the rest
are written in imitation of the cadence used in this
kind of metre. It may perhaps appear from an attentive
perusal, that the poems ascribed to Berlington
and Waldhave are more ancient than the others:
indeed the first and fifth appear evidently to have
been new modelled, if not intirely composed about
the beginning of the last century, and are probably
the latest attempts ever made in this species of verse.

In this and the foregoing essay are mentioned all
the specimens I have met with of the alliterative
metre without rhyme: but instances occur sometimes
in old manuscripts, of poems written both with
final rhymes and the internal cadence and alliterations
of the metre of Pierce Plowman.

This Essay will receive illustration from another
specimen in Warton's History of English Poetry,
vol. i. p. 309, being the fragment of a MS. poem on
the subject of Alexander the Great, in the Bodleian
Library, which he supposes to be the same with No.
44 in the Ashmol. MSS. containing twenty-seven
passus, and beginning thus:


"Whener folk fastid [feasted, qu.] and fed, fayne wolde thei her [i.e. hear]
Some farand thing, &amp;c."

[Pg 396]
It is well observed by Mr. Tyrwhitt on Chaucer's
sneer at this old alliterative metre (vol. iii. p. 305),
viz.:


"&mdash;&mdash;I am a Sotherne [i.e. Southern] man,
I cannot geste, rom, ram, raf, by my letter,"


that the fondness for this species of versification, &amp;c.
was retained longest in the northern provinces: and
that the author of Pierce Plowman's Visions is in the
best MSS. called William, without any surname.
See vol. iv. p. 74.





[The Rev. Walter W. Skeat, editor of Piers Plowman, for the
Early English Text Society, has written An Essay on Alliterative
Poetry, for Hales and Furnivall's edition of the Percy folio MS.,
which will be found in the third volume of that work (pp. xi.-xxxix.).
He gives a list of all the poems he has met with that have been
written as alliterative, yet without rhyme, since the Conquest, and
ends his essay with the following note:&mdash;"The reader must be
warned against three extraordinary mis-statements in this (Percy's)
essay, following close upon one another near the end of it. These
are (1) that Robert of Gloucester wrote in anap&aelig;stic verse, whereas
he wrote in the long Alexandrine verse, containing (when perfect)
six Returns; (2) that the French alone have retained this old
Gothic metre [the twelve-syllabled Alexandrine] for their serious
poems, whereas we may be sure that Michael Drayton, the author
of the Polyolbion, meant his poem seriously; and (3) that the
cadence of Piers Plowman 'so exactly resembles the French
Alexandrine, that I believe no peculiarities of their versification
can be produced which cannot be exactly matched in the alliterative
metre.' This is indeed a curious craze, for the alliterative
metre is founded on Dominants, the Alexandrine on Returns.
Percy gives some examples, and the metre which he selects for
numbering is the French one, as the reader may easily judge for
himself when he finds that the line


"L&#277; s&#365;cc&#275;s f&#365;t to&#365;jo&#363;rs | &#365;n &#277;nf&#257;nt d&#277; l'a&#365;d&#257;ce"


is marked by him as it is marked here, and is supposed to consist
of four Anap&aelig;sts! Yet one more blunder to be laid at the door
of the 'Anap&aelig;sts!' Would that we were well rid of them, and
that the 'longs' and 'shorts' were buried beside them."]

[900] Consisting of four Anapests (&#728; &#728; &macr;) in which the accent
rests upon every third syllable. This kind of verse, which I also
call the burlesque Alexandrine (to distinguish it from the other
Alexandrines of eleven and fourteen syllables, the parents of our
lyric measure: see examples, pp. 151, 152, &amp;c.), was early applied
by Robert of Gloucester to serious subjects. That writer's metre,
like this of Langland's, is formed on the Saxon models (each verse
of his containing a Saxon distich), only instead of the internal
alliterations adopted by Langland, he rather chose final rhymes, as
the French poets have done since. Take a specimen:



"The Saxons tho in ther power, tho thii were so rive,
Seve kingdoms made in Engelonde, and suthe but vive:
The king of Northomberlond, and of Eastangle also,
Of Kent, and of Westsex, and of the March, therto."



Robert of Gloucester wrote in the western dialect, and his language
differs exceedingly from that of other contemporary writers, who
resided in the metropolis, or in the midland counties. Had the
Heptarchy continued, our English language would probably have
been as much distinguished for its different dialects as the Greek;
or at least as that of the several independent states of Italy.



[901] Or of thirteen syllables, in what they call a feminine verse.
It is remarkable that the French alone have retained this old Gothic
metre for their serious poems; while the English, Spaniards, &amp;c.
have adopted the Italic verse of ten syllables, although the Spaniards,
as well as we, anciently used a short-lined metre. I believe
the success with which Petrarch, and perhaps one or two
others, first used the heroic verse of ten syllables in Italian poesy,
recommended it to the Spanish writers; as it also did to our
Chaucer, who first attempted it in English; and to his successors
Lord Surrey, Sir Thomas Wyat, &amp;c.; who afterwards improved it
and brought it to perfection. To Lord Surrey we also owe the first
introduction of blank verse in his versions of the second and
fourth Books of the &AElig;neid, 1557, 4to.



[902] Thus our poets use this verse indifferently with twelve,
eleven, and even ten syllables. For though regularly it consists
of four Anapests (&#728; &#728; &macr;) or twelve syllables, yet they frequently
retrench a syllable from the first or third Anapest; and sometimes
from both; as in these instances from Prior, and from the Song
of Conscience:



"Wh&#335; h&#259;s e&#275;r be&#277;n &#259;t P&#257;r&#301;s, m&#365;st n&#275;eds kn&#335;w th&#277; Gr&#275;ve,

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
