THE OLDEN-TIME SERIES.

16mo. Per vol., 50 cents.



There appears to be, from year to year, a growing popular taste for
quaint and curious reminiscences of "Ye Olden Time," and to meet this,
Mr. Henry M. Brooks has prepared a series of interesting handbooks. The
materials have been gleaned chiefly from old newspapers of Boston and
Salem, sources not easily accessible, and while not professing to be
history, the volumes contain much material for history, so combined and
presented as to be both amusing and instructive. The titles of some of
the volumes indicate their scope and their promise of entertainment:&mdash;


Curiosities of the Old Lottery.
Days of the Spinning-Wheel.
Some Strange and Curious Punishments.
Quaint and Curious Advertisements.
Literary Curiosities.
New-England Sunday, etc.




"It has been the good fortune of the writer to be allowed a peep at the
manuscript for this series, and he can assure the lovers of the
historical and the quaint in literature that something both valuable and
pleasant is in store for them. In the specialties treated of in these
books Mr. Brooks has been for many years a careful collector and
student, and it is gratifying to learn that the material is to be
committed to book form."&mdash;Salem Gazette.

"To say that the past is of no importance, unworthy of a moment's
regard, because it has gone by, and is no longer anything, is an
argument that cannot be held to any purpose; for if the past has ceased
to be, and is therefore to be accounted nothing in the scale of good or
evil, the future is yet to come, and has never been
anything."&mdash;Hazlitt.




"In my young days, when I was leetle,
The only steam came from the kettle.

....

"The Gals on good old Dobbins rid then,
But folks don't do as they used to did then.

....

"Heigho! I grieve, I grieve
For the good old days of Adam and Eve."


From Henry J. Finn's "Good Old Times,"

October, 1827.

THE DAYS OF THE SPINNING-WHEEL

IN NEW ENGLAND.

Within the last few years many young ladies have searched country houses
or ransacked old garrets to find spinning-wheels, which, like old
chairs, tall clocks, and warming-pans, have now become objects of
curiosity and interest to those who take a fancy to antique articles. It
has become fashionable to have these things to adorn our Queen Anne
houses. And brass andirons and shovels and tongs have come into request,
so that we may enjoy the luxury of an open wood fire, which, to our
mind, is one of the most cheerful things in this world. Some one has
remarked "that to be well-dressed gives a feeling of satisfaction[Pg 2] that
religion fails to give;" but to us, to sit before a blazing wood fire on
a dull, cold evening, gives a feeling of comfort and delight which
surpasses anything we know of. What charming companionship in a wood
fire! Better than the company of uncongenial persons.


"Old wood to burn,"
"Old books to read:"


these are enough; we will leave out the "old wine to drink."


"This bright wood fire,
So like to that which warmed and lit
My youthful days, how doth it flit
Back on the periods nigher!
Re-lighting and re-warming with its glow
The bright scenes of my youth,&mdash;all gone out now."


Glance backward to some years before the Revolution, and we shall find a
spinning-wheel in every house, and then, probably, in constant use. Now
its place in our homes is taken by the piano. This instrument had not
then come into use. Something resembling it,&mdash;namely, the spinnet or the
harpsichord,&mdash;was to be found in some instances; but it was by no means
common to find these, for there was but little knowledge of music in
America in[Pg 3] those days. A hundred years ago, only one or two churches in
Boston had organs, and the public taste, except in rare cases, was
decidedly against music of all kinds, especially sacred music. To show
how this was, we have heard an old lady say that when she was young,
some eighty years or so ago, "musicians, for the most part, were not
thought much of" by the most cultivated people of that time; and she
assured me that even at a later date, members of military bands, as well
as organists and violinists (then called fiddlers) were too often low
characters and men much addicted to drinking. The times were too hard
for the New England people of those days to cultivate music or indulge
in entertainments of any kind except "going to meeting." There was but
little money in circulation, and that was almost always in the form of a
depreciated currency. Gold and silver were scarce articles, and a large
proportion of the necessities of life and luxuries&mdash;if luxuries they
could be called; they would hardly be so considered by us&mdash;were imported
from England or elsewhere. The leading occupations were farming,
fishing, making New England[Pg 4] rum, importing rum, sugar, and molasses
from the West Indies, and dry goods from England. The common people were
poor enough, in comparison with the condition of the same class at the
present time, when they make as good an appearance as the wealthy did a
hundred years ago. It would be safe to say that they have more comforts
and conveniences in their homes to-day than the more prosperous had at
the time of the Revolution. The humorist, John Phenix, said that "Gen'l
Washington never saw a steamboat, nor rode in a railroad car;" and
possibly his house was not heated by steam, or furnished with pipes for
hot and cold water. Nor did he ever use gas, or the telegraph or
telephone. Whether the people who lived then would have shown the
extravagance which characterizes our time if they had possessed the
means, is a question not easily to be answered; but it is certain they
were more frugal than we are, if not more industrious. The Revolution
left the masses of the people in rather a destitute condition, and they
were forced to be economical. Their habits were so entirely different
from modern habits that it would exceed our limits to undertake[Pg 5] to draw
a careful comparison. It is said that the people of those days bewailed
the degeneracy of the times, and spoke of the industry and frugality of
earlier periods.

NORWICH, May 6, 1784.

A corre&#383;pondent ob&#383;erves, that the extravagances of the
pre&#383;ent day are fully demon&#383;trated in the broadcloth
coats and &#383;ilk gowns,&mdash;the powder and feathers, the
ruffles and cardinals, the &#383;ilk &#383;tockings and feet
trappings&mdash;In the fea&#383;ts, the dancing parties and &#383;elect
companies&mdash;and what is the more melancholy, all orders and
degrees help form the circle.&mdash;Where is the &#383;implicity in
dre&#383;s and manners; temperance in meats and drinks, which
formed the virtuous characters of our illu&#383;trious
ance&#383;tors?&mdash;O! the degeneracy of the times!

Salem Gazette.

Just as our ancestors did, as Macaulay says, in the days of Charles the
First; they thought they were not as good as their ancestors had been.
This habit of looking back to a time so remote that "distance lends
enchantment to the view," seems to be almost universal. It is this
feeling of reverence for the old that makes it so interesting to us, and
leads us to look at things of the past poetically rather than[Pg 6]
practically; although it is true that sometimes the interest taken in
inconvenient and uncomfortable articles arises rather from their age
than from anything else. But oftentimes the very simplicity, solidity,
and strength of old furniture, for instance, is charming, in contrast
with the elaborate, unmeaning carvings and flimsy character of more
modern productions. We are beginning to see how much more sensible the
Chippendale and other styles commended by Eastlake and some other
writers on household art are to much that has been produced in later
times. Yet we must allow that prejudice and fashion go a great way in
determining our likes and dislikes, in furniture as well as in dress and
other things. Very likely in a few years we shall tire of the Queen Anne
houses and furniture, and hard floors, and have a surfeit of
Anglomania, especially if we carry the taste too far. In this country,
as Emerson says, "Every rider drives too fast." It is hard to be simple
and slow. We must build fast, eat fast, and live fast. But Emerson says
again, "Nature has no respect for haste." Herbert Spencer has given us
in a[Pg 7] kindly spirit some hints on this score which it would be well to
heed. But we are wandering from our immediate subject. Our desire is to
illustrate, in the very words of the people of the period we refer to,
the views they entertained of economy and industry, and how they carried
them out. We will begin, then, in the year 1759, with a curious letter
to the "Boston Gazette" of June 11 of that year, in which the writer
gives some account of the cost of provisions at that period.

To the Trading and Farming People of New England.

Gentlemen.

I Have been coming and going among you &#383;ince the Year
1745. I am now once more on Service in this Part of the
World, and not a little &#383;urprized at the Alteration in the
Value of your Provi&#383;ions, &#383;ince my Knowledge of your
Country. When I fir&#383;t came among you, I could have bought
a Pound of Beef for a Penny, a Goo&#383;e for a Shilling, a
Fowl for three Pence, and &#383;o in Proportion. It now is, I
think, four Pence Sterling for a Pound of Beef, eighteen
Pence Sterling for a Fowl, and three Shillings for a
Goo&#383;e. Pray Gentlemen, when that is the Price at
Bo&#383;ton, what mu&#383;t we pay for it at Louisbourg, after
it has gone thro' the Hands of many different People that
are to live out of it. Our Pay is not increa&#383;ed.[Pg 8]

I would &#383;ay nothing to influence you to &#383;ell cheaper,
from Motives di&#383;intere&#383;ted or publick &#383;pirited, as
that weighs but little with the Generality of Mankind. But
con&#383;ider your own Intere&#383;t, the War can la&#383;t but
little longer: This Campaign, in all Probability, will put
an End to it, then where will you find a Market for your
Stock you rai&#383;e. Con&#383;ider with the Fall of this
pre&#383;ent Summer, its pretty certain the Soldiers and Seamen
at pre&#383;ent employed for your Defence, will be called to
Britain: Take the Market while it holds Gentlemen. We have
Beef found us, that is to &#383;ay, the Publick purcha&#383;es it;
let us now and then ta&#383;te of your Veal, Mutton and Fowls
for our Money, and we will &#383;pend all among you; and we
expect both Intere&#383;t and Inclination will prompt you to
give us an ample Supply.

I am your Friend, An ANTI-CANADIAN.



In the same paper is an auction advertisement, showing how they mixed
the different kinds of property.

To be Sold by publick Vendue on Scarlet's Wharff, at the
North End of Bo&#383;ton, THIS AFTERNOON, at IV o'Clock,
Sundry Hog&#383;heads of Sugar, four likely Negro Men, and a
Parcel of old Copper; Prize Goods lately brought into this
Port.

[Pg 9]

On the 19th November we are shown how remittances were made in those
days.

We hear that the Trea&#383;urer of this Province has received a
Bill of Lading for two Boxes of Portugal Gold, &#383;hip'd by
Mr. Agent Bollan, on board the Mercury Man of War, amounting
to Twenty thou&#383;and &#383;ix hundred and eighty Pounds,
&#383;eventeen &#383;hillings and &#383;ix Pence; being Part of the
&pound;27,000 granted by Parliament in 1757, to this Province, to
recompence them for the Expences they were at in the
Expedition in 1756.&mdash;Said Ship may be daily expected.



And here is a description of a vessel of the time.

Mr. James Hud&#383;on came Pa&#383;&#383;enger in the Ve&#383;&#383;el that
arriv'd at Cape-Ann, mention'd in our la&#383;t, which &#383;aw a
Wreck in Lat: 36, he &#383;ays, &#383;he was a Frigate built Ship
of about 200 Tons burthen, had a Lion Head painted yellow, a
&#383;hort Topgal on Quarter-Deck, a &#383;mall Tafrail painted
yellow, Quarters and Stern painted blue, had a large
Trophies painted on her Stern and gilt, full of Water, and
no living Per&#383;on on board.



On the 5th February in that year, this was the way they advertised for
recruits for the Government[Pg 10] service, offering among other inducements,
"a Crown to drink the King's health."

All able-bodied fit Men that have an Inclination to &#383;erve
His Maje&#383;ty King GEORGE the Second, in the fir&#383;t
Independent Company of Rangers, now in the Province of
Nova-Scotia, commanded by Jo&#383;eph Gorham, E&#383;q;
&#383;hall, on inli&#383;ting, receive good Pay and Cloathing, a
large Bounty, with a Crown to drink the King's Health. And
by repairing to the Sign of the Bear in King-Street,
Bo&#383;ton, and to Mr. Cornelius Crocker, Innholder in
Barn&#383;table, may hear the particular Encouragement, and
many Advantages accruing to a Soldier, in the Cour&#383;e of
the Duty of that Company, too long to in&#383;ert here; and
further, may depend on being di&#383;charged at the Expiration
of the Time entertained for, and to have every other
Encouragement punctually compli'd with.



There was a meeting of "very agreeable Ladies" in the interests of
economy about the same time.

In a large Circle of very agreeable Ladies in this Town, it
was unanimou&#383;ly agreed to lay a&#383;ide the U&#383;e of
Ribbons, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. for which there has been &#383;o great a
Re&#383;ort to Milliners in times pa&#383;t&mdash;&mdash;It is hoped that
this Re&#383;olution will be followed by others of the Sex
throughout the Province&mdash;How[Pg 11] agreeable will they appear in
their native Beauty, &#383;tript of the&#383;e Ornaments, from the
prevailing Motive of Love to their Country.

We mu&#383;t after all our Efforts, depend greatly upon the
Female Sex for the Introduction of Oeconomy among us: And
tho&#383;e who have the Plea&#383;ure of an Acquaintance with
them, a&#383;&#383;ure us that their utmo&#383;t Aid will not be
wanting.

So &#383;trong is the Di&#383;po&#383;ition of the Inhabitants of
this Town to take off the Manufactures that come from the
Country Towns, e&#383;pecially Womens and Childrens Winter
Apparel, that nothing is wanting but an Adverti&#383;ement
where they may be had in Town, which will be taken in, and
publi&#383;hed by the Printers of this Paper Gratis.



Labrador tea began to take the place of green and bohea.

Me&#383;&#383;ieurs Edes &amp; Gill,

The u&#383;e of Hyperion or Labradore Tea, is every day
coming into more general vogue among people of all ranks.
The virtues of the plant or &#383;hrub from which this delicate
Tea is gathered, were fir&#383;t di&#383;covered by the
Aborigines, and from them the Canadians learned them. It
&#383;oon became into &#383;uch repute that quantities were &#383;ent
to France, where I have heard &#383;ay, it was &#383;oon in
&#383;uch demand, as alarmed the French Ea&#383;t-India company,
and procured[Pg 12] an ordinance prohibiting the importation of
any more on the pain of death. So little do &#383;ome
politicians regard the health or even the life of man, when
either of them appear to be incompatible with their
particular intere&#383;ts, views and projects. Before the
ce&#383;&#383;ion of Canada to Great-Britain, we knew little or
nothing of this mo&#383;t excellent herb: but &#383;ince that we
have been taught to find it growing on every hill and dale,
between the Lat. 40 &amp; 60. It is to be found all over
New-England in great plenty, and that of the be&#383;t quality,
particularly on the banks of Penob&#383;cot, Kennebeck,
Nichewannock and Merrimac. Immen&#383;e quantities may be
found on the mountains near the great lakes.

Nothing &#383;hort of the highe&#383;t degree of infatuation and
madne&#383;s could ever have prevailed with us to introduce
unwhole&#383;ome Exoticks. The voice of rea&#383;on crys louder
than ever for their perpetual bani&#383;hment; and the further
u&#383;e of them mu&#383;t be accounted for but by the force of
invincible prejudice. This indeed &#383;ometimes leads to a
preference of rank poi&#383;on if far fetched and dear bought,
to the mo&#383;t &#383;alubrious draught at hand, with little
pains or co&#383;t, tho' of ine&#383;timable value.

A Tea-Drinker.



The following items, Sept. 17, 1759, throw some light on the state of
the country in some[Pg 13] parts of New England, where, even if the "Lyons"
once seen at Cape Ann by Wood had departed, there were still some bears,
one having been seen within two miles of Boston.

We hear from Brentwood, in New Hamp&#383;hire Government, as
two Children were gathering Beans in a Field, a large Bear
came upon them and kill'd them both;&mdash;The Bear was
pur&#383;ued, but could not be found.

Al&#383;o from Che&#383;ter, in the &#383;ame Government, that a few
Days after the above, another Bear came behind a Woman as
&#383;he was walking along, not far from her Hou&#383;e, and tore
off the hind Part of her Gown, which he carried off in his
Mouth;&mdash;but the Woman happily made her E&#383;cape from him.

And from King&#383;ton, in the County of Worce&#383;ter, we hear,
that on Tue&#383;day la&#383;t as Mr. Stephen Clark of that Town
was out a Hunting after Bears, his Next Door Neighbour went
out into his Cornfield ju&#383;t at Evening, and &#383;eeing
&#383;omething move which he thought was one of tho&#383;e
Animals, &#383;hott at it, and upon his coming to the place,
found it to be Mr. Clark as above-mention'd, &#383;hot thro'
his Head, to his great &#383;urprize.

We hear from Kittery, that in about 13 Days pa&#383;t, &#383;even
large Bears have been kill'd within a Mile of the Rev. Mr.
Rogers's Meeting Hou&#383;e.

It is &#383;aid &#383;ome of the&#383;e voracious Animals have
ventured down even to &#383;ome of the Seaport Towns[Pg 14] at the
Ea&#383;tward.&mdash;Two of them were &#383;een at Medford la&#383;t Week;
and one of them has been lately killed within two Miles of
this Metropolis. Some have weighed above 300 lb. Wt.

When we remember the present condition of the city of Lynn, it is
interesting to note how that place stood in reference to the shoe
industry in the year 1762. The "Boston Gazette" of November 2 says:[Pg 15]&mdash;

We are confidently told, that in the Town of Lynn upwards of
Forty Thou&#383;and Pair of Womens Shoes have been made in one
Year, equal in Goodne&#383;s to any imported from Abroad&mdash;It is
thought that in a few Years they will be &#383;upply'd with
Callimanco and other Stuffs manufactured in this Province.



The statement has often been made by connoisseurs that there was no
mahogany furniture in America before the Revolution; but this is a
mistake, for here, in the "Boston Gazette" of Feb. 5, 1759, is an
advertisement announcing the sale of a "Beautiful Mehogany Desk and
Book-Case." Probably this was an early specimen of such kind of work, as
mahogany, it is said, was not introduced into Europe long before this
time.

To be Sold by Mo&#383;es De&#383;hon,

On Dock-Square, Next Wedne&#383;day, at V o'Clock, in the
Afternoon, and Friday Evening following.

A Hand&#383;ome 8 Day Clock, a Bra&#383;s Grate, Shovel Fire,
Tongs, Tables, and a Variety of other Articles; a fine
A&#383;&#383;ortment of Engli&#383;h, Scotch, and French Goods. N.B.
A beautiful Mehogany De&#383;k and Book-Ca&#383;e; and a Quantity
of Cannon-Powder to di&#383;po&#383;e of at private Sale.

[Pg 16]

A curious advertisement of a runaway convict in Maryland appears in the
same paper, Sept. 15, 1759:&mdash;

Fifteen Pi&#383;toles Reward.

Ran-away from the Sub&#383;criber, (living at ANNAPOLIS, in
MARYLAND) in June la&#383;t, a Convict Servant Man, named
Thomas Read, alias Cutbert, about 25 or 30 Years of Age,
5 Feet, 4 Inches high, well &#383;et, grey Eyes, large No&#383;e,
and had &#383;hort brown curl'd Hair. He is &#383;uppo&#383;ed to be
in Bo&#383;ton, or &#383;ome of the Northern Governments; is a

In the year 1762 there appears to have been quite a stir in reference to
economy and home productions, and doubtless the spinning-wheels were
constantly in use. In the "Boston Gazette," November 2, is a very
curious letter of Henry Flynt, a noted teacher, addressed to the ladies
of North America.


To the LADIES of North America.

Ladies,

I am one of tho&#383;e who think it not only high Time but of
the la&#383;t Importance, that you &#383;hould be publickly
addre&#383;&#383;ed: And of the many ingenious Pens, which in the
Cour&#383;e of a few Years have informed and enlightened this
Country, I have often wi&#383;hed that at lea&#383;t &#383;ome one of
them had been more particularly devoted to your Service.
This would have agreeably prevented me in an attempt to
which I find my&#383;elf in all Re&#383;pects but too unequal. Yet
relying on your good Sen&#383;e and Candour, I venture to lay
at your Feet a few well-intended Sentiments, which tho' in a
plain home&#383;pun Garb, I hope will not offend. I am
convinced that at this pre&#383;ent it is not only in your
Inclination and Will, but al&#383;o in your Power, to effect
more in favour of your Country, than an Army of an Hundred
Thou&#383;and Men; and indeed more than all the armed Men on
this va&#383;t Continent.&mdash;Can a Woman forget her Ornaments?
Yes I know &#383;he can. Deborah once judged I&#383;rael, and
&#383;ome think it was never judged much[Pg 18] better afterwards.
But what tho't Deborah or Jael of their Ornaments, when
the one was contriving, &amp; the other driving the Nail that
would go? What tho't beautiful E&#383;ther of her Ornaments,
when tho&#383;e of her Kindred &amp; Hou&#383;hold were in immediate
and imminent Danger, by the Decree treacherou&#383;ly obtained
by Haman, from the mouth of her beloved and almo&#383;t
adored Lord Aha&#383;uerus the Great? What tho't Judith of
her Ornaments, when &#383;he was &#383;evering the Head of
Holofernes from his Body, or while flying with the Prize to
the Relief of her de&#383;pairing Friends? The Time would fail
me, were I to recount the wondrous Deeds and mighty
Atchievements of renowned and honorable Women in all Ages.

I have but alluded to a few In&#383;tances, among many of
divine Heroi&#383;m in your Sex, which hath often &#383;aved a
Country, when the dull ploding Wi&#383;dom of man has been
totally at a Plunge. How near we are to &#383;uch a Cri&#383;is,
is left to the Conjecture of others. It would be a little
out of Nature to expect the Birth and Exploits of Heroines
to take Place before tho&#383;e of Heroes. I believe we &#383;hall
be furni&#383;hed with both in their Order, as Occa&#383;ion may
require. All I think at pre&#383;ent that can be rea&#383;onably
expected or de&#383;ired of you, is to con&#383;ent to lay a&#383;ide
all &#383;uperfluous Ornaments for a Sea&#383;on&mdash;after which they
&#383;hall be &#383;urely returned to you again with
Intere&#383;ts.&mdash;You &#383;hall be cloathed in Purple, and
Scarlet, and Fine Linnen of our own, and with other glorious
Apparel; which, if po&#383;&#383;ible, &#383;hall add a Lu&#383;tre to
your native Charms.

HENRY FLYNT.

[Pg 19]

Newport, R.I., has the reputation of having been engaged in the
slave-trade before the Revolution; and the following item, in the
"Boston Gazette," June 30, 1762, noticing without comment the arrival of
a Guinea trader there, would seem to show it to have been not an
uncommon occurrence.

We hear from Newport, Rhode I&#383;land, That Capt. Carpenter
was arrived there from the Coa&#383;t of Guinea, having had 104
Days Pa&#383;&#383;age, ten Days whereof they were without Meat, but
had a Sufficiency of Rice and Corn. They lo&#383;t but &#383;ix
Slaves out of 69 they bro't out with them.



On the 5th of November "the gunpowder treason and plot" was formerly
pretty generally remembered,&mdash;by the boys, at least, who made bonfires
and burned tar-barrels. We believe the custom has fallen into disuse
except in Salem and Marblehead, where there seems to be a little
"Colonialism" left. As recently as 1885 the writer saw a bonfire in
honor of the occasion on a hill near the latter place. In 1762 there
must have been quite a demonstration, if we can judge anything[Pg 20] by a
vote of the town of Boston. Englishmen visiting us have sometimes
expressed astonishment at learning that this curious custom should still
be kept up here, while it had been abolished at home.

Upon a motion made, Voted, That the Town will take all
proper Mea&#383;ures, by keeping in their Children and
Servants, &amp; other Ways, to prevent the Di&#383;turbances which
have &#383;ometimes happened on or about the 5th Day of
November.

Atte&#383;t,
William Cooper, Town-Clerk.

Tue&#383;day la&#383;t (5th November) being the Anniver&#383;ary of
the happy Deliverance of the Briti&#383;h Nation from the
Popi&#383;h Powder Plot, at Noon the Guns at Ca&#383;tle William
and at the Batteries in this Town were fired: At One all the
nine Men of War then in this Harbour al&#383;o fired.

From the Essex Gazette, Nov. 12, 1771.

The accommodation offered for travel between Boston and New York before
the Revolution must have been slim enough, judging from an advertisement
in the "Boston[Pg 21] Gazette" in 1761. Passengers then went by vessel from
Providence; that is, "Gentlemen Passengers." Whether ladies were
accommodated or not, does not appear; but perhaps they were in the habit
of going by stage, taking a week or so to accomplish the journey, or,
more than likely, few ever travelled at all in those times. In our day,
when every one is on the move, it is hard to realize this state of
things.



Notice is Given, That SAMUEL and WILLIAM CHACE, of
Providence, have a &#383;uitable Ve&#383;&#383;el that goes &#383;teadily
between there and New-York. So that all Gentlemen
Pa&#383;&#383;engers and others that incline to take the Rout from
Boston to New-York, or from New-York to Boston, may
be well accommodated.

Providence, Aug. 29, 1761.

"In 1756," Watson says, "the first stage was started between
Philadelphia and New York by Mr. Butler; three days through in summer
time, five and six in winter. In 1765 a second stage was started, to go
through positively in three days. This was a covered[Pg 22] Jersey
wagon,&mdash;fare, twopence per mile. In 1766 another stage, called the
'Flying Machine,' was started, to go through in two days,&mdash;threepence
per mile."



A brief account of Montreal in the "Boston Gazette," March 30, 1761.

NEW-YORK, March 23.

Extract of a Letter from Montreal.

&mdash;&mdash;"The Ca&#383;e of the poor Canadians is really deplorable,
occa&#383;ioned by the bankruptcy of the crown of France. Many
of them who had, with great danger and labour, acquired
e&#383;tates worth 20,000&nbsp;l. &#383;terl. by the fur-trade, or
otherwi&#383;e, can now &#383;carce procure a dinner. All their
remittances from their mother country, con&#383;i&#383;ted in
bills on the French King, which are not now worth one
farthing, as no body whatever will accept of them in
payment. It is computed there is above the value of
3,000,000&nbsp;l. &#383;terling of the&#383;e u&#383;ele&#383;s paper
&#383;craps, circulated through the colony, which, as a reward
to the wretched inhabitants for all their hard&#383;hips and
fatigues, mu&#383;t now &#383;upply the place of affluence and
independence. Mo&#383;t, if not all of them, are perfectly
reconciled to the Briti&#383;h government, as they can now with
&#383;ecurity enjoy any little property they have; whereas
formerly, Governor Vaudreuil made no ceremony of &#383;eizing
the produce[Pg 23] of their lands, their merchandize and
manufactures of every kind, and after conveying them to the
King's &#383;tore hou&#383;es, paid to the proprietors any price
he plea&#383;ed. If the owners thereafter had occa&#383;ion for
any of their own commodities, they could not procure them
under twenty times the price they had received.

"Montreal in general is a well built town, but incapable of
any defence. The churches are elegant, and the hou&#383;es of
&#383;ome of their principal men are really magnificent; though
few in number. The Hotel Dieu is by far the fine&#383;t
ho&#383;pital I ever &#383;aw, every thing in it is extremely neat
and convenient.

"The people here are extravagantly fond of dre&#383;s; a
&#383;tranger would take Montreal to be a city inhabited by
none but the rich and idle: they are all finely powdered,
walk with their hats under their arms, and wear long coats,
adorned with tin&#383;el lace, and buttoned down to the
extremity. Since I came here, I have not &#383;een one man
dre&#383;&#383;ed like a trade&#383;man. The ladies in general are
hand&#383;ome, extremely gay, and well bred."



In 1767 the best soap and "dipt" and "mould" candles were sold at the
post-office in Boston, according to an advertisement in the "Gazette" of
October 26. The candles were made of tallow, and gave but little light,
requiring almost constant snuffing. Other kinds of[Pg 24] candles were not in
general use in New England in the last century. Sperm oil and sperm or
wax candles could be used only by the wealthy. Many families, for
economy, made their own candles. This practice was common in New England
down to within fifty years.

It will be recollected that Dr. Franklin's father was a tallow-chandler
in Boston, and that the Doctor himself worked at the business when a
boy. Elizabeth Franklin, whose name appears in the following
advertisement, was probably a relative of the family.





SOLD BY
Elizabeth Franklin,
At the Po&#383;t-Office,


The best true Crown Soap, Alicant be&#383;t hard Soap, by the
Doz. or &#383;ingle Pound, dipt and mould Candles at the
lowe&#383;t Price.



Every week the burials and baptisms in Boston were thus inserted in the
papers. The following is from the "Gazette" of Nov. 23, 1767:[Pg 25]&mdash;

Buried in the Town of Bo&#383;ton &#383;ince our la&#383;t,
Five Whites.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three Blacks.
 Baptiz'd in the &#383;everal Churches, Four.



This custom was continued many years. We take the following from the
"Massachusetts Centinel," April 2, 1788:&mdash;

BURIED in town la&#383;t week 11&mdash;BAPTISED 14.

Publi&#383;hed by BENJAMIN RUSSELL, near the
State-Hou&#383;e, Bo&#383;ton.



General Wolfe's Manifesto from the "Boston Gazette," Dec. 10, 1759.

As the Manife&#383;to lately publi&#383;hed was only a
Tran&#383;lation from a French Manu&#383;cript, we are reque&#383;ted
to publi&#383;h the following, which is


General WOLFE's Manife&#383;to,
as written by Him&#383;elf.

The formidable Sea and Land Armament which the People of
Canada now behold in the Heart of their Country is
intended by the King my Ma&#383;ter to check the in&#383;olence of
France;&mdash;To revenge the In&#383;ults offered to the[Pg 26]
Briti&#383;h Colonies, and totally deprive the French of
their mo&#383;t valuable Settlements in North-America.

For the&#383;e Purpo&#383;es only is the Formidable Army under my
Command intended.

The King of Great-Britain wages no War with the
Indu&#383;trious Pea&#383;ant, the &#383;acred Orders of Religion, or
the defencele&#383;s Women and Children: To the&#383;e in their
di&#383;tre&#383;sful Circum&#383;tances His Royal Clemency offers
Protection. The People may remain unmole&#383;ted on their
Lands, inhabit their Hou&#383;es, and enjoy their Religion in
Security. For the&#383;e ine&#383;timable Ble&#383;&#383;ings, I expect
the Canadians will take no Part in the Great Conte&#383;t
between the two Crowns; But if by a vain Ob&#383;tinacy, and
mi&#383;guided Valour, they pre&#383;ume to appear in Arms, they
mu&#383;t expect the mo&#383;t fatal Con&#383;equences; their
Habitations de&#383;troyed, their &#383;acred Temples expo&#383;ed to
the Fury of an exa&#383;perated Soldiery; their Harve&#383;t
utterly ruined, and the only Pa&#383;&#383;age of Relief &#383;topped
up by a mo&#383;t formidable Fleet.&mdash;In this unhappy Situation,
and clo&#383;ely attacked by another great Army, what can the
wretched Natives expect from Oppo&#383;ition!

THE unparelelled Barbarities exerted by the French
again&#383;t our Settlements in America, might ju&#383;tify the
bittere&#383;t Revenge in the Army under my Command; but
Britons breathe higher Sentiments of Humanity, and
li&#383;ten to the merciful Dictates of the Chri&#383;tian
Religion. Yet &#383;hould you &#383;uffer your&#383;elves to be
deluded by an imaginary Pro&#383;pect of our want of Succe&#383;s;
&#383;hould you refu&#383;e tho&#383;e Terms, and per&#383;i&#383;t[Pg 27] in
Oppo&#383;ition; Then &#383;urely will the Law of Nations
ju&#383;tify the Wa&#383;te of War, &#383;o nece&#383;&#383;ary to cru&#383;h an
ungenerous Enemy: and Then, the mi&#383;erable Canadians
mu&#383;t in the Winter have the Mortification of &#383;eeing
tho&#383;e very Families, they have been exerting a fruitle&#383;s
and indi&#383;creet Bravery for, peri&#383;h by the mo&#383;t
di&#383;mal Want and Famine.

In this great Dilemma let the Wi&#383;dom of the People of
Canada &#383;hew it&#383;elf!

BRITAIN &#383;tretches out a powerful, yet a merciful Hand,
Faithful to her Engagements, and ready to &#383;ecure them in
their mo&#383;t valuable Rights and Po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ions.

FRANCE, unable to &#383;upport Canada, de&#383;erts her
Cau&#383;e at this important Cri&#383;is, and during the whole War
has a&#383;&#383;i&#383;ted her with Troops, who have been maintained
only by making the Natives feel all the Weight of grievous
and lawle&#383;s Oppre&#383;&#383;ion.

JAMES WOLFE.



Bo&#383;ton, November 2, 1761.

La&#383;t Evening, ju&#383;t at Eight o'Clock, this Town was
alarmed with the Shock of an EARTHQUAKE.

Gazette.

[Pg 28]

On the 15th of August, 1763, the "Boston Post-Boy" gives the following
account of the celebration of a royal birthday:&mdash;

BOSTON, Augu&#383;t 15.

On Friday being the Birth-Day of the Prince of Wales, and
the Anniver&#383;ary of the Acce&#383;&#383;ion of the Hou&#383;e of
Hanover, and al&#383;o of the Surrender of the Havanna,
which was the immediate Means of bringing about the Peace;
at One o'Clock the Guns at the Ca&#383;tle and Town Batteries
were Fired; and in the Evening his Excellency the Governor
gave a Ball at Concert Hall. There were pre&#383;ent about 240
Gentlemen and Ladies; the Ball was opened by General
Shirley and the Governor's Lady about 8 o'Clock; the
Country Dances began about nine, and about ten a Supper Room
was opened, where was a very hand&#383;ome Collation. The
Ladies made a brilliant Appearance, and the Company
expre&#383;&#383;ed the highe&#383;t Plea&#383;ure and Satisfaction on the
Occa&#383;ion, and broke up about two in the Morning. The whole
was conducted with the greate&#383;t Order, Elegance and
Decorum.



The great military "occasion" of those days was the annual parade of the
Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company. In June, 1763,[Pg 29] that Company
celebrated its one hundred and twenty-fifth anniversary. In the "Boston
Post-Boy" of June 13 we have this account:&mdash;

Monday la&#383;t, agreeable to ancient Cu&#383;tom, the Artillery
Company of the Province, appeared under Arms, being the
Anniver&#383;ary of the Election of Officers for the Company: A
Sermon was preached by the Rev'd Mr. Balch of Dedham, at
the Old Brick Meeting-Hou&#383;e, where his Excellency the
Governor, the Members of his Maje&#383;ty's Council and Hou&#383;e
of Repre&#383;entatives, with a Number of other Gentlemen,
attended; after which they proceeded to Faneuil-Hall, where
an elegant Dinner was provided; and in the Afternoon the
following Gentlemen were cho&#383;en for the en&#383;uing Year,
viz.


Thomas Mar&#383;hall, E&#383;q; Captain,
Mr. Jo&#383;iah Waters, Lieutenant,
Mr. Jeremiah Belknap, En&#383;ign.


In the Evening a plentiful Repa&#383;t was given by the
Officers newly elected, at Faneuil-Hall; where many loyal
Healths were drank.



After the great fire in Boston in March, 1760, this item appeared in the
"Gazette" of May 19:[Pg 30]&mdash;

We hear that Charles Ward Apthorp, E&#383;q; of N.-York,
Merchant, upon hearing of the Calamity which had befallen
this Town by the late dreadful Fire, generou&#383;ly ordered
his Agent here to pay to the Gentlemen appointed to receive
the Donations of charitable di&#383;pos'd Per&#383;ons the Sum of
One Hundred Pounds, L.M. for the Relief of the Sufferers.

Mr. Apthorp, of New York, made this generous donation&mdash;a large sum for
that time&mdash;for the relief of the sufferers of his native place.



On the 30th of March, 1761, the "Boston Gazette" prints the following
among its items of news:&mdash;

The following Proverbs we hope will not be di&#383;regarded,
tho' taken from a Book in the Hands of almo&#383;t every
Freeholder in this Province; for they are true Engli&#383;h
Proverbs&mdash;&mdash;

Look before you leap&mdash;Wi&#383;e Men think twice before they
act once&mdash;Avoidance is better than late Repentance&mdash;Put your
Hand in the Lion's Mouth, then get it out if you
can&mdash;Ha&#383;te makes Wa&#383;te&mdash;Fa&#383;t bind fa&#383;t find&mdash;A Wedge

Caution&mdash;Once well done is twice done&mdash;A wi&#383;e Man

Murderers, Self-Murderers are the mo&#383;t &#383;tupid&mdash;A Snake
in the Gra&#383;s may bite before it is &#383;een.

A Word to the Wi&#383;e is &#383;ufficient. Amen.



Boston in Olden Times.&mdash;The "Boston Transcript," in a notice of the
newspapers published in Boston in 1767, of which there were ten, says:
The printer in those days was a man of "all work." If a negro or horse
was up for sale, the printer was the seller. The advertisements in these
old papers are curiosities in their line. The following notices appeared
in the advertising columns of the "Boston Evening Gazette," in 1741:&mdash;

"To be sold by the Printer of this Paper, the very best
negro woman in this town, who has had the small pox and the
measles; is as hearty as a horse, as brisk as a bird, and
will work like a beaver."

"To be sold by the Printer of this Paper, a negro man about
thirty years old, who can do both town and country business
very well, but will suit the country best, where they have
not so many dram-shops[Pg 32] as we have in Boston. He has worked
at the printing business fifteen or sixteen years; can
handle axe, saw, spade, hoe, or other instrument of
husbandry, as well as most men, and values himself, and is
valued by others, for his skill in cookery."



This item, from a paper of 1767, seems to show that the Government was
not then obliged to have a "bill" to uphold silver, for it was evidently
in the ascendency; but there was no Western territory at that time, or
rather, it had not been discovered.

Gold as well as Silver will be taken for the Tickets, and
the Prizes paid off in like Manner. Prizes not demanded
within Twelve Months after Drawing, will not be paid, but
will be deem'd as generou&#383;ly given for the Purpo&#383;e
afore&#383;aid, and applied accordingly.

Tickets to be had of the re&#383;pective Managers, and of Edes
and Gill.



Fashionable weddings in the days of the spinning-wheel were not so fully
described as they are at the present day. Nothing used[Pg 33] to be said about
the "magnificent dresses," "best man," "ushers," "contracting parties,"
"elegant presents," etc., etc.; there was a simple announcement of the
fact. Here are specimens of marriage announcements,&mdash;persons belonging
to the first families in Boston.

"Boston Gazette," Feb. 5, 1759.

La&#383;t Thur&#383;day Morning, was married at King's-Chappel,
Dr. Thomas Bulfinch, Son of the late Dr. Bulfinch of this
Town, to Mrs. Susan Apthorpe, Daughter of the late Charles
Apthorpe, E&#383;q; The Rev'd Mr. Apthorpe perform'd the
Ceremony, before a very great Number of Spectators.

Green &amp; Ru&#383;&#383;ell Printers in Queen-&#383;treet.



The "Virginia Gazette" gives an account of an early and bold attempt at
British impressment of seamen. This business caused us a great deal of
trouble in after years, and was one of the causes of "Madison's War," as
the old people were fond of calling it.

The press-gang was one of the peculiar institutions of Great Britain.

BOSTON, October 26, 1767.

By the Virginia Gazette, of the fir&#383;t In&#383;tant, it
appears that Captain Morgan, of the Hornet Sloop of War,
concerted a bloody riotous Plan, to impre&#383;s Seamen, at
Norfolk, for which Purpo&#383;e, his Tender was equipped with
Guns and Men, and under Cover of the Night &#383;aid Morgan
landed at a public Wharff, having fir&#383;t made proper
Di&#383;po&#383;itions either for an Attack or Retreat, then went
to a Tavern, and took[Pg 35] a chearful Gla&#383;s, after which they
went to work, and took every Per&#383;on they met with, and
knocked all down that re&#383;i&#383;ted; and dragged them on
board the Tender; but the Town &#383;oon took the Alarm, and
being headed by Paul Loyal, E&#383;q; a Magi&#383;trate, they
endeavoured to convince Capt. Morgan of his Error, and being
deaf to all they &#383;aid he ordered the People in the Tender
to fire on the Inhabitants, but they refu&#383;ed to obey their
Commanders Orders, and he was &#383;oon obliged to fly, leaving
&#383;ome of the Hornets behind, who were &#383;ent to Gaol, but
were afterwards relea&#383;ed.

Mr. John Ashton, in his recently published work on "Social Life in
England at the end of the Eighteenth Century," informs us that one
evening in the year 1790, 2,100 men were pressed in London alone,
besides many more at the seaport towns.



In the summer of 1762 there was a severe drought in Massachusetts, and
the Governor issued a proclamation recommending public prayers for rain;
but it will be noticed that he says if rain should come before the day
set apart for prayers, then, instead of humiliation, it would be the
duty of the people to make it a day of thanksgiving. The proclamation[Pg 36]
referred to was published in the "Boston Post-Boy" of July 13, 1762.






By His Excellency

FRANCIS BERNARD, E&#383;q;

Captain-General and Governor in Chief, in and over His
Maje&#383;ty's Province of Ma&#383;&#383;achu&#383;etts-Bay in
New-England, and Vice-Admiral of the &#383;ame.

A PROCLAMATION

For a Day of Public Prayer.

It having plea&#383;ed Almighty God to vi&#383;it this Province
with another &#383;evere Drought, which, if it &#383;hould
continue much longer, cannot fail of bringing great
Di&#383;tre&#383;s upon the Inhabitants thereof&mdash;We are again
called upon to &#383;upplicate the Interpo&#383;ition of Divine
Providence to relieve this Country from the imminent Danger
with which it is threatned, by di&#383;pen&#383;ing timely and
plentiful Rain.

I have therefore thought fit to appoint, and I do, by and
with the Advice of His Maje&#383;ty's Council, appoint
Wedne&#383;day the Twenty-eighth Day of this[Pg 37] In&#383;tant July
to be a Day of Public Prayer throughout the Province:
Whereon the whole People may as at one Time humble
them&#383;elves before Almighty God, acknowledging their great
Unworthine&#383;s, and confe&#383;&#383;ing their manifold Sins, and
imploring the Supreme Di&#383;pen&#383;er of all Good, that He
would be graciou&#383;ly plea&#383;ed not to with-hold from them
the Fruits of the Earth, but by &#383;ea&#383;onable and
refre&#383;hing Rains bring what yet remains unde&#383;troyed to a
due and &#383;ea&#383;onable Maturity.

And whereas &#383;ome Places have been exempted from the
general Want of Rain; and it is to be hoped that before the
Day appointed as afore&#383;aid, many others, and po&#383;&#383;ibly
the whole Province, may have a gracious and timely Relief:
It will be our Duty to intermix Thank&#383;giving with
Humiliation, in &#383;uch a Manner as the State of the
Province, and particular Parts thereof, &#383;hall at that Time
require.

And I do order the &#383;aid Day to be ob&#383;erved as a Day
&#383;et apart for Religious Wor&#383;hip, and that no &#383;ervile
Labour or Recreation be permitted thereon.

GIVEN at the Council-Chamber in Bo&#383;ton, the Ninth Day
of July, 1762, in the Second Year of the Reign of our
Sovereign Lord GEORGE the Third, by the Grace of GOD, of
Great-Britain, France, and Ireland, KING, Defender of the
Faith, &amp;c.

Fire-works to be "play'd off," Aug. 13, 1759. From the "Boston Gazette."

The Publick REJOICINGS in Town this Day, on Account of the
Succe&#383;s of His Maje&#383;ty's Arms in the Reduction of
Ticonderoga, Niagara and Crown-Point, by the Troops under
the Command of the victorious General AMHERST, are now
beginning&mdash;A great Number of People have been employ'd in
making Fire-Works, &amp;c. which will be play'd off this
Evening, when there will be a hand&#383;ome illumination.



The "Post-Boy" of November 15 of that year prints the following:&mdash;

NEW-YORK, November 15.

The Ships Manche&#383;ter and Edward, that arrived here lately
from London, brought over no le&#383;s than 206 Che&#383;ts of
Green and Bohea Teas, for the different Merchants of this
City.

Since our la&#383;t two Ve&#383;&#383;els arrived here from Ireland,
with about 2000 Firkins of choice Iri&#383;h Butter, which we
hope will bring down the Price of that Article.



We get an idea of men's clothing in 1767 from the following:[Pg 39]&mdash;

Whereas in the Time of Divine Service Ye&#383;terday, the
Hou&#383;e of the Sub&#383;criber was broke open, and the
following Things &#383;tolen from thence, viz. a
Chocolate-colour Coat and Jacket trim'd with Bra&#383;s
Buttons, a cloth-colour'd cut-velvet Jacket with white
Buttons, a pair Wa&#383;h-Leather Breeches with white Buttons,
five Silver Tea-Spoons, and one large ditto, mark'd G.P.

Lectures were not common in the last century. It was not until within
fifty or sixty years ago, when Lyceums began to be established, that the
lecture system became developed.

We find that in 1769 a Mr. Douglass lectured in Boston, according to an
advertisement in the "Chronicle," August 17th.

The well-known Colonel David Mason of the Revolution, who was a
prominent figure among the patriots at Leslie's Retreat at the[Pg 40] North
Bridge in Salem in February, 1775, was one of the earliest, if not the
very first, to lecture in Salem upon a scientific subject. In the "Essex
Gazette," Jan. 15, 1771, we find his advertisement:&mdash;

No longer than next Week, will
Continue to be exhibited,
every Evening in which the Air is dry, (Saturday and Sunday
excepted)

A Course of Experiments in that in&#383;tructive and
entertaining Branch of Natural PHILOSOPHY, called

Electricity,

To be accompanied with Methodical Lectures on the Nature and
Properties of that WONDERFUL ELEMENT,

By David Ma&#383;on,


At his Dwelling-Hou&#383;e near the North Bridge.
The Cour&#383;e to con&#383;i&#383;t of two Lectures,
At a Pi&#383;tareen each Lecture.

As the Knowledge of Nature tends to enlarge the human Mind,
and give us more noble, more grand and exalted Ideas of the
Author of Nature, and if well pur&#383;ued, &#383;eldom fails
producing &#383;omething u&#383;eful[Pg 41] to Man, 'tis hoped the&#383;e
Lectures may be thought worthy of Regard and Encouragement.

Thus we see that Salem was early in the field of literature and science.
Its citizens must take pride in remembering such great names as
Nathaniel Bowditch, William H. Prescott, Joseph Story, Timothy
Pickering, John Pickering, Benjamin Peirce, William W. Story, Nathaniel
Hawthorne, and many others.



When we see the great waste of paper in these days,&mdash;handbills,
circulars, and newspapers, which are blowing about the streets at
times,&mdash;we sometimes wonder how it was in 1767, on October 19, when the
following notice appeared in the "Boston Gazette."

&#9758; This is to give Notice, That on TUESDAY the 27th
In&#383;tant, the Bell-Cart will go thro' Bo&#383;ton, to
collect Linnen Rags for Milton Paper-Mill; as the
highe&#383;t Price will be given, all Hou&#383;e-keepers and
others are de&#383;ired to have them in Readine&#383;s.&mdash;And, as
it appears that all Sorts of Paper now to be imported, will
come at a much higher Price than u&#383;ual&mdash;if People will but
&#383;ave their Rags, it will not only be greatly intere&#383;ting
to the Public that the afore&#383;aid Mill &#383;hould have a full
Supply, but will al&#383;o[Pg 43] encourage the manufacturing of all
&#383;uch different Sorts of Paper as are generally u&#383;ed
among us, and a little to &#383;pare the neighbouring
Governments.



Here are two notices,&mdash;the first, nearly eight years before the battle
of Lexington, sounds warlike; the second is a call to promote greater
economy on the part of the inhabitants.

Me&#383;&#383;ieurs Edes &amp; Gill,

Plea&#383;e to in&#383;ert the following in your next.

It is rumoured, and &#383;ome &#383;ay with great Probability,
that a Body of Troops are ordered to be in Readine&#383;s at
Halifax, to embark to any Part on the Continent of America,
upon the fir&#383;t Notice of Unea&#383;ine&#383;s at the Novelties
we daily expect.&mdash;It is as certain that America is al&#383;o in
Readine&#383;s to defend their Liberties at the Ri&#383;que of
every Thing el&#383;e&mdash;there can be no He&#383;itation whenever
the Alternative &#383;hall be Slavery or Death&mdash;If therefore
they wait to know whether we will tamely &#383;ubmit to
Slavery, the &#383;ooner the Matter is bro't to a Cri&#383;is the
better.&mdash;&mdash;But while we have any Opinion of the Integrity
and good Sen&#383;e of the Parliament of G.B. &#383;uch Reports
will not ea&#383;ily gain Credit. Determinatus.

[Pg 44]

The Freeholders and other Inhabitants of this Town, are to
meet at Faneuil-Hall, on Wedne&#383;day next, to con&#383;ider and
agree upon &#383;ome effectual Mea&#383;ures to promote
Indu&#383;try, Oeconomy, and Manufactures, thereby to prevent
the unnece&#383;&#383;ary Importation of European Commodities, which
threaten the Country with Poverty and Ruin, &amp;c.&mdash;&mdash;



Timothy Pickering, the father of the distinguished Revolutionary officer
and statesman of the same name, addressed an open letter to King George
III., which is printed in the "Salem Gazette," Oct. 31, 1769. It is a
very quaint production, but it shows the writer's love of simplicity and
downright honesty. He was a sturdy Puritan.

"Oct. 31, 1769.

"To the King of Great Britain.

"Great Sir,&mdash;Your Kingdom is like a Hou&#383;e divided
again&#383;t it&#383;elf. Something Extraordinary mu&#383;t be done.
Our Parliaments for fifty years pa&#383;t (or &#383;ome of them)
have ruined the Nation, in making a mon&#383;trous Debt by
hiring Money, while greater Sums have been expended in Pride
and Luxury. Thirteen hundred Thou&#383;and Pounds Sterling, the
Public Prints tell us, is paid annually to the Dutch as
Intere&#383;t money. My Advice is that all Rulers and
Officers,[Pg 45] who have high Salaries, drop them, except &#383;o
much as is nece&#383;&#383;ary for plain Living;&mdash;(Samuel had more
Honour in his plain Living with his upright Mind, than Saul
had in all his Princely Grandeur,)&mdash;And that all
unnece&#383;&#383;ary Pen&#383;ions cea&#383;e together with military
Officers half-pay, (How Unequal are our Ways: The&#383;e
Officers mu&#383;t have large Half-Pay, while the common
Soldiers are not allowed &#383;mall Half-Pay&mdash;who have been
expo&#383;ed generally to greater Hardships than their
Officers. Either let all have Half-Pay or none. The Soldiers
are to be re&#383;pected as well as their Officers and are as
nece&#383;&#383;ary,) and that high Taxes very high be laid on all
Pride and Luxury, wherever it is found, the Clergy and the
Women not excepted; And that great Taxes be laid on the
Rich. I have an Income of but about eighty Pounds Sterling a
Year, including my own Hands Labour, neverthele&#383;s I am
freely willing to pay one quarter Part of it in Taxes till
my Public Debts are paid. Others that have Two hundred a
Year, can with Ea&#383;e pay one half of it in Taxes, if need
be. Pay thy Debts; Owe no man anything is Law, Divine and
Moral. Immoral Men are in the road that leads to Hell; if
they attend Public Wor&#383;hip, they are Hypocrites, like the
Scribes and Phari&#383;ees, of whom Chri&#383;t &#383;aid, Ye are
of your Father the Devil. If I under&#383;tand the Apo&#383;tle,
when such Men &#383;it or kneel at a Communion Table, it is a
Table of Devils to them. Pray, Sir, tell your Placemen that
the va&#383;t Multitude of your Subjects are very unea&#383;y that
&#383;o[Pg 46] much of the Public Money, when rai&#383;ed is &#383;unk in
the Gulph of Exhorbitancy. My Governor, Mr. Francis Bernard,
demands a thou&#383;and Pounds Sterling a Year; one half that
Sum is more than Enough, e&#383;pecially as the Nation is ready
to &#383;ink with the Weight of its Public Debt. The Clergy
can tell their Congregations that the New Te&#383;tament rather
reproves than commands the wearing of co&#383;tly Array and
faring &#383;umptuou&#383;ly every Day; And I may venture to tell
my Readers that all tho&#383;e who neglect taking a
con&#383;cientious care to pay their Debts, private Debts, as
well as public, are in the high Way to De&#383;truction; the
commonne&#383;s of the Sin don't abate the Malignity of it.

P.S. Your Maje&#383;ty &#383;ees how diligent Governor Nehemiah
was in reforming what was ami&#383;s in I&#383;rael. He was
obliged indeed to contend with the Nobles and the Rulers who
oppo&#383;ed him, but he &#383;ubdued them, and no wonder!
Becau&#383;e he feared God and not Man.

From a loyal Subject of my King and a &#383;incere Friend to
his Kingdom.


TIMOTHY PICKERING.

Mr. Pickering wrote a letter to his son, while the latter was a student
at Harvard College, requesting him not to play at cards, a practice
which he regarded as wicked. But the son (Colonel Timothy Pickering
afterwards), as Mr. Upham, his biographer, well remarks, was[Pg 47] altogether
too busy with his studies to waste time over cards.



We do not observe in the old papers much that would indicate a belief in
modern Spiritualism; but it would seem from some accounts that "angels"
were occasionally seen. In the cases we quote, the kind of "angels" is
not stated. Whether they were real live beauties, or not, can only be
conjectured. Who would not now like to buy one of these books at "four
Coppers," so as to read all about these angels?

In the "Boston Post-Boy" for Dec. 12, 1763, is an account of the
dedication of the Synagogue in Newport, [Pg 49]R.I.

NEWPORT, December 5.

On Friday la&#383;t, in the Afternoon, was the Dedication of
the new Synagogue, in this Town. It began by a hand&#383;ome
Proce&#383;&#383;ion, in which were carried the Books of the Law, to
be depo&#383;ited in the Ark. Several Portions of Scripture,
and of their Service, with a Prayer for the Royal Family,
were read, and finely &#383;ung by the Prie&#383;t and People.
There were pre&#383;ent many Gentlemen and Ladies. The Order
and Decorum, the Harmony and Solemnity of the Mu&#383;ick,
together with a hand&#383;ome A&#383;&#383;embly of People, in an
Edifice the mo&#383;t perfect of the Temple Kind perhaps in
America, and &#383;plendidly illuminated, could not but rai&#383;e
in the Mind a faint Idea of the Maje&#383;ty and Grandeur of
the antient Jewi&#383;h Wor&#383;hip mentioned in Scripture.



We find by the "Salem Mercury" of March 30, 1789, that New Hackensack
was fifty or sixty years before Rochester in "rappings" and
"table-tippings." Who shall say that these manifestations, whatever they
are, are not as old as man himself? The best and wisest of us do not
know everything. There may be some science, yet in its infancy, which
will some day be explained, so that all these things will then be
perfectly understood. The[Pg 50] account here given has no appearance of
deception. Had the girl lived a hundred years earlier, she would in all
probability have been hanged for a witch; but had she lived in these
days, she might have reaped a harvest from lectures and s&eacute;ances.

PHILADELPHIA, March 10.

Extract of a letter from a gentleman at Fi&#383;hkill, dated
March 3, 1789.

"Were I to relate the many extraordinary accounts of the
unfortunate girl at New-Hacken&#383;ack, your belief might,
perhaps, be &#383;taggered. I &#383;hall therefore only inform you
of what I was an eyewitne&#383;s to. La&#383;t Sunday afternoon
my&#383;elf and wife went to Dr. Thorn's, and after &#383;itting
&#383;ometime, we heard a knocking under the feet of a young
woman that lives in the family; I a&#383;ked the Doctor what
occa&#383;ioned the noi&#383;e&mdash;he could not tell, but replied,
that he, together with &#383;everal others had examined the
hou&#383;e, but were unable to di&#383;cover the cau&#383;e. I then
took a candle, and went with the girl into the cellar&mdash;there
the knocking al&#383;o continued; but as we were a&#383;cending
the &#383;tairs to return, I heard a prodigious rapping on each
&#383;ide, which alarmed me very much. I &#383;tood &#383;till &#383;ome
time looking around with amazement, when I beheld &#383;ome
lumber, which lay at the head of the &#383;tairs, &#383;hake
con&#383;iderably. About eight or ten days[Pg 51] after, we vi&#383;ited
the girl again&mdash;the knocking &#383;till continued, though much
louder. Our curio&#383;ity induced us to pay the third vi&#383;it,
when the phenomena were &#383;till more alarming. I then &#383;aw
the chairs move; a large dining table was thrown again&#383;t
me, and a &#383;mall &#383;tand on which &#383;tood a candle, was
to&#383;&#383;ed up, and thrown in my wife's lap; after which we
left the hou&#383;e, much &#383;urpri&#383;ed at what we had &#383;een."



Advertisements for runaway slaves are very numerous, as well as offers
for the sale of single slaves. In some instances negro children are "to
be given away." The following notices are taken from the "Boston
Gazette" and the "Boston Post-Boy." The descriptions of dress, personal
appearance, etc., are very curious.

Ran away from Thomas Poynton of Salem, a Negro Fellow,
about 25 Years of Age, a &#383;hort thick-&#383;et Fellow, not
very black, &#383;omething pitted with the Small-Pox, &#383;peaks

Boston, for aught we know, did as much in the slave-trade as Newport;
possibly more. The numerous advertisements of "Prime Men and Boys" and
"Parcels of likely Negroes" which appear about this time in the Boston
papers rather indicate a considerable trade in slaves.

JUST Imported,

From AFRICA.

A Number of prime young SLAVES, from the Windward Coa&#383;t,
and to be Sold on board Capt. Gwin lying at New-Bo&#383;ton.

Boston Gazette, July 13, 1761.



To be &#383;old, a parcel of likely hearty Negroes, both Male
and Female from Ten Years of Age to Twenty, imported the
la&#383;t Week from AFRICA. Enquire of Capt. Wickham on
board the Sloop Diamond, now laying at the Wharff
adjoining to John Avery's Di&#383;till-Hou&#383;e near the South
Market, or of &#383;aid Avery at his Hou&#383;e next the White
Hor&#383;e.

We have not been able to find that any of the inhabitants of Salem
engaged in the slave-trade; but we notice that at a town-meeting held in
the month of May, 1773, the following vote was passed: "That the
Representatives of the Town be instructed to use their utmost Endeavours
to prevent the future Importation[Pg 57] of Negroes into this Province; their
Slavery being repugnant to the natural Rights of Mankind and highly
prejudicial to the Province." It is of course possible that some Salem
people may have been interested in vessels hailing from other places and
engaged in this nefarious traffic, as it is now considered.

The celebrated revival preacher Rev. George Whitefield was in Boston in
1764. We take the following item from the "Boston Post-Boy" of February
24:[Pg 58]&mdash;

At a Meeting of the Freeholders and other Inhabitants of the
Town of Bo&#383;ton on Friday la&#383;t, it was voted
unanimou&#383;ly, That the Thanks of the Town be given the Rev.
Mr. George Whitefield, for his charitable Care and Pains in
collecting a con&#383;iderable Sum of Money in Great-Britain,
for the di&#383;tre&#383;&#383;ed Sufferers by the great Fire in
Bo&#383;ton, 1760; and a re&#383;pectable Committee was appointed
to wait on Mr. Whitefield to inform him of the Vote, and
pre&#383;ent him with a Copy thereof, which Committee waited
upon him accordingly, and received the following An&#383;wer,

Gentlemen,

This Vote of Thanks for &#383;o &#383;mall an In&#383;tance of my
good-will to Bo&#383;ton, as it was entirely unexpected,
quite &#383;urprizes me&mdash;&mdash;Often have I been much concerned
that I could do no more upon &#383;uch a di&#383;tre&#383;&#383;ing
Occa&#383;ion.&mdash;&mdash;That the Redeemer may ever pre&#383;erve the
Town from &#383;uch like melancholy Events, and &#383;anctify
their pre&#383;ent afflictive Circum&#383;tances to the
&#383;piritual Welfare of all its Inhabitants, is the hearty
Prayer of,

Gentlemen,
Your ready Servant in our common LORD.
GEORGE WHITEFIELD.

The Rev. Mr. WHITEFIELD preached on Tue&#383;day and Saturday
la&#383;t, at the Old South Meeting-Hou&#383;e, to large and
crouded Auditories.

Marriage of Copley, the celebrated painter, from the "Chronicle," Nov.
20, 1769.

La&#383;t Thur&#383;day Mr. John Singleton Copley was married to
Mi&#383;s Sukey Clarke Daughter of Richard Clarke, E&#383;q;
and Mr. Jo&#383;hua Hen&#383;haw, jun. to Mi&#383;s Katherine

Where were or where was, as the case might be, the "Cornfields" or
"Cornfield" of Boston in 1763? Martin Gay kept a store or lived near
there, and in 1767 Master Britt kept a school for young ladies near the
"Cornfield."

When we remember the old pictures and portraits of stately ladies with
high headdresses and gentlemen with wigs, the following advertisements
are interesting:&mdash;

Jo&#383;hua Davis, Peruke-Maker.

Hereby informs his Cu&#383;tomers, and others, That he has

At fires, leather buckets were used by the inhabitants, and were
sometimes lost or misplaced, as appears from the following
advertisements from the "Boston Gazette":&mdash;

Lost at the late Fire on the 5th of November In&#383;t. a
Leather Bucket, No. 2, mark'd Wm. Hickling: Whoever is
taken up the &#383;ame, are de&#383;ir'd to return it to the
Owner, or the Printers hereof.



LOST at the Fire near Oliver's-Dock, on the 14th Day of
November la&#383;t, a Pair of Leather Fire Buckets, mark'd
Benja. Barnard, and dated 1757.[Pg 62] Whoever will give
Information, or bring them to the Printers hereof, &#383;hall
be hand&#383;omely Rewarded.

Dec. 10, 1759.

Within the writer's recollection, in nearly every house in Salem two or
more fire-buckets, marked with the owner's name, were, when not in use,
kept hanging in the front hall. At fires, lanes, as they were called, of
men were formed, under the direction generally of the fire-wards, and
water was passed from one to another and to the fire from some
neighboring pump or cistern.



We see notices like the following of insurance offices; but they were
principally for marine risks, as not many fire risks were taken before
the beginning of the present century.

Hurd's In&#383;urance-Office,

At the Bunch of Grapes, State-Street, BOSTON,

Open at all hours of bu&#383;ine&#383;s, where Policies of
In&#383;urance are underwritten upon the mo&#383;t moderate

THIS is to inform all Gentlemen in Trade,
That

THE INSURANCE OFFICE

Lately kept in Ann-Street near the Town-Dock, by Samuel
Phillips Savage, is removed to the Hou&#383;e of the Honorable
William Brattle, E&#383;q; next Door to the Briti&#383;h
Coffee-Hou&#383;e, King-Street: Where the Bu&#383;ine&#383;s of
In&#383;urance is carried on as u&#383;ual.

Bo&#383;ton, December 6, 1759.

With regard to policies, the term "under-writer" came from an old
custom. There were in old times no joint-stock companies for insurance,
but policies were filled out and left at an office kept by some person
for the purpose, where any responsible man could sign his name to a
particular policy and affix such sum as he was willing to risk, and thus
become one of the "underwriters." We[Pg 64] have seen, for instance, a policy
for $20,000 with twelve or fifteen names of merchants, signed with
various sums from $500 upwards.



A quaint notice of the death of Obadiah Brown, of Providence, from the
"Boston Post-Boy":&mdash;

PROVIDENCE, June 21, 1762.

On Thur&#383;day la&#383;t died at his Seat in the Country, after
two Days Illne&#383;s, Obadiah Brown, E&#383;q; in the 50th Year
of his Age. He was one of the mo&#383;t con&#383;iderable Men in
this Town: In the various Branches of Bu&#383;ine&#383;s which he
carried on, his Activity was unequalled, his Judgment and
Prudence oftener admired than imitated, his Hone&#383;ty and
Integrity fit to be drawn into Example.&mdash;As a Magi&#383;trate,
he was judicious, grave, and re&#383;erved:&mdash;As a Friend,
con&#383;tant, open, facetious, and cheerful:&mdash;In the Relations
of a Hu&#383;band, Father, and Ma&#383;ter, the deep and real
Sorrow of his Widow, the mournful Tears of his Children, and
the unu&#383;ual Cries and Lamentations of his Servants, are
invincible Proofs in his Favour. His Beneficence is
witne&#383;&#383;ed by the Sighs of the Poor and Thanks of the
Trade&#383;men: And his Death is univer&#383;ally lamented,
becau&#383;e his Life was univer&#383;ally u&#383;eful.

[Pg 65]

Notice of Hon. Daniel Russell, from the "Boston Gazette":&mdash;

Charle&#383;town, December 10, 1763.

On Tue&#383;day la&#383;t departed this Life, after a &#383;hort
Illne&#383;s, the Hon. Daniel Russell, E&#383;q; who, for upwards
of Twenty Years, was a Member of his Maje&#383;ty's Council for
this Province: He al&#383;o &#383;erved the Province as
Commi&#383;&#383;ioner of Impo&#383;t, and the County of Middle&#383;ex as
Trea&#383;urer, for more than fifty Years; in the Di&#383;charge
of all which Offices, &#383;uch was his con&#383;cientious
Fidelity and un&#383;ullied Integrity, as procured him
univer&#383;al Approbation and E&#383;teem.

In public and private Life, his whole Conduct was &#383;uch as
evidently &#383;howed his invariable de&#383;ire and endeavour to
pre&#383;erve a Con&#383;cience void of Offence both towards God
and Man; and by the Rectitude of his Behaviour, to adorn and
recommend the holy Religion which he profe&#383;&#383;ed, and to
approve him&#383;elf to the all-&#383;earching Eye of the Father
of Spirits.

His Memory is greatly honoured by all who were acquainted
with him, in who&#383;e e&#383;teem he was truly that "noble&#383;t
Work of God, An hone&#383;t Man."

It is ob&#383;ervable that in the &#383;everal Offices which he
&#383;u&#383;tained, he &#383;ucceeded his worthy Father and
Grandfather; both of whom held and di&#383;charged the &#383;ame,
for a great Number of Years, with un&#383;potted Reputation.[Pg 66]

His Remains, we hear, will be inter'd on Monday next, on
which Day, had he lived, he would have entered the 79th Year
of his Age.

Account of the burial of Major-General Whitmore, from the "Boston
Gazette":&mdash;

BOSTON, December 21, 1761.

Wedne&#383;day afternoon the Corps of Major General Whitmore
was interred in the King's Chapple with all the Honours that
this Town could give. The Proce&#383;&#383;ion went from the

Mini&#383;ters, and principal Gentlemen of the Town, a great
Number of Coaches and Chariots following. During the whole
Proce&#383;&#383;ion Minute-Guns were fired. The Corps was placed in
the Middle of the King's Chapple whil&#383;t Part of the
Funeral Service was performed, and was from thence carried
into the Vaults below, and there interred. Whil&#383;t the
la&#383;t Service was performing the Cadets fired three
Vollies.

Notice of Hon. John Erving, from the "Massachusetts Gazette," Aug. 22,
1786:&mdash;

Died, la&#383;t Sunday morning, in the 94th year of his age,
the Hon. John Erving, E&#383;q. who, for twenty years, was a
member of the Council under the old con&#383;titution, and one
of the mo&#383;t eminent merchants in America.

As a man of probity, and &#383;trict hone&#383;ty, he was
univer&#383;ally e&#383;teemed. Tho&#383;e who were acquainted with
his character mu&#383;t regret the lo&#383;s of &#383;o worthy a
member of the community. In his dome&#383;tick life he was a
tender parent and kind ma&#383;ter.&mdash;&mdash;His funeral will be this
afternoon, preci&#383;ely at five o'clock, from his hou&#383;e in
Tremont-&#383;treet, where his friends and acquaintance are
de&#383;ired to attend.



Notice of the death of Mrs. Elizabeth Salisbury, from the "Massachusetts
Centinel," March 28, 1789:&mdash;

La&#383;t Wedne&#383;day night departed this life, very
&#383;uddenly, Mrs. Elizabeth Salisbury, the amiable and
virtuous Con&#383;ort of Mr. Samuel Sali&#383;bury of this town,
merchant. Her funeral will be from his hou&#383;e in
Marlborough-&#383;treet, this afternoon&mdash;which her friends are
de&#383;ired to attend.

[Pg 68]

From the "Boston Chronicle," March 8, 1770:&mdash;

BOSTON.

For &#383;ome days bye-pa&#383;t, there have been &#383;everal
affrays between the inhabitants and the &#383;oldiers quartered
in this town.

La&#383;t Monday about 9 o'clock at night a mo&#383;t unfortunate
affair happened in King-&#383;treet: The centinel po&#383;ted at
the Cu&#383;tom-hou&#383;e, being &#383;urrounded by a number of
people, called to the main-guard, upon which Capt.
Pre&#383;ton, who was Captain of the day, with a party, went to
his a&#383;&#383;i&#383;tance: &#383;oon after which &#383;ome of the party
fired, by which the following per&#383;ons were killed and
wounded,

Mr. Samuel Gray, ropemaker, killed.&mdash;A Mollatto man, named
John&#383;on, killed.&mdash;Mr. James Caldwell, mate of Capt.
Morton's ve&#383;&#383;el, killed.&mdash;Mr. Samuel Maverick, wounded,
and &#383;ince dead.&mdash;A Lad named Chri&#383;topher Monk,
wounded.&mdash;A lad named John Clark, wounded.&mdash;Mr. Edward
Payne, Merchant, &#383;tanding at his entry-door, wounded in
the arm.&mdash;Mr. John Greene, taylor, wounded.&mdash;Mr. Patrick
Cole, wounded.&mdash;David Parker, wounded.

Early next morning Captain Pre&#383;ton was committed to gaol,
and &#383;ame day 8 &#383;oldiers.

A meeting of the inhabitants was called at Fanueil-hall that
forenoon: and the Lieutenant-Governor and Council met at the
Council-chamber, where the Colonels Dalrymple and Carr were
de&#383;ired to attend,[Pg 69] when it was concluded upon, that both
regiments &#383;hould go down to the barracks at
Ca&#383;tle-William, as &#383;oon as they were ready to receive
them.

We decline at pre&#383;ent, giving a more particular account
of this unhappy affair, as we hear the trial of the
unfortunate pri&#383;oners is to come on next week.

This is all the "Boston Chronicle" has to say about that great
historical event of the fifth of March, an event which stirred the whole
country and filled the minds of the Colonists with a perfect hatred of
the British power in America,&mdash;"The Boston Massacre." The editor of the
paper was probably a Tory.



The "Massachusetts Gazette," Feb. 3, 1774, says:&mdash;

We hear that the Hon. JOHN HANCOCK, E&#383;q; is appointed to
deliver the ORATION in Commemoration of the Bloody Tragedy
on the 5th of March.



The "Salem Gazette" has this item, March 7, 1782:[Pg 70]&mdash;

La&#383;t Tue&#383;day Mr. George R. Minot delivered an elegant
and &#383;pirited Oration, at the old brick meeting-hou&#383;e, in
commemoration of the horrid ma&#383;&#383;acre perpetrated on the
5th of March, 1770, by a banditti of the Briti&#383;h tyrant's
29th regiment.



It may not be of any consequence to the public to know what kind of coat
Jonathan Williams wore in 1767, but it may be a matter of curiosity to
his descendants now living. We take the following advertisement from the
"Boston Gazette," Dec. 28, 1767:&mdash;

Whereas there has been taken out of the Hou&#383;e of Jonathan
Williams in Cornhill, two Great Coats, on the 23d
In&#383;tant, one of his own Wearing a cloth-coloured Drab; the
other his Servants, a blue Cloth ditto. Whoever has taken
them, and will return the former to &#383;aid Williams,
&#383;hall have the latter gratis, and no Que&#383;tions
a&#383;k'd.

Essex Gazette, Feb. 21, 1771.



We do not see much in the papers about spinning-wheels until after the
War of the[Pg 73] Revolution; then there seemed to be what may be called a
revival of domestic industry. In 1786 the ladies of Hartford, Conn.,
formed an Economical Association. They say that they are "fully sensible
that our calamities are in a great measure occasioned by the luxury and
extravagance of individuals, and are of opinion that it is a duty they
owe their country as well as their families to retrench as far as
possible all unnecessary expenses." Their articles of agreement were
signed, on the 6th of November, 1786, by more than a hundred ladies
belonging to the first families in the city. By these articles they
engage "not to purchase for next six months any Gauze, Ribbons, Lace,
Feathers, Beaver-Hats, Silks, Muslins, and Chintzes, except only for
weddings and mourning;" also to "dress their persons in the plainest
manner and encourage industry, frugality, and neatness, giving all due
preference to the manufactures of their own country." To this they add
that "when they receive visits and make entertainments, it will be their
study to avoid unnecessary expense, especially on foreign articles." On
June 17 of that year the President of Harvard College addressed a[Pg 74]
letter to the "Massachusetts Gazette" which is interesting in this
connection. This letter we copy to show how economy entered into
everything, even a "liberal education." It will moreover be of interest
because of the attempt made to regulate the students' dress.



University in Cambridge,
June 17, 1786.


To the Publi&#383;her of the Ma&#383;&#383;achu&#383;etts Gazette.

Every proper attempt of the Governours of the Univer&#383;ity
to le&#383;&#383;en the expen&#383;e of a liberal education mu&#383;t be
grateful to the Publick, and meet with their hearty
concurrence; the Members of the Community, therefore, in
general, and the Parents and Guardians of the Students in
particular, it is not doubted, will be well plea&#383;ed with
&#383;ome late regulations, made by the Corporation and
Over&#383;eers, to introduce economy in dre&#383;s, and will
readily perform their part, in carrying them into effect.

By ordering an uniform, the Governours of the Society have
removed the temptation to that frequent change of apparel,
which may have ari&#383;en from the liberty the Students have
had, of chu&#383;ing different colours, from time to time: And
by entirely prohibiting &#383;ilk (an unnece&#383;&#383;ary article in
their clothing) a very con&#383;iderable expen&#383;e is
prevented.

That the dre&#383;s of the Students be neat and decent is
highly proper; but that it &#383;hould be very ornamental[Pg 75] and
expen&#383;ive is ever needle&#383;s, and oftentimes pernicious:
Nor will any Student, who is &#383;olicitous to acquire
knowledge, and &#383;incerely di&#383;po&#383;ed to improve his time
to the be&#383;t advantage, in obtaining &#383;uch degrees of it,
as may enable him to be exten&#383;ively u&#383;eful to the
Community, feel a reluctance to economical in&#383;titutions
re&#383;pecting dre&#383;s. He will not only e&#383;teem the
ornaments of the mind of va&#383;tly higher importance than
tho&#383;e of the body, but the general good will al&#383;o
con&#383;tantly influence his conduct; and he will chearfully
encourage every regulation, which tends to promote
frugality.

The regulations referred to, I now tran&#383;mit to you, which
the Corporation and Over&#383;eers of the Univer&#383;ity
reque&#383;t you to publi&#383;h, for the information of all
concerned.

I am, Sir, your humble &#383;ervant,

JOSEPH WILLARD.



At a Meeting of the Corporation, &amp;c.

June 13, 1786.

Whereas the enjoining of an uniform colour, in the clothing
of the Undergraduates, and prohibiting a certain &#383;pecies
of materials, in their apparel, will have a great tendency
to le&#383;&#383;en the expen&#383;e of dre&#383;s (which, at pre&#383;ent,
con&#383;titutes too large a proportion of the Collegiate
charges) while, at the &#383;ame time, the appearance will be
more academical:

Voted, That it be recommended, that the Fre&#383;hmen, who
&#383;hall be admitted into the Univer&#383;ity the[Pg 76] pre&#383;ent
year, before the end of the Summer Vacation, be provided
with coats of blue-gray, being a mixture of deep blue and
white wool, as nearly as may be, &#383;even eighths of the
blue, and one eighth of the white, or, if that cannot
conveniently be obtained, of a dark blue colour,&mdash;and with
wai&#383;tcoats and breeches of the &#383;ame colour, or of a
&#383;traw colour.

That, when they &#383;hall procure clothes, afterwards, and
while Undergraduates, their coats &#383;hall be of the colour
fir&#383;t mentioned, and their wai&#383;tcoats and breeches of
the &#383;ame colour, or of a &#383;traw colour.

That the Fre&#383;hmen, who &#383;hall be admitted into the
Univer&#383;ity in the year 1787, and afterwards, &#383;hall be
provided with coats of the colour fir&#383;t mentioned, and
with wai&#383;tcoats and breeches as la&#383;t mentioned, and
&#383;hall continue provided with clothes of the&#383;e
&#383;pecified colours while they remain Undergraduates.

That all, who &#383;hall hereafter be admitted, when they
commence Sophimores, &#383;hall have the addition of frogs to
the button holes of their coats, the cuff of the &#383;leeve to
be plain.

That when they commence Junior Sophi&#383;ters, their coats
&#383;hall have the further addition of frogs on the

In 1788 the industry of the people of Providence, R.I., is set forth in
the following notice, from the "Salem Mercury" of November 25:

American Manufactures.

A Providence paper informs, that the Carding and Spinning
Machines u&#383;ed in England in manufacturing cotton &#383;tuffs,
are introducing into that town by &#383;ome publick &#383;pirited
gentlemen&mdash;and that there are few families in that town
which are not manufacturing &#383;ome kind of cloth.



It appears from the "Columbian Centinel," July 14, 1790, that the
wealthy of that day had a fondness for foreign articles.[Pg 79]

Complaint is very prolifick in all countries. In the United States we
complain, that,


Tho' rich at home, to foreign lands we &#383;tray,
And trade for trinkets our be&#383;t wealth away.




The following advertisement from the "Massachusetts Centinel" recalls
the time when cows were pastured on Boston Common.

Strayed, on Saturday la&#383;t, from Bo&#383;ton Common, and
belonging to JONATHAN AMORY, a young red COW, with &#383;ome
white on the back and belly, forehead white, &#383;mall horns,
with the tips off. Whoever will bring her to the owner will
be rewarded.

Bo&#383;ton, May 24, 1788.



People were expected to have long memories in old times, judging from
the following notification in the "Boston Gazette" of 1760:&mdash;

Whereas on the 17th of January 1740-1, twenty-&#383;even yards
and an half of yard-wide &#383;heeting linnen, and &#383;ome
&#383;maller articles, was &#383;old at Mr. James Gordon's
&#383;hop in Bo&#383;ton, and deliver'd to[Pg 80] one capt. Stevens,
as appears by &#383;aid Gordon's book; and thro' &#383;ome
mi&#383;take in keeping his books, &#383;aid articles are charg'd
to another of the &#383;ame name. If therefore the &#383;aid capt.
Stevens, that really had &#383;aid goods, or any of his
family, or others, can give any light into the matter, it is
de&#383;ired they would acquaint the printers hereof, and they
&#383;hall be generou&#383;ly recompenced for their trouble.



The "small pox" was very troublesome in Colonial times, as this
announcement from the "Boston Gazette," Feb. 2, 1761, shows:&mdash;

Samuel Parkman hereby informs his Cu&#383;tomers and others,
That immediately on the breaking out of the Small-Pox in the
back Part of his Hou&#383;e in Union Street, he removed his
Shop Goods to a Store on a Wharf that they may be &#383;afe
from any Infection, and him&#383;elf to the Hou&#383;e of Mr.
Jo&#383;hua Winter Stationer&mdash;The Per&#383;on who had the
Di&#383;temper is perfectly recovered, and departed the Hou&#383;e
&#383;ome Days ago, and the Hou&#383;e thoroughly clean&#383;ed.



The following notice from the "Massachusetts Gazette" reminds us of the
time of open fire-places and blazing, cheerful wood-fires:[Pg 81]

The Selectmen would inform the Town, that they have
approbated a number of Chimney-Sweepers, who are
furni&#383;hed with badges agreeable to the By-Laws, and have
&#383;tipulated to execute their bu&#383;ine&#383;s faithfully, at
the following rates, viz.&mdash;For lower-room chimnies,
fourteen pence two fifths, or one pi&#383;tareen; and for
all chamber chimnies, one &#383;hilling each&mdash;that all
concerned may govern them&#383;elves accordingly.

The Printer is reque&#383;ted to record it among the numerous
in&#383;tances of female benevolence and harmony, which have

lately, at the hou&#383;e of the Rev. Mr. Dana, a numerous band
of ladies, in harmonious concert, have again "laid their
hands to the &#383;pindle, and held the di&#383;taff," and
pre&#383;ented the fruit of their generous toil, 118 run of
good yarn; viz. 88 linen, 30 cotton; the materials,
provi&#383;ions, and hand&#383;ome attendance, all furni&#383;hed by
them&#383;elves and tho&#383;e who joined with them.&mdash;"Give her

From the "Salem Mercury," April 28, 1787.

Not long ago a number of ladies belonging to the
Pre&#383;byterian &#383;ociety in Newbury-Port, a&#383;&#383;embled at the
Par&#383;onage-hou&#383;e, with their &#383;pinning-wheels and other
uten&#383;ils of indu&#383;try, for the day, to the benefit of
their mini&#383;ter's family. The a&#383;&#383;embly having fir&#383;t
united in the &#383;olemn exerci&#383;es of &#383;ocial wor&#383;hip,
the bu&#383;ine&#383;s of the day was opened. Every apartment in
the hou&#383;e was full. The mu&#383;ick of the &#383;pinning-wheel
re&#383;ounded from every room. Benevolence was &#383;een
&#383;miling in every countenance, and the harmony of hearts
&#383;urpa&#383;&#383;ed even the harmony of wheels. The labours of the
day were concluded about 5 o'clock; when the fair labourers
pre&#383;ented Mrs. Murray with cotton and linen yarn, of the
be&#383;t quality, amounting to 236 &#383;keins. Nece&#383;&#383;ary
refre&#383;hment being pa&#383;t, publick wor&#383;hip was attended;
and a di&#383;cour&#383;e delivered, by the Rev. Mr. Murray, to a
large a&#383;&#383;embly, from Exodus 35, 25, And all the women
that were wi&#383;e-hearted did &#383;pin with their hands.



From the "Salem Mercury," Feb. 6, 1787.

There is a young Mi&#383;s in New-Haven, who will &#383;oon wear a
&#383;ilk gown of her own make. Such noble indu&#383;try ought
to be written in letters of gold. May the ladies profit by
the example&mdash;and may it[Pg 83] &#383;oon be e&#383;teemed
di&#383;reputable, by both ladies and gentlemen, to wear any
thick &#383;ilk but of our own manufacture.



An advertisement in the "Boston Gazette," Feb. 19, 1760, rather
indicates that "searchers" sometimes exceeded their powers.

All Per&#383;ons who within five Years pa&#383;t, have had any
Shoes or Boots, &#383;eiz'd and taken from them, in the Town of
Bo&#383;ton, by any of the Searches and Sealers of Leather
there, for being made of Leather unduly tann'd or curried,
or on Pretence thereof; are hereby notified to give or

In 1767 snuff was apparently of more importance, as merchandise, to say
the least, than were Bibles and Testaments. In an advertisement it was
printed in capitals, while the latter were in smaller type.[Pg 84]

Whereas &#383;ome per&#383;on or per&#383;ons have acted &#383;o
villainous a part, as to make u&#383;e of my name in vending
and &#383;elling Snuff of a very bad quality; not only injuring
me in my credit, but cheating the purcha&#383;er, as the Snuff
manufactured by me is of the be&#383;t kind, and which I always
warrant to be &#383;uch.

Some of the purcha&#383;ers of &#383;aid bad Snuff have brought
the &#383;ame to me, &#383;uppo&#383;ing it to be really of my

Massachusetts Centinel.

The habit of Snuff-taking was formerly very prevalent in New England, as
well as elsewhere. Within the writer's recollection it was a very common
thing to see the snuff-box passed round for friends to take a pinch.
Very few now a days indulge in this uncleanly habit; but a recent
traveller relates that on visiting St. Peter's in Rome, the first thing
upon entering the church which attracted his attention was seeing the
Pope take a pinch of snuff and then shake from his pocket a large
old-fashioned bandanna handkerchief, which he applied to his nose. Many
years ago a gentleman of Salem was questioned by a stranger about a
certain man who happened to be an inveterate snuff-taker and who was at
the same time greatly interested in free-masonry. "Yes," said the
gentleman, "I know[Pg 86] him."&mdash;"He's about one third masonry and two thirds
snuff." Mr. Francis H. Lee, of Salem, has a curious collection of a
hundred or more snuff-boxes of former generations. They are of various
patterns; some are made of shell and tipped with silver, and look quite
ancient. Simon Elliot, of Boston, and later Wm. Micklefield, of Salem,
were famous snuff manufacturers.

A CURIOSITY.

E. COPELAND, Jr., has for sale a most elegant Gold SNUFF BOX
set with Pearls, &amp;c. It is about 2&frac12; inches long and from the
top a beautiful little Bird rises at command and sings a
tune. The movements of the wings, beak, eyes, &amp;c. are
perfectly natural, and all its motions while singing are in
complete unison with its notes. This is probably as
ingenious a piece of mechanism as was ever seen in this
town. It will be sold a great bargain.

In this connection we notice "Micklefield's Indian," as it was called, a
well-known landmark[Pg 87] in Salem half a century ago. Mr. Micklefield was
much respected, and noted for his liberality and public spirit.






The Subscriber begs leave to inform his friends and the
public, that owing to the fall in prices of different Scents
and Stock in general, that compose the article of Snuff, he
is thereby enabled to sell his different kinds,
viz.&mdash;Maccoboy, Scented and Plain Rappee and Scotch

SNUFFS,

at a much lower price than heretofore.&mdash;Traders in the
neighboring towns that deal in those articles are
particularly solicited to call at his Store, sign of the[Pg 88]

From the "Salem Mercury," Nov. 25, 1788.

S. Breck, E&#383;q. member of the Hou&#383;e of Repre&#383;entatives
for Bo&#383;ton, appears in his &#383;eat with a complete &#383;uit

About 1787 and 1788, spinning-wheel meetings seem to have been very
popular. We copy notices of meetings of young ladies in Attleboro',
Dighton, Gloucester, Rehoboth, Mass., and Providence and Johnston, R.I.,
all from the "Salem Mercury."[Pg 89]

Attleboro', June 20. Ye&#383;terday, 63 re&#383;pectable young
ladies, belonging to this town, a&#383;&#383;lembled, at 2 o'clock,
P.M. at the hou&#383;e of Mr. Daniel Balkum, and, to the
&#383;urpri&#383;e and great &#383;atisfaction of all the friends to
indu&#383;try, &#383;pun, before &#383;un&#383;et, 199 &#383;keins of
excellent linen yarn. Indu&#383;try is the genuine &#383;ource of
all laudable plea&#383;ure. On it depend all the conveniences
of life. Health, the greate&#383;t of ble&#383;&#383;ings, depends on
indu&#383;try&mdash;beauty, on health. If ladies, then, wi&#383;h to be
beautiful, they mu&#383;t be indu&#383;trious; they mu&#383;t animate
their countenances with that blooming health which comes
from the Spinning-wheel. The fair &#383;ex, when rightly and
indu&#383;triou&#383;ly employed, are ju&#383;tly termed the beauty
of this lower creation. Beauty without virtue is
contemptible. Merit only gains the heart. Idlene&#383;s is
di&#383;graceful. Indu&#383;try is the ornament of wealth, the
&#383;upport and con&#383;olation of poverty. We hope &#383;oon to
&#383;ee the time, when the fair daughters of America will be
clothed in the manufactures of their own hands. Happy are
we, that &#383;ome have already &#383;et the example. May it never
be &#383;aid, that American ladies ri&#383;e 15 minutes later than
the &#383;un. May they ever have thread enough in their hands
to make a halter for a Shays.



On Tue&#383;day la&#383;t, thirteen young ladies a&#383;&#383;embled, with
their &#383;pinning-wheels, at the hou&#383;e of Mr. Jo&#383;eph
Whipple, in North-Providence, and, between the[Pg 90] hours of
eight in the morning and &#383;ix in the afternoon, completed
fifty &#383;keins of excellent linen yarn.

July 1, 1788.



The &#383;pinning-wheel, a few years ago imprudently neglected,
begins to be held in general reputation by the Fair; and the
exploits of &#383;ome on that u&#383;eful machine, are
de&#383;ervedly celebrated, as worthy of imitation. To tho&#383;e
good works of female indu&#383;try may be added the &#383;ingular
attachment of two young ladies in Dighton, who &#383;pun, the
11th in&#383;tant, between the ri&#383;ing and &#383;etting of the
&#383;un, thirteen &#383;keins and eleven lees of good linen yarn;
one &#383;ix &#383;keins and &#383;even, and the other &#383;even
&#383;keins and four lees. The &#383;pirit of indu&#383;try is
becoming more prevalent, e&#383;pecially among the fair &#383;ex.
They begin to lay a&#383;ide their u&#383;ele&#383;s and idle
vi&#383;its, or, at lea&#383;t, make them le&#383;s frequent. When
per&#383;ons become more indu&#383;trious and mind their own
bu&#383;ine&#383;s, they talk le&#383;s, and to better purpo&#383;e;
they become more contented, and the world around them is
more peaceable and happy.

Providence Gazette, July 1, 1788.



Providence, May 24. On the 7th in&#383;t. 71 ladies met at
the hou&#383;e of the Rev. Mr. Ellis, in Rehoboth,[Pg 91] and lodged
187 &#383;keins of good linen yarn, which they had &#383;pun for
Mrs. Ellis; and others have &#383;ince added 31. Solomon, in
de&#383;cribing a virtuous woman, &#383;ays, "She &#383;eeketh wool
and flax, and worketh willingly with her hands.&mdash;She layeth
her hands to the &#383;pindle, and her hands hold the
di&#383;taff." Indu&#383;try is certainly a virtue, which, while
it adorns, enriches, &#383;ociety; it bani&#383;hes the languid
hue from the countenances of the fair, and adds vigour and
vivacity to the mind.&mdash;The &#383;pirited exertions that the
daughters of Columbia are making, to manufacture our wool
and flax, which are nece&#383;&#383;ary for our con&#383;umption, are
prai&#383;e-worthy, and demand the approbation and
a&#383;&#383;i&#383;tance of every true patriot. We flatter our&#383;elves
with the plea&#383;ing expectation of &#383;eeing the virtuous
fair clothed and ornamented in the genuine productions of
their own labour.



We hear from Glouce&#383;ter, that on Thur&#383;day la&#383;t nearly
thirty young ladies, in&#383;pired with the love of indu&#383;try,
a&#383;&#383;lembled at the hou&#383;e of Capt. Philemon Ha&#383;kell, for
the prai&#383;e-worthy purpo&#383;e of a Federal Spinning Match,
when, to their honour, their &#383;pirited exertion produced 99
&#383;keins of excellent yarn&mdash;practically declaring, that they
neither laboured in vain or &#383;pent their &#383;trength for
nought. The day thus indu&#383;triou&#383;ly concluded, fini&#383;hed
not the harmony of their federali&#383;m; in the evening, to
crown the plea&#383;ure of the day, with additional company,
they regaled[Pg 92] with an agreeable dance, and, at a mode&#383;t
hour, parted in love and friend&#383;hip, with hearts convivial
as they met, leaving others to admire their female
patrioti&#383;m, and to go and do likewi&#383;e.

In Scotland, the farmers knit as well as the women of their
families; but they do this while they are watching their
&#383;heep or cattle, or while they are &#383;itting by their
evening fire in winter. Why cannot our American farmers and
their &#383;ons adopt this frugal practice? Time is the mo&#383;t
precious thing in the world. Its very fragments &#383;hould be
&#383;aved.



Providence, May 17. Monday la&#383;t, eighteen young ladies
a&#383;&#383;embled, with their &#383;pinning-wheels, at the hou&#383;e of
Captain Jonathan Treadwell, and &#383;pun 40 &#383;keins of good
linen yarn.

May 22. A corre&#383;pondent de&#383;ires us to mention, that at
John&#383;ton, a few days &#383;ince, four indu&#383;trious young
ladies, by "laying their fingers to the &#383;pindle, and their
hands to the di&#383;taff," completed, in one day, the
&#383;pinning and reeling of 21 fifteen-knotted &#383;keins of
good linen yarn. Would to God, that the Gentlemen at the
head of our political affairs in this State, were half &#383;o
zealous in encouraging our own manufactures, as the fair
&#383;ex are; who, at pre&#383;ent, de&#383;ervedly bear the palm, as
friends to their country.[Pg 93]

"Spinning Bee. On the 1st in&#383;t. a&#383;&#383;embled at the hou&#383;e
of the Rev. Samuel Deane of this town, more than one hundred
of the fair &#383;ex, married and &#383;ingle ladies, mo&#383;t of
whom, were &#383;killed in the important art of &#383;pinning. An
emulous indu&#383;try was never more apparent than in this
beautiful a&#383;&#383;embly. The majority of fair hands gave motion
to not le&#383;s than &#383;ixty wheels. Many were occupied in
preparing the materials, be&#383;ides tho&#383;e who attended to
the entertainment of the re&#383;t,&mdash;provi&#383;ion for which was
mo&#383;tly pre&#383;ented by the gue&#383;ts them&#383;elves, or &#383;ent
in by other generous promoters of the exhibition, as were
al&#383;o the materials for the work. Near the clo&#383;e of the
day Mrs. Deane was pre&#383;ented by the company, with two
hundred and thirty-&#383;ix, &#383;even-knotted &#383;keins of
excellent cotton and linen yarn, the work of the day,
excepting about a dozen &#383;keins, which &#383;ome of the
company brought in ready &#383;pun. Some had &#383;pun &#383;ix and
many not le&#383;s than five &#383;keins apiece. She takes this
opportunity of returning thanks to each, which the hurry of
the day rendered impracticable at the time. To conclude and
crown the day, a numerous band of the be&#383;t &#383;ingers
attended in the evening and performed an agreeable variety
of excellent pieces in psalmody. "The price of a virtuous
woman is far above rubies, * * * She layeth her hands to the
&#383;pindle and her hands hold the di&#383;taff."

When spinning-wheels ceased to be used altogether, we are not able to
say. Probably they were not in use for any great length of time after
the opening of the present century; but possibly in some country places
they were used down to the time of the War of 1812, and even later. We
are informed that in some remote places in Rhode Island and in Maine
spinning-wheels are in use to this day; but these are exceptional cases.

The "Massachusetts Centinel," April 30, 1788, has this advertisement:&mdash;

[Pg 95]

THE following very curious notice in the "Massachusetts Centinel" in
reference to funerals shows what had been customary upon such occasions;
the object of these "wholesome regulations" seemed to be to induce
economy. Gloves and rings were given to mourners in Salem to within the
last fifty or sixty years, and wines or liquors were also furnished.

TAKE NOTICE.

An economical plan of mourning was adopted, before the
Revolution, and its &#383;alutary effects have been experienced
by almo&#383;t every family in this town; &#383;ince which tho&#383;e
whole&#383;ome regulations have been pa&#383;&#383;ed into a law:
Notwith&#383;tanding which, it has lately been broken in upon
in &#383;everal in&#383;tances.&mdash;The In&#383;pectors of the
Police&mdash;that no one may hereafter plead ignorance, have
cau&#383;ed the law re&#383;pecting the &#383;ame to be publi&#383;hed,
and give notice, that any future breach of it, will be
pro&#383;ecuted without any favour or affection.

Bo&#383;ton, April 30, 1788.



To prevent exce&#383;s and vain expen&#383;e, in Mourning, &amp;c.

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, That in future no scarfs, gloves or
rings shall be given at any funeral in this town, nor shall
any wine, rum, or other spirituous liquor, be allowed or
given at, or immediately before or after, any funeral in
this[Pg 96] town, under pain that the person or persons giving,
allowing or ordering the same shall respectively forfeit and
pay the sum of twenty shillings for each offence.

And it is further ordered, That whatever male person shall
appear or walk in the procession of any funeral in this town
with any new mourning or new black or other new mourning
coat or waistcoat, or with any other new black apparel, save
and except a black crape around one arm, or shall afterwards
on account of the decease of any relation, or other person
or persons, put on and wear any other mourning than such
piece of black crape around one arm, shall forfeit and pay
the sum of twenty shillings for every day he shall put on
and wear or appear in the same.

AND no female, of whatsoever degree, shall put on, wear or
appear at any funeral in this town, in any other mourning or
new black clothes whatever, other than a black hat or
bonnet, black gloves, black ribbons and a black fan, on pain
to forfeit and pay the sum of twenty shillings; and also
forfeit and pay a like sum of twenty shillings for every
day she shall at any time at, or after such funeral, put on
wear or appear in such new black clothes, as or for
mourning, other than black hat, bonnet, black gloves, black
ribbons, and a black fan as aforesaid.



In 1790 the town of Salem published in the papers some regulations about
funerals; among the fees fixed were these:&mdash;

"For each Tolling of the Bell 8d."

"The &#383;extons are de&#383;ired to toll the Bells only four
&#383;trokes in a minute."[Pg 97]

"The undertakers service in borrowing chairs, waiting upon
the Pall-holders and warning the Relations &amp;c. to attend
8/."

"B. Daland and B. Brown are appointed by the Selectmen to
&#383;ee that Free Pa&#383;&#383;ages in the &#383;treets are kept open."
(This was before carriages were used at funerals.)



Extracts from Mr. Colman's Agricultural Address.

MANUFACTORIES AND THE SPINNING WHEEL.

"The establishment of extensive manufactories, and the
introduction of power-looms and spinning-jennies, has nearly
destroyed the usual household manufactures, and put our
other Jennies out of employment. Our ears are seldom greeted
now a days in the farmer's cottage with the flying of the
shuttle, or the deep base of the spinning wheel. We confess
that we have looked upon their departure with a strong
feeling of regret; and deem it no small abatement of the
advantages, which the establishment of extensive
manufactures has obviously yielded to the country, that it
removes the daughter from the shelter and security of the
paternal roof, and places her in a situation, which
certainly furnishes no means of qualifying her for the
proper department of woman; to preside over our domestic
establishments; to perform her part in the joint labors of
the household; and to know how and when and where to use,
prepare, and to apply to[Pg 98] the best advantage within doors,
the products of man's labor without doors. Many occupations
of female industry, strictly domestic however, of a healthy
and agreeable nature, are constantly presenting themselves,
so that there is little danger that the race of industrious
women, and accomplished wives, at least among the country
girls, will soon be extinct; and the silk culture, fast
gaining ground among us, promises to furnish an unexhausted
resource and a profitable employment of female labor."

Salem Observer, 1834.



In one of the numbers of the London "Spectator" for 1884 is an
interesting account of an attempt to revive the spinning-wheel industry
in England, through the kind offices of Mr. Albert Flemming, for the
purpose of helping poor women too old or blind to leave their homes for
other work. After considerable difficulty, a wheel was discovered among
a store of ancient articles; but no one at first knew how to use it.
Spinning was one of the lost arts, apparently. At length, however, an
old woman of eighty-four was found who understood the use of the wheel.
She taught Mr. Flemming how to spin. A few more old[Pg 99] wheels were found,
and some new ones constructed. Then it was some time before a loom could
be discovered. Eventually this was accomplished, and the art of weaving
taught. The account says that twenty women who were unable otherwise to
obtain a living, are now busily at work, happy in being able to provide
for their families. They make, it may be added, a good strong, honest
linen, specimens of which have been presented to Mr. Ruskin. This
account is substantially from the "Living Age," Nov. 1, 1884.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
