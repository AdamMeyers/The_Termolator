GERMAN PROBLEMS
AND PERSONALITIES



INTRODUCTION[1]
BY THE
LITERARY EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK &#8220;TIMES&#8221;


Three years ago there was one man in Europe who
had a political sight so clear that his words then
written seem to-day uncanny in their wisdom.[1]

This man saw the present war; he saw that Belgium
would be invaded by Germany; he saw that the
Germans hated England with a profound and bitter
hate; that German diplomatic blunders had placed
that nation in almost complete isolation in the world;
that the Triple Alliance was really only a Dual
Alliance, popular feeling in Italy becoming increasingly
hostile to Austria and to Prussia; that Germans felt
their culture to be superior to the civilization of the
rest of the world, and themselves to be a superior
race, with the right to rule other peoples; that
Prussianism and Junkerism and militarism were in
complete control of the German soul; that Germany
[2]had ambitions for world empire, a recurrence of &#8220;the
old Napoleonic dream&#8221;; that the danger to European
peace lay with Germany and not with England; that
Germans believed war to be essentially moral and the
mainspring of national progress; that the whole
German people had become Bismarckian; that the
Germans hoped to obtain by a victory over England
that shadowless place in the sun toward which they
began to leap when they beat France in 1870.

The seer who thus saw is Dr. Charles Sarolea, who
recently came to the United States in the interests of
his country, one of the most distinguished of Belgian
scholars, a friend of King Albert, holder of Belgian
decorations and honours from British learned societies,
for the last fourteen years Belgian Consul in Edinburgh,
and for the last twenty-one years head of the
French and Romance Department at the University
of Edinburgh. His vision was set out in &#8220;The
Anglo-German Problem,&#8221; written in 1912, now published
in an authorized American edition, perhaps
the most accurate forecast which has been penned
of to-day&#8217;s conflict, and certainly one of the most
exact analyses of the German nation made before the
world learned, since last August, to know it as it is&mdash;as
Sarolea, master delineator of a nation&#8217;s character,
drew it. Clear, sane, calm, logical, strong&mdash;such is
Dr. Sarolea&#8217;s book, with its &#8220;rare perspicacity&#8221;
and &#8220;remarkable sense of political realities,&#8221; in the
words of King Albert&#8217;s appreciation of the work.

Dr. Sarolea, looking at Germany from the British
Isles, where he was writing, perceived that &#8220;war is
actually unavoidable&#8221; unless a spiritual miracle
was wrought; that Europe was &#8220;drifting slowly but[3]
steadily toward an awful catastrophe.&#8221; Why?
Because Germany was strong, envious, ambitious,
conceited, arrogant, unscrupulous, and dissatisfied.
It was in Germany that &#8220;the pagan gods of the
Nibelungen are forging their deadly weapons,&#8221; for
Germans believe national superiority is due to military
superiority. Dr. Sarolea named as a war year this
very year[2] in which we now are when he said:

&#8220;Believing, as they do, that to-day they are rich
and prosperous mainly because in 1870 they beat
the French people, why should they not believe
and trust that in 1915 they would become even
stronger and richer if they succeeded in beating the
English?&#8221;

And the conflict, when it comes, will be &#8220;a political
and religious crusade,&#8221; rather than a mere economic
war, for the conflict between England and Germany
&#8220;is the old conflict between liberalism and despotism,
between industrialism and militarism, between progress
and reaction, between the masses and the classes.&#8221;

So many other important points are made in
Dr. Sarolea&#8217;s closely written book, in which practically
every sentence contains a fact, an idea, or a prophecy,
that it is not possible in this review to do more than
present a few of them in the summary which follows.
Though the present tense is used by Dr. Sarolea and
the reviewer, it should be constantly remembered
that Dr. Sarolea was thinking in 1912, not since
August, 1914.

Germany is in &#8220;tragic moral isolation.&#8221; The
moral and intellectual influence of German culture
is steadily diminishing. Other nations feel a universal
[4]distrust and dislike toward Germany. So great is
this antipathy that the Germans imagine there is a
malignant conspiracy against them. An upstart nation,
suddenly wealthy and powerful, Germany has developed
an inordinate self-conceit and self-assertion.
The German glories in being a realist. He thinks
only of political power and colonial expansion.
Might is the supreme test of right. He constantly
emphasizes the indelible character of the German
race. Germans are suffering from &#8220;acute megalomania.&#8221;
They think the English decadent, the
French doomed to premature extinction, the Russians
&#8220;rotten.&#8221; Germany is the &#8220;reactionary force in
international politics.&#8221;

England believes the building of the German
Navy is mainly directed against her, though Germany
says she is building to protect her colonies and
commerce. Yet it is not reasonably possible so to
account for the German fleet.

The greatest danger to England is not invasion
of the British Isles, but invasion of Belgium and
France. These countries are the &#8220;Achilles heel of
the British Empire.&#8221; The German strategic railways
on the Belgian frontiers show that Germany is far
more likely to invade Belgium than England, Belgium
again becoming the cockpit of Europe.

Germany feels that she has grievances against
England; thus her hatred. She thinks England has
checked her commercial expansion. But this is not
true, for English Free Trade has been one of the most
important contributory causes of German prosperity.

Germany thinks England has arrested her colonial
expansion; Germany says every other great nation[5]
but herself has been permitted to build up a colonial
empire; thus she is prevented from attaining her
natural growth. But this is not true. England
could not have checked her colonial aspirations,
because Germany had no colonial aspirations until
recently. When Germany did start to seek colonies,
she met everywhere conflicting claims of England,
but this was because England was already in possession,
having begun her colonial policy years before
Germany entered the race. Bismarck was largely
responsible for Germany&#8217;s now having so small a
colonial territory.

Germany thinks she has another grievance&mdash;that
England has hemmed her in with a ring of enemies.
But Germany is friendless because of her mistakes.
Bismarck alienated the Russians for ever in 1878 at
the Treaty of Berlin, making a Franco-Russian
understanding unavoidable. The Kruger telegram
of 1896, the outburst of anti-British feeling during
the Boer War, the German naval programme, opened
England&#8217;s eyes to her danger; thus was England
forced to seek France and Russia.

The Kaiser is intensely religious, claiming to be
&#8220;the anointed of the Lord.&#8221; Yet he is a materialist,
an opportunist, and mainly trusts to brute force.
The navy is his creation. He brandishes the sword,
saying he loves peace. Napoleon III. used to express
his love for peace, yet brought on the most disastrous
war of French history; Nicholas II. started as the
peacemaker of Europe, yet brought about the bloodiest
war in Russian history. &#8220;Are the Kaiser&#8217;s pacific
protests as futile, are his sympathies as shallow, as
those of a Napoleon or a Nicholas?[6]&#8221;

Dr. Sarolea closes his book thus:

&#8220;We can only hope that England, which to-day
more than any other country&mdash;more, even, than
republican France&mdash;represents the ideals of a pacific
and industrial democracy, may never be called upon
to assert her supremacy in armed conflict, and to
safeguard those ideals against a wanton attack on
the part of the most formidable and most systematic
military power the world has ever seen.&#8221;

FOOTNOTES:

[1] One of the most eminent American theologians, Bishop Brent,
wrote in an article on &#8220;Speculation and Prophecy&#8221;: &#8220;In Dr.
Sarolea&#8217;s volume, &#8216;The Anglo-German Problem,&#8217; published in 1912,
there is a power of precognition so startling that one can understand
a sceptic of the twenty-first century raising serious doubts
as to whether parts of it were not late interpolation.&#8221; Mr. Gilbert
Keith Chesterton in his &#8220;Crimes of England&#8221; applied to the
&#8220;Anglo-German Problem&#8221; the epithet &#8220;almost magical.&#8221;

CHAPTER I[7]

AN AMERICAN PREFACE[3]


I.

The book of which a new and popular edition is
now presented to the American public has very little
in common with the thousand and one war publications
which are distracting the attention of a bewildered
and satiated reader. It was not compiled
in feverish haste since the war began. It was
written years before the war, and represents the outcome
of two decades of study and travel in Germany.

The volume was first published in 1912 to dispel
the false sense of security which was blinding
European opinion to the imminent perils ahead,
to warn Britain of the appalling catastrophe towards
which all nations were drifting, and to give an accurate
estimate of the forces which were making for
war. I attempted to prove that Germany and not
Britain or France or Russia was the storm-centre
of international politics. I attempted to prove that
the differences between Germany and Britain were
not due to substantial grievances, but that those
grievances were purely imaginary; that such catch-phrases
as taking Germany&#8217;s place in the sun were
[8]entirely misleading, and that both the grievances and
the catch-phrases were merely diverting the public
mind from the one real issue at stake, the clash and
conflict between two irreconcilable political creeds&mdash;the
Imperialism of Great Britain, granting equal
rights to all, based on Free Trade, and aiming at a
federation of self-governing communities; and the
Imperialism of Germany, based on despotism and
antagonism and aiming at the military ascendancy
of one Power over subject races.

I further attempted to show how the German
people were in the grip of the Prussian military
machine, of a reactionary bureaucracy, and of a
Prussian feudal Junkerthum; how behind that military
machine and that feudal Junkerthum there were
even more formidable moral and spiritual forces at
work; how the whole German nation were under the
spell of a false political creed; how the Universities,
the Churches, the Press, were all possessed with the
same exclusive nationalism; and how, being misled
by its spiritual leaders, the whole nation was honestly
and intensely convinced that in the near future the
German Empire must challenge the world in order to
establish its supremacy over the Continent of Europe.


II.

Habent sua fata libelli! Motley&#8217;s &#8220;Rise of the
Dutch Republic&#8221; was refused by the illustrious
house of Murray. The now historical &#8220;Foundations&#8221;
of Chamberlain were rejected for twenty
years by English publishers, until the translation
brought a little fortune to Mr. John Lane. Without[9]
in the least suggesting a comparison with those
famous works, I only want to point out that the
&#8220;Anglo-German Problem&#8221; has passed through as
strange literary vicissitudes. A book written by a
sympathetic and devoted student of German literature,
and who for twenty years had been working
for the diffusion of German culture, was denounced
as anti-German. A book inspired from the first
page to the last with pacific and democratic ideals
was denounced as a militarist and mischievous
production. A temperate judicial analysis was dubbed
as alarmist and sensational and bracketed with the
scaremongerings of the Yellow Press. The radical
Daily News of London dismissed my volume with a
contemptuous notice. The Edinburgh reviewer of
the Scotsman pompously declared that such a book
could do no good.

To-day both the Press and the public have made
ample if belated amends for the unjust treatment
meted out to the &#8220;Anglo-German Problem&#8221; on its
first appearance. His Majesty King Albert has
emphasized the prophetic character of the book, and
has paid it the high compliment of recommending it
to members of his Government. University statesmen
like President Butler, eminent lawyers like Mr.
James Beck, illustrious philosophers like Professor
Bergson, have testified to its fairness, its moderation,
and its political insight. Almost unnoticed on its
publication in 1912, the &#8220;Anglo-German Problem&#8221;
is to-day one of the three books on the war most
widely read throughout the British Empire, and is
being translated into the French, Dutch, and Spanish
languages.[10]


III.

Not only have the principles and general conclusions
propounded in the &#8220;Anglo-German Problem&#8221;
received signal confirmation from recent events, but
the forecasts and anticipations have been verified
in every detail. It is the common fate of war books
to become very quickly out of date. After four
years, there is not one paragraph which has been
contradicted by actual fact. Even the chapter on
the Baghdad Railway, written in 1906 and published
as a separate pamphlet nine years ago, remains
substantially correct. One of the leading magnates
of Wall Street wrote to me: &#8220;Events have not only
unfolded themselves in the way you anticipated,
but they have happened for the identical reasons
which you indicated.&#8221; I pointed out the fatal
peril of the Austrian-Serbian differences and of the
Drang nach Osten policy, and it is those Serbian-Austrian
differences which have precipitated the war.
I prophesied that the invasion of Belgium and not
the invasion of England was the contingency to be
dreaded, and Belgium has become the main theatre
of military operations. I emphasized that the
conflict was one of fundamental moral and political
ideals rather than of economic interests, and the war
has developed into a religious crusade. I prophesied
that the war would be long and cruel, and it has
proved the most ruthless war of modern times.

All the forces which I prophesied would make for
war have made for war: the reactionary policy of the
Junkerthum, the internal troubles, the personality
of the Kaiser, the propaganda of the Press and of the[11]
Universities. Similarly, the forces which were expected
to make for peace, and which I prophesied
would not make for peace, have failed to work for
peace. Few publicists anticipated that the millions
of German Social Democrats would behave as timid
henchmen of the Prussian Junker, and my friend
Vandervelde, leader of the International Social
Democracy and now Belgian Minister of State,
indignantly repudiated my reflections on his German
comrades. Alas! the Gospel according to St. Marx
has been as ineffectual as the Gospel according to
St. Marc. The Social Democracy which called itself
the International (with a capital I) has proved
selfishly nationalist, and the masses which had not
the courage to fight for their rights under Kaiser Bebel
are now slaughtering their French and English
brethren, and are meekly enlisted in the legions of
Kaiser William.

The &#8220;Anglo-German Problem,&#8221; written by a writer of
Belgian origin who foresaw the catastrophe threatening
his native country, will be followed up shortly by
another book on the &#8220;Reconstruction of Belgium.&#8221;
Belgium has been not only the champion of European
freedom; she has also been the innocent victim of the
old order. It is only in the fitness of things that after
the war Belgium shall become the keystone of the
new International Order. The whole of Europe is
ultimately responsible for the Belgian tragedy. The
whole of Europe must therefore be interested in and
pledged to the restoration of Belgium and to the
liberation of the Belgian people, now crushed and
bleeding under the heel of the Teutonic invader.

CHAPTER II[12]

MY FORECASTS OF 1906 AND 1912[4]


I.&mdash;We are Drifting into War.

&#8220;Europe is drifting slowly but steadily towards an
awful catastrophe, which, if it does happen, will
throw back civilization for the coming generation,
as the war of 1870 threw back civilization for the
generation which followed and which inherited its
dire legacy of evil. For the last ten years two
great Western Powers and two kindred races have
become increasingly estranged, and have been engaging
in military preparations which are taxing to
the utmost the resources of the people, and are
paralyzing social and political reform in both
countries. A combination of many causes, moral
and political, has bred suspicion and distrust, and
the fallacious assumption of conflicting interests
has turned suspicion into hatred. Only a year ago
England and Germany stood on the brink of war.
If, after the coup of Agadir, Germany had persisted
in her policy, the conflagration would have ensued,
the storm would have burst out. The war-cloud
has temporarily lifted, but it has not passed away.
[13]The danger is as acute as it was, because the causes
which produced the recent outburst are still with
us, and the malignant passions are gathering strength
with each passing day.

This formidable evil is threatening England, but
it does not originate in England, and England
cannot be held responsible for it. The period of
aggressive Imperialism has passed away. Mr. Joseph
Chamberlain and Mr. Rudyard Kipling, in so far
as they once represented the old bellicose Imperialism,
to-day are exploded forces. The English people
were never more peacefully inclined, and Liberals
and Tories are united in their desire for a pacific
solution of the present difficulties.

It is Germany and not England which is the
storm-centre, the volcanic zone, in international
politics. From there have come, ever since 1860,
the tension and friction, the suspicion and distrust.
It is there that the pagan gods of the Nibelungen
are forging their deadly weapons.&#8221;


II.&mdash;The Strength of Anti-British Feeling
in Germany.

&#8220;German and English publicists, whilst admitting
the existence of a feeling of hostility, point out the
many unmistakable signs of goodwill heralding a
better understanding in the future. They point to
the frequent exchange of international courtesies, to
the periodical visits of Members of Parliament and
of representative men of the Churches; they point
to the visit of Viscount Haldane; and last, but not
least, they point to the many pacific assurances of[14]
the German Kaiser. With regard to the utterances
of the Kaiser, I can only say that if the Kaiser has
made many pacific speeches, his aggressive speeches
have been even more numerous. I have no doubt
that the Kaiser is perfectly sincere, and I believe
him to be animated with the most cordial feelings
for this country. If I am asked to explain the
contradiction, I can only see one explanation, and
it is not one which I am very willing to admit. And
the explanation is this: when he is expressing words of
peace and goodwill he is speaking in his own private
capacity and as the grandson of an English queen.
On the contrary, whenever he utters words of ill-will
and menace, whenever he waves the flag, when
he shows the mailed fist, he is acting as the representative
and speaking as the spokesman of a considerable
fraction amongst his subjects.

That there has existed in Germany a very widespread
feeling of hostility against the English people
we have uncontrovertible proof. And the evidence
we have on no less an authority than the Kaiser
himself. In the famous interview published by the
Daily Telegraph, William II. emphatically testified
to the existence and to the persistence of the feeling
which he had systematically attempted to counteract.
The admission raised legitimate indignation
in Germany. It was ill-advised. It was calculated
to intensify the very animosity which it deprecated.
But the fact itself, the existence of the animosity,
could not be disputed. After all, the Kaiser ought
to know the feelings, if not of the majority of his
subjects, at least of those ruling classes with whom
he comes in contact.[15]&#8221;


III.&mdash;War the German Ideal and the
German Idol.

&#8220;Contemporary German philosophy is a &#8216;war
philosophy.&#8217; In France we may find isolated thinkers,
like Joseph de Maistre, who are the apostles of war,
who maintain that war is a Divine and providential
institution, one of the eternal verities. In
Germany the paradoxes of de Maistre are the
commonplaces of historians and moralists. To an
Englishman war is a dwindling force, an anachronism.
It may still sometimes be a necessity, a dura lex,
an ultima ratio, but it is always a monstrous calamity.
In other words, to an Englishman war is evil, war
is immoral. On the contrary, to the German war is
essentially moral. Indeed, it is the source of the
highest morality, of the most valuable virtues, and
without war the human race would speedily degenerate.
It is the mainspring of national progress.
There are three causes which have ensured the present
greatness of the German Empire: moral virtue in
the individual, political unity, and economic prosperity.
If we were to believe modern theorists,
Germany owes all three to the beneficent action of
war. Germany is not indebted for its culture to the
genius of its writers or artists, but to the iron and blood
of its statesmen and warriors. It is the glorious
triumvirate of Bismarck, Moltke, and von Roon
who have been the master-builders of the Vaterland.

Our main contention is, that as the pacific philosophy
of Herder and Kant, of Goethe and Lessing,
provides the key to the old Germany described in[16]
Madame de Sta&euml;l&#8217;s masterpiece, even so the military
philosophy of Mommsen and Treitschke, of Bismarck
and Nietzsche, gives us the key of modern Prussianized
Germany. The whole German people have become
Bismarckian, and believe that it is might which
creates right. The whole of the younger generation
have become Nietzschean in politics, and believe in
the will to power&mdash;der Wille zur Macht. That political
philosophy is to-day the living and inspiring ideal
which informs German policy. And it is that philosophy
which we have to keep constantly in mind if
we wish to understand the currents and under-currents
of contemporary politics and make a correct
forecast of the future; if we wish to distinguish
between what is real and unreal in international
relations, between the professions of politicians and
the aims and aspirations of the people. German
statesmen may protest about their love of peace,
but the service they render to peace is only lip service.
Peace is only a means, war is the goal. We are reminded
of Professor Delbr&uuml;ck&#8217;s assertion that, considering
the infinitely complex conditions of modern
warfare, many years of peace are necessary to and
must be utilized for the preparation of the wars
which are to come.

How, then, can we be reassured by any German
pacifist protests and demonstrations? How can
we believe that German peace is anything more than
a precarious truce as long as German statesmen,
German thinkers, German teachers and preachers,
unanimously tell us that the philosophy of war is
the only gospel of salvation? How can a patriotic
German, if he is consistent, abstain eventually from[17]
waging war when he is firmly convinced that his
country owes her political unity, her moral temper,
and her Imperial prosperity, whatever she is and
whatever she has, mainly to the agency of war?
When war has done so much for Germany in the
past, will it not do greater things for Germany in the
future?

War may be a curse or it may be a blessing. If
war is a curse, then the wells of public opinion have
been poisoned in Germany, perhaps for generations
to come. If war is a blessing, if the philosophy of
war is indeed the gospel of the super-man, sooner or
later the German people are bound to put that gospel
into practice. They must look forward with anxious
and eager desire to the glorious day when once more
they are able to fight the heroic battles of Teutonism,
when they are able to fulfil the providential destinies
of the German super-race, the chosen champions of
civilization.&#8221;


IV.&mdash;Why Germany has kept the Peace.

&#8220;Uninfluenced by those ominous signs of the times,
English and German optimists still refuse to surrender,
still persist in their optimism. They argue that the
situation is no doubt serious, but that those outbursts
of popular feeling in Germany, violent as
they are, have largely been caused by English
suspicion and distrust, and that there has been
nothing in the German policy to justify that English
suspicion and distrust. After all, deeds are more
important than words, and by her deeds Germany
has proved for forty-two years that she is persistently[18]
pacific. Since 1870 Russia has made war against
Turkey and against Japan. England has made
war against the Transvaal. Italy has waged war
against Turkey. France after Fashoda would have
declared war against England, and after Tangier
would have declared war against Germany, if France
had been prepared. Of all the Great Powers, Germany
alone for nearly half a century has been determined
to keep the peace of the world.

The reply to this objection is very simple. I am
not examining here whether a state of affairs which
has transformed Europe into an armed camp of six
million soldiers, and which absorbs for military
expenditure two-thirds of the revenue of European
States, can be appropriately called a state of peace.
It is certainly not a pax romana. It is most certainly
not a pax britannica. It may be a pax teutonica or,
rather, a pax borussica, but such as it is, ruinous and
demoralizing, it is also lamentably precarious and
perilously unstable. And if Germany has kept this
pax borussica for forty-two years, it has not been the
fault of the German Government. Rather has it
been kept because she has been prevented from
declaring war by outside interference; or because
she has been able to carry out her policy and to achieve
her ambitions without going the length of declaring
war; or because a war would have been not only a
heinous crime, but a political blunder.

But the real reason why Germany for forty years
has kept the peace is because a war would have been
both fatal and futile, injurious and superfluous.
It would have been injurious, for it would have
arrested the growing trade and the expanding[19]
industries of the empire. And, above all, it would
have been superfluous, for in time of peace Germany
reaped all the advantages which a successful war
would have given her. For twenty-five years the
German Empire wielded an unchallenged supremacy
on the Continent of Europe. For twenty years she
directed the course of international events.

But since the opening of the twentieth century
Germany has ceased to be paramount; she has ceased
to control European policy at her own sweet will,
and weaker States have ceased to be given over to her
tender mercies. To the Triple Alliance has been
opposed the Triple Entente. The balance of power
has been re-established. The three &#8216;hereditary
enemies&#8217;&mdash;England, France, and Russia&mdash;have
joined hands, and have delivered Europe from the incubus
of German suzerainty. German diplomacy has
strained every effort to break the Triple Entente, in
turn wooing and threatening France and Russia,
keeping open the Moroccan sore as the Neapolitan
lazzarone keeps open the wound which ensures his
living, and finally challenging the naval supremacy
of England, and preparing to become as powerful at
sea as she is on the Continent.&#8221;


V.&mdash;The Political Preparation of War.

&#8220;Precisely because the final issue will largely depend
on the personality of the soldier, the moral and civic
preparation must be at least as important as the
technical, and here the Government has an important
part to play through the school and through the
Press. Both the school and the Press must both persistently[20]
emphasize the meaning and the necessity of
war as an indispensable means of policy and of culture,
and must inculcate the duty of personal sacrifice.
To achieve that end the Government must have
its own popular papers, whose aim it will be to stimulate
patriotism, to preach loyalty to the Kaiser, to
resist the disintegrating influence of Social Democracy.

But not least important is the political preparation
for the war. Statesmanship and diplomacy confine
themselves too much to consolidating alliances and
entering into new understandings. Nothing could be
more dangerous than to rely too much on treaties
and alliances. Alliances are not final. Agreements
are only conditional. They are only binding, rebus
sic stantibus, as long as conditions remain the same&mdash;as
long as it is in the interest of the allies to keep
them; for nothing can compel a State to act against
its own interest, and there is no alliance or bond in
the world which can subsist if it is not based on the
mutual advantage of both parties. It is therefore
essential that the war shall be fought under such
conditions that it shall be in the interest of every
ally to be loyal to his engagements; and therefore
it is essential for the State so to direct and combine
political events as to produce a conjuncture of
interests and to provoke the war at the most favourable
moment.&#8221;


VI.&mdash;The Imaginary German Grievances.

&#8220;England cannot honestly admit the truth and
reality of German grievances. England cannot admit
that in the past she has ever adopted an attitude of[21]
contemptuous superiority towards the German people.
Still less can England admit that she has systematically
stood in the way of German colonial ambitions.
She cannot admit it, for the simple reason that only
a few years ago those German colonial ambitions did
not exist. Almost to the end of his long rule, Bismarck
would not have colonies, and he deliberately
encouraged France in that policy of African expansion
which Germany now objects to. Germany
would probably have had a much larger colonial
empire if she had chosen to have it. History teaches
us that in the development of European colonization
there are some nations, like the Spaniards and Portuguese,
that have come too early in the field. There
are other nations, like England and Russia, that have
come in the nick of time. And, finally, there are
nations that have come too late. The German
people have arrived too late in the race for colonial
empire. They may regret it, but surely it would
be monstrous to use the fact as a grievance against
the people of this country. I may bitterly regret
that twenty years ago I had not the money or the
energy or the foresight to invest in the development
of Argentine, or that I did not buy an estate in Canada,
which in those early days I might have got for a
hundred pounds, and which to-day would be worth
hundreds of thousands. But that is no reason why
I should hate the present possessors of landed property
in the Far West or in the Far South. That is no
reason why I should wish to dispossess them of land
which they have legitimately acquired, whether they
owe it to their luck or to their pluck, to favourable
circumstances or to their initiative and perseverance.[22]&#8221;


VII.&mdash;The Pacific Meaning of the Entente.

&#8220;The new grouping of Powers, which has reduced
Germany from a position of sole supremacy to a
position of equality, is not the result of any artificial
combinations of diplomacy. Still less is it the result
of a conspiracy, inspired by English envy and English
hatred. It was not initiated by Edward VII. It
has survived his death. To assume that England
would have been capable of isolating Germany by
her own single efforts, and in order to serve her own
selfish purposes, is to attribute to England a power
which she does not wield. If there has been a conspiracy,
France, Italy, Russia, and the United States,
inhabited by twenty million citizens who are German
by birth or by descent, have all been willing accomplices.
The Triple Entente has been a spontaneous
revolt of Europe against German aggressiveness and
German militarism.

England has not attempted to isolate Germany.
She has only herself emerged from her isolation.
If she can be accused of having made a grievous
mistake in her foreign policy, it is that of having been
blind for so long to the perils which threatened
European liberty. Since 1870 she has submitted for
twenty-five years to German predominance, because
she had to oppose the colonial ambitions of France
in Africa and the ambitions of Russia in Asia. To-day
England has returned to her ancient traditions.
She has never suffered for any length of time, and will
never suffer as long as she remains a first-class Power,
from the exclusive predominance of any one Continental[23]
nation. She has ever fought for the maintenance
of the balance of power. She defended that
balance against Charles V. and Philip II. in the
sixteenth century, against Louis XIV. in the seventeenth,
against Napoleon, against Nicholas I., and
Alexander II. in the nineteenth century. She defends
it to-day against William II. But she is no more
the enemy of Germany to-day than she was the enemy
of France or Russia ten years ago. And if the equilibrium
of Europe were threatened to-morrow by Russia,
as it is threatened to-day by Germany, England would
become to-morrow the ally of Germany.

It may be contended, no doubt, that in opposing
the supremacy of another empire on land, she is
only defending her own supremacy on the sea. But
the history of four hundred years convincingly shows
that England in defending her own interests has
always been fighting the battles of European liberty.
And to-day more than ever, when Europe is transformed
into an armed camp, when might has become
the criterion of right, when all nations are living in
perpetual dread of a European conflagration, the
strict adherence of England to her old principle of
the balance of power remains the best sanction of
international law and the surest guarantee of the peace
of the world.&#8221;


VIII.&mdash;German Megalomania.

&#8220;Whatever may be the cause of the state of mind
of the Germans, they are certainly suffering just
now from acute &#8216;megalomania.&#8217; The abnormal self-conceit,[24]
the inflated national consciousness, express
themselves in a thousand ways, some of which are
na&iuml;ve and harmless, whilst others are grossly offensive.
They show themselves in a craving for titles and in
gaudy and tasteless public buildings;[5] in the thousand
and one statues of Bismarck and William I.; they
reveal themselves in the articles of journalists and in
the writings of historians; but above all, the German
megalomania finds expression in the seven thousand
speeches and in the three hundred uniforms of the
Kaiser. In examining the influence of William II.
we shall come to the conclusion that it is his defects
far more than his virtues that have made him the
representative hero of the German people. His
winged words voice the aspirations of his subjects.
Like the Kaiser, every German believes that he is
&#8216;the salt of the earth&#8217;&mdash;Wir sind das Salz der Erde.
Like Nietzsche, the modern German believes that the
world must be ruled by a super-man, and that he
is the super-man. Like Houston Stewart Chamberlain,
the German is convinced that he belongs to a
super-race, and that the Teuton has been the master-builder
of European civilization.&#8221;


IX.&mdash;German Self-Assertion.

&#8220;The self-assertion of the Germans and the contempt
for the foreigner reveal themselves in their
political dealings with other nations. German statesmen
continue the methods of Bismarck without
having his genius. German politicians delight in
[25]shaking the mailed fist, in waving the national
banner with the Imperial black eagle, the ominous
and symbolical bird of prey. Wherever they meet
with opposition they at once resort to comminatory
messages. Compare the methods of the Emperor
William with those of Edward VII. Nothing illustrates
better the differences between the characteristics
of English and German diplomacy than the
dramatic contrast between the bragging, indiscreet,
impulsive, explosive manner of the Kaiser and the
quiet, courteous manner of the English monarch.
Nothing explains better the striking success which
has attended English policy and the no less striking
failure which has attended German policy. For in
international as well as in private relations, intellectual
superiority is often as efficient a weapon as
an appeal to brute force. And all the might of the
German Empire has not saved the German foreign
policy from persistent bankruptcy. That bankruptcy
is unanimously admitted even in Germany,
and partly accounts for the present temper of the
nation. The times have changed, and even the weak
cannot now be bullied into submission. At the
Algeciras Conference even those small nations whose
most obvious interest it was to side with Germany
gave their moral support to France.&#8221;


X.&mdash;Germany stands for Reaction.

&#8220;There still remains for us to examine one deeper
reason why Germany is distrusted and disliked in
Europe. She is mainly distrusted because she continues[26]
to be the reactionary force in international
politics. Outside the sphere of German influence
the democratic ideal has triumphed all over the
civilized world, after centuries of heroic struggle and
tragic catastrophes. But in Germany the old dogma
is still supreme. Wherever German power has
made itself felt for the last forty years&mdash;in Italy and
Austria, in Russia and Turkey&mdash;it has countenanced
reaction and tyranny. In politics Germany is to-day
what Austria and Russia were in the days of the Holy
Alliance, the power of darkness. Whilst in the
provinces of science and art the German people are
generally progressive, in politics the German Government
is consistently retrogressive. It cannot be
sufficiently emphasized and repeated that, more than
any other State&mdash;more even than Russia&mdash;Prussia
stands in the way of political advance. It was
Prussia that helped to crush the Polish struggle for
freedom in 1863; when, a few years ago, English
public opinion was protesting against the Armenian
massacres, the Kaiser stood loyally by Abdul Hamid
and propped his tottering throne; when the Russian
Liberals were engaged in a life-and-death struggle
with Czardom, the Kaiser gave his moral support to
Russian despotism. It is not too much to say that
it is the evil influence of Prusso-Germany alone which
keeps despotism alive in the modern world.&#8221;


XI.&mdash;Prussia controls Germany.

&#8220;It is difficult to exaggerate the political domination
of Germany by Prussia. The practice belies the
theory: it is not as German Emperor but as Prussian[27]
King that William II. rules the confederation.
The larger is merged in the smaller. The poor
barren plains of Brandenburg and Pomerania rule
over the smiling vineyards and romantic mountains
of the south and west. The German people are
governed more completely from Berlin and Potsdam
than the French were ever governed from Paris and
Versailles. And they are governed with an iron hand.
In theory, every part of the empire may have a proportional
share in the administration of the country;
in reality, Prussia has the ultimate political and
financial control. Germany pays the taxes; Prussia
spends them. Germany provides the soldiers; Prussia
commands them. And the Prussian War Lord and his
Junkers in the last resort decide the issues of peace
and war.

To realize how complete is the Prussian control
we need only consider the fact that in the supreme
Federal Parliament&mdash;the Bundesrat&mdash;for forty-two
years the Prussian representatives have always had
it their own way. Yet Prussia, according to the
Constitution, has only got seventeen delegates out
of fifty-two. When the Imperial Constitution was
framed it was thought that the Prussian representation
was far too small, and the fear was repeatedly
expressed that the Prussian vote in the Bundesrat
would be overruled. But not once has it happened
that the German majority in the Bundesrat has
dared to oppose any important measure initiated by
the Prussian Government. For all practical purposes,
therefore, Prussia is the suzerain power. The German
principalities and kingdoms are reduced to political
tutelage and subjection.[28]&#8221;


XII.&mdash;Why Prussia has enslaved Germany.

&#8220;How shall we explain this startling paradox?
How is it, and why is it, that the artistic and exuberant,
genial and sentimental German submits to
the hard rule of the commonplace, uninteresting,
and dour Prussian?

If you ask ninety-nine out of a hundred Germans
they will not give you a reply. They know too little
of and care too little about politics to be even aware
of the fact. They are satisfied with appearances.
They do not see the King of Prussia behind the
German Kaiser. They are hypnotized by the glittering
helmet of the War Lord.

But if you succeed in discovering one in a hundred
who understands the relation between Germany and
Prussia, and who has thought out the political
problem, he will probably give you something like
the following reply:

&#8216;I know that there is no love lost between the
Germans and the Prussians. I know that in culture
and native ability we are as superior to the Prussians
as our vine-clad hills are superior in beauty to the
sandy wastes of Pomerania. And I know that in
politics we play a subordinate part, although we are
superior. But I also realize that it is necessary for
us to submit. And it is necessary for us to submit,
precisely because of our virtues. For those virtues
of ours are unpractical. And it is necessary for the
Prussians to rule, precisely because of their shortcomings.
For those shortcomings are practical.
The pure gold of the German temper could never be[29]
made into hard coin nor used to advantage. It
could be made to produce splendid works of art,
gems and diadems and ornaments, but for practical
purposes, in order to forge the weapons of the Nibelungen,
the alloy of the baser metal was indispensable.
It required the mixture of Prussian sand and Prussian
iron to weld us into a nation, to raise us to an empire.
It is because we Germans are artists and dreamers and
individualists that we could never manage our own
affairs, that we have always been &#8220;non-political
animals.&#8221;[6] On the contrary, it is because the
Prussian has no brilliance, no romance, no personality,
that he makes a splendid soldier and a model bureaucrat.
Two things above all were required to make
Germany into a powerful State&mdash;a strong army and
a well-ordered administration. Prussia has given
us both.

&#8216;And let us not forget that Germany more than
any other Power required such a strong army and
such a strong administration, not only owing to the
shortcomings of her national character, but owing to
the weakness and danger of her geographical position.
Germany is open on every frontier. She has ever
been harassed by dangerous enemies. Only a generation
ago she was threatened on every side. On the
north she had to face the rulers of the sea, who
hampered her commercial expansion; on the west she
had to face the restless Gaul; on the south she was
confronted with the clerical and Jesuitical empire
of the Habsburg; on the east with the empire of the
[30]Romanovs. From all those enemies Prussia has
ultimately saved us. The Hohenzollern dynasty
has proved a match for them all.

&#8216;The whole annals of Germany and Prussia are
a striking proof of the political weakness of the
German and of the strength of the Prussian character.
Again and again Germany has witnessed magnificent
outbursts of national prosperity. She has seen the
might of the Hohenstaufen; she has seen the wealth
of the Hansa towns. Again and again she has
witnessed the spontaneous generation and blossoming
of civic prosperity; she has seen the glory and pride
of Nuremberg and Heidelberg, of Cologne and Frankfurt,
the art of D&uuml;rer and Holbein. But again and
again German culture has been nipped in the bud.
It has been destroyed by civil war and religious war,
by internal anarchy and foreign invasion. The
Thirty Years&#8217; War devastated every province of the
German Empire, and such was the misery and anarchy
that in many parts the people had reverted to
savagery and cannibalism.[7] And hardly had the
country recovered from the horrors of the wars of
religion, when repeated French invasions laid waste
the rich provinces of the Rhine and Palatinate.
So completely did German rulers of the eighteenth
century betray their duty to the people that some
Princes degraded themselves to the point of selling
their soldiers to the Hanoverian Kings in order to
fight the battles of England in America.

&#8216;Whilst the German Princes were thus squandering
the treasure and life-blood of their subjects, there
was growing up in the North a little State which was
[31]destined from the most unpromising beginnings for
the most glorious future. It is true that the little
Prussian State was wretchedly poor; for that very
reason the Prussian rulers had to practise strict
economy and unrelenting industry. It is true
the country was always insecure and constantly
threatened by powerful neighbours; for that very
reason the people had to submit to a rigid discipline
and a strong military organization. It is true the
country was depopulated; for that very reason the
rulers had to attract foreign settlers by a just, wise,
and tolerant government.&#8217;

A patriotic German might illustrate in the following
simple parable the complex and strange relations
between Germany and Prussia:

&#8216;The German people a century ago might be compared
to the heirs and owners of an ancient estate.
The estate was rich and of romantic beauty. The
heirs were clever, adventurous, and universally
popular. But although devoted to each other, they
could not get on together. Their personality was
too strong, and they were always quarrelling. Nor
could they turn to advantage their vast resources,
and the natural wealth of the estate only served to
attract outside marauders. They were so extravagant
and so unpractical that they would lay out beautiful
parks and build magnificent mansions whilst neglecting
to drain the land and to repair the fences.
They would spend lavishly on luxuries, but they
would grudge food to the cattle and manure to the
fields. Thus, with all their splendid possessions,
the German heirs were always on the verge of
bankruptcy.[32]

&#8216;To extricate themselves, they decided to accept
the services of a factor and manager. The factor was
the Prussian Junker. He was an alien. For he
could hardly be called a German. In blood he was
more Slav than Teutonic. He was unrefined, unsympathetic,
and overbearing. But as a manager
he was splendid. He bought up outlying parts to
round off the estate. He paid more attention to
the necessaries than to the luxuries and the amenities
of life. He was more careful to surround himself
with a strong police force than with poets and
minstrels. But he was able to keep out the marauders
and the poachers. He was able to protect the property
against stronger neighbours and to bully the weaker
neighbours into surrendering desirable additions to
the estate. In a short time the heirs, formerly universally
popular, were cordially hated in the land.
But their rents had increased by leaps and bounds,
and the German estate had been rounded off and made
into one solid and compact whole.&#8217;

Such, German writers would tell us, is the parable
of Germany and Prussia. The Germans are the gifted,
generous, and spendthrift heirs to an illustrious
domain. Prussia is the alien, upstart, unpopular,
unsympathetic, bullying factor and manager. But
to this bullying factor Germany owes the consolidation
and prosperity of the national estate.&#8221;


XIII.&mdash;The German Reichstag as a Debating
Club.

&#8220;We are apt to forget that, strictly speaking, a
Parliamentary government does not exist in Germany,
although we constantly speak of a &#8216;German Parliament.[33]&#8217;
According to the Constitution, the Chancellor
is not responsible to Parliament, he is only
responsible to the Emperor. There is no Cabinet
or delegation of the majority of the Reichstag.
There is no party system. There are only party
squabbles. I do not know whether Mr. Belloc
would approve of the German Constitution, but it
certainly enables the Government to soar high above
all the parties in the Reichstag. German Liberals
may be morally justified in their struggle against
political reaction, but technically the Government
are acting within their constitutional right. And
when, therefore, the Reichstag attempts to control
the executive, it is rather the Reichstag which is
unconstitutional. On the other hand, when the
Emperor asserts his Divine right, it is he who is true
to the spirit of the Constitution; he is only giving
a religious interpretation and colour to a political
prerogative which he undoubtedly possesses. And
not only is there no Parliamentary government, but
there is not even a desire, except with a small fraction
of Radicals, to possess such a government. Prussian
publicists again and again tell us that Germany does
not want to copy English institutions. The old
German monarchic institutions are good enough for
Germany. Read the treatise of Treitschke, the
great historian and political philosopher of modern
Prussia. He systematically attempts to belittle
every achievement of the Parliamentary system; and
every prominent writer follows in his footsteps.
Prussia has not produced a Guizot, a Tocqueville,
a Stuart Mill, or a Bryce. Her thinkers are all imbued
with the traditions of enlightened despotism.[34]
Even the great Mommsen cannot be adduced as an
exception. He makes us forget his Liberalism, and
only remember his C&aelig;sarism.

The powers of the Reichstag are very limited.
It is mainly a machine for voting supplies, but even
that financial control is more nominal than real.
For under the Constitution the Assembly must needs
make provision for the army and navy, which are
outside and above party politics. And having
previously fixed the contingent of the Imperial forces,
the army and navy estimates must needs follow. In
the present tension of international politics, a reduction
is out of the question. Theoretically, the
Reichstag can indeed oppose an increase, but practically
the increase is almost automatic. The Reichstag
could only postpone it, and in so doing would have to
face unpopularity. Every party vies with its rivals
in sacrificing their principles on the altar of patriotism.
Whereas the Catholic party in Belgium has for
twenty-eight years refused the means of national
defence, and has made the Belgian Army into a byword
on the plea that barrack life is dangerous to the
religious faith of the peasant, the German Catholics
have voted with exemplary docility every increase
of the army and navy. Only once did they dare
to propose a small reduction in the estimates for the
expenditure on the war against the Herreros. But
the indignation they raised by their independent
attitude, and the doubtful elections of 1907, taught
them a practical lesson in patriotic submission which
they are not likely soon to forget.

The Reichstag, therefore, is largely a debating
club, and its debates are as irresponsible as those of[35]
students in a University union, because no speech,
however eloquent, carries with it any of the responsibilities
of government. The Opposition in
England is careful of the language it uses, and more
careful of the promises it makes, because it knows
that it may be called upon to fulfil its promises and
to carry out the policy it advocates. In Germany
there is no such possibility. The Opposition is only
platonic. It is doomed to impotence.&#8221;


XIV.&mdash;The Servility of the German Universities
and of the Churches.

&#8220;It has often happened in other countries when the
expression of free opinions has become dangerous or
difficult that independent political thought has taken
refuge in the Universities. Even in Russia the
Universities have been a stronghold of Liberalism.
In the Germany of the first half of the nineteenth
century many a University professor suffered in the
cause of political liberty. In the Germany of to-day
the Universities are becoming the main support of
reaction. Professors, although they are nominated
by the faculties, are appointed by the Government;
and here again the Government only appoints &#8216;safe&#8217;
men. A scholar who has incurred the displeasure
of the political authorities must be content to remain
a Privatdozent all his life. The much-vaunted independence
of the German professors is a thing of the past.
They may be independent scientifically; they are not
independent politically. It is not that scholars have
not the abstract right to speak out, or that they would
be dismissed once they have been appointed; rather[36]
is it that they would not be appointed or promoted.
A young scholar with Radical leanings knows that
he will not be called to Berlin.

The German Universities still lead political thought;
they still wield political influence, and their influence
may be even greater to-day than it ever was, but that
influence is enlisted almost exclusively on the side
of reaction.

And what is true of the Universities is true of the
Churches. Of the Roman Catholic Church it is
hardly necessary to speak. Non ragionar di lor,
ma guarda e passa. The history of German Catholicism
proves once more that the Church is never more
admirable than when she is persecuted. During
the Kulturkampf the Catholics stood for political
liberty, whereas the so-called National Liberals
stood for State centralization and political despotism.
To-day, from being persecuted, the Catholic Church
has become a persecuting Church. She has entered
into an unholy compact with the Prussian Government.
She has ceased to be religious, and has
become clerical. She has ceased to be universal.
She has become narrowly Nationalist. She might
have played a glorious part in the new empire. Instead
she has resisted every attempt at financial
reform. She might have resisted the oppressive
policy against the Poles. Instead she has connived
at oppression. She might have opposed the orgies
of militarism. Instead she has voted every increase
in the army and navy. She has bartered her dignity
and spiritual independence to secure confessional
privileges, and to get her share in the spoils of office.

The Protestant Churches have not had the same[37]
power for evil, yet they have fallen even lower than
the Catholic Church. They have lost even more
completely every vestige of independence. German
University theologians may be advanced in higher
criticism, but they are opportunists in practical
politics. They are very daring when they examine
the Divine right of Christ, but they are very timid
when they examine the Divine right of the King and
Emperor. Protestantism produced one or two prominent
progressive leaders; but they have had to leave
their Churches. Dr. Naumann has become a layman;
St&ouml;cker, when he espoused the cause of the people,
was excommunicated, and the Kaiser hurled one of
his most violent speeches against his once favourite
Court chaplain.&#8221;


XV.&mdash;The Pan-German Plot.[8]

&#8220;For forty years Germany had been seeking an
outlet for her teeming population and her expanding
industries. Hitherto emigration had seemed to be a
sufficient outlet and a sufficient source of strength.
But as Germany was becoming more and more the
controlling power of the Continent, she refused to
be contented with sending out millions of her sons,
who, as mere emigrants to foreign countries, were
lost to the Vaterland.[9] How different would the power
of Germany have been, German Imperialists were
ever repeating, if the 20,000,000 Teutons who have
colonized the United States, or Brazil, or Argentina,
and have been absorbed and Americanized and
[38]Saxonized, had settled in territories under the Imperial
flag!

And thus Pan-Germanists have been looking
towards every part of the horizon. They have first
looked to the north and the north-west, and they have
reflected that the Rhine ought to belong to the Vaterland;
that Amsterdam, Rotterdam, and Antwerp
are the natural German harbours; that Denmark,
Holland, and Flemish Belgium are the outposts of
Germany for the transit commerce of Europe; and
that all these outposts ought to be included either
in an economic Zollverein or in a political confederation.[10]

But Germany wisely realized that those northern
ambitions would meet with absolute resistance on
the part of other Powers, that she was not yet strong
enough to defy that resistance, and that this fulfilment
of her aspirations must be postponed until
she was prepared to fight for the mastery of the sea.
In the meantime, she contented herself with peacefully
annexing the commerce of the Flemish and Dutch
ports, with building up a mercantile and a war navy,
with advocating the historical maritime philosophy
of Captain Mahan, and with repeating on every
occasion the famous note of warning: &#8216;Unsere
Zukunft ist auf dem Wasser.&#8217; Biding her time, and
following the line of least resistance, Germany for
the last twenty years therefore extended steadily
towards the south and towards the east. Towards
[39]the south she saw two decaying empires, Austria-Hungary
and Turkey, which seemed to be a natural
prey for her political and commercial ambitions:
two conglomerates of hostile races which are waiting
for a master. Towards the east she saw one of the
most ancient seats of human civilization, a huge
and rich territory, which is the one great country, in
close proximity to Europe, which is still left unoccupied
and undeveloped. On those three empires
Germany set her heart, and with the method and
determination which always characterize her she set
to work. And with an equally characteristic spirit
this gigantic scheme of commercial and political
absorption of three empires, from the Upper Danube
to the Persian Gulf, was being explained away and
justified by an all comprehensive watchword: the
Drang nach Osten. It was only in response to this
irresistible call and impulse, this Drang and pressure,
it was only to obey an historical mission, that the
Teuton was going to regenerate the crumbling empires
of Austria, of Turkey, and of Asia Minor.

In the first place, let us consider for one moment
the Austrian-Hungarian Empire. It is now fifty
years since, through the Battle of Sadowa, Austria-Hungary
was ousted from the German Confederation.
The same reasons which impelled Protestant Prussia
to drive Catholic Austria from the Germanic Confederation
are still in large measure subsisting to-day,
and I do not think that the Hohenzollern has any
intention of forcing the Habsburg into the Confederation
again, merely to obey the behests of the Pan-Germanists.
Prussia has no interest whatever in
reopening the ancient dualism of North and South, in[40]
re-establishing the two poles and antipodes, Berlin
and Vienna. As a matter of fact, ever since 1870
Austria-Hungary has been far more useful to German
aims in her present dependent condition than if she
were an integral part of the Confederation. In Continental
politics as well as in colonial politics, a disguised
protectorate may be infinitely preferable to
virtual annexation. The protectorate of Tunis has
given far less trouble to France than the colony of
Algeria. And for all practical interests and purposes,
Austria-Hungary has become a German dependency.
She has been drawn into the orbit of the Triple
Alliance. She follows the political fortunes of the
predominant partner. She almost forms part of the
German Zollverein, in that her tariffs are systematically
favourable to her northern neighbour. But above all,
Austria-Hungary renders to Germany the inestimable
service both of &#8216;civilizing&#8217;&mdash;that is, of &#8216;Germanizing&#8217;&mdash;the
inferior races, the Slavs, and of keeping
them in check. It is a very disagreeable and difficult
task, which Germany infinitely prefers to leave to Austria
rather than to assume herself. And it is a task for
which, as Professor Lamprecht, the national historian,
is compelled to admit, the Austrian German seems far
more qualified than the Prussian German. And
Germany can thus entirely devote herself to her
world ambitions, whilst Austria is entirely absorbed
by her racial conflict&mdash;for the King of Prussia!

For the last twenty-five years the process of
Germanizing has been going on without interruption.
A bitter war of races and languages is being waged
between the Austrian German and the Magyar,
between the Teuton and the Slav. Of the Slav[41]
the Austrian Teuton wants to make his political
slave. To him &#8216;Slav&#8217; and &#8216;slave&#8217; are synonymous
words; and when we consider that the Slavs are
disunited in language and religion, and that they hate
each other almost as cordially as they hate the
Niemets; and when we further consider that behind
the ten millions of Austrian Germans there will be
sixty-five millions of other Germans to support them,
whilst the Catholic Tcheches and Poles can only fall
back on the support of abhorred and heretical
Russia, there is every reason to fear that the Slav
must eventually come under the economic and political
control of the Austrian Germans&mdash;that is to say,
ultimately under the influence of the German Empire.

But it is not only the Slavs of the Austrian Empire
that are threatened by German absorption; that
absorption has rapidly extended to the Slav States of
the Balkan Peninsula. On the south as well as on
the north of the Danube, Austria has been used as
the &#8216;cat&#8217;s-paw,&#8217; or, to use the more dignified expression
of Emperor William, as the &#8216;loyal Sekundant&#8217;
of the Hohenzollern. The occupation of Bosnia-Herzegovina,
in defiance of the Treaty of Berlin,
was the beginning of that Austrian Drang nach Osten
policy, the next object of which is the possession of
the Gulf of Salonica, and the ultimate object of which
is the control of Constantinople.&#8221;


XVI.&mdash;Germany controlling Turkey.[11]

&#8220;The absorption of Turkey is not a distant dream:
it is very nearly an accomplished fact. Twenty-five
years ago Germany declared she had no political
[42]stake in the affairs of Turkey. As recently as the
&#8217;seventies, Bismarck proclaimed in the Reichstag that
the Eastern Question was not worth the loss of one
Pomeranian soldier.

To-day Germany is wellnigh supreme on the
Bosphorus. She started by sending military instructors,
amongst whom was the famous General
Von der Goltz Pasha, and by reorganizing the Turkish
Army on the German model. She then sent her
travellers, absorbing the commerce of the country.
She then sent her engineers, obtaining concessions,
building railways, and practically obtaining the
control of the so-called &#8216;Oriental&#8217; line. Finally,
she became the self-appointed doctor of the &#8216;sick
man.&#8217; Whenever the illness of recent years came
to a crisis&mdash;after the Armenian and the Macedonian
atrocities, after the Cretan insurrection&mdash;Germany
stepped in and paralyzed the action of Europe. It
was Germany that not only enabled Turkey to crush
Greece and to restore her military prestige: it was
Germany that enabled her to reap the fruits of
victory.

For ten years Lohengrin appeared as the temporal
providence, the protector of Abdul Hamid. The
Holy Roman Emperor appeared as the saviour of the
Commander of the Faithful. A Power which did
not have one Mohammedan subject claimed to
protect two hundred million Mohammedans. And
when, in 1897, Emperor William went on his memorable
pilgrimage to Jerusalem, this latter-day pilgrim
entered into a solemn compact with a Sovereign still
reeking from the blood of 200,000 Christians. The
Cross made an unholy alliance with the Crescent.[43]

This alliance, coinciding with the journey to
Jerusalem, marked a further step in the forward
movement, in the Drang nach Osten policy. It was
the third and the last stage, and by far the most
important one. It was obvious that, on the European
side of the Bosphorus, Germany could not make
much further progress for some years to come. The
times were not ripe. International jealousies might
be prematurely roused, all the more so because
neither the German Kaiser nor his subjects have the
discretion and modesty of success. But on the
Asiatic side there extended a vast Asiatic inheritance,
to which, as yet, there was no European claimant;
to which already, forty years ago, German patriots
like Moltke, German economists like Roscher and
List, had drawn the attention of the Vaterland&mdash;a
country with a healthy climate and with infinite
resources as yet undeveloped. This was to be in
the immediate future the field of German colonization.
On his way to Jerusalem the German Emperor
pressed once more his devoted friend the Sultan for
an extension of German enterprise in Asia Minor.
The concession of the railway to Baghdad was
granted, and a new and marvellous horizon opened
before the Hohenzollern.&#8221;


XVII.&mdash;German Socialism making for Reaction
and War.

&#8220;And not only is German Socialism not as strong,
neither is it as pacifist as is generally supposed. Outsiders
take it for granted that in the event of a conflict
between France and Germany there would be[44]
solidarity between the French and the German
artisans. They assume that Socialism is essentially
international. And in theory such an assumption
is quite legitimate. But many things in Germany
are national which elsewhere are universal. And
in Germany Socialism is becoming national, as German
political economy is national, as German science is
national, as German religion is national. Therefore
the political axiom that German Socialists would
necessarily come to an understanding with their
French and English brethren has been falsified by
the event. German Socialists have, no doubt, shown
their pacific intentions; they have issued pacific
manifestoes and organized pacific processions; they
have filed off in their hundreds of thousands in the
streets of Berlin to protest against the war party;
but when the question of peace or war has been
brought to a point in Socialist congresses&mdash;when
their foreign brethren have moved that in the case
of an unjust aggression the German Social Democrats
should declare a military strike&mdash;German Socialists
have refused to assent. The dramatic oratorical
duel which took place between the French and the
German delegates at the Congress of Stuttgart illustrates
the differences between the national temperament
of the Frenchman and the German. When
called upon to proclaim the military strike, the
German Socialists gave as an excuse that such a
decision would frighten away from the Social Democrat
party hundreds of thousands of middle-class
supporters. This excuse is an additional proof of
the moral and political weakness of Social Democracy.
It illustrates its moral weakness; for the Socialist[45]
leaders sacrifice a great principle for the sake of an
electoral gain. The leaders know that nationalist
feeling runs high in the middle classes; they know
that any anti-militarist policy would be unpopular.
And they have not the courage as a party to face
unpopularity. And the arguments used at Stuttgart
also illustrate the political weakness of German
Socialism; for they show that the Socialist vote does
not possess the cohesion and homogeneity with which
it is credited: they show that hundreds of thousands
of citizens who record a Socialist vote are not Socialists
at all. To vote for Socialism is merely an indirect
way of voting against the Government. There is no
organized Opposition in Germany. The Socialists
are the only party who are &#8220;agin the Government.&#8221;
And all those German citizens who are dissatisfied
with conditions as they are choose this indirect and
clumsy method of voting for the Socialists in order
to express their dissatisfaction with the present
Prussian despotism.

It is therefore not true to say that Socialism in
Germany is a decisive force working for peace. It
would be more true to say that it is a force working
for war, simply because it is a force working for reaction.
Prussian reaction would not be so strong
if it were not for the bugbear of Social Democracy.
If Social Democracy attracts a considerable section
of the lower middle class, it repels and frightens the
bulk of the middle classes as well as of the upper
classes. Many Liberals who would otherwise oppose
the Government support it from horror of the red
flag, and they strengthen unwillingly the power of
reaction. And therefore it would scarcely be a[46]
paradox to say that the nearer the approach of the
Socialistic reign, the greater would be the danger to
international peace. German contemporary history
illustrates once more a general law of history, that
the dread of a civil war is often a direct cause of a
foreign war, and that the ruling classes are driven to
seek outside a diversion from internal difficulties.
Thus political unrest ushered in the wars of the Revolution
and the Empire; thus the internal difficulties
of Napoleon III. brought about the Franco-German
War; thus the internal upheaval of Russia in our
days produced the Russo-Japanese War.

It may be true that power is slipping away from
the hands of the Prussian Junkerthum and the bureaucracy,
although Prussian reaction is far stronger than
most foreign critics realize. But whether it be
strong or weak, one thing is certain: a power which
has been supreme for two centuries will not surrender
without a struggle. The Prussian Junkers may be
politically stupid, but they have not lost the fighting
spirit, and they will not give way to the &#8216;mob.&#8217;
Before Prussian reaction capitulates, it will play its
last card and seek salvation in a European conflagration.&#8221;


XVIII.&mdash;Is the Kaiser making for Peace or
for War?

&#8220;Is the tremendous power and popularity of the
Kaiser exercised in the direction of peace or in the
direction of war?

To an Englishman the Kaiser&#8217;s devotion to military
pursuits, his frequent brandishing of the sword, his[47]
aggressive policy of naval expansion, seem to be in
flagrant contradiction with his no less persistent
protests both of his sympathy for England and of his
love for peace. We are reminded that Napoleon III.
also delighted to express his love for peace&mdash;&#8220;L&#8217;Empire
c&#8217;est la paix&#8221;&mdash;yet he brought about the most
disastrous war in French history. We are reminded
that Nicholas II. of Russia also started his reign as
the peacemaker of Europe, the initiator of the
Conference of The Hague, yet he brought about the
most bloody war in Russian history. Are the Kaiser&#8217;s
pacific protests as futile, are his sympathies as hollow,
as those of a Napoleon or a Nicholas?

Unfortunately, if the Kaiser&#8217;s protests of peace are
supported by many of his utterances and sanctioned
by the interests of his dynasty, they are contradicted
not only by many other utterances, but, what is
more serious, they are contradicted by his personal
methods, and, above all, by the whole trend of his
general policy.

Very few observers have pointed out one special
reason why the personal methods of the Kaiser will
prove in the end dangerous to peace&mdash;namely, that
they have tended to paralyze or destroy the methods
of diplomacy.

Little as we may like the personnel of legations
and embassies, strongly as we disapprove of the
methods by which they are recruited, urgent as is
the reform of the Foreign Office, it remains no less
true that the function of diplomacy is more vital
to-day than it ever was in the past. For it is of the
very purpose and raison d&#8217;&ecirc;tre of diplomacy to be
conciliatory and pacific. Its object is to achieve by[48]
persuasion and negotiation what otherwise must be
left to the arbitrament of war. It is a commonplace
on the part of Radicals to protest against the practices
of occult diplomacy. In so far as that protest is
directed against the spirit which animates the members
of the diplomatic service, it is fully justified. But in
so far as it is directed against the principle of secret
negotiation, the protest is absurd. For it is of the
very essence of diplomacy that it shall be secret, that
it shall be left to experts, that it shall be removed
from the heated atmosphere of popular assemblies,
and that it shall substitute an appeal to intellect and
reason for the appeal to popular emotion and popular
prejudice.

For that reason it is deeply to be regretted that
the personal interferences of the Kaiser have taken
German diplomacy out of the hands of negotiators
professionally interested in a peaceful solution of
international difficulties, and have indirectly brought
diplomacy under the influence of the German
&#8216;patriot&#8217; and the jingo. An Ambassador need not
depend on outside approval; his work is done in
quiet and solitude. The Kaiser, on the contrary,
conducts his foreign policy in the glaring limelight
of publicity; and whenever he has been criticized
by experts, his vanity has only too often been tempted
to appeal to popular passion and to gain popular
applause. For that reason, and entirely apart from
his indiscretions, the bare fact that the Kaiser has
become his own Foreign Secretary has lessened the
chances of peace.

Nor has the whole trend of his domestic policy
been less injurious to the cause of peace. In vain[49]
does the Kaiser assure us of his pacific intentions:
a ruler cannot with impunity glorify for ever the
wars of the past, spend most of the resources of his
people on the preparations for the wars of the future,
encourage the warlike spirit, make the duel compulsory
on officers and the Mensur honourable to
students, place his chief trust in his Junkers, who
live and move and have their being in the game of
war, foster the aggressive spirit in the nation, and
hold out ambitions which can only be fulfilled by an
appeal to arms: a ruler cannot for ever continue to
saw the dragon&#8217;s teeth and only reap harvests of
yellow grain and golden grapes.&#8221;


XIX.&mdash;Belgium the Achilles Heel of the
British Empire.

&#8220;Personally I am inclined to think that the fear of
a German invasion has haunted far too exclusively
the imagination of the English people, and has
diverted their attention from another danger far more
real and far more immediate. With characteristic
na&iuml;vet&eacute; and insular selfishness, some jingoes imagine
that if only the naval armaments of Germany could
be stopped, all danger to England would be averted.
But surely the greatest danger to England is not the
invasion of England: it is the invasion of France and
Belgium. For in the case of an invasion of England,
even the Germans admit that the probabilities of
success would all be against Germany; whilst in the
case of an invasion of France, the Germans claim
that the probabilities are all in their favour. It is[50]
therefore in France and Belgium that the vulnerable
point lies, the Achilles heel of the British
Empire.&#8221;


XX.&mdash;The Neutrality of Belgium will be
violated.

&#8220;It is true that in theory the neutrality of Belgium
is guaranteed by international treaties; but when I
observe the signs of the times, the ambitions of the
German rulers, and when I consider such indications
as the recent extension of strategic railways on the
Belgian-German frontiers, I do not look forward
with any feeling of security to future contingencies
in the event of a European war. I am not at all
convinced that the scare of a German invasion of
England is justified. Indeed, I am inclined to
believe the Germans when they assert that in case of
war Germany would not be likely to invade Britain.
She would be far more likely to invade Belgium,
because Belgium has always been the pawn in the
great game of European politics, and has often been,
and may again become, the battlefield and cockpit
of Europe.&#8221;


XXI.&mdash;The Coming War will be a Political and
Religious Crusade.

&#8220;If a war between the two countries did break out,
it would not be merely an economic war, like the
colonial wars between France and England in the
eighteenth century; rather would it partake of the
nature of a political and religious crusade, like the[51]
French wars of the Revolution and the Empire.
The present conflict between England and Germany is
the old conflict between Liberalism and despotism,
between industrialism and militarism, between progress
and reaction, between the masses and the classes. The
conflict between England and Germany is a conflict,
on the one hand, between a nation which believes in
political liberty and national autonomy, where the
Press is free and where the rulers are responsible to
public opinion, and, on the other hand, a nation where
public opinion is still muzzled or powerless and where
the masses are still under the heel of an absolute
government, a reactionary party, a military Junkerthum,
and a despotic bureaucracy.

The root of the evil lies in the fact that in Germany
the war spirit and the war caste still prevail, and that
a military Power like Prussia is the predominant
partner in the German Confederation. The mischievous
masterpiece of Carlyle on Frederick the
Great, and his more mischievous letter to The Times,
have misled English opinion as to the true character
and traditions and aims of the Prussian monarchy.
Prussia has been pre-eminently for two hundred
years the military and reactionary State of Central
Europe, much more so even than Russia. Prussia
owes whatever she is, and whatever territory she has,
to a systematic policy of cunning and deceit, of
violence and conquest. No doubt she has achieved
an admirable work of organization at home, and has
fulfilled what was perhaps a necessary historic
mission, but in her international relations she has
been mainly a predatory Power. She has stolen her
Eastern provinces from Poland. She is largely[52]
responsible for the murder of a great civilized nation.
She has wrested Silesia from Austria. She has taken
Hanover from its legitimate rulers. She has taken
Schleswig-Holstein from Denmark, Alsace-Lorraine
from France. And to-day the military caste in
Prussia trust and hope that a final conflict with
England will consummate what previous wars have
so successfully accomplished in the past. They are
all the more anxious to enter the lists and to run the
hazards of war because it becomes more and more
difficult to govern a divided Reichstag and a dissatisfied
people without uniting them against a
foreign enemy, and because they realize that unless
they restore their prestige and consolidate their
power by a signal victory the days of their predominance
are numbered.&#8221;


XXII.&mdash;The Nature of the Coming War.

&#8220;The war of to-morrow, therefore, will not be like
the war of 1870, a war confined to two belligerent
forces: it will be a universal European war. Nor
will it be a humane war, subject to the rules of international
law and to the decrees of the Hague Tribunal:
it will be an inexorable war; or, to use the
expression of von Bernhardi, it will be &#8216;a war to the
knife.&#8217; Nor will it be decided in a few weeks, like
the war of 1870: it will involve a long and difficult
campaign, or rather a succession of campaigns; it
will mean to either side political annihilation or
supremacy.&#8221;

CHAPTER III[53]

THE CURSE OF THE HOHENZOLLERN


I.&mdash;Royalties made in Germany.

It has become a trite and hackneyed claim of the
Prussian megalomaniacs that they are an Imperial
people, a super-race predestined by Nature and
Providence to the domination of the world. It
certainly seems a grotesque claim to assert on the
part of a people who in their political and social
life have shown themselves a pre-eminently servile
people; who have ever been cringing to their superiors;
who never produced one single leader of free men,
one Cromwell, one Mirabeau, one Gambetta; who
always believed in the virtue of passive obedience;
who always submitted to the policeman rather than
to a policy; who always obeyed a Prince rather than
a principle; who, as recently as the end of the
eighteenth century, allowed themselves to be sold
like cattle by Hessian princelings; who never rose to
defend their sacred rights; who never fought a spirited
battle in a righteous civil war; and who have always
been ready to fight like slaves at the bidding of a
sword-rattling despot.

And yet in one very important respect the Germans
may rightly claim that they are actually ruling the[54]
European world. German Princes are actually
seated on almost every throne of Europe. The
French language may still be the language of diplomacy,
but the German language, which was still
a despised lingo to Frederick the Great, has become
the language of European royalties. Germany for
two hundred years has done a most thriving and most
lucrative export trade in princelings. One Hohenzollern
Prince ruling in Roumania for thirty years
asserted German influence in that Latin country.
Another Hohenzollern Prince ruling in Athens, nicknamed
&#8220;Tino&#8221; by his affectionate relative the
Kaiser, for three years stultified the will of his people,
who were determined to join the cause of the Allies.
Still another German Prince ruling in Sofia, who
five years ago was mainly responsible for the horrors
of the second Balkan War, compelled the Bulgarian
nation to betray the cause of Russia, to whom the
Bulgarian people owe their political existence and
liberation from the yoke of the Turk.

Even yet public opinion does not realize to what
an extent European Princes in the past have been
made in Germany. We speak of the Royal House of
Denmark as a Danish House. The Danish House
is in real fact the German dynasty of Oldenburg.
We speak of the House of Romanov as a Russian
dynasty. And it is true that the founder of the
dynasty, Michael Romanov, the son of Philarete,
Archbishop of Moscow and Patriarch of all the
Russias, was a typical Muscovite, and was called to
the throne in 1611, in troubled times, by the unanimous
voice of the people. But, as all the Czars of
Russia for two hundred years only married German[55]
Princesses, without one single exception, the Russian
dynasty had become in fact a German dynasty.
So far as mere heredity is concerned, Nicholas II.,
through the German marriages of all his ancestors,
is of German stock to the extent of sixty-three sixty-fourths,
and of Russian stock only in the proportion
of one sixty-fourth.


II.&mdash;The Significance of the Hohenzollern
Dynasty.

Of all the German dynasties seated on the thrones
of Europe, the Hohenzollern stand out, not merely
as the most powerful, but also by far the most striking
and the most interesting. The Hohenzollern are as
unique in the history of royalty as the Rothschilds
are unique in the history of finance. The history of
other dynasties has been largely a history of Court
scandal and intrigue, providing inexhaustible material
to the petty gossip of Court chroniclers. We are all
familiar with the amorous episodes of Louis XIV.
and Louis XV., with the mysteries of the Grand and
Petit Trianon and of the Parc aux Cerfs, with Madame
de Maintenon and Madame de Montespan, with Madame
de Pompadour and Madame du Barry, that beautiful
courtesan who on the scaffold so pathetically asked
the executioner: &#8220;Mr. Hangman, I beseech you, do
spare me.&#8221; We are all familiar through Thackeray&#8217;s
&#8220;History of the Georges&#8221; with the chronique scandaleuse
of the Hanoverian dynasty. No doubt the
Hohenzollern also have had their chronique scandaleuse
and have also attracted the prurient curiosity
of memoir writers. The Court of Berlin in the days[56]
of the polygamist King, Frederick William II., the
successor of Old Fritz, was the most dissolute Court
of Europe, as Berlin is to-day the most depraved city
on the Continent. But somehow the scandals of the
Hohenzollern seem to be irrelevant episodes. Somehow
we do not think of the annals of the august
House as a history of scandal. We only think of the
Hohenzollern as the political necromancers of modern
Europe, as the supreme masters of statecraft. The
very name of the Hohenzollern recalls to our minds
a race of State-builders. Machiavelli selected the
House of Borgia to illustrate the principles of the
statecraft of the Renaissance. A modern Machiavelli
would have to go to Potsdam to study the philosophy
of high politics.

From the beginning the Hohenzollern have been
identified with the Prussian State. Louis XIV. said
of himself, &#8220;L&#8217;&eacute;tat c&#8217;est moi,&#8221; but Louis XIV. was
an exception in modern French history. On the
contrary, every Hohenzollern could have applied to
himself the words of the Bourbon King.

If we take each individual Hohenzollern, we find
the most obvious differences between them. No
dynasty more strikingly illustrates that psychological
and political peculiarity of royal houses,
which may be called the law of opposites, and which
has almost the regularity of a universal law according
to which each ruler is the living contrast of his
predecessor. The successor of the Great Elector,
Frederick I. (1688-1713), the first King of Prussia,
was an extravagant fop who spent a year&#8217;s income on
the ceremony of coronation. On the contrary, his
successor, &#8220;Fat William&#8221; (1713-1740), the Sergeant-King,[57]
was a miser, who on his coronation only spent
2,227 thalers and ninepence, where his father had
squandered over six millions, a maniac who collected
tall grenadiers as other Kings have collected pictures,
who tortured his children, and who wanted to punish
with a death sentence a juvenile escapade of the heir
to the throne. Frederick the Great (1740-1786),
again, was the antithesis of Frederick William I.,
and loved literature and art as intensely as his father
detested them. Frederick William II. (1786-1797),
the successor of the great realist and woman-hater,
was a polygamist and a mystic. Frederick William
III. (1797-1840) was an exemplary husband and a
well-meaning, business-like bourgeois. He was succeeded
by Frederick William IV. (1840-1861), a
romanticist and a dreamer who ended in madness.
William I. (1861-1888) was an honest, straightforward,
methodical, reasonable, self-controlled
soldier. Frederick III. was an idealist, and, like
Frederick the Great, a lover of literature and art.
William II. has bewildered the world as a versatile
and omniscient dilettante, war-lord and peacemaker,
Mohammedan and Christian&mdash;always a
comedian, yet always in earnest. And we all know
how the heir to the throne is the reverse of the
Kaiser, and how this Crown Prince, with the fancies
of a degenerate, has deserved to be called the &#8220;Clown
Prince.&#8221;

It is therefore apparent that if we analyze the
characteristics of every one of the nine dynasts who
have reigned in Prussia since the Great Elector for
the last two hundred and fifty years, we do not find
one single ruler who resembles his predecessor or his[58]
successor. Yet all these Hohenzollerns, whether
capable or incapable, whether mad, half-mad, or
sane, whether profligate or domesticated, whether
extravagant or miserly, have certain common traits.
They have all been inspired with the same dynastic
policy. When we consider the individual variations
from the family type, there can be here no question
of physical heredity, like the lip of the Habsburg or
the tainted blood of the Spanish Bourbons. It is
a question of political environment, a question of
dynastic tradition. Indeed, we must carefully study
that Hohenzollern family tradition of politics if we
want to grasp the full significance of the word, if we
wish to understand how such a dynastic tradition
may become a formidable power to European history.
Maeterlinck in his &#8220;Life of the Bee&#8221; has an eloquent
and profound chapter on the &#8220;Spirit of the Hive.&#8221;
In the domestic and international policy of the
Prussian State, in the Hohenzollern dynastic tradition,
we discover such a collective spirit, the &#8220;Spirit
of the Prussian Hive,&#8221; the evil spirit of war mania
and megalomania, the treachery, the brutality, the
greed, and, above all, the predatory instinct dignified
into the name of Real Politik. And Europe will
only enjoy permanent peace and security if she
succeeds in destroying that Hohenzollern tradition,
that sinister spirit which lives in the wasps&#8217; and
hornets&#8217; nest of Berlin, that spirit which has &#8220;Potsdamized&#8221;
Europe, and which has debased the moral
currency of European politics.[59]


III.&mdash;Landmarks in Hohenzollern History.

No one would call the political history of Germany
an interesting history. It is only the history of free
nations or the free play of spiritual forces that is of
abiding human interest, and the history of Germany
is neither the history of a free people nor the conflict
of spiritual forces. That history is so intolerably
tedious that even the magic of Treitschke&#8217;s genius
has not been able to relieve its dulness, and that
before the war no British or French publisher dared
venture on a translation of Treitschke&#8217;s masterpiece.
But if the political history of Germany has all
the tedium and monotony of parochialism, on the
contrary, the personal history of the Hohenzollern
is intensely instructive. One would hesitate to call
it romantic. Yet there is an element of romance,
the romance of business, the interest which attaches
to the rise of a family from the humble obscurity
of a petty princeling to the power and prestige of
world rulers, the same kind of interest which belongs
to the life-story of Mr. Vanderbilt or Mr. Carnegie.
What a progress those Hohenzollerns have made
from the distant days when they left their little
Swabian southern home of Zollern between the
Neckar and the Upper Danube, the cradle of their
dynasty! Nomen, omen! Does not the very sound
of the word Hohenzollern suggest and inspire high
ambitions? And does not the very name of that
little village of Zollern, which is apparently derived
from Zoll, suggest that all the world was henceforth
to pay a Zoll, or toll, to the dynasts of Hohenzollern?[60]

And what a strange succession of incidents! In
themselves those incidents may seem insignificant.
They left little trace in the chronicles of olden times.
Yet those petty incidents have proved decisive events
in the annals of modern humanity. We see those
events happening from generation to generation
without any apparent connection. Yet somehow they
all made for the aggrandizement of the family. We
see successive Princes acquiring through marriage
and inheritance possessions in scattered and remote
outposts of the Holy Roman Empire. Yet somehow
all those outposts became eventually milestones
on the highway to greatness. One ancestor becomes
Burgrave of Nuremberg&mdash;a considerable promotion!
A subsequent Burgrave of Nuremberg lends money
to a needy Austrian Emperor, and becomes in 1417
Elector of Brandenburg&mdash;a much more considerable
promotion! Again, another ancestor inherits at the
other extremity of Germany the petty dukedom of
Cleves, and that dukedom became the nucleus of
Prussian power in the Far West of Germany. Still
another ancestor of a collateral branch becomes
Grand Master of the religious Order of the Teutonic
Knights, and this fact induces Master Martin Luther,
who was much more of a realist and a time-server
and a trimmer than theologians give him credit
for, to advise the Hohenzollern Grand Master to
secularize his knights, to confiscate the whole Church
property of the Order, and to make himself the
overlord of Eastern Prussia.

Thus everything has worked for the aggrandizement
of the future Kings of Prussia, everything has
brought grist to the mill of Sans-Souci.[61]


IV.&mdash;A Dynasty of Upstarts.

No dynasts in modern times, not even the Bourbons
nor the Habsburgs, have been more obsessed with the
pride of race. A double avenue of gaudy statues in
Berlin has been erected in the Siegesallee, or Alley of
Victory, to illustrate the glories of the House. And
Carlyle, in his &#8220;History of Frederick the Great,&#8221;
devotes a whole volume&mdash;and a very tedious volume&mdash;to
the medieval ancestors of the dynasty. The
present Kaiser believes himself to be the lineal
successor, not only of the Hohenstaufen, but of
the C&aelig;sars of Ancient Rome. It was in that
spirit that he was graciously pleased recently to
dedicate a monument to his predecessor, Emperor
Trajan! Trajano Romanorum Imperatori, Wilhelmus
Imperator Germanorum! (To Trajan, Emperor
of the Romans, William, Emperor of the
Germans!)

But all that Hohenstaufen-Hohenzollern genealogy
is mythical history. The real history of the Hohenzollern
is of recent date, and begins in 1640 with the
advent of the Great Elector (1640-1688). Compared
with the ancient House of Habsburg or of Bourbon,
the Hohenzollern may well be called the &#8220;parvenus&#8221;
of royalty. Until the seventeenth century the
Electors of Brandenburg were twice vassals&mdash;lieges
of the Holy Roman Empire and vassals of the Kings
of Poland; and when in 1701 the first Hohenzollern
King promoted himself to royal rank and ascended
the throne, he made ceaseless and humiliating
attempts to secure recognition. The old Houses[62]
refused to accept his title, and would not acknowledge
the upstart royal &#8220;brother.&#8221;

But the very fact that the Hohenzollern are the
&#8220;parvenus&#8221; of European royalty has spurred them
on to more strenuous endeavours and to still higher
ambitions. Their sole endeavour was to raise their
position: sich considerable machen, as the Great
Elector said in his quaint pidgin German. They
were not born to the royal dignity. They had to
make it. They were not accepted as Kings. They
had to assert themselves and to impose their claims.
The good sword of Frederick the Great asserted his
claims with such results that, except Napoleon, no
ruler ever since has disputed the right of the Hohenzollern
to rank amongst the dynasts of Europe.


V.&mdash;Prussia as an Upstart State.

Even as the Hohenzollern are an upstart dynasty,
so the Prussian State may be called an upstart State.
It has not, like France, Great Britain, or Spain, two
thousand years of history behind it. Until the end
of the Middle Ages Christian civilization was bounded
by the Elbe. The Prussian populations were the
last in Europe to be converted to Christianity, and
recent history has proved only too conclusively
that the conversion never struck deep roots.
Until the end of the Middle Ages the religious and
military Order of the Teutonic Knights had to wage
war against the Prussian heathen, and the magnificent
ruin of Marienburg, the stately seat of the Teutonic
Knights, still testifies to the achievements of the
Order. Marienburg is the only historic city of[63]
Prussia; Berlin is but a mushroom growth of modern
days. Whilst London and Paris go back to the
beginning of European history, Berlin only three
hundred years ago was a mean village inhabited by
Wendish savages.

It cannot be sufficiently emphasized that Prussia
is not a nation, but a State, and that State is an
entirely artificial creation. France and Great Britain
are the slow and natural growths of many centuries.
They have definite geographical boundaries, their
people have common traditions, common ideals,
common affinities. The Prussian State is made up
of a heterogeneous mosaic of provinces, the spoils
of successive invasions. What hold together the
artificial fabric of the Prussian State are only the
dynasty, the bureaucracy, and the Army. The
bureaucracy and the Army are to Prussia what the
Civil Service and the British Army are to the Indian
Empire. Suppress the British Army and the Civil
Service, and British rule ceases to exist. Suppress
the Hohenzollern dynasty, the Prussian bureaucracy,
and the Junker Army, and the Prussian structure
crumbles to pieces.

Nature has been niggardly to Prussia. Everything
has had to be made with the hands of man.
Brandenburg, Pomerania, Western and Eastern
Prussia are dreary wastes; Berlin is an oasis of brick
and stone amidst a Sahara of sand. The provinces of
old Prussia have few industrial resources. The very
soil had to be made by intensive agricultural methods.
The very population had to be imported. Modern
Prussia is neither the gift of Nature nor the outcome
of history. It is the triumph of human statecraft.[64]
It is the achievement of the &#8220;will to power.&#8221; When
that &#8220;will to power&#8221; relaxes the Prussian State
collapses.


VI.&mdash;The Prussian State is not a German
State.

The modern Holy German Empire is born of the
unholy nuptials of the German people with the Prussian
State. But the paradox is that the Prussian
State, which claims the right to rule the German
States, who themselves assert their right to rule over
Europe, cannot even pretend to be German. The
contrast between the German and the Prussian has
often been pointed out.

The Southern and Western German is still to-day,
as he was in the days of Madame de Sta&euml;l, artistic
and poetic, brilliant and imaginative&mdash;a lover of song
and music. The Prussian remains as he has always
been, inartistic, dull, and unromantic. Prussia has
not produced one of the great composers who are
the pride of the German race; and Berlin, with all
its wealth and its two million inhabitants, strikes the
foreigner as one of the most commonplace capitals of
the civilized world. The Southern and Western
German is gay and genial, courteous and expansive;
the Prussian is sullen, reserved, and aggressive. The
Southern and Western German is sentimental and
generous; the Prussian is sour and dour, and only
believes in hard fact. The Southern and Western
German is an idealist; the Prussian is a realist and
a materialist, a stern rationalist, who always keeps his
eye on the main chance. The Southern and Western[65]
German is independent almost to the verge of
anarchism; he has a strong individuality; his patriotism
is municipal and parochial; he is attached to
his little city, to its peculiarities and local customs;
the Prussian is imitative, docile, and disciplined;
his patriotism is not the sentimental love of the
native city, but the abstract loyalty to the State.
The Southern and Western German is proud of his
romantic history, of his ancient culture; the Prussian
has no culture to be proud of.

That contrast of temperament between Prussians
and Germans corresponds to a difference of race. The
Prussians are not really Teutons. They are alien
intruders. The Prussians, the Pruzi or Pruteni,
are Lithuanians. The population of Brandenburg is
Slav. Berlin, Brandenburg, or Brannybor, are Slav-Wendish
names. The ruler of the Grand Duchy of
Mecklenburg, a State which is even more Prussian
than Prussia, and which is a strange survival of
feudalism, bears until this day the name of &#8220;Prince
of the Wendes.&#8221;

Century after century the Burgraves of Brandenburg
and Kings of Prussia had to attract colonists
to their dreary dominions. The recruiting sergeant
went out all over Europe to fill the ranks of the
Prussian Army. One-third of Frederick the Great&#8217;s
Army was made up of foreigners. Frederick the
Great on his accession found himself at war with the
Prince-Bishop of Li&eacute;ge, because that worthy prelate
would not allow his subjects to be impressed by the
Prussian press-gang. Prussian colonizing agents
scoured the neighbouring countries for agricultural
labourers, foresters, and artisans. Twenty thousand[66]
Bohemians were imported by the Sergeant-King. In
the eighteenth century by far the most important
element introduced into Prussia was of French
origin. The majority of the French Huguenots of
the lower classes were attracted to Prussia. The
population of Berlin, which was only 6,000, was
doubled by the French exodus. The very language
spoken at Berlin was a savoury mixture of French
and German. Ein plus machen meant in the language
of the Grand Elector to have a surplus revenue.
To express his ideal of kingship, the Elector said:
Ich stabilire die souverainet&eacute; auf einen rocher von
Bronce. Dem Regiment obligat expressed the obligation
of military service. At the accession of Frederick
the Great, out of a population of 2,400,000, 600,000
were refugees. It is one of the most impressive
instances of historical retribution that modern Prussia
should thus have been built up with the assistance
of French exiles, and that modern France should have
been crushed by the descendants of the French
Protestants who were expelled by the bigotry of
Louis XIV.

The colonization of Prussia has proceeded until this
day. Before the war immigration into Germany was
exceeding the emigration. Polish labour continues
to migrate to the Eastern provinces. Hence the
odious expropriations of Polish land in the district
of Posen. The ablest literary and industrial and
political talent from all parts of Germany has been
attracted for generations to the Prussian capital.
Prussian jingoes claim for Prussia the credit of
every administrative improvement, of every political
achievement of modern Germany. As a matter of[67]
fact, the Prussian State has achieved little by itself.
Its originality is never to initiate, but skilfully to
exploit the creations of others. It is a safe rule to
assume that every statesman or leader who has made
an original contribution to Prussian history is not
of Prussian origin. The greatest philosopher of
Prussia, Kant, was a Scotsman. Her greatest statesman,
Stein, was a Westphalian. Of the two greatest
Prussian Generals, one, Bl&uuml;cher, was a Mecklenburger;
the other, Moltke, was a Dane. The national
historian of Prussia, Treitschke, is a Saxon of
Bohemian descent.


VII.&mdash;Prussia as a Military State.

That colony of many heterogeneous populations
is above all a military State, a Kriegstaat. It was
created through war and has been organized for war.
In the eighteenth century the whole of Prussia was
one vast camp and barracks. The King of Prussia
is primarily the Kriegsherr, or war-lord. The ruling
caste of Junkers is a caste of warriors. The very
schoolmasters in the eighteenth century were nearly all
recruited from the invalided non-commissioned officers.
Historians single out Fat William, the Sergeant-King,
as the supreme type of the martinet King.
But it is not only Fat William, but all the Kings
of Prussia who have been martinet Kings and recruiting
sergeants. Prussia has made war into an
exact science. Prussia has created the &#8220;nation in
arms.&#8221;

Geographical conditions and the ambitions of the
Hohenzollern have combined to make war a permanent[68]
necessity. Prussia was a &#8220;mark&#8221; or frontier
land, and the margraves or mark-grafs were the earls
and protectors of the Mark. The frontiers of Prussia
were open on every side. She was surrounded by
enemies. George William, the father of the Great
Elector, during the Thirty Years&#8217; War tried to maintain
neutrality. He soon found out that neutrality
did not pay, and his territory was overrun by hostile
bands. Pomerania was occupied and retained by the
Swedes. Poles, Russians, and Austrians in turn invaded
the country. After the Battle of Kunersdorff,
in 1761, Prussia was at her last gasp, and Frederick
the Great found himself in so desperate a position that
he had resolved on committing suicide. Again, after
Jena, Berlin was occupied by the French, and for five
years remained under the yoke. Insecurity has been
for generations the law of Prussian existence. The
Prussian State has known many ups and downs and
has passed through many tragic vicissitudes. They
managed to turn geographical and military necessities
to the advantage of their dynastic ambitions.
What was at first commanded by the instinct of self-preservation
became afterwards a habit, a tradition,
and a systematic policy. They discovered that the
best way to maintain an efficient defensive was to
transform it into a vigorous offensive. They discovered
that the best means of living safely was to
live dangerously. They discovered, in the words of
Treitschke, that &#8220;the one mortal sin for a State was
to be weak.&#8221;


VIII.&mdash;Prussia as a Predatory State.[69]

Not only is Prussia a military State, it is also a
predatory State. All the great Powers of Europe
have been in a sense military States. But to them
all war has only been a means to an end, and often a
means to higher and unselfish ends. The Spaniards
were a military nation, but their wars were crusades
against the Moor. The Russians have been a military
nation, but their wars were crusades against the Turk
or wars for the liberation of the Serbians, the Bulgarians,
and the Greeks. The French have been a
military nation, but they fought for a chivalrous
ideal, for adventure, for humanity. Even Napoleon&#8217;s
wars of conquest were really wars for the establishment
of democracy. The Corsican was the champion and
the testamentary executor of the French Revolution.

The peculiarity of the Prussian State is that it has
been from the beginning a predatory State. The
Hohenzollerns have ever waged war mainly for
spoliation and booty. Not once have they waged
war for an ideal or for a principle.

The German Kaiser delights to appear in the garb
of the medieval knight. He wears three hundred
appropriate uniforms. A German wit has said that
he wears the uniform of an English Admiral when he
visits an aquarium, and that he dons the uniform of
an English Field-Marshal when he eats an English
plum-pudding. Amongst those three hundred disguises
there is none which is more popular in
Germany than that of the Modern Lohengrin bestriding
the world in glittering armour. The Kaiser[70]
lacks the democratic gift of humour, and does not
seem to be aware of the incongruity of the Lohengrin
masquerade. A Prussian King cannot honestly play
the part of a knight in quest of the Holy Grail.
Chivalry and Prussianism, the crusading spirit and
the predatory spirit, are contradictory terms.

The most exalted Order of the Prussian dynast is
the Order of the Black Eagle. The Hohenzollerns
could not have chosen a more fitting emblem than
that of the sinister bird of prey. For they have been
pre-eminently the men of prey amongst modern
dynasts. Every province of their dominions has
been stolen from their neighbours. They secularized
and stole the Church property of the Teutonic
Order. They stole Silesia from Austria. They acquired
Posen by murdering a noble nation. They
stole Hanover from its lawful rulers. They stole
Schleswig-Holstein from the Danes. They wrested
Alsace-Lorraine from the French.

Circumstances in modern times seem to have
singularly favoured their designs of conquest. To
outward appearance they were threatened by powerful
enemies, but those enemies looked far more formidable
than they appeared. On the Far Western
boundary, the feeble ecclesiastical Princes of Cologne,
Treves, and Mayence ruled over the smiling fields
and vineyards of the Rhine provinces. On every
side Germany was broken up into petty principalities.
The Holy Roman Empire of Germany, which was
neither Holy nor Roman nor German, and which
had ceased to be an empire, was only the shadow of
a great name. Austria was perpetually distracted
by internal and external dangers. Poland was an[71]
unruly republic. The very weakness of their neighbours
was a temptation to the Hohenzollern.

The one redoubtable enemy to the Hohenzollern
dynasty was Russia. But after the disastrous defeat
of the Seven Years&#8217; War inflicted by Russian arms,
Prussia learned to control by deceit and policy a
Power which she dared not challenge, and could
not hope to overcome, on the battlefield. From the
middle of the eighteenth century Prussia concluded
a dynastic alliance with the Russian dynasty. The
Hohenzollerns liberally provided their Russian
brethren with German Princes and Princesses. The
Prince of Holstein, who became Tsar Peter III., was
the first German Prince of the Romanov dynasty.
The little Cinderella Princess of Anhalt-Zerbst, the
future Catherine the Great, was the first of an uninterrupted
line of German Princesses. The Teutonic
barons of the Baltic provinces for one hundred and
fifty years were able to control the Russian foreign
policy. Nesselrode for forty years was the Foreign
Minister of the Tsar, although he only spoke German
and did not know a word of Russian. Nicholas I. and
Alexander II., with unswerving loyalty, supported
the interests of their Prussian brother-in-law and
nephew.

On two occasions the Russian Tsars actually saved
the Hohenzollern from complete destruction. In
1761, when Russian armies occupied Berlin, an
apologetic Tsar begged to be forgiven for daring to
vanquish his illustrious cousin. In 1807, at Tilsit,
Prussia was only saved from dismemberment through
the quixotic intervention of Tsar Alexander I. And
the Russian Tsar proved so powerless against Prussian[72]
intrigues that, although Alexander I. had concluded
a close alliance with Napoleon, the German-Russian
Court at St. Petersburg boycotted Napoleon&#8217;s Ambassador,
Savary, and eventually succeeded in
breaking the Franco-Russian coalition.

But the Hohenzollerns did not only wage a predatory
war for conquest and spoliation. Their
methods have been as predatory as their aims. War
to them was not merely a policy. It was a business,
and often a lucrative business. In the Middle Ages
war had been largely a trade. A huge commerce in
prisoners was transacted, and an enterprising Italian
Condottiere would often recoup himself through the
ransom of one single rich prisoner. The Prussians
have continued those medieval methods until this
day. Treitschke lays it down in his &#8220;Politik&#8221; that
war must be made to pay, and need not exhaust a
Prussian Treasury.

The poor Belgians to-day are learning to their cost
the full meaning of those Prussian predatory methods.
The Prussian invaders are extorting millions of
money, as well as enormous food-supplies, from a
starving people. They are dislocating whatever
remains of the internal trade. They are breaking up
thousands of miles of Belgian railways, and they are
sending them to the Polish theatre of war. But,
brutally as the poor Belgians have been treated, one
shudders to think of the cruelty and the greed of the
Prussian in the new conquered Russian territories,
and of the pitiful plight of the Poles and the
Lithuanians.[73]


IX.&mdash;Prussia as a Feudal State.

Prussia in her fiscal and commercial policy may be
called a typical modern State. The Hohenzollerns
have been compelled to utilize all the resources of
commerce and industry, not because they are liberal
or progressive, but merely in order to increase the
national revenue, in order to provide for an ever-swelling
military expenditure. On the contrary, in
her political constitution Prussia has remained a
medieval and feudal State. She is the Paradise of
the Junker. But Prussian Junkerthum is not merely
a squirearchy of independent landowners. Mr.
Bernard Shaw, in his &#8220;Common Sense about the
War,&#8221; in which one ounce of common sense is mixed
with three ounces of nonsense, would make us believe
that there is little difference between German Junkerthum
and British Junkerthum, and that there is little
to choose between the English Junker, Sir Edward
Grey, and a Pomeranian squire. Mr. Shaw must
have studied Prussian conditions to very little
purpose when he makes so ludicrous a comparison.
To call such a quiet, silent country gentleman, such
a law-abiding Parliamentarian as Sir Edward Grey,
to call even him a typical Prussian Junker is a
travesty of the facts. A more striking contrast to
the complete Junker of Pomerania than the &#8220;Complete
Angler&#8221; of the Foreign Office could not well
be imagined. The glorified Prussian Junker is Bismarck.
The typical Junker is Prince Bl&uuml;cher. A
perfect modern type is that fiery Freiherr von Oldenburg,
who advised the Kaiser to send a troop of[74]
Uhlans, as in the old Cromwellian days, to clear out
the politicians of a disloyal Reichstag.

The Prussian Junkers are the lieges of the war-lord.
They are all the more loyal to the throne as they are
poor, and therefore dependent on the King for their
very subsistence. There are few large estates in
Prussia, and they yield but a meagre revenue. The
relations of the Junkers to the Hohenzollerns are the
relations of William the Conqueror to his companions-in-arms.
The Junkers originally held their broad
acres, their Rittergut, by military tenure. Some of their
feudal privileges have gone, but they continue to be
the leading political power in the State under the
Kaiser&#8217;s Majesty. They are the pillars of the throne.
They owe military service. To recall the words of the
Sergeant-King, they are &#8220;dem Regiment obligat.&#8221;
And they are rewarded for their military services by
privileges innumerable. They are the controlling
influence in the Landtag, which is a representative
assembly only in name. They occupy the higher
posts in the Civil Service and in the Diplomatic
Service. In each district the Landrat is the supreme
authority, the electioneering agent of the Government
and the representative of the Prussian King.

And the Junker caste have been as selfish, as
rapacious, as their Hohenzollern overlords. Nothing
could be more sordid than their attitude in the recent
campaign for financial reform. They have shifted
the burden of taxation upon the weaker shoulders
of the peasant and artisan. They have compelled
von B&uuml;low to reverse the Liberal Free Trade policy
of Caprivi, and to impose heavy corn duties, merely
to increase their own rents.[75]


X.&mdash;Prussia as a Despotic State.

In a military State like Prussia, which is mainly
organized for war, where war is the vital function,
not only does the King hold his power by the Divine
right of the sword, but even in times of peace all
political power is concentrated into his hands:
&#8220;L&#8217;&eacute;tat c&#8217;est moi!&#8221;

In such a State a Parliamentary Government is
an absurdity, and, as a matter of fact, there is no
Parliamentary Government, neither in Prussia nor
in the Empire. There is no responsible Cabinet.
The Chancellor is accountable, not to the majority
of the Reichstag, but to the Kaiser. The Germans
imagine that because they have the fiction of universal
suffrage they possess the most democratic Government
in Europe. And an enthusiastic German
triumphantly reminded me of the fact at a mass meeting
which I recently held in San Francisco on behalf
of the Allies. I reminded him that Bismarck himself
has given us in his &#8220;Memoirs&#8221; the Machiavellic
reasons which induced him to invent the fiction of
universal suffrage. The man of blood and iron tells
us that he only adopted universal suffrage as a
temporary device to convert the German States to
the Prussian policy, and as a means of influencing
the people against the federal dynasties.

The Reichstag is essentially different from a
British House of Commons. As a political body it
is the most contemptible assembly in Europe. It
is a mere debating club, a convenient machine to
vote the Government taxes. And even the power of[76]
voting has been largely taken from it. It has become
part of the German constitutional practice that
the military estimates must be passed without discussion.
It is only considerable increases of the army
and navy which have to be submitted to the Reichstag,
and those increases are generally voted for a number
of years. In 1887 a characteristic episode happened.
Bismarck had decided on formidable additions to
the army, and he wanted those additions voted and
guaranteed for seven years. The military &#8220;Septennate
Law&#8221; frightened even a docile Reichstag, and
the Catholic party refused to vote it. Bismarck,
who for ten years had fought the Pope, and who had
thundered against the interference of a foreign
ecclesiastical potentate in temporal matters, now
asked the Pope to interfere in favour of the Army
Bill. To the discredit of the Papacy, Leo XIII.
fell into the trap. Leo XIII. exerted pressure on
the Catholic party. But they still were recalcitrant.
Bismarck and the Pope proved equally persistent.
Finally, at the behest of the Iron Chancellor and with
the assistance of the Vicar of Christ, the Reichstag
passed that fatal military law, which was the beginning
of the colossal European armaments, which were to
increase the political tension of Europe until breaking-point,
and which was to result in the present catastrophe.
Thus is Parliamentary Government carried
on in the Empire of the Hohenzollern!

Passive obedience and discipline are the cardinal
virtues inculcated by the Hohenzollern. &#8220;Verboten,&#8221;
&#8220;Nicht raisonniren,&#8221; are their watchwords.
A Hohenzollern brooks no opposition. &#8220;Wir bleiben
doch der Herr und Koenig und thun was wir wollen,[77]&#8221;
said the Sergeant-King. And two hundred years
after, the Kaiser expresses the same imperial sentiments:
&#8220;Wer mir nicht gehorcht, den zerschmettere
ich&#8221; (Whoever refuses to obey, I shall smash).
Bismarck, who created the German Empire, was dismissed
like a lackey. Baron von Stein, who reformed
the Prussian State, and who stands out as the greatest
statesman of his age, was ignominiously dismissed.
Ingratitude has always formed part of the Hohenzollern
code of royal ethics.

We are told by the apologists of the Hohenzollern
that the same discipline, the same obedience to duty,
are practised by the rulers themselves. &#8220;Ich Dien&#8221;
is the Hohenzollern motto. Of all the servants of
the Prussian State, there is none who serves it more
loyally, more strenuously, than the King of Prussia.
&#8220;I am the Commander-in-Chief and the Minister of
Finance of the King of Prussia,&#8221; said the Sergeant-King
of himself. How often have the Prussian Kings
been held up as shining examples of devotion to
duty! Behold how hard a Hohenzollern King has
to work for the State! In the same way the business
man who rules his staff with a rod of iron might say
to his discontented workmen: &#8220;See how strenuously
I labour for the success of the business!&#8221; The
workmen would probably answer that the ceaseless
toil of the business man is not wholly disinterested,
that the millionaire manufacturer is not a philanthropist;
and the apologists of the Hohenzollern
might be reminded that a King of Prussia in every
generation has been wont to work mainly for himself.[78]


XI.&mdash;The Hohenzollern as the Champions
of Protestantism.

Treitschke urges as one of the chief claims of the
Hohenzollerns that they have been in modern
Europe the champions of the Protestant religion
and at the same time the apostles of toleration. Is
not the Kaiser the supreme head of his Church and
the Anointed of the Lord? Does not he still preach
edifying sermons to his soldiers and sailors? And
does he not at the same time extend his Imperial
protection over believers of every creed?

The truth is that the Hohenzollerns have never
been the champions of Protestantism, but have astutely
and consistently exploited it for their own
purposes. They did espouse the Lutheran and
Calvinistic faith, but their conversion enabled them
to appropriate the vast dominions of the Church,
a spoliation which might have presented some difficulties
if they had remained Catholic. We saw that,
during the Thirty Years&#8217; War, during the supreme
crisis of Protestantism, William George, Elector of
Brandenburg, remained neutral and allowed the
Northern hero, Gustavus Adolphus, and Cardinal
Richelieu to champion the cause of the Protestant
religion.

Not only did the Hohenzollerns not defend the
Protestant religion; they perverted it and debased
it by subjecting it to the Prussian State. Such
subjection is the negation of Protestantism, as it is
the negation of Christianity. Christianity in a
political sense has always meant the separation of[79]
the spiritual and the temporal powers. It is the
essence of Anglo-Saxon Protestantism that it actually
does protest. It is of the essence of Nonconformity
that it refuses to conform. Prussian Protestantism
has ceased to protest, and conforms to whatever is
demanded by the State. The Lutheran parson is
the obedient servant of the Hohenzollern. &#8220;Cujus
regio illius religio&#8221;: spiritual allegiance must follow
temporal allegiance.

The ultimate outcome of the confusion of spiritual
and temporal powers in Prussia has been that Prussia
has become the Atheist State, and it is because the
Prussian State is an Atheist State and absolutely
indifferent to the interests of religion that it has come
to practise in its own peculiar way the political
virtue of toleration. As the Prussian wars of conquest
had brought together many heterogeneous
populations professing different religions, toleration
became a vital necessity for the State. It is not a
virtue of the dynasty, and the Hohenzollerns certainly
deserve no credit for it. The Prussian doctrine of
toleration has always been of a negative and conditional
kind. Prussian Kings have adopted the
religious theory of Gibbon. All religions are equally
true to the believer. They are equally true to
the unbeliever. They are equally useful to the
State.

All religions have proved equally useful and have
been exploited with equal indifference by the Prussian
dynasty. The attitude of Frederick the Great to
religion is characteristic of the Hohenzollern attitude.
Frederick the Great was surrounded by a band of
French, Swiss, and Scottish Atheists. His main[80]
relaxation from the cares of State was to bandy
cynical and obscene jests on Christianity with the
Table Round at the private supper-parties of Potsdam.
But his royal hatred and contempt for all positive
religion did not prevent him from cordially inviting
the Jesuits to his dominions because he found them
useful pedagogues to teach and conciliate his newly
conquered Polish subjects. It is one of the paradoxes
of history that the same religious order which had been
suppressed by the Pope and expelled by the Catholic
Kings of France and Spain was protected by the
Atheist King of Prussia and the Atheist Empress
of Russia. According to the same opportunist
Hohenzollern tradition, Bismarck in turn fought the
Pope, imprisoned Bishops and Cardinals, and then
used the influence of the Pope and the hierarchy to
further his Machiavellian policy. Even so in more
recent times the Kaiser appeared at one and the
same time as a devout pilgrim to the Holy Land, as
the special friend of Abdul Hamid&mdash;Abdul the
Damned&mdash;and as the self-appointed protector of
three hundred million Mohammedans.


XII.&mdash;How the German People were
subjected to Prussia.

We have analyzed the principles which ever
directed the Prussian State. We have described the
characteristics of the Hohenzollern dynasty who
created that Prussian State. How is it that the
German nation should have surrendered their destinies
to a power which is so constitutionally selfish, so
inherently evil, which has trampled down all the[81]
principles that a modern world holds dear and
sacred?

The subjection of Germany to Prussia has been a
triumph of Hohenzollern diplomacy and deceit, and
has been the outcome of a tragic misunderstanding
on the part of a politically uneducated and inexperienced
people. The German people were tired of their
political impotence, of their miserable dynastic
quarrels, of their abject subservience to their parasitic
princelings. The German people, broken up in a
hundred petty States, had the legitimate and praiseworthy
ambition of becoming a united people.
German unity had been for generations a cherished
dream of German patriots. History had abundantly
proved that the Austrian Empire could not assist in
the realization of that dream. Then came the opportunity
of the Prussian tempter. Prussia offered her
mighty sword. Prussia alone had the military
power and a strong political organization. The
German States yielded to the temptation. They
trusted that, in concluding an alliance with Prussia,
they would retain their liberties. Indeed, they
hoped that once German unity was realized, Germany
would assimilate and absorb the Prussian State.
Alas! it was the Hohenzollern State which was to
annex and subject the German Empire. Little did
the Germans know Prussian tenacity. Little did
they know the rapacity of the Black Eagle. Still
less did they know the black magic of the necromancer
Bismarck.

Treitschke reminds us in his &#8220;Politik&#8221; of an
incident which is characteristic of the relation of the
German Empire to Prussia. On one occasion even[82]
Bismarck, the Prussian Junker, expressed a misgiving
that a particular law would not be acceptable to the
Federal States of the Empire. Emperor William
contemptibly dismissed the objection. &#8220;Why should
the Federal States object when they are only the
prolongation of Prussia?&#8221; Treitschke, the Saxon,
accepts the Prussian theory of Emperor William.
He tells us proudly that the Federal States have ceased
to be independent States&mdash;indeed, that they have
lost the essential characteristics of a State, that they
are only called States by courtesy, that there is only
one State in the German Empire, and that all the
other Federal communities only continue their precarious
existence by virtue and with the consent of
the Hohenzollern dynasty.

It is one of the most appalling misunderstandings of
history. Like Faust, the German people have sold
their soul to Mephistopheles: Bismarck. And they
have sold it for power. They are now paying the
price. As in the wonderful old ballad of Burger,
the Prussian horseman has taken the maiden &#8220;Germania&#8221;
on his saddle. The death&#8217;s-head hussar has
carried her away on his wild career through space
until he has brought her to the gates of Hell.

It has thus been the fate of the German nation, as
of other European nations, to work and fight for the
aggrandizement of the King of Prussia. A section
of the people, the Social Democrats and the Liberals,
have made fitful and impotent efforts to free themselves
from the tyranny of the Hohenzollern. What
they have not succeeded in doing, Europe is now
doing for them. In the fulness of time, Europe has
arisen to crush the Hohenzollern, to kill the &#8220;Spirit[83]
of the Prussian Hive.&#8221; The war will result in the
enfranchisement of Germany as it will result in the
enfranchisement of Poland and Serbia. Did the
history of the world ever present so tragic a paradox?
Twelve million heroes are fighting the German
Government. Millions of the manhood of the civilized
world are laying down their lives on all the battlefields
of Europe and all the high seas of the world,
mainly in order to make the German people free.


XIII.&mdash;Judgment on the Hohenzollern State.

In 1807, after the crushing defeat inflicted by
Napoleon on the Prussian armies at Jena, when the
Military Monarchy crumbled to pieces in one day like
a house of cards, Joseph de Maistre, the most profound
and the most prophetic political thinker of
his age, wrote the following significant lines from
St. Petersburg. To realize the full significance of the
judgment, one must remember that Count de Maistre
was a fanatic supporter of the old monarchic order.
He hated Napoleon with a bitter hatred, but he hated
Prussia more:

&#8220;Ever since I have started to reason, I have felt
a special aversion for Frederick II., whom a frenzied
generation has been in a hurry to proclaim a great
man, but who was really no more than a great Prussian.
Posterity will consider this Prince as one of the
greatest enemies of the human species that has ever
lived. His monarchy, which had inherited his
spirit, had become an argument against Providence.
To-day that argument has been converted into a
tangible proof of eternal justice. This famous[84]
structure built with blood and mud, with debased
coin and base libels, has crumbled in the twinkle
of an eye.&#8221;[12]

Those words were written exactly one hundred
and ten years ago, and the world is once more
anxiously looking forward to another Jena which
will deal a final blow to the Hohenzollern monarchy.
When that catastrophe comes, Europe, enlightened
by the awful experiences of the last hundred years,
and delivered from the black magic of the political
necromancers of Potsdam, will unanimously echo
the prophetic judgment pronounced by Joseph de
Maistre. For to-day, even more than in 1807,
Prussia has become an &#8220;argument against Providence.&#8221;
Even more than in 1807 the Prussia of
1917 &#8220;is built with blood and mud.&#8221; Even more
than in 1807 the chastisement of Prussia is demanded
by &#8220;eternal justice.&#8221; The whole civilized world
will breathe more freely when the sinister and diabolical
power will be broken for ever and will oppress
and degrade humanity no more.

CHAPTER IV[85]

THE GERMAN WAR-TRIUMVIRATE


I.&mdash;NIETZSCHE.

The English reader is now in possession of a complete
translation of Nietzsche, in the admirable
edition published by T.&nbsp;N. Foulis, and edited by
Oscar Levy, of which the eighteenth and concluding
volume has just appeared. To the uninitiated I
would recommend as an introductory study: (1)
Professor Lichtenberger&#8217;s volume; (2) Ludovici,
&#8220;Nietzsche&#8221; (1s., Constable), with a suggestive preface
by Dr. Levy; (3) the very useful summary of Mr.
M&uuml;gge&mdash;an excellent number in an excellent series
(Messrs. Jack&#8217;s &#8220;People&#8217;s Books&#8221;); (4) Dr. Barry&#8217;s
chapter in the &#8220;Heralds of Revolt,&#8221; giving the
Catholic point of view; (5) Mrs. F&ouml;rster-Nietzsche,
&#8220;The Young Nietzsche&#8221;; and (6) an essay by the
present writer, published as far back as 1897, and
which, therefore, may at least claim the distinction
of having been one of the first to draw attention in
Great Britain to the great German writer. But a
searching estimate of Nietzsche in English still remains
to be written. And there is only one man that could
write it, and that man is Mr. Gilbert K. Chesterton.
I confidently prophesy that a study of Nietzsche, if[86]
he has the courage to undertake it, will be Mr. Chesterton&#8217;s
greatest book. He will find in the German
heretic a foe worthy of his steel.


I.

Like the history of most great thinkers, like the
history of Kant and Schopenhauer, the biography
of Nietzsche is totally barren of incident, and can be
disposed of in a few lines. Born in 1844, apparently
of noble Polish extraction (&#8220;Nizky&#8221; in Polish means
humble), the son of a clergyman, and the descendant
on both sides of a long line of clergymen, the future
&#8220;Anti-Christ&#8221; spent an exemplary, studious, and
strenuous youth. After serving his time in the army&mdash;he
was considered one of the best riders of his regiment&mdash;and
after a brilliant University career at Bonn
and Leipzig, he was appointed, at twenty-four years
of age, Professor of Greek in the University of Bale.
His academic activity extended over eleven years, and
was only interrupted in 1870 by a few months&#8217; service
in the Ambulance Corps, during the Franco-German
War.

His first book, &#8220;The Birth of Tragedy,&#8221; appeared
in 1871. Like most of his books, it was published at
his own expense, and, like most of his books, it did
not find a public. The three first parts of his masterpiece,
&#8220;Thus Spake Zarathustra,&#8221; were such a
desperate failure that Nietzsche only ventured to
print fifty copies of the fourth and concluding part,
and he printed them merely for private circulation
amongst his friends, but he only disposed of seven
copies![87]

In 1879 he resigned, owing to ill-health, with a
pension of &pound;120. After his retirement he spent a
nomadic life wandering from Nice to Venice, and
from the Engadine to Sicily, ever in quest of health
and sunshine, racked by neuralgia and insomnia, still
preaching in the desert, still plunging deeper and
deeper into solitude. And as the world refused to
listen to him, Nietzsche became more and more convinced
of the value of his message. His last book,
&#8220;Ecce Homo,&#8221; an autobiography, contains all the
premonitory symptoms of the threatening tragedy.
It is mainly composed of such headings as the following:
&#8220;Why I am so Wise,&#8221; &#8220;Why I am so Clever,&#8221;
&#8220;Why I write such Excellent Books,&#8221; and &#8220;Why I
am a Fatalist.&#8221;

Alas! fatality was soon to shatter the wise and
clever man who wrote those excellent books. In
1889 Nietzsche went mad. For eleven years he
lingered on in private institutions and in the house
of his old mother at Naumburg. He died in 1900,
when his name and fame had radiated over the civilized
world, and when the young generation in Germany
was hailing him as the herald of a new age. England,
as usually happens in the case of Continental thinkers,
was the last European country to feel his influence;
but in recent years that influence has been rapidly
gaining ground, even in England, a fact abundantly
proved by the great and startling success of the
complete edition of his works.[88]


II.

Most writers on Nietzsche&mdash;and they are legion&mdash;begin
with extolling him as a prophet or abusing him
as a lunatic. I submit that before we extol or abuse,
our first duty is to understand. And we can no longer
evade that duty. We cannot afford any longer to
ignore or dismiss the most powerful force in Continental
literature, on the vain pretence that the
author was mad, as if the greatest French thinker of
the eighteenth century, Rousseau, and the greatest
thinker of the nineteenth century, Auguste Comte,
had not fallen victims to the same disease.

And, on the whole, Nietzsche is not difficult to
understand, although there has arisen a host of commentators
to obscure his meaning, although Nietzsche
himself delights in expressing himself in the form of
cryptic and mystic aphorism, although he continuously
contradicts himself. But apart from those
difficulties, his message is strikingly simple and his
personality is singularly transparent. And his message
and his personality are one. He is a convincing
illustration of Fichte&#8217;s dictum, that any great system
of philosophy is the outcome, not of the intellect, but
of a man&#8217;s character. Nietzsche is not a metaphysician
like Hegel, whom he abhorred. He is not
a &#8220;logic-grinder,&#8221; like Mill, whom he despised. He
is a moralist, like the French, whom he loved. His
culture and learning were French even more than
German. He was steeped in Montaigne, to whom he
has paid a glowing tribute in &#8220;Schopenhauer as
Educationalist.&#8221; He was a careful student of the[89]
great French classics of the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries. He read and annotated Guyau, with whom
he had many points in common. By a curious
coincidence, a few years before the advent of Nietzsche,
a great French thinker had anticipated every
one of Nietzsche&#8217;s doctrines, and had expressed them
in one of the most striking books of the French
language. And by an even more curious paradox,
whilst every European critic devotes himself to-day
to the interpretation of Nietzsche&#8217;s philosophy, they
systematically ignore&mdash;as Nietzsche himself ignored&mdash;the
masterpiece of the Frenchman.


III.

Let us, then, first keep in mind that Nietzsche is not
a metaphysician or a logician, but he is pre-eminently
a moralist. His one aim is to revise our moral
values and to establish new values in their place.
For Nietzsche does both. There are two poles to his
thought. He is an iconoclast, but he is also a hero-worshipper.
He is a herald of revolt, but he is also
a constructive thinker. Even in his earliest work,
&#8220;Thoughts out of Season,&#8221; whilst he destroys the
two popular idols of the day, the theologian and the
historian, he sets up two new heroes, Schopenhauer
and Wagner.


IV.

We have said that Nietzsche&#8217;s philosophy is
strikingly simple. Its whole kernel can be expressed
in two words. He is a systematic pagan, and he is
an uncompromising aristocrat. As a pagan, he is a[90]
consistent enemy of Christianity. As an aristocrat,
he is a bitter opponent of democracy. He proclaims
that Anti-Christ has appeared in his own person.
He hails the advent of the Superman.

First, he is a pagan, a pagan of Greece, or, rather,
a pagan of the Renascence, and, as a pagan, he
considers Christianity the real enemy. Christianity
denies life; Nietzsche asserts it. Christianity mainly
thinks of the future world; Nietzsche has his feet
firmly planted on Mother Earth. Christianity glorifies
meekness and humility; Nietzsche glorifies pride and
self-assertion. Christianity defends the poor and
the weak; Nietzsche contends that the strong alone
have a right to live. Christianity blesses the peacemakers;
Nietzsche extols the warriors. Christianity
is the religion of human suffering; Nietzsche is a
worshipper of life, and proclaims the joyful science,
die fr&ouml;hliche Wissenschaft, the gaya scienza.

It is impossible within the limits of a short article
to discuss Nietzsche&#8217;s view of Christianity. We are
concerned here not with discussion, but with exposition.
At an early opportunity we hope to deal at
some length in the columns of Everyman with Nietzsche&#8217;s
criticism of Christianity. For the present,
let it be sufficient to say that no theologian would be
prepared to accept his interpretation of the Christian
religion. The everlasting conflict of spirit against
sense and brutal force, which is the essence of
Christianity, is hardly conducive to passivity. It is,
on the contrary, a consistent discipline in modern
heroism. There is not much meekness about the
Jesuits or the warrior Popes. Nor is there much
melancholy about St. Francis of Assisi or St. Theresa.[91]
The only smiling countenance in a hospital is the
Sister of Mercy. The only active resisters under
the despotism of Henry VIII. were Sir Thomas More
and a broken octogenarian priest, Cardinal Fisher.


V.

The same fundamental instinct or principle, the
same defiant optimism, the same exultation in the
pride of life, which makes Nietzsche into an opponent
of Christianity, also makes him into an opponent of
democracy. The same belief in force, in the will to
power, which makes Nietzsche into a pagan, also
makes him into an aristocrat. For the political
expression of Christianity must needs be democracy.
We are democrats because we are Christians, because
we believe in the essential dignity of man. On the
contrary, the political outcome of paganism must
needs be despotism and aristocracy. We believe in
despotism and aristocracy because we believe in the
natural inequality of man, because we believe in force
and pride and self-assertion, in the power of the
strong to oppress the weak. Nietzsche is against
the oppressed and for the oppressor; for the Superman
against humanity. For in Nietzsche&#8217;s view an
aristocracy is the ultimate purpose of life.

But Nietzsche is not an aristocrat, like the ordinary
Darwinian. He does not believe in the survival of
the fittest, like the typical evolutionist. He does
not believe that a survival of the fittest will come
about mechanically by the mere play of blind forces.
Regression is as natural as progression. No one has
pointed this out more convincingly than Huxley in[92]
his &#8220;Evolution and Ethics.&#8221; The progress of the
race is not natural, but artificial and accidental and
precarious. Therefore Nietzsche believes in artificial
selection. The Superman is not born, he must be
bred. Nietzsche is the spiritual father and forerunner
of the Eugenists.

And he is also the spiritual father of the Imperialists
and latter-day Militarists. The gospel of the inequality
of the individual implies the gospel of the
inequality of race. The gospel of Nietzsche has not
only been anticipated by Mr. Joseph Chamberlain,
but by his much more influential German namesake,
Mr. Houston Stewart Chamberlain, the author whose
books the Kaiser liberally distributed amongst his
Generals and advisers. The doctrine of force, the
belief in the German people as the salt of the earth,
the self-gratification of the modern Teuton, can be
traced directly to the influence of Zarathustra, and
it is significant that the latest German exponent of
Imperialism, General von Bernhardi, should have
selected an aphorism of Nietzsche as the quintessence
of his political philosophy:

&#8220;War and courage have achieved more great things
than the love of our neighbour. It is not your
sympathy, but your bravery, which has hitherto
saved the shipwrecked of existence.

&#8220;&#8216;What is good?&#8217; you ask. &#8216;To be braced is
good.&#8217;&#8221;[13]
[93]

VI.

Quite apart from any elements of truth contained
in Nietzsche&#8217;s ethics, the first reason for his popularity
is, no doubt, the perfection of his form and
style. Nietzsche is one of the supreme masters of
language, in a literature which counts very few
masters of language, and the beauty of his style
is transparent even in the disguise of a foreign
translation.

The second reason is that Nietzsche, who imagined
that he was fighting against the times, was in reality
thinking with the times, and he has met with a ready
response, in the dominant instincts of the present age,
in the aggressive materialism, in the race for wealth
and power. The Supermen and the Super-races of
to-day only too cordially accept a philosophy which
seems to justify extortion, aggression, and oppression
in the name of a supreme moral principle.

The third and most important reason, and the real
secret of Nietzsche&#8217;s influence, is the fine quality of
his moral personality. However much we may be
repelled by the thinker, we are attracted by the
magnetism of the man, by his noble courage, by his
splendid integrity, by his love of truth, his hatred of
cant. Even though he has himself misunderstood
Christianity, he has done a great deal to bring us
back to the fundamental ideals of the Christian
religion. He has done a great deal to undermine that
superficial and &#8220;rose-water&#8221; view of Christianity
current in official and academic Protestant circles.
He has done a great deal to convince us that whatever[94]
may be the essence of Christianity, it has nothing in
common with that silly and pedantic game which,
for half a century, has made Eternal Religion depend
on the conclusions of &#8220;Higher Criticism,&#8221; and which
has made theology and philosophy the handmaidens
of arch&aelig;ology and philology.

Nietzsche is a formidable foe of Christianity, but
he is a magnanimous foe, who certainly brings us
nearer to a comprehension of the inmost meaning
of the very doctrines he attacks. And it is quite
possible that the Christian champion of the future
may incorporate Nietzsche in his apologetics, even
as St. Thomas Aquinas incorporated Aristotle, even
as Pascal incorporated Montaigne. It was in the
fitness of things that Nietzsche should be the descendant
of a long line of Protestant ministers. For,
indeed, he is the last of the true German Protestants,
ever ready to protest and to defy and to challenge.
He is the noblest of modern German heretics.


II.&mdash;MONTAIGNE AND NIETZSCHE.

I.

There is a continuity and heredity in the transmission
of ideas as there is in the transmission of life.
Each great thinker has a spiritual posterity, which
for centuries perpetuates his doctrine and his moral
personality. And there is no keener intellectual
enjoyment than to trace back to their original progenitors
one of those mighty and original systems
which are the milestones in the history of human
thought.[95]

It is with such a spiritual transmission that I am
concerned in the present paper. I would like to
establish the intimate connection which exists between
Montaigne and Nietzsche, between the greatest
of French moralists and the greatest of Germans. A
vast literature has grown up in recent years round the
personality and works of Nietzsche, which would
already fill a moderately sized library. It is therefore
strange that no critic should have emphasized
and explained the close filiation between him and
Montaigne. It is all the more strange because
Nietzsche himself has acknowledged his debt to the
&#8220;Essays&#8221; with a frankness which leaves no room to
doubt.

To anyone who knows how careful Nietzsche was
to safeguard his originality, such an acknowledgment
is in itself sufficient proof of the immense power which
Montaigne wielded over Nietzsche at a decisive and
critical period of his intellectual development. But
only a systematic comparison could show that we
have to do here with something more than a mental
stimulus and a quickening of ideas, that Montaigne&#8217;s
&#8220;Essays&#8221; have provided the foundations of Nietzsche&#8217;s
philosophy, and that the Frenchman may
rightly be called, and in a very definite sense, the
&#8220;spiritual father&#8221; of the German.


II.

At first sight this statement must appear paradoxical,
and a first reading of the two writers reveals
their differences rather than their resemblances. The
one strikes us as essentially the sane; the other, even[96]
in his first books, reveals that lack of mental balance
which was to terminate in insanity. The one is a
genial sceptic; the other is a fanatic dogmatist. To
Montaigne life is a comedy; to his disciple life is a
tragedy. The one philosophizes with a smile; the
other, to use his own expression, philosophizes with a
hammer. The one is a Conservative; the other is a
herald of revolt. The one is constitutionally moderate
and temperate; the other is nearly always extreme
and violent in his judgment. The one is a practical
man of the world; the other is a poet and a dreamer
and a mystic. The one is quaintly pedantic, and his
page is often a mosaic of quotations; the other is
supremely original. The one is profuse in his professions
of loyalty to the Roman Catholic Church;
the other calls himself Anti-Christ.


III.

There can be no doubt that if the characteristics
which we have just referred to belonged essentially
to Montaigne, there would be little affinity between
the thought of Nietzsche and that of Montaigne.
And it would be impossible to account for the magnetic
attraction which drew Nietzsche to the study of the
&#8220;Essays,&#8221; and for the enthusiasm with which they
inspired him. But I am convinced that those characteristics
are not the essential characteristics. I am
convinced that there is another Montaigne who has
nothing in common with the Montaigne of convention
and tradition. I am convinced that the scepticism,
the Conservatism, the irony, the moderation, the
affectation of humility, frivolity, pedantry, and[97]
innocent candour, are only a mask and disguise which
Montaigne has put on to conceal his identity, that
they are only so many tricks and dodges to lead the
temporal and spiritual powers off the track, and to
reassure them as to his orthodoxy. I am convinced
that beneath and beyond the Montaigne of convention
and tradition there is another much bigger and
much deeper Montaigne, whose identity would have
staggered his contemporaries, and would have landed
him in prison. And it is this unconventional and real
Montaigne who is the spiritual father of Nietzsche.

It is obviously impossible, within the limits of a
brief paper, to prove this far-reaching statement and
to establish the existence of an esoteric and profound
meaning in the &#8220;Essays.&#8221; I shall only refer to a
passage which is ignored by most commentators,
which has been added in the posthumous edition, in
which Montaigne himself admits such a double and
esoteric meaning, and which seems to me to give the
key to the interpretation of the &#8220;Essays&#8221;:

&#8220;I know very well that when I hear anyone dwell
upon the language of my essays, I had rather a great
deal he would say nothing: &#8217;tis not so much to elevate
the style as to depress the sense, and so much the
more offensively as they do it obliquely; and yet I am
much deceived if many other writers deliver more
worth noting as to the matter, and, how well or ill
soever, if any other writer has sown things much more
material, or at all events more downright, upon his
paper than myself. To bring the more in, I only
muster up the heads; should I annex the sequel I
should trebly multiply the volume. And how many
stories have I scattered up and down in this book,[98]
that I only touch upon, which, should anyone more
curiously search into, they would find matter enough
to produce infinite essays. Neither those stories
nor my quotations always serve simply for example,
authority, or ornament; I do not only regard them
for the use I make of them; they carry sometimes,
besides what I apply them to, the seed of a more rich
and a bolder matter, and sometimes, collaterally, a
more delicate sound, both to myself, who will say no
more about it in this place, and to others who shall
be of my humour.&#8221;


IV.

The real and esoteric Montaigne is, like Nietzsche,
a herald of revolt, one of the most revolutionary
thinkers of all times. And the Gascon philosopher
who philosophizes with a smile is far more dangerous
than the Teuton who philosophizes with a hammer.
The corrosive acid of his irony is more destructive
than the violence of the other. Like Nietzsche,
Montaigne transvalues all our moral values. Nothing
is absolute; everything is relative. There is no law
in morals.

&#8220;The laws of conscience, which we pretend to be
derived from nature, proceed from custom; everyone
having an inward veneration for the opinions and
manners approved and received amongst his own
people, cannot, without very great reluctance, depart
from them, nor apply himself to them without
applause.&#8221;

There is no absolute law in politics. And one
form of government is as good as another.[99]

&#8220;Such people as have been bred up to liberty, and
subject to no other dominion but the authority of
their own will, look upon all other forms of government
as monstrous and contrary to nature. Those
who are inured to monarchy do the same; and what
opportunity soever fortune presents them with to
change, even then, when with the greatest difficulties
they have disengaged themselves from one master,
that was troublesome and grievous to them, they
presently run, with the same difficulties, to create
another; being unable to take into hatred subjection
itself.&#8221;

There is no law in religion. There is no justification
in patriotism. The choice of religion is not a
matter of conscience or of reason, but of custom and
climate. We are Christians by the same title as we
are Perigordins or Germans.


V.

If to destroy all human principles and illusions is to
be a sceptic, Montaigne is the greatest sceptic that
ever existed. But Montaigne&#8217;s scepticism is only a
means to an end. On the ruin of all philosophies
and religions Montaigne, like Nietzsche, has built up
a dogmatism of his own. The foundation of that
dogmatism in both is an unbounded faith in life and
in nature. Like Nietzsche, Montaigne is an optimist.
At the very outset of the &#8220;Essays&#8221; he proclaims
the joy of life. He preaches the gaya scienza, the
fr&ouml;hliche Wissenschaft. All our sufferings are due
to our departing from the teachings of Nature. The
chapter on cannibalism, from which Shakespeare has[100]
borrowed a famous passage in &#8220;The Tempest,&#8221; and
which has probably suggested the character of
Caliban, must be taken in literal sense. The savage
who lives in primitive simplicity comes nearer to
Montaigne&#8217;s ideal of perfection than the philosopher
and the saint.


VI.

And this brings us to the fundamental analogy
between Nietzsche and Montaigne. Like the German,
the Frenchman is a pure pagan. Here, again, we
must not be misled by the innumerable professions
of faith, generally added in later editions and not
included in the edition of 1580. Montaigne is uncompromisingly
hostile to Christianity. His Catholicism
must be understood as the Catholicism of Auguste
Comte, defined by Huxley&mdash;namely, Catholicism
minus Christianity. He glorifies suicide. He abhors
the self-suppression of asceticism; he derides chastity,
humility, mortification&mdash;every virtue which we are
accustomed to associate with the Christian faith.
He glorifies self-assertion and the pride of life. Not
once does he express even the most remote sympathy
for the heroes of the Christian Church, for the saints
and martyrs. On the other hand, again and again
he indulges in lyrical raptures for the achievements
of the great men of Greece and Rome. He is an
intellectual aristocrat. His ideal policy is the policy
of the Spartans&mdash;&#8220;almost miraculous in its perfection.&#8221;
His ideal man is the pagan hero&mdash;the
superman of antiquity&mdash;Alcibiades, Epaminondas,
Alexander, Julius C&aelig;sar.[101]


III.&mdash;TREITSCHKE[14] AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF
PRUSSIANISM.

There is a most baneful delusion which has misled
the Allies from the beginning of the war, and which
is still being acted on after three years of a desperate
struggle&mdash;namely, that we are mainly fighting a
sinister political dynasty and a formidable political
machine constructed with all the diabolical ingenuity
and armed with all the resources of the
destructive genius of man. If, indeed, we had only
been confronted by the Kaiser and his paladins, or
only threatened by his military machine, the war
would long ago have been ended&mdash;if not by the Allies,
then by the German people themselves. Millions of
people, however loyal, do not allow themselves to be
slaughtered for a dynast, even though that dynast
claims to be a Superman, even though he be called
Prince of Schwarzburg-Sondershausen or Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt,
even though he be called Prince
Henry XXI. of Reuss of the younger branch or Prince
Henry LXXXVIII. of Reuss of the older branch.
Whole nations do not indefinitely submit to being
the slaves of a machine, however diabolical and however
perfect. The truth is that behind the German
princes and princelings and Junkers there is the
resolve of a united people. Behind the Prussian
machine there is the driving power of tremendous
spiritual and moral forces, of an inflexible purpose, of
a compelling idealism, of a mystical creed accepted
[102]with more than Mohammedan fanaticism. It is that
national purpose, it is those spiritual forces, which
explain the unconquerable pride of the German
people, as evil and as lofty as the pride of Satan in
&#8220;Paradise Lost.&#8221; It is these which explain their
devotion and self-sacrifice, it is these which explain
the Teutonic legions marching to their doom singing
their hymns of love as well as their hymns of hatred.
It is these which explain the two million volunteers
which in August, 1914, went to swell the huge
German conscript armies. It is the obsession of
that mystical German creed which explains the
epic achievements of the German offensive and the
even more astounding achievements of the German
defensive. We may continue to denounce the
crimes of Germany and the atrocities of the German
soldiery&mdash;and I have personally denounced them
until my readers must have got sick of my denunciations.
But there is nothing particularly mysterious
in crimes and atrocities, and crimes and atrocities
alone do not help to explain the German soul.
Crimes and atrocities do not make us understand
how even to-day the German hosts are still able to
challenge a whole world in arms.

Let us, then, take in the vital fact that after three
years those German spiritual forces, those perverted
German ideals, remain the most formidable obstacle
in our path. We may continue to destroy the
German armies by the slow process of attrition, and
we may continue to sacrifice the flower of our youth
until the process is completed. We may trust to our
superiority in money-power and in man-power, but
unless we also break the moral power of German[103]
ideals, unless we exorcise the spell which possesses
the German mind, unless we triumph in the spiritual
contest as well as in the battle of tanks and howitzers,
unless we overthrow the idols which successive generations
of great teachers and preachers have imposed
on a susceptible, receptive, and docile people, there
will be no early settlement, nor, however long belated,
can there ever be a lasting peace.

The foregoing remarks may justify the following
attempt to interpret and to make intelligible, even
to the most inattentive reader, the creed of one of
the most powerful of those teachers and preachers
who have taken such mysterious and uncanny possession
of the soul of the German nation. Before
1914 none except a few initiated had ever heard of
Treitschke. Since 1914 he has become a household
name and a name of evil import. But to the immense
majority of readers that name, however
familiar and ominous, remains an empty name.
Nomen flatus vocis. And even those to whom the
name conveys something more definite do not trouble
about its meaning. With that strange disbelief in
the power of ideas which is one of our lamentable
weaknesses, and which even the war has not been
able to cure, even yet we have not brought ourselves
to take seriously those terrible theories which have
burnt themselves into the Teutonic imagination.
And so indifferent have we remained to doctrines
so far-reaching and so deadly that the recent publication
of an excellent English translation of Treitschke&#8217;s
&#8220;German History,&#8221; one of the masterpieces of historical
literature, has had to be suspended for the incredible
reason that there was no British public to read it.[104]

On approaching the study of Treitschke&#8217;s works,
we are at once impressed by the inexorable logic of
his political and moral creed. There is, perhaps, no
other instance of a system so splendidly consistent
in its principles. We are told that the great French
naturalist, Cuvier, was able to reconstruct the whole
anatomy of an animal merely through examining
the structure of a tooth or the fragment of a bone.
Applying to the German historian the method which
Cuvier applied to the antediluvian mastodon, we
can reduce the whole complex political philosophy of
Treitschke from a few fundamental principles which
he follows with a single mind, and which the Prussian
State has applied with an equally relentless consistency
both in its internal and in its foreign policy.

It is this magnificent consistency, this confident
dogmatism, which gives us the secret of the enormous
influence of Treitschke on his countrymen, as it explains
the hypnotism of Jean-Jacques Rousseau on a
previous generation. I do not think it would be
easy to overestimate the extent of that influence.
It is true that in one sense Treitschke&#8217;s political
philosophy only expresses the Prussian policy, and
that he did not create it. But when a political ideal
is expounded with such clarity and such force, when
it is propagated with such enthusiasm, when it takes
such exclusive hold of the mind, it becomes a hundred
times more efficient and more dangerous; it acquires
the compelling force and inspires the fanaticism of
religion. Those readers who will follow Treitschke&#8217;s
close reasoning to the end will probably agree with
me that the political creed of which he has been the
apostle and prophet is substantially the same creed[105]
which has plunged Europe into the present world
war, and that, more than any one thinker, much
more certainly than Nietzsche, Treitschke must be
held responsible for the catastrophe.

I have confined myself to expounding the doctrines
of Treitschke. I have not attempted to refute them.
It is not my object to denounce: there is always a
sufficient number of publicists ever ready to undertake
the task of denunciation. I am only trying to understand.
Nor have I dwelt on any side-issues. I have
restricted myself to those simple and fundamental
axioms which have directed the policy of Prussia.
Almost invariably in human history it is only the
simple, sweeping dogmas which obtain universal
acceptance.


I.&mdash;Treitschke as the Representative
Prussian.

There exist in the realm of fiction certain literary
types which are an equal joy to the creative artist
and to the student of human nature. There are
certain malignant diseases which are an inspiration to
the pathologist. And there are criminal cases which
are a revelation to the lawyer: test cases which lead
up to new discoveries and illustrate fundamental
principles. What those classical types of Balzac or
Dostoievski are to the critic, what those diseases and
criminal cases are to the surgeon and the lawyer, the
writings of Treitschke are to the student of history
and politics; they throw a new and vivid light on the
dark and hidden depths of the Prussian mind. They
reveal like no other German writings the meaning of[106]
German policy, the spirit which inspires it. They
explain what without them would have remained unexplained.
He is much more than the historian of
the Prussian State, he is the champion of its ideals.
Much better than Bismarck, or the Kaiser, or than
the &#8220;Clown Prince,&#8221; he makes clear to us the aims
and the aspirations of the Hohenzollern monarchy
and of the German nation.

In the history of literature and thought it is given
to but very few writers thus to become the spokesmen
of a whole people. To achieve such importance a
writer must possess many qualifications. He must
possess a strong and dominating character. He
must be a great literary artist. He must be a clear,
a bold, and an independent thinker. The following
pages will show in how eminent a degree Treitschke
possessed all those qualities and how unreservedly
they were placed at the service of the Prussian cause.


II.&mdash;Treitschke&#8217;s Personality.

The first quality which challenges attention is the
commanding strength of his personality. He combines
the most contradictory gifts: the temperament
of the artist, the imagination of the poet, the inspiring
faith of the idealist, the practical sense of the
realist, and the enthusiasm of the apostle. He always
impresses you with that magnetic sense of power into
which Carlyle impresses his readers. Like Carlyle,
he is a firm believer in the heroic, and he has himself
the temper of a hero. Three of his volumes of essays
bear the significant title, &#8220;Deutsche K&auml;mpfe&#8221;
(&#8220;German Battles&#8221;). All through his career Treitschke[107]
has been fighting his patriotic battles. Obsessed
by his ideals, he always has the courage of his
convictions, and is always ready to suffer for them.
In his early youth he had a painful quarrel with his
father, a Saxon General and a loyal servant of the
Saxon dynasty, because the son would not refrain
from his attacks on Saxon &#8220;particularism&#8221; and
would not abstain from championing the Prussian
cause. Treitschke never evades a difficulty. He is
never swayed by outside influences. He never
dreads contradiction. When facts do not tally with
his favourite theories, he brushes them away. And
he never accepts any compromise. He is all made
of one piece. He has the hardness of granite. He
has never been afraid of unpopularity. He has
always been a loyal friend and an equally staunch
hater.


III.&mdash;Treitschke as a Writer.

&#8220;Le style est l&#8217;homme.&#8221; Never was Buffon&#8217;s
dictum more strikingly verified, and never did any
literary style reveal so completely the personality of
the man. Treitschke&#8217;s style is imperious and aggressive.
It has the ring of the General who gives the
word of command. His sentences are not involved,
as German sentences generally are. They are pregnant
and concise. Treitschke often reminds one of
a writer whom of all others he most cordially detests.
Like Heine, Treitschke is incisive, epigrammatic.
His phrase has always muscle and nerve: it has
warmth and fervour. Treitschke has not the gift of
humour. A German seldom possesses that redeeming[108]
gift. But he wields the weapon of trenchant
irony with terrible force, and he adds the poet&#8217;s power
of vision and the true historian&#8217;s sense of reality
and sense of individuality. He has Macaulay&#8217;s gift
of orderly narrative. He is equally masterly in describing
a battle scene, a meeting of diplomatists,
a revolutionary movement. His picture of the
Congress of Vienna is unsurpassed in historical
literature. Like Saint-Simon, he can sum up a
character in a few lines. German historians are
seldom skilful portrait-painters. Treitschke forms
an exception. His portraits of Talleyrand, of Metternich,
of Tsar Alexander I., of Leopold I., King of the
Belgians, are masterpieces of the literary craft.


IV.&mdash;Treitschke as a Clear and Original
Thinker.

But all those artistic gifts would not have given
him his commanding influence in the world of practical
politics if he had not added the gifts of clear thinking
and luminous exposition, which are so very rare in
Germany. Treitschke is essentially an honest and
systematic thinker. As Professor of History in the
University of Berlin, he was accustomed to make
intricate and abstract subjects interesting and intelligible
to vast audiences of students. We are never
left in any doubt as to his inner meaning. He always
goes straight to the point. There are no equivocations
or mental reservations. He has the brevity
but none of the ambiguity of the lawgiver. There
are no gaps in his reasoning. He moves from one
point to another in orderly sequence. Our intellectual[109]
and artistic joy in following the severe and simple
outline of his political system is only marred by the
thought of the appalling practical consequences of
those doctrines.

And not only is he a clear thinker. He is also an
original and independent thinker. He has not the
professional taint of the German pedant. He has
the German professor&#8217;s minute knowledge of concrete
facts, and his doctrinaire love of abstract principles,
but he is not a mere scholar and teacher. He always
remains the man of the world, and he brings to the
consideration of historical problems the practical
experience which he gained as a journalist and as a
member of the Reichstag. He does not apply any
conventional standards to his judgments of men
and events. He looks at everything from his own
angle. There is a delightful freshness about everything
he writes. He believes that the first duty of
an historian is to be partial. He always follows a
bias, but it is his own bias. In his German history
he has not been content with digging up thousands
of new facts from the recesses of German records; he
gives his own interpretation to the facts. He has
no respect for established fame, for existing theories.
He delights in shocking his readers. In his
&#8220;G&ouml;tzend&auml;mmerung,&#8221; or &#8220;Twilight of the Gods,&#8221;
Nietzsche has shown us how to &#8220;philosophize with
a hammer.&#8221; Treitschke has written history with a
hammer, and all his writings are strewn with the
fragments of broken idols and shattered reputations.[110]


V.&mdash;The Prussian State the Centre of
Treitschke&#8217;s Literary Activities.

All Treitschke&#8217;s activities have centred round one
subject: the history and policy of the Prussian State.
All his loyalties are given to one cause, the supremacy
of the German Empire led by the Prussian State. He
has been a voluminous writer, and he has written on
the most varied subjects. But all those subjects have
only been taken up with the one object of elucidating
Prussian problems and directing Prussian policy.
His studies on Federalism, on the United Netherlands&mdash;by
far the most suggestive survey of Dutch history
which has so far been attempted&mdash;are intended to
solve the problem of the relation of Prussia to the
Federal States of the German Empire. His study
on Cavour and Italian unity was undertaken as an
introduction to the study of German unity. His
admirable monograph on that strange and unique
military theocracy of the Teutonic order was an
essay on the early history of Prussia. His volume
on Bonapartism was a study of the chief political
opponent of Prussian supremacy. Briefly, all his
volumes of essays have been preparatory to his life-work,
the history of Germany, and the history of
Germany itself is always kept subordinate to the
history of the Prussian State.


VI.&mdash;Treitschke&#8217;s Treatise on Politics.

It is much to be regretted that the British public
should have been first introduced to Treitschke&#8217;s
&#8220;History of Germany.&#8221; The &#8220;History of Germany[111]&#8221;
is, no doubt, the most important and the most monumental,
but it is by no means the most interesting
nor the most significant of Treitschke&#8217;s writings.
German history could never be as arresting to a
Continental student as British or French history.
It is not mixed up with universal events. It is too
parochial. It does not evoke human sympathy.
With all the magic of Treitschke&#8217;s art, we feel that
we are following, not the great highway, but one of
the by-ways of history. We cannot get absorbed in
the petty quarrels of the princelings of the German
Federation. Of the five volumes of Treitschke&#8217;s
&#8220;German History,&#8221; the only part which is of general
interest is the first volume, dealing with the rise of
Prussia, the reign of Frederick the Great and his
successors, the Napoleonic wars, and the Congress of
Vienna.

As often happens, it is mainly through his minor
writings that Treitschke will live&mdash;through his
&#8220;Cavour,&#8221; his &#8220;United Netherlands,&#8221; his &#8220;Bonapartism,&#8221;
and his Biographical Essays. But to
the philosophical student by far the most important
of Treitschke&#8217;s writings are his two volumes on the
Science of Politics, which are, without exception, the
most fascinating and the most suggestive political
treatise published in this generation. Political
treatises are proverbially dull and out of touch
with reality. Treitschke&#8217;s treatise is a solitary exception.
To him politics are not, like mathematics,
an abstract or a deductive science. We cannot build
an ideal political structure in the air. The political
thinker must be more modest in his ambitions. He
cannot adduce first principles. All politics must be[112]
Realpolitik. All politics must be based on concrete
historical facts&mdash;i.e., circumscribed in time and
space. Indeed, strictly considered, political philosophy
is only applied history. That is why political
treatises are so disappointing. The philosopher is
content to generalize, and does not know the facts.
On the other hand, the historian who knows the facts
has not the capacity of generalization. Politics must
be mainly empirical. The political thinker does not
reason forward from the past to the present, but
backwards from the present to the past. He studies
the present results of the mature experience of many
ages, and then explains the distant past in the light
of the present.


VII.&mdash;Prussia the Sole Standard of
Political Values.

Not only has Prussian history been the centre of
all Treitschke&#8217;s activities; it also supplies him with
the sole standard of all political values, the sole test
of the truth of all political theories. With superb
logic he deduces all his political system from the
vicissitudes of the Brandenburg State. His sympathies
and antipathies, his affinities and repulsions,
are Prussian. Prussia and the German Empire have
monopolized all human virtues. His only enemies
are the enemies of the Prussian State (see paragraphs
VIII. and IX. of this Essay).

Prussia is a national State, exclusive, self-sufficient,
self-contained. Therefore, the national State is the
supreme and final political reality (see paragraph XI.).

All the theories which challenge or threaten this[113]
conception of the national State are dismissed by
Treitschke as damnable heresies: the heresy of individualism
(see paragraph XII.), the heresy of
internationalism (see paragraph XIII.), and the
heresy of imperialism (paragraph XIV.).

The one aim of the Prussian State has been the
extension of Prussian power. Therefore the will to
power must be the fundamental dogma of the State
(paragraph XV.).

Prussia has always subordinated political ethics to
national aggrandizement; therefore Treitschke holds
with Machiavelli that in politics the end justifies
the means (paragraph XVI.).

Prussia has only expanded through war. War has
been the national industry of the Prussian people.
Therefore war is considered by Treitschke as the
vital principle of national life (paragraph XVII.).

Prussia has been the family estate of the Hohenzollern
dynasty; therefore the monarchy must be
considered as the ideal form of government (paragraph
XVIII.).

The Prussian military aristocracy of Junkers have
been the mainstay of the Prussian State; therefore
an aristocratic government is a corollary of the
monarchic form of government, and the French
democratic theory of government is the arch-heresy
(paragraphs XIX. and XX.).

Prussia has been the leading Protestant State;
therefore Roman Catholicism must be held to be inconsistent
with the prosperity of any modern polity
(paragraph XXI.).

Prussia, from a small straggling territory, has
grown to be one of the leading Powers of Europe by[114]
the gradual absorption of all the surrounding small
States; therefore only great Powers have a right to
exist (paragraph XXII.); therefore small States are
a monstrosity (paragraph XXIII.).


VIII.&mdash;Treitschke&#8217;s Political Paganism.

There is no counterpart in modern history to the
development of the Prussian State, no political
structure so entirely self-contained and self-sufficient,
which has so continuously pursued its own selfish
ends. For an exact analogy it is necessary to revert
to ancient history; therefore Treitschke&#8217;s sympathies
go to the ancient State much more than to the modern
State. In his religion he is a devout Lutheran. But
in his political conceptions he is entirely pagan. To
him the politics of Aristotle remain the fountain of
all political wisdom. The modern man in order
to understand the majesty of the State must free himself
of a whole mass of acquired notions. In quiet
and peaceful times the average man may pursue his
private avocations and hardly give a thought to the
State. It was different in antiquity. The ancient
city State was everything, and was felt to be everything,
so that the citizen could not conceive himself
as apart from the State. That is why they had a much
stronger and healthier political sense, an instinctive
comprehension for, and a passionate devotion to, the
State. The moderns have ceased to live and move
in the State. They are divided and distracted by
their social and economic interests. Only the modern
Prussian feels for Prussia as the Roman and the
Spartan felt for their native countries. To the[115]
Prussian alone, as to the Roman and the Spartan,
the devotion to the State is glorified into a religion,
the religion of patriotism.


IX.&mdash;Treitschke&#8217;s Antipathies and Hatreds.

Even as his sympathies, so are Treitschke&#8217;s antipathies
determined by his Prussian preconceptions.
Whatever is alien to Prussian ideals is odious to
Treitschke. Whoever has opposed the growth of
the Prussian State or threatened its future becomes
a personal enemy. And, as every State has had
to oppose the predatory policy of Prussia, and is
threatened by its ambitions, as, to use Treitschke&#8217;s
own words, &#8220;Prussia was the best hated of all the
German States from the first days of her independent
history,&#8221; the antipathies of the Prussian historian
are almost universal. And what a fierce hater he is;
what unlimited power of vituperation; what intensity
of bitter feeling! He hates Talleyrand, Lord Palmerston,
King Leopold of Belgium, with a personal
animosity. He hates Britain and France. He hates
Austria and the small German Principalities. He
hates Belgium and Holland; and, above all, he
loathes and despises the Jews.


X.&mdash;Treitschke&#8217;s Hatred of the Jews.

No nation inspires Treitschke with a more instinctive
repulsion than the Jews. He may be called
the father of scientific and pedantic anti-Semitism.
In other nations anti-Semitism was only an instinctive
and irrational popular feeling. In Treitschke anti-Semitism[116]
becomes a systematic doctrine. It becomes
part of a political creed. Treitschke hates the Jews
because they are unwarlike, because they are absorbed
in material interests, because they are Atheists.
He abhors the Gospel according to Saint Marx. He
denounces the cynicism of Heine. He dreads the
influence of the Jewish Press. But, above all, he
hates the Jews because they are denationalized,
because they have no stake in the prosperity and greatness
of the national State. The Jews are wanderers
without a settled existence, without allegiance and
loyalty except to their own race. The dual political
life which the Jews are leading as members of the
Jewish nation and as parasites of other national
States to which they have temporarily migrated is a
permanent menace to a healthy national German life.
Everywhere the Jews are revolutionists, anarchists,
Atheists. All the leaders of the German Social
Democracy&mdash;Lassalle, Marx, Engels, Kautsky, Bernstein&mdash;are
Hebrews. It is the imperative duty of
all Prussian patriots to guard the people against the
Jewish danger, against Jewish journalism, Jewish
finance, Jewish materialism, Jewish socialism, and
Jewish internationalism.


XI.&mdash;The Theory of the National State.

Let us revert to the starting-point of Treitschke&#8217;s
politics, which is the theory of the national State.
Only in the national State can the individual realize
the higher moral and political life. The State is not
part of a larger whole. It is in itself a self-contained
whole. It is not a means to an end; it is an end in[117]
itself. It is not a relative conception; it is an absolute.
The French people may fight for humanity.
A St. Louis may be inspired with the crusading spirit.
Treitschke has no sympathy for such quixotism. The
national State must be selfish. To be unselfish is the
mortal sin of politics. Humanity, sentimentalism,
have no place in politics. Frederick William IV.,
the one sentimental King in the whole history of the
Hohenzollern Dynasty, once rendered an unselfish
service to his neighbours. A Prussian army saved
the Saxon monarchy from revolution and then withdrew.
Treitschke has no words strong enough to
condemn this solitary instance of a disinterested
Prussian policy.

The national State is alone invested with the
attributes of sovereignty. There is nothing above it.
National rights must be final. The national State
may for the time being limit its absolute sovereignty
by international agreements, but any such agreements
are only conditional and temporary&mdash;rebus sic
stantibus. No national State can make international
agreements which are binding for the future. The
time must always come when the scrap of paper has
to be torn asunder. It is true that the national State
is indirectly playing its part in the moral education
of humanity, but it will best serve humanity by only
thinking of itself.


XII.&mdash;The Heresy of Individualism.

There are many heresies which threaten the orthodox
religion of the national State. The first and
the most dangerous is the heresy of individualism.[118]
A school of modern theorists, William von Humboldt
and John Stuart Mill, have asserted the rights of
the individual apart from and above the rights of
the State. They reserve for the individual a sphere
where the State may not encroach. According to
Mill, the political life is only a part and the minor
part of his social activities. His higher activities
are spent in the service of the Church, in the service
of Art and Science.

Treitschke has fought this heresy of individualism
in all his writings. The interest of the individual
cannot be opposed to the interest of the State. The
individual can only realize himself, he can only
realize the higher life, in and through the State. It
is the State which sets free the spiritual forces of the
individual by securing for him security, prosperity,
and economic independence.


XIII.&mdash;The Heresy of Internationalism.

The second deadly heresy which threatens the
dogma of the national State is the heresy of internationalism.
It takes the form either of the black
internationalism of the Catholic Church or the red
internationalism of Social Democracy. Treitschke
has fought Roman Catholicism and its champions,
the Jesuits, with relentless hate. Through all his
writings there sounds the watchword of Voltaire, the
spiritual adviser of Frederick the Great, &#8220;&Eacute;crasez
l&#8217;inf&acirc;me,&#8221; and the battle-cry of Gambetta, &#8220;Le
clericalisme, voil&agrave; l&#8217;ennemi.&#8221; Nor is he less bitter
against the Socialists. Bismarck and the Kaiser
opposed the encroachments of the Social Democracy[119]
in a succession of anti-Socialist repressive measures.
Treitschke may have disapproved of some of the
Sozialisten Gesetze because they defeated their purpose.
But he shares the Kaiser&#8217;s hatred against those irreconcilable
enemies of Prussian greatness. The Social
Democratic theories of the Jews&mdash;Lassalle, Marx, and
Bernstein&mdash;are one of the most deadly poisons that
imperil the constitution of the German body politic.

Events have shown how little even Treitschke
realized the strength of the Prussian State and the
fanaticism of German nationalism. We know how
little his dread of the black International of Catholicism
and the red International of Socialism has been
justified by the servile attitude of all the Opposition
parties, and how, when the crisis came, both Catholics
and Socialists proved as Prussian as the Junkers of
Pomerania.


XIV.&mdash;The Heresy of Imperialism.

If it be true that the citizen can only realize himself
through the national State, if the whole course
of human history is essentially a conflict of national
States, and if the rich variety of civilization is made
up of the rivalry of those national States, it logically
follows that the expansion of any national State into
a world empire must necessarily be baneful. The
State must, no doubt, expand, but there is a limit
to that expansion. The State must not incorporate
any alien races which it cannot assimilate. When
the State is unable to absorb heterogeneous elements
and grows into a world empire, it becomes a danger
both to itself and to humanity.[120]

Civilization has been threatened in the past by
such monstrous conglomerates of heterogeneous
nations. It has been threatened by the Spanish
tyranny of Charles V. and the French tyranny of
Louis XIV. and Napoleon. It is still threatened
to-day by a similar danger. Two national States,
Great Britain and Russia, have again grown into
world empires. If their ambitions were to succeed,
if the greater part of the civilized world were to
become either Anglo-Saxon or Russian, there would
be an end to the diversity and the liberty of modern
civilization. Only the good sword of Prussia and
Germany can save humanity from that Anglo-Saxon
and Slav peril.


XV.&mdash;The Dogma of the &#8220;Will to Power.&#8221;

But the fact that there is danger in the unlimited
expansion of the national State ought not to prevent
us from recognizing that irresistible tendency to
expansion. The &#8220;will to power&#8221; is the essence of
the State. &#8220;The State is power&#8221; (Der Staat ist
Macht) must ever be the first axiom of political
science. Muddled political thinkers, who confuse
the spiritual with the temporal activities of man,
may hold that the end of the State is social justice, or
the diffusion of light, or the propagation of religion,
or the advancement of humanity. But the cause of
justice, the spread of education, will best be furthered
if the State is strong. Only the strong can be
just, partial, and enlightened. The sole criterion
of political values is strength. It is the supreme
merit of Machiavelli that he has been the first to[121]
emphasize this cardinal truth. The mortal sin of
a State is to be weak. Only the strong man, only a
Bismarck, a Richelieu, a Cavour, is a true statesman.

And that strength of the State which is its chief
attribute must not be dispersed; that political power
must neither be divided nor alienated. Many writers
on politics still echo the absurd theory of Montesquieu
on the division of the executive, legislative, and the
judiciary. Treitschke, following Rousseau, lays down
the axiom that the power of the State is indivisible
and inalienable.


XVI.&mdash;The End justifies the Means.

If the one virtue of the State is to be strong and
to assert its strength, it follows that the ethics of the
State cannot be the ethics of the individual. The
ruler of the State is not the head of a monastery or
the president of an academy of fine arts. The end
must justify the means, and any means may be employed
which will add to the strength of the State.
It is the glory of Frederick the Great that he has
always had the moral courage of brushing away conventions
and scruples to achieve his object, and that
he has always had the political insight and wisdom
of adjusting the means to the end.


XVII.&mdash;War as the Vital Principle of
Political Life.

Prussia is not, like France, the result of a thousand
years of natural growth. It has no definite natural
boundaries. The Prussian State is an artificial
creation. It has grown and expanded through conquest.[122]
It is the Order of the Teutonic Knights, it is
the warrior dynasty of the Hohenzollern, who have
built up Prussian power. That purely military
growth of the Prussian State is made by Treitschke
into a universal rule of all political growth. According
to him war always was and will remain the
master-builder of national life. Other thinkers, like
Joseph de Maistre, have glorified war in the name
of theology. Treitschke extols it in the name of
politics. War not only makes a State: it makes the
citizen. The heroic virtues are warlike virtues; they
are the outcome of military institutions. It is not
war but peace which is the evil. Woe to the nation
which allows itself to be deceived by the sentiment
and cowardice of pacifists.


XVIII.&mdash;The Monarchy as the Ideal Form
of Government.

War is the essential activity of the State. But in
order to be strong in war, unity and concentration are
essential; they are the conditions of victory. That
unity may, no doubt, be achieved under any form of
government. It may be achieved under a republic,
as it was during the wars of the French Revolution.
It may be achieved under an aristocracy, as in the
case of Great Britain, which is a monarchy only in
name, which, in reality, is a Parliamentary oligarchy,
and which is always waging some guerilla in some
outlying post of empire. But the fact remains that
unity can be best achieved under a monarchic form
of government, which concentrates all powers into
the hands of the responsible monarch. That is why
monarchy is the best form of government.[123]


XIX.&mdash;The Aristocracy as the Mainstay of
the Monarchic State.

A loyal military aristocracy like the Junkers is
the mainstay of a national monarchy. An aristocratic
constitution of the State is in conformity with
the nature of things. Not only all military activities
but all social and economic life depends on the
distinction of classes, on the existence of different
grades corresponding to a difference in natural endowment,
in social service. The equality of man not
only is an unattainable ideal, it is also an undesirable
and a mischievous ideal. Suppress inequality and
distinctions and honours and you suppress the main
stimulus of human endeavour; you suppress that rich
differentiation of social life, that generous rivalry,
that noble ambition, which are the conditions of
all intensive human activity.


XX.&mdash;The French Revolutionary Dogma
of Equality.

The greatest danger, therefore, to the monarchic and
aristocratic constitution of the State arises from the
insidious advance of the French revolutionary dogma
of equality. The spirit of envy is undermining
the social hierarchy in every country. That mean
spirit of democratic envy is as old as the democratic
institution itself. Ostracism in the nobler elements
of the community is as characteristic of the Greek
democracy as of the French. All democracies have
resented that Aristides should be called the &#8220;Just.&#8221;
So far it is only the Prussian State which has escaped[124]
from the poisonous doctrine of Rousseau. But even
in Prussia the progress of the Gospel according to
Saint Marx is a disquieting symptom. To defend
the prerogatives of the Junkers against the assaults
of the Social Democracy must therefore be one of
the main political concerns of a patriotic Prussian.


XXI.&mdash;The Plea for Protestantism.

It may be said that Protestantism is so closely
identified with modern German history that it may
almost be considered as the Germanic form of Christianity.
Certainly Prussia is an essentially Protestant
State. From the beginning it has grown from the
secularization of Church property, when a Hohenzollern
Grand Master, following the advice of Luther,
took the bold step of confiscating the demesnes of
the Teutonic Order. But it is not only Prussia that
has grown and prospered through Protestantism.
The Protestant form of Christianity in whatever
form is essential to the very existence of the modern
State. For no State can exist unless the spiritual
power be subordinated to the temporal power.
The Protestant Church must needs accept that
subordination because Protestantism must necessarily
result in a diversity of rival and powerless sects, and
therefore, if it be true that Protestantism is necessary
for the State, the State is even more necessary to
Protestantism. The old dictum, Cujus regio, illius
religio, holds good of Prussia. The spiritual allegiance
follows the temporal allegiance. The State
alone can secure for those different Churches that
peace and toleration without which religious war[125]
becomes a chronic evil. Toleration and the peaceful
coexistence of many Churches under the protection
of the State have been for centuries the boast and
glory of the Prussian State.

Catholicism does not accept that necessary subordination.
The German State of the Middle Ages,
the Holy Roman Empire of the Hohenstaufen,
perished because of the conflict with the Papacy.
The modern Teutonic State, the Holy German
Empire of the Habsburg, has equally perished
through clericalism. Catholicism is an international
power, and the State must be national. Catholicism
is encroaching and threatening the national State,
and the State must remain independent and supreme;
therefore Catholicism, ultramontanism, clericalism,
are absolutely incompatible with the modern State.


XXII.&mdash;The Necessity of Great Powers.

Inasmuch as power is the main attribute of the
State, it follows that only those States which are
sufficiently strong in population, in territory, and in
financial resources, have a right to exist. There is a
definite limit below which a State cannot fulfil its
mission nor defend its existence. We must not be
deceived by the example of such States as Athens,
Venice, Holland, and Florence, which, although apparently
small in territory, yet played an important
part in political history. Those States were only
small in outward appearance; in reality they were
either the centres of a vast political system, like
Athens and Florence, or the centres of a vast colonial
empire, like Venice and Holland. Moreover, in[126]
modern times, the whole relations and proportions
of States have undergone a fundamental change.
Everything is on a larger scale, and there is an
almost general tendency in modern times for all
national States to expand and to absorb into themselves
the smaller neighbouring States. It may
almost be said that modern history is made up mainly
of the conflicts between five or six leading States.
Contemporary Europe had resulted in the unstable
equilibrium of the five dominant Powers of Britain,
Russia, Austria, France, and Germany. Europe has
almost consolidated into a pentarchy.


XXIII.&mdash;The Anomaly of the Small State.

If it be true that the national State almost inevitably
must develop into a great Power, conversely it
is no less true that small States are an anomaly.
Treitschke never ceased to rail at the monstrosity of
petty States, at what he calls, with supreme contempt,
the &#8220;Kleinstaaterei.&#8221; Holland, Denmark,
Switzerland, are not really States. They are only
artificial and temporary structures. Holland will
one day be merged into the German Empire and
recover its pristine glory.

The smallness of the State produces a corresponding
meanness of spirit, a narrowness of outlook.
Small States are entirely absorbed by their petty
economic interests and party dissensions. They only
exist as the parasites of the larger States, who ensure
their prosperity and security and bear all the brunt
of maintaining law and order in Europe.

But worse even than the small States is the neutral[127]
State. A neutral State in political life is as much a
monstrosity as a neutral sexless animal in the natural
world. A State like Belgium is only the parasite
of the larger neighbouring States. Treitschke never
mentions Belgium without an outburst of contempt.
The country of Memlinck and van Eyck, of Rubens
and van Dyck, the country whose people in the
present war have borne the first onslaught of all the
Teutonic hosts, are never mentioned by Treitschke
except with a sneer.

In no other part of his political system does
Treitschke show more sublime disregard of all those
political facts which do not fit in with his theories.
No other part more conclusively proves how the
tyrannical dogma of Prussian nationalism can blind
even a profound and clear-sighted thinker to the most
vital historical realities. It must be apparent a
priori to any student of politics that the life of small
communities must gain in concentration and intensity
what it loses in scope and extent. And it must be
obvious that small States have played a much more
conspicuous part than the most powerful empires.
The city of Dante, Machiavelli, Michael Angelo, has
done more for culture than all the might and majesty
of the Hohenzollern. Humanity is indebted to one
small State&mdash;Palestine&mdash;for its religion. To another
small State&mdash;Greece&mdash;humanity owes the beginning
of all art and the foundations of politics. To other
small States&mdash;Holland and Scotland&mdash;modern
Europe is indebted for its political freedom. And
are not the German people themselves indebted for
the glories of their literature to the contemptible
cities of Jena and Weimar?[128]


XXIV.

We have explained the main tenets of the Treitschkean
creed. Even after this exhaustive analysis it
will be difficult for an English reader to understand
how such a system, if we divest it of its rhetoric, of
its fervid and impassioned style, and of a wealth of
historical illustration, which has been able to ransack
every country and every age, could ever have inspired
a policy and could have hypnotized so completely a
highly intelligent and gifted race.

Our incomprehension is partly due to that strange
disbelief in the power of ideas to which we already
referred, which remains such a marked trait of the
British people, even as it was a marked trait of the
Roman people, and which is perhaps characteristic
of all nations who are pre-eminent in action, in
colonization and empire-building. This disbelief
partly explains why we have revealed such strange
impotence in fighting our spiritual battles. Our
Churches have remained silent and inarticulate.
Our statesmen have seldom risen above sentimental
platitudes. No trumpet voice has vindicated our
ideas to the world. Our writers, with a few notable
exceptions, such as Mr. Gilbert Chesterton and Mr.
Wells, have seldom risen above trite truisms. This
war has not even produced a masterpiece such as
Burke&#8217;s &#8220;Thoughts on the French Revolution.&#8221;

But our incomprehension is due even more to our
ignorance of the strange and devious workings of the
German mind. Even to-day few authors understand
the reasons which render the German people so[129]
responsive and so docile to the most extravagant
doctrines and systems. The British are a political
people; and a political people only accepts theories
in so far as they can be verified, interpreted, and
corrected by experience, only in so far as they can be
tested by the fire of discussion. The German people,
as even Prince von B&uuml;low is compelled to admit,
have remained an essentially unpolitical people.
They still are under the yoke of countless princelings.
There still exist sovereign potentates of Lippe
and Waldeck, of Schwarzburg-Sondershausen and
Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt. The Germans have acquired
none of the habits and traditions of free
government. But, most important of all, their
religion has acted in the same direction as their
politics. They are described by Treitschke as the
typical Protestant nation; but the misfortune of
German Protestantism has been that it has never
&#8220;protested.&#8221; Through the fusion and confusion
of Church and State the Germans have sold their
spiritual birthright for a mess of pottage. Their
spiritual life has been almost entirely divorced from
action. It has been centred in the intellect and in the
emotions. It has moved in a world of abstraction
and dreams.

And thus both their politics and their religion have
made them a prey to visionaries and sentimentalists,
to unscrupulous journalists like Harden and Reventlow,
to unbalanced poets like Nietzsche, to political
professors, and to fanatic doctrinaires. Of those
academic politicians and fanatic doctrinaires, Treitschke
has probably been the most dangerous and the
most illustrious representative. He will ever remain[130]
a memorable example of the power for evil which
may be wielded by a noble and passionate temperament
untrained in and unrestrained by the realities
of political life, who sees the State from the altitude
of the professional tripod. The war will have helped
to break the spell of the political professor, but the
spell will continue to act until all the spiritual forces
of Germany, until the Press and the Universities and
the Churches, are emancipated from the intrusion of
the State, until the German democracy reveals both
the spirit and conquers the power to achieve its own
salvation.


IV.&mdash;GENERAL VON BERNHARDI.[15]

As a rule the deliberate military policy of a nation
remains the secret of diplomacy and the afterthought
of statecraft. As for the military feeling and the
military spirit, so far as they exist amongst the people,
they generally remain subconscious, unreasoned, and
instinctive. It is therefore a piece of rare good
fortune to the student of contemporary history when
the designs of statesmen are carefully thought out
and revealed by one who has authority to speak,
and when the instinct of the masses is explained
and made explicit by one who has the gift of lucid
statement, of philosophical interpretation, and psychological
insight. It is precisely those qualities
and characteristics that give importance and significance
to the recent book of General von Bernhardi
on &#8220;Germany and the Coming War.&#8221; The author
[131]is a distinguished representative of that Prussian
Junkerthum which forms the mainstay of the military
party and which rules the German Empire. He therefore
speaks from the inside. And his previous works
have earned him a high reputation as an exponent of
the science of war, and have worthily maintained
the traditions of Clausewitz and von der Goltz.
Nor are these the only qualifications of the author.
General von Bernhardi&#8217;s new book possesses other
qualities which entitle him to a respectful hearing.
He writes with absolute candour and sincerity; his
tone is unexceptionable; he is earnest and dignified;
he is moderate and temperate; he is judicial rather
than controversial. Although the author believes,
of course, that Germany stands in the forefront of
civilization and has a monopoly of the highest culture,
yet his book is singularly free from the one great
blemish which defaces most German books on international
politics&mdash;namely, systematic depreciation of
the foreigner. Von Bernhardi does not assume that
France is played out or that England is effete. He
is too well read in military history not to realize that
to belittle the strength or malign the character of an
enemy is one of the most fruitful causes of disaster.

Altogether we could not have a better guide to the
study of the present international situation from
the purely German point of view, nor could we find
another book which gives us more undisguisedly the
&#8220;mentality,&#8221; the prejudices and prejudgments and
opinions of the ruling classes. And it is a characteristically
German trait that no less than one-third
of the work should be given to the philosophy and
ethics of the subject. General von Bernhardi surveys[132]
the field from the vantage-ground of first principles,
and his book is a convincing proof of a truth which we
have expressed elsewhere that in Prussia war is not
looked upon as an accident, but as a law of nature;
and not only as a law of nature, but as the law of
man, or if not as the law of man, certainly as the law
of the &#8220;German superman.&#8221; It is not enough to
say that war has been the national industry of Prussia.
It forms an essential part of the philosophy of life,
the Weltanschauung of every patriotic Prussian. Bernhardi
believes in the morality, one might almost
say in the sanctity, of war. To him war is not a
necessary evil, but, on the contrary, the source of
every moral good. To him it is pacificism which is
an immoral doctrine, because it is the doctrine of
the materialist, who believes that enjoyment is the
chief end of life. It is the militarist who is the true
idealist because he assumes that humanity can only
achieve its mission through struggle and strife,
through sacrifice and heroism. It is true that
Bernhardi ignores the greatest of Prussian philosophers,
whose immortal plea in favour of perpetual
peace is dismissed as the work of his dotage. But
if he dismisses Kant, he adduces instead a formidable
array of thinkers and poets in support of his militarist
thesis; Schiller and Goethe, Hegel and Heraclitus, in
turn are summoned as authorities. Even the Gospels
are distorted to convey a militarist meaning, for the
author quotes them to remind us that it is the warlike
and not the meek that shall inherit the earth. But
Bernhardi&#8217;s chief authorities are the historian of
the super-race, the Anglophobe Treitschke, and the
philosopher of the superman, Nietzsche. Nine out of[133]
ten quotations are taken from the political treatises
of the famous Berlin professor, and the whole spirit
of Bernhardi&#8217;s book is summed up in the motto
borrowed from Zarathustra and inscribed on the front
page of the volume:

&#8220;War and courage have achieved more great things
than the love of our neighbour. It is not your sympathy,
but your bravery, which has hitherto saved
the shipwrecked of existence.

&#8220;&#8216;What is good?&#8217; you ask. To be brave is
good.&#8221;[16]

It is no less characteristic of contemporary German
political philosophy that from beginning to end
Bernhardi maintains consciously, deliberately, a
purely national attitude, and that he does not even
attempt to rise to a higher and wider point of view.
Indeed, the main issue and cardinal problem, the
relation of nationality to humanity, the conflict
between the duties we owe to the one and the duties
we owe to the other, is contemptuously relegated
to a footnote (p. 19). To Bernhardi a nation is not
a means to an end, a necessary organ of universal
humanity, and therefore subordinate to humanity.
A nation is an end in itself. It is the ultimate reality.
And the preservation and the increase of the power
of the State is the ultimate criterion of all right.
&#8220;My country, right or wrong,&#8221; is the General&#8217;s whole
system of moral philosophy. Yet, curiously enough,
Bernhardi speaks of Germany as the apostle, not only
of a national culture, but of universal culture, as
the champion of civilization, and he indulges in the
[134]usual platitudes on this fertile subject. And he does
not even realize that in so doing he is guilty of a
glaring contradiction; he does not realize that once
he adopts this standpoint of universal culture, he
introduces an argument and assumes a position which
are above and outside nationalism. For either the
German nation is self-sufficient, and all culture is
centred in and absorbed in Germany, in which case
Prussian nationalism would be historically and
philosophically justified; or culture is something
higher and more comprehensive and less exclusive,
in which case national aims must be estimated and
appraised with reference to a higher aim, and a
national policy must be judged according as it
furthers or runs counter to the universal ideals of
humanity.

General von Bernhardi starts his survey of the
international situation with the axiom that Germany
imperatively wants new markets for her industry and
new territory for her sixty-five millions of people.
In so doing, he only reiterates the usual assumption
of German political writers. And he also resembles
the majority of his fellow-publicists in this respect,
that he does not tell us what exactly are the territories
that Germany covets, or how they are to be obtained,
or how the possession of tropical or subtropical
colonies can solve the problem of her population.
But he differs from his predecessors in that he clearly
realizes and expresses, without ambiguity or equivocation,
that the assertion of her claims must involve
the establishment of German supremacy, and he admits
that those claims are incompatible with the
antiquated doctrine of the balance of power. And[135]
von Bernhardi also clearly realizes that, as other
nations will refuse to accept German supremacy and
to surrender those fertile territories which Germany
needs, German expansion can only be achieved as
the result of a conflict&mdash;briefly, that war is unavoidable
and inevitable.

CHAPTER V[136]

FREDERICK THE GREAT: THE FATHER OF
PRUSSIAN MILITARISM


I.

Amongst the many discoveries brought about by
the war of the nations, an educated British public
has suddenly discovered the unsuspected existence
of Heinrich von Treitschke. And not only have we
discovered the national Prussian historian&mdash;we have
also unwittingly discovered Prussian history. We
have certainly had revealed to us for the first time
its secret and hidden meaning. We are only just
beginning to realize that for nearly two hundred
years it is Prussia, and not Russia, which has been the
evil influence in European politics. Prussia has not
been a natural political growth. She has been an
artificial creation of statesmen. She has been pre-eminently
the predatory State. She has never taken
the sword to defend a disinterested idea. The
ravisher of Silesia, of Schleswig-Holstein, of Alsace-Lorraine,
the murderer of Poland, she has never
expanded except at the expense of her neighbours.
She has corrupted the German soul; she has been
the mainstay of reaction and militarism in Central
Europe. She has been the bond of that freemasonry[137]
of despotism, of that Triple Alliance of the three
empires which subsisted until the fall of Bismarck,
which has been for generations the nightmare of
European Liberals.


II.

In attempting to reread modern history in the light
of that new interpretation of Prussian history, we
are naturally driven to ask ourselves who is primarily
responsible for that sinister influence which Prussia
has exercised for the last two centuries. To the unprejudiced
student there can be no doubt that the
one man primarily responsible is Frederick the Great,
the master-builder of Prussian militarism and Prussian
statecraft. He it is who has been poisoning the wells;
he it is who first conceived of the State as a barracks;
he it is who has &#8220;Potsdamized&#8221; the Continent and
transformed Europe into a military camp. Strangely
enough, all civilized nations to-day have proclaimed
Prussia accursed. Yet we continue to hero-worship
the man who made Prussia what she is. A halo
still surrounds the Mephistophelian figure which
incarnates the Hohenzollern spirit. A legend has
gathered round the philosopher of Sans Souci. A
combination of circumstances has caused writers
almost unanimously to extol his merits and to ignore
his crimes. British historians naturally favour the
ally of the Seven Years&#8217; War. Russian and Austrian
writers are indulgent to the accomplice of the partition
of Poland. Anti-clerical writers glorify the Atheist.
Military writers extol the soldier. Political writers
extol the statesman. But the most adequate explanation[138]
of the Frederician legend is the circumstance
that public opinion has been systematically
mobilized in favour of Frederick the Great by the
great French leaders of the eighteenth century, the
dispensers of European fame.

It was not for nothing that Frederick the Great for
forty years courted the good graces of Voltaire
d&#8217;Alembert. He knew full well that Voltaire would
prove to him a most admirable publicity agent.
And never was publicity agent secured at a lower cost.
Those literary influences have continued to our own
day to perpetuate the legend of Frederick. Nearly
a hundred years after Rossbach Frederick had the
strange good fortune to captivate the wayward
genius of Carlyle. It is difficult to understand how
Carlyle, who all through life hesitated between the
Christian Puritanism of John Knox and the Olympian
paganism of Goethe, could have been fascinated by
the Potsdam cynic. We can only seek for an explanation
in the deeply rooted anti-French and pro-German
prejudices of Carlyle. Frederick was the
arch-enemy of France, and that fact was sufficient
to attract the sympathies of Teufelsdr&ouml;ckh. It is
Carlyle&#8217;s Gallophobia which has inspired one of the
most mischievous masterpieces of English literature.


III.

The conspiracy of European historians has thus
attached greatness to the very name of the third
Hohenzollern King. Great the Hohenzollern King
certainly was, but his greatness is that of a Condottiere
of the Italian Renascence, of a Catharine de[139]&#8217;
Medici. It is the greatness of a personality who is
endowed, no doubt, with magnificent gifts, but who
has prostituted all those gifts to the baser usages.

It is passing strange how every writer remains
silent about the ugly and repellent side of Frederick.
The son of a mad father, he was subjected to a
terrorism which would have predestined a less strong
nature to the lunatic asylum. The terrorism only
hardened Frederick into an incurable cynic. It only
killed in him every finer feeling. His upbringing
must almost inevitably have brought out all the
darker sides of human nature.

The first twenty years of his life were one uninterrupted
schooling in hypocrisy, brutality, and
depravity. A debauchee in his youth, a sodomite in
later life, a hater of women and a despiser of men,
a bully to his subordinates, a monster of ingratitude,
revelling in filth so continuously in his written and
spoken words that even a loyal Academy of Berlin
has found it impossible to publish his unexpurgated
correspondence, he appears an anachronism in a
modern Europe leavened by two thousand years of
Christianity. Ever scheming, ever plotting, ever
seeking whom he might devour, deceiving even his
intimate advisers, he has debased the currency of
international morality. As a man Frederick has been
compared with Napoleon. The comparison is an
insult to the Corsican. Napoleon was human, he
was capable of strong affections, of profound attachment
and gratitude. But neither friendship nor love
had any place in Frederick&#8217;s scheme of the universe.[140]


IV.

To-day we are holding the poor Prussian professor
mainly accountable for the greatest and latest crime
of Prussian militarism. But those dogmatic professors
are only the abject disciples of the Hohenzollern
King. There is not one aphorism which is
not to be found in the thirty volumes of Frederick&#8217;s
writings. He has perfected the theory of the military
State, and he has acted consistently on the theory.
It is highly significant that his very first public act,
almost never mentioned by his biographers, was his
spoliation of the Prince-Bishop of Li&eacute;ge (an historical
precedent tragically suggestive at the present day).
The Prince-Bishop of Li&eacute;ge had committed the heinous
crime of resisting the impressment of his subjects
kidnapped by the recruiting sergeants of the Prussian
King. On the strength of that theory, Frederick
attacked the defenceless daughter of the Austrian
Emperor who had saved his life at Custrin. On the
strength of that theory he betrayed every one of his
allies. On the strength of that theory he committed
his most odious crime&mdash;he murdered the Polish
nation.


V.

We are told that Frederick the Great was an
incomparable political virtuoso. We are told that
he showed heroic fortitude in disaster, after Kollin
and Kunersdorff. But so did C&aelig;sar Borgia after the
sudden death of Alexander VI. We are told that he
was tolerant of all creeds. But that was only because[141]
he disbelieved all creeds, and he believed, with
Gibbon, that &#8220;all creeds are equally useful to the
statesman.&#8221; We are reminded that he was an amazing
economist, husbanding and developing the national
finances. But his finances were only the sinews of
war. We are told that he protected literature and
art, but, like religion, he found literature an instrument
useful for his political designs. We are reminded
that he was himself the servant of the State.
But in serving the State he only served his own
interests, because the State was incarnated in himself,
and in husbanding his resources he was only acting
like a miser who is adding to his hoard. We are
finally told that as the result of his life-work Frederick
succeeded in creating the most marvellous military
machine of modern times. We forget that, as is the
way with most military machines, the Prussian
machine ten years after Frederick&#8217;s death had become
a pitiful wreck in the hands of his immediate successor,
and that it required the genius of Bismarck to manufacture
another Prussian military machine to be used
once more for the enslavement of Europe.



CHAPTER VI[142]

THE APOTHEOSIS OF GOETHE


No less than three books on Goethe have been issued
in the course of the last few months, and the fact is
sufficient evidence that the cult of the Olympian
Jupiter of Weimar, which was first inaugurated eighty
years ago by Carlyle, is in no danger of dying out in
England. Professor Hume Brown has given us a
penetrating and judicious study of Goethe&#8217;s youth,
such as one had a right to expect from the eminent
Scottish historian.[17] Mr. Joseph McCabe has given
us a comprehensive survey of Goethe&#8217;s life, and an
objective and critical appreciation of his personality.[18]
Both are in profound sympathy with their subject,
but neither is a blind hero-worshipper. In Mr.
McCabe&#8217;s life we are not only introduced to the
scientist who is ever in quest of new worlds to conquer,
we are also made acquainted with the pagan
epicure ever engaged in amorous experiments! We
are not only introduced to the sublime poet and
prophet, we are also introduced to the incurable
egotist, who could only find time to visit his old
[143]mother once every ten years, whilst, as boon companion
of a petty German Prince, he always found
time for his pleasures. We are not only admitted to
contemplate the pomp and majesty of his world-wide
fame, we are also admitted to the sordid circumstances
of Goethe&#8217;s &#8220;home.&#8221; And our awe and reverence
are turned into pity. We pity the miserable husband
of a drunken and epileptic wife rescued from the
gutter; we pity even more the unhappy father of
a degraded son, who inherited all the vices of one
parent without inheriting the genius of the other.


I.

The first quality which strikes us in Goethe, and
which dazzled his contemporaries, and continues to
dazzle posterity, is his universality. He appears to
us as one of the most receptive, one of the most encyclop&aelig;dic
intellects of modern times. A scientist
and a biologist, a pioneer of the theory of evolution,
a physicist and originator of a new theory of colour,
a man of affairs, a man of the world and a courtier, a
philosopher, a lyrical poet, a tragic, comic, satiric,
epic, and didactic poet, a novelist and an historian,
he has attempted every form of literature, he has
touched upon every chord of the human soul.

It is true that, in considering this universality of
Goethe, it behoves us to make some qualifications.
His human sympathies are by no means as universal
as his intellectual sympathies. He has no love for
the common people. He has the aloofness of the
aristocrat. He has a Nietzschean contempt for
the herd. He takes little interest in the religious[144]
aspirations of mankind or in the struggles of human
freedom. The French Revolution remains to him a
sealed book, and his history of the campaign in France
is almost ludicrously disappointing.

With regard to what has been called his &#8220;intellectual
universality,&#8221; the elements which compose it
cannot be reduced to unity and harmony. It would
be difficult to co-ordinate them into a higher synthesis,
for that universality is at the same time diversity
and mutability. Goethe is essentially changeable and
elusive. In his works we find combined the antipodes
of human thought. There is little in common between
the poet of Goetz von Berlichingen and Werther on
the one hand and the poet of Tasso and Iphigenia on
the other hand. The intellect of Goethe is like a
crystal with a thousand facets reflecting all the colours
of the rainbow.

And it may well be asked, therefore, whether this
encyclop&aelig;dic diversity can aptly be called universality.
Universality must ultimately result in unity and
harmony, and it is impossible to assert that Goethe&#8217;s
mind ever achieved unity and harmony, that it was
ever controlled by one dominant thought.

At any rate, whether a defect or a quality, there
can be no doubt that this encyclop&aelig;dic diversity has
turned to the great advantage of his glory. It is precisely
because Goethe is an elusive Proteus that all
doctrines may equally claim him. Romanticists turn
with predilection to the creator of Werther or the
first &#8220;Faust.&#8221; Classicists admire the plastic beauty
of Tasso and Iphigenia. The cosmopolitan sees in
Goethe the Weltb&uuml;rger, the citizen of the world,
the incarnation of die Weltweisheit. The patriot[145]
acclaims in him the poet who has sung the myths and
legends dear to the German race. The sensuous and
voluptuous libertine is enchanted by the eroticism
of the &#8220;Roman Elegies.&#8221; The domesticated reader
is drawn by that chaste idyll, Herman and Dorothea.
The Spinozist and Pantheist are attracted by the
general tendencies of his philosophy. The Christian
is at liberty to interpret &#8220;Faust&#8221; in a sense which
is favourable to his religion. The Liberal politician
can point to the author of Goetz and Egmont. The
Conservative and Reactionary can claim all the works
of Goethe&#8217;s maturity, when the poet had become the
perfect courtier.


II.

There is a second quality which Goethe possesses
in a supreme degree, and by which he is distinguished
from his contemporaries&mdash;namely, mental sanity and
serenity. Most of his fellow-poets reveal some morbid
characteristics, are afflicted with some Weltschmerz,
with some internal spiritual malady. They live in
an atmosphere of strife and discord. The marvellous
vitality of Goethe has escaped from the contagion.
Like his fellow-poets, he passed through the crisis of
the Sturm und Drang. But it seems as if he had
only known it in order to give to his experiences
a final artistic expression. He communicated the
&#8220;Wertherian malady&#8221; to a whole generation, but he
himself emerged triumphant and unscathed. The
hurricane which wrecked so many powerful intellects
spared his own. After the Italian journey he never
ceased by example and precept to recommend
harmony and balance, and he became so completely[146]
the perfect type of intellectual and artistic sanity that
the world has forgotten the Bohemian days of Frankfurt
and Leipzig, the merry days of Weimar, the
repulsive vulgarity of his drunken mistress and wife,
the degradation of his son, and has agreed only
to contemplate the Olympian majesty of Weimar.
Whether the repose and sanity of Goethe were
unmixed virtues, or whether they were partly the
result of indifference, of impassivity or selfishness, is
another question. Certain it is that there is no other
trait in Goethe&#8217;s personality which has done more to
raise him in the esteem of posterity. He has proved
to the world that internal discord and distraction and
morbid exaltation are not the necessary appanage of
genius, and that, on the contrary, the most powerful
genius is also the most sane, the most balanced, the
most self-possessed, the most harmonious.


III.

Without going here into the purely formal and
artistic qualities of Goethe&#8217;s works, there is one fact
which, perhaps more than any other, impressed itself
on the imagination of the world, and that is the
realization of his own personality, the achievement
of his own destiny. Of all his poems, the rarest and
most perfect is the poem of his life. Hitherto no
such life had ever been allotted to a favourite of the
Muses. He seemed to have received a bountiful
abundance of all the gifts of the fairies&mdash;superb health,
comfort, and wealth, the love of an adoring mother
and sister, the loyalty of illustrious friends, the
favour of Princes, the homage of women, and the[147]
admiration of men. To him was opened every
province of human activity. He exhausted every
form of enjoyment. His life until the end was like
the unfolding of a glorious version of a happy dream.
At eighty years of age he remained the one surviving
giant of the golden age of German literature. In
his lifetime he was considered by Europe, as well as
by Germany, as the most glorious exemplar of his
race, and the city of his adoption had become a
pilgrimage attracting worshippers from all parts of
Europe. Death was merciful to him. The last act
of his life was as beautiful as the others. It was not
preceded by the gradual dissolution of his physical
and intellectual strength; rather was it like the
burning out of a flame. He passed away in an
apotheosis, and the last words uttered by the dying
poet, &#8220;Mehr Licht, mehr Licht&#8221; (More light, more
light), have become for all future generations the
final expression of his philosophy and the symbol of
his personality.

CHAPTER VII[148]

THE SERVICE OF THE CITY IN GERMANY[19]


I.

All English students interested in Germany owe a
deep debt of gratitude to the unremitting labours of
Mr. William Harbutt Dawson in the fields of Teutonic
scholarship. He is one of a gallant band of some
half-dozen publicists who, amidst universal neglect,
have done their utmost to popularize amongst us
a knowledge of German life and German people.
Mr. Dawson&#8217;s last book is certain to take rank as a
political classic. It is a lucid exposition of &#8220;Municipal
Life and Government in Germany&#8221; (Longmans
and Co., 12s. 6d. net). City administration and city
regulations are a subject which no literary art can
make very exciting, but, difficult and forbidding
though it be, it is a subject which yields in importance
and interest to no other. There is certainly no other
subject which will reveal to us more of the secrets
of German greatness.


II.

For the greatness of Germany is not to be explained
by her unwieldy army, her red-tape bureaucracy, her
impotent Reichstag, her effete Churches. Her army,
[149]Parliament, and Churches are symptoms of weakness
and not of strength. The true greatness of Germany
is largely due to a factor ignored by most writers,
ignored even by Mr. Dawson in all his previous
works&mdash;namely, the excellence of German municipal
institutions, the intensity of her civic life. We have
been too much accustomed to think of Germany only
as a despotic empire. She might be far more fittingly
described as a country of free institutions, a federation
of autonomous cities. We fondly imagine that
ours is the only country where self-government prevails.
Readers who might still entertain this prejudice
will carry away from Mr. Dawson&#8217;s book the
novel political lesson that Germany, much more than
Great Britain, deserves to be called a self-governing
nation, and that, at least in her civic government,
which, after all, affects 70 per cent. of her population,
Germany enjoys a measure of political liberty
which is absolutely unknown in our own country.


III.

The tradition of municipal freedom in Germany
is as old as German culture. It still lingers in the
haunting charm of the German cities to-day. The
Holy Roman Empire possessed only the trappings
and the shadow of power; the reality belonged to the
burghers of the towns. The St&auml;dtewesen gives its
original character to the German Middle Ages. The
Hansa towns and the Hanseatic League recall some
of the most stirring memories of German history.
The League still survives in the three independent[150]
republics of Hamburg, Bremen, and L&uuml;beck. The
dominant fact that German medieval civilization was
a civilization of free cities is driven home to the most
superficial tourist. In every corner of the German
Empire, in north and south, on the banks of the
Rhine and the Elbe, in Rothenburg and Marienburg,
in Frankfurt and Freiburg, the thousand monuments
of the past prove to us the all-important truth that
in Germany, as in Italy and in Flanders, it is the
service of the city which has made for national
greatness.


IV.

War and anarchy put an end to municipal prosperity.
Protestantism brought with it the confusion
of spiritual and temporal power, which brought with
it the despotism of the Princes, which meant the
suppression of civic liberty. The Thirty Years&#8217; War
completed the ruin of the cities. The end of the
seventeenth century put in the place of city governance
the tyranny of a hundred petty Princes. Everywhere
we see the ancient town halls crumbling into
ruin, and we see arising pretentious palaces built
on the model of the Palace of Versailles. Germany
had to go through the bitter humiliation of Jena
before she realized the necessity of reverting to her
glorious civic traditions. The statesmanship of Stein
(see Seeley&#8217;s &#8220;Life and Times of Stein&#8221;) understood
that such return was the prime condition of a German
political renaissance. By his memorable Municipal
Law of 1808 Stein restored civic liberty. He made
local self-government the corner-stone of German
internal policy. The ordinance of Stein remains to[151]
this day the organic law and Great Charter of the
German city. It has stood the test of one hundred
years of change, and even the iron despotism of the
Hohenzollern has not been able to challenge it. In
every other political institution Germany is lamentably
behind. Only in her municipal life is she in
advance of most European countries.


V.

As we hinted at the outset, the municipality has
far greater powers in Germany than in Great Britain.
It is true that the police authority is under the control
of the central power, that education inspection
is under the control of the Church, which is another
kind of spiritual police. It is true that the City
Fathers are debarred from mixing with party
politics. But within those limitations, and in the
province of economics and social welfare, municipal
powers are almost unrestricted. It is thus that
German towns have been the pioneers in school
hygiene. Every German child is under the supervision
of the school dentist and the school oculist.
It is thus that German cities have established their
public pawnshops, and have saved the poor man from
the clutches of the moneylender. It is thus that they
have initiated gratuitous legal advice for the indigent.
They have even established municipal beerhouses and
Rathhauskeller. In one word, they have launched
out in a hundred forms of civic enterprise.[152]


VI.

One of the most striking fields of municipal enterprise
is the policy of Land Purchase. The people
were encouraged to enter on this policy by the evils
of private land speculation, and by the shocking
housing conditions in some of the big cities, and
especially in Berlin, where the curse of the barrack
system still prevails.

Nearly every German city is an important landowner,
owning on an average 50 per cent. of the
municipal area.

&#8220;While the powers of English urban districts in
relation to land ownership are severely restricted by
law, German towns are free to buy real estate on
any scale whatever, without permission of any kind,
unless, indeed, the contracting of a special loan should
be necessary, in which event the assent of the City
Commissary is necessary. This assent, however,
entails no local inquiry corresponding to the inquiries
of the Local Government Board, simply because the
German States have no Local Government Board,
and no use for them; the proceeding is almost a
formality, intended to remind the communes that the
State, though devolved upon them their wide powers
of self-government, likes still to be consulted now and
then, and it is arranged expeditiously through the
post. For, strange as it may sound to English ears,
the Governments of Germany, without exception, far
from wishing to hamper the towns in their land investments,
have often urged the towns to buy as much
land as possible and not to sell&#8221; (Dawson, p. 123).[153]

&#8220;Within the present year the little town of Kalbe,
on the Saale, expended just &pound;14 a head on its 12,000
inhabitants in buying for &pound;468,000 a large estate for
the purpose of creating a number of smallholdings
and labourers&#8217; allotments. During the period 1880
to 1908 Breslau expended over one million and a half
pounds in the purchase of land within the communal
area. Berlin has an estate more than three times
greater than its administrative area. In 1910 alone
seventy-three of the large towns of Germany bought
land to the aggregate extent of 9,584 acres and to the
aggregate value of over four million pounds sterling.
Charlottenburg now owns 2,500 acres of land as yet
not built upon, with a value of over a million and a
quarter pounds, and the value of all its real estate is
about four and a half million pounds sterling. In
1886 Freiburg, in Baden, owned nearly 11,000 acres
of land with a value of &pound;925,000. In 1909 its estate
was only 2,000 acres larger, but its value was then
&pound;2,300,000.&#8221;

&#8220;Since 1891 Ulm, under the rule of a mayor convinced
of the wisdom of a progressive land policy
and strong enough to carry it out, has bought some
1,280 acres of land at different times for &pound;316,000,
while it has sold 420 acres for &pound;406,000, showing a cash
profit of &pound;900,000, apart from the addition of 860 acres
to the town estate. As a result of Ulm&#8217;s land policy,
its assets increased between 1891 and 1909 from
&pound;583,500 to &pound;1,990,000, an increase of &pound;1,407,000,
equal to &pound;25 a head of the population. Another result
is that of the larger towns of W&uuml;rtemberg only one
has a lower taxation than Ulm. It is solely owing to
its successful land policy that this enterprising town,[154]
without imposing heavy burdens on the general body
of ratepayers, has been able to undertake a programme
of social reforms which has created for it an honourable
reputation throughout Germany.&#8221;


VII.

In quite a different direction, in the encouragement
of Art and Literature, the German municipality
plays a leading part.

&#8220;The budgets of most large and many small
German towns contain an item, greater or less according
to local circumstances, which is intended
to cover &#8216;provision for the intellectual life of the town.&#8217;
This item is independent of expenditure on schools,
and, if analyzed, will be found often to include the
maintenance of or subsidies to municipal theatres,
bands, and orchestras, as well as grants to dramatic
and musical societies of a miscellaneous order. In
this provision the theatre takes an altogether dominant
position, and the fact is significant as reflecting the
great importance which in Germany is attributed to
the drama as an educational and elevating influence
in the life of the community. It may be that the
practice of subsidizing the theatre is not altogether
independent of the fact that the repertory theatre
is universal in Germany, except in the smallest
of provincial towns, with the result that a far more
intimate tie exists between the drama and the community
than is possible in the case of travelling
companies.&#8221;

&#8220;If the question be asked, Is the higher drama
encouraged by the municipal theatre? the answer[155]
must be an emphatic affirmative of the high standard
of education in Germany. Speaking generally, no
theatres in Germany maintain the drama at a higher
level than the municipal theatres in the large towns.
The lower forms of the drama will find no home here,
for public taste looks for the best that the stage can
offer, and as the demand is, so is the supply. Many
a provincial theatre of this kind presents more Shakespearean
plays in a week than the average English
theatre outside London presents in a couple of years.
A glance at the repertory of any of the municipal
theatres which have been named is enough to convince
one that an elevated aim is steadily kept in
view. For example, in a recent year the two Mannheim
municipal theatres presented 161 separate
works, including 93 dramas, 62 operas and operettas,
and 6 ballets, and of these works 442 repetitions
were given in the aggregate, making for the year
604 performances, a number of which were at popular
prices. The dramas given included fifteen by Schiller,
ten by Shakespeare, three by Goethe, three by Lessing,
five by Moli&egrave;re, four by Hans Sachs, four by Sheridan,
eleven by Grillparzer, two each by Kleist and Hebbel,
and several by Ibsen, while the operas included three
by Beethoven, three by Cherubini, six by Mozart,
three by Weber, and several by Wagner. Could an
English provincial theatre&mdash;could all English provincial
theatres together&mdash;show a record equal to
this? That plays of this kind are given is proof that
the German public looks to the municipal theatre
for the cultivation of the highest possible standard
of dramatic taste and achievement.[156]&#8221;


VIII.

The German city has managed to combine efficiency
with freedom. She has managed to establish a
strong executive and yet to safeguard the will of
the people. In France the Mayor is appointed by
the State, and he is the tool of the Ministry. In
Great Britain the City Fathers are honorary and
unpaid. In Germany they are salaried servants,
and yet elected by the people. In Great Britain
magistrates are temporary, ephemeral figure-heads.
They are not even allowed time to serve their apprenticeship.
They remain in office one, two, or at
most three years, receive a knighthood in the larger
provincial towns, and retire into private life. In
Germany the Burgomaster and Aldermen are permanent
servants, at first elected for twelve years, and
on re-election appointed for life. Their whole life
is identified with the interests of the city.

There lies the originality of German civic government,
and there lies the secret of municipal efficiency.
The German Mayor and council are experts. City
government is becoming so technical a science
that there are now schools of civic administration
established in several parts of the German Empire.
The city administrator is not a grocer or a draper
temporarily raised to office, nor are they only town
clerks and officials. They have both the confidence
of the people and the responsibility of power, and
they are given time to achieve results, to follow up
a systematic policy.[157]


IX.

The whole secret of German municipal government
is told by Mr. Dawson in a footnote of his
book:

&#8220;The chief Mayor of Duisburg is about to seek
well-earned rest after thirty-four years of work.
When in 1880 he took over the direction of the town&#8217;s
affairs, Duisburg had 34,000 inhabitants. To-day
Duisburg, with the amalgamated Ruhrort and
Meiderich, has a population of 244,000. This remarkable
development is specially due to the far-sighted
municipal policy pursued by the chief Mayor,
who made it his endeavour to attract new industries
to the State for the creation of the docks&mdash;as the
result of which Duisburg is the largest inland port
in the world&mdash;and the incorporation of Ruhrort and
Meiderich in 1905.&#8221;

This footnote illustrating the history of Duisburg
might serve equally well as an illustration for the
history of other German towns. On reading that
footnote I could not help thinking of a famous
English statesman whose recent death has closed a
stirring chapter of British history. German and
Austrian municipalities give the widest scope for
political genius and attract the ablest men. If the
same conditions had prevailed in this country, Mr.
Chamberlain would have been content to identify
himself with the prosperity of his adopted city,
as the Mayor of Duisburg identified himself with
the greatness of Duisburg; as Lueger identified
himself with the greatness of Vienna. And if[158]
Birmingham had given full scope to the genius of
Mr. Chamberlain, how different would have been the
life-story of the late statesman, and how different
would be the England in which we are living
to-day!

CHAPTER VIII[159]

THE NEGLECT OF GERMAN


There are many urgent reforms needed in our national
education; those who are best qualified to speak could
make many a startling revelation if they only dared to
speak out. And there is ample evidence that almost
every part of our educational machinery requires the
most thorough overhauling. In the words of Bacon,
&#8220;Instauratio facienda ab imis fundamentis.&#8221; But I
doubt whether there does exist any more glaring proof
of the present inefficiency of our Secondary Schools
and Universities than their scandalous attitude towards
the study of the German language and literature.

The plain and unvarnished truth is that at the beginning
of this, the twentieth century, when Germany is
the supreme political and commercial Power on the
Continent of Europe, the study of German is steadily
going back in the United Kingdom. In some parts it
is actually dying out. In many important Secondary
Schools it is being discontinued. Even in the Scottish
Universities, which pride themselves on being more
modern and more progressive than the English
Universities, there does not exist one single Chair of
German. In Oxford a Chair of German was only
established through the munificence of a patriotic
German merchant.[160]

And even when there are teachers there are very few
students. In one of the greatest British Universities,
with a constituency of 3,500 students, there has been,
for the last ten years, an average of five to six men
students. And the reluctance of young men to study
German is perfectly intelligible. The study of German
does not pay. It brings neither material rewards
nor official recognition. All the prizes, all the
scholarships and fellowships, go to other subjects,
and mainly to the classics. Let any reader of Everyman
stand up and say that I am exaggerating; I
would only be too delighted to discover that I am
wrong.

Such being the attitude of those who are primarily
responsible for our national education, can we wonder
at the attitude of the general public? Can we expect
it to take any more interest in German culture than
the educational authorities? Let those who have
any doubt or illusion on the subject make inquiries
at booksellers&#8217;, at circulating libraries and public
libraries, at London clubs. I have tried to make
such an investigation, and all those institutions have
the same sorry tale to tell. It is impossible to get
an outstanding book which appears in Germany, for
it does not pay the publisher to stock such a book.
At Mudie&#8217;s, for every hundred French books there
may be two German books. At the Royal Societies
Club, with a membership of several thousands, every
one of whom belongs to some learned society, you
may get the Revue de Deux Mondes, or the Temps,
or the Figaro, but you cannot get a German paper.
For the last twenty years I have not once seen a
copy of the Zukunft, or the Frankfurter Zeitung, or[161]
the K&ouml;lnische Zeitung, at an English private house,
at an English club, at an English bookseller&#8217;s, at an
English library.

A few months ago the most popular and most
enterprising daily paper of the kingdom published
some articles on the German elections, which were
justly rousing a great deal of attention in this country.
I was very much impressed by the cleverness of those
articles, but my admiration knew no bounds when the
author confessed that he was writing without knowing
a word of German, and that when attending political
meetings he had to make out the meaning of the
language by the gestures and facial expression of the
orators. Have we not here, my classical friends, an
exhilarating instance of the results of your monopoly?
Ab uno disce omnes.

We are constantly being told that &#8220;knowledge is
power,&#8221; and that the knowledge of a foreign language
means not only intellectual power, but commercial
and political power. Yet those in authority do not
budge an inch to get possession of such power. We
are constantly warned by political pessimists that
Germany is making gigantic strides, and that we
ought to keep a vigilant outlook. Yet we do nothing
to obtain first-hand information of the resources of
a nation of sixty-five millions, who is certainly a
formidable commercial rival, and who to-morrow may
meet us in deadly encounter.[20] On the other hand,
we are told with equal persistence by political optimists
that we ought to be on the most friendly
terms with a great kindred people from whom nothing
separates us except regrettable ignorance and superficial
[162]misunderstandings. Yet, in order to dispel
that ignorance and to remove those misunderstandings,
we do not make the first necessary step&mdash;namely,
to learn the language of the people whom
we are said to misunderstand.

It is true that Members of Parliament and journalists
are ready enough to proceed to Germany on a mission
of goodwill, and to be entertained at banquets and
international festivities. But how futile must be
those friendly demonstrations when we consider that
the enormous majority of those Parliamentarians and
journalists are unable to read a German newspaper!
And how must it strike a citizen of Hamburg or
Frankfurt when their English guests have to reply
in English to the toasts of their German hosts! And
how must a patriotic German feel when he discovers
that not five out of a hundred have taken the trouble
to master the noble language of the country whose
friendship they are seeking!

A few weeks ago I had the pleasure of attending, at
the house of a prominent political leader, a representative
gathering of politicians, diplomats, and journalists,
who were met to consider the best means of promoting
Anglo-German friendship. In answer to a
speech of mine, an eminent German publicist and
editor of an influential monthly review delivered
an eloquent address in broken French. To hear a
German address in French an audience of Germanophile
Englishmen was certainly a ludicrous situation!
But the speaker realized that it would be hopeless
to use the German language, even to an assembly
specially interested in supporting Anglo-German
friendship.[163]

How long, my classical friends, are we going to
submit to these disastrous results of your monopoly?
Quousque tandem! How long are we going to stand
this scandal of international illiteracy and ignorance,
fraught with such ominous peril for the future?
How long is this nation going to be hoodwinked by
an infinitesimal minority of reactionary dons and
obscurantist parsons, determined to force a smattering
of Greek down the throats of a reluctant youth?
How long is modern culture to be kept back under
the vain pretence of maintaining the culture of
antiquity, but in reality in response to an ignoble
dread of enlightenment and progress, and in order
to protect vested interests and to maintain political,
intellectual, and religious reaction?

CHAPTER IX[164]

MECKLENBURG, THE PARADISE OF
PRUSSIAN JUNKERTHUM


I.

The tourist who takes the express train between
Berlin and Copenhagen, one hour after he has left
the Prussian capital reaches a vast plain more than
half the size of Belgium, where barren moorlands
alternate with smiling fields, where dormant lakes
are succeeded by dark pine-forests. Few travellers
ever think of breaking their journey on this melancholy
plain, the territory of the Grand Dukes of
Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Mecklenburg-Strelitz.
They have not the remotest suspicion that these
Grand Duchies of Mecklenburg, which they cross
in such listless haste, are, from a political point
of view, one of the most fascinating countries of
Europe. Mecklenburg has for the students of comparative
politics the same sort of interest which an
Indian reserve territory, or the Mormon State of
Utah, has for the traveller in the United States, or
which a cannibal tract in the equatorial Congo forest
has for the explorer of Central Africa. For this
pleasant land of Mecklenburg-Schwerin is the last
survival of a patriarchal and feudal civilization. It[165]
is the most perfect type of the paternal Prussian type
of government, entirely unspoiled by the Parliamentary
institutions of a feeble democratic age.


II.

Here alone of all the North German States the
conditions of a past generation continue in their
pristine vigour. Although the Grand Duke is the only
descendant of Slavonic Princes in the German Empire,
and still calls himself &#8220;Prince of the Wendes,&#8221; he
is the most Teutonic of dynasts. Although Mecklenburg-Schwerin
is independent of Prussia, it is the
most Prussian and the most Junkerized of all Federal
States.

In degenerate Prussia the Kaiser has actually to
submit to the financial control of an unruly Reichstag,
and is not even allowed to spend the Imperial revenues
as any Emperor by right Divine ought to be logically
allowed to do. The Duke of Mecklenburg is far
more fortunate than William II. He has no accounts
to settle, he has not even a budget to publish. He
collects in paternal fashion the revenues of his Grand
Ducal demesnes, and no power has any right to ask any
questions. Even the &#8220;Almanack of Gotha,&#8221; which
is generally omniscient in these matters, is silent on
the revenues of His Highness. There is a public
debt of about one hundred and fifty million marks!
The public revenues are the private income of the
Grand Duke. The public debt is a private charge on
the people.

In degenerate Prussia even the Imperator-Rex
has to divide some of his authority with a meddlesome[166]
assembly, and has to delegate it to an obedient
but ridiculous bureaucracy. In the Grand Duchy
of Mecklenburg the ruler governs his subjects in
the good old patriarchal way. It is true, in the
troubled days of 1848 an unwise predecessor granted
something like a paper constitution, but that scrap
of parchment happily became a dead-letter twelve
months after it had been granted. It is also true
that there still subsists some faint image of representative
government in the two estates of the Grand
Duchy, dating as far back as 1755, but those venerable
estates of the Grand Duchy are only composed
of and only represent the Ritterschaft&mdash;i.e., six
hundred and ninety noblemen; and the Landschaft&mdash;i.e.,
fifty municipalities. Neither the peasants in
the country nor the artisans in the towns are ever
troubled to give their advice on matters concerning
the common weal. And as, in order that a Bill may
become the law of the Grand Duchy, the consent of
the two estates is required, nothing unpleasant is
ever likely to happen, and the old order, represented
by the six hundred and ninety overlords, continues
undisturbed.

In degenerate Prussia even the Junkers have to
submit to the presence of petty landowners of lowly
birth, or even to peasants of servile origin. Do not
historians remind us that even Frederick the Great
had to surrender to the claims of the Miller of Sans
Souci. In Mecklenburg-Schwerin there is no Miller
of Sans Souci to worry the Grand Duke. For no
peasant owns one single acre of land. One-half of the
territory of the Grand Duchy is owned by a few
hundred lords of the manor, and the other half[167]
realizes the Socialist ideal of the suppression of
private property and of the transfer of all private
ownership to the State. Six thousand square miles
are the absolute property of the State&mdash;that is to say,
of the Grand Duke. For never was absolute ruler
more truly entitled than the Grand Duke to appropriate
the words of Louis XIV.: &#8220;L&#8217;&eacute;tat c&#8217;est moi.&#8221;

In this paradise of Prussian Junkerthum one
might reasonably have expected the monarch and the
lords of the manor to enjoy as complete happiness as
is ever allotted to mortal man. And the peasants
and artisans could equally be expected to share in
the universal contentment. Are not the Grand
Duke and his knights as closely interested in
the welfare of their tenants as a shepherd in the
welfare of his flock? But even in a patriarchal
Grand Dukedom the spirit of modern unrest seems
to have penetrated. If German statisticians may
be trusted, the inhabitants of the Grand Duchy do
even seem to have preferred the risks and uncertainties
of living in a distant and unpaternal American
Government to the peace and quiet and security
of the Mecklenburg plains. The ungrateful subjects
of the Grand Duke have done what the Kaiser once
advised his own disloyal subjects to do; they have
shaken the dust of the Fatherland off their feet;
they have emigrated in such large numbers to the
United States of America that this paradise of
Prussian Junkerthum, with its 700,000 inhabitants,
is to-day the most thinly populated part of the
German Empire, and contains fewer industries than
any other part.

After all, to a military empire soldiers are more[168]
necessary than peasants and artisans. Already in
1815 Mecklenburg could claim the glory of having
produced the greatest Junker soldier of the age, bluff
and rough Prince Bl&uuml;cher, the victor of Waterloo.
The achievements of the Grand Ducal regiments
have fully proved that Mecklenburg-Schwerin and
Mecklenburg-Strelitz have in the present war remained
true to the glories of their military past and have
remained worthy of their feudal present, and the
august head of the Grand Ducal dynasty is just now
doing most efficient work in the Balkan States as the
super-Ambassador of his Imperial cousin.



CHAPTER X[169]

THE GERMAN RACE HERESY AND
THE WAR


I.

It is the purpose of the following article to single out
one aspect of the war which has been strangely
neglected. It is our purpose to emphasize the influence
which the obsession of one particular idea,
the German race theory, has exercised over the
German mind and the part which it has played in
bringing about the war of the nations. False ideas
have been the dragon&#8217;s teeth from which have risen
the legions of five continents. Amongst those false
ideas the most deadly, the most fatal, has been the
German heresy of race, the theory of race inequality
and race antagonism. It is in the name of that
race heresy, in the name of Germanism and Pan-Germanism,
of Slavism and Pan-Slavism, of Saxonism
and Pan-Saxonism, the war is being waged.

We read the following passage in a recent book
by Sven Hedin, the official chronicler of the German
armies:

&#8220;Here is a (German) reservist. What a tremendous
figure! What can Latins, Slavs, Celts,
Japs, Negroes, Hindus, Ghurkas, Turcos, and whatever
they are called, do against such strapping giants[170]
of the true Germanic type? His features are superbly
noble, and he seems pleased with his day&#8217;s work.
He does not regret that he has offered his life for
Germany&#8217;s just cause.&#8221;

In this odious passage we have in a few lines the
whole history and the whole philosophy of the tragedy.
We have the spirit with which the Germans have
waged the war, we have the motive for which they
have waged it, and we have the ultimate purpose
which they hope to achieve&mdash;namely, to force upon
a subjected Europe the rule of the super-race of
Treitschke and the bionda bestia of Nietzsche.

In former times, in the so-called &#8220;Dark Age,&#8221;
nations would fight for the human, rational, but
impracticable principle of orthodoxy. To-day we
are fighting for the inhuman, for the equally impracticable
and immoral principle of race antagonism.
Germans fight because through their veins courses
the red blood of the Teutons of Tacitus. They are
fighting because they are convinced that they have
the Might and the Right and the Duty of crushing
the French and the Russians, because through French
veins courses the tainted blood of the Gauls of C&aelig;sar,
and because through the veins of the Slavs courses
the white fluid of the slave and the yellow fluid of
the Tatar.


II.

It is one of the commonplaces of the economic
school that the economic motive is the main factor
which makes for peace or war, that material interests
only count, and that ideas do not matter. It is
one of the shallow illusions of the pseudo-rationalist[171]
school that the age of religious wars is passed for ever.
As a matter of fact, this war is as much a religious
war as any crusade that was ever waged. The only
difference between the religious war of to-day and
the religious wars of yesterday is that in the past
dogmas were promulgated by priests and saints in
the name of Theology. The dogmas of to-day are
promulgated in the name of Science by the high-priests
of Universities and Academies. A few
mystical Greek words, such as homousios and homoiousios,
were the watchwords of the crusades of old.
A few equally mystical Greek words, brachycephalic
and dolichocephalic, are the watchwords of the
crusades of to-day.


III.

It may seem the idle conceit of a dreamer out of
touch with reality to assert that it is principles which
mainly matter and that it is the ideal which is the
ultimate reality. It may seem a ludicrous exaggeration
to assert that a mere abstract scientific theory,
apparently so innocuous as is the German race theory,
could be held responsible for so titanic a catastrophe.
Surely there seems to be here no relation and no
proportion between cause and effect. Yet it does
not take a prolonged effort of profound thinking
to understand the portentous political significance
of the German race heresy. It is not difficult to
understand that according as we believe that history
is mainly a conflict of ideals or according as we
believe that history is mainly a conflict of material
interests, or a conflict of races, we shall consistently[172]
either believe in peace or in war as the normal condition
of humanity. Conflicts of ideas ought rationally
to make for peace. Conflicts of material interests
will frequently, although not necessarily, make for
war. Conflicts of races must inevitably and always
make for war.

If you believe in the materialistic theory that
human history is mainly made up of the inevitable
antagonism between Aryan and Semite, between Slav
and Teuton, between Celt and Anglo-Saxon, then you
must also believe that war is the permanent and
beneficial factor in human history. For the conflicts of
races for supremacy can only be solved through war.

On the other hand, if you believe in the idealistic
theory that human history is mainly a conflict of
spiritual and moral and political ideals, then peace
is the ultimate factor. For human experience and
human reason equally teach us that a conflict of
spiritual ideals cannot be solved by violence. They
can only be solved by discussion and argument, by
persuasion and conversion, by the spread of education,
by clear thinking and strenuous working, by
the diffusion of sweetness and light. Both reason
and wisdom teach us that truth and faith are like
love&mdash;they cannot be imposed by force.


IV.

Underlying the theory of race there is a first
assumption that there is such a thing as a distinct
racial type; that there are definite breeds of men,
Aryans and Semites, Celts and Teutons, just as there
are definite breeds of dogs and pigeons; that human[173]
breeds are evolved by similar selective processes;
that those distinct racial types are the main factor
in the history of nations; that those types are endowed
with specific anatomical and physiological characteristics,
and that those physiological characteristics
carry with them equally definite moral, intellectual,
and political qualities.

And there is a second assumption which is the
corollary of the first. Not only is there a separation
of races, there is also an inequality of races.
&#8220;L&#8217;In&eacute;galit&eacute; des Races humaines&#8221; is the title of
the epoch-making book of Count de Gobineau. The
&#8220;Separation of Race&#8221; is a biological and objective
fact. But to that biological fact we must add a
moral and subjective distinction. Some races are
noble, others are ignoble. Some races are born to
rule, other races are born to obey, to be &#8220;hewers of
wood and drawers of water.&#8221; The Slav is born a
slave to be controlled by the Germans. The Serbian
is born a serf to be controlled by the Austrians. The
Bohemian is an outcast. The Pole is a drunkard.
The Celt is a weakling. The Anglo-Saxon is a
mercenary. The Russian is a Tatar and a brute.


V.

The German race theory is propped up by a formidable
array of so-called scientific proofs. All the
auxiliary disciplines of biology, botany and zoology,
physiology and anatomy, are enlisted in the service
of anthropology and ethnology. The question as
to whether a particular nation is a Kultur Volk or
whether it is only a rabble of slaves depends entirely[174]
on whether the facies is square or oval, brachycephalic
or oligocephalic. It depends entirely&mdash;to
use the pedantic jargon of the anthropologist&mdash;on
the &#8220;cephalic index&#8221; of the race.

The historical sciences are called in to support the
conclusions of ethnology. It is especially philology
which is the most efficient instrument demonstrating
the existence and the superiority of a distinct race.
Just as anatomy reveals to us the structure of the
cranium, so philology reveals to us the structure of
the mind. The philologist reveals the genealogies of
words even as the anthropologist studies the genealogies
of races.

In the burning controversies which for the last
generation have divided the Tchech and Magyar
and Croatian and Roumanian races of the Austrian
Empire, it is the philologists who have acted as
umpires. In Vienna philologists like von Jagic
have all the authority and prestige of statesmen.
Similarly, in the Balkan States, Serbians and Bulgarians,
Roumanians and Greeks, find conclusive
evidence of their respective rights in the dialects of
the Macedonian populations. Such and such a
province must be allotted to the Serbians, and not
to the Bulgarians, because such and such a dialect has
more affinity to the Serbian than to the Bulgarian
language. Similarly, in the Latin elements of their
dictionary, Roumanian patriots find convincing
evidence of their Latin ancestry, and finally prove
that they are the lineal descendants of the Dacian
legions of Emperor Trajan.[21]
[175]

VI.

Those scientific arguments, biological and philological,
may satisfy the biologists and the philologists;
they certainly satisfy nobody else. All those pseudo-scientific
facts belong to the realm of fiction. Serious
thinkers have ceased to prattle about the application
of biology to ethics since Huxley delivered his
Romanes lecture on &#8220;Evolution and Ethics.&#8221; The
encroachments of scientific materialism have failed
as signally in the political sciences as they have failed
in ethics.

It is futile to compare the processes which evolve
races of man with the processes which evolve breeds
of animals. It is true that in the lower stages of
humanity the word &#8220;race&#8221; has a definite meaning.
It may be contended that there is a wide gulf between
the races at the extreme end of the human scale,
a gulf which even the enthusiastic devotion of
missionary effort does not seem able to bridge. There
is such a thing as the &#8220;blackness&#8221; of the nigger
and the &#8220;yellowness&#8221; of the Chinese and the
Japanese, although the Japanese have proved themselves[176]
capable of assimilating Western civilization,
and although the black race has produced the greatest
poet of Russia, Pouchkine, and one of the greatest
novelists of France, Alexandre Dumas. But it is an
all-important fact that as civilization advances the
word &#8220;race&#8221; entirely changes its meaning. Evolution
entirely modifies its processes. Biological factors
steadily decrease in importance. Moral and political
and intellectual factors as steadily increase in
importance.

Isolation and selection are the main conditions
required to produce a definite breed of cattle. On
the other hand, if we want to produce a highly
civilized type, it is not isolation which is the main
condition, but crossing and blending, mixture and
intercourse. As we rise in the scale of humanity
there are no fixed types. All types are equally
plastic. There are no pure types. All types are
equally mixed.

Even if we take the Jewish race, which seems to
show extraordinary fixity and stability of type, there
is not one dominant Jewish type; there are fully
fifty different Jewish types. There is hardly any
resemblance between the Jew of Tiflis and the Jew
of Tangier, between democratic Ashkenazim and the
aristocratic Sephardim. Race is not a cause, but an
effect. It is not biology which explains politics, it
is politics which dominate biology. It is not the
physical which explains the moral, it is the moral
which produces the physical. It is not the racial
type which produces a racial belief and a racial
community, it is the religion which produces the race.
It is not the Hindu caste which produces the religion,[177]
it is religion which produces the caste. Similarly,
it is the religious and political conditions which have
kept the Jew apart, and which have preserved the
characteristics of the race. Even so, religion and
persecution have kept the characteristics of the
Armenians or the Parsees and the Greek colonies
in the Levant.


VII.

A highly gifted race is invariably the outcome of
complex elements, of many cross-currents. Invariably
it is the outcome of moral, spiritual, and political
factors. It is the outcome of unity of language, of
unity of religion, of community of traditions and institutions.
It is mainly religion which keeps apart
the French and the Anglo-Saxon races in Canada,
and which divides the Celt from the Ulsterman in
Ireland. Let the religious boundary break down,
and the Irish Celt will blend with the Ulster Scot,
the French Canadian will mix with the Anglo-Saxon.
The race heresy in its modern form is the
sinister shadow projected by the biological materialism
of the early Darwinians. It is the same materialistic
conception which has triumphed in German Marxism
and in the economic interpretation of history. It is
the same conception which has triumphed in the
Realpolitik and Weltpolitik, and the elimination of
the moral factor from the activities of high policy.
The tyranny of the race dogma permeates the majority
of the German historians and publicists from the
early nineteenth century. We find it in Mommsen&#8217;s
&#8220;History of Rome.&#8221; It has found a striking expression[178]
in his famous chapter on the Celts, which
is only a veiled attack against the French, who are
assumed to be the lineal descendants of the Gauls.
The same dogma is the dominant idea of Treitschke&#8217;s
&#8220;History.&#8221; We find it in the bionda bestia of
Nietzsche. We find it in the &#8220;Foundations of the
Nineteenth Century&#8221; of Houston Stewart Chamberlain.
We find it in the works of Count de Gobineau,
who, after working unnoticed in his own country,
has been heralded as the apostle of Pan-Germanism
in the Vaterland. The race heresy has been the
leitmotiv of all political controversies in the Empire.
We find it equally in the anti-Semitic, in the anti-Russian,
in the anti-French propaganda. It has
culminated in the triple dogma of the superman,
of the super-race, and of the super-State, and this
triple dogma of the German Realpolitik has worked
for the enslavement of Europe as inevitably as the
triple dogma of the French Revolution&mdash;Libert&eacute;,
Egalit&eacute;, Fraternit&eacute;&mdash;was bound to lead to the liberation
of Europe.


VIII.

For the philosophy of race, with all the liberal
demonstrations of its votaries, is essentially and
inevitably the philosophy of reaction and the philosophy
of militarism, if it is carried to its logical
conclusion. And, unfortunately, in Germany it has
been carried to its logical conclusion. In Britain and
France thinkers have advocated the same deadly
theories. The same deadly poison of pseudo-science
has infected the body politic. But Darwin and[179]
Huxley always saved themselves by inconsistency
from the ruthless application of their doctrines. The
common sense of the community has shrunk from
extreme logic. In a country of free discussion and
of free institutions doctrines are counteracted by
other influences. Theories are tested by life. In
an autocratic country theories are supreme. The
undiluted theories of Rousseau and Robespierre were
supreme under the Reign of Terror; the theories of
Katkov and the extreme Pan-Slavists were supreme
in Russia under the reign of Alexander III. Under
a government like Prussia, where all the spiritual
forces are mobilized, where Universities, Churches,
and newspapers are subject to the State, there is
nothing to counteract the doctrinaire spirit. It is,
therefore, not to be wondered at that the heresy of
race should have become a fixed idea, a monomania, in
the German Empire. In Great Britain the theories
of the apostate Englishman Chamberlain could not
have struck deep root, notwithstanding all the
enthusiastic praise which Mr. Bernard Shaw has
given to the &#8220;Foundations.&#8221; In France the theories
of Count de Gobineau passed unnoticed. In Germany
&#8220;Gobineau Societies&#8221; have been established in order
to propagate the gospel of the French diplomat. In
Germany one hundred thousand copies of the &#8220;Foundations&#8221;
of Chamberlain, with their ponderous twelve
hundred pages compact with facts and arguments,
have been sold, have poisoned countless brains, and
have wielded enormous political influence.[180]


IX.

The first inevitable outcome of the German race
heresy has been to stimulate the belief in the
supremacy of the Teuton and to transform the
natural conceit of patriotism into an odious megalomania.
Once the Germans assumed in accordance
with the race dogma that some European races are
born to rule and others to obey, it was inevitable
that they should draw the further inference that
they of all races were the dominant race. It is true
that the belief of the Calvinist in religious predestination
may lead to a pessimistic as well as
to an optimistic conclusion. The believer in predestination
may assume that he is predestined to
eternal damnation as easily as he assumes that he
is predestined to eternal salvation. But the pseudo-scientific
mind and the materialistic mind is not so
easily addicted to humility and pessimism. The
slave morality of the Christian may lead to meekness
and charity and to all the negative virtues of a degenerate
Christianity. The master morality of the
Anti-Christ Nietzsche must lead to the ruthless assertion
of power. The belief in race predestination
can therefore only result in megalomania, and in
Germany it has certainly resulted in the most acute,
the most insane, inflation of nationalism and imperialism
recorded in modern history. Of that
megalomania the Kaiser has been, in innumerable
speeches, the eloquent and insolent spokesman.[181]


X.

Even as race heresy must result in racial megalomania,
it must result in political reaction and in
the government of caste. The principle which is
true of the nation as a whole is as true of every
section of that nation. And the pride of race in a
nation is substantially the same thing as the pride of
birth in a class. If amongst the races of man there
is one particular breed, the Teuton, which constitutes
the born aristocracy of humanity, so amongst those
Teutons there is one special caste which is the born
aristocracy of Teutonism. It is the rooted belief
in the race theory which has maintained the rule
of Junkerthum. On the race theory an exclusive
aristocratic government recruited and maintained by
artificial selection is the only logical and sensible
government, and democracy is bound to be considered
as a principle of decay. The Kings of Prussia
select their rulers on the same principle on which
King Frederick William selected his regiment of
six-foot grenadiers from the military caste.

That is why we find in Prussia the most exclusive
aristocratic government in the world. As a sop to
Southern German opinion, Bismarck was compelled
to grant universal suffrage for the Reichstag, but in
the Prussian Parliament, or &#8220;Landtag,&#8221; Bismarck,
the Junker of blood and iron, retained the good old
principle of aristocratic government. Under the
three-class voting system of the Landtag, one voter
constituting by himself the first class may have as
much political power as the twenty thousand electors[182]
constituting the third class. That is also why the
Prussian Junker retains by right of birth a monopoly
in the higher ranks of the Army, of the Diplomatic
and Civil Service. The Junker is born to greatness
even as the princely families of Germany have been
born to a monopoly of all the thrones of Europe.


XI.

As the race theory must inevitably lead to megalomania
and reaction, so it must inevitably lead to
militarism. As it is incompatible with democracy, so
it is incompatible with peace. As we pointed out at
the beginning of this analysis, if it be indeed true that
there are some races which are born to rule, it is their
duty to assert their will to power over inferior races.
If &#8220;the true Teutonic type&#8221;&mdash;to use the words of
Sven Hedin&mdash;be indeed superior to the Celt, to the
Anglo-Saxon, to the Slav, and to the Latin, he is
morally bound to assert that superiority. The Teuton
will not only achieve the victory, he will deserve it.
Die Weltgeschichte ist das Weltgericht (World history
is world judgment). History is not a conflict
between abstractions, between truth and error,
between higher and lower principles, between conflicting
ideals; it is, above all, the tragic conflict
between higher and lower races. War is necessary
and war is beneficial. War is not only the instrument,
it is also the criterion, of progress. &#8220;Might is
Right&#8221; ceases to be an immoral principle. &#8220;Might
is Right&#8221; is the ultimate formula of the most sublime
morality, for Might is but the Right of the strong to
establish the rule of the noble over the ignoble
elements of humanity.

FOOTNOTES:

[21] The Roumanian language is a composite language like English.
Even as the English vocabulary is mainly a blend of Anglo-Saxon
and Franco-Norman, so the Roumanian language is a blend of
Latin and Slavonic words. Many years ago the British and Foreign
Bible Society published a Roumanian Bible from which the majority
of the Slavonic words had been eliminated. I pointed out in
Everyman that this Roumanian translation was not Roumanian
at all. The authorities of the Bible Society indignantly protested
and asked me to withdraw. I refused to withdraw. The British
and Foreign Bible Society investigated the question, deferring to
my criticisms, and prepared and published a new revised version of
their Roumanian Bible in which the Slavonic words largely composing
the religious vocabulary of Roumania have been restored.

A SLUMP IN GERMAN THEOLOGY


I.

In the universal readjustment&mdash;or, to use the favourite
expression of Nietzsche, in the &#8220;transvaluation&#8221;&mdash;of
political and spiritual values which must follow the
war, we may confidently expect a general slump in
all German values. There will be a slump in German
education and in German erudition, in German music
and in German watering-places. There will be a
slump in that &#8220;exclusive morality&#8221; for which Lord
Haldane could not find an equivalent in the English
language, and for which, in his famous Montreal
address, he could only find an equivalent in the
German word Sittlichkeit. But, most important of
all, there will be a lamentable slump in the most
highly prized of all German values&mdash;German theology.

Germany may still retain a monopoly of toys;
Germany may still continue to supply Princes to
the vacant thrones of Europe; but it is eminently
probable that God Almighty will cease to be made
in the Vaterland.


II.

No one who has not been brought up in a
Scottish Presbyterian University atmosphere realizes[184]
the mystical prestige hitherto enjoyed by German
theology. The education of a Scottish divine was
thought incomplete, a graduate in divinity, however
brilliant and devout, could not get an important
charge, if he had not received the hallmark and
consecration of a German theological faculty. And
what was true of German Universities was equally
true of German theological books. Publishers like
Messrs. Clark, of Edinburgh, and Messrs. Williams
and Norgate, of London, made considerable fortunes
merely from their translations of German works of
divinity.

The prejudice in favour of German Universities
and against French Universities goes back to the
early days of the Reformation. Already in &#8220;Hamlet&#8221;
we find the serious young man going to Wittenberg
and the frivolous young man going to Paris in quest
of worldly amusement. That pro-German and anti-French
prejudice has continued until our own day.
In vain have I for twenty years attempted in the
Universities of Scotland to send our graduates to
French Universities. In vain did I contend that one
single year spent in the Sorbonne provided greater
intellectual stimulus than a whole decade spent in a
German University. The old Puritan feeling against
France proved too strong. Until the year 1914 the
stream of our students continued to be directed to
G&ouml;ttingen and Heidelberg, to Bonn and Berlin.
Even in our distant colonies, even in Toronto, I
found that the majority of teachers were &#8220;made in
Germany,&#8221; whilst of American Universities it is
hardly too much to say that many of them had
actually become German institutions.[185]


III.

The prejudice which sent Scottish and English
ministers of the Gospel to complete their preparation
in Germany was all the more extraordinary because
Positive Christianity had almost vanished from the
theological faculties of Protestant Germany. Even
as Holy Russia has remained on the whole the most
Christian nation in Europe, Protestant Prussia was
certainly the least Christian. It was aptly said by
Huxley of the philosophy of Comte, that Comtism
was Catholicism minus Christianity. We might say
in the same way of German theology, that it was
philosophy and metaphysics and philology minus
Christianity. Seventy-five years ago David Frederick
Strauss, who would be forgotten but for the pamphlet
of Nietzsche, wrote a ponderous treatise of a thousand
pages, translated by George Eliot, to prove that
Christ was a myth. At the end of his life he strenuously
attempted in his &#8220;Old and New Faith&#8221; to
find a substitute for Christian theology. German
Protestantism travelled the road he indicated. The
German people have ceased to believe in Christianity;
but they have come to believe in the self-styled
Anti-Christ Nietzsche. They have ceased to believe
in God; but they still believe in His self-appointed
vicegerent, the Kaiser. They have ceased to believe
in Providence; but they still believe in a Providential
German nation. They have ceased to believe in the
Holy Trinity; but they believe all the more fanatically
in the New Trinity of the Superman, the Super-race[186]
and the Super-State. And it is this new fanatical
belief which has brought about the war of the
nations.


IV.

The prejudice of our Protestant Churches in favour
of German Theological Faculties proceeded on the
assumption that German Protestantism was identical
with Anglo-Saxon Protestantism. Surely that strange
assumption does little credit to the spiritual insight
of our divines. German Protestantism has absolutely
nothing in common with Anglo-Saxon Protestantism.
For whatever may have been adduced against
British and American Nonconformity, it must be
admitted that at least Anglo-Saxon Nonconformity
was generally what it professed to be. Anglo-Saxon
Nonconformity actually did refuse to conform,
Anglo-Saxon Protestantism did actually protest.
The separation between Church and State was a
fundamental principle of Anglo-Saxon policy, and
that separation was no ideal platonic theory. Nonconformists
gave up their emoluments, they again
and again risked their lives in defence of their
principles. In defence of their principles tens of
thousands migrated to distant climes.

For that very reason Anglo-Saxon Nonconformity
has rendered inestimable service to political liberty.
German Protestantism has never rendered a single
service to political liberty, for the simple reason that
its political practice has been consistently the reverse.
So far from Lutheran Protestantism being based on
the separation of Church and State, it was based on
the confusion of spiritual and temporal power. That[187]
confusion began with the very earliest days of
Lutheranism. Lutherans are inclined to depreciate
the personality and activity of John Huss, the great
Slav reformer, because, judged from worldly standards,
John Huss seems to have been a failure. As a
matter of fact, the Slav reformer was the ideal
spiritual hero. The Teutonic reformer was in many
ways a time-server. To Luther must be traced
the principle that spiritual allegiance must follow
temporal allegiance, that the subjects must follow
the creed of their Prince. That belief was expressed
in the Protestant motto, Cujus regio illius religio,
and that motto even to this day accounts for the
bewildering religious geography of the German
Empire.

That servile attitude of the Protestant Church to
the German State has survived to this generation;
whereas the Roman Catholic Church made a brave
stand against Bismarck in the Kulturkampf, the
Lutheran Church has remained a docile State Church.
This Erastianism is illustrated by no one more
signally than by the Pontifex Maximus of Prussian
Protestantism, His Excellency Wirklicher Geheimrath
Adolf von Harnack. Harnack has earned world-wide
fame as a bold interpreter of the Scriptures, but he
has refused to countenance those ministers who were
discharged merely because they acted on his teachings.
In his exegesis, Harnack has been the most uncompromising
of critics. In his religious politics, he has
been the most tame of courtiers, the most pliable of
diplomats. He has taken infinite liberties with the
Sacred Texts. He has never taken any liberties with
the sacred majesty of the Kaiser.[188]


V.

The confusion of temporal and spiritual power in
German Protestantism brought about two great evils&mdash;servility
in politics and indifference in religion.
But it also seemed to bring one great compensating
advantage&mdash;namely, complete toleration of other
creeds. People do not fight for a creed to which they
have become indifferent. Frederick the Great gave
equal hospitality to the free-thinking Voltaire and
to the Jesuits who had been expelled from most
Catholic countries.

That compensating advantage of religious toleration
seemed to further the higher intellectual life of the
Universities, and in one sense it did. But it must
not be forgotten that neither religious toleration
nor the higher intellectual life ever extended to the
province of politics. The freedom of the Prussian
Universities was always limited by the necessities
of the State and the accidents of politics. With
regard to religion and political thought, the Prussian
State always acted on the principle implied in the
cynical epigram of Gibbon: &#8220;All religions are equally
true to the believer. They are equally false to the
unbeliever, and they are equally useful to the statesman.&#8221;
For three hundred years the Prussian statesmen
have attempted to utilize the Christian religion,
and Prussian Christian divines have in fact proved
the most serviceable of tools. Unfortunately, in the
process religion has disappeared from Prussian soil,
and with the liberating influence of the Christian
religion has vanished political liberty.



CHAPTER XII[189]

THE GERMAN ENIGMA[22]


I.

The present investigation into Franco-German
relations conducted on behalf of the Figaro is the
work of one of the ablest publicists of modern
France. It is the work of a good European who
wishes to put an end to the senseless competition
in armaments, and to the international distrust and
nervousness which are the main causes of such
armaments. The book is also the work of a good
Frenchman who realizes that no settlement can be
durable which does not safeguard the sacred rights
of the conquered peoples of Alsace-Lorraine, who are
the first victims of outraged justice. There lies the
originality of the book. It reveals the new direction
which public opinion and political thought are taking
in contemporary France. The whole question of the
relations between France and Germany is lifted to a
higher plane. We hear no more of the humiliation
of France, of her pride and dignity, of rancour and
revenge. We hear less of the balance of military
force. The main question which is raised is a question
of moral principle and of international right.
[190]

II.

The work of Monsieur Bourdon is not only a good
book; it is also a brave deed. Too long has it been
the fashion for French publicists to entrench themselves
behind Gambetta&#8217;s phrase: &#8220;N&#8217;en parler
jamais, y penser toujours!&#8221; Silence may have been
the best policy on the morrow of the catastrophe of
1870, when one single indiscretion might have set
Europe aflame. But after forty-four years, and
under entirely altered conditions, an ostrich policy of
reticence, a cowardly policy of mental reservation,
cannot be the best means of bringing about a
settlement.

Monsieur Bourdon has therefore chosen the bolder
course, which happens also to be the wiser course.
He has broken down the barrier of fear and distrust.
He has taken the first step. He has gone to Germany
in a spirit of frankness and conciliation. He has
tried to get at her thoughts and afterthoughts. He
has cross-examined the German people, and he has
cross-examined them with consummate tact and
skill. An unofficial ambassador of peace, he has
revealed all the qualities of a diplomat, and he has
added qualities which the diplomat does not often
possess&mdash;outspokenness and uprightness, a loyal
regard for truth, and that moral preoccupation and
that delicate sense of international honour which
are generally alien to the official diplomatic mind.[191]


III.

And the result of this searching inquiry is most
satisfactory. Quite apart from the value of the
opinions expressed, and of the author&#8217;s own opinion,
the inquiry in itself is an historical document of
prime importance. Here we have before us at first
hand the public opinion of Germany. Nor is it the
irresponsible opinion of anonymous scribblers, or the
opinion of party politicians; it is the deliberate,
reasoned opinion of some of the most distinguished
German readers in thought and action. Statesmen
and diplomats, captains of industry and army
captains, editors and financiers, all the professions
except the Church (a significant omission!), are represented
in this survey of German opinion. After
reading M. Bourdon&#8217;s book, no politician will henceforth
be allowed to plead as an excuse that he does
not know what official and unofficial Germany thinks,
and what she feels on the vital questions of foreign
policy.


IV.

And perhaps the readers may carry away the impression
that Germany feels more than she thinks;
that she is carried away by prejudice, by currents and
cross-currents of emotion, rather than led by general
principles and clear and sober thinking. I had asked
one of the most eminent British publicists living to
write an introduction to the English translation of
M. Bourdon&#8217;s book which is to be published next
month by Messrs. Dent. But my friend answered[192]
that he would willingly have written such an introduction
if he could have agreed with the ideas of the
French writer. Unfortunately, he did not see his way
to agree with Monsieur Bourdon. No purpose, he
argued, could be served by cross-examining German
opinion, for there was no German opinion. In vain
did Monsieur Bourdon claim to tell us what Germany
thinks; the Germans were not educated to think
politically. And there was the rub. There was no
organized public opinion, and even if there were, it
could only express itself, it could not press its demands
upon a despotic Government.


V.

I do not here examine how much truth there may
be in my friend&#8217;s contention. But one fact must
certainly strike the readers of M. Bourdon&#8217;s book.
The present position is as ominous as it is bewildering
and unintelligible.

Monsieur Bourdon has proved once more the
tremendous power of German militarism. German
militarism seems to be bred in the bone of the
Prussians, and has been inoculated into the German
people. The army is the most popular service in the
country. It provides an honourable career to tens
of thousands of young men of the middle classes
and of the aristocracy. At the same time, Monsieur
Bourdon points out that from the German point of
view it is one thing to be militarist, and another to
be warlike and bellicose. The Germans hold that
the most confirmed militarist may be a convinced
pacifist. The father of Frederick the Great, the[193]
greatest militarist of the Hohenzollern Dynasty, the
Sergeant-King, was so attached to his army that he
never employed it in active warfare, he never allowed
it to fight a single battle, for fear of losing or spoiling
so perfect an instrument.

But even granting this paradoxical thesis of the
pacifism of German militarists, the situation remains
sufficiently contradictory and distracting to the ordinary
mind. Every representative German consulted
by Monsieur Bourdon proclaims that Germany is
pacific, that she wishes for peace, and that she needs
peace for her industrial and commercial expansion.
Yet we see her making gigantic preparations for
a possible war. With a restless endeavour, and at
tremendous cost, we see her developing her warlike
resources. Every representative German insists on
making platonic professions. Yet we do not hear of
a single statesman daring to take the necessary step
or to make the necessary sacrifices. No one seems
to understand that peace demands sacrifices quite
as heroic as war. No Bismarck of peace seems to
be strong enough to-day to put an end to the senseless
waste of national resources and misdirected energies.


VI.

The &#8220;German Enigma&#8221; of Monsieur Bourdon is
mainly an objective, impartial, and impersonal study,
and the author has been careful not to obtrude his
own private views. It is only in the last chapter
that he attempts to draw the lesson and point out the
conclusion of his own inquiry. And his conclusion
is an eloquent though restrained plea for a Franco-German[194]
rapprochement, and in favour of the only
policy which will bring about that reconciliation.
France, he argues, does not want a revision of the
Treaty of Frankfurt. She does not want compensation
or revenge. French history contains a
sufficiently brilliant roll of glorious military achievements
that the French people may afford to forget
the reverses and humiliations of 1870. A French
statesman, on the eve of the Treaty of Frankfurt,
made the rhetorical statement that France would
never surrender one stone of her fortresses nor one
inch of her territory. Animated by a very different
spirit, modern French statesmen do not claim back
to-day one inch of lost territory. All that the French
people demand is that the claims of justice shall be
heard, that Alsace-Lorraine shall cease to groan
under the heel of an arbitrary despot, that Alsace-Lorraine
shall be governed according to her own
laws, that the Alsatians shall be treated as a free
people, and not as conquered subjects.


VII.

And that one sole possibly solution is also the only
simple solution. That solution would involve no
sacrifice of pride or dignity to either nation. France
would not make any surrender to Germany, and
Germany would not make any concession to France.
Both would surrender to the demands of international
justice.

And the solution of the autonomy of Alsace-Lorraine
would be in the interests of all parties
concerned, as well as of European civilization.[195]
France and Germany would be delivered from a
nightmare which for forty-four years has paralyzed
their activities. One hundred and ten millions of
the two most progressive nations of the Continent
would cease to oppose each other in every quarter of
the globe.

Alsace-Lorraine would cease to be the festering
wound on the open frontier of the two countries, but
would once more discharge her historical function
of being the connecting link between Latin and
Teutonic peoples.

And the whole of Europe would be delivered
from the crushing burden of military expenditure.
Hundreds of millions at present wasted on armaments
would be devoted to productive purposes. Commerce
and industry would receive an impetus which
in one generation would renew the face of Europe.
Reaction would collapse with the disappearance of
military predominance, and European Governments
could devote themselves whole-heartedly to the
anxious problems clamouring for a solution, and
to the momentous tasks of popular education and
social reform which are waiting to be accomplished.

CHAPTER XIII[196]

THE TRAGIC ISOLATION OF GERMANY:
AN INTERVIEW WITH A CONTINENTAL
STATESMAN


A few months ago[23] it was my good fortune to discuss
the international situation with Monsieur Emile
Ollivier, the veteran statesman, the Napoleonic Prime
Minister with the light heart whose name will ever be
identified, and identified unjustly, with a disastrous
war. A few days ago it was again my privilege to
discuss the European situation with another Continental
statesman whose name will for ever be
identified with the cause of peace. I am not at
liberty to disclose the identity of the illustrious
speaker. Suffice it to say that he is a statesman
whose every word compels attention all over the
world and imposes respect, a man of infinite wit,
of penetrating intellect, and whose commanding
personality has on more than one occasion directed
the course of world politics, and has helped to save
Europe from an impending catastrophe. For more
than an hour the speaker discussed with me, if an
almost uninterrupted monologue may be called a
discussion, the anxious problems of modern Germany.
Without reticence or afterthought, he gave me the benefit
of his mature wisdom and of a lifelong experience.


I.[197]

You ask me to give you the key of the international
situation. That key is in Germany, or rather in
Berlin. For Prussia controls Germany, and will
more and more control it in the future.

The Germans are nervous and uneasy, and that is
why they ceaselessly increase their armaments. They
are nervous because the whole European situation has
been radically changed, to their detriment. The
whole balance of power has been upset by the results
of the Balkan War. They are nervous because they
are tragically isolated. Germany has no friends, no
allies, and has therefore to defend herself on two, or
rather on three, fronts. She has to defend herself
at once against France, against Russia, and against
England.

It is true that the Triple Alliance still subsists.
But it subsists only in name. For Germany can
count neither on Italy nor on Austria. She cannot
count on Italy. For Italy is a hopeless coquette,
and she transfers her erratic affections wherever her
interest leads her. Nor can Germany count on
Austria. No longer can Austria be called the &#8220;loyal
secundant.&#8221; For Austria has ceased to be controlled
by her Teutonic population. She is at the mercy of
the Slavs, both inside and outside of her empire.
She is abandoned by Roumania, who is seeking the
support of Russia. She is detested by the Serbians,
who have the best organized army in the Balkans.
It would have been the vital interest of Austria to
win over Serbia, and it would have been so easy to[198]
win her over. An equitable treaty of commerce, the
concession of a port on the Adriatic, and Serbia
would have become the ally of Austria. Serbia was
prepared to forget the shameful policy hitherto
pursued by Austria. All that was required was
some give-and-take, some fairness.


II.

But that sense of fairness, of international equity,
is exactly what both Prussia and Austria are so
lamentably deficient in. The Austrians, like the
Prussians, may be individually most pleasant. Politically
and collectively they are consistently disagreeable.
They never seem to understand the first principle
of diplomacy&mdash;namely, that no treaty can be of any
permanent value which is only advantageous to
one side.

And then there is the utter tactlessness of the
Germans. It is partly explainable by their belief in
force. When you believe in force you do not trouble
to persuade or conciliate. It is also partly explainable
by the absence in Prussia of an old tradition
of refinement and culture. As Bismarck once said
cynically and frankly to Thiers: &#8220;Mon cher ami!
Nous autres Prussiens, nous sommes encore des
barbares&#8221; (We Prussians, we are still barbarians).

The Prussian, therefore, in diplomacy is a blunderer
and a bully. He has the art of making himself unpleasant.
And he seems to enjoy doing so. It is
significant that the Germans are the only people who
have coined a special word to express the pleasure[199]
felt by inflicting pain. The curious and expressive
German word Schadenfreude cannot be translated into
any other language.


III.

And that is why in politics the Germans fail to
make friends. They are feared by all nations.
They are respected by some. They are loved by
none.

And they fail to make friends at home quite as
lamentably as abroad. They fail to win over the
nations living under their own German laws. They
are making such inconceivable blunders as the expropriation
of the Poles and the colonization scheme
of Posen. It is a striking fact that with the single
possible exception of the Galicians&mdash;who fear Russia
even more than they detest Austria&mdash;there is not a
single non-German-speaking people either in the
German Empire or in the Austrian Empire who has
accepted the rule of the Teuton. Alsatian and
Dane, Pole and Tchech, Croatian and Roumanian&mdash;all
the subject races are equally disaffected. They
may disagree in everything, but they agree in their
opposition to Teutonic rule.

What a tragedy this German world empire of the
twentieth century! Once Germany was made up of
little cities and great Universities. To-day she is
made up of big cities and impotent Universities.
Where are the spiritual and artistic glories of the
past? The moral and intellectual influence of
Germany has reached its lowest ebb.[200]


IV.

It is this striking isolation of Germany which
compels her to arm. On the other hand, there can
be no doubt that this very isolation is making for
peace. Nobody either in Europe or Germany wants
war. Neither the Emperor nor his Ministers want
war. War is too great a risk. It is too much of a
gamble. In warfare it is always the unexpected that
happens. War may be the national industry of
Prussia. But it is the most speculative of all industries.

At the same time, whilst we are all wishing for
peace, we must ever be on our guard. With the
militarist tendencies of a bureaucratic and despotic
State, with the economic pressure of an increasing
population, one is always at the mercy of an incident.
Twenty-five years ago the Schnaebele incident brought
Europe to the verge of war. Similar frontier incidents
in this age of aeroplanes can happen any day. They
did happen yesterday. They did not lead to serious
consequences. They might lead to fatal consequences
to-morrow. They might be magnified by a sensational
Press and by bellicose partisans such as the
Pan-Germanists. The Pan-Germanists may be only
a small minority to-day, but they are noisy, and they
are just the kind of people ever looking out for just
such &#8220;unpleasant incidents.&#8221;

Yes, let us be on our guard! Let us not trust to
a false sense of security, and let us not put our trust
in politics and politicians. Politics are so petty, and
politicians so impotent. How many so-called statesmen[201]
are there to-day who have the courage of their
convictions, and who would not be carried away by
the impulses and emotions of the moment?


V.

Such were the weighty words of the European
statesman. They were uttered without animus and
without passion. They were uttered with the serene
detachment of the philosopher and of the experienced
man of the world. And they express the deliberate
opinions of a confirmed pacifist. And they express
the substantial truth.

It would be well if our German friends would
ponder and meditate those sober and sobering utterances.
It would be well if they would try and give
their own explanation of their tragic isolation and
of their universal political unpopularity. It would
be well if they in turn would ask themselves why
political Germany is left without a friend in the wide
world? As Maximilian Harden once said: &#8220;Uns
lebt kein Freund auf der weiten Welt.&#8221; Might not
the result of such sobering reflections be to induce
the Germans to turn over a new leaf? Might it not
help to precipitate the downfall of a medieval military
bureaucracy? And might it not help to falsify the
ominous prophecy of our European statesman that
Prussia will more and more control the politics of the
German Empire?

We loved the glorious Germany of the past. Let
the Germany of to-morrow make herself again as
cordially liked as she is feared to-day. But let her
understand that no nation will allow herself to be[202]
bullied into sympathy. Sympathy must be spontaneous.
In the words of one of her greatest thinkers:
&#8220;Die Liebe ist wie der Glaube, man kann sie nicht
erzwingen&#8221; (Love is like Faith. You cannot secure
it by force).

CHAPTER XIV[203]

RUSSIA AND GERMANY


I.

The complicated and contradictory relations between
Russia and Germany can be summed up very briefly.
On the one hand, there existed before the war the
closest intercourse between the Russian and the
German Courts, and that close intercourse extended
to the army, to the bureaucracy, to the Universities,
to the industrial and commercial classes. On the
other hand, the Russian and the German people are
mutually repelled. There is a temperamental antagonism
between the two nations, between the dour
disciplined Prussian and the easygoing disciplined
Russian. In the province of ideas, of art and literature,
French influence is dominant amongst the
intellectual and in the upper classes, but as literature
counts for very little, and as trade and industry, as
the bureaucracy and the Court, count for a very
great deal, and as all these social and political
forces hitherto were almost entirely controlled by
the Germans, it may be said that before the
war German influence was supreme in the Russian
Empire.[204]


II.

Until Peter the Great, the Romanov Family was
a national dynasty. It had remained national from
sheer necessity, as no European Court would have
cared to intermarry with Tatar and Barbarian
Princes. Even at the end of Peter the Great&#8217;s reign
the prestige of Russia had scarcely asserted itself in
the politics of the West. Peter the Great expressed
a keen desire to pay a visit to the Court of Louis XIV.
He was politely given to understand that his visit
would not be acceptable, even as a poor relation will
be told that his visit is not welcome to a kinsman in
exalted position. After the death of Louis, the Tsar
again asked to be received at Versailles. This time
his overtures were accepted, but even at the Court of
the Regent his visit caused the greatest embarrassment
to the masters of ceremonies. The situation
was a tragi-comic one. French etiquette could not
decide whether the Tatar Prince was to receive the
honours which belong of right only to the ruler of a
civilized people.

For the first time in modern Russian history,
Peter the Great&#8217;s daughter, Anne, married a German
Prince in 1725. With that year begins that close
dynastic alliance with the German Courts which has
lasted until our own day. Germany has been carrying
on a most thriving export trade of Princes and
Princesses with almost every European monarchy&mdash;an
export trade of which she is reaping the enormous
political advantages in the present crisis. But in
Russia alone she has obtained a monopoly of this[205]
royal export trade. All the Russian Tsars have
married German Princesses. For one hundred and
fifty years the rule suffered no exception until
Alexander II. married a daughter of the Danish
Dynasty, which itself is in reality the German Dynasty
of Oldenburg.

I need not emphasize the supreme importance of
those close family relations between the Courts of
Russia and Germany, and especially between the Courts
of Russia and Prussia. It is the peculiarity of an
autocratic government that the smallest causes are
productive of the greatest consequences, and amongst
those smaller causes none are likely to produce more
far-reaching results than the personal likes and
dislikes of the ruler and his family. In the Empire
of the Tsars the sympathies of the ruler and of
the Imperial family for a hundred and fifty years
have generally been German. Women have no less
influence in Russia than in other countries, and as
every Russian Princess has, for a hundred and fifty
years, been German in origin, German by training,
German by pride of birth, German by prejudice, the
Teutonic influences have necessarily been supreme in
the Russian Court. Nor must we forget that every
German Princess coming to Petrograd would bring
with her a numerous suite of ladies-in-waiting and
Court officials, so that the German Court colony
was automatically increasing. Indeed, it is no
mere chance that the capital, the military harbour,
and the chief Imperial residences should all have
German names&mdash;Kronstadt, Oranienbaum, Schluessenburg,
Petersburg, and Peterhof. Peterhof has
been the Russian Potsdam. Petersburg has been[206]
the outpost of Germany in the Russian Empire,
the feste Burg of Prussia until the eve of the
war.


III.

From what has been said, it is obvious that the
national Romanov Dynasty, founded in 1613 by
Michael Romanov, Patriarch of all the Russias,
ceased to be a Romanov Dynasty at the death of
Empress Elizabeth in 1761. With Peter III. it is a
German Dynasty which ascends the throne. Peter III.,
son of a Duke of Holstein-Gottorp, is a Romanov in
the proportion of one-half; Paul, son of a Princess
of Anhalt-Zerbst, in the proportion of one-fourth;
Alexander I. and Nicholas I., sons of a Princess
of W&uuml;rtemberg, in the proportion of one-eighth;
Alexander II., son of a Princess of Hohenzollern, to
the extent of one-sixteenth; Alexander III., son of a
Grand Duchess of Hesse-Darmstadt, to the extent of
one thirty-second; and the late ruler, Nicholas II.,
who married a Princess of the House of Oldenburg,
to the extent of one sixty-fourth. One sixty-fourth
of the blood of the late Tsar is Russian Romanov
blood. In the proportion of sixty-three sixty-fourths
it is the blood of Holstein, of Anhalt, of Oldenburg,
of Hesse, of W&uuml;rtemberg, of Hohenzollern, which
flows through the veins of the late Emperor of all
the Russias.


IV.

The history of Russia proves only too conclusively
that again and again the national interests of Russia
have been sacrificed to the German dynastic influences.[207]
At the end of the Seven Years&#8217; War, Frederick
the Great was at his last gasp. Prussia was on the
verge of ruin. The Russian Army had entered Berlin;
the power of the new military monarchy had been
totally broken at Kunersdorf. The death of Elizabeth
and the accession of her mad nephew, Peter III.,
retrieved a desperate situation. For the mad nephew
was a German Prince, a Duke of Holstein, and a
passionate admirer of Frederick the Great. Peter III.
was murdered in 1762. He only reigned a few
months, but he reigned sufficiently long to save
Prussia from destruction and to surrender all the
advantages secured by Russian triumphs and dearly
paid for by Russian blood.


V.

There is no more fantastic fairy-tale and there is no
more fascinating drama than the life-story of Catherine
the Great, which recently has been so brilliantly told
by Mr. Francis Gribble. A Cinderella amongst German
royalties, a pauper Princess of Anhalt-Zerbst,
Catherine became the mightiest potentate of her age.
Although the nominee of Frederick the Great, she
pursued consistently a national Russian policy. And
she had good reasons for doing so. For no throne
was less secure than the throne of the Romanovs.
She had had to remove her husband by murder for
fear of being removed herself. She continued to be
surrounded by a rabble of unscrupulous adventurers
and intriguers. Her only safety lay in becoming a
patriotic Russian, and in seeking the support of
Russian sentiment and Russian opinion. Whilst[208]
Frederick the Great surrounded himself with French
advisers, and contemptuously refused even to speak
the German language; whilst he declared to the
German scholar who presented him with a copy of
the &#8220;Nibelungen Lied&#8221; that this national German
epic was not worth a pipe of tobacco, Catherine the
Great systematically encouraged Russian literature.
Whilst Frederick the Great remained the consistent
Atheist on the throne, Catherine the Great professed
the utmost zeal for Russian Orthodoxy. All through
her reign she avoided as far as possible a conflict with
Frederick and his successor. She divided with them
the spoils of Poland, or, as Frederick the Great put
it in his edifying theological language, she partook
of the Eucharistic body of the Polish kingdom in
unholy communion with Prussia and Austria. But
Catherine saw to it that Russia secured the greater
part of the spoils.


VI.

There is a curious and uncanny similarity between
the character and the reign of Peter III. and the
character and reign of his son, Paul I. Both reigns
were brief, yet both reigns had an incalculable influence
on European affairs. Both rulers sacrificed
national interests to dynastic interests. Both rulers
were insane, and both rulers engaged in insane enterprises.
Both father and son were murdered with the
complicity or connivance of their own family. The
Russian armies, on the advent of Peter III., had
secured and achieved a dramatic victory over Prussia,
but the admiration of Peter III. for Frederick the[209]
Great prevented the Russians from reaping the fruits
of victory. Suvoroff crossed the Alps and achieved
an equally sensational victory over France, but
Paul I. was prevented from taking advantage of his
victories by his admiration for Napoleon.


VII.

The reign of Alexander I. once more strikingly
illustrates the enormous part which subterranean
German influences have played in the foreign policy
of Russia. After the costly victories of Eylau
and Friedland, Napoleon I. had concluded with
Alexander I. the Peace of Tilsit. The treaty was
fatal to Europe, for it divided the Continent practically
between the Russian and French Empires. But it
was highly advantageous to Russia, and enormously
added to Russian power and Russian prestige.

It was certainly in Russia&#8217;s interest to maintain
the Alliance. It was broken largely through one of
those small dynastic incidents which are of such vast
importance under an absolute despotism. One of
Napoleon&#8217;s main objects was to establish a Napoleonic
Dynasty and to be adopted by marriage into one of
the ruling families of Europe. The Corsican parvenu
passionately desired a matrimonial alliance with the
House of Romanov, and repeatedly applied for the
hand of one of Alexander&#8217;s sisters; the dowager
Tsarina, Alexander&#8217;s mother, a daughter of the King
of W&uuml;rtemberg, as persistently refused. She had all
the pride of birth of a German Princess, and all the
hatred of a reactionary against the armed soldier of[210]
the Revolution. Foiled at the Court of Petersburg,
Napoleon was more successful at the Court of Vienna.
A few months after Napoleon&#8217;s last overtures had been
rejected by Russia, the Habsburgs, who, after the
Bourbons, were the most august, the most ancient
dynasty of Europe, eagerly accepted what the
Romanovs had refused. The war of 1812 with
Russia was the result of that pro-German policy of
the Russian Court.


VIII.

During the reigns of Nicholas I. and Alexander II.
the German-Austrian influence reached its zenith at
the Court of Petersburg. Nicholas I. was the brother-in-law
of the Prussian Hohenzollern. An able and
an honest man in his private relations, he was in
his political capacity a Prussian martinet, as even
Treitschke is compelled to admit, and he organized
his Empire on the strictest Frederician principles.
The Court, the Army, and the bureaucracy were
Prussianized as they had never been before. A
German bureaucrat, Nesselrode, who could not even
speak the Russian language, for forty years controlled
as Foreign Minister the policy of the Russian Empire.
Even as his grandfather, Peter III., even as his
brother, Alexander I., had saved Prussia from destruction,
so Nicholas I. saved Austria from a similar
fate. Francis Joseph had ascended a throne shaken
to its foundations. Hungary was in open rebellion.
The young Austrian Emperor appealed to Russia
for help. Nicholas I. sent an army to quell the revolution,
and established his cousin on the Hungarian[211]
throne. It is unnecessary to add that Francis Joseph
was as loyal and as grateful to Russia as Frederick
the Great had been!

Alexander I. had refused to accept Napoleon I. as
a brother-in-law. Even so did Nicholas I. refuse to
recognize Napoleon III. as Emperor of the French.
It was a gratuitous insult inspired by Prussia; it was
opposed to Russian interests, and it was one of the
main causes of the Crimean War.


IX.

Under Alexander II. the alliance of the three reactionary
empires of Central Europe was welded even
more firmly than under his predecessor. Bismarck,
during his tenure of the Prussian Embassy at Petersburg,
was the chosen favourite of the Russian Court,
and if he had chosen could have become a Minister
of the Tsar. An understanding with Russia became
the chief dogma of his political creed, and it remained
so until the end. It was Bismarck&#8217;s adherence to
the Russian-Prussian Alliance which was one of the
causes of his dismissal.

Alexander II. did nothing to guard against the
German peril. He might have been the umpire of
Central Europe, as Alexander I. had been fifty years
before. He demanded no compensation for the
enormous accession of power and territory which
Germany had received through the victorious wars of
1863, 1866, and 1870. He insisted on no guarantees.
When, after Sedan, Thiers came to St. Petersburg to
obtain the intervention of the Russian Empire, he
was dismissed with empty words. One year after[212]
Thiers&#8217;s fruitless journey, Emperor William paid an
official visit to his nephew Alexander II., and the
Tsar once more proclaimed the indissoluble solidarity
of Russia with Germany. Until the end of his reign
the German-Austrian-Russian Alliance, the famous
dynastic Alliance of the Three Emperors, remained
the keystone of European policy and the mainstay
of Russian reaction.


X.

The influence of Germany at the Russian Court was
strengthened by the influence of Germany on the
Russian bureaucracy. An agricultural community
without a middle class, Russia has had to recruit her
Civil Services almost entirely from the outside and
mainly from Germany, and more especially from the
German Baltic provinces of Esthonia, Livonia, and
Courland. Teutonic barons from those Baltic
provinces have filled the higher ranks of the Diplomatic
Service and of the Civil Service for a hundred
and fifty years. The Russian Tsars found the
German barons far more serviceable tools than the
Russian boiars. In a previous age one Emperor
after another had been removed by a rebellious
aristocracy. The highest nobles in the land had been
implicated in the Decabrist conspiracy at the end of
Alexander I.&#8217;s reign. Even under Alexander II.
there were always a few members of the nobility to
be found as accomplices in the revolutionary plots.
But there never was one single German from the
Baltic provinces implicated in a conspiracy against
reaction. It is easy to understand, therefore, why a[213]
Russian autocrat should have preferred the services
of the German Baltic barons. The Russian nobleman
is casual, lavish, a bad economist, easygoing, generous,
and he is corrupt because easygoing and generous.
He is also much more independent. The Junker is
punctual, precise, disciplined, generally poor, always
ambitious. He is also tolerably honest. He is the
ideal bureaucrat.


XI.

German influence has been no less dominant in
the Russian academies and in scientific institutions.
The Academy of Sciences of St. Petersburg was
organized on the pattern of the Academy of Berlin.
It was an official institution with high privileges, and
it remained consistently German. Until recently its
proceedings were published in the German language,
and German scientists were invariably preferred
rather than Russian scientists. Mendelieff, one of
the most creative scientific minds of his generation,
was a member of every European academy except
the Academy of Petersburg.

The Germans have been an even greater power in
the Russian Universities. They took full advantage
of the prestige which German science had acquired in
Europe, and they largely filled the ranks of the liberal
professions. German doctors, German veterinary
surgeons, German Feldschers, German foresters,
German engineers, were to be found in every part of
the Empire. A casual reading of the Post Office
directories of Moscow, or Petersburg, or Kiev, provides
a most instructive commentary on the extent of the
German domination.[214]


XII.

Securely entrenched in the Russian Court, in the
Army, in the bureaucracy, in the Universities, in the
Diplomatic Service, the Germans secured a no less
commanding influence in trade and industry. As
we have already pointed out, Russia, until recent
years, had remained an agricultural country without
a middle class. The trade remained almost entirely
in foreign hands. Already in the Middle Ages
Russian cities, like Novgorod, were affiliated to the
German Hanseatic League. In the sixteenth century
adventurous English explorers and traders, whose
exploits are amongst the most thrilling of Hakluyt&#8217;s
voyages, tried to oust their German competitors, but
they utterly failed. The Russians themselves are
excellent traders, and the merchant guilds of Moscow
have been for centuries a powerful commercial
organization. Even to-day you will meet in Moscow
unassuming Russian merchants leading the simplest
of lives and possessed of enormous wealth. But the
Russian merchant is generally conservative, un-enterprising,
a bad linguist, and servilely attached
to ancient usages. He is scarcely a match for the
foreigner. In recent years British and Belgian
traders as well as Jews and Armenians have shared
in the enormous trade of the Russian Empire, but
the Germans have secured the lion&#8217;s share.

And what is true of Russian trade is equally true
of Russian industry. The liberal economic policy of
Witte has created in one generation powerful industrial
centres in Central Russia, and especially in[215]
Poland. Here, again, the Germans have benefited
more than all their competitors together. Lodz, the
&#8220;Manchester of Russian Poland,&#8221; has ceased to be
either Polish or Russian, and has become a German
manufacturing town. Caprivi, Bismarck&#8217;s successor,
negotiated with the Russian Government a treaty
of commerce which gave enormous advantages to
German industry, and if the German Government
had continued to show the wisdom of Bismarck and
Caprivi, Germany would certainly have profited more
than any other country by the commercial expansion
of the Russian Empire.


XIII.

It might have been expected that a German
influence so absolutely supreme in every sphere of
society, in every walk of life, should have extended
to the lower classes. But the common people were
never affected by German methods and remained
untainted by the German spirit. To the Russian
moujik, the German remained the Niemets, the
mute, the alien enemy. The Russian peasant, with
his simple ways and his child-like faith, a mystic
and an idealist, has an instinctive antipathy to
the modern Prussian, who is an implacable realist,
selfish, calculating, and aggressive. The persistence
with which the Russian people have resisted and
escaped Prussian influence is not the least convincing
proof of the soundness of the Slav character.[216]


XIV.

We have seen German influence supreme in the
province of the practical, the tangible, the useful.
It is all the more remarkable that it should be insignificant
in the sphere of the ideal and of the
beautiful. In Art and Literature the influence of
Germany has been purely superficial, although the
beautiful Russian language has often been spoiled
by the influence of a cumbrous German syntax.
With the exception of Nietzsche, no German writer
has left his mark on Russian literature. The literary
influence of Great Britain has been much more
extensive, and has grown enormously during the
last generation. But it is the literature of France
which has been the dominant factor in the
literary life of modern Russia. The fascination of
French culture has been as old as Russian culture.
Catherine II. was the friend of Diderot and Voltaire,
and herself translated French masterpieces into
Russian. The French language has been the language
of diplomacy and society. Readers of &#8220;War and
Peace&#8221; will remember how the noblemen of the
Petersburg salons denounced the French usurper in
the language of Voltaire.


XV.

We have sufficiently proved that Germany has
been a formidable factor in the whole past history
of the Russian Empire. We may hope that after
the war German influence will be a thing of the past.[217]
After the war it is not German political ideas and
German institutions, but French and British ideas
and institutions which will mould the destinies of
the Russian Empire. The elective affinities between
the Russian democracy and the French and British
democracies will assert themselves and will eliminate
the mischievous and reactionary influence of Germany.

We have seen how entirely German power has been
artificial and imposed from above, how it has been
the outcome of the dynastic connection. But in the
meantime the German influence supreme before the
war still subsists and still constitutes a danger which
it would be extremely unwise and unstatesmanlike to
ignore or to under-rate. We must therefore guard
ourselves, so that when the day of settlement comes
the subtle and subterranean German forces shall
not make themselves felt, and that the Teutonic
Monarchies shall be frustrated in their supreme
effort to retain a power which has been so fatal to
the liberties of Europe and to the free development
of the Russian people.



CHAPTER XV[218]

THE PEACEMAKER OF GERMANY: PRINCE
BERNHARD VON B&Uuml;LOW


I.

In the year of grace 1878, after the great Turkish-Russian
war, a young and unknown Prussian diplomat
of twenty-nine years of age called Bernhard von
B&uuml;low found himself, as assistant to his father, the
Foreign Secretary of the German Empire, suddenly
summoned to co-operate in the making of a new
Europe. In the same year, on the same arena, an
equally unknown young Scotch politician called
Arthur James Balfour, born in the same year, 1849,
also found himself, as assistant to his uncle, Lord
Salisbury, Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom,
unexpectedly chosen to play the identical part of an
international peacemaker. And now, after a lapse
of thirty-eight years, the two erstwhile Secretaries
of the Congress of Berlin, to-day the only surviving
statesmen of that momentous crisis, Prince von
B&uuml;low and Mr. Arthur James Balfour, are about to
meet in another European Congress, and be called
upon once more to recast the map of the world.
But this time the Scotsman and the German will meet
no more as Allies working out a common policy.[219]
They will meet as the leading champions of hostile
and irreconcilable world policies, united only in a
joint endeavour to undo the evil work of Bismarck
and Beaconsfield which claimed to bring to Europe
&#8220;peace with honour,&#8221; and which ultimately brought
Europe nothing but war with dishonour.


II.

Prince von B&uuml;low&#8217;s whole career has been one
steady and rapid ascent to high office and exalted
honour. Before his fall he had earned the well-deserved
nickname of &#8220;Bernhard the Lucky.&#8221; He
seemed to have found in his cradle all the gifts of the
fairies. His most striking characteristic is an amazing
and totally un-German versatility and resourcefulness.
As a soldier he volunteered in the Franco-German
War, and retired from service as a Prussian Lieutenant.
As a diplomat he has occupied responsible
positions in every capital of Europe except London,
and the exception, by the way, is probably the reason
why he has always been less familiar with the English
mind than with the Continental mind. An unrivalled
Parliamentary tactician as well as a persuasive
Parliamentary orator, he managed with even more
than the skill of Mr. Asquith or Mr. Balfour the
most unmanageable representative assembly of the
Continent, and for twelve years he played off one
against the other the ten or more parties of the
Reichstag. As Fourth Chancellor of the New German
Empire he has been associated with all the leading
measures of the &#8220;new course,&#8221; and he succeeded for
ten years in retaining the confidence and affectionate[220]
regard of the most fickle and most despotic of masters.
A man of the world and a patron of learning and art,
he has enlisted all the graces and amenities of social
life in the service of his ambition.


III.

Like most of the men who have built up the Prussian
power; like Stein, who came from Nassau; like Moltke,
who came from Denmark; like Treitschke, who came
from Saxony, Prince von B&uuml;low is not a Prussian.
Like Bl&uuml;cher, his family originates from the Grand
Duchy of Mecklenburg, that strange paradise of a
medieval and feudal Junkerthum. But, like most
of the naturalized servants of the Hohenzollern, von
B&uuml;low proved even more Prussian than any native
of Pomerania or Brandenburg. The son of one of
Bismarck&#8217;s trusted lieutenants, he always remained
a loyal pupil of the Iron Chancellor. It is significant
that the first visit which B&uuml;low paid on his accession
to power was a visit to the fallen statesman. He was
brought up on Bismarckian traditions and ideals.
He is not a creative genius like the hermit of Friedrichsruhe.
He has been accused of being a trimmer,
but he was a trimmer like the great Lord Burleigh,
always keeping in mind the final goal to be reached.
He had to work with different materials and under
conditions entirely different from those which prevailed
under Bismarck. He had to embark on a
Weltpolitik, whereas Bismarck was content with a
Continental policy. He had to initiate the colonial
and naval policy of William, while Bismarck systematically
kept clear of colonial ventures. But as far[221]
as circumstances permitted, the &#8220;new course&#8221; of
B&uuml;low was but the continuation of the old course of
Bismarck. Like Bismarck, he fought the Socialists.
Like Bismarck, he in turn fought and conciliated the
Clericals. Like Bismarck, he enforced in Poland the
inexorable policy of expropriation and appropriation.
Like Bismarck, he remained true to the Austrian
alliance. Like Bismarck, he tried to work in close
co-operation with Russia, and tried to build up again
the reactionary alliance of the three Central Empires.
And in these many difficult tasks, which had become
much more difficult even than in the &#8217;seventies or
&#8217;eighties, B&uuml;low was as little hampered as his predecessor
by any moral principles or scruples. He
proved even more Machiavellian than his predecessor,
adhering as steadfastly to the same implacable
realism.


IV.

But, if Prince von B&uuml;low has revealed the same aims
and is imbued with the same political philosophy
as Bismarck, he has tried to attain his end by very
different means. He has none of the cynical sincerity
of his master. Bismarck carried into diplomacy the
directness and brutality of the soldier. B&uuml;low introduced
into politics the tortuous practices of Italy. He
reminds one of Cavour much more than of the master-builder
of German unity. Whilst Bismarck won his
spurs in the embassies of Germany and Russia, B&uuml;low
received his main training as Ambassador in Latin
countries. He served for five years in Paris. In
Bucharest he imbibed the Byzantine influences of[222]
the East. He spent six years in the Eternal City,
which for three thousand years has been the centre of
statecraft, and which even to-day remains the best
training-school of diplomacy. His marriage with
an Italian Princess is another indication of the
natural affinities of his temperament, and an additional
proof that he constitutionally preferred the subtle
methods of Rome to the more brutal methods of
Brandenburg. Bismarck was always using threats
which he had no intention of carrying out. B&uuml;low
is equally fond of using promises which he is as little
disposed to fulfil. Bismarck was always showing
the mailed fist. B&uuml;low prefers to show the velvet
glove. Bismarck wielded the sword of the berserker.
B&uuml;low prefers the rapier of the fencer. Bismarck
was stern, irascible, uncontrolled, titanic, and his
whole career was one long and hard struggle against
bitter enemies. B&uuml;low was ever amiable, courteous,
smiling, suave, patient, elusive. He managed equally
to conciliate the Kaiser and Bismarck, Herr Harden
and the K&ouml;lnische Volkszeitung, the Catholics and
the Jews, the industrials and the agrarians. When
the hour of disfavour came, Bismarck retired with his
mastiffs among the pine-woods of Lauenburg, nursing
his rancour and revenge. B&uuml;low retired with quiet
and graceful dignity among the statues and the
flowers of the Villa Malta.


V.

In no other aspect of his versatile career did Prince
von B&uuml;low show more resourcefulness than in his
skilful handling of the Press. He was the first[223]
German statesman who knew how to discipline and
to exploit public opinion in the interests of Imperial
policy. It is true that already Bismarck had made
frequent use of the Press as an instrument of government,
as is abundantly shown by his close association
with Lothar Bucher, with his famulus Moritz Busch,
and with Maximilian Harden. But Bismarck, whilst
using the journalists, profoundly despised them,
with the result that &#8220;Bismarck&#8217;s Reptile Press&#8221;
became a byword in Europe. Under B&uuml;low&#8217;s r&eacute;gime
the humble pressman rose to influence and affluence
and basked in Ministerial favour. With the assistance
of Mr. Hammann, Prince von B&uuml;low made the
Berlin Press Bureau a sinister power in Europe as
well as in Germany; for the Chancellor was as anxious
to conciliate the foreign journalist as the German.
M. Huret sang his praises in the Figaro. Even the
arch-Germanophobe Monsieur Andr&eacute; Tardieu was
coaxed into writing a whole volume of panegyric on
the irresistible Chancellor. Before the caprice of
his Imperial master sent him into premature retirement,
B&uuml;low had succeeded in marshalling all the
intellectual forces of the German Empire. Whilst
Bismarck had frittered away his energies quarrelling
with von Virchow, with Windhorst, and with the
professors of the National Liberal party, B&uuml;low had
managed to make the shining luminaries of the
Universities, the Harnacks, the Schmollers, and the
Dernburgs, into the most enthusiastic advocates
of his policy.[224]


VI.

There are few more bewildering subjects to the
student of politics than the many concatenations of
events which brought about the present world
catastrophe. If that fateful interview had not been
published in the Daily Telegraph, there would have
been no political hurricane in Germany. If there
had been no hurricane, Prince von B&uuml;low would not
have fallen from power. If Prince von B&uuml;low had
not fallen from power, there would probably have
been no world war. It is certain that B&uuml;low&#8217;s retirement
from office in 1909 was a disaster to the German
Empire. It is equally certain that his return to
office in 1914 and his peace mission to Italy was an
ominous danger to Europe. And it is also certain
that he will be even more dangerous to Europe in the
eventful days to come when he will be called back to
office, and be once more the leader and spokesman of
German policy. In the future Congress which will
liquidate the world war B&uuml;low will be the greatest
asset of the enemy. In the Congress of Berlin
Bismarck, towering like a giant, dictated his policy
to subservient Europe. The day of German hegemony
is past, and no German plenipotentiary will be able
again to impose his will by the same methods. But
the resources of diplomacy will be all the more
necessary to the German Empire in the future settlement,
and of the art of diplomacy B&uuml;low is perhaps
the greatest master that the world has seen since
the days of Talleyrand. It is highly doubtful whether
there is any statesman amongst the Allies who[225]
possesses to the same extent those special characteristics
which will win victory in the international
arena. If high moral ideals and perfect political
integrity were the qualities most valuable to the
diplomatist, Viscount Grey and Mr. Balfour would
be more than a match for Prince von B&uuml;low; but if
an intimate knowledge of the European chess-board
and of the psychology of European politics, if infinite
wit, if nimbleness and ingenuity, are the qualities
which are likely to decide the issue, Prince von B&uuml;low
will prove indeed a formidable opponent. It is
almost inevitable that the European Powers shall
enter the future Congress with different aims and with
divergent policies. And one needs be no prophet to
predict that it will be B&uuml;low&#8217;s object to play off one
Power against another; even as for twenty years he
played off one party against another in the Reichstag,
so he will play off Serbia against Italy, and Italy
against France, and Russia against England. In
those unavoidable conflicting interests of the belligerent
Powers B&uuml;low will seek his opportunity.
It will be for the Allies to foresee and to forestall
the danger. Let the Allies enter the Congress with
a clearly defined and settled policy. Let them compose
their differences before they meet their opponents.
Then, but only then, will there be no scope for the
uncanny virtuosity of Prince von B&uuml;low. Only on
those terms will Viscount Grey and Jules Cambon
and Sasonov defeat the man&#339;uvres of the Italianized
Prussian Machiavelli and frustrate the hopes of
&#8220;Bernhard the Lucky.&#8221;



CHAPTER XVI[226]

THE SILENCE OF HERR VON BETHMANN-HOLLWEG


I.

Herr von Bethmann-Hollweg is to-day the most
tragic figure amongst the statesmen of Europe. For
three years he has borne a crushing burden, a burden
which even Bismarck, the man of blood, was unable
to bear in the piping days of peace; a burden from
which the Iron Chancellor had to seek periodical
liberation amidst the heather and the pine-forests
of his native Brandenburg. As Prime Minister of
Prussia, as Chancellor of the German Empire, as
Foreign Secretary of the Teutonic Alliance, he has
to keep a firm grip of all the threads, both of internal
and of external policy. Distracted between Catholics
and Protestants, between agrarians and industrials,
between Germany and Austria, he has been made responsible
for all the blunders of his subordinates. A
rich man, and the scion of an historic house, he has
led the life of a galley-slave; an honest man, he has
been doomed to perpetual prevarication; a humane
man, he has had to condone every atrocity; an independent
man, he must cringe before his master; a
peaceful man, he must submit to the continuation[227]
of insensate slaughter; a highly gifted intellectual,
he has had to pursue a policy of insane stupidity.
Twenty-five years ago a professor of the University
of Munich, Dr. Quidde, compared the Kaiser to
Caligula. The analogy between William and Caligula
or Nero points to another analogy, that between
Herr von Bethmann-Hollweg and Seneca, the ill-fated
counsellor of the C&aelig;sars. Read in the Annals
of Tacitus the speech of Seneca to Nero, and you
will perhaps understand the position of Herr von
Bethmann-Hollweg in the Imperial Palace of Potsdam.


II.

The internal political crisis in Germany, which
started at the beginning of last autumn, has come to
a head because the Chancellor will not speak out.
There was a time when political crises in Germany
were due, not to the silence of the German rulers,
but to their utterances and indiscretions. In recent
months the Kaiser, the man of the three hundred
uniforms and of the three thousand speeches, has
committed no such indiscretions as marked his reign
from his ascent to the throne; he has been almost
as reticent as his unhappy father, who did not speak
because he had cancer in the throat. And now the
silver-tongued von Bethmann-Hollweg has also discovered
the political virtue of silence. The people
have been loudly clamouring for a few words of
comfort, but above the thunder of the distant guns
we only hear the scribblers of a servile Press, who are
beating the air with their croakings.[228]


III.

Why this ominous, obstinate, sphinx-like silence
of the Chancellor, more pregnant with meaning than
the most eloquent speeches? It would be so easy
for so resourceful a man to utter a few oracular
sentences, a few ambiguous phrases, a few patriotic
trumpet-calls. Was not the last great speech which
he delivered in the Reichstag covered with frantic
applause? But the days are past for ambiguous
utterances, however patriotic, however oracular.
The Chancellor knows that any clear, outspoken
utterance on the peace aims of the German Government
would seal the doom of the Government; he
knows that any statement of terms would reveal the
glaring discrepancy between those terms and the
solemn promises so often made to the German people.
The people still passionately believe in the promises
and assurance of an early and final victory. Only
such a belief is still sustaining the drooping spirits of
the nation, only such an assurance enables them to
submit to the starvation of their women and children,
to their tragic isolation in a hostile world, to the
appalling sacrifices on the battlefield.


IV.

And now the conspiracy of lies and the conspiracy
of silence is about to be exposed. The inexorable
truth must be proclaimed. The German present is
dark, but the future is desperate. The U-boat
campaign has failed, the hope of a separate peace[229]
with Russia has vanished, the menace of America is
drawing near. Greater exertions and more appalling
sacrifices are needed, and yet all the motives for further
sacrifices have vanished. The rulers were fighting for
conquest and plunder. But it is now obvious that
there can be no conquest nor plunder. The German
people were misled into the belief that they were
struggling in self-defence against the &#8220;Slav peril,&#8221;
but since the Ides of March in Petrograd the Russian
bugbear has disappeared. They were misled into
the belief that they were struggling for liberty.
But the Germans are now the only people still deprived
of political liberty. Even the much-despised
Slav has ceased to be a slave. The only slaves in
Europe to-day are the subjects of the Hohenzollern.


V.

This German war has been described as a tragedy
of Prussian craft and graft, and the Teuton rulers
have been denounced rightly for their cruelty and
brutality. But posterity would be more inclined to
see in this war a tragedy of German virtue. For the
virtues of the German have been more terrible than
his vices. For this catastrophe has been possible,
not because the German people are so wicked, but
because they have been so good, because they have
practised too well the &#8220;three&#8221; theological virtues
of blind faith, passive obedience, and inexhaustible
patience; because they have been so pathetically
loyal to their misrulers; because they have shown the
sentimentality of a woman and the credulity of a
child. The German Michel has been the political[230]
Peter Pan of Europe, the boy that won&#8217;t grow up.
He has been the boy that has been let loose and has
lit the match to the powder magazine. He has been
the incurable romanticist who has continued to believe
in fairy-tales in a world of stern realities. And now
this child-like faith in fairy-tales has been dispelled
by disaster. The vision of a holy German Empire,
of the pomp and circumstance of war, its glory and
glamour, is shattered. The spell is broken. The
German Michel is awakening from his dreams.
Walhalla is shaken to its foundation. Tor is ready
with his hammer. Revolution is knocking at the
door!



CHAPTER XVII[231]

THE COMING REVOLUTION IN GERMANY


I.

Both French and British publicists have remained
strangely silent and reticent on the problem and
prospects of a revolution in Germany. It may be
that they are afraid to conjure up the ghost of
political rebellion, lest that ghost might cause havoc
in other countries than Germany. It may also be
that they are unwilling to tackle a very complex and
delicate question. Yet the more we consider the
problem, the more central, the more vital it will
appear. German policy, German diplomacy, German
strategy, are now entirely dominated by the dread
of a social upheaval. Measures which might seem
to be dictated solely by military considerations are
in reality imposed by the necessity of deceiving and
distracting public opinion and of striking the popular
imagination.

And this obsession of an impending revolution is
fully justified. To the outside view the war may seem
above all a conflict of nations, involving a reconstruction
of the map of Europe, raising international
issues and resulting in a new international order.
But in reality the conflict is concerned with national[232]
and internal issues, and it must result in a new
national order. If this war has not been fought in
vain, if we are to achieve the objects for which we
entered it, if we are ultimately to crush German
militarism, which is only a vague and confusing
synonym for German reaction, then it inexorably
follows that the war must end in a German revolution.
The road to peace must indeed pass through Berlin,
but that Berlin will have ceased to be the Berlin of
the Junkers&mdash;it must be the insurrectionary Berlin
of 1848. Just as there can be no real war of attrition
in the struggle between Germany and Europe, so
there can be no war of attrition in the struggle
between the German people and despotism. As there
could be no compromise or surrender of principles
before, there can be no compromise and no surrender
after. On the conclusion of peace, it must come to
a final trial of strength between the rulers and their
subjects, between the masses and the classes. The
issues must be fought out in a decisive battle. Even
though we achieve a crushing military victory,
militarism would not be crushed if the Hohenzollern
were still able to command the allegiance of a still
patient and passive German people: just as Napoleonic
militarism was not crushed at Waterloo and revived
in 1849, because Napoleon still retained the allegiance
of the French people. It is inconceivable that the
German reactionaries will abdicate of their own free
will. It is equally inconceivable that the reaction will
develop slowly and gradually into a free democratic
government, as von Bethmann-Hollweg would make
us believe in the historic speech of February 27. No
doubt this war has hastened on the day of retribution.[233]
And the pathos of the war lies in this, that it has been
a vicarious sacrifice, and that millions of Frenchmen
and Britons have died to prepare the liberation of
a nation of slaves. But ultimately it is the German
people themselves who must work out their own salvation.
They will have to turn against their oppressors some
of that combativeness, of that fanaticism, of that
idealism, which hitherto they have only directed
against their European brethren.


II.

I stated at the outset that publicists have maintained
a conspiracy of silence on the coming German
revolution, because they were afraid to conjure up a
sinister spectre, and because they are repelled by
a difficult and delicate subject. But there may be
another and a more plausible reason for their silence&mdash;namely,
that most people simply cannot believe in
the very possibility of a German revolution. And
if you press them to state their definite reasons for
such a belief, you will probably find that all the
arguments given can ultimately be brought under the
four following headings:

1. Militarism and reaction are too deeply rooted
in Germany. The reactionary forces are far too
strong to leave any chance to a successful revolution.

2. A revolution is impossible under modern conditions
of warfare. A few machine-guns, a few crack
regiments of the Kaiser&#8217;s bodyguard, would at once
drench the rebellion in rivers of blood.

3. The Social Democrats, the so-called &#8220;revolutionary[234]
party,&#8221; have themselves repudiated revolutionary
methods.

4. The German temperament has not the initiative,
the resilience, which are the prime conditions of a
successful revolution. The whole German historical
tradition is against any revolutionary solution, and
any radical reform must be imposed from outside.

Let us carefully and dispassionately examine each
of those arguments.


III.

In the first place we are told that Prussian reaction
is too strong, and that for the German people to
attack the Hohenzollern stronghold would be as
hopeless as for a madman or a prisoner to break
down the walls of his prison or cell. The prisoner
would only break his head, and the madman would
only get himself put into a &#8220;strait-waistcoat.&#8221;
The German rebel is confronted by the impregnable
structure of a solid and efficient Government, a
Government based on the prestige of the past, and
surrounded by the glamour of triumphant victories
achieved in great national wars.

The argument might have been valid after 1863
and 1870, when the Catholics fought the battle of
Liberalism and when the Social Democrats fought
the battle of democracy against Bismarck. But the
argument ceases to be valid to-day. For this is not
a national war for the Germans. When the conspiracy
of lies and the conspiracy of silence come
to an end, when the diplomatic intrigues, when the
pan-Germanic plot, are revealed in their naked and[235]
hideous horror, it will be clear, even to the blindest
and dullest German mind, that this war was waged
neither in defence of national existence nor in defence
of national interests. It began primarily as a war
against Russia, who for a hundred and fifty years
was the close ally of Prussia. It began as a war
against the Russian people, who were by far the best
customers for German industries. It developed into
a war against England, who, like Russia, was for one
hundred and fifty years the ally of Germany, who
fought on many a battlefield with the Germans,
who never on any single battlefield fought against
Germany.

Neither can this war be described as a national
war for the German people, nor has it resulted
in a German victory. Here, also, when the conspiracy
of silence is broken, the net result of the war
will prove to be universal ruin, bankruptcy, millions
of cripples walking the streets of every German city,
the loss of the goodwill of the world. &#8220;Tout est
perdu sauf l&#8217;honneur,&#8221; said the French King after
the disaster of Pavia. &#8220;Everything is lost, even
honour,&#8221; will be the verdict of the German people
after the war.

In so far, therefore, as Prussian reaction was
hitherto based on the glamour of victory, that glamour
is dispelled. The Hohenzollerns were supposed to be
the unsurpassed practitioners of Realpolitik. They
have only proved reckless and romantic visionaries.
The Prussian Government was supposed to be a
marvellously efficient instrument. Its efficiency has
mainly shown itself in wanton destruction. The
Prussian Government was supposed to be the perfect[236]
type of a stable government. Its work of five hundred
years has been destroyed in three years. The Germans
had sold their birthright to the Hohenzollern for a
mess of pottage. They have lost their birthright, but
they have not secured the pottage. The German
people had entered into tacit contract. The rulers
have broken the contract. The German people were
ready to surrender their personal liberty for the
advantages which the contract gave them. They
preferred the security of despotism to the risks of
liberty. But the German people have discovered
that the security was illusory, that the advantages
were negative, and that the risks of despotism are
infinitely greater than the perils of liberty.


IV.

But, even granting that the prestige and glamour
of the Hohenzollern Monarchy are dispelled, we shall
be told that it does not necessarily follow that a
revolution would have any chances of success. For
it may still be objected that a revolution is impossible
under modern conditions of warfare, that under
those conditions all the advantages are with the
Government and are not with the people, that it has
become very much easier to-day than in a previous
generation to stamp out a rebellion, and that the
risks are very much greater.

I believe that argument to be entirely fallacious.
I do not believe that the chances are with the
Government. I believe that they are all the other
way. Modern conditions are more favourable to the
prospects of a popular rising than they were, say, in[237]
1789, in 1848, or in 1871. In olden days armies did
not side with the people. They were non-national.
They were professional. They were made up of
mercenaries. The Swiss mercenaries allowed themselves
to be massacred in defence of the monarchy.
The Hessian mercenaries allowed themselves to be
massacred in the service of the Hanoverian Kings.
Nor had the people any military training. To-day
the armies are national armies. They are the people
themselves. They have received a military training.
They have imbibed the military spirit. If
only the people can be gained over to the revolution,
three-fourths of the battle is won.

In this connection it is essential that we should
clearly understand the fundamental differences between
a foreign war and a civil war. A foreign war
is a trial of strength between one nation in arms and
another nation in arms. A rebellion is a trial of
strength between a nation and a Government. In
a foreign war the armies will always be on the side of
the Government. In a revolution the armies may
or may not side with the people. They will side with
the people if the people are determined to fight.

The problem of revolution, therefore, is not primarily
one of military force, but of moral and political
force. The people will dispose of the necessary
military strength if they dispose of the necessary
moral and political strength. In normal times the
people are generally unconscious of their moral and
political strength, even as they are unconscious of
their military strength. But in times of revolution,
with their political consciousness awakened by their
grievances and their sufferings, with a quickened[238]
sense of political realities, the attitude of the people
to their rulers undergoes a radical change. They
suddenly discover that they are the source of all
power. Once that revelation has come to them,
and once the subjects refuse to support their rulers
and are determined to resist them, the whole fabric
of government collapses like a house of cards.
There lies the reason for the fundamental differences
between the slow development of foreign warfare
and the sudden and catastrophic termination of
civil war. The Bastille fell as if by magic and as by
a flourish of trumpets, like the walls of Jericho. The
Revolution of 1848 overthrew in twenty-four hours
the strongest French Government of modern times.
And there, also, lies the reason why, in a civil war,
the greatest possible results are achieved with the
minimum of sacrifice. To attain the aims of a foreign
war may require the sacrifice of millions of lives.
The aims of a civil war have often been obtained
by the sacrifice of a few hundred.

All revolutions have the same beginnings. The
German Revolution of 1848 started in the same way
as the French Revolution of 1848. The insurrection
of the people of Berlin very nearly succeeded in 1848
in establishing a German democracy. The proudest
of the Prussian Kings, the most intoxicated with the
dreams or delusions of absolute power, was humbled
to the dust. In an agony of terror, bareheaded,
Frederick William IV. of Hohenzollern had to salute
the funeral procession of the heroes of liberty, and
the King&#8217;s army had to withdraw from Berlin, and
Prince William, the future Emperor, had to escape
to England.[239]

And the rising of the German people to-day will
have a much better chance than in 1848. If it be
indeed true that a few machine-guns may decide the
issue, it will be by no means difficult for the insurgent
people to secure possession of those machine-guns. If
it be true that a military training is essential to
success, millions of Germans have received that
training. Let only the merest fraction of the people
raise the standard of rebellion, and let the spirit of
rebellion be rife, and that spirit will spread like wild-fire,
and the Hohenzollern Monarchy after this war
will be brought to the ground like a decaying tree
in a November gale.


V.

We shall be told that if a revolution were such an
easy task, it is inconceivable that the German people
should not have risen before; and it is perfectly true
that, since the bloody days of 1848, there has been
no serious riot, not to mention any rebellion, in the
German Monarchy. But the reason for this passive
acquiescence in and for this servile surrender to
despotism is due to the German revolutionaries themselves.
One of the secrets of recent German history
is that the revolutionists themselves have repudiated
revolutionary methods. It is the Social Democrats
who deserted the cause of democracy. In France
Socialists were pacifists abroad and aggressive at
home. In Germany the Socialists were pacifists at
home and aggressive abroad.

That is why, as I anticipated in my &#8220;Anglo-German
Problem&#8221; (1912), the German Socialists are[240]
ultimately responsible for the war, even more than
the Junkers. The Junkers and the Government
knew that they had no reason to dread a renewal of
1848. They felt that they had a perfectly free hand.
They knew the temper of the Social Democrats and
the meaning of the Marxian creed. For it was an
essential part of the Gospel according to St. Marx
that the revolution, if it ever came, would come
peacefully, inevitably, with the people raising their
little finger, through the mere automatic pressure of
economic concentration. Capitalism itself, so the
Socialists said, was working for the triumph of
Socialism. Once the process of concentration of
production was complete, once all the capital was
gathered in a few hands, the German revolution
would come of itself, and Kaiser Bebel and Kaiser
Liebknecht would simply substitute themselves
for Kaiser William as the rulers of an absolute
collectivist State.

That attitude of passive acquiescence, that sordid
materialistic creed, explains the ignominious collapse
of the Social Democrats at the outbreak of the war.
It explains the paradoxical fact that to-day von
Bethmann-Hollweg in his tragic isolation is only supported
by Scheidemann and the Socialist majority.
The failure is not due to any lack of numbers.
For the Social Democrats had millions of devoted
followers. The failure is not due to lack of organization,
for the Social Democrats were the most
admirably organized party known to modern history.
It was not due to lack of discipline, for the Social
Democrats were subjected to an iron discipline. The
failure is entirely due to a lack of spirit, and the[241]
lack of spirit itself is entirely due to the sinister and
dreary Marxian creed. Between Marxian Socialism
and Prussianism there is no opposition of principles.
Indeed, one might almost say that the present war
socialism, with its bread rations, its organization
of industry, its suppression of every individual
liberty, its hundred thousand regulations, is the
nearest approach to the ideal of the Marxist.

But as the result of the war, that Gospel according
to St. Marx is totally and finally discredited. It
is now admitted that the Socialists have been mere
voting machines and doctrinaire opportunists. It is
admitted that no democracy can be built with such
ignoble material. It is admitted that, relinquishing
the servile and materialistic Socialism of Marx, we
must revert to the heroic conception of the British,
French, and Italian Revolutions. It is admitted that
the salvation of a people cannot be attained by the
mere mumbling of catchwords and the waving of
red flags; that it cannot be attained by the mere
proclamation of an iron law of wages; that it can
only be achieved by the display of an iron courage
and by miracles of heroism and self-sacrifice.


VI.

But again granting that the German Socialist
creed is partly responsible for the failure of German
Democracy, it will be objected that this creed is a
typically German creed. Granting that the spirit of
heroism and sacrifice is an essential condition of any
successful revolution, it will be objected that it is
precisely this heroism which is lacking in the German[242]
temperament and in the German race. In a famous
passage of his &#8220;Governance of England,&#8221; Chancellor
Fortescue, who wrote about the time of the Wars
of the Roses, comparing the large number of crimes
of violence and burglary in England with the small
number of such crimes in France and Scotland,
concluded that neither the French nor the Scotch
had the courage and spirit to be burglars.

&#8220;It is not pouerte that kepith Ffrenchmen ffro
rysinge, but it is cowardisse and lakke off hartes
and corage, wich no Ffrenchman hath like vnto a
Englysh man. It hath been offten tymes sene in
Englande, that iij or iiij, theves ffor pouerte haue sett
apon vj or vij trewe men, and robbed hem all. But
it hath not bene sene in Ffraunce, that vj. or vij.
theves haue be hardy to robbe iij. or iiij. trewe men.
Wherfore it is right selde that Ffrenchmen be hanged
ffor robbery and manslaughter, then there be hanged
in Ffraunce ffor such maner of crime in vij yeres.
There is no man hanged in Scotlande in vij yere to
gedur ffor robbery. And yet thai ben often tymes
hanged ffor larceny, and stelynge off good in the
absence off the owner thereoff. But ther hartes
serue hem not to take a manys gode, while he is
present, and woll defende it; wich maner off takynge is
callid robbery. But the Englysh man is off another
corage. Ffor yff he be pouere, and see another man
havynge rychesse, wich may be taken ffrom hym be
myght, he will not spare to do so, but yff that pouere
man be right trewe. Wherfore it is not pouerte, but
it is lakke off harte and cowardisse, that kepith the
Ffrenchmen ffro rysynge.&#8221;

That &#8220;lack of spirit&#8221; which Lord Chancellor[243]
Fortescue so quaintly and so unjustly denounces in
the French and Scottish temperaments, may it not be
more justly attributed to the German temperament?
Are not the Germans constitutionally incapable of
accomplishing a revolution? They lack the red
corpuscles in their veins. They have no phosphorus
or mercury in their composition. They have no &eacute;lan,
no resilience or vitality. They are strong, but only
when they act gregariously, not when they act as
free and irresponsible individuals. They can fight,
but only when they are driven, and only in a quarrel
which is not their own. They fight to-day against
the English as the slaves of the Kaiser even as they
fought for the English as the mercenaries of the
Landgrave of Hesse.

I submit that all those generalizations are essentially
shallow. It is not true that the creed of
Social Democracy is an essentially German creed.
As a matter of fact, the founders of German Socialism,
and some of their chief leaders, are Jews. Lasalle
and Marx were Jews. Bernstein and Adler are Jews.
It is not true that the Germans are constitutionally
incapable of heroism. As a matter of fact, no people
has ever fought more heroically than the millions
of blinded and misguided wretches who challenged
a world in arms, and went to their doom singing
religious hymns and patriotic songs. And it is not
true that there is some mysterious fatality in temperament
or race. The race theory is a Prussian theory,
and it is a sinister theory, the prolific mother of
many political and moral heresies. National temperament
changes with circumstances, and the German
temperament has often changed in the course of[244]
history. If the Germans may be described to-day as
a nation of practical materialists, at one time they
were described as a nation of dreamers. If the
German Government may be described to-day as
a despotic State, at one time it was described as a
Government of free cities.

The truth is that national character has little to
do with race. It is the result of political institutions
and religious beliefs. And it is the political institutions
and religious beliefs of modern Germany which
largely explain the failure of Democracy.

We have already pointed out the baneful influence
of the Socialist creed. But there is another creed
which has exercised an even more baneful influence.
If we attempt to trace, farther back in history, the
main source of German character, we are driven to
the conclusion that it is Lutheranism which is responsible
for the perversion of the German soul, that
it is Lutheranism that is the fons et origo malorum.
Before the war all our ideas about religion and
philosophy in Germany were made up of unmeaning
formulas. And I make the confident forecast that
all those ideas will have to be transvalued in the light
of the present catastrophe.

If I were asked to sum up the achievements
of Lutheranism, I would say that it has accomplished
two things equally fatal to Germany and
Europe.

On the one hand it has broken up the spiritual
unity of Medieval Christendom and the political
unity of the Holy German Empire into two thousand
four hundred petty principalities. It has set up a
tribal religion and the pagan idolatry of the State;[245]
and, on the other hand, it has broken up the human
soul into two water-tight compartments.

Or to express the Lutheran achievement in terms
of freedom and despotism, it has, in the first place,
killed political liberty by surrendering all ecclesiastical
power to the Prince, or to the State incarnated
in the Prince. It has brought about the fusion and
confusion of spiritual and temporal powers. It has
decreed that the religion of the ruler shall determine
the religion of the subject. Cujus regio illius religio.
From the beginning his own ecclesiastical policy
compelled Luther to sanction the bigamy of the
Landgrave Philip of Hesse. In the most violent
of his tracts he denounced a miserable German
peasantry, and he called upon the nobility to massacre
those peasants who had only too faithfully obeyed
the provocations of the reformer.

And, in the second place, Lutheranism has killed
spiritual liberty by creating an inner world of
emotions and of dreams and an outer world of social
and political activities without any relation to the
inner world. It has divorced speculation and action,
theory and practice. The German is like the symbolical
eagle of the Habsburg. He has two heads,
and both look in an opposite direction.

I would say that the poison of Lutheranism has
been acting like that mysterious Indian poison called
&#8220;curare,&#8221; which I used to inject in my distant
student days when I had to dissect frogs in the
Zoological Laboratory at Li&eacute;ge. The &#8220;curare&#8221; does
not kill the nerves, for the frog still suffers under the
dissecting knife. Nor does it kill the muscles, for
the muscles still react if you stimulate them. But[246]
the poison cuts the connection between the nerves
and the muscles. The nerves can no more transmit
their orders to the muscles. Even so Lutheranism
has not killed the thinking power of the German
people. On the contrary, it has given it a morbid
stimulus, as speculation is no more hampered by
reality. Nor has it paralyzed their external activities,
but it has prevented any connection between the
two. It has prevented the thinking from influencing
the acting. It justifies the recent damning statement
of Prince von B&uuml;low, who ought to be a competent
judge, that the Germans have remained an
essentially unpolitical people.

At the outbreak of the Reformation there took
place in Wittenberg, the Mecca of Lutheranism, a
memorable and ominous meeting to which few textbooks
take the trouble to allude, and which has had
more far-reaching consequences than any meeting
known to history. It was the meeting between
Dr. Martinus Luther and the Grand Master of the
Teutonic Order, Albrecht of Hohenzollern. Luther
advised the Grand Master to secularize his Order,
to confiscate its immense territories, and to proclaim
himself Duke of Prussia. Under such auspices
arose the Prussian State. Under such auspices, at
the instigation of the &#8220;Champion of Liberty,&#8221; was
established the most tyrannical despotism of modern
times. Under such auspices was consummated the
unholy alliance between a &#8220;reformed&#8221; Germany
and a twice &#8220;reformed&#8221; Hohenzollern Monarchy.

This unholy alliance has been shattered by the war.
And with the alliance will vanish the Lutheran creed,
with all the evil works that proceeded therefrom.[247]

For four hundred years the German people have
followed their preachers, and have been led by them
to the abyss, even as in the famous ballad of Burger
the German maiden Lenore has fallen under the spell
of a corpse and has been driven to the gates of hell.

For four hundred years the German people have
been in the grip of their despots. They will be under
the spell no more.

For four hundred years the German masses have
practised the three theological virtues of Faith,
Patience, and Obedience. The long-suffering, docile,
and servile Teutons are now ready to surrender to
the original sin of rebellion. They are now ready
to revert to the methods followed by the peasants
massacred by the orders of Luther.

For four hundred years their temporal and spiritual
rulers have manufactured a nation of slaves. The
war has manufactured a nation of revolutionists.
What seemed an inexhaustible inheritance of loyalty
and devotion has been wantonly squandered. The
Hohenzollern Monarchy has been born in spoliation,
baptized in blood, and welded together by iron.
Blood and iron are now destroying it. The German
armies have been the terror of the world. The day
is drawing near when those same German armies
will become a terror to their tyrants, and will call them
to account for the slaughter of twenty nations.



CHAPTER XVIII[248]

VIA PACIS


Whatever excellent reasons we may have for doubting
the sincerity of the German peace overtures, and
whatever grounds we may have for criticizing the
unfortunate wording of the American Notes, it must
be conceded that President Wilson has rendered a
conspicuous service to the Allies by compelling them
to face the formidable difficulties of the problem of
peace. Henceforth it will be impossible for our
rulers to shirk those difficulties. They will have to
give us something more tangible than mere vague
and solemn abstractions, than mere rhetorical phrases
and catchwords: they will have to depend on the
support of public opinion. The peace settlement
will have to be made by the nations themselves, and
not by a few diplomats. It will have to be made in
the full light of day and not in the secret and murky
and musty atmosphere of chancellories.

As a basis for any discussion on the peace settlement
we would lay down the following propositions:

1. We must take good care to retain a firm hold of
fundamental principles, and we must remain loyal
to the conditions which have been proclaimed from
the beginning by the statesmen of the Allies, and
which are summed up in the primary aims, the[249]
&#8220;crushing of Prussian militarism and the liberation
of small nationalities.&#8221;

2. We must see to it that none of the secret agreements
which may have been entered into by the
diplomats of the Allies shall be allowed to conflict
with those fundamental principles.

3. We must realize that those principles are not
particular principles applicable only to Germany and
Austria. They are universal principles, applicable
to all the Powers. &#8220;Prussian militarism&#8221; must be
crushed everywhere, in Great Britain as well as in
Germany, in Finland as well as in Alsace-Lorraine,
in Italy as well as in Austria. Nationalities must
be liberated everywhere, the Ruthenians as well as
the Poles, the Jews as well as the Croatians.

4. We must realize the concrete and deeper meaning
of the vague and somewhat confusing phraseology
contained in the words &#8220;to crush Prussian militarism.&#8221;
To &#8220;crush Prussian militarism&#8221; does not mean only
to crush the German armies. It cannot mean to
crush 100,000,000 German and Austrian people.
It does not mean the repression of the legitimate
expansion of the Teutonic nations. To &#8220;crush
Prussian militarism&#8221; means to do away with a sinister
political system. It means exorcising an evil spirit.
And we must clearly understand that, in order to
exorcise that evil spirit, we must have the co-operation
of the German people themselves. We must help
them to achieve their own salvation. We must take
in the paradoxical and tragic fact that the awful
sacrifice of twenty nations has been mainly a vicarious
sacrifice, and that millions of our soldiers have died
for the good of the enemy as well as for the good of[250]
Europe&mdash;that they have died to make Germany
and Austria free.

5. We must realize that this war is a holy war and
not a punitive expedition, much less a predatory
war. Vengeance must be left to Almighty God.
The punishment of the criminals must be left to the
people themselves.

6. Peace, if it is to be real, and if it is to be permanent,
cannot be achieved by any vindictive policy.
From the moment they enter the peace congress the
belligerents cease to be belligerents, and become allies
in a sacred cause&mdash;the reconstruction of the world.
From the moment the Central Powers are admitted
to cross the threshold of the Temple of Peace they
are readmitted to the community of nations, and they
are admitted on equal terms.

7. A permanent peace excludes the very idea of any
future economic war. We must prevent the Central
Powers from entering into any offensive or defensive
economic alliance. We must repudiate the sinister
delusion of a &#8220;Mittel Europa&#8221; which is haunting
the diseased brains of the Pan-Germanists. On the
other hand, we must repudiate any offensive or
defensive economic alliance between the Allied
Powers. The terms of peace must be engraved on
clean white marble.

8. If a permanent peace is to be attained we must
remove the deeper causes which brought about the
catastrophe. The Central Powers are immediately
and directly responsible for the greatest crime of
history, and they will bear the penalty for generations
to come. They planned the war and forced it
on Europe. But the megalomania of the Teutons[251]
has only been one of the contributory causes. The
war could never have taken place but for the universally
prevailing and universally accepted immorality
of European foreign policy, which is writ
large in Morocco and Persia, in China and Asia
Minor.

9. The principle of nationality, however legitimate
in the case of oppressed nationalities, is not a sufficient
foundation for the new European order. The
principle of nationality, which in the case of small
nations leads to the vindication of freedom, on the
contrary, in the case of great Powers, leads to an aggressive
imperialism. The international principle must
therefore take the place of the national principle.
Federalism and solidarity must take the place of
tribal rivalry and national isolation.

10. Any permanent peace settlement must involve
the unreserved acceptance of a new political philosophy
and the practice of a new political system.
No peace is possible through the old methods of a
balance of power, of alliances and counter-alliances,
of assurance and reassurance treaties. Any balance
of power is unstable and precarious and can only be
maintained by a competition of armaments. The
distinction between offensive and defensive alliances
is essentially unreal. Under the old dispensation a
defensive alliance became offensive as soon as it
felt strong enough to assume the offensive. It is the
system of alliances which led to armaments, and
not the armaments which were responsible for the
alliances. It is therefore futile to speak of disarmament
as long as we do not repudiate the traditional
European principle of the &#8220;balance of power.[252]&#8221;

11. It also follows as a corollary that no peace is
possible merely through a readjustment of boundaries,
through compensations and annexations of territories.
We might recast the whole map of Europe, we might
dismember the German Empire, we might dismember
the Austrian Empire, we might dismember the
Turkish Empire, and yet entirely fail to achieve the
objects for which we entered the war. On the other
hand, we might achieve those objects without shifting
one single milestone of the political boundaries of
Europe.

12. We must clearly realize that the issue of peace
and war is not a military issue, but a political issue,
and that the political issue itself is a moral issue.
It is not a Machtfrage, but a Rechtfrage. It is not a
question to be settled by diplomats of the old school;
it can only be solved by constructive and democratic
statesmanship.

13. To say that &#8220;we must crush Prussian militarism&#8221;
is only a vague and unsatisfactory way of
stating that we must establish democratic government.
Militarism is not a matter of foreign policy,
but of domestic policy. Militarism is but the ultima
ratio of reaction, and all nations are allies against
the one common enemy, reactionary government.

14. It is therefore futile to say that the future
congress must not interfere in the internal government
of any belligerent Power. If any European
Power after this war were still to be ruled by a
reactionary government based on brute force and
oppression, that government would still have to
maintain a large army in order to keep down the
liberties of its people, and such an army would[253]
sooner or later be used against the foreign enemy
in the name of imperial national aspirations, in the
name of a higher civilizing mission.

15. Therefore, the one problem before the European
Congress is to establish government in Europe on a
constitutional and democratic basis, and to grant
a Magna Carta to all nations, great and small. The
establishment of such a government, and not any
annexations or compensations, would alone guarantee
a permanent peace.

16. All civilized nations must be equally interested
in the maintenance of peace and in the establishment
of the new international order. Therefore, all neutral
nations, including the United States of America,
must join the congress as signatories and guarantors
of the peace settlement.

17. The new democratic charter shall be placed
under the guardianship of a Supreme Constitutional
Court. Such a Court would not be a secret diplomatic
Sanhedrin, but a democratic Tribunal. Such a
Court would be essentially different from the Hague
Tribunals of the past, and the democracies of the
world would be directly interested in enforcing its
decrees.

18. There is one immediate sanction to the constitutional
settlement just outlined&mdash;namely, the
Sovereign Will of the people of Europe. Revolution
is knocking at the door. Unless a constitutional
charter be granted, unless democratic government be
firmly established in Europe, it will be wrested from
their rulers by the nations themselves. All the signs
of the times confirm us in the conviction that the
only alternative to the establishment of democratic[254]
government for all the nations participating in the
congress is universal civil war. The peacemakers of
to-morrow have it in their power not only to crush
&#8220;Prussian militarism,&#8221; but to prevent an appalling
upheaval which would shake human society to its
foundations.



APPENDIX[255]

THE PRIVATE MORALITY OF THE
PRUSSIAN KINGS

FREDERICK WILLIAM II.: THE HOHENZOLLERN
POLYGAMIST

By Albert Sorel


It is generally assumed, even by those writers who
are most strongly opposed to the sinister policy of
the Hohenzollerns, that at least their domestic
relations present an edifying contrast with the private
immorality of the other Royal Houses of Europe.
The world has been made familiar with the Court
scandals of the Habsburgs, the Bourbons, and the
Georges, and has heard little of the Hohenzollern
Dynasty. But that is merely because the &#8220;amours&#8221;
and the family squabbles of the Hohenzollerns are
so much less picturesque and so much less interesting
than those of a Henry IV. or of a Louis XIV., and
because they have been hidden under a thick cloud
of hypocrisy. The most brilliant of French historians,
Monsieur Albert Sorel, has torn the veil from this
hypocrisy and has laid bare the sordid story of
Frederick William II.

As an illustration of the manner in which the
official historians of Prussia have narrated the[256]
history of the dynasty, it is instructive to compare
the following character-sketch of the successor of
Frederick the Great with the idealist portrait of
Treitschke (&#8220;Germany History,&#8221; vol. i.), who would
make us believe that Frederick William II. was a
paragon of all the private virtues.


I.

Frederick the Great&#8217;s base tolerance produced
dissolvent effects. Not proceeding from respect of
religious beliefs, it engendered contempt for them.
As, apart from the curb of religion, the new society
of Prussia had no tradition of social morals to rely
upon, corruption entered in and consumed it. The
King&#8217;s scepticism took possession of his subjects,
who translated it into deeds. It was good &#8220;form&#8221;;
everyone in Berlin took it up and conducted himself
accordingly. The leaven of licence and sensuality
which mars all the literature of the century fermented
without let or hindrance in those coarse souls. An
immature civilization had overstimulated imaginations
and senses without abating the brutality of the
primitive passions. In Prussia people lacked the
delicate taste, the genteel habits, the light wit, which
in France qualified the depravity of the age. A
heavy dissoluteness was paraded in Prussia. Officials,
the gentry, women, all fed their minds on d&#8217;Holbach
and La Mettrie, taking their doctrines seriously and
applying them to the very letter.

Add to this that in the newly built Prussian capital
society, utterly artificial as it was, an improvised
amalgam of incongruous elements, was predisposed,[257]
so to speak, to dissoluteness. Berlin swarmed with
army men who had no family life and whose whole day
was not occupied with military duties. Men of letters,
adventurers of the pen and of the sword, attracted
by Frederick&#8217;s reputation and reduced to intrigue
and all sorts of expedients for a living; a nobility,
very poor, very proud, very exclusive, weighed down
by royal discipline and thoroughly bored; a bourgeoisie
enlightened, enriched, but relegated to a
place of its own; between these groups, separated
one from the other by etiquette or prejudice, a sort
of demi-monde where they met, chatted and enjoyed
themselves at their ease, the foyer of &#8220;French ideas,&#8221;
the hub of affairs and intrigues&mdash;Jewish society, the
richest and most elegant in Berlin. With the marvellous
pliancy of their race the Jews had assimilated the
new civilization and took their revenge from the
political exclusion of which they were the victims
by bringing together in their salons all the intellectual
men in Berlin, all the attractive women, all desirous
of liberty and freed from prejudice. Such was Berlin
in the days of Frederick.


II.

One of the finest cities in Europe, wrote Forster
in 1779; but the Berliners! Sociability and refined
taste, he found, degenerated in them into sensuality,
into libertinage (he might almost say voracity),
freedom of wit and love of shining in shameless licence
and unrestrained debauch of thought. The women
in general were abandoned. An English diplomat,
Sir John Harris, afterwards Lord Malmesbury, had[258]
the same impression: Berlin was a town where, if
fortis might be translated by &#8220;honourable,&#8221; you
could say that there was not a vir fortis nec femina
casta.

If you consider that outside Jewish homes money
was scarce, and that temptations are all the stronger
the less means you have of satisfying them, you can
see why in many minds disorder of ideas and corruption
of morals opened a new wound, the most
dangerous, in sooth, and the most repugnant in
nations&mdash;venality. Mirabeau, in his &#8220;Secret History,&#8221;
indelibly recorded all the vices of ce noble tripot,
Berlin. On this head his famous pamphlet is a
picture in violent colours, but true nevertheless.
Cynicism there seems merely local colour. &#8220;&#8216;Rottenness
before Ripeness&#8217;&mdash;I am very much afraid that
must be the motto of Prussian power.... What
cannot money do in a house so poor?&#8221;


III.

It required Frederick&#8217;s hand of iron to set in motion
these complicated springs, to regulate the unwieldy
machine, keep together these elements collected with
no little ingenuity and ready to go to pieces. But
that hand was weighty and hard. There were signs,
in the upper classes at all events&mdash;the only classes
then taken into account&mdash;of a sort of muffled revolt
against this implacable disciple. Besides, the
Prussians entertained queer illusions as to the future.
Frederick had deceived his subjects just as he had
deceived himself regarding the durability of his work.
They did not understand to what an extent their[259]
power was the personal power of their King. Proud
to the point of infatuation of the r&ocirc;le he had made
them play, they imagined it was their own doing,
and that Frederick&#8217;s soul would survive in them.
They expected from a new reign the same glory
abroad, the same security at home, the same relative
prosperity, with a yoke less rough and a discipline
less severe, not understanding that the very roughness
of the yoke and the severity of the discipline were
conditions necessary to the duration of the work.
The mercantile protective system, which had built
up industry; the administration of taxes, which poured
money into the State coffers; the economy, which
immobilized this money in the treasury, hampered
and irritated all who wished to work and trade, all
who reflected on the natural conditions of commerce
and industry; but it was these things alone that enabled
the poorest Government in Europe to be better
armed than the richest, and to keep in the van. In
a word, people wanted the spring to relax, and failed
to see that to slacken the spring meant annihilating
the State.


IV.

To reform Frederick&#8217;s monarchy would have
required no less genius than it took to create it.
Reform, however, was indispensable, since Frederick
alone was capable of holding up the composite edifice
he had built. Hence a threatening and wellnigh inevitable
catastrophe. &#8220;All will go on almost of its
own accord, so long as foreign affairs are quiet and
unbroken,&#8221; wrote Mirabeau after Frederick&#8217;s death.[260]
&#8220;But at the first gunshot or at the first stormy
situation the whole of this little scaffolding of mediocrity
will topple to the ground. How all these
underling Ministers would crumple up! How everyone,
from the distracted chief to the convict-gang,
would shout for a pilot! Who would that pilot be?&#8221;


V.

Frederick&#8217;s nephew, who was called upon to
succeed him, was not made for so great a r&ocirc;le. In
every respect he offered a complete contrast to the
Prince whose weighty heritage he took up. Frederick
in person was infirm and sober; all his prestige lay
in the gaze of his great eyes, which, as Mirabeau put
it, &#8220;at the will of his heroic soul, carried fascination
or terror.&#8221; Frederick William II. was a bel homme,
highly sanguine, very robust, fond of violent exercise
and coarse pleasures. &#8220;The build and strength of
a Royal Guardsman,&#8221; wrote the French Minister
d&#8217;Esterno, who had no liking for him. &#8220;An enormous
machine of flesh,&#8221; said an Austrian diplomat who saw
him at Pillnitz in 1791. &#8220;The true type of a King,&#8221;
according to Metternich, who was presented to him in
1792 at Coblenz, at the time of the German crusade
against France and the Revolution. &#8220;His stature,&#8221;
he added, &#8220;was gigantic, and his corpulence in keeping.
In every company he stood a head higher than
the surrounding crowd. His manners were noble
and engaging.&#8221; He expressed himself with a certain
effort, in little abrupt phrases. There was nothing
in him to recall the implacable and sovereign irony
of Frederick.[261]

&#8220;His look,&#8221; said one apologist, &#8220;does not betoken
a man of genius, but German candour shines on his
brow.&#8221; Strange candour, scarcely recognizable if
you take the word in its common and proper sense.
It must be taken, as was then the practice in Germany,
through translations of Rousseau, in the equivocal
and refined acceptation which reconciled innocence
with indecency, virtue with every disorder of the
imagination and the heart. Ecstatic and sensual,
devout and licentious, a prey to violent appetites,
tormented by scruples, superstitious and debauched,
believing in ghosts, with a tendency towards cabal,
Frederick William had a taste for ethics and a feeling
for religion. He spoke of them with respect, with
awe, with emotion. In his case it was a natural
penchant and at the same time a pose, the attitude
of every heir-presumptive towards the crowned head,
a way of winning admiration and captivating by
force of contrast.


VI.

He and those around him might be gulled by this
&#8220;German candour.&#8221; Not so Frederick. In his
Memoirs he draws his nephew as he was in 1765, at
the age of twenty-one, at the time of his first marriage
with Elizabeth of Brunswick: &#8220;The young husband,
without any morals, given over to a life of debauchery,
was daily guilty of infidelity to his wife. The Princess,
who was in the flower of her beauty, was shocked at
the slight regard shown for her charms. Soon she
plunged into excesses almost as bad as her husband&#8217;s.&#8221;
In 1769 they were divorced. Frederick William[262]
married a Princess of Darmstadt. The second
marriage was no happier than the first. The Princess
did not retaliate, though she did not lack incentives
to do so. The Prince lapsed back into his dissolute
habits. Apart from many passing fancies, he had
a recognized mistress-in-chief. This person, who
managed always to retain the favour, if not the love,
of Frederick William, was the daughter of a humble
musician. She married the Prince&#8217;s valet de chambre,
became Madame Rietz, and was afterwards made
Countess of Lichtenau. Frederick William by the
first marriage had had a daughter, Princess Frederica,
who was brought up by the Queen, the discarded,
not to say repudiated, wife of Frederick the Great.
The father, when visiting the girl, fell in love with
one of her maids-of-honour. Her name was Mademoiselle
de Voss, and she came of a good house, being
cousin to one of the King&#8217;s Ministers, M. de Finckenstein,
and sister of a President of the Chamber.
&#8220;This beauty, who to my mind is very ugly,&#8221; wrote
Mirabeau, &#8220;is a mixture of prudery and cynicism, of
affectation and ingenuousness; she has a natural wit
of a kind, some schooling, manias rather than desires,
a gaucherie which she strives to cover by an appearance
of na&iuml;vet&eacute;.... All her charm lies in her
complexion, and even that I find wan rather than
white; a very beautiful neck. It was this mixture
of unique licence, they say, which she combined with
the airs of innocent ignorance and vestal severity,
that captivated the Prince.[263]&#8221;


VII.

Frederick William was one of those complex
libertines who find in clever resistance a whet to
their passion and a solace to their scruples. The
siege of Mademoiselle de Voss lasted nearly two
years. The outs and ins of this strange romance
were the common talk of the Court. It had not yet
reached its d&eacute;nouement when Frederick the Great&#8217;s
death stopped its course for several weeks. King
from August 17, 1786, onwards, Frederick William
seemed to forget everything but affairs of State.
But Mirabeau affirms, after September 8, &#8220;the
fervour of the novice began to abate.&#8221; Mademoiselle
de Voss, he added, was on the point of yielding.
The King, to make her comfortable, had set up an
establishment for his daughter Frederica; Mademoiselle
de Voss did the honours. The year passed,
however, without the vestal&#8217;s surrendering. She
loved the King, but the honour of the family still
weighed more with her than love. She set rigorous
conditions to her capitulation: a left-handed marriage,
the written consent of the Queen, and the removal
of the titular mistress, Madame Rietz. On this last
point the King was inflexible; he gave in on the other
two. The Queen gave her consent, with the stipulation
that there should be no real divorce or public
separation; she kept her title of Queen and her
position as lawful wife. The rest, it appears, was of
no great interest to her. It only remained to conclude
the marriage, but, under the circumstances,
that was a delicate and ticklish business.[264]

By hook or by crook a precedent had to be found:
the Prussian Consistory proved amenable, and
authorized the marriage. The marriage was celebrated
in July, 1787, in the Chapel Royal of Charlottenburg.
Mademoiselle de Voss took the title of Countess of
Ingenheim. Her happiness was short-lived. She
died in the month of March, 1789. &#8220;All Berlin is
in mourning,&#8221; wrote M. d&#8217;Esterno. &#8220;The Countess
of Ingenheim is cruelly regretted by the people, the
royal family, and even the Queen, much less for the
person of the said Countess as because of the increase
of credit which her death will bring to Dame Rietz,
the old habitual mistress, who is said to be very
avaricious and a great intriguer.&#8221;


VIII.

The literature of the day shed tears over the royal
bereavement, celebrated the &#8220;virtues&#8221; of this
susceptible monarch, and contrasted with the withering
scepticism of Voltaire and the criminal frivolity
of the French the tender abandon with which
Frederick William gave himself up to &#8220;nature&#8217;s
sweetest inclination.&#8221; &#8220;Women-haters,&#8221; wrote
Baron de Trenck, &#8220;have been the scourges of
humanity. The King of Prussia has a great soul,
full of sensibility; in love he is capable of a tender
attachment: he knows the value of his mistress.
Supposing he gives her a million, the money is
divided among the members of the household who
are citizens. He will not rob an honest man of the
spouse who constitutes his happiness, he will not
sacrifice Rome for Cleopatra. He wants to please[265]
all by himself. For twenty months he courted
Mademoiselle de Voss, he married her, he was faithful
to her, he wept over her ashes. Every citizen wise
enough to know human weaknesses must wish that
if he made a fresh choice it would fall on an object
as worthy of his heart. So let him enjoy a happiness
which belongs to the simple peasant as it does to
kings.&#8221; This hypocritical twaddle, this licentious
casuistry, was &#8220;very good style&#8221; in Germany then,
and was highly appreciated.


IX.

The distraction which Trenck desired for the
afflicted soul of the King was not long in presenting
itself. In 1790, on the anniversary of the Countess
of Ingenheim&#8217;s death, Mademoiselle D&#339;nhof was
presented at Court. Everyone there was busy
consoling Frederick William. A claimant had even
been put forward in the person of a young lady called
Viereck, a friend of Mademoiselle de Voss, who had
taken the latter&#8217;s place with Princess Frederica.
Unhappily for Mademoiselle Viereck&#8217;s friends, she
was dark and in no way recalled the dear departed.
Mademoiselle D&#339;nhof, on the other hand, was,
according to the French Minister, &#8220;so perfectly
fair that, while pretty in artificial light, in daylight
she was as yellow as a lemon.&#8221; With the same
charms as Mademoiselle de Voss, she had the same
jumble of pietism and virtue. It was once more a
case of marrying. The King saw no difficulty in
the way. &#8220;I am separated from the Queen,&#8221; he
wrote to Mademoiselle D&#339;nhof; &#8220;Madame d&#8217;Ingenheim[266]
has left me a widower; I offer you my heart
and hand.&#8221; He made no concealment of it, openly
declaring that he had grounds for repudiating the
Queen, but he refrained from taking action upon
them in order to maintain the dignity of the throne.

The Consistory did not require to deliberate a
second time; precedents had been established, and
they were followed. The marriage took place on
April 10, 1790, and it was the Court preacher, Z&#339;llner,
who consecrated it, as he had consecrated that with
Mademoiselle de Voss. The Queen gave the bride
girandoles of diamonds. The Queen-Dowager received
her, and everyone at Court made a fuss of
her. All the same, she was no more successful than
Mademoiselle de Voss in getting rid of Madame
Rietz. This favourite, who had been given 70,000
crowns to take her departure, remained, took
an officer as her lover, and even got the King to
promote him.


X.

And so, in 1790, the King of Prussia, Mademoiselle
de Voss&#8217;s widower, had three wives living: the Princess
of Brunswick, who was repudiated; the Princess of
Darmstadt, who, although divorced, still kept the
rank of Queen; and Mademoiselle D&#339;nhof, morganatic
wife. This third wife, wrote one diplomat, will not
be the last, for &#8220;those the King longs for will also
want to be married.&#8221; The Prince in any case was
always ready. Polygamy, in his eyes, was a prerogative
of royalty. As the result of a Court intrigue
in 1792 he had himself separated from Mademoiselle[267]
D&#339;nhof, crowning by this divorce the strange series
of his conjugal evolutions. Then he offered his
heart and hand to a lady called Bethmann, a banker&#8217;s
daughter whom he had known at Frankfurt, and found
very much to his liking. This young person, in the
words of Lord Malmesbury, was &#8220;all sentiment and
all fire&#8221;; but she had principles and discretion.
She had misgivings about the character of the
marriage and the constancy of the bridegroom. She
refused, thus sparing the Berlin casuists the trouble
of a deliberation still more ticklish than before.
I know not whether these accommodating theologians,
reared in the school of Voltaire and Frederick, took
these simultaneous marriages very seriously or not;
abroad they afforded subject for ridicule, and
Catherine the Great, who herself did not feel bound
to observe so many formalities, was highly amused
at them; &#8220;that big lout of a Gu&#8221;&mdash;such was her name
for Frederick William in her letters to Grimm&mdash;&#8220;that
big lout has just married a third wife; the
libertine never has enough legitimate wives; for a
conscientious libertine, commend me to him.&#8221;


XI.

Frederick William loved women. Women, however,
did not govern him. But if he escaped the
influence of mistresses, he fell under the influence
of favourites, and the people were none the better
off. Badly brought up, kept apart from State
affairs by his uncle, distrusting others because he
was very distrustful of himself, he knew nothing of
the art of government, and dallied with vague[268]
reform projects. The Ministers whom Frederick
left behind, although very second-rate, made him
ill at ease. He was afraid of being considered under
their thumb; besides, these Ministers represented
ideas and a system which he affected to condemn.
&#8220;The King will be led just because he is afraid of
being so,&#8221; wrote Mirabeau. The fear of being
governed by his Ministers delivered him into the hands
of underlings, who promptly gained a mastery
over him by humbling themselves before him, reassuring
his suspicious pride, flattering his passions&mdash;above
all, exploiting the shortcomings of his mind.
Frederick William desired the good of the State; he
had a hazy but quite keen idea of the necessity of
counteracting the excesses of Frederick&#8217;s Government;
but his intentions rambled, and his reform fancies,
more mystical then political, proceeded not so much
from the idea of the interests of the State as from the
influence of a secret doctrine with which he was imbued.
The statesman in him was but an adept in
magic; for Ministers he took mere charlatans. Skilled
conjurers replaced at Potsdam Frederick&#8217;s &#8220;judicious
Ministers.&#8221;


XII.

Of all these mystical adventurers, the one whose
influence was perhaps the most baneful for the
Prussian State was W&#339;llner, a pure intriguer. Son
of a country pastor, he worked his way into the
household of General d&#8217;Itzenplitz; after wheedling
the mother, he ended by marrying the daughter.
Frederick, who was anything but indulgent to mis-alliances,[269]
had him clapped into prison in Berlin.
The hatred of W&#339;llner for the Philosopher-King
dated from that day. At that time he was a
rationalist and a disciple of Wolf; he became a
Freemason. But already in high society in Germany
the wind no longer set in the direction of pure Deism.
W&#339;llner, always a perfect sceptic, changed his
convictions. Considering himself as fitted as any
other for the apparition business and the mystery
industry, he decided to turn &#8220;honest broker&#8221;
between the powers of this world and those of the next,
basing his credit with the former on that which he
claimed with the latter. He joined the Rosicrucians,
and soon became one of the leading lights of the Order.

Thus he knew the man who was to counterbalance
his favour at the Court of Berlin and one day share
with him Frederick&#8217;s Government, the Saxon Bischoffswerder.
The son of a small noble, an officer
of fortune, come like so many others to seek service
in Prussia, he had wormed his way into the favour of
the Prince-Royal, and had quickly taken him in.


XIII.

Mistresses and favourites, Rosicrucians and valets,
theosophists and femmes galantes, on the whole got
on very well together and agreed surprisingly. It
was but a step from the laboratory of the Rosicrucians
to the boudoir of Madame Rietz, and these mystic
personages cleared it without a scrap of shame.
They formed a close alliance with the valet de
chambre and his wife, the ma&icirc;tresse d&#8217;habitude, who
throughout all the matrimonial pranks of the King[270]
managed to preserve her credit by artifices analogous
to those which at Versailles had so long maintained
that of Madame de Pompadour.

Around them swarmed a crowd of subordinate
intriguers, the &#8220;clique,&#8221; as they were called in
Berlin, ready for all sorts of jobs behind the scenes
at Court, in the Army, in politics, in diplomacy&mdash;above
all, in finance. Needy and greedy, they had
a firmly established reputation in Europe for venality.
&#8220;I maintain,&#8221; declared Mirabeau, &#8220;that with a
thousand louis you could, if need be, know perfectly
all the secrets of the Berlin Cabinet.... So the
Emperor has a faithful record of every step of the
King, day by day, and could know everything he
planned, if he planned anything.&#8221; These were the
methods, as Custine affirmed in 1792, that every
diplomatist in the world employed; all the Ministers
who resided in Berlin used them with more success
and more generally than elsewhere.


XIV.

Such was the strange band of adventurers who
pounced on the monarchy and the treasury of
Frederick the Great. Their course of action, very
complex and very powerful, was well designed to
captivate a fantastic and voluptuous bigot. However,
they would never have gained more than an
antechamber or alcove influence, they would never
have risen to political influence, had they not known
how to pervert the noblest inclinations of the King,
whilst flattering the lowest. Mediocre and secondary
as was his place in the line of the Hohenzollerns,[271]
Frederick William was not devoid of all royal qualities.
He was brave, he was kind-hearted, or rather he was
a man of &#8220;sensibility&#8221;; he desired the public weal;
he had suffered, like the nation, from the pitiless
r&eacute;gime of Frederick; like the whole nation, he wanted
to reform the State by lightening the yoke. He
believed himself inspired from on high, &#8220;illumined,&#8221;
and called by Providence to restore the morals and
faith of a country which, he was told, and he himself
believed, was perishing through the scepticism of
men&#8217;s minds and the looseness of men&#8217;s morals.

How could he combine such tendencies with such
tastes, such aspirations with such passions, such
beliefs with such debauchery? It was just therein
that he showed himself a weak character and a
mystic; that was why he joined theurgic sects instead
of submitting to the Church; why he believed in
visions more than in the Gospel, listened to a ventriloquist
mimicking the voice of Frederick instead of
listening to the voices of the Ministers, the great
King&#8217;s disciples; that is why he distrusted wise,
thoughtful, experienced people and surrendered himself
to charlatans and favourites.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
