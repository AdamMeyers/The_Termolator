THE ORIGIN OF THE WEREWOLF SUPERSTITION.1


The belief that a human being is capable of assuming an
animal’s form, most frequently that of a wolf, is an almost
worldwide superstition. Such a transformed person is the Germanic
werewolf, or man-wolf; that is, a wolf which is really
a human being.2 So the werewolf was a man in wolf’s form or
wolf’s dress,2 seen mostly at night,3 and believed generally to
be harmful to man.4

The origin of this werewolf superstition has not been satisfactorily
explained. Adolf Erman5 explains the allusion of
Herodotus6 to the transformation of the Neurians (the people[2]
of the present Volhynia, in West Russia) into wolves as due
merely to their appearance in winter, dressed in their furs. This
explanation, however, would not fit similar superstitions in warm
climes. Others ascribe the origin of lycanthropy to primitive
Totemism, in which the totem is an animal revered by the members
of a tribe and supposed to be hostile to their enemies.7 Still
another explanation is that of a leader of departed souls as the
original werewolf.8

The explanation of the origin of the belief in werewolves must
be one which will apply the world over, as the werewolf superstition
is found pretty much all over the earth,9 especially to-day10
however in Northwest Germany and Slavic lands; namely, in[3]
the lands where the wolf is most common.11      12 According to[4]
Mogk13 the superstition prevails to-day especially in the north
and east of Germany.14

The werewolf superstition is an old one, a primitive one.15[5]
The point in common everywhere is the transformation of a living
human being into an animal, into a wolf in regions where the
wolf was common16 into a lion, hyena or leopard in Africa,
where these animals are common; into a tiger or serpent in
India;17 in other localities into other animals characteristic of
the region.18 Among Lapps and Finns occur transformations
into the bear, wolf, reindeer, fish or birds; amongst many North
Asiatic peoples, as also some American Indians, into the bear;
amongst the latter also into the fox, wolf, turkey or owl; in
South America, besides into a tiger or jaguar, also into a fish, or
serpent. Most universal though it seems was the transformation
into wolves or dogs.19

As the superstition is so widespread—Germany, Eastern
Europe, Africa, Asia, America, it either arose at a very early time,[6]
when all these peoples were in communication with each other20
or else, in accord with another view of modern science, it arose
independently in various continents in process of the natural psychical
development of the human race under similar conditions.

The origin of the superstition must have been an old custom
of primitive man’s of putting on a wolf’s or other animal’s
skin21 or dress, or a robe.22 Thus Leubuscher,23 says: “Es ist[7]
der Mythenkreis eines jeden Volkes aus einfachen wahren Begebenheiten
hervorgewachsen.”24      25 Likely also the notion of attributing
speech to animals originated from such disguising or
dressing of men as animals. In the following we shall examine
into primitive man’s reasons for putting on such a skin or robe.

Primitive man was face to face with animal foes, and had
to conquer them or be destroyed. The werewolf superstition in
Europe arose probably while the Greeks, Romans, Kelts and Germanic
peoples were still in contact with each other, if not in the
original Indo-Germanic home, for they all have the superstition
(unless, as above, we prefer to regard the belief as arising in
various localities in process of psychical development under similar
conditions; namely, when people still lived principally by the
chase.26) Probably the primitive Indo-European man before and
at the time of the origin of the werewolf superstition, was almost
helpless in the presence of inexorable nature. This was before
he used metal for weapons. The great business of life was to
secure food. Food was furnished from three sources, roots,
berries, animals, and the most important of these was animals.27[8]
Without efficient weapons, it was difficult to kill an animal of any
size, in fact the assailant was likely himself to be killed. Yet
primitive man had to learn to master the brute foe. Soon he no
longer crouched in sheltered places and avoided the enemy, but
began to watch and study it, to learn its habits, to learn what
certain animals would do under certain circumstances, to learn
what would frighten them away or what would lure them on.
So at least the large animals were to early man a constant cause
of fear and source of danger; yet it was necessary to have their
flesh for food and their skins for clothing.28

Very soon various ingenious contrivances were devised for
trapping them. No doubt one primitive method was the use of
decoys to lure animals into a trap. Some could be lured by baits,
others more easily by their kind. Occasionally masks were used,29
and similarly, another form of the original decoy was no doubt
simply the stuffed skin of a member of the species, whether animal
or bird, say for example a wild duck.30 Of course the[9]
hunter would soon hit on the plan of himself putting on the animal
skin, in the case of larger animals; that is, an individual dressed
for example in a wolf’s skin could approach near enough to a
solitary wolf to attack it with his club, stone or other weapon,
without exciting the wolf’s suspicion of the nearness of a dangerous
foe.31 So the animal disguise, entire or partial, was used
by early man acting in the capacity of a decoy, firstly, to secure
food and clothing. Secondly, he would assume animal disguise,
whole or partial, in dancing and singing; and both these accomplishments[10]
seem to have arisen from the imitation of the motions
and cries of animals,32 at first to lure them, when acting as a
decoy. With growth of culture came growth of supernaturalism,
and an additional reason for acquiring dance and song was to
secure charms against bodily ills,33 and finally enlivenment.34 In
both dance and song, when used for a serious purpose, the performers
imagined themselves to be the animals they were imitating,35[11]
and in the dance they wore the skins of the animals
represented.36

Probably as long as animal form, partial or entire, was assumed
merely for decoys and sport (early dancing),37 for peaceful
purposes therefore, such people having whole or partial animal
shape were not regarded as harmful to man,38 just as wise women
began to pass for witches only when with their art they did evil.39
A similar development can be traced in the case of masks.40 It
was some time before man could cope with food- and clothing-furnishing
animals that were dangerous to life, though these are
the ones he first studied;41 and we cannot presuppose that he disguised
to represent them until he could cope with them, since the
original purpose of the disguise was to secure food and clothing.
Thus far then we see whole or partial disguise as animals used to
secure food and clothing when acting as decoys to lure animals;
and in dancing.42

[12]

Fourthly, primitive man would put on an animal’s skin or
dress when out as forager (or robber) or spy, for the purpose
of avoiding detection by the enemy. The Pawnee Indians for
example,43 were called by neighboring tribes wolves, probably
not out of contempt, since it may be doubted that an Indian feels
contempt for a wolf any more than he does for a fox, a rabbit, or
an elk, but because of their adroitness as scouts, warriors and
stealers of horses; or, as the Pawnees think, because of their
great endurance, their skill in imitating wolves so as to escape detection
by the enemy by day or night; or, according to some
neighboring tribes, because they prowl like wolves44, “have the
endurance of wolves, can travel all day and dance all night, can
make long journeys, living on the carcasses they find on their
way, or on no food at all.” ... And further, “The Pawnees,
when they went on the warpath, were always prepared to simulate[13]
wolves.... Wolves on the prairie were too common45
to excite remark, and at night they would approach close
to the Indian camps.” ... The Pawnee starting off on the
warpath usually carried a robe made of wolf skins, or in later
times a white blanket or a white sheet; and, at night, wrapping
himself in this, and getting down on his hands and knees, he
walked or trotted here and there like a wolf, having thus transformed
himself into a common object of the landscape. This
disguise was employed by day as well, for reconnoissance....
While the party remained hidden in some ravine or hollow, one
Indian would put his robe over him and gallop to the top of the
hill on all fours, and would sit there on his haunches looking all
over the country, and anyone at a distance who saw him, would
take him for a wolf. It was acknowledged on all hands that the
Pawnees could imitate wolves best. “An Indian going into an
enemy’s country is often called a wolf,46 and the sign for a scout
is made up of the signs wolf and look.”47 Should any scout detect
danger, as at night when on duty near an encampment, he
must give the cry of the coyote.48

The idea of the harmfulness to other men of a man in
animal form or dress became deeply seated now, when men in animal
disguise began to act not only as decoys for animals dangerous
to life, but also as scouts (robbers49—and later as possessors[14]
of supernatural power, when growth of culture brought
with it growth of supernaturalism50); when people began to associate,
for example, the wolf’s form with a lurking enemy.51

All uncivilized tribes of the world are continually on the
defensive, like our American Indian; they all no doubt on occasion
have sent out scouts who, like our American Indians, to avoid
detection, assumed the disguise of the animal most common to
the special locality in question, just as to-day they are known to
disguise in animal skins for purposes of plunder or revenge.52      53

[15]

The kind of animal makes no difference, the underlying
principle is the same; namely, the transformation of a living human
being into an animal. The origin of the belief in such a
transformation, as stated above54 was the simple putting on of
an animal skin by early man. The object of putting on animal
skins was,

(1) To gain food. For this purpose the motions and cries
of animals were imitated (origin of dancing and singing),55
artificial decoys (like decoy ducks to-day)56 and finally even
masks were used.57

[16]

(2) To secure clothing in cold climes by trapping or decoying
animals, as in (1) above.

(3) The imitation when decoying, of the motions of animals
led to dancing, and in the dances and various ceremonies the
faces and bodies of the participants were painted in imitation of
the colors of birds and animals, the motions of animals imitated
and animal disguises used.58

(4) Scouts disguised themselves as animals when out
foraging, as well as for warfare,59      60 therefore for booty, and self-defense.
Either they wore the entire skin, or probably later just
a part of it as a fetich, like the left hind foot of a rabbit, worn as
a charm by many of our colored people to-day.61

[17]

(5) For purposes of revenge,62,63 personal or other. For
some other personal motive of advantage or gain, to inspire terror
in the opposing agent by hideousness.

(6) To inspire terror in the opposing agent by symbolizing
superhuman agencies.64 So now would arise first a belief in[18]
superhuman power or attributes,65 and then,

(7) Witchcraft.66 It is very easy to see why it was usually[19][20]
the so-called medicine-men (more correctly Shamans), who
claimed such transformation power, because they received remuneration
from their patients.67

[21]

(8) Finally dreams68 and exaggerated reports gave rise
to fabulous stories.69

We have discussed (1), (2), and (3);70 for an example under
(4) we have cited the practices of American Indians.71 It is
probable that about now (at the stage indicated in (4) above),
what is known as the real werewolf superstition (that of a frenzied,
rabid manwolf) began to fully develop. The man in wolf-skin
was already a lurking thief or enemy, or a destroyer of human
life. To advance from this stage to the werewolf frenzy, our
primitive man must have seen about him some exhibition of such
a frenzy, and some reason for connecting this frenzy particularly
with, say the wolf. He did see insane persons, and the connecting
link would be the crazy or mad wolf (or dog, as the transformation
was usually into a wolf or dog,72) for persons bitten
by it usually went mad too.73 The ensuing frenzy, with the consternation[22]
it occasioned, soon appealed to certain primitive minds
as a good means of terrorizing others. Of these mad ones some
no doubt actually had the malady; others honestly believed they
had it and got into a frenzy accordingly; others purposely worked
themselves up into a frenzy in order to impose on the uninitiated.74
Later, in the Middle Ages, when the nature of the real
disease came to be better understood, the werewolf superstition
had become too firmly fixed to be easily uprooted.

We have discussed (5), (6), (7), and (8) in the notes.75 As
further examples of the development into fabulous story,76 we may
cite any of those stories in which the wild werewolf, or animal-man
is represented as roaming the land, howling, robbing, and
tearing to pieces men and beasts, until he resumes his human
form. Thus an early scout in animal garb would be obliged
to live on food he found on his way, and later fabulous report
would represent him as himself when in disguise possessing the
attributes of the animal he represented, and tearing to pieces man
and beast. For such an account see Andree,77 concerning what[23]
eyewitnesses reported of the wild reveling over corpses of the
hyena-men of Africa. Naturally the uninitiated savage who witnessed
such a sight would become insane, or at least would spread
abroad such a report as would enhance the influence of the
hyena-men far and wide. Some savages, as in Africa,78 came
to regard any animal that robbed them of children, goats or other
animals, as a witch in animal form;79 just as the American Indians
ascribe to evil spirits death, sickness and other misfortunes.

We can see how at first the man in animal disguise or an
animal robe would go quietly to work, like the Pawnee scout;80
how though, as soon as the element of magic enters in, he would
try to keep up the illusion. At this stage, when the original
defensive measure had become tainted with superstition, men
would go about in the night time howling and holding their
vile revels.81 Andree,82 narrates how a soldier in Northeast
Africa shot at a hyena, followed the traces of blood and came to
the straw hut of a man who was widely famed as a magician.
No hyena was to be seen, only the man himself with a fresh
wound. Soon he died, however the soldier did not survive him
long. Doubtless one of the magician class was responsible for
the death of the soldier, just as we to-day put to death the man
who so violates our laws, as to become a menace to our society,
or as formerly kings killed those who stood in their way; or as[24]
religious sects murder those who dissent from their faith. These
magicians, supposed to be men who could assume animal form,
as a matter of fact do often form a class, are greatly feared by
other natives, often dwell with their disciples in caves and at
night come forth to plunder and kill.83 It is to their interest to
counterfeit well, for if suspected of being malevolent, they were
put to death or outlawed, like criminals to-day.84 Their frenzies
were, as said above, in some cases genuine delusions; in
other cases they offered, as one may readily imagine, excellent
opportunities for personal gain or vengeance.85

[25]

Only by instilling in their fellows a firm belief in this superstition
and maintaining the sham, could the perpetrators of the
outrages hope to escape punishment for their depredations, could
they hope to plunder and steal with impunity.86 So they prowled
usually under the cloak of night or of the dark of the forest,87
howled and acted like the animals they represented, hid the
animal skin or blanket, if they used one,88 in the daytime where
they thought no one could find it, whereas the animal skin which
was worn for defence, was put on either by day or night,89 and
one story recounts the swallowing of a whole goat, the man
bellowing fearfully like a tiger while he did it.90 Some of the
transformed men claimed they could regain human form only
by means of a certain medicine or by rubbing. The imposters
were the criminal class of society that is still with us to-day,91[26]
no longer in werewolf form, but after all wolves in human dress,
each maintaining his trade by deception and countless artifices,
just as did the werewolf of old. Not unlike these shams are those
of the American negro, who in church, when “shouting,” that is,
when stirred up by religious fervor, inflicts blows on his enemy
who happens to be in the church, of course with impunity; for
he is supposed to be under some outside control, and when the
spell has passed off, like some of the delusionists mentioned,92
claims not to know what he (or generally she) has done. Similar
also are the negro voudoo ceremonies, those of the fire-eaters, or
any other sham.

The wolf disguise, or transformation into a werewolf was
that most often assumed for example in Germanic lands.93 The
term wolf became synonymous with robber, and later (when
the robber became an outlaw,94) with outlaw, the robber and outlaw
alike being called wolf and not some other animal (i.      e.,
only the wolf-man surviving to any extent) firstly, because the
wolf was plentiful; and secondly, because as civilization advanced,
there came a time when the wolf was practically the only one of
the larger undomesticated animals that survived.95 We can[27]
notice this in our own United States, for example in eastern
Kansas, where at night coyotes and even wolves are sometimes
heard howling out on the prairie near woodlands, or in the
pastures adjoining farms, where they not infrequently kill smaller
animals, and dig up buried ones.96 In Prussia also it is the wolf
that survives to-day. American Indians, and other savages however
do not restrict the transformations to the wolf,97 because
other wild animals, are, or were till recently, abundant amongst
them. As civilization advances, one by one the animal myths
disappear with the animals that gave rise to them (like that connected
with the mastodon);98 or else stories of such domestic
animals as the pig, white bull, dog superseded them.99 When this
stage was reached, as time went on and means of successfully
coping with the brute creation became perfected, the animals
were shorn of many of their terrors, and finally such stories as
Aesop’s fables would arise.100 This however was psychologically[28]
a long step in advance of our were-wolf believing peoples of an
earlier period.

Up to this point the illustrations have shown that the werewolf
superstition went through various stages of development. The
motives for assuming wolf’s dress (or animal skins or robes), at
first were purely peaceful, for protection against cold, and to
secure food by acting as decoys; then it was used for personal
advantage or gain by foragers (or robbers) and spies; then for
purposes of vengeance;101 later from a desire for power over
others; and finally men (the professional and the superstitious)
began to concoct fabulous stories which were handed down as
tradition or myth, according to the psychic level of the narrator
and hearer.102

[29]

The starting point of the whole superstition of the harmful
werewolf is the disguising as some common animal by members
of savage races when abroad as foragers or scouts, in order to
escape detection by the enemy. Like wolves they roamed the land
in search of food. As stated above,103 later fabulous report would
represent them as possessing in their disguise the attributes of
the animal they impersonated,104 and finally even of actually
taking on animal form, either wholly or in part,105 for longer or
shorter periods of time. Some of the North American Indian
transformation stories represent men as having only the head,
hands and feet of a wolf.106 The transformation into a werewolf
in Germanic lands is caused merely by a shirt or girdle made of
wolf-skin.107 This shirt or girdle of wolf-skin of the Germanic[30]
werewolf is the survival of the robe or mantle originally disguising
the entire body. It would be but a step further to represent
a person as rendering himself invisible by putting on any other
article of apparel, such as the Tarnkappe.108 The stories especially
in Europe were of the were-wolf rather than were-bear or other
animal, because the wolf was the commonest of the larger wild
animals.109 It was the stories of the commonest animal, the wolf,
which crystallized into the household werewolf or transformation
tales.110

NOTES:



1 Note.—After the author had written the following article, she
gathered most of the material contained in the notes. That the origin
and development of the use of masks as given in the Annual Report of the
United States Bureau of Ethnology, 1881-82, p. 73 fol. (see note 32) is
similar to the origin and development of the werewolf superstition itself,
as given in the following pages, was an unexpected coincidence. The
author has italicized some words in the quotations.



2 According to Mogk, in Paul’s Grundriss der germanischen Philologie
III. 272 wer means “man,” found in Old Saxon, Anglo-Saxon, Old High
German, and werewolf a man in wolf’s form. Kögel connects wer with
Gothic wasjan “kleiden.” “Darum bedeutet werwolf eigentlich Wolfsgewand
úlfshamr; ähnlich bedeutet vielleicht berserkr Bärengewand,” therefore
werewolf according to Kögel means a wolf’s dress. See also Schrader,
Reallexikon der indogermanischen Altertumskunde.

proper is far oftener assumed for malignant than for benignant ends. See
note 52.

6 Herodotus says of the Neurians, that among Scythians and Greeks
settled in Scythia they pass for magicians, because once a year every Neurian
becomes a wolf for a few days, and then resumes the human form.

9 See also Mogk in Paul’s Grundriss, III. 272. Dr. Rud. Leubuscher:
Über die Wehrwölfe und Thierverwandlungen im Mittelalter, Berlin, 1850,
mentions cases in ancient Arcadia, in Arabia, Abyssinia (hyenas), and the
almost epidemic disease in the Middle Ages. Dr. W. Hertz, Der Werwolf,
Stuttgart, 1862, ascribes the superstition to Armenia, Egypt, Abyssinia
(hyenas), Greece (pages 20-28), but not to India, contrary to Encyc. Brit.
below; on p. 133 he says: “Tierverwandlungen sind allgemein menschlich,
finden wir überall. Die eigentümliche Entwicklung der Werwolfsagen
aber finden wir vorzugsweise bei einer bestimmten Völkergruppe, den
arischen Stämmen der Griechen, Römer, Kelten, Germanen und Slaven;
bei den südwärts gezogenen Stämmen der Inder und Iranier sind uns
gleiche Sagen nicht begegnet [but see below]. Am massenhaftesten treten
die Werwölfe bei den Slaven auf, und ihnen gehört die älteste historische
Erwähnung der Sage; viel älter aber ist der Lykaon Mythus und arkadische
Werwölfe”. According to Andree, Ethnographische Parallelen und Vergleiche,
Stuttgart, 1878, ss. 62-80, the superstition is found in every European
country (amongst Anglo-Saxons, English, French, Bretons, Poles,
Tschechs, Lithuanians, White Russians of Poland, inhabitants of island
Oesel, Russians, Italians, Portuguese, Provencal peoples, Greeks, Kelts, in
Asia, Africa, America; but not in India nor Persia, contrary to Encyc. Brit.
below), especially though in northwestern Germany and in Slavic lands.

As to the American Indians, see Ethnological Report for 1880-81, p. 83,
“From their close relations with wild animals Indians’ stories of transformations
into beasts and beasts into men are numerous and interesting.... In
times of peace, during the long winter evenings, some famous storyteller
told of those days in the past when men and animals could transform
themselves at will and hold converse with one another.”

Jacob Grimm, Teutonic Mythology, Bell       Sons, 1883, II. 668
says no metamorphosis occurs more frequently in Germanic antiquities
than that of men into werewolves. Thus Fenrisûlfr, a son of Loki, makes
his appearance in wolf’s shape among the gods.

Encyc. Brit. XV. 89 fol., under the heading Lycanthropy, states:—A
belief firmly rooted among all savages is that men are in certain circumstances
transformed temporarily or permanently into wolves and other inferior
animals. In Europe the transformation into a wolf is by far more
prominent and frequent (amongst Greeks, Russians, English, Germans,
French, Scandinavians). Belief in metamorphosis into the animal most
prominent in any locality itself acquires a special prominence. Thus the
were-wolf prevails in Europe, also in England, Wales, Ireland; and in S.
France, the Netherlands, Germany, Lithuania, Bulgaria, Servia, Bohemia,
Poland, Russia, he can hardly be pronounced extinct now (see note 12).
In Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland the bear competes with the
wolf for pre-eminence. In Persia the bear is supreme; in Japan the fox; in
India the serpent vies with the tiger (contrary to Mogk in Paul’s Grd., III.
272, who says:—“Nur Griechen, Römer, Kelten, Germanen, Slaven unter
den indogermanischen Völkern kennen den Werwolf, den Indern und
Iraniern ist er unbekannt.” Compare notes 6 and 9, Hertz, p. 133); in
Abyssinia and Borneo the hyena with the lion; in E. Africa the lion with the
alligator; in W. Africa the leopard is perhaps most frequently the form
assumed by man; among the Abipones the tiger, among the Arawaks the
jaguar, etc.

In Brockhaus’ Konversations-Lexikon, for the Middle Ages the werewolf
belief is ascribed to all Slavic, Keltic, Germanic and Romanic peoples;
found to-day especially in Volhynia and White Russia.

Paul, Grundriss, III. 272:—Bei den Angelsachsen lässt sich der Werwolf
im 11. Jahrh. nachweisen: Knut befahl den Priestern, ihre Herden
vor dem werewulf zu schirmen.... Das älteste Zeugnis auf deutschem
Gebiete vom Werwolf ist vom Burchard v. Worms (11 century).

11 Encyc. Brit. XV. 89 fol.:—There can nowhere be a living belief in
contemporary metamorphosis into any animal which has ceased to exist
in the particular locality. Belief in metamorphosis into the animal most
prominent in any locality itself acquires a special prominence. (See
note 12.) In none of these cases however is the power of transformation
limited exclusively to the prominent and dominant animal.



12 Encyc. Brit. XXIV. 628 fol. under Wolf:—The wolf is found
in nearly the whole of Europe and Asia, North America from Greenland
to Mexico, the Indian peninsula, but not in Ceylon, Burmah or
Siam; and not in South America or Africa, in the two latter jackals
instead.

Meyer’s Kleines konversations-lexikon:—Der wolf “ist häufig in Ost-
und Nordeuropa, Mittel- und Nordasien, Nordamerika, seltener in Frankreich
und Belgien, den Herden gefährlich, besonders in Russland.” Encyc.
Brit., XXIV under Wolf:—In northern countries the wolf is generally
larger and more powerful than in the southern portion of its range.
Its habits are similar everywhere. It has from time immemorial been
known to man in all the countries it inhabits as the devastator of his
flocks of sheep. It has speed and remarkable endurance. They usually
assemble in troops or packs, except in summer, and by their combined
and persevering efforts are able to overpower and kill even such great
animals as the American bison. Children and even grown people
are not infrequently attacked by them when pressed for hunger. The
ferocity of the wolf in the wild state is proverbial. Even when tamed,
they can rarely be trusted by strangers.



13 Paul, Grundriss, III. 272.



14 Gustav Freytag, Bilder aus neuer zeit, Leipzig, 1904, p. 275 fol.,
speaking of the Polish borderlands, says: “Noch lebte das Landvolk
in ohnmächtigem Kampf mit den Heerden der Wölfe, wenig Dörfer,
welchen nicht in jedem Winter Menschen und Thiere decimirt wurden,”
and in the same note 2, pp. 275-6:—“Als 1815 die gegenwärtige Provinz
Posen an Preussen zurückfiel, waren auch dort die Wölfe eine Landplage.
Nach Angaben der Posener Provinzialblätter wurden im Regierungsbezirk
Posen vom 1. Sept. 1815 his Ende Februar 1816, 41 Wölfe erlegt, noch
im Jahre 1819 im Kreise Wongrowitz 16 Kinder und 3 Erwachsene von
Wölfen gefressen.”



15 Thus in note 6 was mentioned Herodotus’ (484-425 B.      C.) statement
about the Neurians. The oldest werewolf legend, according to Hertz, is
that of Lykaon, the son of Pelasgos, the first king of ancient Arcadia.
These Arcadians lived as huntsmen and shepherds. According to J. Oppert
(Andree, p. 65; and notes 6 and 9) the werewolf superstition existed
amongst the Assyrians; and Andree states, the oldest Hellenic werewolf
myth is found in Pausanias (died 467 B.      C). In the Norse “Edda” we find
Odin’s wolves, also Sköll, Hati and Fenrir. In the Völsunga Saga, Sigmund
and Sinfjötli become wolves. For other reflections of the fear in
which wolves were held, see the 10th century ms. of the “Wiener
Hundesegen” against male and female wolves (Braune, Althochdeutsches
Lesebuch, 6. aufl. 1907, p. 85). Jacob Grimm,—Geschichte der deutschen
sprache s. 233:—“Unsere thierfabel stellt vortrefflich das gebannte raubthier
des waldes dar, und lehrt die nähe des wolfs und fuchses.”

C. Lemcke, Aesthetik, 6. aufl. II. 1890, s. 562:—“In die ältesten Zeiten
hinauf reicht auch bei Jägervölkern die Tiersage, in ihrer Weise zum Teil
die Eigentümlichkeiten der Tiere erklärend, ihr Gebahren erzählend.
Die furchtbaren und die listigen Tiere boten sich am besten dar.... Wo
die Menschen städtisch beisammen wohnen, bleibt Tier Tier; wo sie
einsamer mit Tieren leben, bekommen diese eine höhere Bedeutung. So
wird dem Wäldler Bär und Wolf zum ebenbürtigen Räuber und Kämpfer,
menschlicher aufgefasst zum Gegner voll Mut, List, Rachsucht, der
Gedanken hat wie der Mensch selbst.”



16 Volhynia, Europe, Northern Asia. Formerly, according to Andree, p.
65, the wolf was as common throughout Europe as it is to-day in Russia.
Hirt, Die Indogermanen, I. 187, says: “Der Wolf ist überall in Europa
verbreitet gewesen, der Bär ist aber ganz sicher ein Waldtier.”

19 Leubuscher, p. 1:—Weil die Verwandlung vorzugsweise in Hunde
und Wölfe geschehen sollte, so erhielt die Krankheit den namen Lykanthropie.



20 Or as Mogk in Paul’s Grd., III. 272 expresses it, for example
amongst the West Indogermanic peoples when they still formed a whole,
as shepherds, by whom the wolf as robber of herds was especially feared.
Leubuscher, p. 55 writes: “Die meisten Lykanthropen waren Hirten, die
im Freien lebten, mit Tieren viel verkehrten, und der Wolf schwebte
ihrer Einbildungskraft am öftersten vor, weil sie am meisten damit zu
kämpfen hatten. Wenn das Gespenst des Wehrwolfes sich in Einzelnen
als Krankheit erhob, war die Gegend wahrscheinlich von Wölfen besonders
beunruhigt worden, und wahrscheinlich manche Mordthat nur von
Wölfen begangen.” Ethn. Rep. 1888-89, p. 282:—“The Dakotas have long
believed in the appearance from time to time of a monstrous animal that
swallows human beings. The superstition was perhaps suggested by the
bones of mastodons, often found in the territory of those Indians.”



21 Ethn. Rep. 1893-94, p. 267:—In celebrations it is possible that the
foxskin so universally worn by the animistic personifications is a survival
comparable with the skin of the animal in which formerly the whole
body was clothed.



22 Hertz, p. 17, gives the origin as follows: “In der ältesten Naturreligion
ist die Gottheit des Todes und der winterlichen Erde als Wolf
gedacht. Ihre Priester trugen wohl in der Vorzeit Wolfsfelle und hatten
nach dem Volksglauben die Gabe, sich in das Tier der Gottheit zu
verwandeln. Der Wolf, als das schnelle, kampfgewandte Tier, war zum
raschen Zurücklegen weiter Wege und zur Erlegung von Feinden besonders
geeignet. Darum nahmen die Götter und die zauberbegabten Menschen
zu solchen Zwecken Wolfsgestalt. Der Wolf ist von Natur gefährlich und
wurde darum als diabolisch gedacht, und beim Werwolfe auch ist Drang
nach Mord und Zerstörung die Hauptsache. Die Ursprünge des Werwolfglaubens
waren also 1. religiöse Vorstellungen, 2. Rechtsvorstellung
(der friedlose Mörder ist ein Wolf bei Griechen und Germanen); 3. die
Geisteskrankheit der Lykanthropie.” Page 51. “Die Verwandlung in
Wölfe geschieht vorzugsweise durch Wolfshemden.” Page 57: “Dass die
von allem menschlichen Verkehr abgeschnittenen Waldflüchtigen sich in
Tierfelle kleideten, ist nahe liegend.”



23 Page 46. See also note 9.



24 Similarly Dilthey, Erlebnis und Dichtung, 1906, p. 153 fol.;—“Ist so
die Einbildungskraft in Mythos und Götterglauben, zunächst gebunden an
das Bedürfnis des Lebens, so sondert sie sich doch allmählich im Verlauf
der Kultur von den religiösen Zweckbeziehungen und erhebt jene zweite
Welt zu einer unabhängigen Bedeutsamkeit”—like Homer, Dante, etc.
See note 20, close, and Encyc. Brit., Lycanthropy:—“Insane delusions
must reflect the usages and beliefs of contemporaneous society.”



25 Notes 20, 21 and 27.



26 See note 15.



27 Grinnell, Story of the indian, p. 54, says:—Traces of the fear in
which buffalo “were held may still be discovered in the traditional stories
of certain tribes, which set forth how, in those days,” [i.      e. in the stone
age] “before men were provided with arms, the buffalo used to chase, kill,
and eat the people. Such tales show very clearly how greatly the buffalo
were dreaded in ancient times, and such fear could hardly have arisen save
as the result of actual experience of their power to inflict injury and
death.” Pliny informs us how the Romans kept the wolf out of their
fields, see Grimm, Teutonic Mythology, III. 1241. Whether the Indians
lived on the steppes, in the woods, on the coast, or in the mountains,
the animals were their whole study. They moved with the animals,
followed them for food.



28 Note 27.



29 Ethn. Rep. 1881-82, p. 122, note:—It seems that masks were occasionally
used as decoys.... Next to the otter the most valuable animal in
the estimation of the Kadiak men, is the species of seal or sea-dog called
by the Russians nerpa. The easiest manner of taking it is to entice it
toward the shore. A fisherman, concealing the lower part of his body
among the rocks, puts on his head a wooden cap or rather casque resembling
the head of a seal and makes a noise like that animal. The unsuspicious
seal, imagining that he is about to meet a partner of his own
species, hastens to the spot and is instantly killed. Compare note 57.



30 Ethn. Rep. 1896-97, I. 132:—Bering Strait Eskimo stuff rudely the
skin of the bird called ptarmigan, and mount it upon a stick which holds
the head outstretched, then imitate the call of the bird, which is trapped
in the net attached to the decoy. Other decoys are made by molding soft
snow into the form of a bird; for the ptarmigan, brown moss is put around
the neck for plumage. The call then brought the real birds.



31 Thus G.      B. Grinnell, Story of the Indian, p. 61, in his description
of the primitive Indians’ method of trapping buffalo, says: “Some
men went forth naked, others carried a dress made of the entire skin of a
buffalo, the head and horns arranged like a buffalo head, while the rest of
the skin hung down over the wearer’s back,” etc. This “caller” went near
to a herd of buffalo, got them in pursuit of him, then led them into the
trap, a chute, or to a precipice, the fall from which often proved fatal to
the entire herd. Again, in Ethn. Rep. 1884-85, p. 484, about Central Eskimo
seal hunting, is stated: If a hunter is close to an animal he imitates its
movements. Some utter sounds similar to those of a blowing seal. “The
sealskin clothing makes man and seal look so extremely alike that it is
difficult to distinguish one from the other at some distance.” And on p.
508, about deer hunting: In a plain the Central Eskimos carry guns on
their shoulders, two men going together, so as to resemble the antlers of a
deer. The men imitate their grunting. If they lie on the ground at some
distance they greatly resemble the animals themselves. According to
Ross the “inhabitants of Boothia imitate the appearance of the deer, the
foremost of two men stalking a herd bearing a deer’s head upon his own.”
Ethn. Rep. 1888-89, p. 534:—“The old manner of hunting antelope and deer:
the hunter would disguise himself by covering his head with the head and
skin of an antelope, and so be enabled to approach the game near enough
to use his bow and arrow. In a similar manner the Hidatsa would mask
themselves with a wolfskin to enable them to approach buffalo.” Ethn.
Rep. 1901-02, p. 439;—Two of the party of hunters (Zuñi) out after deer
“wear cotton shirts with sleeves to the elbow, the front and back of the
shirt being painted to represent as nearly as possible the body of the deer;
the hands and the arms to the elbow and also the sleeves are colored to
represent the deer’s forelegs. Each wears the skin of a deer’s head over
his head.... In this dress the two huntsmen imitate as closely as possible,
even to the browsing, the game they would catch.”



32 Ethn. Rep. 1897-98, I. 352:—“Tradition says the Iroquois derived the
music and action of the Buffalo dance while on an expedition against the
Cherokee, from the bellowing and the movements of a herd of buffalo
which they heard for the first time ‘singing their favorite songs,’ i.      e.
bellowing and snorting.” Also note 33.



33 Ethn. Rep. 1897-98, I. 266, gives a song to prevent frostbite. The
wolf’s, deer’s, fox’s, opossum’s feet it is held never become frostbitten.
After each verse of the song, the singer imitates the cry and the action of
the animal. The words used are archaic in form and may be rendered
“I become a real wolf, etc.” The song runs:

1. Tsûñ´ wa´ ‘ya-ya´ (repeated four times), wa+a! (prolonged howl).
The singer imitates a wolf pawing the ground with his feet.

2. Tsûñ´-ka´ wi-ye´ (four times), sauh! sauh! sauh! sauh! (imitating
the call and jumping of a deer).

3. Tsûñ´-tsu´ ‘la-ya´ (four times), gaih! gaih! gaih! gaih! (imitates
barking and scratching of a fox).

4. Tsûñ´-sĭ´-kwa-ya´ (four times), kĭ+(imitates cry of the opossum
when cornered, and throws his head back as that animal does when
feigning death).



34 Ethn. Rep. 1881-82, p. 323, about the Omaha Coyote dance performed
by warriors whenever it was thought necessary to keep up their spirits, in
which each had his robe about him and imitated the actions of the coyote,
trotting, glancing around, etc. Page 348 describes the Omaha Buffalo
dance, in which each of four men used to put the skin of a buffalo over
his head, the horns standing up, and the hair of the buffalo head hanging
down below the chest of the wearer. The various movements of the
buffalo were imitated by the dancers. Pages 348-349, the Omaha wolf
dance, by the society of those who have supernatural communication with
wolves. The dancers wear wolfskins, and dance in imitation of the
actions of wolves. Similarly they performed the grizzly bear dance,
horse dance, etc.

37 Similarly in the use of masks (see note 57). See Wundt, Völkerpsychologie
II. i. 412 fol., and in regard to this Zeitschrift für deutsche
Philologie, XXXVIII. 1906, ss. 558-568:—“Der maskierte mensch ist der
ekstatische Mensch. Mit dem anlegen der maske versetzt er sich in
ekstase, fühlt er sich in fremde lebensvorgänge ein, eignet er sich das
wesen an, mit dem er sich durch die maske identificiert.” Für den
naiven menschen, wie für das kind, ist die maske durchaus nicht
blosser schein, sondern wirkender charakter. Der augenblickstanz
wurde zum zaubertanz. Die naturvölker verwenden ihre masken nur
bei den feierlich-ernsten zaubertänzen, nicht zu ihrer burlesken mimik;
die tänzer sind in Tiermasken, etc.



38 Amongst American Indians for example a man transformed into a
bear and vice versa is usually regarded as benevolent (Ethn. Rep. 1880-81,
p. 83). See, also, Grimm, Teutonic Mythology, III. 1097:—In Norse
accounts also we find transformation into a bear, for the bear was regarded
as rational and was esteemed.

42 The important consideration in the mind of primitive man was
whether certain things were harmful or useful. See Behaghel, Die
deutsche Sprache, p. 98:—“Die grossen Tiere und die mächtigen
Bäume, die Tiere und Pflanzen, die für die Ernährung and Bekleidung des
Menschen von Bedeutung sind, die Tiere, die sein Leben bedrohen, sie haben
viel früher sprachliche Bezeichnung gefunden, als der unscheinbare Käfer
im Sande, als die kleine Blume des Waldes. So kommt es, dass die Namen
der grösseren Tiere, der grossen Waldbäume, der wichtigsten Getreidearten
allen germanischer Stämmen gemeinsam sind, einzelne sogar, wie Wolf,
Kuh, Ochse, Birke, Buche, Erle, Gerste mit den Benennungen anderer
indogermanischer Völker übereinstimmen.” Doubtless animals occupied
their attention sooner than plants. See Wundt, Völkerpsychologie, II.
412 fol., about the maskentanz: “Überhaupt haben die Tiermotive weit
früher Berücksichtigung erfahren als die Pflanzenmotive.” See note 95.

45 The werewolf story could arise only where the animal, wolf, tiger or
lion, etc., was common; and likewise the werewolf tales gradually died
out when the animals became rare or extinct. See note 11.

47 The Watusi of East Africa distinctly describe all wild beasts save
their own totem-animals as enemy-scouts (Encyc. Brit. under Lycanthropy).



48 Ethn. Rep. 1881-82, p. 323. See also Grinnell, Story of the indian, p.

the Indian the power to creep right into the midst of the enemy’s camp
without being seen.

51 So originally the germanic god Logi was not an evil god. Logi meant
the natural force of fire; Loki meant the same, but the burly giant has
been made a sly, seducing villain (Grimm, Teut. Myth. I. 241). A son of
Loki, Fenrisûlfr, appears in wolf’s shape among the gods. Perhaps
association with the wolf is in part responsible for the transformation of
Logi (Loki) from a good to an evil god.



52 Encyc. Brit. under Lycanthropy:—In modern savage life we find
beastform of chiefs or spirits, medicine men, some hunt in beast form for
the community; others are said to assume beast form in order to avenge
themselves justly on enemies; others for love of bloodshed and cannibalism.
See also note 58.



53 No doubt some of these men disguised as wolves won considerable
fame through their skill and bravery, as we should judge from such
proper names as Rudolf, which means really Ruhmwolf, Ruhm related to
Gothic hropeigs “victorious,” Sanskrit kir “to praise”; or Adolf from
Adalolf, which means Edelwolf, originally, therefore, Edelräuber, for
wolf meant originally about the same as robber (Kluge). So robber or
wolf was originally a highly respectable appellation, at a time when men
lived from robbery and the chase, either as searobbers, or mountain
robbers, etc. (about this early profession see Hirt, Die Indogermanen,
1905, p. 268 fol.), and the profession was not looked on as a disgrace
(see appellation “wolves” applied to Pawnees, p. 12.). Later we find
such names as Wulfila “little wolf.” Many Indian names are those of
animals, such as Good Fox, Good Bear, Walking Bear, Conquering Bear,
Rushing Bear, Stumbling Bear, Brave Bear, Bear Rib, Smoking Bear,
Biting Bear, Bear-Looks-Back, Cloud Bear, Mad Bear, Mad Wolf, Lone
Wolf, Lean Wolf, Wolf-Ear, Wolf-Robe, etc. See Ethn. Rep. 1882-83,
p. 169: The names of Indians very often refer to some animal, predicating
some attribute or position of that animal. For discussion of names, see
note 111.

57 See note 4 and also Ethn. Rep. 1881-82, p. 73 fol. (see note 37):—The
use of masks is worldwide. The origin and development of the use of
masks is very much the same as the origin and development of the werewolf
as given in the preceding pages. The wolfrobe and the mask, both
originally useful devices, degenerated in unscrupulous hands into instruments
for personal aggrandizement and gain. The use of the mask is described
in the above report as follows:

a). It was used as a shield or protection for the face, for defense
against physical violence, human or otherwise. It was therefore first used
merely as a mechanical resistance to the opposing force; then secondly,
still in the lowest grade of culture, it was used to inspire terror, to gain a
moral influence over the opposing agent by hideousness or by symbolizing
superhuman agencies. Now individual variations arose—devices for example
derived or conventionalized from some predatory, shrewd or mysterious
animal.

b). With growth of culture came growth of supernaturalism, and
the mask came to be used in religious performances, as a part of the religious
paraphernalia, like the shirts or girdles of the shamans. Ethn. Rep.
1896-97, I. 395:—“When worn in any ceremonial, ... the wearer is
believed to become mysteriously and unconsciously imbued with the spirit
of the being which his mask represents.”

c). Finally the element of humor enters in, and the mask is used for
public amusements and games; by secret societies; as protection against
recognition on festive occasions, etc., like the animal skins worn in
dances.

60 Ethn. Rep. 1888-89, p. 503:—Account of “a cloak or mantle made
from the skin of a deer, and covered with various mystic paintings. It was
made and used by the Apaches as a mantle of invisibility, that is, a
charmed covering for spies which would enable them to pass with impunity
through the country, and even through the camp of their enemies. In
this instance the fetichistic power depends upon the devices drawn.” The
Apache have a similar fetich or charm. The symbols drawn were the raincloud,
serpent lightning, raindrops and the cross of the winds of the four
cardinal points. Ethn. Rep. 1889-90, p. 515:—Among the Hidatsa (Sioux)
fetiches are especially the skins of the wolf. “When they go to war, they
always wear the stripe off the back of a wolf skin, with the tail hanging
down the shoulders. They make a slit in the skin through which the warrior
puts his head, so that the skin of the wolf’s head hangs down upon his
breast.” Finally the magic robes or shirts and girdles came to be a part of
the regular paraphernalia of the shamans, or practisers of magic. In the
folklore of all countries we find numerous notices of holy girdles.

Ethn. Rep. 1897-98, I. (Cherokee) 393: “Some warriors had medicine
to change their shape as they pleased, so that they could escape from their
enemies.” Page 501: Such stories might be paralleled in any tribe.



61 See further development in note 64.



62 Note 52.



63 As an example of the motive of vengeance, or pure brutality, we
cite from Andree, p. 69:—People in the interior of Africa who understand
magic, transform themselves into lions and go about killing people. See
also below, note 65, where the wolf-man of Abyssinia kills his enemy and
sucks his blood, and also kills other wolf-men it meets, the question being
one of the survival of the fittest, that is the strongest. All this takes place
at night, which reminds us of our Pawnee Indian starting out at night in
his wolf’s robe, and trotting up to the hostile village to ascertain where his
enemies’ horses are tied, so as to steal them when all are asleep (Grinnell’s
Pawnee hero stories and folk-tales, p. 246, and pp. 70-73). Ethn.
Rep. 1887-88, p. 461:—“To recover stolen or lost property, especially ponies,
is one of the principal tasks imposed upon the so-called medicine-men”
(shamans).



64 As superstition waxed strong, no doubt the wolf robe was put on not
merely to make the wearer look just like a common object of the landscape,
but also because the wearer of the disguise was supposed to take on
the characteristics of the animal he represented (swiftness, boldness, etc.),
as in the case of masks (see note 57), and finally the wearer of such a robe
was believed to actually become transformed, like the wearers of the werewolf
shirt, for example in Germany. Wolves were regarded as good
hunters who never fail, Ethn. Rep. 1897-98, I. 280, also p. 264:—The wolf
is revered by the Cherokee as hunter and watchdog of Kanáti; therefore
we can understand how the wolf disguise, as conferring the quality of unerring
huntsmanship, might be in especial favor amongst those who gained
their food from the chase. Similarly the singing of songs imitating the
cries of certain animals was supposed to confer a characteristic of the animal
in question (see note 33).

Ethn. Rep. 1901-02, p. 394:—To gain animal characteristics a wizard attached
crow and owl plumes to his head that he might have the eyes of the
crow to see quickly the approach of man, and the eyes of the owl to travel
by night. He flapped his arms, ... A Zuñi man hearing a cry like
an owl, yet human, looked about him and found a man whom he recognized
as a Zuñi. “Aha!” said he, “why have you those plumes upon
your head? Aha, you are a sorcerer,” etc.

An example of the transforming power of the robe we find in Bulletin
26, of the Bureau of American Ethnology, Washington, 1901, Kathlamet
texts, p. 156 fol.:—A woman ate of some of the fat of a bitch, gave
birth to five male dogs and one female dog. When they grew older, she
discovered one day that they could transform themselves into real children.
While they were down at the beach, she entered the house, and
now she saw the dog blankets. She took them and burnt them. Then the
children retained their human form (like Sigmund and Sinfjötli in the
Völsungasaga). Page 58 fol., is the Myth of the Elk, according to which
an old man transformed himself into an elk by putting on an elkskin.

W. Golther, Handbuch der germanischen mythologie, 1895, p. 100,
writes, “Die Fähigkeit von Leuten, die sich verwandeln können, heisst ‘sich
zu häuten, die Hülle zu wechseln’. Das Umwerfen eines äusserlichen
Gewandes kann den Wechsel der Gestalt hervorbringen, wie Freyjas
Federgewand, die Schwan- und Krähenhemden der Valkyrjen, Odins
Adlergewand. Die Wolfsgewänder (úlfahamir) wenn angelegt, verwandeln
den Menschen zum Wolfe”. See also Meissner, Ritter Tiodel, Zeitschrift
für deutsches altertum, XLVII. 261.



65 Ethn. Rep. 1901-02, p. 392:—The owner of fine beads fears that some
witch, prompted by jealousy, will strike him with disease.

As another example of the pretended assumption of superhuman
powers to gain influence over others, we may cite the instances given by
Andree, p. 68 fol., according to which Livingston met in Africa a native
said to have power to transform himself into a lion. As lion he would
stay for days and months in the forest, in a sacred hut, to which however
his wife carried beer and food for him, so we may judge that at least this
lion did not cause much devastation amongst the wild beasts. He was able
to reassume human form by means of a certain medicine brought him by
his wife. Again Andree, p. 69:—In Banana, Africa, the members of a certain
family transform themselves in the dark of the forest into leopards.
They throw down those they meet in the forest, but dare not injure them
nor drink their blood, lest they remain leopards. (See note 83.)

The motive of personal gain is exemplified by our American Indians,
who put on a wolf’s mantle to steal, or to recover stolen animals (Grinnell,
Pawnee hero stories, p. 247, also the story of robbery entitled
Wolves in the night, p. 70 fol.). Similarly in Abyssinia, Andree, p. 69,
where the lowest caste of laborers are believed to have power to transform
themselves into hyenas or other animals, as such, plundering graves. They
employ naturally various artifices to help along their cause, since it yields
such returns. They are reported to act like other folk by day, at night
though to assume the ways of wolves, kill their enemies and suck their
blood, roaming about with other wolves till morning. They are supposed
to gain their supernatural powers by a secret beverage made from herbs.
They are not likely to be discovered to be only sham animals, since their
roaming and plundering is done in the night; in the daytime they of
course conceal the animal skins (see Andree, p. 72).

Ethn. Rep. 1880-81, p. 68:—Among the Chaldeans, Egyptians and
Greeks, the success of magic depended upon the ignorance of the masses
and the comparative learning of the few who practised it. Among the
American Indians the medicine-man and the more expert sorceress have
little learning above that of the body of the tribe, and their success depends
entirely upon their own belief in being supernaturally gifted, and
upon the faith and fear of their followers.

The Iroquois believed in people who could assume a partly animal
shape. See Grinnell, Blackfoot lodge tales, p. 79:—“An old blind wolf
with a powerful medicine cured a man, and made his head and hands look
like those of a wolf. The rest of his body was not changed. He was
called a man-wolf.”



66 Ethn. Rep. 1880-81, p. 73:—Witches could and did assume animal
shapes. For example a dog seen by a man which had fire streaming from
its mouth and nostrils. It was night. The man shot at it, and the next
morning tracked it by the marks of blood from its wound. At a bridge a
woman’s tracks took the place of the dog’s, and finally he found the
woman. She had died from the effect of the shot. Page 73: Likewise a
hog, when pursued, disappeared at a small creek, and finally reappeared
as an old man, who said it was he, whom they had been chasing. So they,
the pursuers, knew he was a witch. Page 74: A Canadian Indian one
evening pursued a white bull with fire streaming from its nostrils. He had
never seen a white bull on the reservation before. “As it passed in front of
a house it was transformed into a man with a large white blanket, who was
ever afterward known as a witch.”

Ethn. Rep. 1901-02, p. 395:—A man going out at night noticed a queer-looking
burro. Upon his return home he was told that a large cat had entered
the house. He went out again, discovered a man wrapped in a blanket,
but not in the Zuñi fashion, his head was sunk low in the blanket.
He knew this creature to be a wizard.

Ethn. Rep. 1887-88, p. 458:—That the medicine man (Shaman) has the
faculty of transforming himself into a coyote and other animals at pleasure
and then resuming the human form, is as implicitly believed in by the
American Indians as it was by our own forefathers in Europe. And page
459: The Abipones of Paraguay credit their medicine-men with power
to put on the form of a tiger. The medicine-men of Honduras claimed
the power of turning themselves into lions and tigers. Also the Shamans
of the Nicaraguans possessed similar power. Hertz, p. 133 fol.:—“In der
christlichen Zeit wurde der heidnische Cultus Teufelsanbetung und hier
entstand mit dem Hexenglauben die Vorstellung von Menschen, die sich
mit Hilfe des Satans aus reiner Mordlust zu Wölfen verwandeln. So wurde
der Werwolf das Bild des tierisch Dämonischen in der Menschennatur.”



67 Ethn. Rep. 1887-88, p. 467:—The medicine-men of the Apache are paid
at the time they are consulted, the priest beforehand among the Eskimo.
Ethn. Rep. 1889-90, p. 187: “The magnitude of the disease is generally measured
by the amount of the patient’s worldly wealth.” Page 416:—Sioux
sorcerers prepared love-potions for those who bought them. Ethn. Rep.
1901-2, p. 568:—“The shaman, like the theurgist is usually paid after each visit
with calico, cotton, or food, according to the wealth of the family, since it is
always understood that these doctors expect proper compensation for their
services.” Page 387:—“The Zuñi doctor is paid according to his reputation.”
Grinnell, Blackfoot lodge tales, p. 284: “In early days if a man
remained sick for three or four weeks, all his possessions went to pay
doctors’ fees.”

Ethn. Rep. 1887-88, p. 462 fol.—The American Indian’s theory of disease
is the theory of the Chaldean, the Assyrian, the Hebrew, the Greek, the Roman—all
bodily disorders are attributed to the maleficence of spirits (that
is of animal spirits, ghosts or witches), who must be expelled or placated.
Gibberish was believed to be more potential in magic than was language
which the practitioner or his dupes could comprehend. Page 468:—The
medicine-men are accused of administering poisons to their enemies.
Ethn. Rep. 1889-90, p. 416:—Sioux sorcerers were thought to cause the
death of those persons who had incurred their displeasure. Ethn. Rep.
1887-88, p. 581:—“When an Apache or other medicine-man is in full regalia
he ceases to be a man, but becomes, or tries to make his followers believe
that he has become, the power he represents.” The Mexican priests
masked and disguised, and dressed in the skins of the women offered
up in sacrifice.

So the shaman practiced sorcery, medicine and was a priest. Ethn.
Rep. 1887-88, p. 594:—The Indian doctor relied far more on magic than on
natural remedies. Dreams, beating of the drum, songs, magic feasts and
dances, and howling were his ordinary methods of cure. Grinnell, Story
of the indian, p. 210 fol.:—They have “firm confidence in dreams.”
“Their belief in a future life is in part founded on dreams,” etc.

69 An example of fabulous invention for pure personal gain occurs Andree,
p. 77: If the Greenlanders catch too many seal at one place, the
latter will take a terrible revenge. Assuming human form, they attack
their enemy in the night at his home. This is the transformation of an
animal into a man, but the inventor of the story was no doubt looking
towards his own gain. It is the same old fight for seal protection which
in another form is still going on to-day. Andree, p. 72. In Siam stories
are told of people who by magic formulae become tigers and roam about
at night in search of booty. One of the man-tigers was actually a priest.

73 Grinnell, Blackfoot lodge tales, p. 283: “It is said that wolves,
which in former days were extremely numerous, sometimes went crazy,
and bit every animal they met with, sometimes even coming into
camps and biting dogs, horses and people. Persons bitten by a mad wolf
generally went mad, too. They trembled and their limbs jerked, they
made their jaws work and foamed at the mouth, often trying to bite other
people. When any one acted in this way, his relatives tied him hand and
foot with ropes, and, having killed a buffalo, they rolled him up in the
green hide, built a fire on and around him, leaving him in the fire until
the hide began to dry and burn. Then they pulled him out and removed the
buffalo hide, and he was cured. This was the cure for a mad wolf’s bite.”



74 Sometimes the professionals even became possessed of a monomania
themselves, as in witchcraft. Andree goes into this widespread disease
or delusion (of the first century till late in the middle ages), p. 76 fol.:
“The sick” ones would prowl about burial places at night, imagining
themselves to be wolves or dogs, and go about barking and howling. In
the middle ages such people would even kill children and grown people.
When they came to themselves again, or were cured, they claimed to
know nothing of what had happened. Ethn. Rep. 1888-89, p. 491: Amongst
the Shamans feats of jugglery or pretended magic rivaling or surpassing
the best of spiritualistic seances are recounted. Page 207: The use of
robes made of the hides of buffalo and other large animals, painted with
shamanistic devices, is mentioned. Page 235: The speaker terms himself
a wolf spirit, possessing peculiar power.

79 Ethn. Rep. 1889-90, p. 263. gives the following story of the origin of the
wolf: “The wolf was a poor woman, who had so many children that she
could not find enough for them to eat. They became so gaunt and
hungry that they were changed into wolves, constantly roaming over the
land seeking food.”

conjure.

83 Andree, p. 70, gives an account of the chief magician (Abyssinia),
who demands as yearly tribute of his subordinate animal-men the teeth of
the persons whom they have killed during the year, with which he
decorates his palace. See also pp. 72, 75, etc.: Ethn. Rep. 1885-86, p. 151,
about sorcery among American Indians: Societies existed. The purposes
of the society are twofold; 1. To preserve the traditions of Indian
genesis and cosmogony, etc. 2. To give a certain class of ambitious
men and women sufficient influence through their acknowledged power of
exorcism and necromancy to lead a comfortable life at the expense of the
credulous. Page 162: “Each tribe has its medicine men and women, an
order of priesthood consulted and employed in all times of sickness. It
is to their interest to lead these credulous people to believe that they can
at pleasure hold intercourse with the munedoos,” etc. Sometimes one
family constitutes the class. See note 65; Andree, p. 69.



84 Grimm, Teut. Myth. III. 1104: To higher antiquity witches were
priestesses, physicians, fabulous night-wives, never as yet persecuted.
Maidens might turn into swans, heroes into werewolves, and lose nothing
in popular estimation. The abuse of a spell was punished. A wise
woman, healing sickness and charming wounds, begins to pass for a witch
only when with her art she does evil. In course of time, when the Devil’s
complicity with every kind of sorcery came to be assumed, the guilt of
criminality fell upon all personal relations with him. Ethn. Rep.
1901-2, p. 393: “Though the witch may be regarded as all powerful, none
but the poor and unfortunate are condemned. Few others are even brought
to trial—their prominence prevents public accusation.” This again reminds
us some of our customs; namely, that of overlooking the transgressions
of the rich and powerful. See note 91, and for outlaws note 112.



85 Such artificial frenzies had a serious effect upon the body, and more
particularly the eyes, so that many shamans (Siberia, America, etc.)
become blind.



86 Encyc. Brit., XV. under Lycanthropy: In Prussia, Livonia and Lithuania,
according to two bishops, werewolves were in the 16th century
far more destructive than “true and natural wolves.” They were asserted
to have formed “an accursed college” of those “desirous of innovations
contrary to the divine law.” Also see note 90.

90 Andree, p. 72. This same tiger-man in Asia killed a woman, whose
husband set out in pursuit, followed him to his house, got hold of him
later in his man shape and killed him. Feats similar to some performed
by him are cited in Ethn. Rep. 1887-88, p. 470: The medicine-men of the
Pawnee swallowed arrows and knives, and also performed the trick of
apparently killing a man and bringing him back to life, like the Zuñi.



91 Grimm, Rechtsalterthümer, II. 566: Hexen waren fast alle aus der
ärmsten und niedrigsten Volksklasse (see note 84). Literary Digest,
March 9, 1907, p. 378, article on Spiritualism and Spirituality: “Many,
very many, spiritualists seem to care for communion with spirits only that
they may more surely keep physically well, and earn their bread and
butter and clothing the easier.” Encyc. Brit. under Lycanthropy: The
absurdity of the superstition would have much sooner appeared, but for
the theory that a werewolf when wounded resumed human shape; in
every case where one accused of being a werewolf was taken, he was
certain to be wounded, and thus the difficulty of his not being found in
beast form was satisfactorily disposed of.

95 See note 11, also Ethn. Rep. 1897-98, I. 263: “The deer, which is
still common in the mountains, was the principal dependence of the
Cherokee hunter, and is consequently prominent in myth, folklore, and
ceremonial.” see note 42. Page 264: “The largest gens (clan) in the
tribe bears the name of ‘wolf people.’” Page 420: The Cherokee
have always been an agricultural people, and their old country has a
luxuriant flora, therefore the vegetable kingdom holds a far more important
place in the mythology and ceremonial of the tribe than it does
among the Indians of the treeless plains and arid sage deserts of the West.



96 The St. Louis “Westliche Post” for January 9, 1908, furnishes
another example: A tame wolf which for the past two years has been a
pet in a farmer’s family at Marshfield, Wisconsin, escaped and attacked
a chicken. The farmer’s daughter called to the wolf, but it had become
wild from the taste of blood, attacked her, and bit her on both arms and
one leg. It held so fast that the young lady could not be released until
she had nearly choked the wolf with its collar.

Also the following clipping from the same paper, January 13, 1908,
shows the prevalence of wolves to-day in even quite populous districts:
“Wolf-Plage. Aus dem nördlichen Wisconsin wird gemeldet, dass
Wölfe in diesem Jahre zahlreicher sind denn je, und dass sie, durch
Hunger getrieben, sich nahe an die Ortschaften wagen, und Hausthiere
und auch Menschen angreifen. Zwei grosse Wölfe griffen in dieser Woche
das Pferd der Frau Branchard an; das Pferd scheute und jagte in den
Wald, wo es durch Arbeiter angehalten wurde, welche die Bestien
verscheuchten.”

102 John Fiske, Myths and myth-makers, p. 78, fol., gives the origin
and development of the werewolf as follows: From the conception of
wolf-like ghosts it was but a short step to the conception of corporeal
werewolves.... Christianity did not fail to impart a new and fearful
character to the belief in werewolves. Lycanthropy became regarded as
a species of witchcraft, the werewolf as obtaining his powers from the
Devil. It was often necessary to kill one’s enemies, and at that time some
even killed for love of it (like the Berserker); often a sort of homicidal
madness, during which they would array themselves in the skins of wolves
or bears and sally forth by night to crack the backbones, smash the skulls
and sometimes to drink with fiendish glee the blood of unwary travelers or
loiterers.... Possibly often the wolves were an invention of excited
imagination. So people attributed a wolf’s nature to the maniac or idiot
with cannibal appetites, then the myth-forming process assigned to the
unfortunate wretch a tangible lupine body. The causes were three: 1.
Worship of dead ancestors with wolf totems originated the notion of transformation
of men into divine or superhuman wolves. 2. The storm-wind
was explained as the rushing of a troop of dead men’s souls or as the howling
of wolf-like monsters (called by Christianity demons). 3. Berserker madness
and cannibalism, accompanied by lycanthropic hallucinations, interpreted
as due to such demoniacal metamorphosis, gave rise to the werewolf
superstition of the Middle Ages. The theory that if one put on a
wolf’s skin he became a werewolf, is perhaps a reminiscence of the fact alleged
of Berserkers haunting the woods by night, clothed in hides of wolves
or bears. A permanent cure was effected by burning the werewolf’s sack,
unless the Devil furnished him with a new wolfskin. Primitively,
to become incarnated into any creature, the soul had only to put on the
outward integument of the creature. The original werewolf is the night-wind—a
kind of leader of departed souls, howling in the wintry blasts.
Encyc. Brit, under Lycanthropy:—The Berserkir of Iceland dressed in
the skins of bears and wolves, and further on: “Beastform is in mythology
proper far oftener assumed for malignant than for benignant ends.”

104 Note 57.



105 Close note 65.



106 Grinnell; and Ethn. Rep. 1888-89, p. 737.



107 Grimm, Teutonic Mythology, III. 1094, fol. says: Our oldest native
notions make the assumption of wolf-shape depend on arraying oneself in a
wolf-belt or wolf-shirt, as transformation into a swan does on putting on the
swan-shirt or swan-ring. Page 1095: “The transformation need not be
for a magical purpose at all: any one that puts on, or is conjured into, a
wolf-shirt, will undergo metamorphosis.... With the appearance, he
acquires also the fierceness and howling of the wolf; roaming the woods,
he rends to pieces everything that comes in his way.” This is like the belief
of the American Indian that the wearer of a mask becomes imbued
with the spirit of the being which his mask represents (note 57); or that
the shaman in full regalia becomes, or tries to make his followers believe
that he has become, the power he represents (note 67).



108 Thus some American Indian stories represent men transformed into
wolf, turkey or owl turning into stone or piece of decayed wood when pursued.
And mantles of invisibility are mentioned in note 60.



109 See Hirt, Die Indogermanen, I. 187: “Unter den grossen Raubtieren
treten uns Bär und Wolf mit alten Namen entgegen. Der Wolf ist
freilich überall in Europa verbreitet gewesen, der Bär ist aber ganz sicher
ein Waldtier,” etc. Encyc. Brit, under Lycanthropy: “In England by
the 17th century the werewolf had long been extinct. Only small creatures,
the cat, hare, weasel, etc., remained for the malignant sorcerer to
transform himself into.” See note 11.



110 Amongst the American Indians, where various larger animals were
common, the designation “wolf-people” (see the sign-language of the
plains) was bestowed especially on the Pawnees, because, as we have seen,
they best imitated wolves. In Europe, where, of the larger animals, the
wolf alone was universally common, the designation “wolf-people” (or if we
choose, later, werewolves) was not restricted to any one locality or people,
but was bestowed in general on those who assumed the manner of wolves,
and because of their crimes became outcasts like the wolves. They best
imitate wolves, and no doubt, to escape detection, disguised themselves as
wolves (see note 102), and for this reason the warg or outlaw came to be
called a wolf (see close of note 112). Thus Golther, Mythologie, p. 102,
says: “Wird ein Werwolf verwundet oder getötet, so findet man einen
wunden oder toten Menschen.” The werewolves, as we have seen (ante
p. 25), keep to the woods and the dark, of course in many cases to avoid
detection. Similarly witches, Ethn. Rep. 1901-02, p. 393: “They say that
witches love the night and lurk in shadows and darkness. Witches are
believed to be able to assume the shape of beasts.” Sigmund and Sinfjötli
dwelt as wolves in the woods. Also the progenitor of the Mýramenn in
Iceland at night could leave his house in wolf’s form. Another Norwegian
account reports how earlier many people were able to take on wolf’s
form, then dwelt in grove and woods, where they tore people to pieces,
etc. See Paul, Grundriss, III. 272 fol.; also note 113.



111 Names. See note 31. The development in the case of names was
perhaps the same as in the case of masks (note 57), and of the werewolf
superstition itself (ante p. 15, fol.); namely, a) protection against outside
agencies was sought; b) growth of supernaturalism; c) element of
humor.

a) See Encyc. Brit. under Lycanthropy: “Children are often
named wolf, are disguised as a wolf to cheat their supernatural foes” (for
similar assumption of characteristics or the nature of animals for personal
advantage see note 33). See also Grimm, Teutonic Mythology, III.
1139: “The escort of wolf or raven augured victory;” and in the note:
“A name of happiest augury for a hero must have been the O.      H.      G.
Wolf-hraban (Wolfram), to whom the two animals jointly promised
victory. Old names are no product of pure chance. Servian mothers
name a son they have longed for, Vuk, Wolf: then the witches can’t eat
him up. O.      H.      G. Wolfbizo was a lucky name, i.      e., one bitten by the
wolf and thereby protected,” like our modern curing of like by like in
medicine.

b) With growth of supernaturalism came probably the development
mentioned by Meringer, Indog. Forsch., 1904, XVI. 165, about the conferring
of secret names, since one could harm a person by his name
alone, and could summon a foe merely by mentioning his name: “Wenn
man den Wolf nennt, kommt er g’rennt.” Again in XXI. 313 fol.: It
was dangerous to name bear or wolf in regions infested by these animals,
so people, out of fear, avoided calling the name of such animals; called
the bear for example honey-eater, etc.

c) Finally, when man could better cope with animal foes, his fear of
them disappeared, the elements of fearlessness and humor enter in, and
such names arise as are mentioned in note 53; and such stories as that of
Romulus and Remus, suckled by a wolf.



112 Outlaws. The notion of werewolves (see Grimm, Teutonic Mythology,
III. 1095) also gets mixed up with that of outlaws who have fled to
the woods. A notable instance is that of Sigmund and Sinfjötli in the
Völsungasaga. In regard to this W. Golther, Handbuch der germanischen
mythologie, Leipzig 1895, p. 102, says: “Die Sage mag auf einem
alten Misverständniss beruhen. Warg, Wolf hiess der Geächtete in der
germanischen Rechtssprache. Warg wurde wörtlich als Wolf verstanden,
und so bildete sich die Werwolfsgeschichte.” Golther again, p. 424:—“Gefesselt
wurde Loki als Ächter in den Wald getrieben, er wurde “Warg”,
d. h. Wolf. Wölfe heissen die friedlosen Waldgänger.” As to warg, Schade
in his altdeutsches Wörterbuch defines it as a räuberisch würgendes
wütendes Wesen, Mensch von roher verbrecherischer Denk- und Handlungsweise,
geächteter Verbrecher, ausgestossener Missetäter; warg ist Benennung
des Wolfes, in der Rechtssprache ein treu- und vertragbrüchiger
Mensch, vogelfreier Mann, der den Frieden durch Mord gebrochen und
landflüchtig geworden, oder nun im wilden Walde gleich dem Raubtiere
haust und wie der Wolf ungestraft erlegt werden darf; im jetzigen Gebrauche
auf Island Bezeichnung einer gewalttätigen Person. Similarly, J. Grimm,
Gesch. d. d. Spr. p. 233. For customs amongst the American Indians
relating to the outlaw see Ethn. Rep. 1879-80, p. 67 fol.: An outlaw is one
who by his crimes has placed himself without the protection of his clan,
is not defended in case he is injured by another. When the sentence of
outlawry has been declared, for example among the Wyandots, it is the
duty of the chief of the Wolf clan to make known the decision of the
council.... In outlawry of the highest degree it is the duty of any member
of the tribe who may meet the offender to kill him like an animal. Page 60
fol.: “The chief of the Wolf gens is the herald and the sheriff of the tribe”
(see also Ethn. Rep. 1893-94, p. cxiv). Criminals kept to the woods and the
dark. Many of them lived like animals, dressed in animal skins, and to
terrorize others assumed the role of werewolves. Since therefore so many
outlaws lived, dressed (note 22 close) and acted like wolves, to all intents
and purposes became wolves, wolf and outlaw became synonymous terms.



113 The widespread custom of keeping windows closed at night in Germany
is perhaps a relic of heathen days, when people believed that werewolves,
etc., entered houses at night. In place of the earlier harmful
werewolf is now the “harmful” night air.

Transcriber’s note


The cover of this book was created by the transcriber and is placed in
the public domain.

Anchors for notes 37 and 42 were missing in the original, they were
added. Notes 111, 112 and 113 also had no anchors in the original, they
were referred to in other notes. The notes were gathered at the end of
the text and provided with links.

“Völsungasaga” and “Sinfjötli” were in the original mostly written with
a little c under the o, and a few times with a plain o. For reader's
convenience this has been changed and standardised to the more common
spelling with ö.

Some punctuation was corrected and a few missing spaces added.
In note 12 “and” was changed to “und” (seltener in Frankreich
und Belgien).

Otherwise the original was preserved, including possible errors and
missing capitalisation in quotes from German sources, and inconsistent
spelling, for example the word Berserkr, Berserker or Berserkir.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
