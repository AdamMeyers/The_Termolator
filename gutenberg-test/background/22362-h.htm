<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>These papers were originally published as prefaces to the separate books
of Dickens in one of the most extensive of those cheap libraries of the
classics which are one of the real improvements of recent times. Thus
they were harmless, being diluted by, or rather drowned in Dickens. My
scrap of theory was a mere dry biscuit to be taken with the grand tawny
port of great English comedy; and by most people it was not taken at
all&mdash;like the biscuit. Nevertheless the essays were not in intention so
aimless as they appear in fact. I had a general notion of what needed
saying about Dickens to the new generation, though probably I did not
say it. I will make another attempt to do so in this prologue, and,
possibly fail again.</p>

<p>There was a painful moment (somewhere about the eighties) when we
watched anxiously to see whether Dickens was fading from the modern
world. We have watched a little longer, and with great relief we begin
to realise that it is the modern world that is fading. All that universe
of ranks and respectabilities in comparison with which Dickens was
called a caricaturist, all that Victorian universe in which he seemed
vulgar&mdash;all that is itself breaking up like a cloudland. And only the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
caricatures of Dickens remain like things carved in stone. This, of
course, is an old story in the case of a man reproached with any excess
of the poetic. Again and again when the man of visions was pinned by the
sly dog who knows the world,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;The man recovered of the bite,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dog it was that died.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>To call Thackeray a cynic, which means a sly dog, was indeed absurd; but
it is fair to say that in comparison with Dickens he felt himself a man
of the world. Nevertheless, that world of which he was a man is coming
to an end before our eyes; its aristocracy has grown corrupt, its middle
class insecure, and things that he never thought of are walking about
the drawing-rooms of both. Thackeray has described for ever the
Anglo-Indian Colonel; but what on earth would he have done with an
Australian Colonel? What can it matter whether Dickens&rsquo;s clerks
talked cockney now that half the duchesses talk American? What would
Thackeray have made of an age in which a man in the position of Lord Kew
may actually be the born brother of Mr. Moss of Wardour Street? Nor does
this apply merely to Thackeray, but to all those Victorians who prided
themselves on the realism or sobriety of their descriptions; it applies
to Anthony Trollope and, as much as any one, to George Eliot. For we
have not only survived that present which Thackeray described: we have
even survived that future to which George Eliot looked forward. It is no
longer adequate to say that Dickens did not understand that old world of
gentility, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
of parliamentary politeness and the balance of the
constitution. That world is rapidly ceasing to understand itself. It is
vain to repeat the complaint of the old Quarterly Reviewers, that
Dickens had not enjoyed a university education. What would the old
Quarterly Reviewers themselves have thought of the Rhodes Scholarships?
It is useless to repeat the old tag that Dickens could not describe a
gentleman. A gentleman in our time has become something quite
indescribable.</p>

<p>Now the interesting fact is this: That Dickens, whom so many considered
to be at the best a vulgar enthusiast, saw the coming change in our
society much more soberly and scientifically than did his better
educated and more pretentious contemporaries. I give but one example out
of many. Thackeray was a good Victorian radical, who seems to have gone
to his grave quite contented with the early Victorian radical
theory&mdash;the theory which Macaulay preached with unparalleled luminosity
and completeness; the theory that true progress goes on so steadily
through human history, that while reaction is indefensible, revolution
is unnecessary. Thackeray seems to have been quite content to think that
the world would grow more and more liberal in the limited sense; that
Free Trade would get freer; that ballot boxes would grow more and more
secret; that at last (as some satirist of Liberalism puts it) every man
would have two votes instead of one. There is no trace in Thackeray of
the slightest consciousness that progress could ever change its
direction. There is in Dickens. The whole of <i>Hard Times</i> is the
expression of just such a realisation. It is not true to say that
Dickens was a Socialist, but it is not absurd <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
to say so. And it would be simply absurd to say it of any of the great
Individualist novelists of the Victorian time. Dickens saw far enough
ahead to know that the time was coming when the people would be
imploring the State to save them from mere freedom, as from some
frightful foreign oppressor. He felt the society changing; and Thackeray
never did.</p>

<p>As talking about Socialism and Individualism is one of the greatest
bores ever endured among men, I will take another instance to illustrate
my meaning, even though the instance be a queer and even a delicate one.
Even if the reader does not agree with my deduction, I ask his attention
to the fact itself, which I think a curiosity of literature. In the last
important work of Dickens, that excellent book <i>Our Mutual Friend</i>,
there is an odd thing about which I cannot make up my mind; I do not
know whether it is unconscious observation or fiendish irony. But it is
this. In <i>Our Mutual Friend</i> is an old patriarch named Aaron, who is a
saintly Jew made to do the dirty work of an abominable Christian usurer.
In an artistic sense I think the patriarch Aaron as much of a humbug as
the patriarch Casby. In a moral sense there is no doubt at all that
Dickens introduced the Jew with a philanthropic idea of doing justice to
Judaism, which he was told he had affronted by the great gargoyle of
Fagin. If this was his motive, it was morally a most worthy one. But it
is certainly unfortunate for the Hebrew cause that the bad Jew should be
so very much more convincing than the good one. Old Aaron is not an
exaggeration of Jewish virtues; he is simply not Jewish, because he is
not human. There is nothing about him <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
that in any way suggests the nobler sort of Jew, such a man as Spinoza
or Mr. Zangwill. He is simply a public apology, and like most public
apologies, he is very stiff and not very convincing.</p>

<p>So far so good. Now we come to the funny part. To describe the high
visionary and mystic Jew like Spinoza or Zangwill is a great and
delicate task in which even Dickens might have failed. But most of us
know something of the make and manners of the low Jew, who is generally
the successful one. Most of us know the Jew who calls himself De
Valancourt. Now to any one who knows a low Jew by sight or hearing, the
story called <i>Our Mutual Friend</i> is literally full of Jews. Like all
Dickens&rsquo;s best characters they are vivid; we know them. And we
know them to be Hebrew. Mr. Veneering, the Man from Nowhere, dark,
sphinx-like, smiling, with black curling hair, and a taste in florid
vulgar furniture&mdash;of what stock was he? Mr. Lammle, with &ldquo;too much
nose in his face, too much ginger in his whiskers, too much sparkle in
his studs and manners&rdquo;&mdash;of what blood was he? Mr. Lammle&rsquo;s
friends, coarse and thick-lipped, with fingers so covered with rings
that they could hardly hold their gold pencils&mdash;do they remind us of
anybody? Mr. Fledgeby, with his little ugly eyes and social flashiness
and craven bodily servility&mdash;might not some fanatic like M. Drumont make
interesting conjectures about him? The particular types that people hate
in Jewry, the types that are the shame of all good Jews, absolutely run
riot in this book, which is supposed to contain an apology to them. It
looks at first sight as if Dickens&rsquo;s apology were one hideous
sneer. It looks as if he put <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
in one good Jew whom nobody could believe in, and then balanced him
with ten bad Jews whom nobody could fail to recognise. It seems as if he
had avenged himself for the doubt about Fagin by introducing five or six
Fagins&mdash;triumphant Fagins, fashionable Fagins, Fagins who had
changed their names. The impeccable old Aaron stands up in the middle of
this ironic carnival with a peculiar solemnity and silliness. He looks
like one particularly stupid Englishman pretending to be a Jew, amidst
all that crowd of clever Jews who are pretending to be Englishmen.</p>

<p>But this notion of a sneer is not admissible. Dickens was far too frank
and generous a writer to employ such an elaborate plot of silence. His
satire was always intended to attack, never to entrap; moreover, he was
far too vain a man not to wish the crowd to see all his jokes. Vanity is
more divine than pride, because it is more democratic than pride. Third,
and most important, Dickens was a good Liberal, and would have been
horrified at the notion of making so venomous a vendetta against one
race or creed. Nevertheless the fact is there, as I say, if only as a
curiosity of literature. I defy any man to read through <i>Our Mutual
Friend</i> after hearing this suggestion, and to get out of his head the
conviction that Lammle is the wrong kind of Jew. The explanation lies, I
think, in this, that Dickens was so wonderfully sensitive to that change
that has come over our society, that he noticed the type of the oriental
and cosmopolitan financier without even knowing that it was oriental or
cosmopolitan. He had, in fact, fallen a victim to a very simple fallacy
affecting this problem. Somebody said, with great wit and truth, that
treason <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
cannot prosper, because when it prospers it cannot be called treason.
The same argument soothed all possible Anti-Semitism in men like
Dickens. Jews cannot be sneaks and snobs, because when they are sneaks
and snobs they do not admit that they are Jews.</p>

<p>I have taken this case of the growth of the cosmopolitan financier,
because it is not so stale in discussion as its parallel, the growth of
Socialism. But as regards Dickens, the same criticism applies to both.
Dickens knew that Socialism was coming, though he did not know its name.
Similarly, Dickens knew that the South African millionaire was coming,
though he did not know the millionaire&rsquo;s name. Nobody does. His
was not a type of mind to disentangle either the abstract truths
touching the Socialist, nor the highly personal truth about the
millionaire. He was a man of impressions; he has never been equalled in
the art of conveying what a man looks like at first sight&mdash;and he simply
felt the two things as atmospheric facts. He felt that the mercantile
power was oppressive, past all bearing by Christian men; and he felt
that this power was no longer wholly in the hands even of heavy English
merchants like Podsnap. It was largely in the hands of a feverish and
unfamiliar type, like Lammle and Veneering. The fact that he felt these
things is almost more impressive because he did not understand them.</p>

<p>Now for this reason Dickens must definitely be considered in the light
of the changes which his soul foresaw. Thackeray has become classical;
but Dickens has done more: he has remained modern. The grand
retrospective spirit of Thackeray is by its nature
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
attached to places and times; he belongs to Queen Victoria as much as
Addison belongs to Queen Anne, and it is not only Queen Anne who is
dead. But Dickens, in a dark prophetic kind of way, belongs to the
developments. He belongs to the times since his death when Hard Times
grew harder, and when Veneering became not only a Member of Parliament,
but a Cabinet Minister; the times when the very soul and spirit of
Fledgeby carried war into Africa. Dickens can be criticised as a
contemporary of Bernard Shaw or Anatole France or C. F. G. Masterman. In
talking of him one need no longer talk merely of the Manchester School
or Puseyism or the Charge of the Light Brigade; his name comes to the
tongue when we are talking of Christian Socialists or Mr. Roosevelt or
County Council Steam Boats or Guilds of Play. He can be considered under
new lights, some larger and some meaner than his own; and it is a very
rough effort so to consider him which is the excuse of these pages. Of
the essays in this book I desire to say as little as possible; I will
discuss any other subject in preference with a readiness which reaches
to avidity. But I may very curtly apply the explanation used above to
the cases of two or three of them. Thus in the article on <i>David
Copperfield</i> I have done far less than justice to that fine book
considered in its relation to eternal literature; but I have dwelt at
some length upon a particular element in it which has grown enormous in
England after Dickens&rsquo;s death. Thus again, in introducing the
<i>Sketches by Boz</i> I have felt chiefly that I am introducing them to a
new generation insufficiently in sympathy with such palpable and
unsophisticated fun. A Board School education,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
evolved since Dickens&rsquo;s day, has given to our people a queer and
inadequate sort of refinement, one which prevents them from enjoying the
raw jests of the <i>Sketches by Boz</i>, but leaves them easily open to that
slight but poisonous sentimentalism which I note amid all the merits of
David Copperfield. In the same way I shall speak of <i>Little Dorrit</i>,
with reference to a school of pessimistic fiction which did not exist
when it was written, of <i>Hard Times</i> in the light of the most modern
crises of economics, and of <i>The Child&rsquo;s History of England</i> in
the light of the most matured authority of history. In short, these
criticisms are an intrinsically ephemeral comment from one generation
upon work that will delight many more. Dickens was a very great man, and
there are many ways of testing and stating the fact. But one permissible
way is to say this, that he was an ignorant man, ill-read in the past,
and often confused about the present. Yet he remains great and true, and
even essentially reliable, if we suppose him to have known not only all
that went before his lifetime, but also all that was to come after.</p>

<p>From this vanishing of the Victorian compromise (I might say the
Victorian illusion) there begins to emerge a menacing and even monstrous
thing&mdash;we may begin again to behold the English people. If that strange
dawn ever comes, it will be the final vindication of Dickens. It will be
proved that he is hardly even a caricaturist; that he is something very
like a realist. Those comic monstrosities which the critics found
incredible will be found to be the immense majority of the citizens of
this country. We shall find that Sweedlepipe cuts our hair and
Pumblechook sells <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
our cereals; that Sam Weller blacks our boots and
Tony Weller drives our omnibus. For the exaggerated notion of the
exaggerations of Dickens (as was admirably pointed out by my old friend
and enemy Mr. Blatchford in a <i>Clarion</i> review) is very largely due to
our mixing with only one social class, whose conventions are very
strict, and to whose affectations we are accustomed. In cabmen, in
cobblers, in charwomen, individuality is often pushed to the edge of
insanity. But as long as the Thackerayan platform of gentility stood
firm all this was, comparatively speaking, concealed. For the English,
of all nations, have the most uniform upper class and the most varied
democracy. In France it is the peasants who are solid to uniformity; it
is the marquises who are a little mad. But in England, while good form
restrains and levels the universities and the army, the poor people are
the most motley and amusing creatures in the world, full of humorous
affections and prejudices and twists of irony. Frenchmen tend to be
alike, because they are all soldiers; Prussians because they are all
something else, probably policemen; even Americans are all something,
though it is not easy to say what it is; it goes with hawk-like eyes and
an irrational eagerness. Perhaps it is savages. But two English cabmen
will be as grotesquely different as Mr. Weller and Mr. Wegg. Nor is it
true to say that I see this variety because it is in my own people. For
I do not see the same degree of variety in my own class or in the class
above it; there is more superficial resemblance between two Kensington
doctors or two Highland dukes. No; the democracy is really composed of
Dickens characters, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>
for the simple reason that Dickens was himself one of the democracy.</p>

<p>There remains one thing to be added to this attempt to exhibit Dickens
in the growing and changing lights of our time. God forbid that any one
(especially any Dickensian) should dilute or discourage the great
efforts towards social improvement. But I wish that social reformers
would more often remember that they are imposing their rules not on dots
and numbers, but on Bob Sawyer and Tim Linkinwater, on Mrs. Lirriper and
Dr. Marigold. I wish Mr. Sidney Webb would shut his eyes until he <i>sees</i>
Sam Weller.</p>

<p>A great many circumstances have led to the neglect in literature of
these exuberant types which do actually exist in the ruder classes of
society. Perhaps the principal cause is that since Dickens&rsquo;s time
the study of the poor has ceased to be an art and become a sort of sham
science. Dickens took the poor individually: all modern writing tends to
take them collectively. It is said that the modern realist produces a
photograph rather than a picture. But this is an inadequate objection.
The real trouble with the realist is not that he produces a photograph,
but that he produces a composite photograph. It is like all composite
photographs, blurred; like all composite photographs, hideous; and like
all composite photographs, unlike anything or anybody. The new
sociological novels, which attempt to describe the abstract type of the
working-classes, sin in practice against the first canon of literature,
true when all others are subject to exception. Literature must always be
a pointing out of what is interesting in life; but these books are
duller than the life they <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>
represent. Even supposing that Dickens did exaggerate the degree to
which one man differs from another&mdash;that was at least an
exaggeration upon the side of literature; it was better than a mere
attempt to reduce what is actually vivid and unmistakable to what is in
comparison colourless or unnoticeable. Even the creditable and necessary
efforts of our time in certain matters of social reform have discouraged
the old distinctive Dickens treatment. People are so anxious to do
something for the poor man that they have a sort of subconscious desire
to think that there is only one kind of man to do it for. Thus while the
old accounts were sometimes too steep and crazy, the new became too
sweeping and flat. People write about the problem of drink, for
instance, as if it were one problem. Dickens could have told them that
there is the abyss between heaven and hell between the incongruous
excesses of Mr. Pickwick and the fatalistic soaking of Mr. Wickfield. He
could have shown that there was nothing in common between the brandy and
water of Bob Sawyer and the rum and water of Mr. Stiggins. People talk
of imprudent marriages among the poor, as if it were all one question.
Dickens could have told them that it is one thing to marry without much
money, like Stephen Blackpool, and quite another to marry without the
smallest intention of ever trying to get any, like Harold Skimpole.
People talk about husbands in the working-classes being kind or brutal
to their wives, as if that was the one permanent problem and no other
possibility need be considered. Dickens could have told them that there
was the case (the by no means uncommon case) of the husband of Mrs.
Gargery as well as of the wife <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span>
of Mr. Quilp. In short, Dickens saw the problem of the poor not as a
dead and definite business, but as a living and very complex one. In
some ways he would be called much more conservative than the modern
sociologists, in some ways much more revolutionary.</p>

<h3>LITTLE DORRIT</h3>

<p>In the time of the decline and death of Dickens, and even more strongly
after it, there arose a school of criticism which substantially
maintained that a man wrote better when he was ill. It was some such
sentiment as this that made Mr. George Gissing, that able writer, come
near to contending that <i>Little Dorrit</i> is Dickens&rsquo;s best book. It
was the principle of his philosophy to maintain (I know not why) that a
man was more likely to perceive the truth when in low spirits than when
in high spirits.</p>

<h3>REPRINTED PIECES</h3>

<p>The three articles on Sunday of which I speak are almost the last
expression of an articulate sort in English literature of the ancient
and existing morality of the English people. It is always asserted that
Puritanism came in with the seventeenth century and thoroughly soaked
and absorbed the English. We are now, it is constantly said, an
incurably Puritanic people. Personally, I have my doubts about this. I
shall not refuse to admit to the Puritans that they conquered and
crushed the English people; but I do not think that they ever
transformed it. My doubt <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[xx]</a></span>
is chiefly derived from three historical facts. First, that England was
never so richly and recognisably English as in the Shakespearian age
before the Puritan had appeared. Second, that ever since he did appear
there has been a long unbroken line of brilliant and typical Englishmen
who belonged to the Shakespearian and not the Puritanic tradition;
Dryden, Johnson, Wilkes, Fox, Nelson, were hardly Puritans. And third,
that the real rise of a new, cold, and illiberal morality in these
matters seems to me to have occurred in the time of Queen Victoria, and
not of Queen Elizabeth. All things considered, it is likely that future
historians will say that the Puritans first really triumphed in the
twentieth century, and that Dickens was the last cry of Merry England.</p>

<p>And about these additional, miscellaneous, and even inferior works of
Dickens there is, moreover, another use and fascination which all
Dickensians will understand; which, after a manner, is not for the
profane. All who love Dickens have a strange sense that he is really
inexhaustible. It is this fantastic infinity that divides him even from
the strongest and healthiest romantic artists of a later day&mdash;from
Stevenson, for example. I have read <i>Treasure Island</i> twenty times;
nevertheless I know it. But I do not really feel as if I knew all
<i>Pickwick</i>; I have not so much read it twenty times as read in it a
million times; and it almost seemed as if I always read something new.
We of the true faith look at each other and understand; yes, our master
was a magician. I believe the books are alive; I believe that leaves
still grow in them, as leaves grow on the trees. I believe that this
fairy library flourishes <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</a></span>
and increases like a fairy forest: but the world is listening to us,
and we will put our hand upon our mouth.</p>

<h3>OUR MUTUAL FRIEND</h3>

<p>One thing at least seems certain. Dickens may or may not have been
socialist in his tendencies; one might quote on the affirmative side his
satire against Mr. Podsnap, who thought Centralisation
&ldquo;un-English&rdquo;; one might quote in reply the fact that he
satirised quite as unmercifully state and municipal officials of the
most modern type. But there is one condition of affairs which Dickens
would certainly have detested and denounced, and that is the condition
in which we actually stand to-day. At this moment it is vain to discuss
whether socialism will be a selling of men&rsquo;s liberty for bread.
The men have already sold the liberty; only they have not yet got the
bread. A most incessant and exacting interference with the poor is
already in operation; they are already ruled like slaves, only they are
not fed like slaves. The children are forcibly provided with a school;
only they are not provided with a house. Officials give the most
detailed domestic directions about the fireguard; only they do not give
the fireguard. Officials bring round the most stringent directions about
the milk; only they do not bring round the milk. The situation is
perhaps the most humorous in the whole history of oppression. We force
the nigger to dig; but as a concession to him we do not give him a
spade. We compel Sambo to cook; but we consult his dignity so far as to
refuse him a fire.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[xxii]</a></span>
This state of things at least cannot conceivably endure. We must either
give the workers more property and liberty, or we must feed them
properly as we work them properly. If we insist on sending the menu into
them, they will naturally send the bill into us. This may possibly
result (it is not my purpose here to prove that it will) in the drilling
of the English people into hordes of humanely herded serfs; and this
again may mean the fading from our consciousness of all those elves and
giants, monsters and fantastics whom we are faintly beginning to feel
and remember in the land. If this be so, the work of Dickens may be
considered as a great vision&mdash;a vision, as Swinburne said, between a
sleep and a sleep. It can be said that between the grey past of
territorial depression and the grey future of economic routine the
strange clouds lifted, and we beheld the land of the living.</p>

<p>Lastly, Dickens is even astonishingly right about Eugene Wrayburne. So
far from reproaching him with not understanding a gentleman, the critic
will be astonished at the accuracy with which he has really observed the
worth and the weakness of the aristocrat. He is quite right when he
suggests that such a man has intelligence enough to despise the
invitations which he has not the energy to refuse. He is quite right
when he makes Eugene (like Mr. Balfour) constantly right in argument
even when he is obviously wrong in fact. Dickens is quite right when he
describes Eugene as capable of cultivating a sort of secondary and false
industry about anything that is not profitable; or pursuing with passion
anything that is not his business. He is quite right in making Eugene
honestly appreciative <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[xxiii]</a></span>
of essential goodness&mdash;in other people. He is quite right in
making him really good at the graceful combination of satire and
sentiment, both perfectly sincere. He is also right in indicating that
the only cure for this intellectual condition is a violent blow on the
head.</p>

<h3>DAVID COPPERFIELD</h3>

<p>The real achievement of the earlier part of <i>David Copperfield</i> lies in
a certain impression of the little Copperfield living in a land of
giants. It is at once Gargantuan in its fancy and grossly vivid in its
facts; like Gulliver in the land of Brobdingnag when he describes
mountainous hands and faces filling the sky, bristles as big as hedges,
or moles as big as molehills. To him parents and guardians are not
Olympians (as in Mr. Kenneth Grahame&rsquo;s clever book), mysterious
and dignified, dwelling upon a cloudy hill. Rather they are all the more
visible for being large. They come all the closer because they are
colossal. Their queer features and weaknesses stand out large in a sort
of gigantic domesticity, like the hairs and freckles of a
Brobdingnagian. We feel the sombre Murdstone coming upon the house like
a tall storm striding through the sky. We watch every pucker of
Peggotty&rsquo;s peasant face in its moods of flinty prejudice or
whimsical hesitation. We look up and feel that Aunt Betsey in her garden
gloves was really terrible&mdash;especially her garden gloves. But one cannot
avoid the impression that as the boy grows larger these figures grow
smaller, and are not perhaps so completely satisfactory.</p>

<p class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[xxiv]</a></p>

<h3>CHRISTMAS BOOKS</h3>

<p>And there is doubtless a certain poetic unity and irony in gathering
together three or four of the crudest and most cocksure of the modern
theorists, with their shrill voices and metallic virtues, under the
fulness and the sonorous sanity of Christian bells. But the figures
satirised in <i>The Chimes</i> cross each other&rsquo;s path and spoil each
other in some degree. The main purpose of the book was a protest against
that impudent and hard-hearted utilitarianism which arranges the people
only in rows of men or even in rows of figures. It is a flaming
denunciation of that strange mathematical morality which was twisted
often unfairly out of Bentham and Mill: a morality by which each citizen
must regard himself as a fraction, and a very vulgar fraction. Though
the particular form of this insolent patronage has changed, this revolt
and rebuke is still of value, and may be wholesome for those who are
teaching the poor to be provident. Doubtless it is a good idea to be
provident, in the sense that Providence is provident, but that should
mean being kind, and certainly not merely being cold.</p>

<p><i>The Cricket on the Hearth</i>, though popular, I think, with many sections
of the great army of Dickensians, cannot be spoken of in any such
abstract or serious terms. It is a brief domestic glimpse; it is an
interior. It must be remembered that Dickens was fond of interiors as
such; he was like a romantic tramp who should go from window to window
looking in at the parlours. He had that solid, indescribable delight in
the mere solidity and neatness of funny little humanity in its funny
little <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[xxv]</a></span>
houses, like doll&rsquo;s houses. To him every house was a box, a
Christmas box, in which a dancing human doll was tied up in bricks and
slates instead of string and brown paper. He went from one gleaming
window to another, looking in at the lamp-lit parlours. Thus he stood
for a little while looking in at this cosy if commonplace interior of
the carrier and his wife; but he did not stand there very long. He was
on his way to quainter towns and villages. Already the plants were
sprouting upon the balcony of Miss Tox; and the great wind was rising
that flung Mr. Pecksniff against his own front door.</p>

<h3>TALE OF TWO CITIES</h3>

<p>It was well for him, at any rate, that the people rose in France. It was
well for him, at any rate, that the guillotine was set up in the Place
de la Concorde. Unconsciously, but not accidentally, Dickens was here
working out the whole true comparison between swift revolutionism in
Paris and slow evolutionism in London. Sidney Carton is one of those
sublime ascetics whose head offends them, and who cut it off. For him at
least it was better that the blood should flow in Paris than that the
wine should flow any longer in London. And if I say that even now the
guillotine might be the best cure for many a London lawyer, I ask you to
believe that I am not merely flippant. But you will not believe it.</p>

<h3>BARNABY RUDGE</h3>

<p>It may be said that there is no comparison between
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[xxvi]</a></span>
that explosive opening of the intellect in Paris and an antiquated
madman leading a knot of provincial Protestants. The Man of the Hill,
says Victor Hugo somewhere, fights for an idea; the Man of the Forest
for a prejudice. Nevertheless it remains true that the enemies of the
red cap long attempted to represent it as a sham decoration in the style
of Sim Tappertit. Long after the revolutionists had shown more than the
qualities of men, it was common among lords and lacqueys to attribute to
them the stagey and piratical pretentiousness of urchins. The kings
called Napoleon&rsquo;s pistol a toy pistol even while it was holding up
their coach and mastering their money or their lives; they called his
sword a stage sword even while they ran away from it. Something of the
same senile inconsistency can be found in an English and American habit
common until recently: that of painting the South Americans at once as
ruffians wading in carnage, and also as poltroons playing at war. They
blame them first for the cruelty of having a fight; and then for the
weakness of having a sham fight. Such, however, since the French
Revolution and before it, has been the fatuous attitude of certain
Anglo-Saxons towards the whole revolutionary tradition. Sim Tappertit
was a sort of answer to everything; and the young men were mocked as
&rsquo;prentices long after they were masters. The rising fortune of the
South American republics to-day is symbolical and even menacing of many
things; and it may be that the romance of riot will not be so much
extinguished as extended; and nearer home we may have boys being boys
again, and in London the cry of &ldquo;clubs.&rdquo;</p>

<p class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[xxvii]</a></p>

<h3>THE UNCOMMERCIAL TRAVELLER</h3>

<p><i>The Uncommercial Traveller</i> is a collection of Dickens&rsquo;s memories
rather than of his literary purposes; but it is due to him to say that
memory is often more startling in him than prophecy in anybody else.
They have the character which belongs to all his vivid incidental
writing: that they attach themselves always to some text which is a fact
rather than an idea. He was one of those sons of Eve who are fonder of
the Tree of Life than of the Tree of Knowledge&mdash;even of the knowledge of
good and of evil. He was in this profoundest sense a realist. Critics
have talked of an artist with his eye on the object. Dickens as an
essayist always had his eye on an object before he had the faintest
notion of a subject. All these works of his can best be considered as
letters; they are notes of personal travel, scribbles in a diary about
this or that that really happened. But Dickens was one of the few men
who have the two talents that are the whole of literature&mdash;and have them
both together. First, he could make a thing happen over again; and
second, he could make it happen better. He can be called exaggerative;
but mere exaggeration conveys nothing of his typical talent. Mere
whirlwinds of words, mere melodramas of earth and heaven do not affect
us as Dickens affects us, because they are exaggerations of nothing. If
asked for an exaggeration of something, their inventors would be
entirely dumb. They would not know how to exaggerate a broom-stick; for
the life of them they could not exaggerate a tenpenny nail. Dickens
always began with the nail or the broom-stick. He always
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[xxviii]</a></span>
began with a fact even when he was most fanciful; and even when he drew
the long bow he was careful to hit the white.</p>

<p>This riotous realism of Dickens has its disadvantage&mdash;a disadvantage
that comes out more clearly in these casual sketches than in his
constructed romances. One grave defect in his greatness is that he was
altogether too indifferent to theories. On large matters he went right
by the very largeness of his mind; but in small matters he suffered from
the lack of any logical test and ready reckoner. Hence his comment upon
the details of civilisation or reform are sometimes apt to be jerky and
jarring, and even grossly inconsistent. So long as a thing was heroic
enough to admire, Dickens admired it; whenever it was absurd enough to
laugh at he laughed at it: so far he was on sure ground. But about all
the small human projects that lie between the extremes of the sublime
and the ridiculous, his criticism was apt to have an accidental quality.
As Matthew Arnold said of the remarks of the Young Man from the Country
about the perambulator, they are felt not to be at the heart of the
situation. On a great many occasions the Uncommercial Traveller seems,
like other hasty travellers, to be criticising elements and institutions
which he has quite inadequately understood; and once or twice the
Uncommercial Traveller might almost as well be a Commercial Traveller
for all he knows of the countryside.</p>

<p>An instance of what I mean may be found in the amusing article about the
nightmares of the nursery. Superficially read it might almost be taken
to mean that Dickens disapproved of ghost stories&mdash;disapproved
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">[xxix]</a></span>
of that old and genial horror which nurses can hardly supply fast
enough for the children who want it. Dickens, one would have thought,
should have been the last man in the world to object to horrible
stories, having himself written some of the most horrible that exist in
the world. The author of the Madman&rsquo;s Manuscript, of the disease
of Monk and the death of Krook, cannot be considered fastidious in the
matter of revolting realism or of revolting mysticism. If artistic
horror is to be kept from the young, it is at least as necessary to keep
little boys from reading <i>Pickwick</i> or <i>Bleak House</i> as to refrain from
telling them the story of Captain Murderer or the terrible tale of
Chips. If there was something appalling in the rhyme of Chips and pips
and ships, it was nothing compared to that infernal refrain of
&ldquo;Mudstains, bloodstains&rdquo; which Dickens himself, in one of
his highest moments of hellish art, put into <i>Oliver Twist</i>.</p>

<p>I take this one instance of the excellent article called
&ldquo;Nurse&rsquo;s Stories&rdquo; because it is quite typical of all
the rest. Dickens (accused of superficiality by those who cannot grasp
that there is foam upon deep seas) was really deep about human beings;
that is, he was original and creative about them. But about ideas he did
tend to be a little superficial. He judged them by whether they hit him,
and not by what they were trying to hit. Thus in this book the great
wizard of the Christmas ghosts seems almost the enemy of ghost stories;
thus the almost melodramatic moralist who created Ralph Nickleby and
Jonas Chuzzlewit cannot see the point in original sin; thus the great
denouncer of official oppression in England may be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">[xxx]</a></span>
found far too
indulgent to the basest aspects of the modern police. His theories were
less important than his creations, because he was a man of genius. But
he himself thought his theories the more important, because he was a
man.</p>

<hr /><p class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1" id="Page_1">[1]</a></p>
<h2><a name="SKETCHES" id="SKETCHES"></a>SKETCHES BY BOZ</h2>

<p>The greatest mystery about almost any great writer is why he was ever
allowed to write at all. The first efforts of eminent men are always
imitations; and very often they are bad imitations. The only question is
whether the publisher had (as his name would seem to imply) some
subconscious connection or sympathy with the public, and thus felt
instinctively the presence of something that might ultimately tell; or
whether the choice was merely a matter of chance and one Dickens was
chosen and another Dickens left. The fact is almost unquestionable: most
authors made their reputation by bad books and afterwards supported it
by good ones. This is in some degree true even in the case of Dickens.
The public continued to call him &ldquo;Boz&rdquo; long after the public
had forgotten the <i>Sketches by Boz</i>. Numberless writers of the time
speak of &ldquo;Boz&rdquo; as having written <i>Martin Chuzzlewit</i> and
&ldquo;Boz&rdquo; as having written <i>David Copperfield</i>. Yet if they had
gone back to the original book signed &ldquo;Boz&rdquo; they might even
have felt that it was vulgar and flippant. This is indeed the chief
tragedy of publishers: that they may easily refuse at the same moment
the wrong manuscript and the right man. It is easy to see of Dickens now
that he was the right man; but a man might have been very well excused
if he had not realised <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
that the <i>Sketches</i> was the right book. Dickens, I say, is a case for
this primary query: whether there was in the first work any clear sign
of his higher creative spirit. But Dickens is much less a case for this
query than almost all the other great men of his period. The very
earliest works of Thackeray are much more unimpressive than those of
Dickens. Nay, they are much more vulgar than those of Dickens. And worst
of all, they are much more numerous than those of Dickens. Thackeray
came much nearer to being the ordinary literary failure than Dickens
ever came. Read some of the earliest criticisms of Mr. Yellowplush or
Michael Angelo Titmarsh and you will realise that at the very beginning
there was more potential clumsiness and silliness in Thackeray than
there ever was in Dickens. Nevertheless there was some potential
clumsiness and silliness in Dickens; and what there is of it appears
here and there in the admirable <i>Sketches by Boz</i>.</p>

<p>Perhaps we may put the matter this way: this is the only one of
Dickens&rsquo;s works of which it is ordinarily necessary to know the
date. To a close and delicate comprehension it is indeed very important
that <i>Nicholas Nickleby</i> was written at the beginning of Dickens&rsquo;s
life, and <i>Our Mutual Friend</i> towards the end of it. Nevertheless
anybody could understand or enjoy these books, whenever they were
written. If <i>Our Mutual Friend</i> was written in the Latin of the Dark
Ages we should still want it translated. If we thought that <i>Nicholas
Nickleby</i> would not be written until thirty years hence we should all
wait for it eagerly. The general impression produced by Dickens&rsquo;s
work is the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
same as that produced by miraculous visions; it is the destruction of
time. Thomas Aquinas said that there was no time in the sight of God;
however this may be, there was no time in the sight of Dickens. As a
general rule Dickens can be read in any order; not only in any order of
books, but even in any order of chapters. In an average Dickens book
every part is so amusing and alive that you can read the parts
backwards; you can read the quarrel first and then the cause of the
quarrel; you can fall in love with a woman in the tenth chapter and then
turn back to the first chapter to find out who she is. This is not
chaos; it is eternity. It means merely that Dickens instinctively felt
all his figures to be immortal souls who existed whether he wrote of
them or not, and whether the reader read of them or not. There is a
peculiar quality as of celestial pre-existence about the Dickens
characters. Not only did they exist before we heard of them, they
existed also before Dickens heard of them. As a rule this unchangeable
air in Dickens deprives any discussion about date of its point. But as I
have said, this is the one Dickens work of which the date <i>is</i>
essential. It is really an important part of the criticism of this book
to say that it is his first book. Certain elements of clumsiness, of
obviousness, of evident blunder, actually require the chronological
explanation. It is biographically important that this is his first book,
almost exactly in the same way that it is biographically important that
<i>The Mystery of Edwin Drood</i> was his last book. Change or no change,
<i>Edwin Drood</i> has this plain point of a last story about it: that it is
not finished. But if the last book is unfinished, the first book is more
unfinished still.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
The <i>Sketches</i> divide themselves, of course, into two broad classes. One
half consists of sketches that are truly and in the strict sense
sketches. That is, they are things that have no story and in their
outline none of the character of creation; they are merely facts from
the street or the tavern or the town hall, noted down as they occurred
by an intelligence of quite exceptional vivacity. The second class
consists of purely creative things: farces, romances, stories in any
case with a non-natural perfection, or a poetical justice, to round them
off. One class is admirably represented, for instance, by the sketch
describing the Charity Dinner, the other by such a story as that of
<i>Horatio Sparkins</i>. These things were almost certainly written by
Dickens at very various periods of his youth; and early as the harvest
is, no doubt it is a harvest and had ripened during a reasonably long
time. Nevertheless it is with these two types of narrative that the
young Charles Dickens first enters English literature; he enters it with
a number of journalistic notes of such things as he has seen happen in
streets or offices, and with a number of short stories which err on the
side of the extravagant and even the superficial. Journalism had not
then, indeed, sunk to the low level which it has since reached. His
sketches of dirty London would not have been dirty enough for the modern
Imperialist press. Still these first efforts of his are journalism, and
sometimes vulgar journalism. It was as a journalist that he attacked the
world, as a journalist that he conquered it.</p>

<p>The biographical circumstances will not, of course, be forgotten. The
life of Dickens had been a curious one. Brought up in a family just poor
enough to be painfully <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
conscious of its prosperity and its respectability, he had been
suddenly flung by a financial calamity into a social condition far below
his own. For men on that exact edge of the educated class such a
transition is really tragic. A duke may become a navvy for a joke, but a
clerk cannot become a navvy for a joke. Dickens&rsquo;s parents went to
a debtors&rsquo; prison; Dickens himself went to a far more unpleasant
place. The debtors&rsquo; prison had about it at least that element of
amiable compromise and kindly decay which belonged (and belongs still)
to all the official institutions of England. But Dickens was doomed to
see the very blackest aspect of nineteenth-century England, something
far blacker than any mere bad government. He went not to a prison but to
a factory. In the musty traditionalism of the Marshalsea old John
Dickens could easily remain optimistic. In the ferocious efficiency of
the modern factory young Charles Dickens narrowly escaped being a
pessimist. He did escape this danger; finally he even escaped the
factory itself. His next step in life was, if possible, even more
eccentric. He was sent to school; he was sent off like an innocent
little boy in Eton collars to learn the rudiments of Latin grammar,
without any reference to the fact that he had already taken his part in
the horrible competition and actuality of the age of manufactures. It
was like giving a sacked bank manager a satchel and sending him to a
dame&rsquo;s school. Nor was the third stage of this career unconnected
with the oddity of the others. On leaving the school he was made a clerk
in a lawyer&rsquo;s office, as if henceforward this child of ridiculous
changes was to settle down into a silent assistant for a quiet
solicitor. It was exactly <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
at this moment that his fundamental rebellion began to seethe; it
seethed more against the quiet finality of his legal occupation than it
had seethed against the squalor and slavery of his days of poverty.
There must have been in his mind, I think, a dim feeling: &ldquo;Did all
my dark crises mean only this; was I crucified only that I might become
a solicitor&rsquo;s clerk?&rdquo; Whatever be the truth about this
conjecture there can be no question about the facts themselves. It was
about this time that he began to burst and bubble over, to insist upon
his own intellect, to claim a career. It was about this time that he put
together a loose pile of papers, satires on institutions, pictures of
private persons, fairy tales of the vulgarity of his world, odds and
ends such as come out of the facility and the fierce vanity of youth. It
was about this time at any rate that he decided to publish them, and
gave them the name of <i>Sketches by Boz</i>.</p>

<p>They must, I think, be read in the light of this youthful explosion. In
some psychological sense he had really been wronged. But he had only
become conscious of his wrongs as his wrongs had been gradually righted.
Similarly, it has often been found that a man who can patiently endure
penal servitude through a judicial blunder will nevertheless, when once
his cause is well asserted, quarrel about the amount of compensation or
complain of small slights in his professional existence. These are the
marks of the first literary action of Dickens. It has in it all the
peculiar hardness of youth; a hardness which in those who have in any
way been unfairly treated reaches even to impudence. It is a terrible
thing for any man to find out that his elders <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
are wrong. And this almost unkindly courage of youth must partly be
held responsible for the smartness of Dickens, that almost offensive
smartness which in these earlier books of his sometimes irritates us
like the showy gibes in the tall talk of a school-boy. These first pages
bear witness both to the energy of his genius and also to its
unenlightenment; he seems more ignorant and more cocksure than so great
a man should be. Dickens was never stupid, but he was sometimes silly;
and he is occasionally silly here.</p>

<p>All this must be said to prepare the more fastidious modern for these
papers, if he has never read them before. But when all this has been
said there remains in them exactly what always remains in Dickens when
you have taken away everything that can be taken away by the most
fastidious modern who ever dissected his grandmother. There remains that
<i>primum mobile</i> of which all the mystics have spoken: energy, the power
to create. I will not call it &ldquo;the will to live,&rdquo; for that
is a priggish phrase of German professors. Even German professors, I
suppose, have the will to live. But Dickens had exactly what German
professors have not: he had the power to live. And indeed it is most
valuable to have these early specimens of the Dickens work if only
because they are specimens of his spirit apart from his matured
intelligence. It is well to be able to realise that contact with the
Dickens world is almost like a physical contact; it is like stepping
suddenly into the hot smells of a greenhouse, or into the bleak smell of
the sea. We know that we are there. Let any one read, for instance, one
of the foolish but amusing farces in Dickens&rsquo;s first volume. Let
him <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
read, for instance, such a story as that of <i>Horatio Sparkins</i> or that
of <i>The Tuggses at Ramsgate</i>. He will not find very much of that verbal
felicity or fantastic irony that Dickens afterwards developed; the
incidents are upon the plain lines of the stock comedy of the day:
sharpers who entrap simpletons, spinsters who angle for husbands, youths
who try to look Byronic and only look foolish. Yet there is something in
these stories which there is not in the ordinary stock comedies of that
day: an indefinable flavour of emphasis and richness, a hint as of
infinity of fun. Doubtless, for instance, a million comic writers of
that epoch had made game of the dark, romantic young man who pretended
to abysses of philosophy and despair. And it is not easy to say exactly
why we feel that the few metaphysical remarks of Mr. Horatio Sparkins
are in some way really much funnier than any of those old stock jokes.
It is in a certain quality of deep enjoyment in the writer as well as
the reader; as if the few words written had been dipped in dark nonsense
and were, as it were, reeking with derision. &ldquo;Because if Effect be
the result of Cause and Cause be the Precursor of Effect,&rdquo; said
Mr. Horatio Sparkins, &ldquo;I apprehend that you are wrong.&rdquo;
Nobody can get at the real secret of sentences like that; sentences
which were afterwards strewed with reckless liberality over the
conversation of Dick Swiveller or Mr. Mantalini, Sim Tappertit or Mr.
Pecksniff. Though the joke seems most superficial one has only to read
it a certain number of times to see that it is most subtle. The joke
does not lie in Mr. Sparkins merely using long words, any more than the
joke lies merely in Mr. Swiveller drinking, or in Mr. Mantalini
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
deceiving his wife. It is something in the arrangement of the words;
something in a last inspired turn of absurdity given to a sentence. In
spite of everything Horatio Sparkins is funny. We cannot tell why he is
funny. When we know why he is funny we shall know why Dickens is great.</p>

<p>Standing as we do here upon the threshold, as it were, of the work of
Dickens, it may be well perhaps to state this truth as being, after all,
the most important one. This first work had, as I have said, the faults
of first work and the special faults that arose from its author&rsquo;s
accidental history; he was deprived of education, and therefore it was
in some ways uneducated; he was confronted with the folly and failure of
his natural superiors and guardians, and therefore it was in some ways
pert and insolent. Nevertheless the main fact about the work is worth
stating here for any reader who should follow the chronological order
and read the <i>Sketches by Boz</i> before embarking on the stormy and
splendid sea of <i>Pickwick</i>. For the sea of <i>Pickwick</i>, though splendid,
does make some people seasick. The great point to be emphasised at such
an initiation is this: that people, especially refined people, are not
to judge of Dickens by what they would call the coarseness or
commonplaceness of his subject. It is quite true that his jokes are
often on the same <i>subjects</i> as the jokes in a halfpenny comic paper.
Only they happen to be good jokes. He does make jokes about drunkenness,
jokes about mothers-in-law, jokes about henpecked husbands, jokes (which
is much more really unpardonable) about spinsters, jokes about physical
cowardice, jokes about fatness, jokes about sitting down on one&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
hat. He does make fun of all these things; and the reason is not very
far to seek. He makes fun of all these things because all these things,
or nearly all of them, are really very funny. But a large number of
those who might otherwise read and enjoy Dickens are undoubtedly
&ldquo;put off&rdquo; (as the phrase goes) by the fact that he seems to
be echoing a poor kind of claptrap in his choice of incidents and
images. Partly, of course, he suffers from the very fact of his success;
his play with these topics was so good that every one else has played
with them increasingly since; he may indeed have copied the old jokes,
but he certainly renewed them. For instance, &ldquo;Ally Sloper&rdquo;
was certainly copied from Wilkins Micawber. To this day you may see (in
the front page of that fine periodical) the bald head and the high shirt
collar that betray the high original from which &ldquo;Ally
Sloper&rdquo; is derived. But exactly because &ldquo;Sloper&rdquo; was
stolen from Micawber, for that very reason the new generation feels as
if Micawber were stolen from &ldquo;Sloper.&rdquo; Many modern readers
feel as if Dickens were copying the comic papers, whereas in truth the
comic papers are still copying Dickens.</p>

<p>Dickens showed himself to be an original man by always accepting old and
established topics. There is no clearer sign of the absence of
originality among modern poets than their disposition to find new
themes. Really original poets write poems about the spring. They are
always fresh, just as the spring is always fresh. Men wholly without
originality write poems about torture, or new religions, of some
perversion of obscenity, hoping that the mere sting of the subject may
speak for them. But we do not sufficiently realise <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
that what is true of the classic ode is also true of the classic joke.
A true poet writes about the spring being beautiful because (after a
thousand springs) the spring really is beautiful. In the same way the
true humourist writes about a man sitting down on his hat, because the
act of sitting down on one&rsquo;s hat (however often and however
admirably performed) really is extremely funny. We must not dismiss a
new poet because his poem is called <i>To a Skylark</i>; nor must we dismiss
a humourist because his new farce is called <i>My Mother-in-law</i>. He may
really have splendid and inspiring things to say upon an eternal
problem. The whole question is whether he has.</p>

<p>Now this is exactly where Dickens, and the possible mistake about
Dickens, both come in. Numbers of sensitive ladies, numbers of simple
&aelig;sthetes, have had a vague shrinking from that element in Dickens which
begins vaguely in <i>The Tuggses at Ramsgate</i> and culminates in
<i>Pickwick</i>. They have a vague shrinking from the mere subject matter;
from the mere fact that so much of the fun is about drinking or
fighting, or falling down, or eloping with old ladies. It is to these
that the first appeal must be made upon the threshold of Dickens
criticism. Let them really read the thing and really see whether the
humour is the gross and half-witted jeering which they imagine it to be.
It is exactly here that the whole genius of Dickens is concerned. His
subjects are indeed stock subjects; like the skylark of Shelley, or the
autumn of Keats. But all the more because they are stock subjects the
reader realises what a magician is at work. The notion of a clumsy
fellow who falls off his horse is indeed a stock <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
and stale subject. But Mr. Winkle is not a stock and stale subject. Nor
is his horse a stock and stale subject; it is as immortal as the horses
of Achilles. The notion of a fat old gentleman proud of his legs might
easily be vulgar. But Mr. Pickwick proud of his legs is not vulgar;
somehow we feel that they were legs to be proud of. And it is exactly
this that we must look for in these <i>Sketches</i>. We must not leap to any
cheap fancy that they are low farces. Rather we must see that they are
not low farces; and see that nobody but Dickens could have prevented
them from being so.</p>

<h2><a name="PICKWICK" id="PICKWICK"></a>PICKWICK PAPERS</h2>

<p>There are those who deny with enthusiasm the existence of a God and are
happy in a hobby which they call the Mistakes of Moses. I have not
studied their labours in detail, but it seems that the chief mistake of
Moses was that he neglected to write the Pentateuch. The lesser errors,
apparently, were not made by Moses, but by another person equally
unknown. These controversialists cover the very widest field, and their
attacks upon Scripture are varied to the point of wildness. They range
from the proposition that the unexpurgated Bible is almost as unfit for
an American girls&rsquo; school as is an unexpurgated Shakespeare; they
descend to the proposition that kissing the Book is almost as
hygienically dangerous as kissing the babies of the poor. A superficial
critic might well imagine that there was not one single sentence left of
the Hebrew or Christian Scriptures which this school had not marked with
some ingenious and uneducated comment. But there is one passage at least
upon which they have never pounced, at least to my knowledge; and in
pointing it out to them I feel that I am, or ought to be, providing
material for quite a multitude of Hyde Park orations. I mean that
singular arrangement in the mystical account <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
of the Creation by which light is created first and all the luminous
bodies afterwards. One could not imagine a process more open to the
elephantine logic of the Bible-smasher than this: that the sun should be
created after the sunlight. The conception that lies at the back of the
phrase is indeed profoundly antagonistic to much of the modern point of
view. To many modern people it would sound like saying that foliage
existed before the first leaf; it would sound like saying that childhood
existed before a baby was born. The idea is, as I have said, alien to
most modern thought, and like many other ideas which are alien to most
modern thought, it is a very subtle and a very sound idea. Whatever be
the meaning of the passage in the actual primeval poem, there is a very
real metaphysical meaning in the idea that light existed before the sun
and stars. It is not barbaric; it is rather Platonic. The idea existed
before any of the machinery which made manifest the idea. Justice
existed when there was no need of judges, and mercy existed before any
man was oppressed.</p>

<p>However this may be in the matter of religion and philosophy, it can be
said with little exaggeration that this truth is the very key of
literature. The whole difference between construction and creation is
exactly this: that a thing constructed can only be loved after it is
constructed; but a thing created is loved before it exists, as the
mother can love the unborn child. In creative art the essence of a book
exists before the book or before even the details or main features of
the book; the author enjoys it and lives in it with a kind of prophetic
rapture. He wishes to write a comic <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
story before he has thought of a single comic incident. He desires to
write a sad story before he has thought of anything sad. He knows the
atmosphere before he knows anything. There is a low priggish maxim
sometimes uttered by men so frivolous as to take humour
seriously&mdash;a maxim that a man should not laugh at his own jokes.
But the great artist not only laughs at his own jokes; he laughs at his
own jokes before he has made them. In the case of a man really humorous
we can see humour in his eye before he has thought of any amusing words
at all. So the creative writer laughs at his comedy before he creates
it, and he has tears for his tragedy before he knows what it is. When
the symbols and the fulfilling facts do come to him, they come generally
in a manner very fragmentary and inverted, mostly in irrational glimpses
of crisis or consummation. The last page comes before the first; before
his romance has begun, he knows that it has ended well. He sees the
wedding before the wooing; he sees the death before the duel. But most
of all he sees the colour and character of the whole story prior to any
possible events in it. This is the real argument for art and style, only
that the artists and the stylists have not the sense to use it. In one
very real sense style is far more important than either character or
narrative. For a man knows what style of book he wants to write when he
knows nothing else about it.</p>

<p><i>Pickwick</i> is in Dickens&rsquo;s career the mere mass of light before
the creation of sun or moon. It is the splendid, shapeless substance of
which all his stars were ultimately made. You might split up <i>Pickwick</i>
into innumerable novels as you could split up that primeval <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
light into innumerable solar systems. The <i>Pickwick Papers</i> constitute
first and foremost a kind of wild promise, a pre-natal vision of all the
children of Dickens. He had not yet settled down into the plain,
professional habit of picking out a plot and characters, of attending to
one thing at a time, of writing a separate, sensible novel and sending
it off to his publishers. He is still in the youthful whirl of the kind
of world that he would like to create. He has not yet really settled
what story he will write, but only what sort of story he will write. He
tries to tell ten stories at once; he pours into the pot all the chaotic
fancies and crude experiences of his boyhood; he sticks in irrelevant
short stories shamelessly, as into a scrap-book; he adopts designs and
abandons them, begins episodes and leaves them unfinished; but from the
first page to the last there is a nameless and elemental
ecstasy&mdash;that of the man who is doing the kind of thing that he can
do. Dickens, like every other honest and effective writer, came at last
to some degree of care and self-restraint. He learned how to make his
<i>dramatis person&aelig;</i> assist his drama; he learned how to write
stories which were full of rambling and perversity, but which were
stories. But before he wrote a single real story, he had a kind of
vision. It was a vision of the Dickens world&mdash;a maze of white
roads, a map full of fantastic towns, thundering coaches, clamorous
market-places, uproarious inns, strange and swaggering figures. That
vision was <i>Pickwick</i>.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that this is true even in connection with the
man&rsquo;s contemporaneous biography. Apart from anything else about
it, <i>Pickwick</i> was his <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
first great chance. It was a big commission given in some sense to an
untried man, that he might show what he could do. It was in a strict
sense a sample. And just as a sample of leather can be only a piece of
leather, or a sample of coal a lump of coal, so this book may most
properly be regarded as simply a lump of Dickens. He was anxious to show
all that was in him. He was more concerned to prove that he could write
well than to prove that he could write this particular book well. And he
did prove this, at any rate. No one ever sent such a sample as the
sample of Dickens. His roll of leather blocked up the street; his lump
of coal set the Thames on fire.</p>

<p>The book originated in the suggestion of a publisher; as many more good
books have done than the arrogance of the man of letters is commonly
inclined to admit. Very much is said in our time about Apollo and
Admetus, and the impossibility of asking genius to work within
prescribed limits or assist an alien design. But after all, as a matter
of fact, some of the greatest geniuses have done it, from Shakespeare
botching up bad comedies and dramatising bad novels down to Dickens
writing a masterpiece as the mere framework for a Mr. Seymour&rsquo;s
sketches. Nor is the true explanation irrelevant to the spirit and power
of Dickens. Very delicate, slender, and <i>bizarre</i> talents are indeed
incapable of being used for an outside purpose, whether of public good
or of private gain. But about very great and rich talent there goes a
certain disdainful generosity which can turn its hand to anything. Minor
poets cannot write to order; but very great poets can write to order.
The larger the man&rsquo;s mind, the wider <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
his scope of vision, the more likely it will be that anything suggested
to him will seem significant and promising; the more he has a grasp of
everything the more ready he will be to write anything. It is very hard
(if that is the question) to throw a brick at a man and ask him to write
an epic; but the more he is a great man the more able he will be to
write about the brick. It is very unjust (if that is all) to point to a
hoarding of Colman&rsquo;s mustard and demand a flood of philosophical
eloquence; but the greater the man is the more likely he will be to give
it to you. So it was proved, not for the first time, in this great
experiment of the early employment of Dickens. Messrs. Chapman and Hall
came to him with a scheme for a string of sporting stories to serve as
the context, and one might almost say the excuse, for a string of
sketches by Seymour, the sporting artist. Dickens made some
modifications in the plan, but he adopted its main feature; and its main
feature was Mr. Winkle. To think of what Mr. Winkle might have been in
the hands of a dull <i>farceur</i>, and then to think of what he is, is to
experience the feeling that Dickens made a man out of rags and refuse.
Dickens was to work splendidly and successfully in many fields, and to
send forth many brilliant books and brave figures. He was destined to
have the applause of continents like a statesman, and to dictate to his
publishers like a despot; but perhaps he never worked again so supremely
well as here, where he worked in chains. It may well be questioned
whether his one hack book is not his masterpiece.</p>

<p>Of course it is true that as he went on his independence increased, and
he kicked quite free of the influences <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
that had suggested his story. So Shakespeare declared his independence
of the original chronicle of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, eliminating
altogether (with some wisdom) another uncle called Wiglerus. At the
start the Nimrod Club of Chapman and Hall may have even had equal
chances with the Pickwick Club of young Mr. Dickens; but the Pickwick
Club became something much better than any publisher had dared to dream
of. Some of the old links were indeed severed by accident or extraneous
trouble; Seymour, for whose sake the whole had perhaps been planned,
blew his brains out before he had drawn ten pictures. But such things
were trifles compared to <i>Pickwick</i> itself. It mattered little now
whether Seymour blew his brains out, so long as Charles Dickens blew his
brains in. The work became systematically and progressively more
powerful and masterly. Many critics have commented on the somewhat
discordant and inartistic change between the earlier part of <i>Pickwick</i>
and the later; they have pointed out, not without good sense, that the
character of Mr. Pickwick changes from that of a silly buffoon to that
of a solid merchant. But the case, if these critics had noticed it, is
much stronger in the minor characters of the great company. Mr. Winkle,
who has been an idiot (even, perhaps, as Mr. Pickwick says, &ldquo;an
impostor&rdquo;), suddenly becomes a romantic and even reckless lover,
scaling a forbidden wall and planning a bold elopement. Mr. Snodgrass,
who has behaved in a ridiculous manner in all serious positions,
suddenly finds himself in a ridiculous position&mdash;that of a
gentleman surprised in a secret love affair&mdash;and behaves in a
manner perfectly manly, serious, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
and honourable. Mr. Tupman alone has no serious emotional development,
and for this reason it is, presumably, that we hear less and less of Mr.
Tupman towards the end of the book. Dickens has by this time got into a
thoroughly serious mood&mdash;a mood expressed indeed by extravagant
incidents, but none the less serious for that; and into this Winkle and
Snodgrass, in the character of romantic lovers, could be made to fit.
Mr. Tupman had to be left out of the love affairs; therefore Mr. Tupman
is left out of the book.</p>

<p>Much of the change was due to the entrance of the greatest character in
the story. It may seem strange at the first glance to say that Sam
Weller helped to make the story serious. Nevertheless, this is strictly
true. The introduction of Sam Weller had, to begin with, some merely
accidental and superficial effects. When Samuel Weller had appeared,
Samuel Pickwick was no longer the chief farcical character. Weller
became the joker and Pickwick in some sense the butt of his jokes. Thus
it was obvious that the more simple, solemn, and really respectable this
butt could be made the better. Mr. Pickwick had been the figure capering
before the footlights. But with the advent of Sam, Mr. Pickwick had
become a sort of black background and had to behave as such. But this
explanation, though true as far as it goes, is a mean and unsatisfactory
one, leaving the great elements unexplained. For a much deeper and more
righteous reason Sam Weller introduces the more serious tone of
Pickwick. He introduces it because he introduces something which it was
the chief business of Dickens to preach throughout his life&mdash;something
which he never preached so well as when he preached
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
it unconsciously. Sam Weller introduces the English people.</p>

<p>Sam Weller is the great symbol in English literature of the populace
peculiar to England. His incessant stream of sane nonsense is a
wonderful achievement of Dickens: but it is no great falsification of
the incessant stream of sane nonsense as it really exists among the
English poor. The English poor live in an atmosphere of humour; they
think in humour. Irony is the very air that they breathe. A joke comes
suddenly from time to time into the head of a politician or a gentleman,
and then as a rule he makes the most of it; but when a serious word
comes into the mind of a coster it is almost as startling as a joke. The
word &ldquo;chaff&rdquo; was, I suppose, originally applied to badinage
to express its barren and unsustaining character; but to the English
poor chaff is as sustaining as grain. The phrase that leaps to their
lips is the ironical phrase. I remember once being driven in a hansom
cab down a street that turned out to be a <i>cul de sac</i>, and brought us
bang up against a wall. The driver and I simultaneously said something.
But I said: &ldquo;This&rsquo;ll never do!&rdquo; and he said:
&ldquo;This is all right!&rdquo; Even in the act of pulling back his
horse&rsquo;s nose from a brick wall, that confirmed satirist thought in
terms of his highly-trained and traditional satire; while I, belonging
to a duller and simpler class, expressed my feelings in words as
innocent and literal as those of a rustic or a child.</p>

<p>This eternal output of divine derision has never been so truly typified
as by the character of Sam; he is a grotesque fountain which gushes the
living waters <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
for ever. Dickens is accused of exaggeration and he is often guilty of
exaggeration; but here he does not exaggerate: he merely symbolises and
sublimates like any other great artist. Sam Weller does not exaggerate
the wit of the London street arab one atom more than Colonel Newcome,
let us say, exaggerates the stateliness of an ordinary soldier and
gentleman, or than Mr. Collins exaggerates the fatuity of a certain kind
of country clergyman. And this breath from the boisterous brotherhood of
the poor lent a special seriousness and smell of reality to the whole
story. The unconscious follies of Winkle and Tupman are blown away like
leaves before the solid and conscious folly of Sam Weller. Moreover, the
relations between Pickwick and his servant Sam are in some ways new and
valuable in literature. Many comic writers had described the clever
rascal and his ridiculous dupe; but here, in a fresh and very human
atmosphere, we have a clever servant who was not a rascal and
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note: The original showed 'a dupe and who was'.">a dupe who was</ins>
not ridiculous. Sam Weller stands in some ways for a cheerful knowledge
of the world; Mr. Pickwick stands for a still more cheerful ignorance of
the world. And Dickens responded to a profound human sentiment (the
sentiment that has made saints and the sanctity of children) when he
made the gentler and less-travelled type&mdash;the type which moderates
and controls. Knowledge and innocence are both excellent things, and
they are both very funny. But it is right that knowledge should be the
servant and innocence the master.</p>

<p>The sincerity of this study of Sam Weller has produced one particular
effect in the book which I wonder <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
that critics of Dickens have never noticed or discussed. Because it has
no Dickens &ldquo;pathos,&rdquo; certain parts of it are truly pathetic.
Dickens, realising rightly that the whole tone of the book was fun, felt
that he ought to keep out of it any great experiments in sadness and
keep within limits those that he put in. He used this restraint in order
not to spoil the humour; but (if he had known himself better) he might
well have used it in order not to spoil the pathos. This is the one book
in which Dickens was, as it were, forced to trample down his tender
feelings; and for that very reason it is the one book where all the
tenderness there is is quite unquestionably true. An admirable example
of what I mean may be found in the scene in which Sam Weller goes down
to see his bereaved father after the death of his step-mother. The most
loyal admirer of Dickens can hardly prevent himself from giving a slight
shudder when he thinks of what Dickens might have made of that scene in
some of his more expansive and maudlin moments. For all I know old Mrs.
Weller might have asked what the wild waves were saying; and for all I
know old Mr. Weller might have told her. As it is, Dickens, being forced
to keep the tale taut and humorous, gives a picture of humble respect
and decency which is manly, dignified, and really sad. There is no
attempt made by these simple and honest men, the father and son, to
pretend that the dead woman was anything greatly other than she was;
their respect is for death, and for the human weakness and mystery which
it must finally cover. Old Tony Weller does not tell his shrewish wife
that she is already a white-winged <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
angel; he speaks to her with an admirable good nature and good sense:</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Susan,&rsquo; I says, &lsquo;you&rsquo;ve been a wery
good vife to me altogether: keep a good heart, my dear, and
you&rsquo;ll live to see me punch that &rsquo;ere Stiggins&rsquo;s
&rsquo;ead yet.&rsquo; She smiled at this, Samivel ... but she died
arter all.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>That is perhaps the first and the last time that Dickens ever touched
the extreme dignity of pathos. He is restraining his compassion, and
afterwards he let it go. Now laughter is a thing that can be let go;
laughter has in it a quality of liberty. But sorrow has in it by its
very nature a quality of confinement; pathos by its very nature fights
with itself. Humour is expansive; it bursts outwards; the fact is
attested by the common expression, &ldquo;holding one&rsquo;s
sides.&rdquo; But sorrow is not expansive; and it was afterwards the
mistake of Dickens that he tried to make it expansive. It is the one
great weakness of Dickens as a great writer, that he did try to make
that sudden sadness, that abrupt pity, which we call pathos, a thing
quite obvious, infectious, public, as if it were journalism or the
measles. It is pleasant to think that in this supreme masterpiece, done
in the dawn of his career, there is not even this faint fleck upon the
sun of his just splendour. Pickwick will always be remembered as the
great example of everything that made Dickens great; of the solemn
conviviality of great friendships, of the erratic adventures of old
English roads, of the hospitality of old English inns, of the great
fundamental kindliness and honour of old English manners. First of all,
however, it will always be remembered for its laughter, or, if you will,
for its folly. A good joke is the one ultimate and sacred thing which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
cannot be criticised. Our relations with a good joke are direct and
even divine relations. We speak of &ldquo;seeing&rdquo; a joke just as
we speak of &ldquo;seeing&rdquo; a ghost or a vision. If we have seen
it, it is futile to argue with us; and we have seen the vision of
<i>Pickwick</i>. <i>Pickwick</i> may be the top of Dickens&rsquo;s humour; I think
upon the whole it is. But the broad humour of <i>Pickwick</i> he broadened
over many wonderful kingdoms; the narrow pathos of <i>Pickwick</i> he never
found again.</p>

<p>Romance is perhaps the highest point of human expression, except indeed
religion, to which it is closely allied. Romance resembles religion
especially in this, that it is not only a simplification but a
shortening of existence. Both romance and religion see everything as it
were foreshortened; they see everything in an abrupt and fantastic
perspective, coming to an apex. It is the whole essence of perspective
that it comes to a point. Similarly, religion comes to a point&mdash;to the
point. Thus religion is always insisting on the shortness of human life.
But it does not insist on the shortness of human life as the pessimists
insist on it. Pessimism insists on the shortness of human life in order
to show that life is valueless. Religion insists on the shortness of
human life in order to show that life is frightfully valuable&mdash;is almost
horribly valuable. Pessimism says that life is so short that it gives
nobody a chance; religion says that life is so short that it gives
everybody his final chance. In the first case the word brevity means
futility; in the second case, opportunity. But the case is even stronger
than this. Religion shortens everything. Religion shortens even
eternity. Where science, submitting to the false standard of time, sees
evolution, which is slow, religion sees creation, which is sudden.
Philosophically speaking, the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
process is neither slow nor quick since we have nothing to compare it
with. Religion prefers to think of it as quick. For religion the flowers
shoot up suddenly like rockets. For religion the mountains are lifted up
suddenly like waves. Those who quote that fine passage which says that
in God&rsquo;s sight a thousand years are as yesterday that is passed as
a watch in the night, do not realise the full force of the meaning. To
God a thousand years are not only a watch but an exciting watch. For God
time goes at a gallop, as it does to a man reading a good tale.</p>

<p>All this is, in a humble manner, true for romance. Romance is a
shortening and sharpening of the human difficulty. Where you and I have
to vote against a man, or write (rather feebly) against a man, or sign
illegible petitions against a man, romance does for him what we should
really like to see done. It knocks him down; it shortens the slow
process of historical justice. All romances consist of three characters.
Other characters may be introduced; but those other characters are
certainly mere scenery as far as the romance is concerned. They are
bushes that wave rather excitedly; they are posts that stand up with a
certain pride; they are correctly painted rocks that frown very
correctly; but they are all landscape&mdash;they are all a background. In
every pure romance there are three living and moving characters. For the
sake of argument they may be called St. George and the Dragon and the
Princess. In every romance there must be the twin elements of loving and
fighting. In every romance there must be the three characters: there
must be the Princess, who is a thing to be loved; there must
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
be the Dragon, who is a thing to be fought; and there must be St.
George, who is a thing that both loves and fights. There have been many
symptoms of cynicism and decay in our modern civilisation. But of all
the signs of modern feebleness, of lack of grasp on morals as they
actually must be, there has been none quite so silly or so dangerous as
this: that the philosophers of to-day have started to divide loving from
fighting and to put them into opposite camps. There could be no worse
sign than that a man, even Nietzsche, can be found to say that we should
go in for fighting instead of loving. There can be no worse sign than
that a man, even Tolstoi, can be found to tell us that we should go in
for loving instead of fighting. The two things imply each other; they
implied each other in the old romance and in the old religion, which
were the two permanent things of humanity. You cannot love a thing
without wanting to fight for it. You cannot fight without something to
fight for. To love a thing without wishing to fight for it is not love
at all; it is lust. It may be an airy, philosophical, and disinterested
lust; it may be, so to speak, a virgin lust; but it is lust, because it
is wholly self-indulgent and invites no attack. On the other hand,
fighting for a thing without loving it is not even fighting; it can only
be called a kind of horse-play that is occasionally fatal. Wherever
human nature is human and unspoilt by any special sophistry, there
exists this natural kinship between war and wooing, and that natural
kinship is called romance. It comes upon a man especially in the great
hour of youth; and every man who has ever been young at all has felt, if
only for a moment, this ultimate and poetic paradox. He
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
knows that loving the world is the same thing as fighting the world. It
was at the very moment when he offered to like everybody he also offered
to hit everybody. To almost every man that can be called a man this
especial moment of the romantic culmination has come. In the first
resort the man wished to live a romance. In the second resort, in the
last and worst resort, he was content to write one.</p>

<p>Now there is a certain moment when this element enters independently
into the life of Dickens. There is a particular time when we can see him
suddenly realise that he wants to write a romance and nothing else. In
reading his letters, in appreciating his character, this point emerges
clearly enough. He was full of the afterglow of his marriage; he was
still young and psychologically ignorant; above all, he was now, really
for the first time, sure that he was going to be at least some kind of
success. There is, I repeat, a certain point at which one feels that
Dickens will either begin to write romances or go off on something
different altogether. This crucial point in his life is marked by
<i>Nicholas Nickleby</i>.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that before this issue of <i>Nicholas Nickleby</i> his
work, successful as it was, had not been such as to dedicate him
seriously or irrevocably to the writing of novels. He had already
written three books; and at least two of them are classed among the
novels under his name. But if we look at the actual origin and formation
of these books we see that they came from another source and were really
designed upon another plan. The three books were, of course, the
<i>Sketches by Boz</i>, <i>the Pickwick Papers</i>, and <i>Oliver Twist</i>.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
It is, I suppose, sufficiently well understood that the <i>Sketches by
Boz</i> are, as their name implies, only sketches. But surely it is quite
equally clear that the <i>Pickwick Papers</i> are, as their name implies,
merely papers. Nor is the case at all different in spirit and essence
when we come to <i>Oliver Twist</i>. There is indeed a sort of romance in
<i>Oliver Twist</i>, but it is such an uncommonly bad one that it can hardly
be regarded as greatly interrupting the previous process; and if the
reader chooses to pay very little attention to it, he cannot pay less
attention to it than the author did. But in fact the case lies far
deeper. <i>Oliver Twist</i> is so much apart from the ordinary track of
Dickens, it is so gloomy, it is so much all in one atmosphere, that it
can best be considered as an exception or a solitary excursus in his
work. Perhaps it can best be considered as the extension of one of his
old sketches, of some sketch that happened to be about a visit to a
workhouse or a gaol. In the <i>Sketches by Boz</i> he might well have visited
a workhouse where he saw Bumble; in the <i>Sketches by Boz</i> he might well
have visited a prison where he saw Fagin. We are still in the realm of
sketches and sketchiness. <i>The Pickwick Papers</i> may be called an
extension of one of his bright sketches. <i>Oliver Twist</i> may be called an
extension of one of his gloomy ones.</p>

<p>Had he continued along this line all his books might very well have been
note-books. It would be very easy to split up all his subsequent books
into scraps and episodes, such as those which make up the <i>Sketches by
Boz</i>. It would be easy enough for Dickens, instead of publishing
<i>Nicholas Nickleby</i>, to have published a book of sketches, one of which
was called &ldquo;A Yorkshire<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
School,&rdquo; another called &ldquo;A Provincial Theatre,&rdquo; and
another called &ldquo;Sir Mulberry Hawk or High Life Revealed,&rdquo;
another called &ldquo;Mrs. Nickleby or a Lady&rsquo;s Monologue.&rdquo;
It would have been very easy to have thrown over the rather chaotic plan
of the <i>Old Curiosity Shop</i>. He might have merely written short stories
called &ldquo;The Glorious Apollos,&rdquo; &ldquo;Mrs. Quilp&rsquo;s
Tea-Party,&rdquo; &ldquo;Mrs. Jarley&rsquo;s Waxwork,&rdquo; &ldquo;The
Little Servant,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Death of a Dwarf.&rdquo; <i>Martin
Chuzzlewit</i> might have been twenty stories instead of one story. <i>Dombey
and Son</i> might have been twenty stories instead of one story. We might
have lost all Dickens&rsquo;s novels; we might have lost altogether
Dickens the novelist. We might have lost that steady love of a seminal
and growing romance which grew on him steadily as the years advanced,
and which gave us towards the end some of his greatest triumphs. All his
books might have been <i>Sketches by Boz</i>. But he did turn away from this,
and the turning-point is <i>Nicholas Nickleby</i>.</p>

<p>Everything has a supreme moment and is crucial; that is where our
friends the evolutionists go wrong. I suppose that there is an instant
of midsummer as there is an instant of midnight. If in the same way
there is a supreme point of spring, <i>Nicholas Nickleby</i> is the supreme
point of Dickens&rsquo;s spring. I do not mean that it is the best book
that he wrote in his youth. <i>Pickwick</i> is a better book. I do not mean
that it contains more striking characters than any of the other books in
his youth. The <i>Old Curiosity Shop</i> contains at least two more striking
characters. But I mean that this book coincided with his resolution to
be a great novelist and his final belief that he could be one.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
Henceforward his books are novels, very commonly bad novels. Previously
they have not really been novels at all. There are many indications of
the change I mean. Here is one, for instance, which is more or less
final. <i>Nicholas Nickleby</i> is Dickens&rsquo;s first romantic novel
because it is his first novel with a proper and dignified romantic hero;
which means, of course, a somewhat chivalrous young donkey. The hero of
<i>Pickwick</i> is an old man. The hero of <i>Oliver Twist</i> is a child. Even
after <i>Nicholas Nickleby</i> this non-romantic custom continued. The <i>Old
Curiosity Shop</i> has no hero in particular. The hero of <i>Barnaby Rudge</i>
is a lunatic. But Nicholas Nickleby is a proper, formal, and ceremonial
hero. He has no psychology; he has not even any particular character;
but he is made deliberately a hero&mdash;young, poor, brave, unimpeachable,
and ultimately triumphant. He is, in short, the hero. Mr. Vincent
Crummles had a colossal intellect; and I always have a fancy that under
all his pomposity he saw things more keenly than he allowed others to
see. The moment he saw Nicholas Nickleby, almost in rags and limping
along the high road, he engaged him (you will remember) as first walking
gentleman. He was right. Nobody could possibly be more of a first
walking gentleman than Nicholas Nickleby was. He was the first walking
gentleman before he went on to the boards of Mr. Vincent
Crummles&rsquo;s theatre, and he remained the first walking gentleman
after he had come off.</p>

<p>Now this romantic method involves a certain element of climax which to
us appears crudity. Nicholas Nickleby, for instance, wanders through the
world; he <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
takes a situation as assistant to a Yorkshire schoolmaster; he sees an
act of tyranny of which he strongly disapproves; he cries out
&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; in a voice that makes the rafters ring; he thrashes
the schoolmaster within an inch of his life; he throws the schoolmaster
away like an old cigar, and he goes away. The modern intellect is
positively prostrated and flattened by this rapid and romantic way of
righting wrongs. If a modern philanthropist came to Dotheboys Hall I
fear he would not employ the simple, sacred, and truly Christian
solution of beating Mr. Squeers with a stick. I fancy he would petition
the Government to appoint a Royal Commission to inquire into Mr.
Squeers. I think he would every now and then write letters to newspapers
reminding people that, in spite of all appearances to the contrary,
there was a Royal Commission to inquire into Mr. Squeers. I agree that
he might even go the length of calling a crowded meeting in St.
James&rsquo;s Hall on the subject of the best policy with regard to Mr.
Squeers. At this meeting some very heated and daring speakers might even
go the length of alluding sternly to Mr. Squeers. Occasionally even
hoarse voices from the back of the hall might ask (in vain) what was
going to be done with Mr. Squeers. The Royal Commission would report
about three years afterwards and would say that many things had happened
which were certainly most regrettable; that Mr. Squeers was the victim
of a bad system; that Mrs. Squeers was also the victim of a bad system;
but that the man who sold Squeers his cane had really acted with great
indiscretion and ought to be spoken to kindly. Something like this would
be what, after four <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
years, the Royal Commission would have said; but it would not matter in
the least what the Royal Commission had said, for by that time the
philanthropists would be off on a new tack and the world would have
forgotten all about Dotheboys Hall and everything connected with it. By
that time the philanthropists would be petitioning Parliament for
another Royal Commission; perhaps a Royal Commission to inquire into
whether Mr. Mantalini was extravagant with his wife&rsquo;s money;
perhaps a commission to inquire into whether Mr. Vincent Crummles kept
the Infant Phenomenon short by means of gin.</p>

<p>If we wish to understand the spirit and the period of <i>Nicholas
Nickleby</i> we must endeavour to comprehend and to appreciate the old more
decisive remedies, or, if we prefer to put it so, the old more desperate
remedies. Our fathers had a plain sort of pity; if you will, a gross and
coarse pity. They had their own sort of sentimentalism. They were quite
willing to weep over Smike. But it certainly never occurred to them to
weep over Squeers. Even those who opposed the French war opposed it
exactly in the same way as their enemies opposed the French soldiers.
They fought with fighting. Charles Fox was full of horror at the
bitterness and the useless bloodshed; but if any one had insulted him
over the matter, he would have gone out and shot him in a duel as coolly
as any of his contemporaries. All their interference was heroic
interference. All their legislation was heroic legislation. All their
remedies were heroic remedies. No doubt they were often narrow and often
visionary. No doubt they often looked at a political formula when they
should have <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
looked at an elemental fact. No doubt they were pedantic in some of
their principles and clumsy in some of their solutions. No doubt, in
short, they were all very wrong; and no doubt we are the people, and
wisdom shall die with us. But when they saw something which in their
eyes, such as they were, really violated their morality, such as it was,
then they did not cry &ldquo;Investigate!&rdquo; They did not cry
&ldquo;Educate!&rdquo; They did not cry &ldquo;Improve!&rdquo; They did
not cry &ldquo;Evolve!&rdquo; Like Nicholas Nickleby they cried
&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; And it did stop.</p>

<p>This is the first mark of the purely romantic method: the swiftness and
simplicity with which St. George kills the dragon. The second mark of it
is exhibited here as one of the weaknesses of <i>Nicholas Nickleby</i>. I
mean the tendency in the purely romantic story to regard the heroine
merely as something to be won; to regard the princess solely as
something to be saved from the dragon. The father of Madeline Bray is
really a very respectable dragon. His selfishness is suggested with much
more psychological tact and truth than that of any other of the villains
that Dickens described about this time. But his daughter is merely the
young woman with whom Nicholas is in love. We do not care a rap about
Madeline Bray. Personally I should have preferred Cecilia Bobster. Here
is one real point where the Victorian romance falls below the
Elizabethan romantic drama. Shakespeare always made his heroines heroic
as well as his heroes.</p>

<p>In Dickens&rsquo;s actual literary career it is this romantic quality in
<i>Nicholas Nickleby</i> that is most important. It is his first definite
attempt to write a young and chivalrous <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
novel. In this sense the comic characters and the comic scenes are
secondary; and indeed the comic characters and the comic scenes,
admirable as they are, could never be considered as in themselves
superior to such characters and such scenes in many of the other books.
But in themselves how unforgettable they are. Mr. Crummles and the whole
of his theatrical business is an admirable case of that first and most
splendid quality in Dickens&mdash;I mean the art of making something
which in life we call pompous and dull, becoming in literature pompous
and delightful. I have remarked before that nearly every one of the
amusing characters of Dickens is in reality a great fool. But I might go
further. Almost every one of his amusing characters is in reality a
great bore. The very people that we fly to in Dickens are the very
people that we fly from in life. And there is more in Crummles than the
mere entertainment of his solemnity and his tedium. The enormous
seriousness with which he takes his art is always an exact touch in
regard to the unsuccessful artist. If an artist is successful,
everything then depends upon a dilemma of his moral character. If he is
a mean artist success will make him a society man. If he is a
magnanimous artist, success will make him an ordinary man. But only as
long as he is unsuccessful will he be an unfathomable and serious
artist, like Mr. Crummles. Dickens was always particularly good at
expressing thus the treasures that belong to those who do not succeed in
this world. There are vast prospects and splendid songs in the point of
view of the typically unsuccessful man; if all the used-up actors and
spoilt journalists and broken clerks could give a chorus, it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
would be a wonderful chorus in praise of the world. But these
unsuccessful men commonly cannot even speak. Dickens is the voice of
them, and a very ringing voice; because he was perhaps the only one of
these unsuccessful men that was ever successful.</p>

<h2><a name="OLIVER" id="OLIVER"></a>OLIVER TWIST</h2>

<p>In considering Dickens, as we almost always must consider him, as a man
of rich originality, we may possibly miss the forces from which he drew
even his original energy. It is not well for man to be alone. We, in the
modern world, are ready enough to admit that when it is applied to some
problem of monasticism or of an ecstatic life. But we will not admit
that our modern artistic claim to absolute originality is really a claim
to absolute unsociability; a claim to absolute loneliness. The anarchist
is at least as solitary as the ascetic. And the men of very vivid vigour
in literature, the men such as Dickens, have generally displayed a large
sociability towards the society of letters, always expressed in the
happy pursuit of pre-existent themes, sometimes expressed, as in the
case of Moli&egrave;re or Sterne, in downright plagiarism. For even theft is a
confession of our dependence on society. In Dickens, however, this
element of the original foundations on which he worked is quite
especially difficult to determine. This is partly due to the fact that
for the present reading public he is practically the only one of his
long line that is read at all. He sums up Smollett and Goldsmith, but he
also destroys them. This one giant, being closest to us, cuts off from
our view even the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
giants that begat him. But much more is this difficulty due to the fact
that Dickens mixed up with the old material, materials so subtly modern,
so made of the French Revolution, that the whole is transformed. If we
want the best example of this, the best example is <i>Oliver Twist</i>.</p>

<p>Relatively to the other works of Dickens <i>Oliver Twist</i> is not of great
value, but it is of great importance. Some parts of it are so crude and
of so clumsy a melodrama, that one is almost tempted to say that Dickens
would have been greater without it. But even if he had been greater
without it he would still have been incomplete without it. With the
exception of some gorgeous passages, both of humour and horror, the
interest of the book lies not so much in its revelation of
Dickens&rsquo;s literary genius as in its revelation of those moral,
personal, and political instincts which were the make-up of his
character and the permanent support of that literary genius. It is by
far the most depressing of all his books; it is in some ways the most
irritating; yet its ugliness gives the last touch of honesty to all that
spontaneous and splendid output. Without this one discordant note all
his merriment might have seemed like levity.</p>

<p>Dickens had just appeared upon the stage and set the whole world
laughing with his first great story <i>Pickwick</i>. <i>Oliver Twist</i> was his
encore. It was the second opportunity given to him by those who had
rolled about with laughter over Tupman and Jingle, Weller and Dowler.
Under such circumstances a stagey reciter will sometimes take care to
give a pathetic piece after his humorous one; and with all his many
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
moral merits, there was much that was stagey about Dickens. But this
explanation alone is altogether inadequate and unworthy. There was in
Dickens this other kind of energy, horrible, uncanny, barbaric, capable
in another age of coarseness, greedy for the emblems of established
ugliness, the coffin, the gibbet, the bones, the bloody knife. Dickens
liked these things and he was all the more of a man for liking them;
especially he was all the more of a boy. We can all recall with pleasure
the fact that Miss Petowker (afterwards Mrs. Lillyvick) was in the habit
of reciting a poem called &ldquo;The Blood Drinker&rsquo;s
Burial.&rdquo; I cannot express my regret that the words of this poem
are not given; for Dickens would have been quite as capable of writing
&ldquo;The Blood Drinker&rsquo;s Burial&rdquo; as Miss Petowker was of
reciting it. This strain existed in Dickens alongside of his happy
laughter; both were allied to the same robust romance. Here as elsewhere
Dickens is close to all the permanent human things. He is close to
religion, which has never allowed the thousand devils on its churches to
stop the dancing of its bells. He is allied to the people, to the real
poor, who love nothing so much as to take a cheerful glass and to talk
about funerals. The extremes of his gloom and gaiety are the mark of
religion and democracy; they mark him off from the moderate happiness of
philosophers, and from that stoicism which is the virtue and the creed
of aristocrats. There is nothing odd in the fact that the same man who
conceived the humane hospitalities of Pickwick should also have imagined
the inhuman laughter of Fagin&rsquo;s den. They are both genuine and
they are both exaggerated. And the whole human <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
tradition has tied up together in a strange knot these strands of
festivity and fear. It is over the cups of Christmas Eve that men have
always competed in telling ghost stories.</p>

<p>This first element was present in Dickens, and it is very powerfully
present in <i>Oliver Twist</i>. It had not been present with sufficient
consistency or continuity in <i>Pickwick</i> to make it remain on the
reader&rsquo;s memory at all, for the tale of &ldquo;Gabriel
Grubb&rdquo; is grotesque rather than horrible, and the two gloomy
stories of the &ldquo;Madman&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Queer Client&rdquo;
are so utterly irrelevant to the tale, that even if the reader remember
them he probably does not remember that they occur in <i>Pickwick</i>.
Critics have complained of Shakespeare and others for putting comic
episodes into a tragedy. It required a man with the courage and
coarseness of Dickens actually to put tragic episodes into a farce. But
they are not caught up into the story at all. In <i>Oliver Twist</i>,
however, the thing broke out with an almost brutal inspiration, and
those who had fallen in love with Dickens for his generous buffoonery
may very likely have been startled at receiving such very different fare
at the next helping. When you have bought a man&rsquo;s book because you
like his writing about Mr. Wardle&rsquo;s punch-bowl and Mr.
Winkle&rsquo;s skates, it may very well be surprising to open it and
read about the sickening thuds that beat out the life of Nancy, or that
mysterious villain whose face was blasted with disease.</p>

<p>As a nightmare, the work is really admirable. Characters which are not
very clearly conceived as regards their own psychology are yet, at
certain moments, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
managed so as to shake to its foundations our own psychology. Bill
Sikes is not exactly a real man, but for all that he is a real murderer.
Nancy is not really impressive as a living woman; but (as the phrase
goes) she makes a lovely corpse. Something quite childish and eternal in
us, something which is shocked with the mere simplicity of death,
quivers when we read of those repeated blows or see Sikes cursing the
tell-tale cur who will follow his bloody foot-prints. And this strange,
sublime, vulgar melodrama, which is melodrama and yet is painfully real,
reaches its hideous height in that fine scene of the death of Sikes, the
besieged house, the boy screaming within, the crowd screaming without,
the murderer turned almost a maniac and dragging his victim uselessly up
and down the room, the escape over the roof, the rope swiftly running
taut, and death sudden, startling and symbolic; a man hanged. There is
in this and similar scenes something of the quality of Hogarth and many
other English moralists of the early eighteenth century. It is not easy
to define this Hogarthian quality in words, beyond saying that it is a
sort of alphabetical realism, like the cruel candour of children. But it
has about it these two special principles which separate it from all
that we call realism in our time. First, that with us a moral story
means a story about moral people; with them a moral story meant more
often a story about immoral people. Second, that with us realism is
always associated with some subtle view of morals; with them realism was
always associated with some simple view of morals. The end of Bill Sikes
exactly in the way that the law would have killed him&mdash;this is a
Hogarthian incident; it <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
carries on that tradition of startling and shocking platitude.</p>

<p>All this element in the book was a sincere thing in the author, but none
the less it came from old soils, from the graveyard and the gallows, and
the lane where the ghost walked. Dickens was always attracted to such
things, and (as Forster says with inimitable simplicity) &ldquo;but for
his strong sense might have fallen into the follies of
spiritualism.&rdquo; As a matter of fact, like most of the men of strong
sense in his tradition, Dickens was left with a half belief in spirits
which became in practice a belief in bad spirits. The great disadvantage
of those who have too much strong sense to believe in supernaturalism is
that they keep last the low and little forms of the supernatural, such
as omens, curses, spectres, and retributions, but find a high and happy
supernaturalism quite incredible. Thus the Puritans denied the
sacraments, but went on burning witches. This shadow does rest, to some
extent, upon the rational English writers like Dickens; supernaturalism
was dying, but its ugliest roots died last. Dickens would have found it
easier to believe in a ghost than in a vision of the Virgin with angels.
There, for good or evil, however, was the root of the old <i>diablerie</i> in
Dickens, and there it is in <i>Oliver Twist</i>. But this was only the first
of the new Dickens elements, which must have surprised those Dickensians
who eagerly bought his second book. The second of the new Dickens
elements is equally indisputable and separate. It swelled afterwards to
enormous proportions in Dickens&rsquo;s work; but it really has its rise
here. Again, as in the case of the element of <i>diablerie</i>, it would be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
possible to make technical exceptions in favour of <i>Pickwick</i>. Just as
there were quite inappropriate scraps of the gruesome element in
<i>Pickwick</i>, so there are quite inappropriate allusions to this other
topic in <i>Pickwick</i>. But nobody by merely reading <i>Pickwick</i> would even
remember this topic; no one by merely reading <i>Pickwick</i> would know what
this topic is; this third great subject of Dickens; this second great
subject of the Dickens of <i>Oliver Twist</i>.</p>

<p>This subject is social oppression. It is surely fair to say that no one
could have gathered from <i>Pickwick</i> how this question boiled in the
blood of the author of <i>Pickwick</i>. There are, indeed, passages,
particularly in connection with Mr. Pickwick in the debtor&rsquo;s
prison, which prove to us, looking back on a whole public career, that
Dickens had been from the beginning bitter and inquisitive about the
problem of our civilisation. No one could have imagined at the time that
this bitterness ran in an unbroken river under all the surges of that
superb gaiety and exuberance. With <i>Oliver Twist</i> this sterner side of
Dickens was suddenly revealed. For the very first pages of <i>Oliver
Twist</i> are stern even when they are funny. They amuse, but they cannot
be enjoyed, as can the passages about the follies of Mr. Snodgrass or
the humiliations of Mr. Winkle. The difference between the old easy
humour and this new harsh humour is a difference not of degree but of
kind. Dickens makes game of Mr. Bumble because he wants to kill Mr.
Bumble; he made game of Mr. Winkle because he wanted him to live for
ever. Dickens has taken the sword in hand; against what is he declaring
war?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
It is just here that the greatness of Dickens comes in; it is just here
that the difference lies between the pedant and the poet. Dickens enters
the social and political war, and the first stroke he deals is not only
significant but even startling. Fully to see this we must appreciate the
national situation. It was an age of reform, and even of radical reform;
the world was full of radicals and reformers; but only too many of them
took the line of attacking everything and anything that was opposed to
some particular theory among the many political theories that possessed
the end of the eighteenth century. Some had so much perfected the
perfect theory of republicanism that they almost lay awake at night
because Queen Victoria had a crown on her head. Others were so certain
that mankind had hitherto been merely strangled in the bonds of the
State that they saw truth only in the destruction of tariffs or of
by-laws. The greater part of that generation held that clearness,
economy, and a hard common-sense, would soon destroy the errors that had
been erected by the superstitions and sentimentalities of the past. In
pursuance of this idea many of the new men of the new century, quite
confident that they were invigorating the new age, sought to destroy the
old sentimental clericalism, the old sentimental feudalism, the
old-world belief in priests, the old-world belief in patrons, and among
other things the old-world belief in beggars. They sought among other
things to clear away the old visionary kindliness on the subject of
vagrants. Hence those reformers enacted not only a new reform bill but
also a new poor law. In creating many other modern things they created
the modern <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
workhouse, and when Dickens came out to fight it was the first thing
that he broke with his battle-axe.</p>

<p>This is where Dickens&rsquo;s social revolt is of more value than mere
politics and avoids the vulgarity of the novel with a purpose. His
revolt is not a revolt of the commercialist against the feudalist, of
the Nonconformist against the Churchman, of the Free-trader against the
Protectionist, of the Liberal against the Tory. If he were among us now
his revolt would not be the revolt of the Socialist against the
Individualist, or of the Anarchist against the Socialist. His revolt was
simply and solely the eternal revolt; it was the revolt of the weak
against the strong. He did not dislike this or that argument for
oppression; he disliked oppression. He disliked a certain look on the
face of a man when he looks down on another man. And that look on the
face is, indeed, the only thing in the world that we have really to
fight between here and the fires of Hell. That which pedants of that
time and this time would have called the sentimentalism of Dickens was
really simply the detached sanity of Dickens. He cared nothing for the
fugitive explanations of the Constitutional Conservatives; he cared
nothing for the fugitive explanations of the Manchester School. He would
have cared quite as little for the fugitive explanations of the Fabian
Society or of the modern scientific Socialist. He saw that under many
forms there was one fact, the tyranny of man over man; and he struck at
it when he saw it, whether it was old or new. When he found that footmen
and rustics were too much afraid of Sir Leicester Dedlock, he attacked
Sir Leicester Dedlock; he did not care whether Sir Leicester Dedlock
said he was <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
attacking England or whether Mr. Rouncewell, the Ironmaster, said he
was attacking an effete oligarchy. In that case he pleased Mr.
Rouncewell, the Iron-master, and displeased Sir Leicester Dedlock, the
Aristocrat. But when he found that Mr. Rouncewell&rsquo;s workmen were
much too frightened of Mr. Rouncewell, then he displeased Mr. Rouncewell
in turn; he displeased Mr. Rouncewell very much by calling him Mr.
Bounderby. When he imagined himself to be fighting old laws he gave a
sort of vague and general approval to new laws. But when he came to the
new laws they had a bad time. When Dickens found that after a hundred
economic arguments and granting a hundred economic considerations, the
fact remained that paupers in modern workhouses were much too afraid of
the beadle, just as vassals in ancient castles were much too afraid of
the Dedlocks, then he struck suddenly and at once. This is what makes
the opening chapters of <i>Oliver Twist</i> so curious and important. The
very fact of Dickens&rsquo;s distance from, and independence of, the
elaborate financial arguments of his time, makes more definite and
dazzling his sudden assertion that he sees the old human tyranny in
front of him as plain as the sun at noon-day. Dickens attacks the modern
workhouse with a sort of inspired simplicity as of a boy in a fairy tale
who had wandered about, sword in hand, looking for ogres and who had
found an indisputable ogre. All the other people of his time are
attacking things because they are bad economics or because they are bad
politics, or because they are bad science; he alone is attacking things
because they are bad. All the others are Radicals with a large R; he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
alone is radical with a small one. He encounters evil with that
beautiful surprise which, as it is the beginning of all real pleasure,
is also the beginning of all righteous indignation. He enters the
workhouse just as Oliver Twist enters it, as a little child.</p>

<p>This is the real power and pathos of that celebrated passage in the book
which has passed into a proverb; but which has not lost its terrible
humour even in being hackneyed. I mean, of course, the everlasting
quotation about Oliver Twist asking for more. The real poignancy that
there is in this idea is a very good study in that strong school of
social criticism which Dickens represented. A modern realist describing
the dreary workhouse would have made all the children utterly crushed,
not daring to speak at all, not expecting anything, not hoping anything,
past all possibility of affording even an ironical contrast or a protest
of despair. A modern, in short, would have made all the boys in the
workhouse pathetic by making them all pessimists. But Oliver Twist is
not pathetic because he is a pessimist. Oliver Twist is pathetic because
he is an optimist. The whole tragedy of that incident is in the fact
that he does expect the universe to be kind to him, that he does believe
that he is living in a just world. He comes before the Guardians as the
ragged peasants of the French Revolution came before the Kings and
Parliaments of Europe. That is to say, he comes, indeed, with gloomy
experiences, but he comes with a happy philosophy. He knows that there
are wrongs of man to be reviled; but he believes also that there are
rights of man to be demanded. It has often been remarked as a singular
fact that the French <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
poor, who stand in historic tradition as typical of all the desperate
men who have dragged down tyranny, were, as a matter of fact, by no
means worse off than the poor of many other European countries before
the Revolution. The truth is that the French were tragic because they
were better off. The others had known the sorrowful experiences; but
they alone had known the splendid expectation and the original claims.
It was just here that Dickens was so true a child of them and of that
happy theory so bitterly applied. They were the one oppressed people
that simply asked for justice; they were the one Parish Boy who
innocently asked for more.</p>

<h2><a name="CURIOSITY" id="CURIOSITY"></a>OLD CURIOSITY SHOP</h2>

<p>Nothing is important except the fate of the soul; and literature is only
redeemed from an utter triviality, surpassing that of naughts and
crosses, by the fact that it describes not the world around us or the
things on the retina of the eye or the enormous irrelevancy of
encyclop&aelig;dias, but some condition to which the human spirit can come.
All good writers express the state of their souls, even (as occurs in
some cases of very good writers) if it is a state of damnation. The
first thing that has to be realised about Dickens is this ultimate
spiritual condition of the man, which lay behind all his creations. This
Dickens state of mind is difficult to pick out in words as are all
elementary states of mind; they cannot be described, not because they
are too subtle for words, but because they are too simple for words.
Perhaps the nearest approach to a statement of it would be this: that
Dickens expresses an eager anticipation of everything that will happen
in the motley affairs of men; he looks at the quiet crowd waiting for it
to be picturesque and to play the fool; he expects everything; he is
torn with a happy hunger. Thackeray is always looking back to yesterday;
Dickens is always looking forward to to-morrow. Both are profoundly
humorous, for there is a humour of the morning and a humour of the
evening; but the first <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
guesses at what it will get, at all the grotesqueness and variety which
a day may bring forth; the second looks back on what the day has been
and sees even its solemnities as slightly ironical. Nothing can be too
extravagant for the laughter that looks forward; and nothing can be too
dignified for the laughter that looks back. It is an idle but obvious
thing, which many must have noticed, that we often find in the title of
one of an author&rsquo;s books what might very well stand for a general
description of all of them. Thus all Spenser&rsquo;s works might be
called <i>A Hymn to Heavenly Beauty</i>; or all Mr. Bernard Shaw&rsquo;s
bound books might be called <i>You Never Can Tell</i>. In the same way the
whole substance and spirit of Thackeray might be gathered under the
general title <i>Vanity Fair</i>. In the same way too the whole substance and
spirit of Dickens might be gathered under the general title <i>Great
Expectations</i>.</p>

<p>In a recent criticism on this position I saw it remarked that all this
is reading into Dickens something that he did not mean; and I have been
told that it would have greatly surprised Dickens to be informed that he
&ldquo;went down the broad road of the Revolution.&rdquo; Of course it
would. Criticism does not exist to say about authors the things that
they knew themselves. It exists to say the things about them which they
did not know themselves. If a critic says that the <i>Iliad</i> has a pagan
rather than a Christian pity, or that it is full of pictures made by one
epithet, of course he does not mean that Homer could have said that. If
Homer could have said that the critic would leave Homer to say it. The
function of criticism, if it has a legitimate function at all, can only
be one function&mdash;that <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
of dealing with the subconscious part of the author&rsquo;s mind which
only the critic can express, and not with the conscious part of the
author&rsquo;s mind, which the author himself can express. Either
criticism is no good at all (a very defensible position) or else
criticism means saying about an author the very things that would have
made him jump out of his boots.</p>

<p>Doubtless the name in this case <i>Great Expectations</i> is an empty
coincidence; and indeed it is not in the books of the later Dickens
period (the period of <i>Great Expectations</i>) that we should look for the
best examples of this sanguine and expectant spirit which is the
essential of the man&rsquo;s genius. There are plenty of good examples
of it especially in the earlier works. But even in the earlier works
there is no example of it more striking or more satisfactory than <i>The
Old Curiosity Shop</i>. It is particularly noticeable in the fact that its
opening and original framework express the idea of a random experience,
a thing come across in the street; a single face in the crowd, followed
until it tells its story. Though the thing ends in a novel it begins in
a sketch; it begins as one of the <i>Sketches by Boz</i>. There is something
unconsciously artistic in the very clumsiness of this opening. Master
Humphrey starts to keep a scrap-book of all his adventures, and he finds
that he can fill the whole scrap-book with the sequels and developments
of one adventure; he goes out to notice everybody and he finds himself
busily and variedly occupied only in watching somebody. In this there is
a very profound truth about the true excitement and inexhaustible poetry
of life. The truth is not so much that eternity is full of souls as that
one soul can <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
fill eternity. In strict art there is something quite lame and
lumbering about the way in which the benevolent old story-teller starts
to tell many stories and then drops away altogether, while one of his
stories takes his place. But in a larger art, his collision with Little
Nell and his complete eclipse by her personality and narrative have a
real significance. They suggest the random richness of such meetings,
and their uncalculated results. It makes the whole book a sort of
splendid accident.</p>

<p>It is not true, as is commonly said, that the Dickens pathos as pathos
is bad. It is not true, as is still more commonly said, that the whole
business about Little Nell is bad. The case is more complex than that.
Yet complex as it is it admits of one sufficiently clear distinction.
Those who have written about the death of Little Nell, have generally
noticed the crudities of the character itself; the little girl&rsquo;s
unnatural and staring innocence, her constrained and awkward piety. But
they have nearly all of them entirely failed to notice that there is in
the death of Little Nell one quite definite and really artistic idea. It
is not an artistic idea that a little child should die rhetorically on
the stage like Paul Dombey; and Little Nell does not die rhetorically
upon the stage like Paul Dombey. But it is an artistic idea that all the
good powers and personalities in the story should set out in pursuit of
one insignificant child, to repair an injustice to her, should track her
from town to town over England with all the resources of wealth,
intelligence, and travel, and should all&mdash;arrive too late. All the good
fairies and all the kind magicians, all the just kings and all the
gallant <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
princes, with chariots and flying dragons and armies and navies go
after one little child who had strayed into a wood, and find her dead.
That is the conception which Dickens&rsquo;s artistic instinct was
really aiming at when he finally condemned Little Nell to death, after
keeping her, so to speak, so long with the rope round her neck. The
death of Little Nell is open certainly to the particular denial which
its enemies make about it. The death of Little Nell is not pathetic. It
is perhaps tragic; it is in reality ironic. Here is a very good case of
the injustice to Dickens on his purely literary side. It is not that I
say that Dickens achieved what he designed; it is that the critics will
not see what the design was. They go on talking of the death of Little
Nell as if it were a mere example of maudlin description like the death
of Little Paul. As a fact it is not described at all; so it cannot be
objectionable. It is not the death of Little Nell, but the life of
Little Nell, that I object to.</p>

<p>In this, in the actual picture of her personality, if you can call it a
personality, Dickens did fall into some of his facile vices. The real
objection to much of his pathos belongs really to another part of his
character. It is connected with his vanity, his voracity for all kinds
of praise, his restive experimentalism and even perhaps his envy. He
strained himself to achieve pathos. His humour was inspiration; but his
pathos was ambition. His laughter was lonely; he would have laughed on a
desert island. But his grief was gregarious. He liked to move great
masses of men, to melt them into tenderness, to play on the people as a
great pianist plays on them; to make them mad or sad. His pathos
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
was to him a way of showing his power; and for that reason it was
really powerless. He could not help making people laugh; but he tried to
make them cry. We come in this novel, as we often do come in his novels,
upon hard lumps of unreality, upon a phrase that suddenly sickens. That
is always due to his conscious despotism over the delicate feelings;
that is always due to his love of fame as distinct from his love of fun.
But it is not true that all Dickens&rsquo;s pathos is like this; it is
not even true that all the passages about Little Nell are like this;
there are two strands almost everywhere and they can be differentiated
as the sincere and the deliberate. There is a great difference between
Dickens thinking about the tears of his characters and Dickens thinking
about the tears of his audience.</p>

<p>When all this is allowed, however, and the exaggerated contempt for the
Dickens pathos is properly corrected, the broad fact remains: that to
pass from the solemn characters in this book to the comic characters in
this book, is to be like some Ulysses who should pass suddenly from the
land of shadows to the mountain of the gods. Little Nell has her own
position in careful and reasonable criticism: even that wobbling old
ass, her grandfather, has his position in it; perhaps even the
dissipated Fred (whom long acquaintance with Mr. Dick Swiveller has not
made any less dismal in his dissipation) has a place in it also. But
when we come to Swiveller and Sampson Brass and Quilp and Mrs. Jarley,
then Fred and Nell and the grandfather simply do not exist. There are no
such people in the story. The real hero and heroine of <i>The Old
Curiosity Shop</i> are of course Dick Swiveller and the Marchioness.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
It is significant in a sense that these two sane, strong, living, and
lovable human beings are the only two, or almost the only two, people in
the story who do not run after Little Nell. They have something better
to do than to go on that shadowy chase after that cheerless phantom.
They have to build up between them a true romance; perhaps the one true
romance in the whole of Dickens. Dick Swiveller really has all the
half-heroic characteristics which make a man respected by a woman and
which are the male contribution to virtue. He is brave, magnanimous,
sincere about himself, amusing, absurdly hopeful; above all, he is both
strong and weak. On the other hand the Marchioness really has all the
characteristics, the entirely heroic characteristics which make a woman
respected by a man. She is female: that is, she is at once incurably
candid and incurably loyal, she is full of terrible common-sense, she
expects little pleasure for herself and yet she can enjoy bursts of it;
above all, she is physically timid and yet she can face anything. All
this solid rocky romanticism is really implied in the speech and action
of these two characters and can be felt behind them all the time.
Because they are the two most absurd people in the book they are also
the most vivid, human, and imaginable. There are two really fine love
affairs in Dickens; and I almost think only two. One is the happy
courtship of Swiveller and the Marchioness; the other is the tragic
courtship of Toots and Florence Dombey. When Dick Swiveller wakes up in
bed and sees the Marchioness playing cribbage he thinks that he and she
are a prince and princess in a fairy tale. He thinks right.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
I speak thus seriously of such characters with a deliberate purpose; for
the frivolous characters of Dickens are taken much too frivolously. It
has been quite insufficiently pointed out that all the serious moral
ideas that Dickens did contrive to express he expressed altogether
through this fantastic medium, in such figures as Swiveller and the
little servant. The warmest upholder of Dickens would not go to the
solemn or sentimental passages for anything fresh or suggestive in faith
or philosophy. No one would pretend that the death of little Dombey
(with its &ldquo;What are the wild waves saying?&rdquo;) told us
anything new or real about death. A good Christian dying, one would
imagine, not only would not know what the wild waves were saying, but
would not care. No one would pretend that the repentance of old Paul
Dombey throws any light on the
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note: The original showed 'pyschology'.">psychology</ins>
or philosophy of repentance. No doubt old Dombey, white-haired and
amiable, was a great improvement on old Dombey brown-haired and
unpleasant. But in his case the softening of the heart seems to bear too
close a resemblance to softening of the brain. Whether these serious
passages are as bad as the critical people or as good as the sentimental
people find them, at least they do not convey anything in the way of an
illuminating glimpse or a bold suggestion about men&rsquo;s moral
nature. The serious figures do not tell one anything about the human
soul. The comic figures do. Take anything almost at random out of these
admirable speeches of Dick Swiveller. Notice, for instance, how
exquisitely Dickens has caught a certain very deep and delicate quality
at the bottom of this idle kind of man. I <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
mean that odd impersonal sort of intellectual justice, by which the
frivolous fellow sees things as they are and even himself as he is; and
is above irritation. Mr. Swiveller, you remember, asks the Marchioness
whether the Brass family ever talk about him; she nods her head with
vivacity. &ldquo;&lsquo;Complimentary?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Swiveller.
The motion of the little servant&rsquo;s head altered.... &lsquo;But she
says,&rsquo; continued the little servant, &lsquo;that you ain&rsquo;t
to be trusted.&rsquo; &lsquo;Well, do you know, Marchioness,&rsquo; said
Mr. Swiveller thoughtfully, &lsquo;many people, not exactly professional
people, but tradesmen, have had the same idea. The excellent citizen
from whom I ordered this beer inclines strongly to that
opinion.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>This philosophical freedom from all resentment, this strange love of
truth which seems actually to come through carelessness, is a very real
piece of spiritual observation. Even among liars there are two classes,
one immeasurably better than another. The honest liar is the man who
tells the truth about his old lies; who says on Wednesday, &ldquo;I told
a magnificent lie on Monday.&rdquo; He keeps the truth in circulation;
no one version of things stagnates in him and becomes an evil secret. He
does not have to live with old lies; a horrible domesticity. Mr.
Swiveller may mislead the waiter about whether he has the money to pay;
but he does not mislead his friend, and he does not mislead himself on
the point. He is quite as well aware as any one can be of the
accumulating falsity of the position of a gentleman who by his various
debts has closed up all the streets into the Strand except one, and who
is going to close that to-night with a pair of gloves.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
He shuts up the street with a pair of gloves, but he does not shut up
his mind with a secret. The traffic of truth is still kept open through
his soul.</p>

<p>It is exactly in these absurd characters, then, that we can find a mass
of psychological and ethical suggestion. This cannot be found in the
serious characters except indeed in some of the later experiments: there
is a little of such psychological and ethical suggestion in figures like
Gridley, like Jasper, like Bradley Headstone. But in these earlier books
at least, such as <i>The Old Curiosity Shop</i>, the grave or moral figures
throw no light upon morals. I should maintain this generalisation even
in the presence of that apparent exception <i>The Christmas Carol</i> with
its trio of didactic ghosts. Charity is certainly splendid, at once a
luxury and a necessity; but Dickens is not most effective when he is
preaching charity seriously; he is most effective when he is preaching
it uproariously; when he is preaching it by means of massive
personalities and vivid scenes. One might say that he is best not when
he is preaching his human love, but when he is practising it. In his
grave pages he tells us to love men; but in his wild pages he creates
men whom we can love. By his solemnity he commands us to love our
neighbours. By his caricature he makes us love them.</p>

<p>There is an odd literary question which I wonder is not put more often
in literature. How far can an author tell a truth without seeing it
himself? Perhaps an actual example will express my meaning. I was once
talking to a highly intelligent lady about Thackeray&rsquo;s <i>Newcomes</i>.
We were speaking of the character of Mrs. Mackenzie, the Campaigner, and
in the middle <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
of the conversation the lady leaned across to me and said in a low,
hoarse, but emphatic voice, &ldquo;She drank. Thackeray didn&rsquo;t
know it; but she drank.&rdquo; And it is really astonishing what a shaft
of white light this sheds on the Campaigner, on her terrible
temperament, on her agonised abusiveness and her almost more agonised
urbanity, on her clamour which is nevertheless not open or explicable,
on her temper which is not so much bad temper as insatiable,
bloodthirsty, man-eating temper. How far can a writer thus indicate by
accident a truth of which he is himself ignorant? If truth is a plan or
pattern of things that really are, or in other words, if truth truly
exists outside ourselves, or in other words, if truth exists at all, it
must be often possible for a writer to uncover a corner of it which he
happens not to understand, but which his reader does happen to
understand. The author sees only two lines; the reader sees where they
meet and what is the angle. The author sees only an arc or fragment of a
curve; the reader sees the size of the circle. The last thing to say
about Dickens, and especially about books like <i>The Old Curiosity Shop</i>,
is that they are full of these unconscious truths. The careless reader
may miss them. The careless author almost certainly did miss them. But
from them can be gathered an impression of real truth to life which is
for the grave critics of Dickens an almost unknown benefit, buried
treasure. Here for instance is one of them out of <i>The Old Curiosity
Shop</i>. I mean the passage in which (by a blazing stroke of genius) the
dashing Mr. Chuckster, one of the Glorious Apollos of whom Mr. Swiveller
was the Perpetual Grand, is made to entertain a hatred bordering upon
frenzy <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
for the stolid, patient, respectful, and laborious Kit. Now in the
formal plan of the story Mr. Chuckster is a fool, and Kit is almost a
hero; at least he is a noble boy. Yet unconsciously Dickens made the
idiot Chuckster say something profoundly suggestive on the subject. In
speaking of Kit Mr. Chuckster makes use of these two remarkable phrases;
that Kit is &ldquo;meek&rdquo; and that he is &ldquo;a snob.&rdquo; Now
Kit is really a very fresh and manly picture of a boy, firm, sane,
chivalrous, reasonable, full of those three great Roman virtues which
Mr. Belloc has so often celebrated, <i>virtus</i> and <i>verecundia</i> and
<i>pietas</i>. He is a sympathetic but still a straightforward study of the
best type of that most respectable of all human classes, the respectable
poor. All this is true; all that Dickens utters in praise of Kit is
true; nevertheless the awful words of Chuckster remain written on the
eternal skies. Kit is meek and Kit is a snob. His natural dignity does
include and is partly marred by that instinctive subservience to the
employing class which has been the comfortable weakness of the whole
English democracy, which has prevented their making any revolution for
the last two hundred years. Kit would not serve any wicked man for
money, but he would serve any moderately good man and the money would
give a certain dignity and decisiveness to the goodness. All this is the
English popular evil which goes along with the English popular virtues
of geniality, of homeliness, tolerance and strong humour, hope and an
enormous appetite for a hand-to-mouth happiness. The scene in which Kit
takes his family to the theatre is a monument of the massive qualities
of old English enjoyment. If what we want is Merry England, our
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
antiquarians ought not to revive the Maypole or the Morris Dancers;
they ought to revive Astley&rsquo;s and Sadler&rsquo;s Wells and the old
solemn Circus and the old stupid Pantomime, and all the sawdust and all
the oranges. Of all this strength and joy in the poor, Kit is a splendid
and final symbol. But amid all his masculine and English virtue, he has
this weak touch of meekness, or acceptance of the powers that be. It is
a sound touch; it is a real truth about Kit. But Dickens did not know
it. Mr. Chuckster did.</p>

<p>Dickens&rsquo;s stories taken as a whole have more artistic unity than
appears at the first glance. It is the immediate impulse of a modern
critic to dismiss them as mere disorderly scrap-books with very
brilliant scraps. But this is not quite so true as it looks. In one of
Dickens&rsquo;s novels there is generally no particular unity of
construction; but there is often a considerable unity of sentiment and
atmosphere. Things are irrelevant, but not somehow inappropriate. The
whole book is written carelessly; but the whole book is generally
written in one mood. To take a rude parallel from the other arts, we may
say that there is not much unity of form, but there is much unity of
colour. In most of the novels this can be seen. <i>Nicholas Nickleby</i>, as
I have remarked, is full of a certain freshness, a certain light and
open-air curiosity, which irradiates from the image of the young man
swinging along the Yorkshire roads in the sun. Hence the comic
characters with whom he falls in are comic characters in the same key;
they are a band of strolling players, charlatans and poseurs, but too
humane to be called humbugs. In the same way, the central story of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
<i>Oliver Twist</i> is sombre; and hence even its comic character is almost
sombre; at least he is too ugly to be merely amusing. Mr. Bumble is in
some ways a terrible grotesque; his apoplectic visage recalls the
&ldquo;fire-red Cherubimme&rsquo;s face,&rdquo; which added such horror
to the height and stature of Chaucer&rsquo;s Sompnour. In both these
cases even the riotous and absurd characters are a little touched with
the tint of the whole story. But this neglected merit of Dickens can
certainly be seen best in <i>The Old Curiosity Shop</i>.</p>

<p>The curiosity shop itself was a lumber of grotesque and sinister things,
outlandish weapons, twisted and diabolic decorations. The comic
characters in the book are all like images bought in an old curiosity
shop. Quilp might be a gargoyle. He might be some sort of devilish
door-knocker, dropped down and crawling about the pavement. The same
applies to the sinister and really terrifying stiffness of Sally Brass.
She is like some old staring figure cut out of wood. Sampson Brass, her
brother, again is a grotesque in the same rather inhuman manner; he is
especially himself when he comes in with the green shade over his eye.
About all this group of bad figures in <i>The Old Curiosity Shop</i> there is
a sort of <i>diablerie</i>. There is also within this atmosphere an
extraordinary energy of irony and laughter. The scene in which Sampson
Brass draws up the description of Quilp, supposing him to be dead,
reaches a point of fiendish fun. &ldquo;We will not say very bandy, Mrs.
Jiniwin,&rdquo; he says of his friend&rsquo;s legs, &ldquo;we will
confine ourselves to bandy. He is gone, my friends, where his legs would
never be called in question.&rdquo; They go on to the discussion of his
nose, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
Mrs. Jiniwin inclines to the view that it is flat. &ldquo;Aquiline, you
hag! Aquiline,&rdquo; cries Mr. Quilp, pushing in his head and striking
his nose with his fist. There is nothing better in the whole brutal
exuberance of the character than that gesture with which Quilp punches
his own face with his own fist. It is indeed a perfect symbol; for Quilp
is always fighting himself for want of anybody else. He is energy, and
energy by itself is always suicidal; he is that primordial energy which
tears and which destroys itself.</p>

<h2><a name="BARNABY" id="BARNABY"></a>BARNABY RUDGE</h2>

<p><i>Barnaby Rudge</i> was written by Dickens in the spring and first flowing
tide of his popularity; it came immediately after <i>The Old Curiosity
Shop</i>, and only a short time after <i>Pickwick</i>. Dickens was one of those
rare but often very sincere men in whom the high moment of success
almost coincides with the high moment of youth. The calls upon him at
this time were insistent and overwhelming; this necessarily happens at a
certain stage of a successful writer&rsquo;s career. He was just
successful enough to invite offers and not successful enough to reject
them. At the beginning of his career he could throw himself into
<i>Pickwick</i> because there was nothing else to throw himself into. At the
end of his life he could throw himself into <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i>,
because he refused to throw himself into anything else. But there was an
intervening period, early in his life, when there was almost too much
work for his imagination, and yet not quite enough work for his
housekeeping. To this period <i>Barnaby Rudge</i> belongs. And it is a
curious tribute to the quite curious greatness of Dickens that in this
period of youthful strain we do not feel the strain but feel only the
youth. His own amazing wish to write equalled or outstripped even his
readers&rsquo; amazing wish to read. Working too hard did not cure him
of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
his abstract love of work. Unreasonable publishers asked him to write
ten novels at once; but he wanted to write twenty novels at once. All
this period is strangely full of his own sense at once of fertility and
of futility; he did work which no one else could have done, and yet he
could not be certain as yet that he was anybody.</p>

<p><i>Barnaby Rudge</i> marks this epoch because it marks the fact that he is
still confused about what kind of person he is going to be. He has
already struck the note of the normal romance in <i>Nicholas Nickleby</i>; he
has already created some of his highest comic characters in <i>Pickwick</i>
and <i>The Old Curiosity Shop</i>, but here he betrays the fact that it is
still a question what ultimate guide he shall follow. <i>Barnaby Rudge</i> is
a romantic, historical novel. Its design reminds us of Scott; some parts
of its fulfilment remind us, alas! of Harrison Ainsworth. It is a very
fine romantic historical novel; Scott would have been proud of it. But
it is still so far different from the general work of Dickens that it is
permissible to wonder how far Dickens was proud of it. The book,
effective as it is, is almost entirely devoted to dealings with a
certain artistic element, which (in its mere isolation) Dickens did not
commonly affect; an element which many men of infinitely less genius
have often seemed to affect more successfully; I mean the element of the
picturesque.</p>

<p>It is the custom in many quarters to speak somewhat sneeringly of that
element which is broadly called the picturesque. It is always felt to be
an inferior, a vulgar, and even an artificial form of art. Yet two
things may be remarked about it. The first is that,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
with few exceptions, the greatest literary artists have been not only
particularly clever at the picturesque, but particularly fond of it.
Shakespeare, for instance, delighted in certain merely pictorial
contrasts which are quite distinct from, even when they are akin to, the
spiritual view involved. For instance, there is admirable satire in the
idea of Touchstone teaching worldly wisdom and worldly honour to the
woodland yokels. There is excellent philosophy in the idea of the fool
being the representative of civilisation in the forest. But quite apart
from this deeper meaning in the incident, the mere figure of the jester,
in his bright motley and his cap and bells, against the green background
of the forest and the rude forms of the shepherds, is a strong example
of the purely picturesque. There is excellent tragic irony in the
confrontation of the melancholy philosopher among the tombs with the
cheerful digger of the graves. It sums up the essential point, that dead
bodies can be comic; it is only dead souls that can be tragic. But quite
apart from such irony, the mere picture of the grotesque gravedigger,
the black-clad prince, and the skull is a picture in the strongest sense
picturesque. Caliban and the two shipwrecked drunkards are an admirable
symbol; but they are also an admirable scene. Bottom, with the
ass&rsquo;s head, sitting in a ring of elves, is excellent moving
comedy, but also excellent still life. Falstaff with his huge body,
Bardolph with his burning nose, are masterpieces of the pen; but they
would be fine sketches even for the pencil. King Lear, in the storm, is
a landscape as well as a character study. There is something decorative
even about the insistence on the swarthiness <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
of Othello, or the deformity of Richard III. Shakespeare&rsquo;s work
is much more than picturesque; but it is picturesque. And the same which
is said here of him by way of example is largely true of the highest
class of literature. Dante&rsquo;s <i>Divine Comedy</i> is supremely
important as a philosophy; but it is important merely as a panorama.
Spenser&rsquo;s <i>Faery Queen</i> pleases us as an allegory; but it would
please us even as a wall-paper. Stronger still is the case of Chaucer
who loved the pure picturesque, which always includes something of what
we commonly call the ugly. The huge stature and startling scarlet face
of the Sompnour is in just the same spirit as Shakespeare&rsquo;s skulls
and motley; the same spirit gave Chaucer&rsquo;s miller bagpipes, and
clad his doctor in crimson. It is the spirit which, while making many
other things, loves to make a picture.</p>

<p>Now the second thing to be remarked in apology for the picturesque is,
that the very thing which makes it seem trivial ought really to make it
seem important; I mean the fact that it consists necessarily of
contrasts. It brings together types that stand out from their
background, but are abruptly different from each other, like the clown
among the fairies or the fool in the forest. And his audacious
reconciliation is a mark not of frivolity but of extreme seriousness. A
man who deals in harmonies, who only matches stars with angels or lambs
with spring flowers, he indeed may be frivolous; for he is taking one
mood at a time, and perhaps forgetting each mood as it passes. But a man
who ventures to combine an angel and an octopus must have some serious
view of the universe. The man who <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
should write a dialogue between two early Christians might be a mere
writer of dialogues. But a man who should write a dialogue between an
early Christian and the Missing Link would have to be a philosopher. The
more widely different the types talked of, the more serious and
universal must be the philosophy which talks of them. The mark of the
light and thoughtless writer is the harmony of his subject matter; the
mark of the thoughtful writer is its apparent diversity. The most
flippant lyric poet might write a pretty poem about lambs; but it
requires something bolder and graver than a poet, it requires an
ecstatic prophet, to talk about the lion lying down with the lamb.</p>

<p>Dickens, at any rate, strongly supports this conception: that great
literary men as such do not despise the purely pictorial. No man&rsquo;s
works have so much the quality of illustrating themselves. Few
men&rsquo;s works have been more thoroughly and eagerly illustrated; few
men&rsquo;s works can it have been better fun to illustrate. As a rule
this fascinating quality in the mere fantastic figures of the tale was
inseparable from their farcical quality in the tale. Stiggins&rsquo;s
red nose is distinctly connected with the fact that he is a member of
the Ebenezer Temperance Association; Quilp is little, because a little
of him goes a long way. Mr. Carker smiles and smiles and is a villain;
Mr. Chadband is fat because in his case to be fat is to be hated. The
story is immeasurably more important than the picture; it is not mere
indulgence in the picturesque. Generally it is an intellectual love of
the comic; not a pure love of the grotesque.</p>

<p>But in one book Dickens suddenly confesses that he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
likes the grotesque even without the comic. In one case he makes clear
that he enjoys pure pictures with a pure love of the picturesque. That
place is <i>Barnaby Rudge</i>. There had indeed been hints of it in many
episodes in his books; notably, for example, in that fine scene of the
death of Quilp&mdash;a scene in which the dwarf remains fantastic long
after he has ceased to be in any way funny. Still, the dwarf was meant
to be funny. Humour of a horrible kind, but still humour, is the purpose
of Quilp&rsquo;s existence and position in the book. Laughter is the
object of all his oddities. But laughter is not the object of Barnaby
Rudge&rsquo;s oddities. His idiot costume and his ugly raven are used
for the purpose of the pure grotesque; solely to make a certain kind of
Gothic sketch.</p>

<p>It is commonly this love of pictures that drives men back upon the
historical novel. But it is very typical of Dickens&rsquo;s living
interest in his own time, that though he wrote two historical novels
they were neither of them of very ancient history. They were both,
indeed, of very recent history; only they were those parts of recent
history which were specially picturesque. I do not think that this was
due to any mere consciousness on his part that he knew no history.
Undoubtedly he knew no history; and he may or may not have been
conscious of the fact. But the consciousness did not prevent him from
writing a <i>History of England</i>. Nor did it prevent him from interlarding
all or any of his works with tales of the pictorial past, such as the
tale of the broken swords in <i>Master Humphrey&rsquo;s Clock</i>, or the
indefensibly delightful nightmare of the lady in the stage-coach, which
helps to soften the amiable end <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
of Pickwick. Neither, worst of all, did it prevent him from dogmatising
anywhere and everywhere about the past, of which he knew nothing; it did
not prevent him from telling the bells to tell Trotty Veck that the
Middle Ages were a failure, nor from solemnly declaring that the best
thing that the medi&aelig;val monks ever did was to create the mean and
snobbish quietude of a modern cathedral city. No, it was not historical
reverence that held him back from dealing with the remote past; but
rather something much better&mdash;a living interest in the living
century in which he was born. He would have thought himself quite
intellectually capable of writing a novel about the Council of Trent or
the First Crusade. He would have thought himself quite equal to
analysing the psychology of Abelard or giving a bright, satiric sketch
of St. Augustine. It must frankly be confessed that it was not a sense
of his own unworthiness that held him back; I fear it was rather a sense
of St. Augustine&rsquo;s unworthiness. He could not see the point of any
history before the first slow swell of the French Revolution. He could
understand the revolutions of the eighteenth century; all the other
revolutions of history (so many and so splendid) were unmeaning to him.
But the revolutions of the eighteenth century he did understand; and to
them therefore he went back, as all historical novelists go back, in
search of the picturesque. And from this fact an important result
follows.</p>

<p>The result that follows is this: that his only two historical novels are
both tales of revolutions&mdash;of eighteenth-century revolutions. These two
eighteenth-century revolutions may seem to differ, and perhaps
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
do differ in everything except in being revolutions and of the
eighteenth century. The French Revolution, which is the theme of <i>A Tale
of Two Cities</i>, was a revolt in favour of all that is now called
enlightenment and liberation. The great Gordon Riot, which is the theme
of <i>Barnaby Rudge</i>, was a revolt in favour of something which would now
be called mere ignorant and obscurantist Protestantism. Nevertheless
both belonged more typically to the age out of which Dickens
came&mdash;the great sceptical and yet creative eighteenth century of
Europe. Whether the mob rose on the right side or the wrong they both
belonged to the time in which a mob could rise, in which a mob could
conquer. No growth of intellectual science or of moral cowardice had
made it impossible to fight in the streets, whether for the republic or
for the Bible. If we wish to know what was the real link, existing
actually in ultimate truth, existing unconsciously in Dickens&rsquo;s
mind, which connected the Gordon Riots with the French Revolution, the
link may be defined though not with any great adequacy. The nearest and
truest way of stating it is that neither of the two could possibly
happen in Fleet Street to-morrow evening.</p>

<p>Another point of resemblance between the two books might be found in the
fact that they both contain the sketch of the same kind of
eighteenth-century aristocrat, if indeed that kind of aristocrat really
existed in the eighteenth century. The diabolical dandy with the rapier
and the sneer is at any rate a necessity of all normal plays and
romances; hence Mr. Chester has a right to exist in this romance, and
Foulon a right to exist in a page of history almost as cloudy and
disputable <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
as a romance. What Dickens and other romancers do probably omit from
the picture of the eighteenth-century oligarch is probably his
liberality. It must never be forgotten that even when he was a despot in
practice he was generally a liberal in theory. Dickens and romancers
make the pre-revolution tyrant a sincere believer in tyranny; generally
he was not. He was a sceptic about everything, even about his own
position. The romantic Foulon says of the people, &ldquo;Let them eat
grass,&rdquo; with bitter and deliberate contempt. The real Foulon (if
he ever said it at all) probably said it as a sort of dreary joke
because he couldn&rsquo;t think of any other way out of the problem.
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note: The original showed 'Similiarly'.">Similarly</ins>
Mr. Chester, a cynic as he is, believes seriously in the beauty of being
a gentleman; a real man of that type probably disbelieved in that as in
everything else. Dickens was too bracing, one may say too bouncing
himself to understand the psychology of fatigue in a protected and
leisured class. He could understand a tyrant like Quilp, a tyrant who is
on his throne because he has climbed up into it, like a monkey. He could
not understand a tyrant who is on his throne because he is too weary to
get out of it. The old aristocrats were in a dead way quite
good-natured. They were even humanitarians; which perhaps accounts for
the extent to which they roused against themselves the healthy hatred of
humanity. But they were tired humanitarians; tired with doing nothing.
Figures like that of Mr. Chester, therefore, fail somewhat to give the
true sense of something hopeless and helpless which led men to despair
of the upper class. He has a boyish pleasure in play-acting; he has an
interest in life; being <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
a villain is his hobby. But the true man of that type had found all
hobbies fail him. He had wearied of himself as he had wearied of a
hundred women. He was graceful and could not even admire himself in the
glass. He was witty and could not even laugh at his own jokes. Dickens
could never understand tedium.</p>

<p>There is no mark more strange and perhaps sinister of the interesting
and not very sane condition of our modern literature, than the fact that
tedium has been admirably described in it. Our best modern writers are
never so exciting as they are about dulness. Mr. Rudyard Kipling is
never so powerful as when he is painting yawning deserts, aching
silences, sleepless nights, or infernal isolation. The excitement in one
of the stories of Mr. Henry James becomes tense, thrilling, and almost
intolerable in all the half hours during which nothing whatever is said
or done. We are entering again into the mind, into the real mind of
Foulon and Mr. Chester. We begin to understand the deep despair of those
tyrants whom our fathers pulled down. But Dickens could never have
understood that despair; it was not in his soul. And it is an
interesting coincidence that here, in this book of <i>Barnaby Rudge</i>,
there is a character meant to be wholly grotesque, who, nevertheless,
expresses much of that element in Dickens which prevented him from being
a true interpreter of the tired and sceptical aristocrat.</p>

<p>Sim Tappertit is a fool, but a perfectly honourable fool. It requires
some sincerity to pose. Posing means that one has not dried up in
oneself all the youthful and innocent vanities with the slow paralysis
of mere pride. Posing means that one is still fresh <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
enough to enjoy the good opinion of one&rsquo;s fellows. On the other
hand, the true cynic has not enough truth in him to attempt affectation;
he has never even seen the truth, far less tried to imitate it. Now we
might very well take the type of Mr. Chester on the one hand, and of Sim
Tappertit on the other, as marking the issue, the conflict, and the
victory which really ushered in the nineteenth century. Dickens was very
like Sim Tappertit. The Liberal Revolution was very like a Sim Tappertit
revolution. It was vulgar, it was overdone, it was absurd, but it was
alive. Dickens was vulgar, was absurd, overdid everything, but he was
alive. The aristocrats were perfectly correct, but quite dead; dead long
before they were guillotined. The classics and critics who lamented that
Dickens was no gentleman were quite right, but quite dead. The
revolution thought itself rational; but so did Sim Tappertit. It was
really a huge revolt of romanticism against a reason which had grown
sick even of itself. Sim Tappertit rose against Mr. Chester; and, thank
God! he put his foot upon his neck.</p>

<h2><a name="AMERICAN" id="AMERICAN"></a>AMERICAN NOTES</h2>

<p><i>American Notes</i> was written soon after Dickens had returned from his
first visit to America. That visit had, of course, been a great epoch in
his life; but how much of an epoch men did not truly realise until, some
time after, in the middle of a quiet story about Salisbury and a
ridiculous architect, his feelings flamed out and flared up to the stars
in <i>Martin Chuzzlewit</i>. The <i>American Notes</i> are, however, interesting,
because in them he betrays his feelings when he does not know that he is
betraying them. Dickens&rsquo;s first visit to America was, from his own
point of view, and at the beginning, a happy and festive experiment. It
is very characteristic of him that he went among the Americans, enjoyed
them, even admired them, and then had a quarrel with them. Nothing was
ever so unmistakable as his good-will, except his ill-will; and they
were never far apart. And this was not, as some bloodless moderns have
sneeringly insinuated, a mere repetition of the proximity between the
benevolent stage and the quarrelsome stage of drink. It was a piece of
pure optimism; he believed so readily that men were going to be good to
him that an injury to him was something more than an injury: it was a
shock. What was the exact nature of the American shock must, however, be
more carefully stated.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
The famous quarrel between Dickens and America, which finds its most
elaborate expression in <i>American Notes</i>, though its most brilliant
expression in <i>Martin Chuzzlewit</i>, is an incident about which a great
deal remains to be said. But the thing which most specially remains to
be said is this. This old Anglo-American quarrel was much more
fundamentally friendly than most Anglo-American alliances. In
Dickens&rsquo;s day each nation understood the other enough to argue. In
our time neither nation understands itself even enough to quarrel. There
was an English tradition, from Fox and eighteenth-century England; there
was an American tradition from Franklin and eighteenth-century America;
and they were still close enough together to discuss their differences
with acrimony, perhaps, but with certain fundamental understandings. The
eighteenth-century belief in a liberal civilisation was still a dogma;
for dogma is the only thing that makes argument or reasoning possible.
America, under all its swagger, did still really believe that Europe was
its fountain and its mother, because Europe was more fully civilised.
Dickens, under all his disgust, did still believe that America was in
advance of Europe, because it was more democratic. It was an age, in
short, in which the word &ldquo;progress&rdquo; could still be used
reasonably; because the whole world looked to one way of escape and
there was only one kind of progress under discussion. Now, of course,
&ldquo;progress&rdquo; is a useless word; for progress takes for granted
an already defined direction; and it is exactly about the direction that
we disagree. Do not let us therefore be misled into any mistaken
optimism or special self-congratulation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
upon what many people would call the improved relations between England
and America. The relations are improved because America has finally
become a foreign country. And with foreign countries all sane men take
care to exchange a certain consideration and courtesy. But even as late
as the time of Dickens&rsquo;s first visit to the United States, we
English still felt America as a colony; an insolent, offensive, and even
unintelligible colony sometimes, but still a colony; a part of our
civilisation, a limb of our life. And America itself, as I have said,
under all its bounce and independence, really regarded us as a mother
country. This being the case it was possible for us to quarrel, like
kinsmen. Now we only bow and smile, like strangers.</p>

<p>This tone, as a sort of family responsibility, can be felt quite
specially all through the satires or suggestions of these <i>American
Notes</i>. Dickens is cross with America because he is worried about
America; as if he were its father. He explores its industrial, legal,
and educational arrangements like a mother looking at the housekeeping
of a married son; he makes suggestions with a certain acidity; he takes
a strange pleasure in being pessimistic. He advises them to take note of
how much better certain things are done in England. All this is very
different from Dickens&rsquo;s characteristic way of dealing with a
foreign country. In countries really foreign, such as France,
Switzerland, and Italy, he had two attitudes, neither of them in the
least worried or paternal. When he found a thing in Europe which he did
not understand, such as the Roman Catholic Church, he simply called it
an old-world superstition, and sat looking at it like a moonlit
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
ruin. When he found something that he did understand, such as luncheon
baskets, he burst into carols of praise over the superior sense in our
civilisation and good management to Continental methods. An example of
the first attitude may be found in one of his letters, in which he
describes the backwardness and idleness of Catholics who would not build
a Birmingham in Italy. He seems quite unconscious of the obvious truth,
that the backwardness of Catholics was simply the refusal of Bob
Cratchit to enter the house of Gradgrind. An example of the second
attitude can be found in the purple patches of fun in <i>Mugby Junction</i>;
in which the English waitress denounces the profligate French habit of
providing new bread and clean food for people travelling by rail. The
point is, however, that in neither case has he the air of one suggesting
improvements or sharing a problem with the people engaged on it. He does
not go carefully with a notebook through Jesuit schools nor offer
friendly suggestions to the governors of Parisian prisons. Or if he
does, it is in a different spirit; it is in the spirit of an ordinary
tourist being shown over the Coliseum or the Pyramids. But he visited
America in the spirit of a Government inspector dealing with something
it was his duty to inspect. This is never felt either in his praise or
blame of Continental countries. When he did not leave a foreign country
to decay like a dead dog, he merely watched it at play like a kitten.
France he mistook for a kitten. Italy he mistook for a dead dog.</p>

<p>But with America he could feel&mdash;and fear. There he could hate, because
he could love. There he could feel <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
not the past alone nor the present, but the future also; and, like all
brave men, when he saw the future he was a little afraid of it. For of
all tests by which the good citizen and strong reformer can be
distinguished from the vague faddist or the inhuman sceptic, I know no
better test than this&mdash;that the unreal reformer sees in front of
him one certain future, the future of his fad; while the real reformer
sees before him ten or twenty futures among which his country must
choose, and may, in some dreadful hour, choose the wrong one. The true
patriot is always doubtful of victory; because he knows that he is
dealing with a living thing; a thing with free will. To be certain of
free will is to be uncertain of success.</p>

<p>The subject matter of the real difference of opinion between Dickens and
the public of America can only be understood if it is thus treated as a
dispute between brothers about the destiny of a common heritage. The
point at issue might be stated like this. Dickens, on his side, did not
in his heart doubt for a moment that England would eventually follow
America along the road towards real political equality and purely
republican institutions. He lived, it must be remembered, before the
revival of aristocracy, which has since overwhelmed us&mdash;the revival of
aristocracy worked through popular science and commercial dictatorship,
and which has nowhere been more manifest than in America itself. He knew
nothing of this; in his heart he conceded to the Yankees that not only
was their revolution right but would ultimately be completed everywhere.
But on the other hand, his whole point against the American experiment
was this&mdash;that if it ignored certain ancient<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
English contributions it would go to pieces for lack of them. Of these
the first was good manners and the second individual
liberty&mdash;liberty, that is, to speak and write against the trend of
the majority. In these things he was much more serious and much more
sensible than it is the fashion to think he was; he was indeed one of
the most serious and sensible critics England ever had of current and
present problems, though his criticism is useless to the point of
nonentity about all things remote from him in style of civilisation or
in time. His point about good manners is really important. All his
grumblings through this book of <i>American Notes</i>, all his shrieking
satire in <i>Martin Chuzzlewit</i> are expressions of a grave and reasonable
fear he had touching the future of democracy. And remember again what
has been already remarked&mdash;instinctively he paid America the
compliment of looking at her as the future of democracy.</p>

<p>The mistake which he attacked still exists. I cannot imagine why it is
that social equality is somehow supposed to mean social familiarity. Why
should equality mean that all men are equally rude? Should it not rather
mean that all men are equally polite? Might it not quite reasonably mean
that all men should be equally ceremonious and stately and pontifical?
What is there specially Equalitarian, for instance, in calling your
political friends and even your political enemies by their Christian
names in public? There is something very futile in the way in which
certain Socialist leaders call each other Tom, Dick, and Harry;
especially when Tom is accusing Harry of having basely imposed upon the
well-known imbecility of Dick. There is <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
something quite undemocratic in all men calling each other by the
special and affectionate term &ldquo;comrade&rdquo;; especially when
they say it with a sneer and smart inquiry about the funds. Democracy
would be quite satisfied if every man called every other man
&ldquo;sir.&rdquo; Democracy would have no conceivable reason to
complain if every man called every other man &ldquo;your
excellency&rdquo; or &ldquo;your holiness&rdquo; or &ldquo;brother of
the sun and moon.&rdquo; The only democratic essential is that it should
be a term of dignity and that it should be given to all. To abolish all
terms of dignity is no more specially democratic than the Roman
emperor&rsquo;s wish to cut off everybody&rsquo;s head at once was
specially democratic. That involved equality certainly, but it was
lacking in respect.</p>

<p>Dickens saw America as markedly the seat of this danger. He saw that
there was a perilous possibility that republican ideals might be allied
to a social anarchy good neither for them nor for any other ideals.
Republican simplicity, which is difficult, might be quickly turned into
Bohemian brutality, which is easy. Cincinnatus, instead of putting his
hand to the plough, might put his feet on the tablecloth, and an
impression prevail that it was all a part of the same rugged equality
and freedom. Insolence might become a tradition. Bad manners might have
all the sanctity of good manners. &ldquo;There you are!&rdquo; cries
Martin Chuzzlewit indignantly, when the American has befouled the
butter. &ldquo;A man deliberately makes a hog of himself and <i>that</i> is
an Institution.&rdquo; But the thread of thought which we must always
keep in hand in this matter is that he would not thus have worried about
the degradation <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
of republican simplicity into general rudeness if he had not from first
to last instinctively felt that America held human democracy in her
hand, to exalt it or to let it fall. In one of his gloomier moments he
wrote down his fear that the greatest blow ever struck at liberty would
be struck by America in the failure of her mission upon the earth.</p>

<p>This brings us to the other ground of his alarm&mdash;the matter of liberty
of speech. Here also he was much more reasonable and philosophic than
has commonly been realised. The truth is that the lurid individualism of
Carlyle has, with its violent colours, &ldquo;killed&rdquo; the tones of
most criticism of his time; and just as we can often see a scheme of
decoration better if we cover some flaming picture, so you can judge
nineteenth-century England much better if you leave Carlyle out. He is
important to moderns because he led that return to Toryism which has
been the chief feature of modernity, but his judgments were often not
only spiritually false, but really quite superficial. Dickens understood
the danger of democracy far better than Carlyle; just as he understood
the merits of democracy far better than Carlyle. And of this fact we can
produce one plain evidence in the matter of which we speak. Carlyle, in
his general dislike of the revolutionary movement, lumped liberty and
democracy together and said that the chief objection to democracy was
that it involved the excess and misuse of liberty; he called democracy
&ldquo;anarchy or no-rule.&rdquo; Dickens, with far more philosophical
insight and spiritual delicacy, saw that the real danger of democracy is
that it tends to the very opposite of anarchy; even to the very opposite
of liberty.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
He lamented in America the freedom of manners. But he lamented even
more the absence of freedom of opinion. &ldquo;I believe there is no
country on the face of the earth,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;where there is
less freedom of opinion on any subject in reference to which there is a
broad difference of opinion than in this. There! I write the words with
reluctance, disappointment, and sorrow; but I believe it from the bottom
of my soul. The notion that I, a man alone by myself in America, should
venture to suggest to the Americans that there was one point on which
they were neither just to their own countrymen nor to us, actually
struck the boldest dumb! Washington Irving, Prescott, Hoffman, Bryant,
Halleck, Dana, Washington Allston&mdash;every man who writes in this
country is devoted to the question, and not one of them <i>dares</i> to raise
his voice and complain of the atrocious state of the law. The wonder is
that a breathing man can be found with temerity enough to suggest to the
Americans the possibility of their having done wrong. I wish you could
have seen the faces that I saw down both sides of the table at Hartford
when I began to talk about Scott. I wish you could have heard how I gave
it out. My blood so boiled when I thought of the monstrous injustice
that I felt as if I were twelve feet high when I thrust it down their
throats.&rdquo; Dickens knew no history, but he had all history behind
him in feeling that a pure democracy does tend, when it goes wrong, to
be too traditional and absolute. The truth is indeed a singular example
of the unfair attack upon democracy in our own time. Everybody can
repeat the platitude that the mob can be the greatest of all tyrants.
But <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
few realise or remember the corresponding truth which goes along with
it&mdash;that the mob is the only permanent and unassailable high
priest. Democracy drives its traditions too hard; but democracy is the
only thing that keeps any traditions. An aristocracy must always be
going after some new thing. The severity of democracy is far more of a
virtue than its liberty. The decorum of a democracy is far more of a
danger than its lawlessness. Dickens discovered this in his great
quarrels about the copyright, when a whole nation acted on a small point
of opinion as if it were going to lynch him. But, fortunately for the
purpose of this argument, there is no need to go back to the forties for
such a case. Another great literary man has of late visited America; and
it is possible that Maxim Gorky may be in a position to state how far
democracy is likely to err on the side of mere liberty and laxity. He
may have found, like Dickens, some freedom of manners; he did not find
much freedom of morals.</p>

<p>Along with such American criticism should really go his very
characteristic summary of the question of the Red Indian. It marks the
combination between the mental narrowness and the moral justice of the
old Liberal. Dickens can see nothing in the Red Indian except that he is
barbaric, retrograde, bellicose, uncleanly, and superstitious&mdash;in short,
that he is not a member of the special civilisation of Birmingham or
Brighton. It is curious to note the contrast between the cheery, nay
Cockney, contempt with which Dickens speaks of the American Indian and
that chivalrous and pathetic essay in which Washington Irving celebrates
the virtues of the vanishing race. Between Washington<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
Irving and his friend Charles Dickens there was always indeed this
ironical comedy of inversion. It is amusing that the Englishman should
have been the pushing and even pert modernist, and the American the
stately antiquarian and lover of lost causes. But while a man of more
mellow sympathies may well dislike Dickens&rsquo;s dislike of savages,
and even disdain his disdain, he ought to sharply remind himself of the
admirable ethical fairness and equity which meet with that restricted
outlook. In the very act of describing Red Indians as devils who, like
so much dirt, it would pay us to sweep away, he pauses to deny
emphatically that we have any right to sweep them away. We have no right
to wrong the man, he means to say, even if he himself be a kind of
wrong. Here we strike the ringing iron of the old conscience and sense
of honour which marked the best men of his party and of his epoch. This
rigid and even reluctant justice towers, at any rate, far above modern
views of savages, above the sentimentalism of the mere humanitarian and
the far weaker sentimentalism that pleads for brutality and a race war.
Dickens was at least more of a man than the brutalitarian who claims to
wrong people because they are nasty, or the humanitarian who cannot be
just to them without pretending that they are nice.</p>

<h2><a name="ITALY" id="ITALY"></a>PICTURES FROM ITALY</h2>

<p>The <i>Pictures from Italy</i> are excellent in themselves and excellent as a
foil to the <i>American Notes</i>. Here we have none of that air of giving a
decision like a judge or sending in a report like an inspector; here we
have only glimpses, light and even fantastic glimpses, of a world that
is really alien to Dickens. It is so alien that he can almost entirely
enjoy it. For no man can entirely enjoy that which he loves; contentment
is always unpatriotic. The difference can indeed be put with approximate
perfection in one phrase. In Italy he was on a holiday; in America he
was on a tour. But indeed Dickens himself has quite sufficiently
conveyed the difference in the two phrases that he did actually use for
the titles of the two books. Dickens often told unconscious truths,
especially in small matters. The <i>American Notes</i> really are notes, like
the notes of a student or a professional witness. The <i>Pictures from
Italy</i> are only pictures from Italy, like the miscellaneous pictures
that all tourists bring from Italy.</p>

<p>To take another and perhaps closer figure of speech, almost all
Dickens&rsquo;s works such as these may best be regarded as private
letters addressed to the public. His private correspondence was quite as
brilliant as his public works; and many of his public works are almost
as formless and casual as his private correspondence.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
If he had been struck insensible for a year, I really think that his
friends and family could have brought out one of his best books by
themselves if they had happened to keep his letters. The homogeneity of
his public and private work was indeed strange in many ways. On the one
hand, there was little that was pompously and unmistakably public in the
publications; on the other hand, there was very little that was private
in the private letters. His hilarity had almost a kind of hardness about
it; no man&rsquo;s letters, I should think, ever needed less expurgation
on the ground of weakness or undue confession. The main part, and
certainly the best part, of such a book as <i>Pictures from Italy</i> can
certainly be criticised best as part of that perpetual torrent of
entertaining autobiography which he flung at his children as if they
were his readers and his readers as if they were his children. There are
some brilliant patches of sense and nonsense in this book; but there is
always something accidental in them; as if they might have occurred
somewhere else. Perhaps the most attractive of them is the incomparable
description of the Italian Marionette Theatre in which they acted a play
about the death of Napoleon in St. Helena. The description is better
than that of Codlin and Short&rsquo;s Punch and Judy, and almost as good
as that of Mrs. Jarley&rsquo;s Wax Works. Indeed the humour is similar;
for Punch is supposed to be funny, but Napoleon (as Mrs. Jarley said
when asked if her show was funnier than Punch) was not funny at all. The
idea of a really tragic scene being enacted between tiny wooden dolls
with large heads is delightfully dealt with by Dickens. We can almost
imagine <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
the scene in which the wooden Napoleon haughtily rebukes his wooden
jailor for calling him General Bonaparte&mdash;&ldquo;Sir Hudson Low,
call me not thus; I am Napoleon, Emperor of the French.&rdquo; There is
also something singularly gratifying about the scene of Napoleon&rsquo;s
death, in which he lay in bed with his little wooden hands outside the
counterpane and the doctor (who was hung on wires too short)
&ldquo;delivered medical opinions in the air.&rdquo; It may seem
flippant to dwell on such flippancies in connection with a book which
contains many romantic descriptions and many moral generalisations which
Dickens probably valued highly. But it is not for such things that he is
valued. In all his writings, from his most reasoned and sustained novel
to his maddest private note, it is always this obstreperous instinct for
farce which stands out as his in the highest sense. His wisdom is at the
best talent, his foolishness is genius. Just that exuberant levity which
we associate with a moment we associate in his case with immortality. It
is said of certain old masonry that the mortar was so hard that it has
survived the stones. So if Dickens could revisit the thing he built, he
would be surprised to see all the work he thought solid and responsible
wasted almost utterly away, but the shortest frivolities and the most
momentary jokes remaining like colossal rocks for ever.</p>

<h2><a name="CHUZZLEWIT" id="CHUZZLEWIT"></a>MARTIN CHUZZLEWIT</h2>

<p>There is a certain quality or element which broods over the whole of
<i>Martin Chuzzlewit</i> to which it is difficult for either friends or foes
to put a name. I think the reader who enjoys Dickens&rsquo;s other books
has an impression that it is a kind of melancholy. There are grotesque
figures of the most gorgeous kind; there are scenes that are farcical
even by the standard of the farcical license of Dickens; there is humour
both of the heaviest and of the lightest kind; there are two great comic
personalities who run like a rich vein through the whole story,
Pecksniff and Mrs. Gamp; there is one blinding patch of brilliancy, the
satire on American cant; there is Todgers&rsquo;s boarding-house; there
is Bailey; there is Mr. Mould, the incomparable undertaker. But yet in
spite of everything, in spite even of the undertaker, the book is sad.
No one I think ever went to it in that mixed mood of a tired tenderness
and a readiness to believe and laugh in which most of Dickens&rsquo;s
novels are most enjoyed. We go for a particular novel to Dickens as we
go for a particular inn. We go to the sign of the Pickwick Papers. We go
to the sign of the Rudge and Raven. We go to the sign of the Old
Curiosities. We go to the sign of the Two Cities. We go to each or all
of them according to what kind of hospitality and what kind of happiness
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
we require. But it is always some kind of hospitality and some kind
of happiness that we require. And as in the case of inns we also
remember that while there was shelter in all and food in all and some
kind of fire and some kind of wine in all, yet one has left upon us an
indescribable and unaccountable memory of mortality and decay, of
dreariness in the rooms and even of tastelessness in the banquet. So any
one who has enjoyed the stories of Dickens as they should be enjoyed has
a nameless feeling that this one story is sad and almost sodden. Dickens
himself had this feeling, though his breezy vanity forbade him to
express it in so many words. In spite of Pecksniff, in spite of Mrs.
Gamp, in spite of the yet greater Bailey, the story went lumberingly and
even lifelessly; he found the sales falling off; he fancied his
popularity waning, and by a sudden impulse most inartistic and yet most
artistic, he dragged in the episode of Martin&rsquo;s visit to America,
which is the blazing jewel and the sudden redemption of the book. He
wrote it at an uneasy and unhappy period of his life; when he had ceased
wandering in America, but could not cease wandering altogether; when he
had lost his original routine of work which was violent but regular, and
had not yet settled down to the full enjoyment of his success and his
later years. He poured into this book genius that might make the
mountains laugh, invention that juggled with the stars. But the book was
sad; and he knew it.</p>

<p>The just reason for this is really interesting. Yet it is one that is
not easy to state without guarding one&rsquo;s self on the one side or
the other against great misunderstandings; and these stipulations or
preliminary <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
allowances must in such a case as this of necessity be made first.
Dickens was among other things a satirist, a pure satirist. I have never
been able to understand why this title is always specially and sacredly
reserved for Thackeray. Thackeray was a novelist; in the strict and
narrow sense at any rate, Thackeray was a far greater novelist than
Dickens. But Dickens certainly was the satirist. The essence of satire
is that it perceives some absurdity inherent in the logic of some
position, and that it draws that absurdity out and isolates it, so that
all can see it. Thus for instance when Dickens says, &ldquo;Lord Coodle
would go out; Sir Thomas Doodle wouldn&rsquo;t come in; and there being
no people to speak of in England except Coodle and Doodle the country
has been without a Government&rdquo;; when Dickens says this he suddenly
pounces on and plucks out the one inherent absurdity in the English
party system which is hidden behind all its paraphernalia of Parliaments
and Statutes, elections and ballot papers. When all the dignity and all
the patriotism and all the public interest of the English constitutional
party conflict have been fully allowed for, there does remain the bold,
bleak question which Dickens in substance asks, &ldquo;Suppose I want
somebody else who is neither Coodle nor Doodle.&rdquo; This is the great
quality called satire; it is a kind of taunting reasonableness; and it
is inseparable from a certain insane logic which is often called
exaggeration. Dickens was more of a satirist than Thackeray for this
simple reason: that Thackeray carried a man&rsquo;s principles as far as
that man carried them; Dickens carried a man&rsquo;s principles as far
as a man&rsquo;s principles would go. Dickens in short (as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
people put it) exaggerated the man and his principles; that is to say
he emphasised them. Dickens drew a man&rsquo;s absurdity out of him;
Thackeray left a man&rsquo;s absurdity in him. Of this last fact we can
take any example we like; take for instance the comparison between the
city man as treated by Thackeray in the most satiric of his novels, with
the city man as treated by Dickens in one of the mildest and maturest of
his. Compare the character of old Mr. Osborne in <i>Vanity Fair</i> with the
character of Mr. Podsnap in <i>Our Mutual Friend</i>. In the case of Mr.
Osborne there is nothing except the solid blocking in of a brutal dull
convincing character. <i>Vanity Fair</i> is not a satire on the City except
in so far as it happens to be true. <i>Vanity Fair</i> is not a satire on the
City, in short, except in so far as the City is a satire on the City.
But Mr. Podsnap is a pure satire; he is an extracting out of the City
man of those purely intellectual qualities which happen to make that
kind of City man a particularly exasperating fool. One might almost say
that Mr. Podsnap is all Mr. Osborne&rsquo;s opinions separated from Mr.
Osborne and turned into a character. In short the satirist is more
purely philosophical than the novelist. The novelist may be only an
observer; the satirist must be a thinker. He must be a thinker, he must
be a philosophical thinker for this simple reason; that he exercises his
philosophical thought in deciding what part of his subject he is to
satirise. You may have the dullest possible intelligence and be a
portrait painter; but a man must have a serious intellect in order to be
a caricaturist. He has to select what thing he will caricature. True
satire is always of this intellectual <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
kind; true satire is always, so to speak, a variation or fantasia upon
the air of pure logic. The satirist is the man who carries men&rsquo;s
enthusiasm further than they carry it themselves. He outstrips the most
extravagant fanatic. He is years ahead of the most audacious prophet. He
sees where men&rsquo;s detached intellect will eventually lead them, and
he tells them the name of the place&mdash;which is generally hell.</p>

<p>Now of this detached and rational use of satire there is one great
example in this book. Even <i>Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels</i> is hardly more
reasonable than Martin Chuzzlewit&rsquo;s travels in the incredible land
of the Americans. Before considering the humour of this description in
its more exhaustive and liberal aspects, it may be first remarked that
in this American part of <i>Martin Chuzzlewit</i>, Dickens quite specially
sharpens up his own more controversial and political intelligence. There
are more things here than anywhere else in Dickens that partake of the
nature of pamphleteering, of positive challenge, of sudden repartee, of
pugnacious and exasperating query, in a word of everything that belongs
to the pure art of controversy as distinct not only from the pure art of
fiction but even also from the pure art of satire. I am inclined to
think (to put the matter not only shortly but clumsily) that Dickens was
never in all his life so strictly clever as he is in the American part
of <i>Martin Chuzzlewit</i>. There are places where he was more inspired,
almost in the sense of being intoxicated, as, for instance, in the
Micawber feasts of <i>David Copperfield</i>; there are places where he wrote
more carefully and cunningly, as, for instance, in the mystery of <i>The
Mystery of Edwin Drood</i>; there are places where <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
he wrote very much more humanly, more close to the ground and to
growing things, as in the whole of that admirable book <i>Great
Expectations</i>. But I do not think that his mere abstract acuteness and
rapidity of thought were ever exercised with such startling exactitude
as they are in this place in <i>Martin Chuzzlewit</i>. It is to be noted, for
instance, that his American experience had actually worked him up to a
heat and habit of argument. A slave-owner in the Southern States tells
Dickens that slave-owners do not ill-treat their slaves, that it is not
to the interest of slave-owners to ill-treat their slaves. Dickens
flashes back that it is not to the interest of a man to get drunk, but
he does get drunk. This pugnacious atmosphere of parry and riposte must
first of all be allowed for and understood in all the satiric excursus
of Martin in America. Dickens is arguing all the time; and, to do him
justice, arguing very well. These chapters are full not merely of
exuberant satire on America in the sense that Dotheboys Hall or Mr.
Bumble&rsquo;s Workhouse are exuberant satires on England. They are full
also of sharp argument with America as if the man who wrote expected
retort and was prepared with rejoinder. The rest of the book, like the
rest of Dickens&rsquo;s books, possesses humour. This part of the book,
like hardly any of Dickens&rsquo;s books, possesses wit. The republican
gentleman who receives Martin on landing is horrified on hearing an
English servant speak of the employer as &ldquo;the master.&rdquo;
&ldquo;There are no masters in America,&rdquo; says the gentleman.
&ldquo;All owners are they?&rdquo; says Martin. This sort of verbal
promptitude is out of the ordinary scope of Dickens; but we find it
frequently <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
in this particular part of <i>Martin Chuzzlewit</i>. Martin himself is
constantly breaking out into a controversial lucidity, which is
elsewhere not at all a part of his character. When they talk to him
about the institutions of America he asks sarcastically whether bowie
knives and swordsticks and revolvers are the institutions of America.
All this (if I may summarise) is expressive of one main fact. Being a
satirist means being a philosopher. Dickens was not always very
philosophical; but he had this permanent quality of the philosopher
about him, that he always remembered people by their opinions. Elijah
Pogram was to him the man who said that &ldquo;his boastful answer to
the tyrant and the despot was that his bright home was the land of the
settin&rsquo; sun.&rdquo; Mr. Scadder and Mr. Jefferson Brick were to
him the men who said (in cooperation) that &ldquo;the libation of
freedom must sometimes be quaffed in blood.&rdquo; And in these chapters
more than anywhere else he falls into the extreme habit of satire, that
of treating people as if there were nothing about them except their
opinions. It is therefore difficult to accept these pages as pages in a
novel, splendid as they are considered as pages in a parody. I do not
dispute that men have said and do say that &ldquo;the libation of
freedom must sometimes be quaffed in blood,&rdquo; that &ldquo;their
bright homes are the land of the settin&rsquo; sun,&rdquo; that
&ldquo;they taunt that lion,&rdquo; that &ldquo;alone they dare
him,&rdquo; or &ldquo;that softly sleeps the calm ideal in the
whispering chambers of imagination.&rdquo; I have read too much American
journalism to deny that any of these sentences and any of these opinions
may at some time or other have been uttered. I do not deny
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
that there are such opinions. But I do deny that there are such people.
Elijah Pogram had some other business in life besides defending
defaulting postmasters; he must have been a son or a father or a husband
or at least (admirable thought) a lover. Mr. Chollop had some moments in
his existence when he was not threatening his fellow-creatures with his
sword-stick and his revolver. Of all this human side of such American
types Dickens does not really give any hint at all. He does not suggest
that the bully Chollop had even such coarse good-humour as bullies
almost always have. He does not suggest that the humbug Elijah Pogram
had even as much greasy amiability as humbugs almost invariably have. He
is not studying them as human beings, even as bad human beings; he is
studying them as conceptions, as points of view, as symbols of a state
of mind with which he is in violent disagreement. To put it roughly, he
is not describing characters, he is satirising fads. To put it more
exactly, he is not describing characters; he is persecuting heresies.
There is one thing really to be said against his American satire; it is
a serious thing to be said: it is an argument, and it is true. This can
be said of Martin&rsquo;s wanderings in America, that from the time he
lands in America to the time he sets sail from it he never meets a
living man. He has travelled in the land of Laputa. All the people he
has met have been absurd opinions walking about. The whole art of
Dickens in such passages as these consisted in one thing. It consisted
in finding an opinion that had not a leg to stand on, and then giving it
two legs to stand on.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
So much may be allowed; it may be admitted that Dickens is in this sense
the great satirist, in that he can imagine absurd opinions walking by
themselves about the street. It may be admitted that Thackeray would not
have allowed an absurd opinion to walk about the street without at least
tying a man on to it for the sake of safety. But while this first truth
may be evident, the second truth which is the complement of it may
easily be forgotten. On the one hand there was no man who could so much
enjoy mere intellectual satire apart from humanity as Dickens. On the
other hand there was no man who, with another and more turbulent part of
his nature, demanded humanity, and demanded its supremacy over
intellect, more than Dickens. To put it shortly: there never was a man
so much fitted for saying that everything was wrong; and there never was
a man who was so desirous of saying that everything was right. Thus,
when he met men with whom he violently disagreed, he described them as
devils or lunatics; he could not bear to describe them as men. If they
could not think with him on essentials he could not stand the idea that
they were human souls; he cast them out; he forgot them; and if he could
not forget them he caricatured them. He was too emotional to regard them
as anything but enemies, if they were not friends. He was too humane not
to hate them. Charles Lamb said with his inimitable sleek pungency that
he could read all the books there were; he excluded books that obviously
were not books, as cookery books, chessboards bound so as to look like
books, and all the works of modern historians and philosophers. One
might say in much the same <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
style that Dickens loved all the men in the world; that is he loved all
the men whom he was able to recognise as men; the rest he turned into
griffins and chimeras without any serious semblance to humanity. Even in
his books he never hates a human being. If he wishes to hate him he
adopts the simple expedient of making him an inhuman being. Now of these
two strands almost the whole of Dickens is made up; they are not only
different strands, they are even antagonistic strands. I mean that the
whole of Dickens is made up of the strand of satire and the strand of
sentimentalism; and the strand of satire is quite unnecessarily
merciless and hostile, and the strand of sentimentalism is quite
unnecessarily humanitarian and even maudlin. On the proper interweaving
of these two things depends the great part of Dickens&rsquo;s success in
a novel. And by the consideration of them we can probably best arrive at
the solution of the particular emotional enigma of the novel called
<i>Martin Chuzzlewit</i>.</p>

<p><i>Martin Chuzzlewit</i> is, I think, vaguely unsatisfactory to the reader,
vaguely sad and heavy even to the reader who loves Dickens, because in
<i>Martin Chuzzlewit</i> more than anywhere else in Dickens&rsquo;s works,
more even than in <i>Oliver Twist</i>, there is a predominance of the harsh
and hostile sort of humour over the hilarious and the humane. It is
absurd to lay down any such little rules for the testing of literature.
But this may be broadly said and yet with confidence: that Dickens is
always at his best when he is laughing at the people whom he really
admires. He is at his most humorous in writing of Mr. Pickwick, who
represents passive virtue. He is at his most humorous in writing of Mr.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
Sam Weller, who represents active virtue. He is never so funny as when
he is speaking of people in whom fun itself is a virtue, like the poor
people in the Fleet or the Marshalsea. And in the stories that had
immediately preceded <i>Martin Chuzzlewit</i> he had consistently concerned
himself in the majority of cases with the study of such genial and
honourable eccentrics; if they are lunatics they are amiable lunatics.
In the last important novel before <i>Martin Chuzzlewit</i>, <i>Barnaby Rudge</i>,
the hero himself is an amiable lunatic. In the novel before that, <i>The
Old Curiosity Shop</i>, the two comic figures, Dick Swiveller and the
Marchioness, are not only the most really entertaining, but also the
most really sympathetic characters in the book. Before that came <i>Oliver
Twist</i> (which is, I have said, an exception), and before that
<i>Pickwick</i>, where the hero is, as Mr. Weller says, &ldquo;an angel in
gaiters.&rdquo; Hitherto, then, on the whole, the central Dickens
character had been the man who gave to the poor many things, gold and
wine and feasting and good advice; but among other things gave them a
good laugh at himself. The jolly old English merchant of the Pickwick
type was popular on both counts. People liked to see him throw his money
in the gutter. They also liked to see him throw himself there
occasionally. In both acts they recognised a common quality of virtue.</p>

<p>Now I think it is certainly the disadvantage of <i>Martin Chuzzlewit</i> that
none of its absurd characters are thus sympathetic. There are in the
book two celebrated characters who are both especially exuberant and
amusing even for Dickens, and who are both especially heartless and
abominable even for Dickens&mdash;I <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
mean of course Mr. Pecksniff on the one hand and Mrs. Gamp on the
other. The humour of both of them is gigantesque. Nobody will ever
forget the first time he read the words &ldquo;Now I should be very glad
to see Mrs. Todgers&rsquo;s idea of a wooden leg.&rdquo; It is like
remembering first love: there is still some sort of ancient sweetness
and sting. I am afraid that, in spite of many criticisms to the
contrary, I am still unable to take Mr. Pecksniff&rsquo;s hypocrisy
seriously. He does not seem to me so much a hypocrite as a rhetorician;
he reminds me of Serjeant Buzfuz. A very capable critic, Mr. Noyes, said
that I was wrong when I suggested in another place that Dickens must
have loved Pecksniff. Mr. Noyes thinks it clear that Dickens hated
Pecksniff. I cannot believe it. Hatred does indeed linger round its
object as much as love; but not in that way. Dickens is always making
Pecksniff say things which have a wild poetical truth about them. Hatred
allows no such outbursts of original innocence. But however that may be
the broad fact remains&mdash;Dickens may or may not have loved Pecksniff
comically, but he did not love him seriously; he did not respect him as
he certainly respected Sam Weller. The same of course is true of Mrs.
Gamp. To any one who appreciates her unctuous and sumptuous conversation
it is difficult indeed not to feel that it would be almost better to be
killed by Mrs. Gamp than to be saved by a better nurse. But the fact
remains. In this book Dickens has not allowed us to love the most absurd
people seriously, and absurd people ought to be loved seriously.
Pecksniff has to be amusing all the time; the instant he ceases to be
laughable he becomes <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
detestable. Pickwick can take his ease at his inn; he can be leisurely,
he can be spacious; he can fall into moods of gravity and even of
dulness; he is not bound to be always funny or to forfeit the
reader&rsquo;s concern, for he is a good man, and therefore even his
dulness is beautiful, just as is the dulness of the animal. We can leave
Pickwick a little while by the fire to think; for the thoughts of
Pickwick, even if they were to go slowly, would be full of all the
things that all men care for&mdash;old friends and old inns and memory
and the goodness of God. But we dare not leave Pecksniff alone for a
moment. We dare not leave him thinking by the fire, for the thoughts of
Pecksniff would be too frightful.</p>

<h2><a name="CHRISTMAS_BOOKS" id="CHRISTMAS_BOOKS"></a>CHRISTMAS BOOKS</h2>

<p>The mystery of Christmas is in a manner identical with the mystery of
Dickens. If ever we adequately explain the one we may adequately explain
the other. And indeed, in the treatment of the two, the chronological or
historical order must in some degree be remembered. Before we come to
the question of what Dickens did for Christmas we must consider the
question of what Christmas did for Dickens. How did it happen that this
bustling, nineteenth-century man, full of the almost cock-sure
common-sense of the utilitarian and liberal epoch, came to associate his
name chiefly in literary history with the perpetuation of a half pagan
and half Catholic festival which he would certainly have called an
antiquity and might easily have called a superstition? Christmas has
indeed been celebrated before in English literature; but it had, in the
most noticeable cases, been celebrated in connection with that kind of
feudalism with which Dickens would have severed his connection with an
ignorant and even excessive scorn. Sir Roger de Coverley kept Christmas;
but it was a feudal Christmas. Sir Walter Scott sang in praise of
Christmas; but it was a feudal Christmas. And Dickens was not only
indifferent to the dignity of the old country gentleman or to the genial
arch&aelig;ology of Scott; <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
he was even harshly and insolently hostile to it. If Dickens had lived
in the neighbourhood of Sir Roger de Coverley he would undoubtedly, like
Tom Touchy, have been always &ldquo;having the law of him.&rdquo; If
Dickens had stumbled in among the old armour and quaint folios of
Scott&rsquo;s study he would certainly have read his brother novelist a
lesson in no measured terms about the futility of thus fumbling in the
dust-bins of old oppression and error. So far from Dickens being one of
those who like a thing because it is old, he was one of those cruder
kind of reformers, in theory at least, who actually dislike a thing
because it is old. He was not merely the more righteous kind of Radical
who tries to uproot abuses; he was partly also that more suicidal kind
of Radical who tries to uproot himself. In theory at any rate, he had no
adequate conception of the importance of human tradition; in his time it
had been twisted and falsified into the form of an opposition to
democracy. In truth, of course, tradition is the most democratic of all
things, for tradition is merely a democracy of the dead as well as the
living. But Dickens and his special group or generation had no grasp of
this permanent position; they had been called to a special war for the
righting of special wrongs. In so far as such an institution as
Christmas was old, Dickens would even have tended to despise it. He
could never have put the matter to himself in the correct way&mdash;that
while there are some things whose antiquity does prove that they are
dying, there are some other things whose antiquity only proves that they
cannot die. If some Radical contemporary and friend of Dickens had
happened to say to him that in defending <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
the mince-pies and the mummeries of Christmas he was defending a piece
of barbaric and brutal ritualism, doomed to disappear in the light of
reason along with the Boy-Bishop and the Lord of Misrule, I am not sure
that Dickens (though he was one of the readiest and most rapid masters
of reply in history) would have found it very easy upon his own
principles to answer. It was by a great ancestral instinct that he
defended Christmas; by that sacred sub-consciousness which is called
tradition, which some have called a dead thing, but which is really a
thing far more living than the intellect. There is a dark kinship and
brotherhood of all mankind which is much too deep to be called heredity
or to be in any way explained in scientific formul&aelig;; blood is
thicker than water and is especially very much thicker than water on the
brain. But this unconscious and even automatic quality in
Dickens&rsquo;s defence of the Christmas feast, this fact that his
defence might almost be called animal rather than mental, though in
proper language it should be called merely virile; all this brings us
back to the fact that we must begin with the atmosphere of the subject
itself. We must not ask Dickens what Christmas is, for with all his heat
and eloquence he does not know. Rather we must ask Christmas what
Dickens is&mdash;ask how this strange child of Christmas came to be born
out of due time.</p>

<p>Dickens devoted his genius in a somewhat special sense to the
description of happiness. No other literary man of his eminence has made
this central human aim so specially his subject matter. Happiness is a
mystery&mdash;generally a momentary mystery&mdash;which seldom stops long enough
to submit itself to artistic observation, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
and which, even when it is habitual, has something about it which
renders artistic description almost impossible. There are twenty tiny
minor poets who can describe fairly impressively an eternity of agony;
there are very few even of the eternal poets who can describe ten
minutes of satisfaction. Nevertheless, mankind being half divine is
always in love with the impossible, and numberless attempts have been
made from the beginning of human literature to describe a real state of
felicity. Upon the whole, I think, the most successful have been the
most frankly physical and symbolic; the flowers of Eden or the jewels of
the New Jerusalem. Many writers, for instance, have called the gold and
chrysolite of the Holy City a vulgar lump of jewellery. But when these
critics themselves attempt to describe their conceptions of future
happiness, it is always some priggish nonsense about
&ldquo;planes,&rdquo; about &ldquo;cycles of fulfilment,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;spirals of spiritual evolution.&rdquo; Now a cycle is just as
much a physical metaphor as a flower of Eden; a spiral is just as much a
physical metaphor as a precious stone. But, after all, a garden is a
beautiful thing; whereas this is by no means necessarily true of a
cycle, as can be seen in the case of a bicycle. A jewel, after all, is a
beautiful thing; but this is not necessarily so of a spiral, as can be
seen in the case of a corkscrew. Nothing is gained by dropping the old
material metaphors, which did hint at heavenly beauty, and adopting
other material metaphors which do not even give a hint of earthly
beauty. This modern or spiral method of describing indescribable
happiness may, I think, be dismissed. Then there has been another method
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
which has been adopted by many men of a very real poetical genius. It
was the method of the old pastoral poets like Theocritus. It was in
another way that adopted by the elegance and piety of Spenser. It was
certainly expressed in the pictures of Watteau; and it had a very
sympathetic and even manly expression in modern England in the
decorative poetry of William Morris. These men of genius, from
Theocritus to Morris, occupied themselves in endeavouring to describe
happiness as a state of certain human beings, the atmosphere of a
commonwealth, the enduring climate of certain cities or islands. They
poured forth treasures of the truest kind of imagination upon describing
the happy lives and landscapes of Utopia or Atlantis or the Earthly
Paradise. They traced with the most tender accuracy the tracery of its
fruit-trees or the glimmering garments of its women; they used every
ingenuity of colour or intricate shape to suggest its infinite delight.
And what they succeeded in suggesting was always its infinite
melancholy. William Morris described the Earthly Paradise in such a way
that the only strong emotional note left on the mind was the feeling of
how homeless his travellers felt in that alien Elysium; and the reader
sympathised with them, feeling that he would prefer not only Elizabethan
England but even twentieth-century Camberwell to such a land of shining
shadows. Thus literature has almost always failed in endeavouring to
describe happiness as a state. Human tradition, human custom and
folk-lore (though far more true and reliable than literature as a rule)
have not often succeeded in giving quite the correct symbols for a real
atmosphere of <i>camaraderie</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
and joy. But here and there the note has been struck with the sudden
vibration of the <i>vox humana</i>. In human tradition it has been struck
chiefly in the old celebrations of Christmas. In literature it has been
struck chiefly in Dickens&rsquo;s Christmas tales.</p>

<p>In the historic celebration of Christmas as it remains from Catholic
times in certain northern countries (and it is to be remembered that in
Catholic times the northern countries were, if possible, more Catholic
than anybody else), there are three qualities which explain, I think,
its hold upon the human sense of happiness, especially in such men as
Dickens. There are three notes of Christmas, so to speak, which are also
notes of happiness, and which the pagans and the Utopians forget. If we
state what they are in the case of Christmas, it will be quite
sufficiently obvious how important they are in the case of Dickens.</p>

<p>The first quality is what may be called the dramatic quality. The
happiness is not a state; it is a crisis. All the old customs
surrounding the celebration of the birth of Christ are made by human
instinct so as to insist and re-insist upon this crucial quality.
Everything is so arranged that the whole household may feel, if
possible, as a household does when a child is actually being born in it.
The thing is a vigil and a vigil with a definite limit. People sit up at
night until they hear the bells ring. Or they try to sleep at night in
order to see their presents the next morning. Everywhere there is a
limitation, a restraint; at one moment the door is shut, at the moment
after it is opened. The hour has come or it has not come; the parcels
are undone or they are not undone; there is no evolution of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
Christmas presents. This sharp and theatrical quality in pleasure,
which human instinct and the mother wit of the world has wisely put into
the popular celebrations of Christmas, is also a quality which is
essential in such romantic literature as Dickens wrote. In romantic
literature the hero and heroine must indeed be happy, but they must also
be unexpectedly happy. This is the first connecting link between
literature and the old religious feast; this is the first connecting
link between Dickens and Christmas.</p>

<p>The second element to be found in all such festivity and all such
romance is the element which is represented as well as it could be
represented by the mere fact that Christmas occurs in the winter. It is
the element not merely of contrast, but actually of antagonism. It
preserves everything that was best in the merely primitive or pagan view
of such ceremonies or such banquets. If we are carousing, at least we
are warriors carousing. We hang above us, as it were, the shields and
battle-axes with which we must do battle with the giants of the snow and
hail. All comfort must be based on discomfort. Man chooses when he
wishes to be most joyful the very moment when the whole material
universe is most sad. It is this contradiction and mystical defiance
which gives a quality of manliness and reality to the old winter feasts
which is not characteristic of the sunny felicities of the Earthly
Paradise. And this curious element has been carried out even in all the
trivial jokes and tasks that have always surrounded such occasions as
these. The object of the jovial customs was not to make everything
artificially easy: on the contrary, it was rather to make everything
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
artificially difficult. Idealism is not only expressed by shooting an
arrow at the stars; the fundamental principle of idealism is also
expressed by putting a leg of mutton at the top of a greasy pole. There
is in all such observances a quality which can be called only the
quality of divine obstruction. For instance, in the game of snapdragon
(that admirable occupation) the conception is that raisins taste much
nicer if they are brands saved from the burning. About all Christmas
things there is something a little nobler, if only nobler in form and
theory, than mere comfort; even holly is prickly. It is not hard to see
the connection of this kind of historic instinct with a romantic writer
like Dickens. The healthy novelist must always play snapdragon with his
principal characters; he must always be snatching the hero and heroine
like raisins out of the fire.</p>

<p>The third great Christmas element is the element of the grotesque. The
grotesque is the natural expression of joy; and all the Utopias and new
Edens of the poets fail to give a real impression of enjoyment, very
largely because they leave out the grotesque. A man in most modern
Utopias cannot really be happy; he is too dignified. A man in
Morris&rsquo;s Earthly Paradise cannot really be enjoying himself; he is
too decorative. When real human beings have real delights they tend to
express them entirely in grotesques&mdash;I might almost say entirely in
goblins. On Christmas Eve one may talk about ghosts so long as they are
turnip ghosts. But one would not be allowed (I hope, in any decent
family) to talk on Christmas Eve about astral bodies. The boar&rsquo;s
head of old Yule-time was as grotesque as <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
the donkey&rsquo;s head of Bottom the Weaver. But there is only one set
of goblins quite wild enough to express the wild goodwill of Christmas.
Those goblins are the characters of Dickens.</p>

<p>Arcadian poets and Arcadian painters have striven to express happiness
by means of beautiful figures. Dickens understood that happiness is best
expressed by ugly figures. In beauty, perhaps, there is something allied
to sadness; certainly there is something akin to joy in the grotesque,
nay, in the uncouth. There is something mysteriously associated with
happiness not only in the corpulence of Falstaff and the corpulence of
Tony Weller, but even in the red nose of Bardolph or the red nose of Mr.
Stiggins. A thing of beauty is an inspiration for ever&mdash;a matter of
meditation for ever. It is rather a thing of ugliness that is strictly a
joy for ever.</p>

<p>All Dickens&rsquo;s books are Christmas books. But this is still truest
of his two or three famous Yuletide tales&mdash;The <i>Christmas Carol</i> and
<i>The Chimes</i> and <i>The Cricket on the Hearth</i>. Of these <i>The Christmas
Carol</i> is beyond comparison the best as well as the most popular.
Indeed, Dickens is in so profound and spiritual a sense a popular author
that in his case, unlike most others, it can generally be said that the
best work is the most popular. It is for <i>Pickwick</i> that he is best
known; and upon the whole it is for Pickwick that he is best worth
knowing. In any case this superiority of <i>The Christmas Carol</i> makes it
convenient for us to take it as an example of the generalisations
already made. If we study the very real atmosphere of rejoicing and of
riotous charity in <i>The Christmas Carol</i> we shall find
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
that all the three marks I have mentioned are unmistakably visible.
<i>The Christmas Carol</i> is a happy story first, because it describes an
abrupt and dramatic change. It is not only the story of a conversion,
but of a sudden conversion; as sudden as the conversion of a man at a
Salvation Army meeting. Popular religion is quite right in insisting on
the fact of a crisis in most things. It is true that the man at the
Salvation Army meeting would probably be converted from the punch bowl;
whereas Scrooge was converted to it. That only means that Scrooge and
Dickens represented a higher and more historic Christianity.</p>

<p>Again, <i>The Christmas Carol</i> owes much of its hilarity to our second
source&mdash;the fact of its being a tale of winter and of a very wintry
winter. There is much about comfort in the story; yet the comfort is
never enervating: it is saved from that by a tingle of something bitter
and bracing in the weather. Lastly, the story exemplifies throughout the
power of the third principle&mdash;the kinship between gaiety and the
grotesque. Everybody is happy because nobody is dignified. We have a
feeling somehow that Scrooge looked even uglier when he was kind than he
had looked when he was cruel. The turkey that Scrooge bought was so fat,
says Dickens, that it could never have stood upright. That top-heavy and
monstrous bird is a good symbol of the top-heavy happiness of the
stories.</p>

<p>It is less profitable to criticise the other two tales in detail because
they represent variations on the theme in two directions; and variations
that were not, upon the whole, improvements. <i>The Chimes</i> is a monument
of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
Dickens&rsquo;s honourable quality of pugnacity. He could not admire
anything, even peace, without wanting to be warlike about it. That was
all as it should be.</p>

<hr /><p class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></p>
<h2><a name="DOMBEY" id="DOMBEY"></a>DOMBEY AND SON</h2>

<p>In Dickens&rsquo;s literary life <i>Dombey and Son</i> represents a break so
important as to necessitate our casting back to a summary and a
generalisation. In order fully to understand what this break is, we must
say something of the previous character of Dickens&rsquo;s novels, and
even something of the general character of novels in themselves. How
essential this is we shall see shortly.</p>

<p>It must first be remembered that the novel is the most typical of modern
forms. It is typical of modern forms especially in this, that it is
essentially formless. All the ancient modes or structures of literature
were definite and severe. Any one composing them had to abide by their
rules; they were what their name implied. Thus a tragedy might be a bad
tragedy, but it was always a tragedy. Thus an epic might be a bad epic,
but it was always an epic. Now in the sense in which there is such a
thing as an epic, in that sense there is no such thing as a novel. We
call any long fictitious narrative in prose a novel, just as we call any
short piece of prose without any narrative an essay. Both these forms
are really quite formless, and both of them are really quite new. The
difference between a good epic by Mr. John Milton and a bad epic by Mr.
John Smith was simply the difference between the same thing done
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
well and the same thing done badly. But it was not (for instance) like
the difference between <i>Clarissa Harlowe</i> and <i>The Time Machine</i>. If we
class Richardson&rsquo;s book with Mr. Wells&rsquo;s book it is really
only for convenience; if we say that they are both novels we shall
certainly be puzzled in that case to say what on earth a novel is. But
the note of our age, both for good and evil, is a highly poetical and
largely illogical faith in liberty. Liberty is not a negation or a piece
of nonsense, as the cheap reactionaries say; it is a belief in variety
and growth. But it is a purely poetic and even a merely romantic belief.
The nineteenth century was an age of romance as certainly as the Middle
Ages was an age of reason. Medi&aelig;vals liked to have everything
defined and defensible; the modern world prefers to run some risks for
the sake of spontaneity and diversity. Consequently the modern world is
full of a phenomenon peculiar to itself&mdash;I mean the spectacle of
small or originally small things swollen to enormous size and power. The
modern world is like a world in which toadstools should be as big as
trees, and insects should walk about in the sun as large as elephants.
Thus, for instance, the shopkeeper, almost an unimportant figure in
carefully ordered states, has in our time become the millionaire, and
has more power than ten kings. Thus again a practical knowledge of
nature, of the habits of animals or the properties of fire and water,
was in the old ordered state either an almost servile labour or a sort
of joke; it was left to old women and gamekeepers and boys who went
birds&rsquo;-nesting. In our time this commonplace daily knowledge has
swollen into the enormous miracle of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
physical size, weighing the stars and talking under the sea. In short,
our age is a sort of splendid jungle in which some of the most towering
weeds and blossoms have come from the smallest seed.</p>

<p>And this is, generally speaking, the explanation of the novel. The novel
is not so much the filling up of an artistic plan, however new or
fantastic. It is a thing that has grown from some germ of suggestion,
and has often turned out much larger than the author intended. And this,
lastly, is the final result of these facts, that the critic can
generally trace in a novel what was the original artistic type or shape
of thought from which the whole matter started, and he will generally
find that this is different in every case. In one novel he will find
that the first impulse is a character. In another novel he will find
that the first impulse is a landscape, the atmosphere of some special
countryside. In another novel he will find that the first impulse is the
last chapter. Or it may be a thrust with sword or dagger, it may be a
theology, it may be a song. Somewhere embedded in every ordinary book
are the five or six words for which really all the rest will be written.
Some of our enterprising editors who set their readers to hunt for
banknotes and missing ladies might start a competition for finding those
words in every novel. But whether or no this is possible, there is no
doubt that the principle in question is of great importance in the case
of Dickens, and especially in the case of <i>Dombey and Son</i>.</p>

<p>In all the Dickens novels can be seen, so to speak, the original thing
that they were before they were novels. The same may be observed, for
the matter of that, in <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
the great novels of most of the great modern novelists. For example,
Sir Walter Scott wrote poetical romances before he wrote prose romances.
Hence it follows that, with all their much greater merit, his novels may
still be described as poetical romances in prose. While adding a new and
powerful element of popular humours and observation, Scott still retains
a certain purely poetical right&mdash;a right to make his heroes and
outlaws and great kings speak at the great moments with a rhetoric so
rhythmical that it partakes of the nature of song, the same quite
metrical rhetoric which is used in the metrical speeches of Marmion or
Roderick Dhu. In the same way, although <i>Don Quixote</i> is a modern novel
in its irony and subtlety, we can see that it comes from the old long
romances of chivalry. In the same way, although <i>Clarissa</i> is a modern
novel in its intimacy and actuality, we can see that it comes from the
old polite letter-writing and polite essays of the period of the
<i>Spectator</i>. Any one can see that Scott formed in <i>The Lay of the Last
Minstrel</i> the style that he applied again and again afterwards, like the
reappearances of a star taking leave of the stage. All his other
romances were positively last appearances of the positively last
Minstrel. Any one can see that Thackeray formed in fragmentary satires
like <i>The Book of Snobs</i> or <i>The Yellowplush Papers</i> the style, the
rather fragmentary style, in which he was to write <i>Vanity Fair</i>. In
most modern cases, in short (until very lately, at any rate), the novel
is an enormous outgrowth from something that was not a novel. And in
Dickens this is very important. All his novels are outgrowths of the
original notion of taking notes, splendid and <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
inspired notes, of what happens in the street. Those in the modern
world who cannot reconcile themselves to his method&mdash;those who feel
that there is about his books something intolerably clumsy or
superficial&mdash;have either no natural taste for strong literature at
all, or else have fallen into their error by too persistently regarding
Dickens as a modern novelist and expecting all his books to be modern
novels. Dickens did not know at what exact point he really turned into a
novelist. Nor do we. Dickens did not know, in his deepest soul, whether
he ever really did turn into a novelist. Nor do we. The novel being a
modern product is one of the few things to which we really can apply
that disgusting method of thought&mdash;the method of evolution. But
even in evolution there are great gaps, there are great breaks, there
are great crises. I have said that the first of these breaks in Dickens
may be placed at the point when he wrote <i>Nicholas Nickleby</i>. This was
his first serious decision to be a novelist in any sense at all, to be
anything except a maker of momentary farces. The second break, and that
a far more important break, is in <i>Dombey and Son</i>. This marks his final
resolution to be a novelist and nothing else, to be a serious
constructor of fiction in the serious sense. Before <i>Dombey and Son</i>
even his pathos had been really frivolous. After <i>Dombey and Son</i> even
his absurdity was intentional and grave.</p>

<p>In case this transition is not understood, one or two tests may be taken
at random. The episodes in <i>Dombey and Son</i>, the episodes in <i>David
Copperfield</i>, which came after it, are no longer episodes merely stuck
into the middle of the story without any connection <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
with it, like most of the episodes in <i>Nicholas Nickleby</i>, or most of
the episodes even in <i>Martin Chuzzlewit</i>. Take, for instance, by way of
a mere coincidence, the fact that three schools for boys are described
successively in <i>Nicholas Nickleby</i>, in <i>Dombey and Son</i>, and in <i>David
Copperfield</i>. But the difference is enormous. Dotheboys Hall does not
exist to tell us anything about Nicholas Nickleby. Rather Nicholas
Nickleby exists entirely in order to tell us about Dotheboys Hall. It
does not in any way affect his history or psychology; he enters Mr.
Squeers&rsquo;s school and leaves Mr. Squeers&rsquo;s school with the
same character, or rather absence of character. It is a mere episode,
existing for itself. But when little Paul Dombey goes to an
old-fashioned but kindly school, it is in a very different sense and for
a very different reason from that for which Nicholas Nickleby goes to an
old-fashioned and cruel school. The sending of little Paul to Dr.
Blimber&rsquo;s is a real part of the history of little Paul, such as it
is. Dickens deliberately invents all that elderly pedantry in order to
show up Paul&rsquo;s childishness. Dickens deliberately invents all that
rather heavy kindness in order to show up Paul&rsquo;s predestination
and tragedy. Dotheboys Hall is not meant to show up anything except
Dotheboys Hall. But although Dickens doubtless enjoyed Dr. Blimber quite
as much as Mr. Squeers, it remains true that Dr. Blimber is really a
very good foil to Paul; whereas Squeers is not a foil to Nicholas;
Nicholas is merely a lame excuse for Squeers. The change can be seen
continued in the school, or rather the two schools, to which David
Copperfield goes. The whole idea of David Copperfield&rsquo;s life
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
is that he had the dregs of life before the wine of it. He knew the
worst of the world before he knew the best of it. His childhood at Dr.
Strong&rsquo;s is a second childhood. Now for this purpose the two
schools are perfectly well adapted. Mr. Creakle&rsquo;s school is not
only, like Mr. Squeers&rsquo;s school, a bad school, it is a bad
influence upon David Copperfield. Dr. Strong&rsquo;s school is not only
a good school, it is a good influence upon David Copperfield. I have
taken this case of the schools as a case casual but concrete. The same,
however, can be seen in any of the groups or incidents of the novels on
both sides of the boundary. Mr. Crummles&rsquo;s theatrical company is
only a society that Nicholas happens to fall into. America is only a
place to which Martin Chuzzlewit happens to go. These things are
isolated sketches, and nothing else. Even Todgers&rsquo;s boarding-house
is only a place where Mr. Pecksniff can be delightfully hypocritical. It
is not a place which throws any new light on Mr. Pecksniff&rsquo;s
hypocrisy. But the case is different with that more subtle hypocrite in
<i>Dombey and Son</i>&mdash;I mean Major Bagstock. Dickens does mean it as a
deliberate light on Mr. Dombey&rsquo;s character that he basks with a
fatuous calm in the blazing sun of Major Bagstock&rsquo;s tropical and
offensive flattery. Here, then, is the essence of the change. He not
only wishes to write a novel; this he did as early as <i>Nicholas
Nickleby</i>. He wishes to have as little as possible in the novel that
does not really assist it as a novel. Previously he had asked with the
assistance of what incidents could his hero wander farther and farther
from the pathway. Now he has really begun to ask with the assistance of
what <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
incidents his hero can get nearer and nearer to the goal.</p>

<p>The change made Dickens a greater novelist. I am not sure that it made
him a greater man. One good character by Dickens requires all eternity
to stretch its legs in; and the characters in his later books are always
being tripped up by some tiresome nonsense about the story. For
instance, in <i>Dombey and Son</i>, Mrs. Skewton is really very funny. But
nobody with a love of the real smell of Dickens would compare her for a
moment, for instance, with Mrs. Nickleby. And the reason of Mrs.
Skewton&rsquo;s inferiority is simply this, that she has something to do
in the plot; she has to entrap or assist to entrap Mr. Dombey into
marrying Edith. Mrs. Nickleby, on the other hand, has nothing at all to
do in the story, except to get in everybody&rsquo;s way. The consequence
is that we complain not of her for getting in everyone&rsquo;s way, but
of everyone for getting in hers. What are suns and stars, what are times
and seasons, what is the mere universe, that it should presume to
interrupt Mrs. Nickleby? Mrs. Skewton (though supposed, of course, to be
a much viler sort of woman) has something of the same quality of
splendid and startling irrelevancy. In her also there is the same
feeling of wild threads hung from world to world like the webs of
gigantic spiders; of things connected that seem to have no connection
save by this one adventurous filament of frail and daring folly. Nothing
could be better than Mrs. Skewton when she finds herself, after
convolutions of speech, somehow on the subject of Henry VIII., and
pauses to mention with approval &ldquo;his dear little peepy eyes and
his benevolent chin.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
Nothing could be better than her attempt at Mahomedan resignation when
she feels almost inclined to say &ldquo;that there is no
What&rsquo;s-his-name but Thingummy, and What-you-may-call-it is his
prophet!&rdquo; But she has not so much time as Mrs. Nickleby to say
these good things; also she has not sufficient human virtue to say them
constantly. She is always intent upon her worldly plans, among other
things upon the worldly plan of assisting Charles Dickens to get a story
finished. She is always &ldquo;advancing her shrivelled ear&rdquo; to
listen to what Dombey is saying to Edith. Worldliness is the most solemn
thing in the world; it is far more solemn than other-worldliness. Mrs.
Nickleby can afford to ramble as a child does in a field, or as a child
does to laugh at nothing, for she is like a child, innocent. It is only
the good who can afford to be frivolous.</p>

<p>Broadly speaking, what is said here of Mrs. Skewton applies to the great
part of <i>Dombey and Son</i>, even to the comic part of it. It shows an
advance in art and unity; it does not show an advance in genius and
creation. In some cases, in fact, I cannot help feeling that it shows a
falling off. It may be a personal idiosyncrasy, but there is only one
comic character really prominent in Dickens, upon whom Dickens has
really lavished the wealth of his invention, and who does not amuse me
at all, and that character is Captain Cuttle. But three great exceptions
must be made to any such disparagement of <i>Dombey and Son</i>. They are all
three of that royal order in Dickens&rsquo;s creation which can no more
be described or criticised than strong wine. The first is Major
Bagstock, the second is Cousin Feenix, the third is Toots. In Bagstock
Dickens has blasted <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
for ever that type which pretends to be sincere by the simple operation
of being explosively obvious. He tells about a quarter of the truth, and
then poses as truthful because a quarter of the truth is much simpler
than the whole of it. He is the kind of man who goes about with posers
for Bishops or for Socialists, with plain questions to which he wants a
plain answer. His questions are plain only in the same sense that he
himself is plain&mdash;in the sense of being uncommonly ugly. He is the
man who always bursts with satisfaction because he can call a spade a
spade, as if there were any kind of logical or philosophical use in
merely saying the same word twice over. He is the man who wants things
down in black and white, as if black and white were the only two
colours; as if blue and green and red and gold were not facts of the
universe. He is too selfish to tell the truth and too impatient even to
hear it. He cannot endure the truth, because it is subtle. This man is
almost always like Bagstock&mdash;a sycophant and a toad-eater. A man is
not any the less a toad-eater because he eats his toads with a huge
appetite and gobbles them up, as Bagstock did his breakfast, with the
eyes starting out of his purple face. He flatters brutally. He cringes
with a swagger. And men of the world like Dombey are always taken in by
him, because men of the world are probably the simplest of all the
children of Adam.</p>

<p>Cousin Feenix again is an exquisite suggestion, with his rickety
chivalry and rambling compliments. It was about the period of <i>Dombey
and Son</i> that Dickens began to be taken up by good society. (One can use
only vulgar terms for an essentially vulgar process.)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
And his sketches of the man of good family in the books of this period
show that he had had glimpses of what that singular world is like. The
aristocrats in his earliest books are simply dragons and griffins for
his heroes to fight with&mdash;monsters like Sir Mulberry Hawk or Lord
Verisopht. They are merely created upon the old principle, that your
scoundrel must be polite and powerful&mdash;a very sound principle. The
villain must be not only a villain, but a tyrant. The giant must be
larger than Jack. But in the books of the Dombey period we have many
shrewd glimpses of the queer realities of English aristocracy. Of these
Cousin Feenix is one of the best. Cousin Feenix is a much better sketch
of the essentially decent and chivalrous aristocrat than Sir Leicester
Dedlock. Both of the men are, if you will, fools, as both are honourable
gentlemen. But if one may attempt a classification among fools, Sir
Leicester Dedlock is a stupid fool, while Cousin Feenix is a silly
fool&mdash;which is much better. The difference is that the silly fool
has a folly which is always on the borderland of wit, and even of
wisdom; his wandering wits come often upon undiscovered truths. The
stupid fool is as consistent and as homogeneous as wood; he is as
invincible as the ancestral darkness. Cousin Feenix is a good sketch of
the sort of well-bred old ass who is so fundamentally genuine that he is
always saying very true things by accident. His whole tone also, though
exaggerated like everything in Dickens, is very true to the bewildered
good nature which marks English aristocratic life. The statement that
Dickens could not describe a gentleman is, like most popular
animadversions against<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
Dickens, so very thin and one-sided a truth as to be for serious
purposes a falsehood. When people say that Dickens could not describe a
gentleman, what they mean is this, and so far what they mean is true.
They mean that Dickens could not describe a gentleman as gentlemen feel
a gentleman. They mean that he could not take that atmosphere easily,
accept it as the normal atmosphere, or describe that world from the
inside. This is true. In Dickens&rsquo;s time there was such a thing as
the English people, and Dickens belonged to it. Because there is no such
thing as an English people now, almost all literary men drift towards
what is called Society; almost all literary men either are gentlemen or
pretend to be. Hence, as I say, when we talk of describing a gentleman,
we always mean describing a gentleman from the point of view of one who
either belongs to, or is interested in perpetuating, that type. Dickens
did not describe gentlemen in the way that gentlemen describe gentlemen.
He described them in the way in which he described waiters, or railway
guards, or men drawing with chalk on the pavement. He described them, in
short (and this we may freely concede), from the outside, as he
described any other oddity or special trade. But when it comes to saying
that he did not describe them well, then that is quite another matter,
and that I should emphatically deny. The things that are really odd
about the English upper class he saw with startling promptitude and
penetration, and if the English upper class does not see these odd
things in itself, it is not because they are not there, but because we
are all blind to our own oddities; it is for the same reason that tramps
do not feel dirty, or <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
that niggers do not feel black. I have often heard a dear old English
oligarch say that Dickens could not describe a gentleman, while every
note of his own voice and turn of his own hand recalled Sir Leicester
Dedlock. I have often been told by some old buck that Dickens could not
describe a gentleman, and been told so in the shaky voice and with all
the vague allusiveness of Cousin Feenix.</p>

<p>Cousin Feenix has really many of the main points of the class that
governs England. Take, for an instance, his hazy notion that he is in a
world where everybody knows everybody; whenever he mentions a man, it is
a man &ldquo;with whom my friend Dombey is no doubt acquainted.&rdquo;
That pierces to the very helpless soul of aristocracy. Take again the
stupendous gravity with which he leads up to a joke. That is the very
soul of the House of Commons and the Cabinet, of the high-class English
politics, where a joke is always enjoyed solemnly. Take his insistence
upon the technique of Parliament, his regrets for the time when the
rules of debate were perhaps better observed than they are now. Take
that wonderful mixture in him (which is the real human virtue of our
aristocracy) of a fair amount of personal modesty with an innocent
assumption of rank. Of a man who saw all these genteel foibles so
clearly it is absurd merely to say without further explanation that he
could not describe a gentleman. Let us confine ourselves to saying that
he did not describe a gentleman as gentlemen like to be described.</p>

<p>Lastly, there is the admirable study of Toots, who may be considered as
being in some ways the masterpiece <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
of Dickens. Nowhere else did Dickens express with such astonishing
insight and truth his main contention, which is that to be good and
idiotic is not a poor fate, but, on the contrary, an experience of
primeval innocence, which wonders at all things. Dickens did not know,
anymore than any great man ever knows, what was the particular thing
that he had to preach. He did not know it; he only preached it. But the
particular thing that he had to preach was this: That humility is the
only possible basis of enjoyment; that if one has no other way of being
humble except being poor, then it is better to be poor, and to enjoy;
that if one has no other way of being humble except being imbecile, then
it is better to be imbecile, and to enjoy. That is the deep unconscious
truth in the character of Toots&mdash;that all his externals are flashy
and false; all his internals unconscious, obscure, and true. He wears
loud clothes, and he is silent inside them. His shirts and waistcoats
are covered with bright spots of pink and purple, while his soul is
always covered with the sacred shame. He always gets all the outside
things of life wrong, and all the inside things right. He always admires
the right Christian people, and gives them the wrong Christian names.
Dimly connecting Captain Cuttle with the shop of Mr. Solomon Gills, he
always addresses the astonished mariner as &ldquo;Captain Gills.&rdquo;
He turns Mr. Walter Gay, by a most improving transformation, into
&ldquo;Lieutenant Walters.&rdquo; But he always knows which people upon
his own principles to admire. He forgets who they are, but he remembers
what they are. With the clear eyes of humility he perceives the whole
world as it is.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
He respects the Game Chicken for being strong, as even the Game Chicken
ought to be respected for being strong. He respects Florence for being
good, as even Florence ought to be respected for being good. And he has
no doubt about which he admires most; he prefers goodness to strength,
as do all masculine men. It is through the eyes of such characters as
Toots that Dickens really sees the whole of his tales. For even if one
calls him a half-wit, it still makes a difference that he keeps the
right half of his wits. When we think of the unclean and craven spirit
in which Toots might be treated in a psychological novel of to-day; how
he might walk with a mooncalf face, and a brain of bestial darkness, the
soul rises in real homage to Dickens for showing how much simple
gratitude and happiness can remain in the lopped roots of the most
simplified intelligence. If scientists must treat a man as a dog, it
need not be always as a mad dog. They might grant him, like Toots, a
little of the dog&rsquo;s loyalty and the dog&rsquo;s reward.</p>

<h2><a name="COPPERFIELD" id="COPPERFIELD"></a>DAVID COPPERFIELD</h2>

<p>In this book Dickens is really trying to write a new kind of book, and
the enterprise is almost as chivalrous as a cavalry charge. He is making
a romantic attempt to be realistic. That is almost the definition of
<i>David Copperfield</i>. In his last book, <i>Dombey and Son</i>, we see a
certain maturity and even a certain mild exhaustion in his earlier
farcical method. He never failed to have fine things in any of his
books, and Toots is a very fine thing. Still, I could never find Captain
Cuttle and Mr. Sol Gills very funny, and the whole Wooden Midshipman
seems to me very wooden. In <i>David Copperfield</i> he suddenly unseals a
new torrent of truth, the truth out of his own life. The impulse of the
thing is autobiography; he is trying to tell all the absurd things that
have happened to himself, and not the least absurd thing is himself. Yet
though it is Dickens&rsquo;s ablest and clearest book, there is in it a
falling away of a somewhat singular kind.</p>

<p>Generally speaking there was astonishingly little of fatigue in
Dickens&rsquo;s books. He sometimes wrote bad work; he sometimes wrote
even unimportant work; but he wrote hardly a line which is not full of
his own fierce vitality and fancy. If he is dull it is hardly ever
because he cannot think of anything; it is because, by some silly
excitement or momentary lapse of judgment, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
he has thought of something that was not worth thinking of. If his joke
is feeble, it is as an impromptu joke at an uproarious dinner-table may
be feeble; it is no indication of any lack of vitality. The joke is
feeble, but it is not a sign of feebleness. Broadly speaking, this is
true of Dickens. If his writing is not amusing us, at least it is
amusing him. Even when he is tiring he is not tired.</p>

<p>But in the case of <i>David Copperfield</i> there is a real reason for noting
an air of fatigue. For although this is the best of all Dickens&rsquo;s
books, it constantly disappoints the critical and intelligent reader.
The reason is that Dickens began it under his sudden emotional impulse
of telling the whole truth about himself and gradually allowed the whole
truth to be more and more diluted, until towards the end of the book we
are back in the old pedantic and decorative art of Dickens, an art which
we justly admired in its own place and on its own terms, but which we
resent when we feel it gradually returning through a tale pitched
originally in a more practical and piercing key. Here, I say, is the one
real example of the fatigue of Dickens. He begins his story in a new
style and then slips back into an old one. The earlier part is in his
later manner. The later part is in his earlier manner.</p>

<p>There are many marks of something weak and shadowy in the end of <i>David
Copperfield</i>. Here, for instance, is one of them which is not without
its bearing on many tendencies of modern England. Why did Dickens at the
end of this book give way to that typically English optimism about
emigration? He seems to think that he can cure the souls of a whole
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
cartload, or rather boatload, of his characters by sending them all
to the Colonies. Peggotty is a desolate and insulted parent whose house
has been desecrated and his pride laid low; therefore let him go to
Australia. Emily is a woman whose heart is broken and whose honour is
blasted; but she will be quite happy if she goes to Australia. Mr.
Micawber is a man whose soul cannot be made to understand the tyranny of
time or the limits of human hope; but he will understand all these
things if he goes to Australia. For it must be noted that Dickens does
not use this emigration merely as a mode of exit. He does not send these
characters away on a ship merely as a symbol suggesting that they pass
wholly out of his hearer&rsquo;s life. He does definitely suggest that
Australia is a sort of island Valley of Avalon, where the soul may heal
it of its grievous wound. It is seriously suggested that Peggotty finds
peace in Australia. It is really indicated that Emily regains her
dignity in Australia. It is positively explained of Mr. Micawber not
that he was happy in Australia (for he would be that anywhere), but that
he was definitely prosperous and practically successful in Australia;
and that he would certainly be nowhere. Colonising is not talked of
merely as a coarse, economic expedient for going to a new market. It is
really offered as something that will cure the hopeless tragedy of
Peggotty; as something that will cure the still more hopeless comedy of
Micawber.</p>

<p>I will not dwell here on the subsequent adventures of this very
sentimental and extremely English illusion. It would be an exaggeration
to say that Dickens in this matter is something of a forerunner of much
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
modern imperialism. His political views were such that he would have
regarded modern imperialism with horror and contempt. Nevertheless there
is here something of that hazy sentimentalism which makes some
Imperialists prefer to talk of the fringe of the empire of which they
know nothing, rather than of the heart of the empire which they know is
diseased. It is said that in the twilight and decline of Rome, close to
the dark ages, the people in Gaul believed that Britain was a land of
ghosts (perhaps it was foggy), and that the dead were ferried across to
it from the northern coast of France. If (as is not entirely impossible)
our own century appears to future ages as a time of temporary decay and
twilight, it may be said that there was attached to England a blessed
island called Australia to which the souls of the socially dead were
ferried across to remain in bliss for ever.</p>

<p>This element which is represented by the colonial optimism at the end of
<i>David Copperfield</i> is a moral element. The truth is that there is
something a little mean about this sort of optimism. I do not like the
notion of David Copperfield sitting down comfortably to his tea-table
with Agnes, having got rid of all the inconvenient or distressing
characters of the story by sending them to the other side of the world.
The whole thing has too much about it of the selfishness of a family
which sends a scapegrace to the Colonies to starve with its blessing.
There is too much in the whole thing of that element which was satirised
by an ironic interpretation of the epitaph &ldquo;Peace, perfect peace,
with loved ones far away.&rdquo; We should have thought more of David
Copperfield (and also of Charles<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
Dickens) if he had endeavoured for the rest of his life, by
conversation and comfort, to bind up the wounds of his old friends from
the seaside. We should have thought more of David Copperfield (and also
of Charles Dickens) if he had faced the possibility of going on till his
dying day lending money to Mr. Wilkins Micawber. We should have thought
more of David Copperfield (and also of Charles Dickens) if he had not
looked upon the marriage with Dora merely as a flirtation, an episode
which he survived and ought to survive. And yet the truth is that there
is nowhere in fiction where we feel so keenly the primary human instinct
and principle that a marriage is a marriage and irrevocable, that such
things do leave a wound and also a bond as in this case of David&rsquo;s
short connection with his silly little wife. When all is said and done,
when Dickens has done his best and his worst, when he has
sentimentalised for pages and tried to tie up everything in the pink
tape of optimism, the fact, in the psychology of the reader, still
remains. The reader does still feel that David&rsquo;s marriage to Dora
was a real marriage; and that his marriage to Agnes was nothing, a
middle-aged compromise, a taking of the second best, a sort of
spiritualised and sublimated marriage of convenience. For all the
readers of Dickens Dora is thoroughly avenged. The modern world (intent
on anarchy in everything, even in Government) refuses to perceive the
permanent element of tragic constancy which inheres in all passion, and
which is the origin of marriage. Marriage rests upon the fact that you
cannot have your cake and eat it; that you cannot lose your heart and
have it. But, as I have said, there is perhaps no place
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
in literature where we feel more vividly the sense of this monogamous
instinct in man than in David Copperfield. A man is monogamous even if
he is only monogamous for a month; love is eternal even if it is only
eternal for a month. It always leaves behind it the sense of something
broken and betrayed.</p>

<p>But I have mentioned Dora in this connection only because she
illustrates the same fact which Micawber illustrates; the fact that
there is at the end of this book too much tendency to bless people and
get rid of them. Micawber is a nuisance. Dickens the despot condemns him
to exile. Dora is a nuisance. Dickens the despot condemns her to death.
But it is the whole business of Dickens in the world to express the fact
that such people are the spice and interest of life. It is the whole
point of Dickens that there is nobody more worth living with than a
strong, splendid, entertaining, immortal nuisance. Micawber interrupts
practical life; but what is practical life that it should venture to
interrupt Micawber? Dora confuses the housekeeping; but we are not angry
with Dora because she confuses the housekeeping. We are angry with the
housekeeping because it confuses Dora. I repeat, and it cannot be too
much repeated that the whole lesson of Dickens is here. It is better to
know Micawber than not to know the minor worries that arise out of
knowing Micawber. It is better to have a bad debt and a good friend. In
the same way it is better to marry a human and healthy personality which
happens to attract you than to marry a mere housewife; for a mere
housewife is a mere housekeeper. All this was what Dickens stood for;
that the very people who are most <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
irritating in small business circumstances are often the people who are
most delightful in long stretches of experience of life. It is just the
man who is maddening when he is ordering a cutlet or arranging an
appointment who is probably the man in whose company it is worth while
to journey steadily towards the grave. Distribute the dignified people
and the capable people and the highly business-like people among all the
situations which their ambition or their innate corruption may demand;
but keep close to your heart, keep deep in your inner councils the
absurd people. Let the clever people pretend to govern you, let the
unimpeachable people pretend to advise you, but let the fools alone
influence you; let the laughable people whose faults you see and
understand be the only people who are really inside your life, who
really come near you or accompany you on your lonely march towards the
last impossibility. That is the whole meaning of Dickens; that we should
keep the absurd people for our friends. And here at the end of <i>David
Copperfield</i> he seems in some dim way to deny it. He seems to want to
get rid of the preposterous people simply because they will always
continue to be preposterous. I have a horrible feeling that David
Copperfield will send even his aunt to Australia if she worries him too
much about donkeys.</p>

<p>I repeat, then, that this wrong ending of <i>David Copperfield</i> is one of
the very few examples in Dickens of a real symptom of fatigue. Having
created splendid beings for whom alone life might be worth living, he
cannot endure the thought of his hero living with them. Having given his
hero superb and terrible <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
friends, he is afraid of the awful and tempestuous vista of their
friendship. He slips back into a more superficial kind of story and ends
it in a more superficial way. He is afraid of the things he has made; of
that terrible figure Micawber; of that yet more terrible figure Dora. He
cannot make up his mind to see his hero perpetually entangled in the
splendid tortures and sacred surprises that come from living with really
individual and unmanageable people. He cannot endure the idea that his
fairy prince will not have henceforward a perfectly peaceful time. But
the wise old fairy tales (which are the wisest things in the world, at
any rate the wisest things of worldly origin), the wise old fairy tales
never were so silly as to say that the prince and the princess lived
peacefully ever afterwards. The fairy tales said that the prince and
princess lived happily ever afterwards: and so they did. They lived
happily, although it is very likely that from time to time they threw
the furniture at each other. Most marriages, I think, are happy
marriages; but there is no such thing as a contented marriage. The whole
pleasure of marriage is that it is a perpetual crisis. David Copperfield
and Dora quarrelled over the cold mutton; and if they had gone on
quarrelling to the end of their lives, they would have gone on loving
each other to the end of their lives; it would have been a human
marriage. But David Copperfield and Agnes would agree about the cold
mutton. And that cold mutton would be very cold.</p>

<p>I have here endeavoured to suggest some of the main merits of Dickens
within the framework of one of his faults. I have said that <i>David
Copperfield</i> represents a rather sad transition from his strongest
method to his <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
weakest. Nobody would ever complain of Charles Dickens going on writing
his own kind of novels, his old kind of novels. If there be anywhere a
man who loves good books, that man wishes that there were four <i>Oliver
Twists</i> and at least forty-four <i>Pickwicks</i>. If there be any one who
loves laughter and creation, he would be glad to read a hundred of
<i>Nicholas Nickleby</i> and two hundred of <i>The Old Curiosity Shop</i>. But
while any one would have welcomed one of Dickens&rsquo;s own ordered and
conventional novels, it was not in this spirit that they welcomed <i>David
Copperfield</i>.</p>

<p><i>David Copperfield</i> begins as if it were going to be a new kind of
Dickens novel; then it gradually turns into an old kind of Dickens
novel. It is here that many readers of this splendid book have been
subtly and secretly irritated. Nicholas Nickleby is all very well; we
accept him as something which is required to tie the whole affair
together. Nicholas is a sort of string or clothes-line on which are hung
the limp figure of Smike, the jumping-jack of Mr. Squeers and the twin
dolls named Cheeryble. If we do not accept Nicholas Nickleby as the hero
of the story, at least we accept him as the title of the story. But in
<i>David Copperfield</i> Dickens begins something which looks for the moment
fresh and startling. In the earlier chapters (the amazing earlier
chapters of this book) he does seem to be going to tell the living truth
about a living boy and man. It is melancholy to see that sudden fire
fading. It is sad to see David Copperfield gradually turning into
Nicholas Nickleby. Nicholas Nickleby does not exist at all; he is a
quite colourless primary condition of the story. We look through
Nicholas Nickleby at the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
story just as we look through a plain pane of glass at the street. But
David Copperfield does begin by existing; it is only gradually that he
gives up that exhausting habit.</p>

<p>Any fair critical account of Dickens must always make him out much
smaller than he is. For any fair criticism of Dickens must take account
of his evident errors, as I have taken account of one of the most
evident of them during the last two or three pages. It would not even be
loyal to conceal them. But no honest criticism, no criticism, though it
spoke with the tongues of men and angels, could ever really talk about
Dickens. In all this that I have said I have not been talking about
Dickens at all. I say it with equanimity; I say it even with arrogance.
I have been talking about the gaps of Dickens. I have been talking about
the omissions of Dickens. I have been talking about the slumber of
Dickens and the forgetfulness and unconsciousness of Dickens. In one
word, I have been talking not about Dickens, but about the absence of
Dickens. But when we come to him and his work itself, what is there to
be said? What is there to be said about earthquake and the dawn? He has
created, especially in this book of <i>David Copperfield</i>, he has created,
creatures who cling to us and tyrannise over us, creatures whom we would
not forget if we could, creatures whom we could not forget if we would,
creatures who are more actual than the man who made them.</p>

<p>This is the excuse for all that indeterminate and rambling and sometimes
sentimental criticism of which Dickens, more than any one else, is the
victim, of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
which I fear that I for one have made him the victim in this place.
When I was a boy I could not understand why the Dickensians worried so
wearily about Dickens, about where he went to school and where he ate
his dinners, about how he wore his trousers and when he cut his hair. I
used to wonder why they did not write something that I could read about
a man like Micawber. But I have come to the conclusion that this almost
hysterical worship of the man, combined with a comparatively feeble
criticism on his works, is just and natural. Dickens was a man like
ourselves; we can see where he went wrong, and study him without being
stunned or getting the sunstroke. But Micawber is not a man; Micawber is
the superman. We can only walk round and round him wondering what we
shall say. All the critics of Dickens, when all is said and done, have
only walked round and round Micawber wondering what they should say. I
am myself at this moment walking round and round Micawber wondering what
I shall say. And I have not found out yet.</p>

<h2><a name="CHRISTMAS_STORIES" id="CHRISTMAS_STORIES"></a>CHRISTMAS STORIES</h2>

<p>The power of Dickens is shown even in the scraps of Dickens, just as the
virtue of a saint is said to be shown in fragments of his property or
rags from his robe. It is with such fragments that we are chiefly
concerned in the <i>Christmas Stories</i>. Many of them are fragments in the
literal sense; Dickens began them and then allowed some one else to
carry them on; they are almost rejected notes. In all the other cases we
have been considering the books that he wrote; here we have rather to
consider the books that he might have written. And here we find the
final evidence and the unconscious stamp of greatness, as we might find
it in some broken bust or some rejected moulding in the studio of
Michael Angelo.</p>

<p>These sketches or parts of sketches all belong to that period in his
later life when he had undertaken the duties of an editor, the very
heavy duties of a very popular editor. He was not by any means naturally
fitted for that position. He was the best man in the world for founding
papers; but many people wished that he could have been buried under the
foundations, like the first builder in some pagan and prehistoric pile.
He called the <i>Daily News</i> into existence, but when once it existed, it
objected to him strongly. It is not easy, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
and perhaps it is not important, to state truly the cause of this
incapacity. It was not in the least what is called the ordinary fault or
weakness of the artist. It was not that he was careless; rather it was
that he was too conscientious. It was not that he had the
irresponsibility of genius; rather it was that he had the irritating
responsibility of genius; he wanted everybody to see things as he saw
them. But in spite of all this he certainly ran two great popular
periodicals&mdash;<i>Household Words</i> and <i>All the Year Round</i>&mdash;with
enormous popular success. And he certainly so far succeeded in throwing
himself into the communism of journalism, into the nameless brotherhood
of a big paper, that many earnest Dickensians are still engaged in
picking out pieces of Dickens from the anonymous pages of <i>Household
Words</i> and <i>All the Year Round</i>, and those parts which have been already
beyond question picked out and proved are often fragmentary. The genuine
writing of Dickens breaks off at a certain point, and the writing of
some one else begins. But when the writing of Dickens breaks off, I
fancy that we know it.</p>

<p>The singular thing is that some of the best work that Dickens ever did,
better than the work in his best novels, can be found in these slight
and composite scraps of journalism. For instance, the solemn and
self-satisfied account of the duty and dignity of a waiter given in the
opening chapter of <i>Somebody&rsquo;s Luggage</i> is quite as full and fine
as anything done anywhere by its author in the same vein of sumptuous
satire. It is as good as the account which Mr. Bumble gives of out-door
relief, which, &ldquo;properly understood, is the parochial safeguard.
The great thing is to give <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
the paupers what they don&rsquo;t want, and then they never come
again.&rdquo; It is as good as Mr. Podsnap&rsquo;s description of the
British Constitution, which was bestowed on him by Providence. None of
these celebrated passages is more obviously Dickens at his best than
this, the admirable description of &ldquo;the true principles of
waitering,&rdquo; or the account of how the waiter&rsquo;s father came
back to his mother in broad daylight, &ldquo;in itself an act of madness
on the part of a waiter,&rdquo; and how he expired repeating continually
&ldquo;two and six is three and four is nine.&rdquo; That waiter&rsquo;s
explanatory soliloquy might easily have opened an excellent novel, as
<i>Martin Chuzzlewit</i> is opened by the clever nonsense about the genealogy
of the Chuzzlewits, or as <i>Bleak House</i> is opened by a satiric account
of the damp, dim life of a law court. Yet Dickens practically abandoned
the scheme of <i>Somebody&rsquo;s Luggage</i>; he only wrote two sketches out
of those obviously intended. He may almost be said to have only written
a brilliant introduction to another man&rsquo;s book.</p>

<p>Yet it is exactly in such broken outbreaks that his greatness appears.
If a man has flung away bad ideas he has shown his sense, but if he has
flung away good ideas he has shown his genius. He has proved that he
actually has that over-pressure of pure creativeness which we see in
nature itself, &ldquo;that of a hundred seeds, she often brings but one
to bear.&rdquo; Dickens had to be Malthusian about his spiritual
children. Critics have called Keats and others who died young &ldquo;the
great Might-have-beens of literary history.&rdquo; Dickens certainly was
not merely a great Might-have-been. Dickens, to say the least of him,
was a great Was.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
Yet this fails fully to express the richness of his talent; for the
truth is that he was a great Was and also a great Might-have-been. He
said what he had to say, and yet not all he had to say. Wild pictures,
possible stories, tantalising and attractive trains of thought,
perspectives of adventure, crowded so continually upon his mind that at
the end there was a vast mass of them left over, ideas that he literally
had not the opportunity to develop, tales that he literally had not the
time to tell. This is shown clearly in his private notes and letters,
which are full of schemes singularly striking and suggestive, schemes
which he never carried out. It is indicated even more clearly by these
<i>Christmas Stories</i>, collected out of the chaotic opulence of <i>Household
Words</i> and <i>All the Year Round</i>. He wrote short stories actually because
he had not time to write long stories. He often put into the short story
a deep and branching idea which would have done very well for a long
story; many of his long stories, so to speak, broke off short. This is
where he differs from most who are called the Might-have-beens of
literature. Marlowe and Chatterton failed because of their weakness.
Dickens failed because of his force.</p>

<p>Examine for example this case of the waiter in <i>Somebody&rsquo;s
Luggage</i>. Dickens obviously knew enough about that waiter to have made
him a running spring of joy throughout a whole novel; as the beadle is
in <i>Oliver Twist</i>, or the undertaker in <i>Martin Chuzzlewit</i>. Every touch
of him tingles with truth, from the vague gallantry with which he asks,
&ldquo;Would&rsquo;st thou know, fair reader (if of the adorable female
sex)&rdquo; to the official severity with which he takes the chambermaid
down,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
&ldquo;as many pegs as is desirable for the future comfort of all
parties.&rdquo; If Dickens had developed this character at full length
in a book he would have preserved for ever in literature a type of great
humour and great value, and a type which may only too soon be
disappearing from English history. He would have eternalised the English
waiter. He still exists in some sound old taverns and decent country
inns, but there is no one left really capable of singing his praises. I
know that Mr. Bernard Shaw has done something of the sort in the
delightfully whimsical account of William in <i>You Never Can Tell</i>. But
nothing will persuade me that Mr. Bernard Shaw can really understand the
English waiter. He can never have ordered wine from him for instance.
And though the English waiter is by the nature of things solemn about
everything, he can never reach the true height and ecstasy of his
solemnity except about wine. What the real English waiter would do or
say if Mr. Shaw asked him for a vegetarian meal I cannot dare to
predict. I rather think that for the first time in his life he would
laugh&mdash;a horrible sight.</p>

<p>Dickens&rsquo;s waiter is described by one who is not merely witty,
truthful, and observant, like Mr. Bernard Shaw, but one who really knew
the atmosphere of inns, one who knew and even liked the smell of beef,
and beer, and brandy. Hence there is a richness in Dickens&rsquo;s
portrait which does not exist in Mr. Shaw&rsquo;s. Mr. Shaw&rsquo;s
waiter is merely a man of tact; Dickens&rsquo;s is a man of principle.
Mr. Shaw&rsquo;s waiter is an opportunist, just as Mr. Shaw is an
opportunist in politics. Dickens&rsquo;s waiter is ready to stand up
seriously for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
&ldquo;the true principles of waitering,&rdquo; just as Dickens was
ready to stand up for the true principles of Liberalism. Mr.
Shaw&rsquo;s waiter is agnostic; his motto is &ldquo;You never can
tell.&rdquo; Dickens&rsquo;s waiter is a dogmatist; his motto is
&ldquo;You can tell; I will tell you.&rdquo; And the true old-fashioned
English waiter had really this grave and even moral attitude; he was the
servant of the customers as a priest is the servant of the faithful, but
scarcely in any less dignified sense. Surely it is not mere patriotic
partiality that makes one lament the disappearance of this careful and
honourable figure crowded out by meaner men at meaner wages, by the
German waiter who has learnt five languages in the course of running
away from his own, or the Italian waiter who regards those he serves
with a darkling contempt which must certainly be that either of a
dynamiter or an exiled prince. The human and hospitable English waiter
is vanishing. And Dickens might perhaps have saved him, as he saved
Christmas.</p>

<p>I have taken this case of the waiter in Dickens and his equally
important counterpart in England as an example of the sincere and genial
sketches scattered about these short stories. But there are many others,
and one at least demands special mention; I mean Mrs. Lirriper, the
London landlady. Not only did Dickens never do anything better in a
literary sense, but he never performed more perfectly his main moral
function, that of insisting through laughter and flippancy upon the
virtue of Christian charity. There has been much broad farce against the
lodging-house keeper: he alone could have written broad farce in her
favour. It is fashionable to represent the landlady as a tyrant;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
it is too much forgotten that if she is one of the oppressors she is at
least as much one of the oppressed. If she is bad-tempered it is often
for the same reasons that make all women bad-tempered (I suppose the
exasperating qualities of the other sex); if she is grasping it is often
because when a husband makes generosity a vice it is often necessary
that a wife should make avarice a virtue. All this Dickens suggested
very soundly and in a few strokes in the more remote character of Miss
Wozenham. But in Mrs. Lirriper he went further and did not fare worse.
In Mrs. Lirriper he suggested quite truly how huge a mass of real good
humour, of grand unconscious patience, of unfailing courtesy and
constant and difficult benevolence is concealed behind many a
lodging-house door and compact in the red-faced person of many a
preposterous landlady. Any one could easily excuse the ill-humour of the
poor. But great masses of the poor have not even any ill-humour to be
excused. Their cheeriness is startling enough to be the foundation of a
miracle play; and certainly is startling enough to be the foundation of
a romance. Yet I do not know of any romance in which it is expressed
except this one.</p>

<p>Of the landlady as of the waiter it may be said that Dickens left in a
slight sketch what he might have developed through a long and strong
novel. For Dickens had hold of one great truth, the neglect of which
has, as it were, truncated and made meagre the work of many brilliant
modern novelists. Modern novelists try to make long novels out of subtle
characters. But a subtle character soon comes to an end, because it
works in and in to its own centre and dies there. But a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
simple character goes on for ever in a fresh interest and energy,
because it works out and out into the infinite universe. Mr. George
Moore in France is not by any means so interesting as Mrs. Lirriper in
France; for she is trying to find France and he is only trying to find
George Moore. Mrs. Lirriper is the female equivalent of Mr. Pickwick.
Unlike Mrs. Bardell (another and lesser landlady) she was fully worthy
to be Mrs. Pickwick. For in both cases the essential truth is the same;
that original innocence which alone deserves adventures and because it
alone can appreciate them. We have had Mr. Pickwick in England and we
can imagine him in France. We have had Mrs. Lirriper in France and we
can imagine her in Mesopotamia or in heaven. The subtle character in the
modern novels we cannot really imagine anywhere except in the suburbs or
in Limbo.</p>

<hr /><p class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></p>
<h2><a name="BLEAK" id="BLEAK"></a>BLEAK HOUSE</h2>

<p><i>Bleak House</i> is not certainly Dickens&rsquo;s best book; but perhaps it
is his best novel. Such a distinction is not a mere verbal trick; it has
to be remembered rather constantly in connection with his work. This
particular story represents the highest point of his intellectual
maturity. Maturity does not necessarily mean perfection. It is idle to
say that a mature potato is perfect; some people like new potatoes. A
mature potato is not perfect, but it is a mature potato; the mind of an
intelligent epicure may find it less adapted to his particular purpose;
but the mind of an intelligent potato would at once admit it as being,
beyond all doubt, a genuine, fully developed specimen of his own
particular species. The same is in some degree true even of literature.
We can say more or less when a human being has come to his full mental
growth, even if we go so far as to wish that he had never come to it.
Children are very much nicer than grown-up people; but there is such a
thing as growing up. When Dickens wrote <i>Bleak House</i> he had grown up.</p>

<p>Like Napoleon, he had made his army on the march. He had walked in front
of his mob of aggressive characters as Napoleon did in front of the
half-baked battalions of the Revolution. And, like Napoleon, he won
battle after battle before he knew his own plan <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
of campaign; like Napoleon, he put the enemies&rsquo; forces to rout
before he had put his own force into order. Like Napoleon, he had a
victorious army almost before he had an army. After his decisive
victories Napoleon began to put his house in order; after his decisive
victories Dickens also began to put his house in order. The house, when
he had put it in order, was <i>Bleak House</i>.</p>

<p>There was one thing common to nearly all the other Dickens tales, with
the possible exception of <i>Dombey and Son</i>. They were all rambling
tales; and they all had a perfect right to be. They were all rambling
tales for the very simple reason that they were all about rambling
people. They were novels of adventure; they were even diaries of travel.
Since the hero strayed from place to place, it did not seem unreasonable
that the story should stray from subject to subject. This is true of the
bulk of the novels up to and including <i>David Copperfield</i>, up to the
very brink or threshold of <i>Bleak House</i>. Mr. Pickwick wanders about on
the white English roads, always looking for antiquities and always
finding novelties. Poor Oliver Twist wanders along the same white roads
to seek his fortune and to find his misfortune. Nicholas Nickleby goes
walking across England because he is young and hopeful; Little
Nell&rsquo;s grandfather does the same thing because he is old and
silly. There is not much in common between Samuel Pickwick and Oliver
Twist; there is not much in common between Oliver Twist and Nicholas
Nickleby; there is not much in common (let us hope) between Little
Nell&rsquo;s grandfather and any other human being. But they all have
this in common, that they may actually all have trodden in each
other&rsquo;s footprints.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
They were all wanderers on the face of the same fair English land.
<i>Martin Chuzzlewit</i> was only made popular by the travels of the hero in
America. When we come to <i>Dombey and Son</i> we find, as I have said, an
exception; but even here it is odd to note the fact that it was an
exception almost by accident. In Dickens&rsquo;s original scheme of the
story, much greater prominence was to have been given to the travels and
trials of Walter Gay; in fact, the young man was to have had a
deterioration of character which could only have been adequately
detailed in him in his character of a vagabond and a wastrel. The most
important point, however, is that when we come to <i>David Copperfield</i>,
in some sense the summit of his serious literature, we find the thing
still there. The hero still wanders from place to place, his genius is
still gipsy. The adventures in the book are less violent and less
improbable than those which wait for Pickwick and Nicholas Nickleby; but
they are still adventures and not merely events; they are still things
met on a road. The facts of the story fall away from David as such facts
do fall away from a traveller walking fast. We are more likely perhaps,
to pass by Mr. Creakle&rsquo;s school than to pass by Mrs.
Jarley&rsquo;s wax-works. The only point is that we should pass by both
of them. Up to this point in Dickens&rsquo;s development, his novel,
however true, is still picaresque; his hero never really rests anywhere
in the story. No one seems really to know where Mr. Pickwick lived. Here
he has no abiding city.</p>

<p>When we come to <i>Bleak House</i>, we come to a change in artistic
structure. The thing is no longer a string of incidents; it is a cycle
of incidents. It returns upon <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
itself; it has recurrent melody and poetic justice; it has artistic
constancy and artistic revenge. It preserves the unities; even to some
extent it preserves the unities of time and place. The story circles
round two or three symbolic places; it does not go straggling
irregularly all over England like one of Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s coaches.
People go from one place to another place; but not from one place to
another place on the road to everywhere else. Mr. Jarndyce goes from
Bleak House to visit Mr. Boythorn; but he comes back to Bleak House.
Miss Clare and Miss Summerson go from Bleak House to visit Mr. and Mrs.
Bayham Badger; but they come back to Bleak House. The whole story strays
from Bleak House and plunges into the foul fogs of Chancery and the
autumn mists of Chesney Wold; but the whole story comes back to Bleak
House. The domestic title is appropriate; it is a permanent address.</p>

<p>Dickens&rsquo;s openings are almost always good; but the opening of
<i>Bleak House</i> is good in a quite new and striking sense. Nothing could
be better, for instance, than the first foolish chapter about the
genealogy of the Chuzzlewits; but it has nothing to do with the
Chuzzlewits. Nothing could be better than the first chapter of <i>David
Copperfield</i>; the breezy entrance and banging exit of Miss Betsy
Trotwood. But if there is ultimately any crisis or serious
subject-matter of <i>David Copperfield</i>, it is the marred marriage with
Dora, the final return to Agnes; and all this is in no way involved in
the highly-amusing fact that his aunt expected him to be a girl. We may
repeat that the matter is picaresque. The story begins in one place and
ends in another place, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
and there is no real connection between the beginning and the end
except a biographical connection.</p>

<p>A picaresque novel is only a very eventful biography; but the opening of
<i>Bleak House</i> is quite another business altogether. It is admirable in
quite another way. The description of the fog in the first chapter of
<i>Bleak House</i> is good in itself; but it is not merely good in itself,
like the description of the wind in the opening of <i>Martin Chuzzlewit</i>;
it is also good in the sense that Maeterlinck is good; it is what the
modern people call an atmosphere. Dickens begins in the Chancery fog
because he means to end in the Chancery fog. He did not begin in the
Chuzzlewit wind because he meant to end in it; he began in it because it
was a good beginning. This is perhaps the best short way of stating the
peculiarity of the position of <i>Bleak House</i>. In this <i>Bleak House</i>
beginning we have the feeling that it is not only a beginning; we have
the feeling that the author sees the conclusion and the whole. The
beginning is alpha and omega: the beginning and the end. He means that
all the characters and all the events shall be read through the smoky
colours of that sinister and unnatural vapour.</p>

<p>The same is true throughout the whole tale; the whole tale is symbolic
and crowded with symbols. Miss Flite is a funny character, like Miss La
Creevy, but Miss La Creevy means only Miss La Creevy. Miss Flite means
Chancery. The rag-and-bone man, Krook, is a powerful grotesque; so is
Quilp; but in the story Quilp only means Quilp; Krook means Chancery.
Rick Carstone is a kind and tragic figure, like Sidney Carton; but
Sidney Carton only means the tragedy of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
human nature; Rick Carstone means the tragedy of Chancery. Little Jo
dies pathetically like Little Paul; but for the death of Little Paul we
can only blame Dickens; for the death of Little Jo we blame Chancery.
Thus the artistic unity of the book, compared to all the author&rsquo;s
earlier novels, is satisfying, almost suffocating. There is the <i>motif</i>,
and again the <i>motif</i>. Almost everything is calculated to assert and
re-assert the savage morality of Dickens&rsquo;s protest against a
particular social evil. The whole theme is that which another Englishman
as jovial as Dickens defined shortly and finally as the law&rsquo;s
delay. The fog of the first chapter never lifts.</p>

<p>In this twilight he traced wonderful shapes. Those people who fancy that
Dickens was a mere clown; that he could not describe anything delicate
or deadly in the human character,&mdash;those who fancy this are mostly
people whose position is explicable in many easy ways. The vast majority
of the fastidious critics have, in the quite strict and solid sense of
the words, never read Dickens at all; hence their opposition is due to
and inspired by a hearty innocence which will certainly make them
enthusiastic Dickensians if they ever, by some accident, happen to read
him. In other cases it is due to a certain habit of reading books under
the eye of a conventional critic, admiring what we expect to admire,
regretting what we are told to regret, waiting for Mr. Bumble to admire
him, waiting for Little Nell to despise her. Yet again, of course, it is
sometimes due to that basest of all artistic indulgences (certainly far
baser than the pleasure of absinthe or the pleasure of opium), the
pleasure of appreciating <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
works of art which ordinary men cannot appreciate. Surely the vilest
point of human vanity is exactly that; to ask to be admired for admiring
what your admirers do not admire. But whatever be the reason, whether
rude or subtle, which has prevented any particular man from personally
admiring Dickens, there is in connection with a book like <i>Bleak House</i>
something that may be called a solid and impressive challenge. Let
anyone who thinks that Dickens could not describe the semi-tones and the
abrupt instincts of real human nature simply take the trouble to read
the stretch of chapters which detail the way in which Carstone&rsquo;s
mind grew gradually morbid about his chances in Chancery. Let him note
the manner in which the mere masculinity of Carstone is caught; how as
he grows more mad he grows more logical, nay, more rational. Good women
who love him come to him, and point out the fact that Jarndyce is a good
man, a fact to them solid like an object of the senses. In answer he
asks them to understand his position. He does not say this; he does not
say that. He only urges that Jarndyce may have become cynical in the
affair in the same sense that he himself may have become cynical in the
affair. He is always a man; that is to say, he is always unanswerable,
always wrong. The passionate certainty of the woman beats itself like
battering waves against the thin smooth wall of his insane consistency.
I repeat: let any one who thinks that Dickens was a gross and indelicate
artist read that part of the book. If Dickens had been the clumsy
journalist that such people represent, he never could have written such
an episode at all. A clumsy journalist would have made
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
Rick Carstone in his mad career cast off Esther and Ada and the others.
The great artist knew better. He knew that even if all the good in a man
is dying, the last sense that dies is the sense that knows a good woman
from a bad; it is like the scent of a noble hound.</p>

<p>The clumsy journalist would have made Rick Carstone turn on John
Jarndyce with an explosion of hatred, as of one who had made an
exposure&mdash;who had found out what low people call &ldquo;a false
friend&rdquo; in what they call &ldquo;his true colours.&rdquo; The
great artist knew better; he knew that a good man going wrong tries to
salve his soul to the last with the sense of generosity and intellectual
justice. He will try to love his enemy if only out of mere love of
himself. As the wolf dies fighting, the good man gone wrong dies
arguing. This is what constitutes the true and real tragedy of Richard
Carstone. It is strictly the one and only great tragedy that Dickens
wrote. It is like the tragedy of Hamlet. The others are not tragedies
because they deal almost with dead men. The tragedy of old Dorrit is
merely the sad spectacle of a dotard dragged about Europe in his last
childhood. The tragedy of Steerforth is only that of one who dies
suddenly; the tragedy of old Dombey only that of one who was dead all
the time. But Rick is a real tragedy, for he is still alive when the
quicksand sucks him down.</p>

<p>It is impossible to avoid putting in the first place this pall of smoke
which Dickens has deliberately spread over the story. It is quite true
that the country underneath is clear enough to contain any number of
unconscious comedians or of merry monsters such as <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
he was in the custom of introducing into the carnival of his tales. But
he meant us to take the smoky atmosphere seriously. Charles Dickens, who
was, like all men who are really funny about funny things, horribly
serious about serious things, certainly meant us to read this story in
terms of his protest and his insurrection against the emptiness and
arrogance of law, against the folly and the pride of judges. Everything
else that there is in this story entered into it through the unconscious
or accidental energy of his genius, which broke in at every gap. But it
was the tragedy of Richard Carstone that he meant, not the comedy of
Harold Skimpole. He could not help being amusing; but he meant to be
depressing.</p>

<p>Another case might be taken as testing the greater seriousness of this
tale. The passages about Mrs. Jellyby and her philanthropic schemes show
Dickens at his best in his old and more familiar satiric manner. But in
the midst of the Jellyby pandemonium, which is in itself described with
the same <i>abandon</i> and irrelevance as the boarding-house of Mrs. Todgers
or the travelling theatre of Mr. Crummles, the elder Dickens introduced
another piece of pure truth and even tenderness. I mean the account of
Caddy Jellyby. If Carstone is a truly masculine study of how a man goes
wrong, Caddy is a perfectly feminine study of how a girl goes right.
Nowhere else perhaps in fiction, and certainly nowhere else in Dickens,
is the mere female paradox so well epitomised, the unjust use of words
covering so much capacity for a justice of ultimate estimate; the
seeming irresponsibility in language concealing such a fixed and
pitiless sense of responsibility <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
about things; the air of being always at daggers-drawn with her own
kindred, yet the confession of incurable kinship implied in pride and
shame; and, above all, that thirst for order and beauty as for something
physical; that strange female power of hating ugliness and waste as good
men can only hate sin and bad men virtue. Every touch in her is true,
from her first bewildering outbursts of hating people because she likes
them, down to the sudden quietude and good sense which announces that
she has slipped into her natural place as a woman. Miss Clare is a
figure-head, Miss Summerson in some ways a failure; but Miss Caddy
Jellyby is by far the greatest, the most human, and the most really
dignified of all the heroines of Dickens.</p>

<p>With one or two exceptions, all the effects in this story are of this
somewhat quieter kind, though none of them are so subtly successful as
Rick Carstone and Caddy. Harold Skimpole begins as a sketch drawn with a
pencil almost as airy and fanciful as his own. The humour of the earlier
scenes is delightful&mdash;the scenes in which Skimpole looks on at other
people paying his debts with the air of a kindly outsider, and suggests
in formless legal phraseology that they might &ldquo;sign
something&rdquo; or &ldquo;make over something,&rdquo; or the scene in
which he tries to explain the advantages of accepting everything to the
apoplectic Mr. Boythorn. But it was one of the defects of Dickens as a
novelist that his characters always became coarser and clumsier as they
passed through the practical events of a story, and this would
necessarily be so with Skimpole, whose position was conceivable even to
himself only on the assumption that he was a mere spectator of life.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
Poor Skimpole only asked to be kept out of the business of this world,
and Dickens ought to have kept him out of the business of <i>Bleak House</i>.
By the end of the tale he has brought Skimpole to doing acts of mere low
villainy. This altogether spoils the ironical daintiness of the original
notion. Skimpole was meant to end with a note of interrogation. As it
is, he ends with a big, black, unmistakable blot. Speaking purely
artistically, we may say that this is as great a collapse or
vulgarisation as if Richard Carstone had turned into a common blackguard
and wife-beater, or Caddy Jellyby into a comic and illiterate landlady.
Upon the whole it may, I think, be said that the character of Skimpole
is rather a piece of brilliant moralising than of pure observation or
creation. Dickens had a singularly just mind. He was wild in his
caricatures, but very sane in his impressions. Many of his books were
devoted, and this book is partly devoted, to a denunciation of
aristocracy&mdash;of the idle class that lives easily upon the toil of
nations. But he was fairer than many modern revolutionists, and he
insisted on satirising also those who prey on society not in the name of
rank or law, but in the name of intellect and beauty. Sir Leicester
Dedlock and Mr. Harold Skimpole are alike in accepting with a royal
unconsciousness the anomaly and evil of their position. But the idleness
and insolence of the aristocrat is human and humble compared to the
idleness and insolence of the artist.</p>

<p>With the exception of a few fine freaks, such as Turveydrop and
Chadband, all the figures in this book are touched more delicately, even
more faintly, than is common with Dickens. But if the figures are
touched <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
more faintly, it is partly because they are figures in a fog&mdash;the
fog of Chancery. Dickens meant that twilight to be oppressive; for it
was the symbol of oppression. Deliberately he did not dispel the
darkness at the end of this book, as he does dispel it at the end of
most of his books. Pickwick gets out of the Fleet Prison; Carstone never
gets out of Chancery but by death. This tyranny, Dickens said, shall not
be lifted by the light subterfuge of a fiction. This tyranny shall never
be lifted till all Englishmen lift it together.</p>

<hr /><p class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></p>
<h2><a name="HISTORY" id="HISTORY"></a>CHILD&rsquo;S HISTORY OF ENGLAND</h2>

<p>There are works of great authors manifestly inferior to their typical
work which are yet necessary to their fame and their figure in the
world. It is not difficult to recall examples of them. No one, for
instance, would talk of Scott&rsquo;s <i>Tales of a Grandfather</i> as
indicating the power that produced <i>Kenilworth</i> and <i>Guy Mannering</i>.
Nevertheless, without this chance minor compilation we should not really
have the key of Scott. Without this one insignificant book we should not
see his significance. For the truth was that Scott loved history more
than romance, because he was so constituted as to find it more romantic
than romance. He preferred the deeds of Wallace and Douglas to those of
Marmion and Ivanhoe. Therefore his garrulous gossip of old times, his
rambles in dead centuries, give us the real material and impulse of all
his work; they represent the quarry in which he dug and the food on
which he fed. Almost alone among novelists Scott actually preferred
those parts of his historical novels which he had not invented himself.
He exults when he can boast in an eager note that he has stolen some
saying from history. Thus <i>The Tales of a Grandfather</i>, though small, is
in some sense the frame of all the Waverley novels. We realise that all
Scott&rsquo;s novels are tales of a grandfather.</p>

<p>What has been said here about Scott might be said
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
in a less degree about Thackeray&rsquo;s <i>Four Georges</i>. Though
standing higher among his works than <i>The Tales of a Grandfather</i> among
Scott&rsquo;s they are not his works of genius; yet they seem in some
way to surround, supplement, and explain such works. Without the <i>Four
Georges</i> we should know less of the link that bound Thackeray to the
beginning and to the end of the eighteenth century; thence we should
have known less of Colonel Esmond and also less of Lord Steyne. To these
two examples I have given of the slight historical experiments of two
novelists a third has to be added. The third great master of English
fiction whose glory fills the nineteenth century also produced a small
experiment in the popularisation of history. It is separated from the
other two partly by a great difference of merit but partly also by an
utter difference of tone and outlook. We seem to hear it suddenly as in
the first words spoken by a new voice, a voice gay, colloquial, and
impatient. Scott and Thackeray were tenderly attached to the past;
Dickens (in his consciousness at any rate) was impatient with
everything, but especially impatient with the past.</p>

<p>A collection of the works of Dickens would be incomplete in an essential
as well as a literal sense without his <i>Child&rsquo;s History of
England</i>. It may not be important as a contribution to history, but it
is important as a contribution to biography; as a contribution to the
character and the career of the man who wrote it, a typical man of his
time. That he had made no personal historical researches, that he had no
special historical learning, that he had not had, in truth, even
anything that could be called a good education, all <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
this only accentuates not the merit but at least the importance of the
book. For here we may read in plain popular language, written by a man
whose genius for popular exposition has never been surpassed among men,
a brief account of the origin and meaning of England as it seemed to the
average Englishman of that age. When subtler views of our history, some
more false and some more true than his, have become popular, or at least
well known, when in the near future Carlylean or Catholic or Marxian
views of history have spread themselves among the reading public, this
book will always remain as a bright and brisk summary of the cock-sure,
healthy-minded, essentially manly and essentially ungentlemanly view of
history which characterised the Radicals of that particular Radical era.
The history tells us nothing about the periods that it talks about; but
it tells us a great deal about the period that it does not talk about;
the period in which it was written. It is in no sense a history of
England from the Roman invasion; but it is certainly one of the
documents which will contribute to a history of England in the
nineteenth century.</p>

<p>Of the actual nature of its philosophical and technical limitations it
is, I suppose, unnecessary to speak. They all resolve themselves into
one fault common in the modern world, and certainly characteristic of
historians much more learned and pretentious than Dickens. That fault
consists simply in ignoring or underrating the variety of strange evils
and unique dangers in the world. The Radicals of the nineteenth century
were engaged, and most righteously engaged, in dealing with one
particular problem of human <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
civilisation; they were shifting and apportioning more equally a load
of custom that had really become unmeaning, often accidental, and nearly
always unfair. Thus, for instance, a fierce and fighting penal code,
which had been perfectly natural when the robbers were as strong as the
Government, had become in more ordered times nothing but a base and
bloody habit. Thus again Church powers and dues, which had been human
when every man felt the Church as the best part of himself, were mere
mean privileges when the nation was full of sects and full of
freethinkers. This clearing away of external symbols that no longer
symbolised anything was an honourable and needful work; but it was so
difficult that to the men engaged in it it blocked up the perspective
and filled the sky, so that they slid into a very natural mental mistake
which coloured all their views of history. They supposed that this
particular problem on which they were engaged was the one problem upon
which all mankind had always been engaged. They got it into their heads
that breaking away from a dead past was the perpetual process of
humanity. The truth is obviously that humanity has found itself in many
difficulties very different from that. Sometimes the best business of an
age is to resist some alien invasion; sometimes to preach practical
self-control in a world too self-indulgent and diffused; sometimes to
prevent the growth in the State of great new private enterprises that
would poison or oppress it. Above all it may sometimes happen that the
highest task of a thinking citizen may be to do the exact opposite of
the work which the Radicals had to do. It may be his <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
highest duty to cling on to every scrap of the past that he can find,
if he feels that the ground is giving way beneath him and sinking into
mere savagery and forgetfulness of all human culture. This was exactly
the position of all thinking men in what we call the dark ages, say from
the sixth to the tenth century. The cheap progressive view of history
can never make head or tail of that epoch; it was an epoch upside down.
We think of the old things as barbaric and the new things as
enlightened. In that age all the enlightened things were old; all the
barbaric and brutally ignorant things were new and up to date.
Republicanism was a fading legend; despotism was a new and successful
experiment. Christianity was not only better than the clans that
rebelled against it; Christianity was more rationalistic than they were.
When men looked back they saw progress and reason; when they looked
forward they saw shapeless tradition and tribal terror. Touching such an
age it is obvious that all our modern terms describing reform or
conservation are foolish and beside the mark. The Conservative was then
the only possible reformer. If a man did not strengthen the remains of
Roman order and the root of Roman Christianity, he was simply helping
the world to roll downhill into ruin and idiotcy. Remember all these
evident historical truths and then turn to the account given by Charles
Dickens of that great man, St. Dunstan. It is not that the pert cockney
tone of the abuse is irritating to the nerves: it is that he has got the
whole hang of the thing wrong. His head is full of the
nineteenth-century situation; that a priest imposing discipline is a
person somehow blocking the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
way to equality and light. Whereas the point about such a man as
Dunstan was that nobody in the place except he cared a button about
equality or light: and that he was defending what was left of them
against the young and growing power of darkness and division and caste.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the case against such books as this is commonly stated
wrong. The fault of Dickens is not (as is often said) that he
&ldquo;applies the same moral standard to all ages.&rdquo; Every sane
man must do that: a moral standard must remain the same or it is not a
moral standard. If we call St. Anthony of Padua a good man, we must mean
what we mean when we call Huxley a good man, or else there is no sense
in using the word &ldquo;good.&rdquo; The fault of the Dickens school of
popular history lies, not in the application of a plain rule of right
and wrong to all circumstances, but in ignorance of the circumstances to
which it was applied. It is not that they wrongly enforce the fixed
principle that life should be saved; it is that they take a fire-engine
to a shipwreck and a lifeboat to a house on fire. The business of a good
man in Dickens&rsquo;s time was to bring justice up to date. The
business of a good man in Dunstan&rsquo;s time was to toil to ensure the
survival of any justice at all.</p>

<p>And Dickens, through being a living and fighting man of his own time,
kept the health of his own heart, and so saw many truths with a single
eye: truths that were spoilt for subtler eyes. He was much more really
right than Carlyle; immeasurably more right than Froude. He was more
right precisely because he applied plain human morals to all facts as he
saw them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
Carlyle really had a vague idea that in coarse and cruel times it was
right to be coarse and cruel; that tyranny was excusable in the twelfth
century: as if the twelfth century did not denounce tyrants as much or
more than any other. Carlyle, in fact, fancied that Rufus was the right
sort of man; a view which was not only not shared by Anselm, but was
probably not shared by Rufus. In this connection, or rather in
connection with the other case of Froude, it is worth while to take
another figure from Dickens&rsquo;s history, which illustrates the other
and better side of the facile and popular method. Sheer ignorance of the
environment made him wrong about Dunstan. But sheer instinct and good
moral tradition made him right, for instance, about Henry VIII.; right
where Froude is wildly wrong. Dickens&rsquo;s imagination could not
re-picture an age where learning and liberty were dying rather than
being born: but Henry VIII. lived in a time of expanding knowledge and
unrest; a time therefore somewhat like the Victorian. And Dickens in his
childish but robust way does perceive the main point about him: that he
was a wicked man. He misses all the fine shades, of course; he makes him
every kind of wicked man at once. He leaves out the serious interests of
the man: his strange but real concern for theology; his love of certain
legal and moral forms; his half-unconscious patriotism. But he sees the
solid bulk of definite badness simply because it was there; and Froude
cannot see it at all; because Froude followed Carlyle and played tricks
with the eternal conscience. Henry VIII. <i>was</i> &ldquo;a blot of blood
and grease upon the history of England.&rdquo; For he was the embodiment
of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
Devil in the Renascence, that wild worship of mere pleasure and scorn,
which with its pictures and its palaces has enriched and ruined the
world.</p>

<p>The time will soon come when the mere common-sense of Dickens, like the
mere common-sense of Macaulay (though his was poisoned by learning and
Whig politics), will appear to give a plainer and therefore truer
picture of the mass of history than the mystical perversity of a man of
genius writing only out of his own temperament, like Carlyle or Taine.
If a man has a new theory of ethics there is one thing he must not be
allowed to do. Let him give laws on Sinai, let him dictate a Bible, let
him fill the world with cathedrals if he can. But he must not be allowed
to write a history of England; or a history of any country. All history
was conducted on ordinary morality: with his extraordinary morality he
is certain to read it all askew. Thus Carlyle tries to write of the
Middle Ages with a bias against humility and mercy; that is, with a bias
against the whole theoretic morality of the Middle Ages. The result is
that he turns into a mere turmoil of arrogant German savages what was
really the most complete and logical, if not the highest, of human
civilisations. Historically speaking, it is better to be Dickens than to
be this; better to be ignorant, provincial, slap-dash, seeing only the
passing moment, but in that moment, to be true to eternal things.</p>

<p>It must be remembered, of course, that Dickens deliberately offers this
only as a &ldquo;child&rsquo;s&rdquo; history of England. That is, he
only professes to be able to teach history as any father of a little boy
of five professes to be able to teach him history. And although
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
the history of England would certainly be taught very differently (as
regards the actual criticism of events and men) in a family with a wider
culture or with another religion, the general method would be the same.
For the general method is quite right. This black-and-white history of
heroes and villains; this history full of pugnacious ethics and of
nothing else, is the right kind of history for children. I have often
wondered how the scientific Marxians and the believers in &ldquo;the
materialist view of history&rdquo; will ever manage to teach their
dreary economic generalisations to children: but I suppose they will
have no children. Dickens&rsquo;s history will always be popular with
the young; almost as popular as Dickens&rsquo;s novels, and for the same
reason: because it is full of moralising. Science and art without
morality are not dangerous in the sense commonly supposed. They are not
dangerous like a fire, but dangerous like a fog. A fire is dangerous in
its brightness; a fog in its dulness; and thought without morals is
merely dull, like a fog. The fog seems to be creeping up the street;
putting out lamp after lamp. But this cockney lamp-post which the
children love is still crowned with its flame; and when the fathers have
forgotten ethics, their babies will turn and teach them.</p>

<hr /><p class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></p>
<h2><a name="HARD_TIMES" id="HARD_TIMES"></a>HARD TIMES</h2>

<p>I have heard that in some debating clubs there is a rule that the
members may discuss anything except religion and politics. I cannot
imagine what they do discuss; but it is quite evident that they have
ruled out the only two subjects which are either important or amusing.
The thing is a part of a certain modern tendency to avoid things because
they lead to warmth; whereas, obviously, we ought, even in a social
sense, to seek those things specially. The warmth of the discussion is
as much a part of hospitality as the warmth of the fire. And it is
singularly suggestive that in English literature the two things have
died together. The very people who would blame Dickens for his
sentimental hospitality are the very people who would also blame him for
his narrow political conviction. The very people who would mock him for
his narrow radicalism are those who would mock him for his broad
fireside. Real conviction and real charity are much nearer than people
suppose. Dickens was capable of loving all men; but he refused to love
all opinions. The modern humanitarian can love all opinions, but he
cannot love all men; he seems, sometimes, in the ecstasy of his
humanitarianism, even to hate them all. He can love all opinions,
including the opinion that men are unlovable.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
In feeling Dickens as a lover we must never forget him as a fighter, and
a fighter for a creed; but indeed there is no other kind of fighter. The
geniality which he spread over all his creations was geniality spread
from one centre, from one flaming peak. He was willing to excuse Mr.
Micawber for being extravagant; but Dickens and Dickens&rsquo;s doctrine
were strictly to decide how far he was to be excused. He was willing to
like Mr. Twemlow in spite of his snobbishness, but Dickens and
Dickens&rsquo;s doctrine were alone to be judges of how far he was
snobbish. There was never a more didactic writer: hence there was never
one more amusing. He had no mean modern notion of keeping the moral
doubtful. He would have regarded this as a mere piece of slovenliness,
like leaving the last page illegible.</p>

<p>Everywhere in Dickens&rsquo;s work these angles of his absolute opinion
stood up out of the confusion of his general kindness, just as sharp and
splintered peaks stand up out of the soft confusion of the forests.
Dickens is always generous, he is generally kind-hearted, he is often
sentimental, he is sometimes intolerably maudlin; but you never know
when you will not come upon one of the convictions of Dickens; and when
you do come upon it you do know it. It is as hard and as high as any
precipice or peak of the mountains. The highest and hardest of these
peaks is <i>Hard Times</i>.</p>

<p>It is here more than anywhere else that the sternness of Dickens emerges
as separate from his softness; it is here, most obviously, so to speak,
that his bones stick out. There are indeed many other books of his which
are written better and written in a sadder tone. <i>Great Expectations</i> is
melancholy in a sense; but it is doubtful <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
of everything, even of its own melancholy. <i>The Tale of Two Cities</i> is
a great tragedy, but it is still a sentimental tragedy. It is a great
drama, but it is still a melodrama. But this tale of <i>Hard Times</i> is in
some way harsher than all these. For it is the expression of a righteous
indignation which cannot condescend to humour and which cannot even
condescend to pathos. Twenty times we have taken Dickens&rsquo;s hand
and it has been sometimes hot with revelry and sometimes weak with
weariness; but this time we start a little, for it is inhumanly cold;
and then we realise that we have touched his gauntlet of steel.</p>

<p>One cannot express the real value of this book without being irrelevant.
It is true that one cannot express the real value of anything without
being irrelevant. If we take a thing frivolously we can take it
separately, but the moment we take a thing seriously, if it were only an
old umbrella, it is obvious that that umbrella opens above us into the
immensity of the whole universe. But there are rather particular reasons
why the value of the book called <i>Hard Times</i> should be referred back to
great historic and theoretic matters with which it may appear
superficially to have little or nothing to do. The chief reason can
perhaps be stated thus&mdash;that English politics had for more than a
hundred years been getting into more and more of a hopeless tangle (a
tangle which, of course, has since become even worse) and that Dickens
did in some extraordinary way see what was wrong, even if he did not see
what was right.</p>

<p>The Liberalism which Dickens and nearly all of his contemporaries
professed had begun in the American and the French Revolutions. Almost
all modern<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
English criticism upon those revolutions has been vitiated by the
assumption that those revolutions burst upon a world which was
unprepared for their ideas&mdash;a world ignorant of the possibility of
such ideas. Somewhat the same mistake is made by those who suggest that
Christianity was adopted by a world incapable of criticising it; whereas
obviously it was adopted by a world that was tired of criticising
everything. The vital mistake that is made about the French Revolution
is merely this&mdash;that everyone talks about it as the introduction of
a new idea. It was not the introduction of a new idea; there are no new
ideas. Or if there are new ideas, they would not cause the least
irritation if they were introduced into political society; because the
world having never got used to them there would be no mass of men ready
to fight for them at a moment&rsquo;s notice. That which was irritating
about the French Revolution was this&mdash;that it was not the
introduction of a new ideal, but the practical fulfilment of an old one.
From the time of the first fairy tales men had always believed ideally
in equality; they had always thought that something ought to be done, if
anything could be done, to redress the balance between Cinderella and
the ugly sisters. The irritating thing about the French was not that
they said this ought to be done; everybody said that. The irritating
thing about the French was that they did it. They proposed to carry out
into a positive scheme what had been the vision of humanity; and
humanity was naturally annoyed. The kings of Europe did not make war
upon the Revolution because it was a blasphemy, but because it was a
copy-book maxim which had been just too accurately copied. It
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
was a platitude which they had always held in theory unexpectedly put
into practice. The tyrants did not hate democracy because it was a
paradox; they hated it because it was a truism which seemed in some
danger of coming true.</p>

<p>Now it happens to be hugely important to have this right view of the
Revolution in considering its political effects upon England. For the
English, being a deeply and indeed excessively romantic people, could
never be quite content with this quality of cold and bald obviousness
about the republican formula. The republican formula was merely
this&mdash;that the State must consist of its citizens ruling equally,
however unequally they may do anything else. In their capacity of
members of the State they are all equally interested in its
preservation. But the English soon began to be romantically restless
about this eternal truism; they were perpetually trying to turn it into
something else, into something more picturesque&mdash;progress perhaps, or
anarchy. At last they turned it into the highly exciting and highly
unsound system of politics, which was known as the Manchester School,
and which was expressed with a sort of logical flightiness, more
excusable in literature, by Mr. Herbert Spencer. Of course Danton or
Washington or any of the original republicans would have thought these
people were mad. They would never have admitted for a moment that the
State must not interfere with commerce or competition; they would merely
have insisted that if the State did interfere, it must really be the
State&mdash;that is, the whole people. But the distance between the common
sense of Danton and the mere ecstasy of Herbert Spencer marks
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
the English way of colouring and altering the revolutionary idea. The
English people as a body went blind, as the saying is, for interpreting
democracy entirely in terms of liberty. They said in substance that if
they had more and more liberty it did not matter whether they had any
equality or any fraternity. But this was violating the sacred trinity of
true politics; they confounded the persons and they divided the
substance.</p>

<p>Now the really odd thing about England in the nineteenth century is
this&mdash;that there was one Englishman who happened to keep his head. The
men who lost their heads lost highly scientific and philosophical heads;
they were great cosmic systematisers like Spencer, great social
philosophers like Bentham, great practical politicians like Bright,
great political economists like Mill. The man who kept his head kept a
head full of fantastic nonsense; he was a writer of rowdy farces, a
demagogue of fiction, a man without education in any serious sense
whatever, a man whose whole business was to turn ordinary cockneys into
extraordinary caricatures. Yet when all these other children of the
revolution went wrong he, by a mystical something in his bones, went
right. He knew nothing of the Revolution; yet he struck the note of it.
He returned to the original sentimental commonplace upon which it is
forever founded, as the Church is founded on a rock. In an England gone
mad about a minor theory he reasserted the original idea&mdash;the idea that
no one in the State must be too weak to influence the State.</p>

<p>This man was Dickens. He did this work much more genuinely than it was
done by Carlyle or Ruskin; <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
for they were simply Tories making out a romantic case for the return
of Toryism. But Dickens was a real Liberal demanding the return of real
Liberalism. Dickens was there to remind people that England had rubbed
out two words of the revolutionary motto, had left only Liberty and
destroyed Equality and Fraternity. In this book, <i>Hard Times</i>, he
specially champions equality. In all his books he champions fraternity.</p>

<p>The atmosphere of this book and what it stands for can be very
adequately conveyed in the note on the book by Lord Macaulay, who may
stand as a very good example of the spirit of England in those years of
eager emancipation and expanding wealth&mdash;the years in which Liberalism
was turned from an omnipotent truth to a weak scientific system.
Macaulay&rsquo;s private comment on <i>Hard Times</i> runs, &ldquo;One or two
passages of exquisite pathos and the rest sullen Socialism.&rdquo; That
is not an unfair and certainly not a specially hostile criticism, but it
exactly shows how the book struck those people who were mad on political
liberty and dead about everything else. Macaulay mistook for a new
formula called Socialism what was, in truth, only the old formula called
political democracy. He and his Whigs had so thoroughly mauled and
modified the original idea of Rousseau or Jefferson that when they saw
it again they positively thought that it was something quite new and
eccentric. But the truth was that Dickens was not a Socialist, but an
unspoilt Liberal; he was not sullen; nay, rather, he had remained
strangely hopeful. They called him a sullen Socialist only to disguise
their astonishment at finding still loose about the London streets a
happy republican.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
Dickens is the one living link between the old kindness and the new,
between the good will of the past and the good works of the future. He
links May Day with Bank Holiday, and he does it almost alone. All the
men around him, great and good as they were, were in comparison
puritanical, and never so puritanical as when they were also atheistic.
He is a sort of solitary pipe down which pours to the twentieth century
the original river of Merry England. And although this <i>Hard Times</i> is,
as its name implies, the hardest of his works, although there is less in
it perhaps than in any of the others of the <i>abandon</i> and the buffoonery
of Dickens, this only emphasises the more clearly the fact that he stood
almost alone for a more humane and hilarious view of democracy. None of
his great and much more highly-educated contemporaries could help him in
this. Carlyle was as gloomy on the one side as Herbert Spencer on the
other. He protested against the commercial oppression simply and solely
because it was not only an oppression but a depression. And this protest
of his was made specially in the case of the book before us. It may be
bitter, but it was a protest against bitterness. It may be dark, but it
is the darkness of the subject and not of the author. He is by his own
account dealing with hard times, but not with a hard eternity, not with
a hard philosophy of the universe. Nevertheless, this is the one place
in his work where he does not make us remember human happiness by
example as well as by precept. This is, as I have said, not the saddest,
but certainly the harshest of his stories. It is perhaps the only place
where Dickens, in defending happiness, for a moment forgets to be
happy.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
He describes Bounderby and Gradgrind with a degree of grimness and
sombre hatred very different from the half affectionate derision which
he directed against the old tyrants or humbugs of the earlier nineteenth
century&mdash;the pompous Dedlock or the fatuous Nupkins, the grotesque
Bumble or the inane Tigg. In those old books his very abuse was
benignant; in <i>Hard Times</i> even his sympathy is hard. And the reason is
again to be found in the political facts of the century. Dickens could
be half genial with the older generation of oppressors because it was a
dying generation. It was evident, or at least it seemed evident then,
that Nupkins could not go on much longer making up the law of England to
suit himself; that Sir Leicester Dedlock could not go on much longer
being kind to his tenants as if they were dogs and cats. And some of
these evils the nineteenth century did really eliminate or improve. For
the first half of the century Dickens and all his friends were justified
in feeling that the chains were falling from mankind. At any rate, the
chains did fall from Mr. Rouncewell the Iron-master. And when they fell
from him he picked them up and put them upon the poor.</p>

<h2><a name="DORRIT" id="DORRIT"></a>LITTLE DORRIT</h2>

<p><i>Little Dorrit</i> stands in Dickens&rsquo;s life chiefly as a signal of
how far he went down the road of realism, of sadness, and of what is
called modernity. True, it was by no means the best of the books of his
later period; some even think it the worst. <i>Great Expectations</i> is
certainly the best of the later novels; some even think it the best of
all the novels. Nor is it the novel most concerned with strictly recent
problems; that title must be given to <i>Hard Times</i>. Nor again is it the
most finely finished or well constructed of the later books; that claim
can be probably made for <i>Edwin Drood</i>. By a queer verbal paradox the
most carefully finished of his later tales is the tale that is not
finished at all. In form, indeed, the book bears a superficial
resemblance to those earlier works by which the young Dickens had set
the whole world laughing long ago. Much of the story refers to a remote
time early in the nineteenth century; much of it was actually recalled
and copied from the life of Dickens&rsquo;s father in the old Marshalsea
prison. Also the narrative has something of the form, or rather absence
of form, which belonged to <i>Nicholas Nickleby</i> or <i>Martin Chuzzlewit</i>.
It has something of the old air of being a string of disconnected
adventures, like a boy&rsquo;s book about bears and Indians. The Dorrits
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
go wandering for no particular reason on the Continent of Europe, just
as young Martin Chuzzlewit went wandering for no particular reason on
the continent of America. The story of <i>Little Dorrit</i> stops and lingers
at the doors of the Circumlocution Office much in the same way that the
story of Samuel Pickwick stops and lingers in the political excitement
of Eatanswill. The villain, Blandois, is a very stagey villain indeed;
quite as stagey as Ralph Nickleby or the mysterious Monk. The secret of
the dark house of Clennam is a very silly secret; quite as silly as the
secret of Ralph Nickleby or the secret of Monk. Yet all these external
similarities between <i>Little Dorrit</i> and the earliest books, all this
loose, melodramatic quality, only serves to make more obvious and
startling the fact that some change has come over the soul of Dickens.
<i>Hard Times</i> is harsh; but then <i>Hard Times</i> is a social pamphlet;
perhaps it is only harsh as a social pamphlet must be harsh. <i>Bleak
House</i> is a little sombre; but then <i>Bleak House</i> is almost a detective
story; perhaps it is only sombre in the sense that a detective story
must be sombre. <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i> is a tragedy; but then <i>A Tale of
Two Cities</i> is a tale of the French Revolution; perhaps it is only a
tragedy because the French Revolution was a tragedy. <i>The Mystery of
Edwin Drood</i> is dark; but then the mystery of anybody must be dark. In
all these other cases of the later books an artistic reason can be
given&mdash;a reason of theme or of construction for the slight sadness
that seems to cling to them. But exactly because <i>Little Dorrit</i> is a
mere Dickens novel, it shows that something must somehow have happened
to Dickens himself. Even in resuming <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
his old liberty, he cannot resume his old hilarity. He can re-create
the anarchy, but not the revelry.</p>

<p>It so happens that this strange difference between the new and the old
mode of Dickens can be symbolised and stated in one separate and simple
contrast. Dickens&rsquo;s father had been a prisoner in a debtors&rsquo;
prison, and Dickens&rsquo;s works contain two pictures partly suggested
by the personality of that prisoner. Mr. Micawber is one picture of him.
Mr. Dorrit is another. This truth is almost incredible, but it is the
truth. The joyful Micawber, whose very despair was exultant, and the
desolate Dorrit, whose very pride was pitiful, were the same man. The
valiant Micawber and the nervous, shaking Dorrit were the same man. The
defiant Micawber and the snobbish, essentially obsequious Dorrit were
the same man. I do not mean of course that either of the pictures was an
exact copy of anybody. The whole Dickens genius consisted of taking
hints and turning them into human beings. As he took twenty real persons
and turned them into one fictitious person, so he took one real person
and turned him into twenty fictitious persons. This quality would
suggest one character, that quality would suggest another. But in this
case, at any rate, he did take one real person and turn him into two.
And what is more, he turned him into two persons who seem to be quite
opposite persons. To ordinary readers of Dickens, to say that Micawber
and Dorrit had in any sense the same original, will appear unexpected
and wild. No conceivable connection between the two would ever have
occurred to anybody who had read Dickens with simple and superficial
enjoyment, as all good literature ought to be read.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
It will seem to them just as silly as saying that the Fat Boy and Mr.
Alfred Jingle were both copied from the same character. It will seem as
insane as saying that the character of Smike and the character of Major
Bagstock were both copied from Dickens&rsquo;s father. Yet it is an
unquestionable historical fact that Micawber and Dorrit were both copied
from Dickens&rsquo;s father, in the only sense that any figures in good
literature are ever copied from anything or anybody. Dickens did get the
main idea of Micawber from his father; and that idea is that a poor man
is not conquered by the world. And Dickens did get the main idea of
Dorrit from his father; and that idea is that a poor man may be
conquered by the world. I shall take the opportunity of discussing, in a
moment, which of these ideas is true. Doubtless old John Dickens
included both the gay and the sad moral; most men do. My only purpose
here is to point out that Dickens drew the gay moral in 1849, and the
sad moral in 1857.</p>

<p>There must have been some real sadness at this time creeping like a
cloud over Dickens himself. It is nothing that a man dwells on the
darkness of dark things; all healthy men do that. It is when he dwells
on the darkness of bright things that we have reason to fear some
disease of the emotions. There must really have been some depression
when a man can only see the sad side of flowers or the sad side of
holidays or the sad side of wine. And there must be some depression of
an uncommonly dark and genuine character when a man has reached such a
point that he can see only the sad side of Mr. Wilkins Micawber.</p>

<p>Yet this is in reality what had happened to Dickens <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
about this time. Staring at Wilkins Micawber he could see only the
weakness and the tragedy that was made possible by his indifference, his
indulgence, and his bravado. He had already indeed been slightly moved
towards this study of the feebleness and ruin of the old epicurean type
with which he had once sympathised, the type of Bob Sawyer or Dick
Swiveller. He had already attacked the evil of it in <i>Bleak House</i> in
the character of Harold Skimpole, with its essentially cowardly
carelessness and its highly selfish communism. Nevertheless, as I have
said before, it must have been no small degree of actual melancholia
which led Dickens to look for a lesson of disaster and slavery in the
very same career from which he had once taught lessons of continual
recuperation and a kind of fantastic freedom. There must have been at
this time some melancholy behind the writings. There must have existed
on this earth at the time that portent and paradox&mdash;a somewhat
depressed Dickens.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was a reminiscence of that metaphorical proverb which tells
us that &ldquo;truth lies at the bottom of a well.&rdquo; Perhaps these
people thought that the only way to find truth in the well was to drown
oneself. But on whatever thin theoretic basis, the type and period of
George Gissing did certainly consider that Dickens, so far as he went,
was all the worse for the optimism of the story of Micawber; hence it is
not unnatural that they should think him all the better for the
comparative pessimism of the story of <i>Little Dorrit</i>. The very things
in the tale that would naturally displease the ordinary admirers of
Dickens, are the things which would naturally please a man like George
Gissing. There are <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
many of these things, but one of them emerges pre-eminent and
unmistakable. This is the fact that when all is said and done the main
business of the story of <i>Little Dorrit</i> is to describe the victory of
circumstances over a soul. The circumstances are the financial ruin and
long imprisonment of Edward Dorrit; the soul is Edward Dorrit himself.
Let it be granted that the circumstances are exceptional and oppressive,
are denounced as exceptional and oppressive, are finally exploded and
overthrown; still, they are circumstances. Let it be granted that the
soul is that of a man perhaps weak in any case and retaining many merits
to the last, still it is a soul. Let it be granted, above all, that the
admission that such spiritual tragedies do occur does not decrease by so
much as an iota our faith in the validity of any spiritual struggle. For
example, Stevenson has made a study of the breakdown of a good
man&rsquo;s character under a burden for which he is not to blame, in
the tragedy of Henry Durie in <i>The Master of Ballantrae</i>. Yet he has
added, in the mouth of Mackellar, the exact common sense and good
theology of the matter, saying &ldquo;It matters not a jot; for he that
is to pass judgment upon the records of our life is the same that formed
us in frailty.&rdquo; Let us concede then all this, and the fact remains
that the study of the slow demoralisation of a man through mere
misfortune was not a study congenial to Dickens, not in accordance with
his original inspiration, not connected in any manner with the special
thing that he had to say. In a word, the thing is not quite a part of
himself; and he was not quite himself when he did it.</p>

<p>He was still quite a young man; his depression did not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
come from age. In fact, as far as I know, mere depression never does
come from mere age. Age can pass into a beautiful reverie. Age can pass
into a sort of beautiful idiocy. But I do not think that the actual
decline and close of our ordinary vitality brings with it any particular
heaviness of the spirits. The spirits of the old do not as a rule seem
to become more and more ponderous until they sink into the earth. Rather
the spirits of the old seem to grow lighter and lighter until they float
away like thistledown. Wherever there is the definite phenomenon called
depression, it commonly means that something else has been closer to us
than so normal a thing as death. There has been disease, bodily or
mental, or there has been sin, or there has been some struggle or
effort, breaking past the ordinary boundaries of human custom. In the
case of Dickens there had been two things that are not of the routine of
a wholesome human life; there had been the quarrel with his wife, and
there had been the strain of incessant and exaggerated intellectual
labour. He had not an easy time; and on top of that (or perhaps rather
at the bottom of it) he had not an easy nature. Not only did his life
necessitate work, but his character necessitated worry about work; and
that combination is always one which is very dangerous to the
temperament which is exposed to it. The only people who ought to be
allowed to work are the people who are able to shirk. The only people
who ought to be allowed to worry are the people who have nothing to
worry about. When the two are combined, as they were in Dickens, you are
very likely to have at least one collapse. <i>Little Dorrit</i> is a very
interesting, sincere, and fascinating <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
book. But for all that, I fancy it is the one collapse.</p>

<p>The complete proof of this depression may be difficult to advance;
because it will be urged, and entirely with reason, that the actual
examples of it are artistic and appropriate. Dickens, the Gissing school
will say, was here pointing out certain sad truths of psychology; can
any one say that he ought not to point them out? That may be; in any
case, to explain depression is not to remove it. But the instances of
this more sombre quality of which I have spoken are not very hard to
find. The thing can easily be seen by comparing a book like <i>Little
Dorrit</i> with a book like <i>David Copperfield</i>. David Copperfield and
Arthur Clennam have both been brought up in unhappy homes, under bitter
guardians and a black, disheartening religion. It is the whole point of
David Copperfield that he has broken out of a Calvinistic tyranny which
he cannot forgive. But it is the whole point of Arthur Clennam that he
has not broken out of the Calvinistic tyranny, but is still under its
shadow. Copperfield has come from a gloomy childhood; Clennam, though
forty years old, is still in a gloomy childhood. When David meets the
Murdstones again it is to defy them with the health and hilarious anger
that go with his happy delirium about Dora. But when Clennam re-enters
his sepulchral house there is a weight upon his soul which makes it
impossible for him to answer, with any spirit, the morbidities of his
mother, or even the grotesque interferences of Mr. Flintwinch. This is
only another example of the same quality which makes the Dickens of
<i>Little Dorrit</i> insist on the degradation of the debtor, while the
Dickens of <i>David Copperfield</i> insisted on his <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
splendid irresponsibility, his essential emancipation. Imprisonments
passed over Micawber like summer clouds. But the imprisonment in <i>Little
Dorrit</i> is like a complete natural climate and environment; it has
positively modified the shapes and functions of the animals that dwell
in it. A horrible thing has happened to Dickens; he has almost become an
Evolutionist. Worse still, in studying the Calvinism of Mrs.
Clennam&rsquo;s house, he has almost become a Calvinist. He half
believes (as do some of the modern scientists) that there is really such
a thing as &ldquo;a child of wrath,&rdquo; that a man on whom such an
early shadow had fallen could never shake it off. For ancient Calvinism
and modern Evolutionism are essentially the same things. They are both
ingenious logical blasphemies against the dignity and liberty of the
human soul.</p>

<p>The workmanship of the book in detail is often extremely good. The one
passage in the older and heartier Dickens manner (I mean the description
of the Circumlocution Office) is beyond praise. It is a complete picture
of the way England is actually governed at this moment. The very core of
our politics is expressed in the light and easy young Barnacle who told
Clennam with a kindly frankness that he, Clennam, would &ldquo;never go
on with it.&rdquo; Dickens hit the mark so that the bell rang when he
made all the lower officials, who were cads, tell Clennam coldly that
his claim was absurd, until the last official, who is a gentleman, tells
him genially that the whole business is absurd. Even here, perhaps,
there is something more than the old exuberant derision of Dickens;
there is a touch of experience that verges on scepticism.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
Everywhere else, certainly, there is the note which I have called
Calvinistic; especially in the predestined passion of Tattycoram or the
incurable cruelty of Miss Wade. Even Little Dorrit herself had, we are
told, one stain from her prison experience; and it is spoken of like a
bodily stain; like something that cannot be washed away.</p>

<p>There is no denying that this is Dickens&rsquo;s dark moment. It adds
enormously to the value of his general view of life that such a dark
moment came. He did what all the heroes and all the really happy men
have done; he descended into Hell. Nor is it irreverent to continue the
quotation from the Creed, for in the next book he was to write he was to
break out of all these dreams of fate and failure, and with his highest
voice to speak of the triumph of the weak of this world. His next book
was to leave us saying, as Sydney Carton mounted the scaffold, words
which, splendid in themselves, have never been so splendidly
quoted&mdash;&ldquo;I am the Resurrection and the Life; whoso believeth in Me
though he be dead yet he shall live.&rdquo; In Sydney Carton at least,
Dickens shows none of that dreary submission to the environment of the
irrevocable that had for an instant lain on him like a cloud. On this
occasion he sees with the old heroic clearness that to be a failure may
be one step to being a saint. On the third day he rose again from the
dead.</p>

<h2><a name="TWO_CITIES" id="TWO_CITIES"></a>A TALE OF TWO CITIES</h2>

<p>As an example of Dickens&rsquo;s literary work, <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i>
is not wrongly named. It is his most typical contact with the civic
ideals of Europe. All his other tales have been tales of one city. He
was in spirit a Cockney; though that title has been quite unreasonably
twisted to mean a cad. By the old sound and proverbial test a Cockney
was a man born within the sound of Bow bells. That is, he was a man born
within the immediate appeal of high civilisation and of eternal
religion. Shakespeare, in the heart of his fantastic forest, turns with
a splendid suddenness to the Cockney ideal as being the true one after
all. For a jest, for a reaction, for an idle summer love or still idler
summer hatred, it is well to wander away into the bewildering forest of
Arden. It is well that those who are sick with love or sick with the
absence of love, those who weary of the folly of courts or weary yet
more of their wisdom, it is natural that these should trail away into
the twinkling twilight of the woods. Yet it is here that Shakespeare
makes one of his most arresting and startling assertions of the truth.
Here is one of those rare and tremendous moments of which one may say
that there is a stage direction, &ldquo;Enter Shakespeare.&rdquo; He has
admitted that for men weary of courts, for men sick of cities, the wood
is the wisest place, and he has <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
praised it with his purest lyric ecstasy. But when a man enters
suddenly upon that celestial picnic, a man who is not sick of cities,
but sick of hunger, a man who is not weary of courts, but weary of
walking, then Shakespeare lets through his own voice with a shattering
sincerity and cries the praise of practical human civilisation:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">If ever you have looked on better days,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If ever you have sat at good men&rsquo;s feasts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If ever been where bells have knolled to church,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If ever from your eyelids wiped a tear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or know what &rsquo;tis to pity and be pitied.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There is nothing finer even in Shakespeare than that conception of the
circle of rich men all pretending to rough it in the country, and the
one really hungry man entering, sword in hand, and praising the city.
&ldquo;If ever been where bells have knolled to church&rdquo;; if you
have ever been within sound of Bow bells; if you have ever been happy
and haughty enough to call yourself a Cockney.</p>

<p>We must remember this distinction always in the case of Dickens. Dickens
is the great Cockney, at once tragic and comic, who enters abruptly upon
the Arcadian banquet of the &aelig;sthetics and says, &ldquo;Forbear and eat
no more,&rdquo; and tells them that they shall not eat &ldquo;until
necessity be served.&rdquo; If there was one thing he would have
favoured instinctively it would have been the spreading of the town as
meaning the spreading of civilisation. And we should (I hope) all favour
the spreading of the town if it did mean the spreading of civilisation.
The objection to the spreading <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
of the modern Manchester or Birmingham suburb is simply that such a
suburb is much more barbaric than any village in Europe could ever
conceivably be. And again, if there is anything that Dickens would have
definitely hated it is that general treatment of nature as a dramatic
spectacle, a piece of scene-painting which has become the common mark of
the culture of our wealthier classes. Despite many fine pictures of
natural scenery, especially along the English roadsides, he was upon the
whole emphatically on the side of the town. He was on the side of bricks
and mortar. He was a citizen; and, after all, a citizen means a man of
the city. His strength was, after all, in the fact that he was a man of
the city. But, after all, his weakness, his calamitous weakness, was
that he was a man of one city.</p>

<p>For all practical purposes he had never been outside such places as
Chatham and London. He did indeed travel on the Continent; but surely no
man&rsquo;s travel was ever so superficial as his. He was more
superficial than the smallest and commonest tourist. He went about
Europe on stilts; he never touched the ground. There is one good test
and one only of whether a man has travelled to any profit in Europe. An
Englishman is, as such, a European, and as he approaches the central
splendours of Europe he ought to feel that he is coming home. If he does
not feel at home he had much better have stopped at home. England is a
real home; London is a real home; and all the essential feelings of
adventure or the picturesque can easily be gained by going out at night
upon the flats of Essex or the cloven hills of Surrey. Your visit to
Europe is useless unless <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
it gives you the sense of an exile returning. Your first sight of Rome
is futile unless you feel that you have seen it before. Thus useless and
thus futile were the foreign experiments and the continental raids of
Dickens. He enjoyed them as he would have enjoyed, as a boy, a scamper
out of Chatham into some strange meadows, as he would have enjoyed, when
a grown man, a steam in a police boat out into the fens to the far east
of London. But he was the Cockney venturing far; he was not the European
coming home. He is still the splendid Cockney Orlando of whom I spoke
above; he cannot but suppose that any strange men, being happy in some
pastoral way, are mysterious foreign scoundrels. Dickens&rsquo;s real
speech to the lazy and laughing civilisation of Southern Europe would
really have run in the Shakespearian words:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">but whoe&rsquo;er you be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who in this desert inaccessible,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under the shade of melancholy boughs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lose and neglect the creeping hours of time.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If ever you have looked on better things,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If ever been where bells have knolled to church.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>If, in short, you have ever had the advantage of being born within the
sound of Bow bells. Dickens could not really conceive that there was any
other city but his own.</p>

<p>It is necessary thus to insist that Dickens never understood the
Continent, because only thus can we appreciate the really remarkable
thing he did in <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i>. It is necessary to feel, first
of all, the fact that to him London was the centre of the universe.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
He did not understand at all the real sense in which Paris is the
capital of Europe. He had never realised that all roads lead to Rome. He
had never felt (as an Englishman can feel) that he was an Athenian
before he was a Londoner. Yet with everything against him he did this
astonishing thing. He wrote a book about two cities, one of which he
understood; the other he did not understand. And his description of the
city he did not know is almost better than his description of the city
he did know. This is the entrance of the unquestionable thing about
Dickens; the thing called genius; the thing which every one has to talk
about directly and distinctly because no one knows what it is. For a
plain word (as for instance the word fool) always covers an infinite
mystery.</p>

<p><i>A Tale of Two Cities</i> is one of the more tragic tints of the later life
of Dickens. It might be said that he grew sadder as he grew older; but
this would be false, for two reasons. First, a man never or hardly ever
does grow sad as he grows old; on the contrary, the most melancholy
young lovers can be found forty years afterwards chuckling over their
port wine. And second, Dickens never did grow old, even in a physical
sense. What weariness did appear in him appeared in the prime of life;
it was due not to age but to overwork, and his exaggerative way of doing
everything. To call Dickens a victim of elderly disenchantment would be
as absurd as to say the same of Keats. Such fatigue as there was, was
due not to the slowing down of his blood, but rather to its unremitting
rapidity. He was not wearied by his age; rather he was wearied by his
youth. And though <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i> is full
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
of sadness, it is full also of enthusiasm; that pathos is a young
pathos rather than an old one. Yet there is one circumstance which does
render important the fact that <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i> is one of the
later works of Dickens. This fact is the fact of his dependence upon
another of the great writers of the Victorian era. And it is in
connection with this that we can best see the truth of which I have been
speaking; the truth that his actual ignorance of France went with
amazing intuitive perception of the truth about it. It is here that he
has most clearly the plain mark of the man of genius; that he can
understand what he does not understand.</p>

<p>Dickens was inspired to the study of the French Revolution and to the
writing of a romance about it by the example and influence of Carlyle.
Thomas Carlyle undoubtedly rediscovered for Englishmen the revolution
that was at the back of all their policies and reforms. It is an
entertaining side joke that the French Revolution should have been
discovered for Britons by the only British writer who did not really
believe in it. Nevertheless, the most authoritative and the most recent
critics on that great renaissance agree in considering Carlyle&rsquo;s
work one of the most searching and detailed power. Carlyle had read a
great deal about the French Revolution. Dickens had read nothing at all,
except Carlyle. Carlyle was a man who collected his ideas by the careful
collation of documents and the verification of references. Dickens was a
man who collected his ideas from loose hints in the streets, and those
always the same streets; as I have said, he was the citizen of one city.
Carlyle was in his <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
way learned; Dickens was in every way ignorant. Dickens was an
Englishman cut off from France; Carlyle was a Scotsman, historically
connected with France. And yet, when all this is said and certified,
Dickens is more right than Carlyle. Dickens&rsquo;s French Revolution is
probably more like the real French Revolution than Carlyle&rsquo;s. It
is difficult, if not impossible, to state the grounds of this strong
conviction. One can only talk of it by employing that excellent method
which Cardinal Newman employed when he spoke of the &ldquo;notes&rdquo;
of Catholicism. There were certain &ldquo;notes&rdquo; of the
Revolution. One note of the Revolution was the thing which silly people
call optimism, and sensible people call high spirits. Carlyle could
never quite get it, because with all his spiritual energy he had no high
spirits. That is why he preferred prose to poetry. He could understand
rhetoric; for rhetoric means singing with an object. But he could not
understand lyrics; for the lyric means singing without an object; as
every one does when he is happy. Now for all its blood and its black
guillotines, the French Revolution was full of mere high spirits. Nay,
it was full of happiness. This actual lilt and levity Carlyle never
really found in the Revolution, because he could not find it in himself.
Dickens knew less of the Revolution, but he had more of it. When Dickens
attacked abuses, he battered them down with exactly that sort of cheery
and quite one-sided satisfaction with which the French mob battered down
the Bastille. Dickens utterly and innocently believed in certain things;
he would, I think, have drawn the sword for them. Carlyle half believed
in half a hundred things; he was at <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
once more of a mystic and more of a sceptic. Carlyle was the perfect
type of the grumbling servant; the old grumbling servant of the
aristocratic comedies. He followed the aristocracy, but he growled as he
followed. He was obedient without being servile, just as Caleb
Balderstone was obedient without being servile. But Dickens was the type
of the man who might really have rebelled instead of grumbling. He might
have gone out into the street and fought, like the man who took the
Bastille. It is somewhat nationally significant that when we talk of the
man in the street it means a figure silent, slouching, and even feeble.
When the French speak of the man in the street, it means danger in the
street.</p>

<p>No one can fail to notice this deep difference between Dickens and the
Carlyle whom he avowedly copied. Splendid and symbolic as are
Carlyle&rsquo;s scenes of the French Revolution, we have in reading them
a curious sense that everything is happening at night. In Dickens even
massacre happens by daylight. Carlyle always assumes that because things
were tragedies therefore the men who did them felt tragic. Dickens knows
that the man who works the worst tragedies is the man who feels comic;
as for example, Mr. Quilp. The French Revolution was a much simpler
world than Carlyle could understand; for Carlyle was subtle and not
simple. Dickens could understand it, for he was simple and not subtle.
He understood that plain rage against plain political injustice; he
understood again that obvious vindictiveness and that obvious brutality
which followed. &ldquo;Cruelty and the abuse of absolute power,&rdquo;
he told an American slave-owner, &ldquo;are two of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
the bad passions of human nature.&rdquo; Carlyle was quite incapable of
rising to the height of that uplifted common-sense. He must always find
something mystical about the cruelty of the French Revolution. The
effect was equally bad whether he found it mystically bad and called the
thing anarchy, or whether he found it mystically good and called it the
rule of the strong. In both cases he could not understand the
common-sense justice or the common-sense vengeance of Dickens and the
French Revolution.</p>

<p>Yet Dickens has in this book given a perfect and final touch to this
whole conception of mere rebellion and mere human nature. Carlyle had
written the story of the French Revolution and had made the story a mere
tragedy. Dickens writes the story about the French Revolution, and does
not make the Revolution itself the tragedy at all. Dickens knows that an
outbreak is seldom a tragedy; generally it is the avoidance of a
tragedy. All the real tragedies are silent. Men fight each other with
furious cries, because men fight each other with chivalry and an
unchangeable sense of brotherhood. But trees fight each other in utter
stillness; because they fight each other cruelly and without quarter. In
this book, as in history, the guillotine is not the calamity, but rather
the solution of the calamity. The sin of Sydney Carton is a sin of
habit, not of revolution. His gloom is the gloom of London, not the
gloom of Paris.</p>

<h2><a name="EXPECTATIONS" id="EXPECTATIONS"></a>GREAT EXPECTATIONS</h2>

<p><i>Great Expectations</i>, which was written in the afternoon of
Dickens&rsquo;s life and fame, has a quality of serene irony and even
sadness, which puts it quite alone among his other works. At no time
could Dickens possibly be called cynical, he had too much vitality; but
relatively to the other books this book is cynical; but it has the soft
and gentle cynicism of old age, not the hard cynicism of youth. To be a
young cynic is to be a young brute; but Dickens, who had been so
perfectly romantic and sentimental in his youth, could afford to admit
this touch of doubt into the mixed experience of his middle age. At no
time could any books by Dickens have been called Thackerayan. Both of
the two men were too great for that. But relatively to the other
Dickensian productions this book may be called Thackerayan. It is a
study in human weakness and the slow human surrender. It describes how
easily a free lad of fresh and decent instincts can be made to care more
for rank and pride and the degrees of our stratified society than for
old affection and for honour. It is an extra chapter to <i>The Book of
Snobs</i>.</p>

<p>The best way of stating the change which this book marks in Dickens can
be put in one phrase. In this book for the first time the hero
disappears. The hero had descended to Dickens by a long line which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
begins with the gods, nay, perhaps if one may say so, which begins with
God. First comes Deity and then the image of Deity; first comes the god
and then the demi-god, the Hercules who labours and conquers before he
receives his heavenly crown. That idea, with continual mystery and
modification, has continued behind all romantic tales; the demi-god
became the hero of paganism; the hero of paganism became the
knight-errant of Christianity; the knight-errant who wandered and was
foiled before he triumphed became the hero of the later prose romance,
the romance in which the hero had to fight a duel with the villain but
always survived, in which the hero drove desperate horses through the
night in order to rescue the heroine, but always rescued her.</p>

<p>This heroic modern hero, this demi-god in a top-hat, may be said to
reach his supreme moment and typical example about the time when Dickens
was writing that thundering and thrilling and highly unlikely scene in
<i>Nicholas Nickleby</i>, the scene where Nicholas hopelessly denounces the
atrocious Gride in his hour of grinning triumph, and a thud upon the
floor above tells them that the heroine&rsquo;s tyrannical father has
died just in time to set her free. That is the apotheosis of the pure
heroic as Dickens found it, and as Dickens in some sense continued it.
It may be that it does not appear with quite so much unmistakable youth,
beauty, valour, and virtue as it does in Nicholas Nickleby. Walter Gay
is a simpler and more careless hero, but when he is doing any of the
business of the story he is purely heroic. Kit Nubbles is a humbler
hero, but he is a hero; when he is good he is very good. Even
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
David Copperfield, who confesses to boyish tremors and boyish
evasions in his account of his boyhood, acts the strict stiff part of
the chivalrous gentleman in all the active and determining scenes of the
tale. But <i>Great Expectations</i> may be called, like <i>Vanity Fair</i>, a
novel without a hero. Almost all Thackeray&rsquo;s novels except Esmond
are novels without a hero, but only one of Dickens&rsquo;s novels can be
so described. I do not mean that it is a novel without a <i>jeune
premier</i>, a young man to make love; <i>Pickwick</i> is that and <i>Oliver
Twist</i>, and, perhaps, <i>The Old Curiosity Shop</i>. I mean that it is a
novel without a hero in the same far deeper and more deadly sense in
which <i>Pendennis</i> is also a novel without a hero. I mean that it is a
novel which aims chiefly at showing that the hero is unheroic.</p>

<p>All such phrases as these must appear of course to overstate the case.
Pip is a much more delightful person than Nicholas Nickleby. Or to take
a stronger case for the purpose of our argument, Pip is a much more
delightful person than Sydney Carton. Still the fact remains. Most of
Nicholas Nickleby&rsquo;s personal actions are meant to show that he is
heroic. Most of Pip&rsquo;s actions are meant to show that he is not
heroic. The study of Sydney Carton is meant to indicate that with all
his vices Sydney Carton was a hero. The study of Pip is meant to
indicate that with all his virtues Pip was a snob. The motive of the
literary explanation is different. Pip and Pendennis are meant to show
how circumstances can corrupt men. Sam Weller and Hercules are meant to
show how heroes can subdue circumstances.</p>

<p>This is the preliminary view of the book which is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
necessary if we are to regard it as a real and separate fact in the
life of Dickens. Dickens had many moods because he was an artist; but he
had one great mood, because he was a great artist. Any real difference
therefore from the general drift, or rather (I apologise to Dickens) the
general drive of his creation is very important. This is the one place
in his work in which he does, I will not say feel like Thackeray, far
less think like Thackeray, less still write like Thackeray, but this is
the one of his works in which he understands Thackeray. He puts himself
in some sense in the same place; he considers mankind at somewhat the
same angle as mankind is considered in one of the sociable and sarcastic
novels of Thackeray. When he deals with Pip he sets out not to show his
strength like the strength of Hercules, but to show his weakness like
the weakness of Pendennis. When he sets out to describe Pip&rsquo;s
great expectation he does not set out, as in a fairytale, with the idea
that these great expectations will be fulfilled; he sets out from the
first with the idea that these great expectations will be disappointing.
We might very well, as I have remarked elsewhere, apply to all
Dickens&rsquo;s books the title <i>Great Expectations</i>. All his books are
full of an airy and yet ardent expectation of everything; of the next
person who shall happen to speak, of the next chimney that shall happen
to smoke, of the next event, of the next ecstasy; of the next fulfilment
of any eager human fancy. All his books might be called <i>Great
Expectations</i>. But the only book to which he gave the name of <i>Great
Expectations</i> was the only book in which the expectation was never
realised. It was so with the whole of that splendid and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
unconscious generation to which he belonged. The whole glory of that
old English middle class was that it was unconscious; its excellence was
entirely in that, that it was the culture of the nation, and that it did
not know it. If Dickens had ever known that he was optimistic, he would
have ceased to be happy.</p>

<p>It is necessary to make this first point clear: that in <i>Great
Expectations</i> Dickens was really trying to be a quiet, a detached, and
even a cynical observer of human life. Dickens was trying to be
Thackeray. And the final and startling triumph of Dickens is this: that
even to this moderate and modern story, he gives an incomparable energy
which is not moderate and which is not modern. He is trying to be
reasonable; but in spite of himself he is inspired. He is trying to be
detailed, but in spite of himself he is gigantic. Compared to the rest
of Dickens this is Thackeray; but compared to the whole of Thackeray we
can only say in supreme praise of it that it is Dickens.</p>

<p>Take, for example, the one question of snobbishness. Dickens has
achieved admirably the description of the doubts and vanities of the
wretched Pip as he walks down the street in his new gentlemanly clothes,
the clothes of which he is so proud and so ashamed. Nothing could be so
exquisitely human, nothing especially could be so exquisitely masculine
as that combination of self-love and self-assertion and even insolence
with a naked and helpless sensibility to the slightest breath of
ridicule. Pip thinks himself better than every one else, and yet anybody
can snub him; that is the everlasting male, and perhaps the everlasting
gentleman. Dickens has described perfectly this <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
quivering and defenceless dignity. Dickens has described perfectly how
ill-armed it is against the coarse humour of real humanity&mdash;the
real humanity which Dickens loved, but which idealists and
philanthropists do not love, the humanity of cabmen and costermongers
and men singing in a third-class carriage; the humanity of Trabb&rsquo;s
boy. In describing Pip&rsquo;s weakness Dickens is as true and as
delicate as Thackeray. But Thackeray might have been easily as true and
as delicate as Dickens. This quick and quiet eye for the tremors of
mankind is a thing which Dickens possessed, but which others possessed
also. George Eliot or Thackeray could have described the weakness of
Pip. Exactly what George Eliot and Thackeray could not have described
was the vigour of Trabb&rsquo;s boy. There would have been admirable
humour and observation in their accounts of that intolerable urchin.
Thackeray would have given us little light touches of Trabb&rsquo;s boy,
absolutely true to the quality and colour of the humour, just as in his
novels of the eighteenth century, the glimpses of Steele or Bolingbroke
or Doctor Johnson are exactly and perfectly true to the colour and
quality of their humour. George Eliot in her earlier books would have
given us shrewd authentic scraps of the real dialect of Trabb&rsquo;s
boy, just as she gave us shrewd and authentic scraps of the real talk in
a Midland country town. In her later books she would have given us
highly rationalistic explanations of Trabb&rsquo;s boy; which we should
not have read. But exactly what they could never have given, and exactly
what Dickens does give, is the <i>bounce</i> of Trabb&rsquo;s boy. It is the
real unconquerable rush and energy in a character which was the supreme
and quite <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
indescribable greatness of Dickens. He conquered by rushes; he attacked
in masses; he carried things at the spear point in a charge of spears;
he was the Rupert of Fiction. The thing about any figure of Dickens,
about Sam Weller or Dick Swiveller, or Micawber, or Bagstock, or
Trabb&rsquo;s boy,&mdash;the thing about each one of these persons is
that he cannot be exhausted. A Dickens character hits you first on the
nose and then in the waistcoat, and then in the eye and then in the
waistcoat again, with the blinding rapidity of some battering engine.
The scene in which Trabb&rsquo;s boy continually overtakes Pip in order
to reel and stagger as at a first encounter is a thing quite within the
real competence of such a character; it might have been suggested by
Thackeray, or George Eliot, or any realist. But the point with Dickens
is that there is a rush in the boy&rsquo;s rushings; the writer and the
reader rush with him. They start with him, they stare with him, they
stagger with him, they share an inexpressible vitality in the air which
emanates from this violent and capering satirist. Trabb&rsquo;s boy is
among other things a boy; he has a physical rapture in hurling himself
like a boomerang and in bouncing to the sky like a ball. It is just
exactly in describing this quality that Dickens is Dickens and that no
one else comes near him. No one feels in his bones that Felix Holt was
strong as he feels in his bones that little Quilp was strong. No one can
feel that even Rawdon Crawley&rsquo;s splendid smack across the face of
Lord Steyne is quite so living and life-giving as the &ldquo;kick after
kick&rdquo; which old Mr. Weller dealt the dancing and quivering
Stiggins as he drove him towards the trough. This quality, whether
expressed intellectually <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
or physically, is the profoundly popular and eternal quality in
Dickens; it is the thing that no one else could do. This quality is the
quality which has always given its continuous power and poetry to the
common people everywhere. It is life; it is the joy of life felt by
those who have nothing else but life. It is the thing that all
aristocrats have always hated and dreaded in the people. And it is the
thing which poor Pip really hates and dreads in Trabb&rsquo;s boy.</p>

<p>A great man of letters or any great artist is symbolic without knowing
it. The things he describes are types because they are truths.
Shakespeare may, or may not, have ever put it to himself that Richard
the Second was a philosophical symbol; but all good criticism must
necessarily see him so. It may be a reasonable question whether the
artist should be allegorical. There can be no doubt among sane men that
the critic should be allegorical. Spenser may have lost by being less
realistic than Fielding. But any good criticism of <i>Tom Jones</i> must be
as mystical as the <i>Faery Queen</i>. Hence it is unavoidable in speaking of
a fine book like <i>Great Expectations</i> that we should give even to its
unpretentious and realistic figures a certain massive mysticism. Pip is
Pip, but he is also the well-meaning snob. And this is even more true of
those two great figures in the tale which stand for the English
democracy. For, indeed, the first and last word upon the English
democracy is said in Joe Gargery and Trabb&rsquo;s boy. The actual
English populace, as distinct from the French populace or the Scotch or
Irish populace, may be said to lie between those two types. The first is
the poor man who does not assert <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
himself at all, and the second is the poor man who asserts himself
entirely with the weapon of sarcasm. The only way in which the English
now ever rise in revolution is under the symbol and leadership of
Trabb&rsquo;s boy. What pikes and shillelahs were to the Irish populace,
what guns and barricades were to the French populace, that chaff is to
the English populace. It is their weapon, the use of which they really
understand. It is the one way in which they can make a rich man feel
uncomfortable, and they use it very justifiably for all it is worth. If
they do not cut off the heads of tyrants at least they sometimes do
their best to make the tyrants lose their heads. The gutter boys of the
great towns carry the art of personal criticism to so rich and delicate
a degree that some well-dressed persons when they walk past a file of
them feel as if they were walking past a row of omniscient critics or
judges with a power of life and death. Here and there only is some
ordinary human custom, some natural human pleasure suppressed in
deference to the fastidiousness of the rich. But all the rich tremble
before the fastidiousness of the poor.</p>

<p>Of the other type of democracy it is far more difficult to speak. It is
always hard to speak of good things or good people, for in satisfying
the soul they take away a certain spur to speech. Dickens was often
called a sentimentalist. In one sense he sometimes was a sentimentalist.
But if sentimentalism be held to mean something artificial or
theatrical, then in the core and reality of his character Dickens was
the very reverse of a sentimentalist. He seriously and definitely loved
goodness. To see sincerity and charity satisfied <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
him like a meal. What some critics call his love of sweet stuff is
really his love of plain beef and bread. Sometimes one is tempted to
wish that in the long Dickens dinner the sweet courses could be left
out; but this does not make the whole banquet other than a banquet
singularly solid and simple. The critics complain of the sweet things,
but not because they are so strong as to like simple things. They
complain of the sweet things because they are so sophisticated as to
like sour things; their tongues are tainted with the bitterness of
absinthe. Yet because of the very simplicity of Dickens&rsquo;s moral
tastes it is impossible to speak adequately of them; and Joe Gargery
must stand as he stands in the book, a thing too obvious to be
understood. But this may be said of him in one of his minor aspects,
that he stands for a certain long-suffering in the English poor, a
certain weary patience and politeness which almost breaks the heart. One
cannot help wondering whether that great mass of silent virtue will ever
achieve anything on this earth.</p>

<h2><a name="MUTUAL" id="MUTUAL"></a>OUR MUTUAL FRIEND</h2>

<p><i>Our Mutual Friend</i> marks a happy return to the earlier manner of
Dickens at the end of Dickens&rsquo;s life. One might call it a sort of
Indian summer of his farce. Those who most truly love Dickens love the
earlier Dickens; and any return to his farce must be welcomed, like a
young man come back from the dead. In this book indeed he does not
merely return to his farce; he returns in a manner to his vulgarity. It
is the old democratic and even uneducated Dickens who is writing here.
The very title is illiterate. Any priggish pupil teacher could tell
Dickens that there is no such phrase in English as &ldquo;our mutual
friend.&rdquo; Any one could tell Dickens that &ldquo;our mutual
friend&rdquo; means &ldquo;our reciprocal friend,&rdquo; and that
&ldquo;our reciprocal friend&rdquo; means nothing. If he had only had
all the solemn advantages of academic learning (the absence of which in
him was lamented by the <i>Quarterly Review</i>), he would have known better.
He would have known that the correct phrase for a man known to two
people is &ldquo;our common friend.&rdquo; But if one calls one&rsquo;s
friend a common friend, even that phrase is open to misunderstanding.</p>

<p>I dwell with a gloomy pleasure on this mistake in the very title of the
book because I, for one, am not pleased to see Dickens gradually
absorbed by modern culture and good manners. Dickens, by class and
genius, belonged to the kind of people who do talk about a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
&ldquo;mutual friend&rdquo;; and for that class there is a very great
deal to be said. These two things can at least be said&mdash;that this class
does understand the meaning of the word &ldquo;friend&rdquo; and the
meaning of the word &ldquo;mutual.&rdquo; I know that for some long time
before he had been slowly and subtly sucked into the whirlpool of the
fashionable views of later England. I know that in <i>Bleak House</i> he
treats the aristocracy far more tenderly than he treats them in <i>David
Copperfield</i>. I know that in <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i>, having come under
the influence of Carlyle, he treats revolution as strange and weird,
whereas under the influence of Cobbett he would have treated it as
obvious and reasonable. I know that in <i>The Mystery of Edwin Drood</i> he
not only praised the Minor Canon of Cloisterham at the expense of the
dissenting demagogue, Honeythunder; I know that he even took the last
and most disastrous step in the modern English reaction. While blaming
the old Cloisterham monks (who were democratic), he praised the
old-world peace that they had left behind them&mdash;an old-world peace which
is simply one of the last amusements of aristocracy. The modern rich
feel quite at home with the dead monks. They would have felt anything
but comfortable with the live ones. I know, in short, how the simple
democracy of Dickens was gradually dimmed by the decay and reaction of
the middle of the nineteenth century. I know that he fell into some of
the bad habits of aristocratic sentimentalism. I know that he used the
word &ldquo;gentleman&rdquo; as meaning good man. But all this only adds
to the unholy joy with which I realise that the very title of one of his
best books was a vulgarism. It <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
is pleasant to contemplate this last unconscious knock in the eye for
the gentility with which Dickens was half impressed. Dickens is the old
self-made man; you may take him or leave him. He has its disadvantages
and its merits. No university man would have written the title; no
university man could have written the book.</p>

<p>If it were a mere matter of the accident of a name it would not be worth
while thus to dwell on it, even as a preface. But the title is in this
respect typical of the tale. The novel called <i>Our Mutual Friend</i> is in
many ways a real reaction towards the earlier Dickens manner. I have
remarked that <i>Little Dorrit</i> was a reversion to the form of the first
books, but not to their spirit; <i>Our Mutual Friend</i> is a reversion to
the spirit as well as the form. Compare, for instance, the public
figures that make a background in each book. Mr. Merdle is a commercial
man having no great connection with the plot; similarly Mr. Podsnap is a
commercial man having no great connection with the plot. This is
altogether in the spirit of the earlier books; the whole point of an
early Dickens novel was to have as many people as possible entirely
unconnected with the plot. But exactly because both studies are
irrelevant, the contrast between them can be more clearly perceived.
Dickens goes out of his way to describe Merdle; and it is a gloomy
description. But Dickens goes out of his way to describe Podsnap, and it
is a happy and hilarious description. It recalls the days when he hunted
great game; when he went out of his way to entrap such adorable monsters
as Mr. Pecksniff or Mr. Vincent Crummles. With these wild beings we
never bother about the cause of their coming. Such guests in a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>\
story may be uninvited, but they are never <i>de trop</i>. They earn their
night&rsquo;s lodging in any tale by being so uproariously amusing; like
little Tommy Tucker in the legend, they sing for their supper. This is
really the marked truth about <i>Our Mutual Friend</i>, as a stage in the
singular latter career of Dickens. It is like the leaping up and flaming
of a slowly dying fire. The best things in the book are in the old best
manner of the author. They have that great Dickens quality of being
something which is pure farce and yet which is not superficial; an
unfathomable farce&mdash;a farce that goes down to the roots of the
universe. The highest compliment that can ever be paid to the humour of
Dickens is paid when some lady says, with the sudden sincerity of her
sex, that it is &ldquo;too silly.&rdquo; The phrase is really a
perfectly sound and acute criticism. Humour does consist in being too
silly, in passing the borderland, in breaking through the floor of sense
and falling into some starry abyss of nonsense far below our ordinary
human life. This &ldquo;too silly&rdquo; quality is really present in
<i>Our Mutual Friend</i>. It is present in <i>Our Mutual Friend</i> just as it is
present in <i>Pickwick</i>, or <i>Martin Chuzzlewit</i>; just as it is not present
in <i>Little Dorrit</i> or in <i>Hard Times</i>. Many tests might be employed. One
is the pleasure in purely physical jokes&mdash;jokes about the body. The
general dislike which every one felt for Mr. Stiggins&rsquo;s nose is of
the same kind as the ardent desire which Mr. Lammle felt for Mr.
Fledgeby&rsquo;s nose. &ldquo;Give me your nose, Sir,&rdquo; said Mr.
Lammle. That sentence alone would be enough to show that the young
Dickens had never died.</p>

<p>The opening of a book goes for a great deal. The <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
opening of <i>Our Mutual Friend</i> is much more instinctively energetic and
light-hearted than that of any of the other novels of his concluding
period. Dickens had always enough optimism to make his stories end well.
He had not, in his later years, always enough optimism to make them
begin well. Even <i>Great Expectations</i>, the saddest of his later books,
ends well; it ends well in spite of himself, who had intended it to end
badly. But if we leave the evident case of good endings and take the
case of good beginnings, we see how much <i>Our Mutual Friend</i> stands out
from among the other novels of the evening or the end of Dickens. The
tale of <i>Little Dorrit</i> begins in a prison. One of the prisoners is a
villain, and his villainy is as dreary as the prison; that might matter
nothing. But the other prisoner is vivacious, and even his vivacity is
dreary. The first note struck is sad. In the tale of <i>Edwin Drood</i> the
first scene is in an opium den, suffocated with every sort of phantasy
and falsehood. Nor is it true that these openings are merely accidental;
they really cast their shadow over the tales. The people of <i>Little
Dorrit</i> begin in prison; and it is the whole point of the book that
people never get out of prison. The story of <i>Edwin Drood</i> begins amid
the fumes of opium, and it never gets out of the fumes of opium. The
darkness of that strange and horrible smoke is deliberately rolled over
the whole story. Dickens, in his later years, permitted more and more
his story to take the cue from its inception. All the more remarkable,
therefore, is the real jerk and spurt of good spirits with which he
opens <i>Our Mutual Friend</i>. It begins with a good piece of rowdy satire,
wildly exaggerated and extremely true.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
It belongs to the same class as the first chapter of <i>Martin
Chuzzlewit</i>, with its preposterous pedigree of the Chuzzlewit family, or
even the first chapter of <i>Pickwick</i>, with its immortal imbecilities
about the Theory of Tittlebats and Mr. Blotton of Aldgate. Doubtless the
early satiric chapter in <i>Our Mutual Friend</i> is of a more strategic and
ingenious kind of satire than can be found in these early and explosive
parodies. Still, there is a quality common to both, and that quality is
the whole of Dickens. It is a quality difficult to define&mdash;hence
the whole difficulty of criticising Dickens. Perhaps it can be best
stated in two separate statements or as two separate symptoms. The first
is the mere fact that the reader rushes to read it. The second is the
mere fact that the writer rushed to write it.</p>

<p>This beginning, which is like a burst of the old exuberant Dickens, is,
of course, the Veneering dinner-party. In its own way it is as good as
anything that Dickens ever did. There is the old faculty of managing a
crowd, of making character clash with character, that had made Dickens
not only the democrat but even the demagogue of fiction. For if it is
hard to manage a mob, it is hardest of all to manage a swell mob. The
particular kind of chaos that is created by the hospitality of a rich
upstart has perhaps never been so accurately and outrageously described.
Every touch about the thing is true; to this day any one can test it if
he goes to a dinner of this particular kind. How admirable, for
instance, is the description of the way in which all the guests ignored
the host; how the host and hostess peered and gaped for some stray
attention as if they had been a pair of poor relations. Again, how well,
as a matter <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
of social colour, the distinctions between the type and tone of the
guests are made even in the matter of this unguestlike insolence. How
well Dickens distinguishes the ill-bred indifference of Podsnap from the
well-bred indifference of Mortimer Lightwood and Eugene Wrayburn. How
well he distinguishes the bad manners of the merchant from the equally
typical bad manners of the gentleman. Above all, how well he catches the
character of the creature who is really the master of all these: the
impenetrable male servant. Nowhere in literature is the truth about
servants better told. For that truth is simply this: that the secret of
aristocracy is hidden even from aristocrats. Servants, butlers, footmen,
are the high priests who have the real dispensation; and even gentlemen
are afraid of them. Dickens was never more right than when he made the
new people, the Veneerings, employ a butler who despised not only them
but all their guests and acquaintances. The admirable person called the
Analytical Chemist shows his perfection particularly in the fact that he
regards all the sham gentlemen and all the real gentlemen with the same
gloomy and incurable contempt. He offers wine to the offensive Podsnap
or the shrieking Tippins with a melancholy sincerity and silence; but he
offers his letter to the aristocratic and unconscious Mortimer with the
same sincerity and with the same silence. It is a great pity that the
Analytical Chemist only occurs in two or three scenes of this excellent
story. As far as I know, he never really says a word from one end of the
book to the other; but he is one of the best characters in Dickens.</p>

<p>Round the Veneering dinner-table are collected not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
indeed the best characters in Dickens, but certainly the best
characters in <i>Our Mutual Friend</i>. Certainly one exception must be made.
Fledgeby is unaccountably absent. There was really no reason why he
should not have been present at a dinner-party given by the Veneerings
and including the Lammles. His money was at least more genuine than
theirs. If he had been present the party would really have included all
that is important in <i>Our Mutual Friend</i>. For indeed, outside Mr.
Fledgeby and the people at the dinner-party, there is something a little
heavy and careless about the story. Mr. Silas Wegg is really funny; and
he serves the purpose of a necessary villain in the plot. But his humour
and his villainy seem to have no particular connection with each other;
when he is not scheming he seems the last man likely to scheme. He is
rather like one of Dickens&rsquo;s agreeable Bohemians, a pleasant
companion, a quoter of fine verses. His villainy seems an artificial
thing attached to him, like his wooden leg. For while his villainy is
supposed to be of a dull, mean, and bitter sort (quite unlike, for
instance, the uproarious villainy of Quilp), his humour is of the
sincere, flowing and lyric character, like that of Dick Swiveller or Mr.
Micawber. He tells Mr. Boffin that he will drop into poetry in a
friendly way. He does drop into it in a friendly way; in much too really
a friendly way to make him convincing as a mere calculating knave. He
and Mr. Venus are such natural and genuine companions that one does not
see why if Venus repents Wegg should not repent too. In short, Wegg is a
convenience for a plot and not a very good plot at that. But if he is
one of the blots on the business, he is not the principal
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
one. If the real degradation of Wegg is not very convincing, it is at
least immeasurably more convincing than the pretended degradation of
Boffin. The passage in which Boffin appears as a sort of miser, and then
afterwards explains that he only assumed the character for reasons of
his own, has something about it highly jerky and unsatisfactory. The
truth of the whole matter I think, almost certainly, is that Dickens did
not originally mean Boffin&rsquo;s lapse to be fictitious. He originally
meant Boffin really to be corrupted by wealth, slowly to degenerate and
as slowly to repent. But the story went too quickly for this long,
double, and difficult process; therefore Dickens at the last moment made
a sudden recovery possible by representing that the whole business had
been a trick. Consequently, this episode is not an error merely in the
sense that we may find many errors in a great writer like Dickens; it is
a mistake patched up with another mistake. It is a case of that
ossification which occurs round the healing of an actual fracture; the
story had broken down and been mended.</p>

<p>If Dickens had fulfilled what was probably his original design, and
described the slow freezing of Boffin&rsquo;s soul in prosperity, I do
not say that he would have done the thing well. He was not good at
describing change in anybody, especially not good at describing a change
for the worse. The tendency of all his characters is upwards, like
bubbles, never downwards, like stones. But at least it would probably
have been more credible than the story as it stands; for the story as it
stands is actually less credible than any conceivable kind of moral ruin
for Boffin. Such a character as his&mdash;rough, simple and lumberingly
unconscious&mdash;might be more <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
easily conceived as really sinking in self-respect and honour than as
keeping up, month after month, so strained and inhuman a theatrical
performance. To a good man (of that particular type) it would be easier
to be bad than to pretend to be bad. It might have taken years to turn
Noddy Boffin into a miser; but it would have taken centuries to turn him
into an actor. This unreality in the later Boffin scenes makes the end
of the story of John Harmon somewhat more unimpressive perhaps than it
might otherwise have been. Upon no hypothesis, however, can he be made
one of the more impressive figures of Dickens. It is true that it is an
unfair criticism to object, as some have done, that Dickens does not
succeed in disguising the identity of John Harmon with John Rokesmith.
Dickens never intended to disguise it; the whole story would be mainly
unintelligible and largely uninteresting if it had been successfully
disguised. But though John Harmon or Rokesmith was never intended to be
merely a man of mystery, it is not quite so easy to say what he was
intended to be. Bella is a possible and pretty sketch. Mrs. Wilfer, her
mother, is an entirely impossible and entirely delightful one. Miss
Podsnap is not only excellent, she is to a healthy taste positively
attractive; there is a real suggestion in her of the fact that humility
is akin to truth, even when humility takes its more comic form of
shyness. There is not in all literature a more human <i>cri de c&oelig;ur</i> than
that with which Georgiana Podsnap receives the information that a young
man has professed himself to be attracted by her&mdash;&ldquo;Oh what a
Fool he must be!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Two other figures require praise, though they are in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
the more tragic manner which Dickens touched from time to time in his
later period. Bradley Headstone is really a successful villain; so
successful that he fully captures our sympathies. Also there is
something original in the very conception. It was a new notion to add to
the villains of fiction, whose thoughts go quickly, this villain whose
thoughts go slow but sure; and it was a new notion to combine a deadly
criminality not with high life or the slums (the usual haunts for
villains) but with the laborious respectability of the lower, middle
classes. The other good conception is the boy, Bradley Headstone&rsquo;s
pupil, with his dull, inexhaustible egoism, his pert, unconscious
cruelty, and the strict decorum and incredible baseness of his views of
life. It is singular that Dickens, who was not only a radical and a
social reformer, but one who would have been particularly concerned to
maintain the principle of modern popular education, should nevertheless
have seen so clearly this potential evil in the mere educationalism of
our time&mdash;the fact that merely educating the democracy may easily
mean setting to work to despoil it of all the democratic virtues. It is
better to be Lizzie Hexam and not know how to read and write than to be
Charlie Hexam and not know how to appreciate Lizzie Hexam. It is not
only necessary that the democracy should be taught; it is also necessary
that the democracy should be taught democracy. Otherwise it will
certainly fall a victim to that snobbishness and system of worldly
standards which is the most natural and easy of all the forms of human
corruption. This is one of the many dangers which Dickens saw before it
existed. Dickens was really a prophet; far more of a prophet than
Carlyle.</p>

<h2><a name="DROOD" id="DROOD"></a>EDWIN DROOD</h2>

<p><i>Pickwick</i> was a work partly designed by others, but ultimately filled
up by Dickens. <i>Edwin Drood</i>, the last book, was a book designed by
Dickens, but ultimately filled up by others. The <i>Pickwick Papers</i>
showed how much Dickens could make out of other people&rsquo;s
suggestions; <i>The Mystery of Edwin Drood</i> shows how very little other
people can make out of Dickens&rsquo;s suggestions.</p>

<p>Dickens was meant by Heaven to be the great melodramatist; so that even
his literary end was melodramatic. Something more seems hinted at in the
cutting short of <i>Edwin Drood</i> by Dickens than the mere cutting short of
a good novel by a great man. It seems rather like the last taunt of some
elf, leaving the world, that it should be this story which is not ended,
this story which is only a story. The only one of Dickens&rsquo;s novels
which he did not finish was the only one that really needed finishing.
He never had but one thoroughly good plot to tell; and that he has only
told in heaven. This is what separates the case in question from any
parallel cases of novelists cut off in the act of creation. That great
novelist, for instance, with whom Dickens is constantly compared, died
also in the middle of <i>Denis Duval</i>. But any one can see in <i>Denis
Duval</i> the qualities of the later work of Thackeray; the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
increasing discursiveness, the increasing retrospective poetry, which
had been in part the charm and in part the failure of <i>Philip</i> and <i>The
Virginians</i>. But to Dickens it was permitted to die at a dramatic moment
and to leave a dramatic mystery. Any Thackerayan could have completed
the plot of <i>Denis Duval</i>; except indeed that a really sympathetic
Thackerayan might have had some doubt as to whether there was any plot
to complete. But Dickens, having had far too little plot in his stories
previously, had far too much plot in the story he never told. Dickens
dies in the act of telling, not his tenth novel, but his first news of
murder. He drops down dead as he is in the act of denouncing the
assassin. It is permitted to Dickens, in short, to come to a literary
end as strange as his literary beginning. He began by completing the old
romance of travel. He ended by inventing the new detective story.</p>

<p>It is as a detective story first and last that we have to consider <i>The
Mystery of Edwin Drood</i>. This does not mean, of course, that the details
are not often admirable in their swift and penetrating humour; to say
that of the book would be to say that Dickens did not write it. Nothing
could be truer, for instance, than the manner in which the dazed and
drunken dignity of Durdles illustrates a certain bitterness at the
bottom of the bewilderment of the poor. Nothing could be better than the
way in which the haughty and allusive conversation between Miss
Twinkleton and the landlady illustrates the maddening preference of some
females for skating upon thin social ice. There is an even better
example than these of the original humorous insight of Dickens; and one
not very often remarked, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
because of its brevity and its unimportance in the narrative. But
Dickens never did anything better than the short account of Mr.
Grewgious&rsquo;s dinner being brought from the tavern by two waiters:
&ldquo;a stationary waiter,&rdquo; and &ldquo;a flying waiter.&rdquo;
The &ldquo;flying waiter&rdquo; brought the food and the
&ldquo;stationary waiter&rdquo; quarrelled with him; the &ldquo;flying
waiter&rdquo; brought glasses and the &ldquo;stationary waiter&rdquo;
looked through them. Finally, it will be remembered the
&ldquo;stationary waiter&rdquo; left the room, casting a glance which
indicated &ldquo;let it be understood that all emoluments are mine, and
that Nil is the reward of this slave.&rdquo; Still, Dickens wrote the
book as a detective story; he wrote it as <i>The Mystery of Edwin Drood</i>.
And alone, perhaps, among detective-story writers, he never lived to
destroy his mystery. Here alone then among the Dickens novels it is
necessary to speak of the plot and of the plot alone. And when we speak
of the plot it becomes immediately necessary to speak of the two or
three standing explanations which celebrated critics have given of the
plot.</p>

<p>The story, so far as it was written by Dickens, can be read here. It
describes, as will be seen, the disappearance of the young architect
Edwin Drood after a night of festivity which was supposed to celebrate
his reconciliation with a temporary enemy, Neville Landless, and was
held at the house of his uncle John Jasper. Dickens continued the tale
long enough to explain or explode the first and most obvious of his
riddles. Long before the existing part terminates it has become evident
that Drood has been put away, not by his obvious opponent, Landless, but
by his uncle who professes for him an almost painful affection. The fact
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
that we all know this, however, ought not in fairness to blind us to
the fact that, considered as the first fraud in a detective story, it
has been, with great skill, at once suggested and concealed. Nothing,
for instance, could be cleverer as a piece of artistic mystery than the
fact that Jasper, the uncle, always kept his eyes fixed on Drood&rsquo;s
face with a dark and watchful tenderness; the thing is so told that at
first we really take it as only indicating something morbid in the
affection; it is only afterwards that the frightful fancy breaks upon us
that it is not morbid affection but morbid antagonism. This first
mystery (which is no longer a mystery) of Jasper&rsquo;s guilt, is only
worth remarking because it shows that Dickens meant and felt himself
able to mask all his batteries with real artistic strategy and artistic
caution. The manner of the unmasking of Jasper marks the manner and tone
in which the whole tale was to be told. Here we have not got to do with
Dickens simply giving himself away, as he gave himself away in
<i>Pickwick</i> or <i>The Christmas Carol</i>. Not that one complains of his
giving himself away; there was no better gift.</p>

<p>What was the mystery of Edwin Drood from Dickens&rsquo;s point of view
we shall never know, except perhaps from Dickens in heaven, and then he
will very likely have forgotten. But the mystery of Edwin Drood from our
point of view, from that of his critics, and those who have with some
courage (after his death) attempted to be his collaborators, is simply
this. There is no doubt that Jasper either murdered Drood or supposed
that he had murdered him. This certainty we have from the fact that it
is the whole point of a scene between Jasper and Drood&rsquo;s lawyer
Grewgious <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
in which Jasper is struck down with remorse when he realises that Drood
has been killed (from his point of view) needlessly and without profit.
The only question is whether Jasper&rsquo;s remorse was as needless as
his murder. In other words the only question is whether, while he
certainly thought he had murdered Drood, he had really done it. It need
hardly be said that such a doubt would not have been raised for nothing;
gentlemen like Jasper do not as a rule waste good remorse except upon
successful crime. The origin of the doubt about the real death of Drood
is this. Towards the latter end of the existing chapters there appears
very abruptly, and with a quite ostentatious air of mystery, a character
called Datchery. He appears for the purpose of spying upon Jasper and
getting up some case against him; at any rate, if he has not this
purpose in the story he has no other earthly purpose in it. He is an old
gentleman of juvenile energy, with a habit of carrying his hat in his
hand even in the open air; which some have interpreted as meaning that
he feels the unaccustomed weight of a wig. Now there are one or two
people in the story who this person might possibly be. Notably there is
one person in the story who seems as if he were meant to be something,
but who hitherto has certainly been nothing; I mean Bazzard, Mr.
Grewgious&rsquo;s clerk, a sulky fellow interested in theatricals, of
whom an unnecessary fuss is made. There is also Mr. Grewgious himself,
and there is also another suggestion, so much more startling that I
shall have to deal with it later.</p>

<p>For the moment, however, the point is this: That ingenious writer, Mr.
Proctor, started the highly <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
plausible theory that this Datchery was Drood himself, who had not
really been killed. He adduced a most complex and complete scheme
covering nearly all the details; but the strongest argument he had was
rather one of general artistic effect. This argument has been quite
perfectly summed up by Mr. Andrew Lang in one sentence: &ldquo;If Edwin
Drood is dead, there is not much mystery about him.&rdquo; This is quite
true; Dickens, when writing in so deliberate, nay, dark and
conspiratorial a manner, would surely have kept the death of Drood and
the guilt of Jasper hidden a little longer if the only real mystery had
been the guilt of Jasper and the death of Drood. It certainly seems
artistically more likely that there was a further mystery of Edwin
Drood; not the mystery that he was murdered, but the mystery that he was
not murdered. It is true indeed that Mr. Cumming Walters has a theory of
Datchery (to which I have already darkly alluded) a theory which is wild
enough to be the centre not only of any novel but of any harlequinade.
But the point is that even Mr. Cumming Walters&rsquo;s theory, though it
makes the mystery more extraordinary, does not make it any more of a
mystery of Edwin Drood. It should not have been called <i>The Mystery of
Drood</i>, but <i>The Mystery of Datchery</i>. This is the strongest case for
Proctor; if the story tells of Drood coming back as Datchery, the story
does at any rate fulfil the title upon its title-page.</p>

<p>The principal objection to Proctor&rsquo;s theory is that there seems no
adequate reason why Jasper should not have murdered his nephew if he
wanted to. And there seems even less reason why Drood, if unsuccessfully
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
murdered, should not have raised the alarm. Happy young architects,
when nearly strangled by elderly organists, do not generally stroll away
and come back some time afterwards in a wig and with a false name.
Superficially it would seem almost as odd to find the murderer
investigating the origin of the murder, as to find the corpse
investigating it. To this problem two of the ablest literary critics of
our time, Mr. Andrew Lang and Mr. William Archer (both of them persuaded
generally of the Proctor theory) have especially addressed themselves.
Both have come to the same substantial conclusion; and I suspect that
they are right. They hold that Jasper (whose mania for opium is much
insisted on in the tale) had some sort of fit, or trance, or other
physical seizure as he was committing the crime so that he left it
unfinished; and they also hold that he had drugged Drood, so that Drood,
when he recovered from the attack, was doubtful about who had been his
assailant. This might really explain, if a little fancifully, his coming
back to the town in the character of a detective. He might think it due
to his uncle (whom he last remembered in a kind of murderous vision) to
make an independent investigation as to whether he was really guilty or
not. He might say, as Hamlet said of a vision equally terrifying,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have grounds more relative than this.&rdquo; In
fairness it must be said that there is something vaguely shaky about
this theory; chiefly, I think, in this respect; that there is a sort of
farcical cheerfulness about Datchery which does not seem altogether
appropriate to a lad who ought to be in an agony of doubt as to whether
his best friend was or was not his assassin. Still there are many such
incongruities <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
in Dickens; and the explanation of Mr. Archer and Mr. Lang is an
explanation. I do not believe that any explanation as good can be given
to account for the tale being called <i>The Mystery of Edwin Drood</i>, if
the tale practically starts with his corpse.</p>

<p>If Drood is really dead one cannot help feeling the story ought to end
where it does end, not by accident but by design. The murder is
explained. Jasper is ready to be hanged, and every one else in a decent
novel ought to be ready to be married. If there was to be much more of
anything, it must have been of anticlimax. Nevertheless there are
degrees of anticlimax. Some of the more obvious explanations of Datchery
are quite reasonable, but they are distinctly tame. For instance,
Datchery may be Bazzard; but it is not very exciting if he is; for we
know nothing about Bazzard and care less. Again, he might be Grewgious;
but there is something pointless about one grotesque character dressing
up as another grotesque character actually less amusing than himself.
Now, Mr. Cumming Walters has at least had the distinction of inventing a
theory which makes the story at least an interesting story, even if it
is not exactly the story that is promised on the cover of the book. The
obvious enemy of Drood, on whom suspicion first falls, the swarthy and
sulky Landless, has a sister even swarthier and, except for her queenly
dignity, even sulkier than he. This barbaric princess is evidently meant
to be (in a sombre way) in love with Crisparkle, the clergyman and
muscular Christian who represents the breezy element in the emotions of
the tale. Mr. Cumming Walters seriously maintains that it is this
barbaric princess <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
who puts on a wig and dresses up as Mr. Datchery. He urges his case
with much ingenuity of detail. Helena Landless certainly had a motive;
to save her brother, who was accused falsely, by accusing Jasper justly.
She certainly had some of the faculties; it is elaborately stated in the
earlier part of her story that she was accustomed as a child to dress up
in male costume and run into the wildest adventures. There may be
something in Mr. Cumming Walters&rsquo;s argument that the very
flippancy of Datchery is the self-conscious flippancy of a strong woman
in such an odd situation; certainly there is the same flippancy in
Portia and in Rosalind. Nevertheless, I think, there is one final
objection to the theory; and that is simply this, that it is comic. It
is generally wrong to represent a great master of the grotesque as being
grotesque exactly where he does not intend to be. And I am persuaded
that if Dickens had really meant Helena to turn into Datchery, he would
have made her from the first in some way more light, eccentric, and
laughable; he would have made her at least as light and laughable as
Rosa. As it is, there is something strangely stiff and incredible about
the idea of a lady so dark and dignified dressing up as a swaggering old
gentleman in a blue coat and grey trousers. We might almost as easily
imagine Edith Dombey dressing up as Major Bagstock. We might almost as
easily imagine Rebecca in <i>Ivanhoe</i> dressing up as Isaac of York.</p>

<p>Of course such a question can never really be settled precisely, because
it is the question not merely of a mystery but of a puzzle. For here the
detective novel differs from every other kind of novel. The ordinary
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
novelist desires to keep his readers to the point; the detective
novelist actually desires to keep his readers off the point. In the
first case, every touch must help to tell the reader what he means; in
the second case, most of the touches must conceal or even contradict
what he means. You are supposed to see and appreciate the smallest
gestures of a good actor; but you do not see all the gestures of a
conjuror, if he is a good conjuror. Hence, into the critical estimate of
such works as this, there is introduced a problem, an extra perplexity,
which does not exist in other cases. I mean the problem of the things
commonly called blinds. Some of the points which we pick out as
suggestive may have been put in as deceptive. Thus the whole conflict
between a critic with one theory, like Mr. Lang, and a critic with
another theory, like Mr. Cumming Walters, becomes eternal and a trifle
farcical. Mr. Walters says that all Mr. Lang&rsquo;s clues were blinds;
Mr. Lang says that all Mr. Walters&rsquo;s clues were blinds. Mr.
Walters can say that some passages seemed to show that Helena was
Datchery; Mr. Lang can reply that those passages were only meant to
deceive simple people like Mr. Walters into supposing that she was
Datchery. Similarly Mr. Lang can say that the return of Drood is
foreshadowed; and Mr. Walters can reply that it was foreshadowed because
it was never meant to come off. There seems no end to this insane
process; anything that Dickens wrote may or may not mean the opposite of
what it says. Upon this principle I should be very ready for one to
declare that all the suggested Datcherys were really blinds; merely
because they can naturally be suggested. I would undertake to maintain
that Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
Datchery is really Miss Twinkleton, who has a mercenary interest in
keeping Rosa Budd at her school. This suggestion does not seem to me to
be really much more humorous than Mr. Cumming Walters&rsquo;s theory.
Yet either may certainly be true. Dickens is dead, and a number of
splendid scenes and startling adventures have died with him. Even if we
get the right solution we shall not know that it is right. The tale
might have been, and yet it has not been.</p>

<p>And I think there is no thought so much calculated to make one doubt
death itself, to feel that sublime doubt which has created all
religion&mdash;the doubt that found death incredible. Edwin Drood may or may
not have really died; but surely Dickens did not really die. Surely our
real detective liveth and shall appear in the latter days of the earth.
For a finished tale may give a man immortality in the light and literary
sense; but an unfinished tale suggests another immortality, more
essential and more strange.</p>

<h2><a name="HUMPHREY" id="HUMPHREY"></a>MASTER HUMPHREY&rsquo;S CLOCK</h2>

<p>It is quite indispensable to include a criticism of <i>Master
Humphrey&rsquo;s Clock</i> in any survey of Dickens, although it is not one
of the books of which his admirers would chiefly boast; although perhaps
it is almost the only one of which he would not have boasted himself. As
a triumph of Dickens, at least, it is not of great importance. But as a
sample of Dickens it happens to be of quite remarkable importance. The
very fact that it is for the most part somewhat more level and even
monotonous than most of his creations, makes us realise, as it were,
against what level and monotony those creations commonly stand out. This
book is the background of his mind. It is the basis and minimum of him
which was always there. Alone, of all written things, this shows how he
felt when he was not writing. Dickens might have written it in his
sleep. That is to say, it is written by a sluggish Dickens, a half
automatic Dickens, a dreaming and drifting Dickens; but still by the
enduring Dickens.</p>

<p>But this truth can only be made evident by beginning nearer to the root
of the matter. <i>Nicholas Nickleby</i> had just completed, or, to speak more
strictly, confirmed, the popularity of the young author; wonderful as
<i>Pickwick</i> was it might have been a nine days&rsquo; wonder; <i>Oliver
Twist</i> had been powerful but painful; it was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
<i>Nicholas Nickleby</i> that proved the man to be a great productive force
of which one could ask more, of which one could ask all things. His
publishers, Chapman and Hall, seem to have taken at about this point
that step which sooner or later most publishers do take with regard to a
half successful man who is becoming wholly successful. Instead of asking
him for something, they asked him for anything. They made him, so to
speak, the editor of his own works. And indeed it is literally as the
editor of his own works that he next appears; for the next thing to
which he proposes to put his name is not a novel, but for all practical
purposes a magazine. Yet although it is a magazine, it is a magazine
entirely written by himself; the publishers, in point of fact, wanted to
create a kind of Dickens Miscellany, in a much more literal sense than
that in which we speak of a Bentley Miscellany. Dickens was in no way
disposed to dislike such a job; for the more miscellaneous he was the
more he enjoyed himself. And indeed this early experiment of his bears a
great deal of resemblance to those later experiences in which he was the
editor of two popular periodicals. The editor of <i>Master
Humphrey&rsquo;s Clock</i> was a kind of type or precursor of the editor of
<i>Household Words</i> and <i>All the Year Round</i>. There was the same sense of
absolute ease in an atmosphere of infinite gossip. There was the same
great advantage gained by a man of genius who wrote best scrappily and
by episodes. The omnipotence of the editor helped the eccentricities of
the author. He could excuse himself for all his own shortcomings. He
could begin a novel, get tired of it, and turn it into a short story. He
could begin a short <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
story, get fond of it, and turn it into a novel. Thus in the days of
<i>Household Words</i> he could begin a big scheme of stories, such as
<i>Somebody&rsquo;s Luggage</i>, or <i>Seven Poor Travellers</i>, and after
writing a tale or two toss the rest to his colleagues. Thus, on the
other hand, in the time of <i>Master Humphrey&rsquo;s Clock</i>, he could
begin one small adventure of Master Humphrey and find himself unable to
stop it. It is quite clear I think (though only from moral evidence,
which some call reading between the lines) that he originally meant to
tell many separate tales of Master Humphrey&rsquo;s wanderings in
London, only one of which, and that a short one, was to have been
concerned with a little girl going home. Fortunately for us that little
girl had a grandfather, and that grandfather had a curiosity shop and
also a nephew, and that nephew had an entirely irrelevant friend whom
men and angels called Richard Swiveller. Once having come into the
society of Swiveller it is not unnatural that Dickens stayed there for a
whole book. The essential point for us here, however, is that <i>Master
Humphrey&rsquo;s Clock</i> was stopped by the size and energy of the thing
that had come of it. It died in childbirth.</p>

<p>There is, however, another circumstance which, even in ordinary public
opinion, makes this miscellany important, besides the great novel that
came out of it. I mean that the ordinary reader can remember one great
thing about <i>Master Humphrey&rsquo;s Clock</i>, besides the fact that it
was the frame-work of <i>The Old Curiosity Shop</i>. He remembers that Mr.
Pickwick and the Wellers rise again from the dead. Dickens makes Samuel
Pickwick become a member of Master Humphrey&rsquo;s<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
Clock Society; and he institutes a parallel society in the kitchen
under the name of Mr. Weller&rsquo;s Watch.</p>

<p>Before we consider the question of whether Dickens was wise when he did
this, it is worth remarking how really odd it is that this is the only
place where he did it. Dickens, one would have thought, was the one man
who might naturally have introduced old characters into new stories.
Dickens, as a matter of fact, was almost the one man who never did it.
It would have seemed natural in him for a double reason; first, that his
characters were very valuable to him, and second that they were not very
valuable to his particular stories. They were dear to him, and they are
dear to us; but they really might as well have turned up (within reason)
in one environment as well as in another. We, I am sure, should be
delighted to meet Mr. Mantalini in the story of <i>Dombey and Son</i>. And he
certainly would not be much missed from the plot of Nicholas Nickleby.
&ldquo;I am an affectionate father,&rdquo; said Dickens, &ldquo;to all
the children of my fancy; but like many other parents I have in my heart
of hearts a favourite child; and his name is David Copperfield.&rdquo;
Yet although his heart must often have yearned backwards to the children
of his fancy whose tale was already told, yet he never touched one of
them again even with the point of his pen. The characters in <i>David
Copperfield</i>, as in all the others, were dead for him after he had done
the book; if he loved them as children, it was as dead and sanctified
children. It is a curious test of the strength and even reticence that
underlay the seeming exuberance of Dickens, that he <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
never did yield at all to exactly that indiscretion or act of
sentimentalism which would seem most natural to his emotions and his
art. Or rather he never did yield to it except here in this one case;
the case of <i>Master Humphrey&rsquo;s Clock</i>.</p>

<p>And it must be remembered that nearly everybody else did yield to it.
Especially did those writers who are commonly counted Dickens&rsquo;s
superiors in art and exactitude and closeness to connected reality.
Thackeray wallowed in it; Anthony Trollope lived on it. Those modern
artists who pride themselves most on the separation and unity of a work
of art have indulged in it often; thus, for instance, Stevenson gave a
glimpse of Alan Breck in <i>The Master of Ballantrae</i>, and meant to give a
glimpse of the Master of Ballantrae in another unwritten tale called
<i>The Rising Sun</i>. The habit of revising old characters is so strong in
Thackeray that <i>Vanity Fair</i>, <i>Pendennis</i>, <i>The Newcomes</i>, and <i>Philip</i>
are in one sense all one novel. Certainly the reader sometimes forgets
which one of them he is reading. Afterwards he cannot remember whether
the best description of Lord Steyne&rsquo;s red whiskers or Mr.
Wagg&rsquo;s rude jokes occurred in <i>Vanity Fair</i>, or <i>Pendennis</i>; he
cannot remember whether his favourite dialogue between Mr. and Mrs.
Pendennis occurred in <i>The Newcomes</i>, or in <i>Philip</i>. Whenever two
Thackeray characters in two Thackeray novels could by any possibility
have been contemporary, Thackeray delights to connect them. He makes
Major Pendennis nod to Dr. Firmin, and Colonel Newcome ask Major Dobbin
to dinner. Whenever two characters could not possibly have been
contemporary he goes out of his <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
way to make one the remote ancestor of the other. Thus he created the
great house of Warrington solely to connect a &ldquo;blue-bearded&rdquo;
Bohemian journalist with the blood of Henry Esmond. It is quite
impossible to conceive Dickens keeping up this elaborate connection
between all his characters and all his books, especially across the
ages. It would give us a kind of shock if we learnt from Dickens that
Major Bagstock was the nephew of Mr. Chester. Still less can we imagine
Dickens carrying on an almost systematic family chronicle as was in some
sense done by Trollope. There must be some reason for such a paradox;
for in itself it is a very curious one. The writers who wrote carefully
were always putting, as it were, after-words and appendices to their
already finished portraits; the man who did splendid and flamboyant but
faulty portraits never attempted to touch them up. Or rather (we may say
again) he attempted it once, and then he failed.</p>

<p>The reason lay, I think, in the very genius of Dickens&rsquo;s creation.
The child he bore of his soul quitted him when his term was passed like
a veritable child born of the body. It was independent of him, as a
child is of its parents. It had become dead to him even in becoming
alive. When Thackeray studied Pendennis or Lord Steyne he was studying
something outside himself, and therefore something that might come
nearer and nearer. But when Dickens brought forth Sam Weller or Pickwick
he was creating something that had once been inside himself and
therefore when once created could only go further and further away. It
may seem a strange thing to say of such <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
laughable characters and of so lively an author, yet I say it quite
seriously; I think it possible that there arose between Dickens and his
characters that strange and almost supernatural shyness that arises
often between parents and children; because they are too close to each
other to be open with each other. Too much hot and high emotion had gone
to the creation of one of his great figures for it to be possible for
him without embarrassment ever to speak with it again. This is the thing
which some fools call fickleness; but which is not the death of feeling,
but rather its dreadful perpetuation; this shyness is the final seal of
strong sentiment; this coldness is an eternal constancy.</p>

<p>This one case where Dickens broke through his rule was not such a
success as to tempt him in any case to try the thing again.</p>

<p>There is weakness in the strict sense of the word in this particular
reappearance of Samuel Pickwick and Samuel Weller. In the original
<i>Pickwick Papers</i> Dickens had with quite remarkable delicacy and
vividness contrived to suggest a certain fundamental sturdiness and
spirit in that corpulent and complacent old gentleman. Mr. Pickwick was
a mild man, a respectable man, a placid man; but he was very decidedly a
man. He could denounce his enemies and fight for his nightcap. He was
fat; but he had a backbone. In <i>Master Humphrey&rsquo;s Clock</i> the
backbone seems somehow to be broken; his good nature seems limp instead
of alert. He gushes out of his good heart; instead of taking a good
heart for granted as a part of any decent gentleman&rsquo;s furniture as
did the older and stronger Pickwick. The truth is, I think, that Mr.
Pickwick <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
in complete repose loses some part of the whole point of his existence.
The quality which makes the <i>Pickwick Papers</i> one of the greatest of
human fairy tales is a quality which all the great fairy tales possess,
and which marks them out from most modern writing. A modern novelist
generally endeavours to make his story interesting, by making his hero
odd. The most typical modern books are those in which the central figure
is himself or herself an exception, a cripple, a courtesan, a lunatic, a
swindler, or a person of the most perverse temperament. Such stories,
for instance, are <i>Sir Richard Calmady</i>, <i>Dodo</i>, <i>Quisante</i>, <i>La
B&ecirc;te Humaine</i>, even the <i>Egoist</i>. But in a fairy tale the boy sees
all the wonders of fairyland because he is an ordinary boy. In the same
way Mr. Samuel Pickwick sees an extraordinary England because he is an
ordinary old gentleman. He does not see things through the rosy
spectacles of the modern optimist or the green-smoked spectacles of the
pessimist; he sees it through the crystal glasses of his own innocence.
One must see the world clearly even in order to see its wildest poetry.
One must see it sanely even in order to see that it is insane.</p>

<p>Mr. Pickwick, then, relieved against a background of heavy kindliness
and quiet club life does not seem to be quite the same heroic figure as
Mr. Pickwick relieved against a background of the fighting police
constables at Ipswich or the roaring mobs of Eatanswill. Of the
degeneration of the Wellers, though it has been commonly assumed by
critics, I am not so sure. Some of the things said in the humorous
assembly round Mr. Weller&rsquo;s Watch are really human and laughable
and <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
altogether in the old manner. Especially, I think, the vague and awful
allusiveness of old Mr. Weller when he reminds his little grandson of
his delinquencies under the trope or figure of their being those of
another little boy, is really in the style both of the irony and the
domesticity of the poorer classes. Sam also says one or two things
really worthy of himself. We feel almost as if Sam were a living man,
and could not appear for an instant without being amusing.</p>

<p>The other elements in the make-up of <i>Master Humphrey&rsquo;s Clock</i>
come under the same paradox which I have applied to the whole work.
Though not very important in literature they are somehow quite important
in criticism. They show us better than anything else the whole
unconscious trend of Dickens, the stuff of which his very dreams were
made. If he had made up tales to amuse himself when half-awake (as I
have no doubt he did) they would be just such tales as these. They would
have been ghostly legends of the nooks and holes of London, echoes of
old love and laughter from the taverns or the Inns of Court. In a sense
also one may say that these tales are the great might-have-beens of
Dickens. They are chiefly designs which he fills up here slightly and
unsatisfactorily, but which he might have filled up with his own
brightest and most incredible colours. Nothing, for instance, could have
been nearer to the heart of Dickens than his great Gargantuan conception
of Gog and Magog telling London legends to each other all through the
night. Those two giants might have stood on either side of some new
great city of his invention, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
swarming with fanciful figures and noisy with new events. But as it is,
the two giants stand alone in a wilderness, guarding either side of a
gate that leads nowhere.</p>

<hr /><p class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></p>
<h2><a name="REPRINTED" id="REPRINTED"></a>REPRINTED PIECES</h2>

<p>Those abuses which are supposed to belong specially to religion belong
to all human institutions. They are not the sins of supernaturalism, but
the sins of nature. In this respect it is interesting to observe that
all the evils which our Rationalist or Protestant tradition associates
with the idolatrous veneration of sacred figures arises in the merely
human atmosphere of literature and history. Every extravagance of
hagiology can be found in hero-worship. Every folly alleged in the
worship of saints can be found in the worship of poets. There are those
who are honourably and intensely opposed to the atmosphere of religious
symbolism or religious arch&aelig;ology. There are people who have a vague
idea that the worship of saints is worse than the imitation of sinners.
There are some, like a lady I once knew, who think that hagiology is the
scientific study of hags. But these slightly prejudiced persons
generally have idolatries and superstitions of their own, particularly
idolatries and superstitions in connection with celebrated people. Mr.
Stead preserves a pistol belonging to Oliver Cromwell in the office of
the <i>Review of Reviews</i>; and I am sure he worships it in his rare
moments of solitude and leisure. A man, who could not be induced to
believe in God <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
by all the arguments of all the philosophers, professed himself ready
to believe if he could see it stated on a postcard in the handwriting of
Mr. Gladstone. Persons not otherwise noted for their religious exercise
have been known to procure and preserve portions of the hair of
Paderewski. Nay, by this time blasphemy itself is a sacred tradition,
and almost as much respect would be paid to the alleged relics of an
atheist as to the alleged relics of a god. If any one has a fork that
belonged to Voltaire, he could probably exchange it in the open market
for a knife that belonged to St. Theresa.</p>

<p>Of all the instances of this there is none stranger than the case of
Dickens. It should be pondered very carefully by those who reproach
Christianity with having been easily corrupted into a system of
superstitions. If ever there was a message full of what modern people
call true Christianity, the direct appeal to the common heart, a faith
that was simple, a hope that was infinite, and a charity that was
omnivorous, if ever there came among men what they call the Christianity
of Christ, it was in the message of Dickens. Christianity has been in
the world nearly two thousand years, and it has not yet quite lost, its
enemies being judges, its first fire and charity; but friends and
enemies would agree that it was from the very first more detailed and
doctrinal than the spirit of Dickens. The spirit of Dickens has been in
the world about sixty years; and already it is a superstition. Already
it is loaded with relics. Already it is stiff with antiquity.</p>

<p>Everything that can be said about the perversion of Christianity can be
said about the perversion of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
Dickens. It is said that Christ&rsquo;s words are repeated by the very
High Priests and Scribes whom He meant to denounce. It is just as true
that the jokes in <i>Pickwick</i> are quoted with delight by the very bigwigs
of bench and bar whom Dickens wished to make absurd and impossible. It
is said that texts from Scripture are constantly taken in vain by Judas
and Herod, by Caiaphas and Annas. It is just as true that texts from
Dickens are rapturously quoted on all our platforms by Podsnap and
Honeythunder, by Pardiggle and Veneering, by Tigg when he is forming a
company, or Pott when he is founding a newspaper. People joke about
Bumble in defence of Bumbledom; people allude playfully to Mrs. Jellyby
while agitating for Borrioboola Gha. The very things which Dickens tried
to destroy are preserved as relics of him. The very houses he wished to
pull down are propped up as monuments of Dickens. We wish to preserve
everything of him, except his perilous public spirit.</p>

<p>This antiquarian attitude towards Dickens has many manifestations, some
of them somewhat ridiculous. I give one startling instance out of a
hundred of the irony remarked upon above. In his first important book,
Dickens lashed the loathsome corruption of our oligarchical politics,
their blaring servility and dirty diplomacy of bribes, under the name of
an imaginary town called Eatanswill. If Eatanswill, wherever it was, had
been burned to the ground by its indignant neighbours the day after the
exposure, it would have been not inappropriate. If it had been entirely
deserted by its inhabitants, if they had fled to hide themselves in
holes and caverns, one could have understood <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
it. If it had been struck by a thunderbolt out of heaven or outlawed by
the whole human race, all that would seem quite natural. What has really
happened is this: that two respectable towns in Suffolk are still
disputing for the honour of having been the original Eatanswill; as if
two innocent hamlets each claimed to be Gomorrah. I make no comment; the
thing is beyond speech.</p>

<p>But this strange sentimental and relic-hunting worship of Dickens has
many more innocent manifestations. One of them is that which takes
advantage of the fact that Dickens happened to be a journalist by trade.
It occupies itself therefore with hunting through papers and magazines
for unsigned articles which may possibly be proved to be his. Only a
little time ago one of these enthusiasts ran up to me, rubbing his
hands, and told me that he was sure he had found two and a half short
paragraphs in <i>All the Year Round</i> which were certainly written by
Dickens, whom he called (I regret to say) the Master. Something of this
arch&aelig;ological weakness must cling to all mere reprints of his minor
work. He was a great novelist; but he was also, among other things, a
good journalist and a good man. It is often necessary for a good
journalist to write bad literature. It is sometimes the first duty of a
good man to write it. Pot-boilers to my feeling are sacred things; but
they may well be secret as well as sacred, like the holy pot which it is
their purpose to boil. In the collection called <i>Reprinted Pieces</i> there
are some, I think, which demand or deserve this apology. There are many
which fall below the level of his recognised books of fragments, such as
<i>The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
Sketches by Boz</i>, and <i>The Uncommercial Traveller</i>. Two or three
elements in the compilation, however, make it quite essential to any
solid appreciation of the author.</p>

<p>Of these the first in importance is that which comes last in order. I
mean the three remarkable pamphlets upon the English Sunday, called
<i>Sunday under Three Heads</i>. Here, at least, we find the eternal Dickens,
though not the eternal Dickens of fiction. His other political and
sociological suggestions in this volume are so far unimportant that they
are incidental, and even personal. Any man might have formed
Dickens&rsquo;s opinion about flogging for garrotters, and altered it
afterwards. Any one might have come to Dickens&rsquo;s conclusion about
model prisons, or to any other conclusion equally reasonable and
unimportant. These things have no colour of the great man&rsquo;s
character. But on the subject of the English Sunday he does stand for
his own philosophy. He stands for a particular view, remote at present
both from Liberals and Conservatives. He was, in a conscious sense, the
first of its spokesmen. He was in every sense the last.</p>

<p>In his appeal for the pleasures of the people, Dickens has remained
alone. The pleasures of the people have now no defender, Radical or
Tory. The Tories despise the people. The Radicals despise the pleasures.</p>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
