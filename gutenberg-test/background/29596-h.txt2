STORM STORIES.


FIRST EVENING.

How it did rain, to be sure! Up
the long street, and down the long
street nothing was to be seen but large
mud puddles, while the gutter ran like
a little river, and gushed with a loud
sound into the sewer mouth.

That was a rain indeed! but in
the warm rooms it was comfortable
enough. Books and pretty pictures
lined the walls on all sides but one,
where the large window was, the recess[8]
filled with blooming flowers; they
smelt so sweetly!

There, at a table that was covered
with a green cloth, sat a literary man.
His head was bowed upon his arms;
and when he raised his face, one saw
that he was so sad and pale! The
poor literary man was quite unhappy.

If one could have crept into his
heart (like him who owned the "Galoshes
of Fortune"), one would have
seen that his thoughts ran, "Ah me!
how unhappy I am. I write books
about the good and the beautiful, but
nobody buys them; no one cares to
read of such things. If I could but
tell them a tale, now, something lively
or pathetic, like the poet Baggesen or
our own Hoffman, that they all like.[9]
Nay, then, what a weary life it is!"
and he leaned back in his arm chair,
and closed his eyes.

Suddenly, something came hissing
down the chimney into the stove. It
was two or three rain drops driven in
by the wind. Something else appeared
to have entered with them, for there
was a rustle and breeze in the chamber,
and then the literary man heard
a whisper quite close to his ear.

"Thou silly fellow!" cried the
wind, for that it was, "to sit in thy
chamber with closed doors, waiting
for the story to come to thee! Nay,
then, what is there in thy books half
so clever or amusing as what one sees
in real life? Listen, now, and I will
tell thee what I saw one moonlight[10]
night as I blew over this wide German
land."


THE STORY OF THE WIND.

In summer, all the world       of Leipsic       goes
out of town, to Baden or
Ems. Those who can afford it run
over the Alps, to sunny Italy; but in
winter       ah! then it is very different!

One is glad enough, then, to remain
at home by the warm stove; or
if one goes out, one must be well
wrapped up in furs and cloaks.

The little boys slide and skate on
the frozen river; the poorer folks go
about in sledges, and the rich in splendid
sleighs, with white fur robes and
capering horses, which have little
bells tied to their manes and tails.[11]

Just such a sleigh as this stood, one
bright moonlight night, before the door
of the Burgomaster Von Geirstein, in
the good town of Leipsic. The whole
family were going in a body out of
town, and now the hall door opened,
and forth came the fat and stupid
Burgomaster himself, with his fat and
silly wife on his arm, followed by their
pretty, blue-eyed daughter, Matilda,
and her lover, Walther Von Blumenwald,
a thriving young merchant.
Her brother, Max, came last, a merry,
good-natured young fellow, but who,
certainly, was not very wise.

Max took the driver's place; the
others seated themselves within the
large sleigh, and tucked the warm fur
robes around them, and then, with a[12]
crack of the whip, and a loud huzzah
from the young men, the sleigh glided
swiftly away.

About five miles from the town, in
the midst of the forest, was a large inn
of the better sort, which had lately
become a favorite resort of the
wealthy who went sleighing in the
winter. Balls, even, were given there,
and there one got the most delicious
mulled wine and Westphalia hams, and
all sorts of ale, "Bremen," "Prysing,"
"Emser ale," even "Brunswick Mumme."
To this hotel, then, our party
were bound.

Merrily rang the bells, swiftly flew
the sleigh over the frozen snow, and
as they passed out at the city gates, the
whole party broke into a joyous glee:[13]


"Listen, listen, listen to the merry sleigh bells!
How they jingle, jingle, ever blithe and ever clear,
With a tintinnabulation that so musically wells
As it thrills, and it thrills upon the ear!
Every dancing little note
Seems to gurgle from the throat
Of a bird, that in its happy song so eloquently tells
The joy it is to bound
O'er the cold and frozen ground,
To the ringing and the clinging of the bells!

"Listen, listen, listen to the merry sleigh bells!
How they jingle, jingle, as the horses dash along;
What a story of our gladness their enticing music tells
As it chimes and it rhymes with the song!
Such a rollicking delight
Bubbles out upon the night
As their joy-creating burthen over hill and valley swells.
Every voice must join the tune
As we skim beneath the moon
To the tinkling and the twinkling of the bells!"


The sleigh had now turned out of
the high road, and entered the forest.[14]
For some time the way lay plain before
them, but at length came a fork,
where two roads met.

"Now, then," exclaimed Max,
"which way? Blumenwald, thou
hast been to Ol        's before       must I take
the right hand or the left?"

"Upon my word, I have forgotten!"
exclaimed Walther. "It was
a dark night when I drove out with
my cousins; but, it appears to me,
upon the whole, that we took the
right hand road."

"Well, we can only try," said
Max; "at least, if we don't get to
Ol        's, we shall have had a merry sleigh
ride."

He shook the reins, and the impatient
horses darted off; but, my stars![15]
they had taken the wrong road!
Deeper grew the wood; the roughness
of the path momentarily increased;
the trees became so thick that the
moonlight no longer penetrated them,
and Max at length stopped his horses
once more, and gazed around him in
bewilderment.

"Potstausend!" exclaimed the
Burgomaster; "where has the boy
taken us? I tell you what, mein sonne,
thou hadst best turn back, for we
shall never get to Ol        's to-night."

"And thy sister will take her death
of cold!" cried the Frau Von Geirstein,
while Walther looked anxiously
at the fair Matilda, who only smiled
up at him, and drew her fur-lined
hood more closely about her face.[16]

Just as they were about to turn
back, they heard a sound of sleigh-bells
behind, and presently a small
sleigh approached them, drawn by a
spirited horse.

Max, without more ado, hailed the
stranger, and begged him to set them,
if he could, on the road to Ol        's.

The new comer bowed courteously
to the ladies, and replied, "I shall be
most happy to direct you thither, my
respectable friends. In short, then,
you follow the road before you for a
time, then turn to your right; next,
pursue your way in a southeast direction
for a mile; next, turn toward the
northwest, and then              "

"What, sir!" interrupted Max,
"do you suppose we can go to all[17]
points of the compass at once? What
do you mean by your northwest and
southeast?"

"Potstausend! is the fellow making
fun of us?" exclaimed the Burgomaster.

"Surely the Herr Von Geirstein
cannot suppose I would be guilty of
so great an impertinence!" exclaimed
the stranger. "It is true, the road is
somewhat obscure; may I not also
have the pleasure of driving you to
Ol        's?"

"We thank you       you are most
kind," replied the mollified Burgomaster,
who never doubted for a moment
that his vast importance caused him
to be known to all the world; "but
what will become of your sledge?"[18]

"Oh, I don't fear for the sledge       that
can remain here among the underwood;
and my horse can be attached
in front of yours."

This arrangement was soon effected,
and the stranger, who was so
muffled up in fur cap and coat, that
scarcely a feature could be distinguished,
mounted beside Max, and
seized the reins.

Donnerwetter! how he shouted at
the horses! cracking his whip, and
calling them all manner of strange
names. "Now, then, pig with a
wooden head! Get along with you,
toad of serpents! To the mischief with
the whole team!" till the foam flew
on all sides, the iron-clad heels of the
steeds rang like hammer upon anvil[19]
on the frozen ground, and sparks
scintillated in the air!

Meanwhile, however, the effect of
this rapid motion on the Burgomaster's
family was anything but exhilarating.
Now that the bustle of setting
out was at an end, they one and all
began to feel afraid of their strange
guide, and to think there was something
more than common in their adventure.

"He's a very odd-looking man,
after all," whispered the Burgomaster's
wife; "how do we know what
sort of a fellow he is, and if he is taking
us to Ol        's at all? I, for my part,
believe he's in league with some robber
band, and we shall all be murdered."[20]

"Potstausend! it looks very much
like it!" exclaimed the Burgomaster,
who, although so big a man, was
mighty chicken-hearted. "I wish
Max had not been so confoundedly
hasty in accepting his advice."

"I beg thy pardon there, father-in-law,"
returned Walther; "it was
thou who bade him come in."

The Burgomaster was about to
make some peppery reply, when Max
suddenly broke upon the whispered
conversation by exclaiming:

"Since you are so good, sir, as to
drive us, perhaps you will inform us
to whom we are obliged."

But the stranger, who, before this,
had been the noisiest of the party, appeared[21]
to have become suddenly
dumb, for he answered not a word.

"Come, sir," repeated Walther,
"tell us who you are."

No answer.

Max now half jumped from his
seat, exclaiming, "But we insist on
knowing, sir, and, furthermore, I
should like to know if you are taking
us to Ol        's or not."

The stranger turned at this, and
with a smile that displayed his glittering
teeth, replied:

"My good people, I am taking
you just where you are destined to
go. As to my name, that is my affair.
Remember, your safety depends on
me; certainly, you had better not
provoke me, or              " here his speech[22]
suddenly came to an end, and a fresh
series of yells followed to the excited
horses, which all this time were tearing
along as though a troop of fiends were
in pursuit.

"It must be the Evil One himself!"
cried the Burgomaster, trembling in
every limb, while the ladies screamed
and clung together.

"Not quite so bad as that, I hope,"
said Walther, half laughing, yet excited,
and, to tell the truth, somewhat
alarmed also.

"We are all fools if we allow this
thing to go on!" shouted Max, who
had suddenly recovered his spirits.
"Walther, thou wilt stand by me.
Give me the reins, sir, or hold them
longer at your peril!"[23]

As he spoke, he endeavored to
seize the reins, while Walther stood
up in the sleigh and grasped the whip.

All at once the stranger let fall the
reins, and as they trailed on the
ground, he snatched the whip from
Walther's hand, gave a sudden leap
into the air, and vaulted on the back
of the near horse, where he sat at
ease, and drove postillion, without
their being able to help themselves.

"Alas, we have no arms!" groaned
the Burgomaster; "we may as well
be resigned to our fate. Kiss me, my
children; you may never kiss your old
papa again!"

On this, the whole quartette fell to
weeping, blowing their noses most
earnestly from time to time, when,[24]
just as their grief was at its height,
and they were fairly sobbing in each
other's arms, a sound of music broke
upon their ears! The next moment
lights gleamed through the trees, the
sleigh took a sharp turn, passed
through an open gate, and drew up
before the very door of       Ol        's! For,
in reality, both roads led to the inn,
although one was much more intricate
and less frequented than the
other.

The Von Geirsteins were for a moment
too much astounded to speak.
Then the mysterious driver, swinging
himself lightly off his horse, and doffing
his fur cap, showing them a face
not only handsome, but perfectly familiar
to them, exclaimed:[25]

"You see, my dear friends, that it
was neither a bandit nor His Satanic
Majesty who drove you by the nearest
road to a robber's castle or the lower
regions, but your very good neighbor,
Fritz Von Eisenfeldt, who has had at
once the pleasure and amusement of
taking you safe and sound to Ol        's,
after all!"

As the wind uttered these last
words, it whisked up the chimney and
disappeared. The literary man sat
upright in his chair with a sudden
start, and opened his eyes wide.

"Good heavens!" he cried, "have
I been dreaming, or has the wind
really related the tale?" He could
not at all tell this, but he remembered
every word of the story, and wrote it[26]
on       yes! this very piece of paper,
where you now read it!


SECOND EVENING.

The following evening the literary
man could not but think of the advice
of the wind. He went to the window,
and looked out on the street, to see if
there might not be a story there.

The houses opposite were as handsome
as on this side of the way, and
exactly like them; the gas lamps
burned brilliantly, and everything appeared
as genteel and stupid as could
possibly be conceived. "There's not a
story to be met with in this part of the
town," thought the literary man. "I[27]
must go out, and see if I can find one
elsewhere."

The snow flakes were rapidly falling
from the sky, but the literary man
wrapped his warm cloak around him,
and went bravely out. It is not every
one who has courage to go out in the
snow! that is, the snow at Friedrichshafen.
It is sure to be so wet and
cold, with large bits of icy hail among
it, covering the ground with a slippery
compound, that one cannot step upon
without danger of falling.

However, out he went, and slipped
and scrambled along the pavement.
Kribbedy, krabbledy, plump! down
he sat on a neighbor's doorstep; not
without exclaiming, "Potstausend!"

As he sat there with a rueful countenance,[28]
the thought passed through
his mind, "If, now, the wind would but
give me the least idea how to begin, I
might compose a tale while I wait for
a hackney coach, for walk I won't!"
and he looked up and down the street,
but no coach came in sight.

All at once it was as though a
merry voice whispered in his ear       yes,
the literary man felt sure that the
snow said to him "S-o-o! my good
friend, the wind has sent thee to me!
Fie upon thee, that thou canst not
compose a tale without help, for all
thy learning! Well, pay attention,
and I will tell thee some of the frolics
of my merry cousin, the Frost. Now,
listen."

And the literary man listened with[29]
all his ears, and quite forgot that he
was looking for a hackney coach, and
that he was sitting on the steps of his
neighbor, the Herr Hartman.


THE STORY OF THE SNOW, ABOUT CAPTAIN JACK.

The children were hurrying homeward
on a cold winter's evening, from
the forest, where they had been binding
fagots. As they scampered along,
some one seized upon them from behind
and nipped their ears sharply.
"Fie, ugly Captain Jack!" cried they;
"so thou art at work again! one may
easily see that!" and they would have
pursued their spiteful enemy; but he
was already gone, and they were now
obliged to hasten onward.[30]

Captain Jack had slipped back to
the forest, and thrown himself stealthily
on the ground, laughing to see
their discomfiture. The moon shone
on the spot where he lay, and then all
the dried grass appeared white and
sparkling, as though it were covered
with glistening spray. At one moment
one saw him lying gazing at one with
laughing eyes; the next, it seemed as
though only the hoar dew rested
there, and glittered in the moonlight.

"Bur-r-r!" growled the north wind,
as he flew through the forest. "Hollo!
Captain Jack; many thanks for
the Ice King's message which thou
broughtest me. Come, wilt thou ride
on my back in return?"[31]

"Many thanks!" replied Captain
Jack; "I prefer to travel on foot, and
amuse myself by the way."

"Well, be that as thou wilt!" replied
the wind, and he flew off in a
huff; for he considered that he had
made a very honorable offer, and had
been slighted.

But Captain Jack ran gayly from
the forest; taking long strides over
the grass, and sowing it with little
white pearls, breathing on the bare
branches of the trees, and sheathing
them in glittering mail, pouncing slyly
on stray wayfarers, and pinching their
ears and noses till they roared again!
Then Captain Jack laughed; it sounded
like the sharp crack of a pistol
through the still air.[32]

By the banks of the river hares
were creeping, and complaining bitterly
of the cold. "Ah!" said they, "if
we could but find a warm hole to
creep into, or if we had but thick,
curly coats, like the bears!"

"Do you think I have a warm
coat to give any one?" quoth Captain
Jack, and he breathed on their long
whiskers, which now stood quite
stiffly. "Oh hute-tute-tute-tu!" cried
they, hopping up and down with
pain; "oh my toes! my poor toes!"

Captain Jack also danced with
merriment; he had neither soul nor
feeling, and couldn't understand being
sorry for any one.

Over the river, the lights of the
town were gleaming. They shone like[33]
stars that had stooped a little lower
from heaven. Captain Jack skipped
lightly across the waves rolling so
softly from shore to shore, and as he
passed, the water smoothed out under
his feet; it was as though some one
had placed upon it a thin sheet of
glass.

He ran through the silent streets
of the town, where all the world had
gone to sleep, and peered in at many
casements. Sometimes he beheld the
good folks dreaming, with the hard,
ugly frown still on their faces which
they had worn when they were
awake; and then he slipped into the
room       yes, a key hole was large
enough for him to creep through if he
chose! and breathed upon them so,[34]
that they shivered in their beds, in
spite of the warm eider down they
had tucked around them. "The window
was open on a crack," they
would say on the following day; but
it needed not a crack for Captain Jack
to enter if he thought they deserved
it!

In other chambers he beheld lovely
little children, with the faces of angels;
or venerable grandsires; with
their snowy hair floating over the pillow,
and then he drew the most beautiful
pictures on the window pane, to
amuse them when they should wake.
He crept slyly into the larders of
thrifty housewives, and, with a touch,
made chickens and ducks hanging
there, quite stiff and tasteless; he[35]
skipped to the cistern, and magically
rendered the pump handle immovable;
he ran about the streets and
played tricks with the bright gas
lamps, and they went out, as though a
puff of wind had blown over them.
And, last of all, he ran against a stout
Burgomaster, returning homeward
from a merry supper, and so pinched
the end of his red bottle-nose, that it
tingled again!

"I'll have you taken to prison,
you scoundrel!" roared the Burgomaster;
but how was he to find Captain
Jack? Only where a large fire
was raging did Captain Jack shrink
away in haste; heat did not seem to
agree with him, for he looked strangely
small and shrunken.[36]

He was now weary of the city, and
hastened lightly to the seaside. In the
harbor ships lay at anchor, ice-bound;
and on one of these a young sailor
was keeping watch for thieves; but he
saw not Captain Jack coming softly
on board, and peering over his shoulder
to see what was written on the
paper he held in his hand. A lantern
hung from the mast and shed a feeble
light on the tear-blistered page, where
the pious mother implored a blessing
on her son. As he read, the young
sailor also wept; but Captain Jack
had no taste for tears. He breathed
on the letter, and the sparkling drops
that the reader let fall became beads
of ice. The sailor hastily turned, and
for a moment fancied he beheld the[37]
brilliant eyes of Captain Jack gazing
upon him; but the next instant he saw
only two glittering icicles, which had
formed on the ropes.

The sea gulls flew in circles round
the vessel; late as it was, they still
hoped something might be thrown out.
Captain Jack caught them by the long
feathers of their wings, and they tumbled
on the deck, and hopped stiffly
about. "Creesh, creesh!" cried they;
"it is that villain, Captain Jack, who
has served us thus! Ugh! how stiff
we are!"

Crick, crack! sounded through the
air. It was Captain Jack laughing at
them.

"How merry it is in winter!" he
cried. "It is there my uncle, the Ice[38]
King, holds his court in the palace at
the North Pole. The great icebergs
come crashing to the very door to do
him homage, and the white young
lady bears dance the Polonaise so
gracefully! We don't spend a moment
in silly thought about anything       no!
we frisk and caper about, and even
my uncle comes down from his throne
and hops around, as well as his age
will permit! and there I have such
glorious sport in the long moonlight
nights!"

"Bur-r-r!" grumbled the north
wind, sweeping by. "Thou hadst better
hurry home, thou silly madcap!
The sun is coming, and he is no friend
of thine!"

"Many thanks!" cried Captain[39]
Jack again, with a graceful bow;
"I see, truly, that my sport is over for
to-night!" and he now looked about
him with mischievous eyes, to see if
there were not some last trick that he
could play before he fled to his forest
cave. But there was no time to lose,
for already the round red sun, winking
and blinking sleepily behind his bed
curtains of red clouds, was rising from
the sea; and, with a sudden leap, Captain
Jack flung himself off the ship,
and hastened away.

The river was all covered with
ice; the little hares skipped over it;
in the town everybody was bawling
for water, and the pump handles were
hard and fast; the Burgomaster had
his nose tied up in brown paper and[40]
warm vinegar; the naughty people
went about with cricks in their necks
and colds in their heads; while every
withered grass blade, every branch of
tree and bush, and every pane in the
windows, was covered with the beautiful,
fantastic, glittering handiwork
of Captain Jack Frost!



As the story ended, the door above
suddenly opened, and the Herr Hartman
himself came out; and certainly
looked somewhat surprised at seeing
his good friend sitting there on the
lower step.

"Why, my dear Herr Ekstein!"
he exclaimed. "Is anything the matter?"
and he hastened down the steps.

The literary man jumped up, and
saw the Herr holding out his hand.[41]

"Nay, then, my good friend!" he
exclaimed, "I have been hearing the
merriest tale!"

"But come in! come in!" cried
the Herr Hartman. "Some of our
friends are with us; let us spend a sociable
evening together."

With a pleased and happy face the
literary man entered the house, and
the warm room, where the company
were assembled; and, amid peals of
laughter, related both the story of
Captain Jack, and that of the sleigh-ride
to Ol        's, with the deuse himself
as driver!



[42]
THE CABBAGES;

OR, THE DISCREET WIFE.


In a remote part of Swabia there
once dwelt a rich peasant, who was
noted in all the neighborhood for his
shrewdness. No one could get the
better of him in a bargain, and no
man managed his farm with such extraordinary
success. His crops always
seemed to flourish when the whole
country round was desolated with the
blight; his hay was sure to be got in
the very night before a flood swept[43]
away the ricks of his neighbors; his
cows gave the most milk, his oxen
were the fattest, and his fields the
most fruitful of the whole valley. In
short, Wise Peter, for so he was
called, became wealthy year after
year, in a way which made his less
fortunate neighbors shake their heads
enviously, declaring "that such marvellous
good luck could only be obtained
by a bargain with the Evil One,
or the assistance of gnomes." Whenever
any of these stories came to the
ears of Wise Peter, he would smile
and say, "Ah! who knows, indeed!"
but not a word more would he utter.

Among his other possessions, Wise
Peter owned an immense field, which
was planted entirely with cabbages.[44]
If one stood in the middle and gazed
around, nothing but cabbages and
more cabbages grew, as far as the eye
could reach; and as the fat burghers
of the town were all extremely fond
of sauerkraut, these were a source
of great profit.

It happened that Peter had a wife
as well known for her folly and empty
head, as her husband for his sagacity;
and as he was rightly named Wise
Peter, so was she equally well called
Silly Catharine. How the two came
to be united was a mystery to every
one; for certain it is, that Silly Catharine
had nothing to recommend her
to a sensible man, but her being young
and pretty.

Now Silly Catharine, who was as[45]
witless as she could well be, was fonder
of cabbages than anything else in the
world. She ate sauerkraut for breakfast,
cabbage soup for dinner, fried
cabbage for supper, and boiled cabbage
for a noonday treat. Not even
the constant scoldings of her husband,
or the jeers of the neighbors at her
folly, could distress her in any great
degree, if she had only plenty of cabbages.

One morning, Wise Peter loaded
his wagon with grain and started off
to sell it at the distant market town,
a good day's journey to and from the
village. "Now, Catharine," he said to
his wife as he departed, "I want you
to keep your wits about you, such as
you possess, while I am gone; therefore[46]
attend to me. You must give orders
that the men reap the wheat in
the large field, take care that the
young turkeys do not get among the
brambles, and, above all, see that no
one enters the little storeroom. They
are going to tax every one who is
worth five hundred guilders and over;
and as I don't choose to give my hard
earnings for the support of a parcel
of lazy nobles and a useless court, I
have hidden all the money bags there;
therefore, be careful that nobody
knows of it but yourself." So saying,
Peter mounted his wagon and drove
off. Silly Catharine looked after him
as long as he could be seen, and then
went back to the kitchen, determined[47]
to show her husband how clever she
had become.

"Shall I go and tell the goose girl
to hunt the turkeys into the coop
first?" thought she; "or shall I put
on the cabbage to boil? I think I will
set my cabbage on first; it will take
but a moment, the turkeys are safe till
then."

So she went to the larder, got out
a fine large cabbage, and hung the
pot over the fire, that it might boil
quickly. The steam of the cabbage
cooking ascended to her nose with a
delicious perfume, and at last, what
with hanging over the pot enveloped
in steam, and the heat of the fire, she
felt very drowsy, and falling into her
chair, was soon soundly asleep. She[48]
had not slept long before in came the
goose girl, whose business it was to
take charge of the fowls of all sorts,
crying out, "Oh, mistress! mistress:
the turkeys have got among the brambles,
and cannot get out!"

"Mercy upon us!" exclaimed
Catharine, springing up and wringing
her hands; "what will Peter say to
me! He will, doubtless, break his
stick over my shoulders. If it were not
for the cabbage on the fire, I should
certainly throw myself from the window!"
So saying, she ran out into
the field, but too late; the little turkeys
were all in the very middle of a
bramble bush, which had tangled in
their feathers, until it was impossible
to get them out; beside which, a fox[49]
had entered the barn yard in the
goose girl's absence, by the gate, which
she had carelessly left swinging open,
and carried off the biggest and handsomest
Poland rooster, that Wise Peter
valued even more than the turkeys.
About this last loss, however,
she said nothing, hoping that her mistress
wouldn't remark it. This, indeed,
proved to be the case; for, without
noticing the absence of poor
Chanticleer, Catharine burst into
tears, exclaiming, "What is to be
done? The only way is to cut the
bush down."



THE FATE OF POOR CHANTICLEER.


As she spoke, she seized an axe,
and with one blow felled the bush to
the ground. But what was her horror
to find, as she let fall the axe, that she[50]
had also struck off the heads of every
one of the turkeys!

"Oh heavens! what a misfortune!"
cried Catharine; "I am the most unlucky
woman in the world! Now Wise
Peter will not leave a whole bone in
my body! Alas, the turkeys would
have sold for eight skillings apiece
when they had grown fat and big!
The only thing that consoles me is,
that I shall have such a famous supper
ready for him. When he tastes
my fine cabbage soup, I am sure he
must forget to be vexed!" There were
still, however, the bodies of the turkeys
to see after; so she took out her
needle and thread, sewed the heads of
the turkeys on their necks, and set
them upright in the coop, that they[51]
might look as though they were still
alive.

After this precious piece of cleverness,
Silly Catharine returned to the
house to see how her cabbage came
on. But she had been gone so long
that the water in the pot had all boiled
away, and the cabbage was burning
on hard and fast to the bottom of the
pot. "Why, bless me! where can the
water have gone to?" cried Silly
Catharine. "It must have all drawn
up chimney! Nevertheless, it would
be a pity to lose it; full of the cabbage
juice as it was, it might well have
been made into soup; and Wise Peter
has told me a hundred times never to
waste anything. I will get something[52]
to let down the chimney and see if I
can dip it up."

So saying, she began to look about
for a rope long enough to reach down
the chimney; but she couldn't find
one. All at once her eye fell on the
bucket standing outside the well. Joyfully
rushing to it, she cut the rope,
and dragging the bucket after her,
scrambled out on the roof, and began
letting it down the chimney. While she
was thus engaged, a poor little frightened
swallow, who had built its nest
there, suddenly flew up the chimney
and darted right in her face. Silly
Catharine was so much frightened,
that she gave a loud scream and let
go of the rope. The bucket, of course,
fell into the middle of the fire, and in[53]
a twinkling was burnt to cinders.
Down from the roof, and into the
kitchen, rushed Catherine, but too
late; nothing save the iron hoops now
remained of the bucket.

"What shall I do?" cried Silly
Catharine. "Not an hour passes but
some new misfortune occurs. Alas! I
am no longer able to draw water for
my soup! but stay, I think of a way!"
So saying, she took the pot from the
hook, tied a rope to the handle, let it
down the well, with the cabbage still
in it, and when it was filled carried it
back to the house, and hung it over
the fire.

Soon afterward the dairy maid
went to draw some water for dinner.
She could not find the bucket; so she[54]
let down a milk pail instead; but
when she came to taste the water, she
tasted also the flavor of the cabbage,
and ran to her mistress, calling out,
"Why, mistress, who has been meddling
with our fine well? It had once
the best water in the neighborhood,
but now the flavor is precisely that of
a greasy, horrible cabbage!"

"Nonsense!" cried Silly Catharine,
with an air of contempt; "it is all
your fancy. Don't tell me that water
can taste of cabbages!" Her heart
beat with affright, however, and as
soon as the servant maid had left the
room, she ran in great terror to the
wine cellar. "What the servant said
must have been true," thought she;
"and Wise Peter will never forgive[55]
me when he finds out that I have
spoilt the well. I will, therefore, pour
some wine into the water, to take
away the taste of the cabbages." So
saying, she seized one of the wine barrels,
and in the strength of terror she
managed, with great difficulty, to push
it up the cellar stairs, and roll it
through the kitchen out to the well.
Then she removed the spile and tilted
the cask forward; when out streamed
at least thirty gallons of the finest Tokay
down the well!

Having done this, Silly Catharine
hid the barrel away with great precipitation;
and, determined to leave
nothing else undone, she called the
reapers and bid them go directly to
the large field and reap the wheat.[56]
Then she went back, and began eating
her dinner, saying, "Thank heaven, I
have a good dinner to sit down to, at
least; there are always cabbages
enough!"

Meanwhile, the reapers made ready
to go a-field; and before they went,
one of them drew a bucket of water
to carry with them. But no sooner
had they tasted the water, than they
cried out, "'Tis wine! the finest
wine!" and scarcely able to believe
their senses, they drew up bucket after
bucket of this new liquor, drank till
they became drunk, and then tumbled
senseless among the wheat; for it
happened that the well was very low,
and what they drew was nearly all
wine. While they lay there, a violent[57]
hail storm came on, and in an hour's
time the whole of the wheat was
beaten to the ground, drenched,
crushed, and ruined.

Unconscious of this fresh misfortune,
Silly Catharine prepared her soup
for supper, and then, having finished
her work, she sat down in the front
porch and began to knit, feeling as if
at last all her troubles were over.
Presently the gate was opened, and a
man entered the garden. It was he
who was appointed to gather the tax,
and knowing Wise Peter to be well
off, it was to his house that he first
came.

"Oh, you are very much mistaken
if you think I will pay your outrageous
tax!" cried Silly Catharine. "No, no![58]
Wise Peter would know better than
that, and his wife will not be behind
hand! He told me before he went
that he had no money to pay, and if
he had, he wouldn't give it to support
your lazy nobles; so be off with you!"

While Catharine had been making
this tirade, the tax gatherer, to whom
she had unwittingly given a valuable
hint, hit upon a new plan by which to
secure his guilders. So as she paused,
out of breath, he exclaimed, in a contemptuous
tone: "There is no use in
making such a noise, good woman; I
see plainly that I was a fool to suppose
the owner of this beggarly house
was worth five hundred guilders. Five
kreutzers would be much nearer the
mark!"[59]

"What! do you dare to call the
house of Wise Peter beggarly!" cried
Catharine in a rage; "beggarly, indeed!
you could never get such a fine
one if you live a thousand years."

"And I repeat that it is a beggarly
house," said the other; "with a poor,
miserable family in it."

"You don't believe me?" screamed
Silly Catharine; "well, then I'll show
you what you call poor; a pretty
thing, indeed, that you should say we
are a beggarly family!" And, bouncing
from her seat, she led the tax
gatherer to the store room, and dragging
the money bags from their concealment,
she opened them triumphantly,
saying, "There, what do you
call that?"[60]

"At least a thousand guilders!"
exclaimed the tax gatherer, astonished
at seeing so much more than he had
expected. "So, you refuse to pay the
tax when you have all this money in
the house! I confiscate it all in the
name of the king, and you may think
yourself lucky if you and your precious
husband (who must be wise, since he
married such a wife as you), don't get
thrown into prison besides." So saying,
he snatched up the bags of guilders,
while Catharine stood staring at
him in mute horror, and in an instant
was out of the house, and gone on his
way.

Nearly stunned with this new mishap,
Catharine burst into tears, and
ran down stairs crying, as though her[61]
heart would break. "What is to become
of me," she sobbed, "when Peter
comes home? He will certainly
kill me for having shown the tax
gatherer the money! Nevertheless,
what could I do? It was impossible
to have people say that Wise Peter
was a beggarly creature       I could not
allow that!" and, a little re-assured,
she dried her eyes and went to taste
the soup. It was nearly done, and
tasted deliciously. "Ah!" cried Silly
Catharine, "the soup is better than
usual! It quite repays me for all to
think that we still have the finest cabbages!"

In the mean time, one of the
reapers, who had drank less wine than
the others, woke up sober, and as soon[62]
as he found he could stand on his legs,
he ran post haste to the village to
relate the wonderful tale. The place
being small and the gossips many, it
was not half an hour before the whole
population knew the extraordinary
occurrence that had taken place.
Even the cur        , the magistrate, and the
doctor rushed into the street to hear
the news, and a pretty uproar there
was. "Said I not truly that Wise
Peter was in league with the Evil
One?" exclaimed one, "for only thus
can the miracle of a spring of wine be
accounted for." "True, true!" cried
the listeners; "a wizard he must be;
and that of a right dangerous sort!"

Just at this moment, the wagon
of Wise Peter was seen coming along[63]
the road. The impatient villagers
could not wait for him to approach
them, but rushed toward the wagon
and surrounded it on every side.
"How now, wretched wizard!" they
one and all shouted; "dare you look
us in the face when we have found
you out in your sorceries? Away with
you to prison!" and, so saying, they
laid hold of Wise Peter, dragged him
out of the wagon, and bore him toward
the magistrate. In vain the wretched
man begged for some explanation, declared
a hundred times over that he
was no wizard, but an honest peasant;
they only shouted, tauntingly, "A
pretty story for a man who turns his
well springs into the finest wine! no[64]
wizard, indeed! say, rather, a wizard
of the worst kind!"

With these words, they hauled him
before the magistrate, where, again,
the reaper repeated his story, adding,
by way of proof, "If you don't believe
me, go and see the other reapers;
there they lie drunk, where I left
them."

"You hear what this honest man
says," said the magistrate. "We have
long suspected you of sorcery, but this
proves the matter at once. Either you
must forfeit a hundred guilders, as ordained
by law in such cases, or you
must go to prison."

Almost distracted, Wise Peter exclaimed,
"You have seen fit, worthy
magistrate, to accuse me of a crime[65]
of which, so far from being guilty, I
know nothing whatever. When I left
home this morning, I swear the water
was as fresh and pure as possible. I
know that some envious people had
long accused me of practising black
arts, and if Industry and Prudence
are black arts, I am certainly guilty;
but in this matter of the water, I am
as innocent as my own wife!"

"All this is very fine," answered
the magistrate; "but it happens that
the bewitched water can be produced;"
and turning to the reaper, he
said, "Have you any of this water
about you?"

"Yes, worthy magistrate," replied
the reaper; "as I came away from the[66]
field, I filled my flask with what was
left, and brought it with me."

The flask was handed to Peter,
and no sooner had he tasted it, than
he fell back aghast, exclaiming,
"Good heaven, it is wine! and very
like Tokay!"

"What! you confess it yourself?"
cried the magistrate. "Don't hope,
then, for mercy! You shall now pay
two hundred guilders, or go to prison
for a year!"

"Mercy! mercy!" cried the unfortunate
man, falling on his knees.
"Consider my family, worthy magistrate;
do not disgrace them by sending
me to prison! I see the water has
been changed, but not by me; and
though you will not believe me, I can[67]
solemnly assure you, with perfect
truth, that I am innocent."

"Pay or go to prison!" answered
the magistrate inexorably.

With many tears and groans, the
unlucky Peter drew a purse full of
guilders from his pocket and paid over
the whole proceeds of his sale of
wheat, which only amounted to a
hundred and five guilders; the magistrate
remarking that he would let him
off with that if he would solemnly
swear never to practise the black art
any more, and to unbewitch his well
as speedily as possible. This Peter
did, in despair of bringing them to
reason, and having been thus severely
punished for a crime he was utterly
guiltless of, he mounted his wagon[68]
again, and rode home in a state of
mind that can better be imagined than
described.

When he reached his own home
he rapped on the window as usual, to
warn his wife, and Catharine rushed
out to meet him, and, throwing her
arms round his neck, cried, "Oh, Peter,
I am so glad you have returned;
the good cabbage soup is all ready for
you; so come right in and eat it!"

"Eat!" exclaimed Wise Peter,
"how can I swallow a mouthful when
I am so overwhelmed with misfortune?"

"What! you also!" said Catharine;
"alas! what has happened?"



PETER     S RETURN HOME.


With accents that trembled with
rage and grief, Wise Peter told how[69]
he had been treated in the village;
but he had scarcely made an end before
Catharine, bursting into tears, exclaimed,
"Oh, what will become of
me! Have mercy, Peter, for it was I
who poured the wine down the well!"

"Poured wine down the well!"
cried Peter, starting in astonishment;
"then, for heaven's sake, why did you
do that?"

"Because," sobbed his wife, "the
water tasted of cabbages!"

"Of cabbages!" repeated the
peasant, in greater surprise than ever,
"and what made it taste of cabbages?"

"Because I dipped up water in
the cabbage pot," cried Silly Catharine.[70]

"And where was the bucket?"
asked her husband.

"I burnt it, trying to dip the water
out of the chimney, that had been
drawn up from the cabbage pot!"
gasped Catharine, feeling that everything
must now be told, since she had
begun.

Wise Peter took two or three
strides across the room in silence;
then, making a violent effort to speak
quietly, he said, "And why, Catharine,
since you supposed that water could
be drawn up a chimney, did you leave
the pot unwatched?"

Almost in a scream, Silly Catharine
broke out, "Because I was sewing on
the turkeys' heads that I struck off
cutting down the bramble bush!!"[71]

"Now, was ever any man tormented
with such a fool of a wife!" shouted
Peter, almost beside himself with rage.
"I could beat you with pleasure for
acting so witlessly, but that, alas!
would not pay for what you have lost
for me this day. A hundred and five
guilders of my precious money have I
been made to pay for your foolery,
besides losing my Tokay wine, my
field of wheat, and all my fine young
turkeys! at least a hundred guilders
more!"

"Oh, and that's not the worst!"
cried Catharine.

"What! is there any more to
come?" exclaimed Peter, almost out
of his senses.

"Yes," stammered Silly Catharine;[72]
"the man came here to gather the
tax, and I told him, as you said, that
you were far too clever to pay it, and
that he would get nothing more out
of me. Then he said you were a beggarly
fellow, not worth five kreutzers,
and, of course, I couldn't allow that;
so I showed him the guilders in the
store room, to prove that he spoke
falsely, and he took every one of
them! I am so sorry, but never
mind, there is excellent cabbage soup
for supper!"

At this, Peter could restrain himself
no longer, and falling upon Silly
Catharine, he trounced her well with
his stick, until she cried out for mercy.
"There!" he said at last, throwing
down the stick, "you have been[73]
well punished, though not half enough
to pay for the mischief you have
done."

Silly Catharine dried her eyes upon
her apron, and with a reproachful
look exclaimed, "Still you have beaten
me, Wise Peter, for what I could not
help; for, if the turkeys had not been
killed, I should never have stayed
away so long; if the water had not
flown up chimney, I should not have
burnt the bucket; and if the well had
not tasted of cabbages, I should not
have thrown in the wine. And, above
all, dear Peter, if that abominable man
spoke ill of you, how could I, your
wife, avoid showing him that he lied?
Besides, the case is not so bad; we
have lost nearly all, it is true; but,[74]
thank heaven, we still have delicious
cabbages!"

In spite of himself, Wise Peter
could not help bursting out laughing.
"After all, Catharine," he exclaimed,
"I see you did not intend doing me
any harm; if you are a fool, that, certainly,
is not your fault; therefore, in
future let us never be separated. Come,
you pretty goose, let us go and eat
cabbage soup."

So saying, Wise Peter kissed his
wife's blooming cheek, and led her
into the house. They sat down with
contented hearts to the nice, smoking
soup, and after supper walked out
among the spreading cabbages.



[75]
THE WONDERFUL LEGEND OF THE GOLD STONE.


In those far away times when the
world was yet in its baby clothes, and
people were not as wise as they are
nowadays, there dwelt in the good
town of London a poor tailor's apprentice
named Bartlemy Bowbell. He
might be called poor in a double
sense; for not only was he such a
lazy, idle fellow that he scarcely ever
took a stitch, and so seldom had a
copper of his own, but he was a miserable
workman, and, like an organ-grinder's[76]
monkey, or a blind man's
dog, obtained more kicks than halfpence.

In the same room with him were
several other tailors; who sang together
one of two tunes as they
stitched. If they were paid for every
day's work, be it much or little, they
sang, "By the d-a-y! by the d-a-a-y!
by the d-a-a-a-y!" and the needles
went in and out as slowly as the
coaches of a funeral procession; but
if they were paid for every garment
they finished, then they sang,
"By the job! by the job! by the
job!" and the needles stitched away
like an express train! Bartlemy, however,
crossed his legs, put his thimble
firmly on, and stitched briskly for five[77]
minutes; then his attention would
wander, and presently, dropping
work, thimble, shears, and needle,
he began singing to himself,


"Oh, if I were only possessed of my riches,
I never would sew on a pair of old breeches!
Thimbles and thread!
Buttons and braid!
Oh, who would be bound to this rascally trade?

"If money I had, I'd be free from all care,
And what master must make, I should have but to wear!
Needles and pins!
Shears and cloth ends!
When the work's ended then pleasure begins!"


"What's that you're singing about
riches?" cried his master, sharply;
"Riches, forsooth! you will die in the
poor house, I can tell you, if you don't
stitch more diligently! Come, sew
away! sew away!" So saying, he[78]
gave him a good thwack with his yard
stick, to make him continue working.





All the beatings in the world, however,
could not thump out of Bartlemy
Bowbell a belief that had got into his
head that he should one day become
rich and famous, through the agency
of a wonderful jewel called the Gold
Stone. As I said, people, in those
days, were by no means so wise as
they are at present, and so it fell out[79]
that the most learned philosophers of
that olden time believed as firmly as
did the tailor's apprentice in the existence
of this Gold Stone, the peculiar
property of which was, that if it came
in contact with any common metal, it
changed it, on that instant, into gold.
Now, this story had come to the ears
of Bartlemy Bowbell, and by one of
those odd cranks that not overwise
people sometimes take in their heads,
he was perfectly persuaded that,
sooner or later, he was fated to find
the miraculous gem.

Matters soon rose to such a pitch,
as may easily be seen, that his master
finally turned him out of doors, saying
"that he ate more than he would ever
earn."[80]



"Very well, master," quoth Bartlemy,
"I don't regret your goose and
cabbage!" and having said this, he
ran away as hard as he could, dropping
one of his slipshod shoes as he
went along, with his master pursuing
after, yard stick in hand, whom, however,
he soon contrived to outstrip.



As he had not earned a penny during
the week, he was entirely without[81]
money, and nobody would lodge a
shabby apprentice with only one shoe,
for nothing. He wandered on until he
was clear of London and in the open
fields, begging of those he met on the
road, but who always replied to his
solicitation, "Why don't you go to
work, you lazy 'prentice?" for they
knew what he was, because he wore a
'prentice's flat cap. Worst of all,
night now came on, and Bartlemy was
at last compelled to lie down beneath
a tree, where he soon fell asleep. The
moon rose high, and still Bartlemy
snored, when, all of a sudden, he was
roused by a smart blow on the shoulder
from what he could have sworn
was a yard stick.

"Needles and pins!" cried Bartlemy,[82]
sitting up in haste; "what's
that?"

"Bartlemy Bowbell," croaked a
strange voice, "look at me."

Bartlemy looked round, and to his
extreme terror, saw standing beside
him a being whom he could only suppose
to be a goblin. He was not more
than four feet high, with very bow
legs, as though from a constant habit
of tucking them up on a tailor's shop
board; his clothes, fashioned from odd
bits of velvet and cloth such as tailors
call "cabbage," or, as we should say,
the pieces of the customers' stuff left
from their coats       were trimmed with
thimbles for bell buttons; on his head
was a tailor's cotton nightcap, with a
long tassel, and hanging at his waist[83]
were an immense pair of shears, and a
pincushion bristling with needles and
pins. In one hand he carried the yard
stick with which he had struck the
luckless 'prentice, and in the other a
tailor's goose, or flat iron.

His face was expressive of the
most jovial good humor, though it
could not be called handsome, for his
nose was flattened as though he were
in the habit of trying his iron against
the end; his hair seemed composed
of long and short threads mingled together,
and he had an abominable
squint, as though he were always endeavoring
to see how a coat set at the
front and back, the collar and tail at
the same time.[84]

"Bartlemy," said the goblin again,
"what's the matter with you?"

"Matter, your worship?" gasped
Bartlemy.

"Come to the point," said the
goblin, severely, accidentally swinging
his pincushion against Bartlemy's legs
at the same time, and pricking him
most atrociously. "You are everlastingly
growling and grumbling, instead
of working at your trade like an honest
tailor, and richly deserve to be
thwacked with the yardstick every
morning by way of breakfast; but
never mind, I choose to help you; so
say what you want, quick."

"A-and who might your worship
be?" asked Bartlemy, with a cold
shudder; for he felt desperately afraid[85]
that he had got hold of Old Boguey
or Old Nick       it was not much matter
which.

"That's none of your business,"
said the being; "but if you must
know, I am Snippinbitz, the patron of
the tailors."

"O lord, your worship, you don't
say so!" stammered Bartlemy.

"That's a fact!" returned the goblin.
"Come, out with it; what can I
do for you?"

Bartlemy scratched his head and
took off his cap, looked into it, found
no words there, and put it on again;
and finally, with a bow that nearly
toppled him head over heels, and a
kick up of his foot that sent his remaining[86]
slipper flying into the nearest
mud-puddle, he managed to say:

"Please, your worship, I want to
find the Gold Stone."

The goblin burst into a discordant
laugh on hearing this; then, suddenly
becoming serious, he said:

"Well, that's a sensible request,
Bartlemy, and a modest one, considering
the circumstances. Never mind, I
have taken a fancy to you; your wish
shall be accomplished. See here."

With these words Snippinbitz put
his hand in his pocket, and pulled out
a magnificent jewel, as it seemed to
Bartlemy. It was of the most resplendent
purple color imaginable, and
sparkled all over with flecks of gold,
which seemed to swim beneath the[87]
surface. Nothing could look more
gorgeously beautiful as the astonished
tailor held it up in the moonlight;
yes, there could be no doubt of it;
the mysterious, the unattainable Gold
Stone was really his!

"Now, Bartlemy, attend to me,"
continued the being. "The Gold Stone
is yours, but under certain conditions,
which must be faithfully complied
with, or no gold! First, you must
return to London to-morrow, seek out
your old master, and ask him to employ
you as a regular workman. You
will find yourself able to sew as well
as the best, through my assistance,
and you must employ this power diligently
on the work he gives you to
do. I warn you, however, that you[88]
must keep the secret of the Gold Stone
from everybody; and, in order that
you may do so, you must never take it
out of your pouch until you are safe
in your own chamber. Secondly, when
you receive your wages, place the
money directly in the pouch containing
the Gold Stone, and do not look at
it until you go to bed. Then you will
find the copper turned into silver, and
the silver into gold. But if you count
the money first, it will never be any
different. Thirdly, in a year's time
from to-night, meet me at this spot, and
tell me how you have prospered. Will
you keep these conditions faithfully?"

"Ye-y-es! your worship!" stammered
the 'prentice.

"Then, how are you, Mr. Gold[89]
Stone!" exclaimed the goblin, in advance
of the age; and, with an outrageous
wink, he treated Bartlemy to
another whack with the yardstick,
and vanished.

The blow struck our tailor insensible;
and when his eyes again unclosed
it was broad daylight. For a
moment he stared about him, wondering
how he came to be there; then,
remembering the extraordinary events
of the previous night, he hastily felt
in his pouch, and drew out the miraculous
jewel. It flamed in the sunlight
like a bright diamond eye, and Bartlemy
almost fancied he caught it
winking at him. This idea lasted but a
moment, and having taken a long and
delighted stare at the much-desired[90]
Gold Stone, he replaced it carefully in
his pouch, and started straight for
London. As he passed the newly-opened
bakers' shops, he could not
help wishing that he had a half-penny
in the world, so that he might change
it into a crown on the spot, and buy
a basketful of hot rolls; but as the
Gold Stone was not warranted to make
money, he was forced to take it out
in wishing. Fortunately one of the
bakers, seeing him gaze hungrily at
the hot bread, had the kindness to
toss him a large roll; and, munching
this, he arrived at his master's shop.

After the way in which he had
been turned out, he hadn't much hope
of getting in again, but, afraid of disobeying
the goblin's injunctions, he[91]
entered with as much courage as he
could muster, and found the other
tailors stitching away as usual, while
his master cut out a coat.

Bartlemy took his cap humbly off,
saying, "Please, master, if you will
employ me as a workman now, I think
I can please you. Do try me; I will
be industrious; indeed, I will."

"Oh," grumbled the master tailor,
"sleeping out in the fields and going
without supper and breakfast has
done you good, has it? Well, take
this coat and sit you down; but I
warn you, beforehand, that if you are
not more industrious than usual, I will
lay my yardstick over your shoulder,
and clear you out again."

Bartlemy took the work, and having[92]
planted himself on the shop-board[A]
in his favorite place, near a window,
he put on his thimble, threaded his
needle with a grand flourish, and began
to stitch away for dear life. He
sewed faster and better than he had
ever done before, and found, to his
joy, that the goblin's promises had
begun to be fulfilled in reality. But
bad habits are not to be conquered as
one would pull up weeds: though both
must be torn up by the roots, one
might weed three gardens in the time
it takes to destroy one fault; and so,
without really meaning it, Bartlemy
at last began to ply his needle less
briskly; his thoughts wandered; he[93]
took a stitch that was three times too
long, then another in a wrong place, a
third and fourth all askew, and finally
the work came to a dead stand-still.
But, thimbles and thread! what happened?
The instant his hand stopped,
a long yellow yardstick came flying
through the window, with no one
holding it, hit him such a thwack on
the shins that he roared again with the
pain, and instantly vanished.

"Why, what's the matter?" asked
the other tailors, startled, as they well
might be.

"Matter!" cried Bartlemy. "Why,
didn't you see that       that horrible
yardstick coming at me?"

At this they all laughed at him for
a fool; for nobody but our tailor[94]
could perceive this terrific weapon,
which was doubtless invisible to common
eyes. His conscience whispered,
however, that his punishment was a
reminder from the friendly goblin, and
accordingly he set to work with renewed
diligence. After a while, lost
in dreams of his approaching wealth,
he stopped stitching again, when, like
a flash, in came the yardstick, touched
him up with a vengeance, and vanished
as before; and so it continued all
the time he was sewing: the watchful
yardstick would only allow him to
stop to thread his needle or turn the
work.

When he had stitched all the
seams, he laid the coat on the table
and heated his goose, that he might[95]
smooth them. He took care to post
himself a good way from the window,
in order to get rid of the ferocious
yardstick; but the goblin was not to
be baffled thus. The moment he
stopped ironing and began to count
the flies on the ceiling, the goose
seemed to carry his hand up with it       irresistibly       to
the end of his nose, and
gave it a good scorching! This was
no joke, I can tell you, and in a very
short time Bartlemy began so to dread
the visits of his two enemies that he
never left working a minute, and his
needle dashed along like magic. By
sunset the coat was done, and sewed
in a manner vastly superior to the
other tailors, who looked at him with
envious eyes. "What! finish a whole[96]
coat in one day?" they cried; "we
never could do so well! Goose and
cabbage! friend Bartlemy! you must
have the assistance of some fairy!"

Bartlemy made no answer, but
taking the coat in hand, carried it
to his master, who viewed it in the
greatest astonishment. Never before
had a coat been made in a single day,
and stitched, too, more finely than
anything he had ever seen; but, not
wishing to raise his late 'prentice's
ideas of himself, he merely grumbled
out, "For a wonder you have done
your work this time; so now take
your wages, and be sure to come early
Monday morn."

As he spoke, he slipped a couple
of coins into Bartlemy's hand, who,[97]
remembering the goblin's words, put
them into his pouch without so much
as looking at them.

Now, no doubt my clever little
readers have guessed quite readily the
true solution of this mighty mystery;
but to the simple Bartlemy the reality
of the Gold Stone's magic power
was placed beyond a doubt when, on
reaching his chamber and striking a
light, he found, instead of the farthing
and penny which had always been
his weekly payment, a crown and sixpence.

"Huzzah! huzzah!" he cried, fairly
jumping for joy; "my beautiful
Gold Stone is doing its work bravely."
He kissed the stone in his delight, and
went to bed, to dream of becoming a[98]
master tailor, and making clothes for
the king.

The following Monday he repaired
to his master's shop the first of any
one, and everything happened as on
the former time; except that, being
more diligent at his work, the goose
and the yardstick were less frequent
in their favors, and he now made a
coat and a vest in the day. His master
really knew not what to think; but at
least so good a workman was not to
be lost; so he kept his surprise and
suspicions to himself, and made up by
heaping more and more sewing on the
luckless Bartlemy.

It didn't make any difference,
however; his needle almost seemed to
work by itself, and the sewing was[99]
finished by sunset; so that, really, the
good-natured goblin was the original
sewing machine, and no thanks to
Messrs. Grover and Baker. At the end
of the week his master paid him a
crown and a shilling; or, as Bartlemy
believed, a farthing and a penny; the
next week a guinea, and the week after
a guinea and a crown, which was
the highest wages ever paid.

So things went on, until Bartlemy
had earned enough to make quite a
fortune in his eyes; ten whole guineas
lay glittering in the old night cap
where he kept his savings, and the
tailor thought he might now set up
for a gentleman. So he bought cloth,
made himself, in secret, a fine cloak,
coat, and breeches, and in these jackdaw[100]
adornments paraded about the
streets a whole morning, trying to appear
an idle fine gentleman. At last
he strutted into the best inn, ordered
a grand dinner and a bottle of wine,
and feasted like a lord.

But his time was coming. The
watchful goblin, though not at his
side, knew perfectly well what he was
about, and soon led him to betray his
quality most fatally. When the bill
was brought him, it was so long and
so tremendous that Bartlemy sprang
up in a rage, crying out:

"Thimbles and thread! Do you
call this a decent charge for your paltry
dinner?"

The landlord stared at him in astonishment;
then, suddenly bursting into[101]
a loud laugh, he cried, "Why, gentles
all, this fine nobleman is nothing but
a tailor! ha! ha!" and he put his
hands to his fat sides and shook with
laughter.

"Be silent, sirrah!" thundered
Bartlemy; "or I'll break my yardstick
over your shoulders!"

"Ha! ha! only hear what he
says!" laughed the landlord. "A
miserable tailor."

"If you do not stop your impertinence,
I will shear off your ears like
cloth clippings!" retorted the angry
tailor. "Goose and cabbage! man;
you shall not trifle with me!"

On this the landlord and waiters
turned him bodily out of the house,
after seizing upon all his remaining[102]
money; and the moment he was in
the street, the knowledge of how he
had betrayed himself broke upon his
mind. Mortified and miserable, he hurried
home, determined, after this, to
stick to his trade and play fine gentleman
no more.

The year at last drew to a close,
and Bartlemy had now earned enough
to set up for a master tailor; when, one
bright moonlight night, he suddenly
remembered that it was the very anniversary
of his meeting with the goblin.
Starting up, he ran to where his
pouch was placed, took out the Gold
Stone and enjoyed a long look at it,
and then, throwing his cloak around
him, he hastened forth. The moonlight
beamed brightly on the path he[103]
was taking, and seemed to throw all
sorts of queer shadows before him;
now it was an immense yardstick,
now a thimble supported on two needles
like a pair of spindle legs, then a
goose with a pair of shears astride on
the handle.

At last, as he paused under the old
tree, he heard a familiar croaking
laugh, and found himself unexpectedly
in the presence of Snippinbitz, the
friendly goblin.

"Well, Bartlemy," croaked the
being; "and how have you prospered
with the Gold Stone?"

"Marvellously well, your worship!"
replied Bartlemy, in a joyous
tone.

"And you found a crown and a[104]
shilling, and a guinea and a crown,
instead of your penny and farthing;
did you, Bartlemy?"

"Why, yes, your worship, I did,
certainly."

"And the Gold Stone changed
them, did it, Bartlemy?"

"Why, yes, your worship; of
course it did."

"Now, Bartlemy," said the goblin,
in a confidential tone, laying his hand
on the other's shoulder, "I want to
tell you something. It isn't the Gold
Stone!"

"It's       not       the       Gold       Stone!!"
gasped Bartlemy.

"Why, no, you donkey! there's no
such thing!"

Bartlemy turned fairly green and[105]
yellow with horror and disappointment.

"Listen to me, Bartlemy Bowbell,"
said the goblin; "nobody but a donkey
would suppose that a round bit
of purple glass              "

"Of purple glass!" repeated Bartlemy,
in a sort of dream.

"Don't interrupt, Bartlemy       that
a bit of purple glass could change copper
into gold. Your master paid you
the wages your work was worth, that
is all. There is no such preposterous
jewel on the face of the earth as you
imagine; but there is a true Gold
Stone, and its name is


'Faithful Industry!'"


As the goblin spoke these words,
he suddenly began to change his form,[106]
and grew taller and broader. His bell-button
thimbles fell off, his flat nose
became long and sharp, his thread
hair gave place to a bald pate, and
his whole appearance became wonderfully
like Bartlemy's master. He
raised his yardstick, brought it down
with a tremendous crack       and       Bartlemy
woke!

Yes! he was lying under the tree
where he had thrown himself down
the night before. The whole of what
had passed, Gold Stone, money, goblin,
and all, was but the fantastic tracery
of a dream; and above him really
stood his master, who had repented
of having turned away his luckless
'prentice, and had come to seek him.

The lesson was not lost, however,[107]
on our hero. He returned to his master's
shop, where he worked diligently,
without any yardstick coming after
him; and in three years' time rose to
be a master tailor, married his old
master's daughter, cut the coats of the
king himself, and took for his arms a
Gold Stone, supported by two shears,
and the motto:


Faithful Industry.

THE PHILOSOPHERS' TOUR.


There were once five learned men,
who had been shut up all their lives in
their studies, poking their noses into
saucepans full of cookeries, which did
not resemble savory soups or well-flavored
ragouts, wearing their eyes out
with reading books printed in the
crabbedest black letter possible, and
shrivelling up their brains with thinking,
until they quite rattled inside
their skulls, all in pursuit of out-o'-the-way knowledge.

There was really nothing scientific[109]
with which they were not acquainted;
while, in the mean time, one or two
little things, perfectly familiar to people
who use their eyes for the purpose
of noticing the common occurrences
and habits of every-day existence, and
exercise their understanding in everything
that can make life comfortable
and agreeable, had entirely escaped the
observation of our philosophers.

As the emperor allowed them each
a handsome pension to advance the
interests of science, they went on with
their discoveries rejoicing, and for a
long time had never stirred from their
apartments in one of His Majesty's
country palaces. They scarcely left
off thinking, when they were asleep;
never had the least idea what they[110]
were eating for dinner, or even what
the materials of that dinner looked
like; and, in short, were sublimely unconscious
of any of the ordinary affairs
or interests of life; and thought only
of sciences, and high-flown theories of
Health, of Natural Philosophy, Chemistry,
Botany, and goodness knows
what beside. The fifth and last of the
learned men was supposed to consider
silence as an art or science, since he
hardly ever said anything; and for
that reason was thought to be wiser
than the other four put together.

At last, one fine morning, one of
our learned men chanced to poke his
head out of the window, to see what
on earth had become of one of his
glass retorts, which he had filled with[111]
gas until it went off like a rocket; and
could not help being struck with the
blue sky, the fresh green herbage,
and the thousands of beautiful wild
flowers that sprinkled the grass. It
was a charming summer day; the birds
had not yet left off singing, and the
fresh breeze, fanning the bald forehead
of the philosopher, appeared
wonderfully pleasant.

"Why, bless me!" cried the philosopher,
whose name was Dr. Skihi;
"while I have been trying to reduce
chemistry to the uses of a penny post,
I never thought of remarking whether
it was a pleasant day or not. How
bright and beautiful everything looks!
Out-of-doors is a very good sort of
thing, after all. I declare, I've a great[112]
mind       pooh! nonsense; science       glorious
science, is a great deal more to
be regarded than a fine day in the
country."



DR. MUMBUDGET LOOKING OUT OF THE WINDOW.


So saying, he drew his head in
again, and turned to his books and
saucepans; for, you see, he was trying
to condense gas, and make it dart
through the air like a skyrocket, carrying
a letter, or a telegraphic message,
or even a traveller with it, if it
was made strong enough; but, so far,
he had only succeeded in breaking his
retorts, and blowing himself up till his
head came bump against the ceiling,
and knocked off little bits of plaster.
Everything in the study looked remarkably
dingy after the freshness of
the fields, and the doctor could not[113]
refrain from taking another peep.
This time, the contrast appeared even
greater than before, while directly underneath
his window there now stood
two pretty little girls, one holding a
great bunch of roses and other blooming
flowers, and both intent on a long
leaf of manuscript, which they were
puzzling and laughing over, calling it
"such a silly thing!" Our doctor, to
his great dudgeon, recognized it as
part of a learned treatise, his own
production, which had accidentally
blown out of the window; but, as to be
known as the writer of silly things is
not specially dignified, he preferred
saying nothing about the matter.

"I have a great mind," he said
again; "yes, I'll go and ask Dr.[114]
Sheepshanks if he does not think it
would be a good plan for us to take a
short trip into the country. No doubt
we should make some very important
discoveries."

Excusing the idea to himself in this
way, Dr. Skihi toddled up one pair of
stairs and down two pair of stairs, and
straight along a crooked corridor, and
all round a square hall, until he arrived
at the apartments of Dr. Sheepshanks.
He knocked at the door, and peeped
through the keyhole until he was told
to come in, when he opened the door
softly, and shut it with an astonished
bang, that made all the spiders, who
were dancing hornpipes in all the corners
(for the learned men would have
died rather than have their sacred[115]
studies disturbed by a house-cleaning)
stand on one leg for several minutes
with surprise, as a noise in the philosophers'
palace was a thing rather
more seldom met with than a crononhotonthologos.

The sight that caused Dr. Skihi to
commit such a breach of good manners
was Dr. Sheepshanks in the very
middle of a summersault! with his
flowered dressing gown about his ears
and his spindle shanks and black
stockings in the air, looking not unlike
a two-legged radish growing upside
down.

To him rushed Dr. Skihi, who,
catching his friend by the tails of his
dressing gown, had him right side up
in a hurry, exclaiming, "Crucibles and[116]
gasbags! my good sir, have you gone
crazy?"

"No, indeed," returned Dr. Sheepshanks,
with a gleeful laugh. "I have
made a discovery, sir       a great discovery.
I happened to look out of the
window, a moment ago, and I saw a
couple of little chaps racing up and
down, and playing at that topsy-turvy
game you saw me trying just now.
Their cheeks were so fat, and their
frames so sturdy, that I feel convinced
such exercises are the best promoters
of health in the world; and as I am
getting rather broken down myself,
while I am finding out what is the
best way for other people to keep
healthy, I thought I would try the
experiment. It does make the blood[117]
rush to the head somewhat, I must
confess; but it's a glorious thing, you
may depend! I feel twenty years
younger and better already, I assure
you!"

All this time Dr. Sheepshanks was
puffing and panting, with a very red
face and astonished air; but the new
theory had taken possession of him,
and he would have died at the stake
rather than allow that turning summersaults
was not the exercise best
adapted to old gentlemen of sixty.

Finding his friend so prepossessed
in favor of exercise, Dr. Skihi proposed
to him that they should go and
take a walk, to which he readily
agreed. Then they went to Dr. Smelfungus,
the great botanist, who was at[118]
present trying to graft japonicas on
bramble bushes: "It would improve
the appearance of the roadside so
much!" and Dr. Van Noostile, who
was writing a splendid work, in twenty-five
volumes, to prove that people's
feeling hot and cold was perfect fancy
and nonsense; and also giving a number
of scientific ways of finding out
whether it would rain or be clear,
and what time o' day it was, without
looking to see if the wind were east,
or running to stare at a clock; which,
no doubt, would be of the greatest use
to the world, and leave all the weathercocks
and watchmakers quite in the
shade. Last of all, they came to Dr.
Mumbudget, who had on his study
door the great doorplate you see in[119]
the picture, with his name engraved
on it in letters six inches long. As
usual, he said not a word in reply
to the invitation of his friends, but
nodded his head at them instead, until
he nearly nodded it off; and so, being
all of one mind, our philosophers
locked up their studies, put on their
five-cornered caps, and taking their
gold-headed canes and their note
books, to be ready to put down any
new fact that might turn up, started
off for a country ramble.

At first they walked along quietly
enough, admiring the prospect, and
enjoying the fresh air; but after a few
moments, Dr. Sheepshanks could no
longer resist the desire to put his new
theory of health into practice.[120]

"Really," he began, "it would be
much better for us always to pursue
our studies in the open air. Science
teaches us that the most healthy people
are the wild Indians       those children
of nature, who live under the
trees, dine off fresh fruits, and take
plenty of exercise. Let us be children
of nature, my friends, and improve
our health by running to that tree,"
pointing to one at some distance.

Accordingly, the philosopher started
off at an amble, followed by his
companions, who, with dressing gowns
flying in the wind, and books flying,
out of their pockets every minute,
presented rather ridiculous spectacles.
They were so deeply engaged that
they did not see Dr. Mumbudget[121]
quietly walking along behind, picking
up their scattered property.

So far so good; but unhappily,
not being accustomed to the habits of
children of nature, this sudden introduction
to the true mode of life discomposed
our learned doctors in no
small degree. Fairly aching from
head to foot with fatigue, Dr. Sheepshanks
was the first to pause, so out of
breath that he could hardly speak, yet
exclaiming, with a beaming face, "Ah!
you may depend, gentlemen, that the
only way to enjoy life is to take plenty
of exercise!"

This was drawing rather too hard
on the patience of his friends, after
what they had just endured, and Dr.
Skihi exclaimed, rather crossly, "At[122]
the same time, your exercise is a famous
thing to make one thirsty! I
would give a great deal to obtain a
drink of spring water; but that is impossible
at present."

"Impossible! why, there is nothing
easier!" said Dr. Smelfungus. "Science
teaches us that some vegetables
are nearly all water; turnips, for instance.
All you have to do is to get
a turnip and express the juice, and
there's your drink of water."

"How about going to a well?"
said Mumbudget; but nobody appeared
to hear him.

"And pray, are there any turnips
hereabout?" asked the chemist, impatiently.

Now, the fact was that Dr. Smelfungus[123]
had never seen a turnip; he
had only read in books that turnips
were round, watery vegetables, yellow
outside and full of juice; for he was
so interested in finding out all about
flowers and plants that came from
Australia, and other out of the way
places, that he never troubled his head
with common, homemade turnips       those
were too vulgar; but as he
wished to appear informed on all subjects,
he pointed hap-hazard to a field
beside the road saying, carelessly,
"Certainly; there are some."

Now, what do you think Dr. Smelfungus
had really pointed out? Why,
a musk-melon patch! and as his companions
knew no more than himself,
Dr. Skihi scrambled through the hedge[124]
without more ado, cut with his penknife
as many as he could carry, and
returned to his friends. You may believe
how they enjoyed the feast, sitting
on the soft moss, in the cool shade
of the trees; and after they were
through, Dr. Smelfungus gravely
wrote down, "Turnip       a large, round
vegetable growing on vines, with a
rough, yellow outside, ever so many
seeds in the middle, and tastes of nutmegs!"

After these exploits, the philosophers
continued on their way, and Drs.
Smelfungus and Sheepshanks felt more
proud of their learning than ever.
Meanwhile Dr. Mumbudget said nothing;
so they gave him credit either for
thinking a great deal, or being too big[125]
a donkey to admire such splendid experiments.

The sun had now mounted high,
and our travellers began to feel its
rays inconveniently warm. Dr. Van
Noostile, however, laughed them all to
scorn.

"Too warm! fiddlestick's end!" he
cried. "This feeling warm and cold
is all humbug. Dr. Skihi can tell you
that I went to the top of the house
with him every night for a week, last
winter, to look at a comet, in nothing
but a night gown and an umbrella,
and I never was better in my life!
Other people might have felt cold, or
caught cold; but I       I enjoyed the science
of the thing! If you feel too
warm, follow my plan; make up your[126]
minds you won't feel so, and the thing's
done!" and Dr. Van Noostile marched
proudly along in the hottest part of
the road, with his nose in the air,
though the sun blistered the end most
abominably! while the others, not to
be behindhand in wisdom, followed his
example; all but Mumbudget, who
kept in the shade of the trees growing
beside the road, and was secretly
voted a greater donkey than ever.

Fortunately for the rest, who might
otherwise have been sunstruck, a
friendly cloud bank, which had been
for some time gathering in the east,
now began to cover the sky completely;
and Dr. Mumbudget, speaking for
the second time, just said, "Rain coming;
better hurry on," and then relapsed
into silence.[127]

"Rain! no such thing!" cried Dr.
Van Noostile. "When it is about to
rain, you will observe that the swallows
fly low! and as I don't see a
sign of a swallow, you may depend
that              " His speech was interrupted
by a thunderclap, and then down
poured the flood! in one of those sudden,
heavy showers that so often take
place in summer, wetting the whole
party to the skin in less than two minutes.
It was of no use to run, and as
they plodded along in the wet, our
philosophers looked at Dr. Van Noostile
with faces in which anger and dismay
were equally mingled.

"Is this your knowledge of weather?"
exclaimed Dr. Skihi, in a pet.

"Science teaches us that even a[128]
child of nature should go in when it
rains!" snapped Dr. Sheepshanks.

"And though water is undoubtedly
necessary for internal refreshment; external
application, in the form of a
hard shower, is only suitable to plants!"
snarled Dr. Smelfungus.

In short, they all set upon the luckless
weather prophet, except Dr. Mumbudget,
who, when they had all scolded
themselves out of breath, quietly
pointed out a farm house they were
now approaching, and led the way
thither himself.

There was no need for words.
Gladly did the wretched philosophers
hasten to its shelter, and avail themselves
of the bright kitchen fire to dry
their flowered dressing gowns, and wet[129]
stockings and shoes. While they were
drying, and steaming like the safety
valve of a high-pressure steamboat,
the good woman of the house, not
without some doubts of their sanity,
set about preparing a savory meal. In
a short time this was ready, and the
others were just sitting down to a dish
of nice broiled ham and some light
wheaten biscuits, when Dr. Sheepshanks
exclaimed, with an air of
amazement, "Is it possible, my friends,
that you are willing to violate the
natural laws of health by eating dishes
at which a child of nature would be
horrified! Not for me be so degenerate
a meal! I shall lunch on fare such
as a wild Indian best loves!" So saying,
he tucked up his sleeves, called[130]
for some unground corn, and having
pounded it in a mortar until it was in
coarse bits, he mixed with it a little
water, and baked this horrible mess
before the fire, in the hot ashes. Then
he asked for a slice of bacon, as venison
was not at hand, frizzled the out
side slightly by holding it up on a cleft
stick before the fire, burning his ten
fingers several times in the process,
and bearing it with heroic fortitude.
Finally, he served up these atrocious
specimens of cookery on pieces of
board instead of dishes, as the proper
diet for children of nature       and philosophers!

As he could not induce the other
savants to prefer the luncheon of wild
Indians to that of civilized Christians,[131]
Dr. Sheepshanks ate it all up himself,
though, in fact, his rebellious palate
steadily refused to relish the dainties prepared
for it. Science must be made to
triumph, however, and the little doctor
gallantly charged these "What is It's"
of cookery and finished the last morsel
under furious protest of stomach.

Somewhat comforted by the meal,
and seeing that the clouds had given
place to a clear sky, the philosophers
resumed their dressing gowns, woefully
shrunken by the wetting and drying
they had received, and having liberally
paid their hostess, started on the
homeward road; concluding that they
had seen enough for one day. They
were in the very poorest condition for
a long walk, for their theories, so far[132]
from making them any happier, had
produced only ill effects. Dr. Sheepshanks'
healthful exercise had given
them all stitches in the sides, and aches
in the back; Dr. Smelfungus's knowledge
of botany had betrayed them
into such excesses of melon alias turnip
eating, that various queer doublings
up in the epigastric region began
to make themselves apparent; the
natural philosophy, which had led Dr.
Van Noostile and his good friends to
parade along the middle of the road
in the sun, had given them furious
headaches; and, to crown all, Dr. Skihi
now made the most brilliant proposal
of anybody.

Our good doctor was evidently
brimming, one might say creaming,[133]
over with the milk of human kindness;
beyond a possible doubt he was about
to propound a discovery of benefit to
the whole world. His bald head
beamed benevolence, overflowing beneficence
to all mankind radiated from
the very tails of his dressing gown as
he cried:

"My dear friends, you are all too
tired to walk home now, ain't you?
You would like to get there before
you could say 'Jack Robinson'       now,
wouldn't you? and if I were to accomplish
that happy end, you could never
be grateful enough       now, could you?"

"Certainly not!" exclaimed the
advocate of exercise, who wished from
his inmost soul, either that he had
taken less turnip, or that the famous[134]
seven league boots were on his legs at
that moment.

"Then all you have to do," cried
Dr. Skihi with sparkling eyes, "is to get
in a convenient posture; allow me to
set off this retort of mine behind
you       " here he produced a "glass
concern" from a side pocket, to the
horror of his friends       "and heigh,
presto! you will find yourself flying
home like a skyrocket"       

"And coming down like the
stick!" gasped Dr. Smelfungus, retiring
in a hurry, for the tails of his
dressing gown and the gas retort of
Dr. Skihi were in inconvenient proximity.

Dr. Skihi vouchsafed not another
word, but with an air of indescribable[135]
dignity adjusted the retort, took out
a cork       and       but words fail me to
describe the catastrophe! Before Dr.
Mumbudget could rush forward to
prevent it, the gas had come in contact
with the air, become inflamed instantly,
and sent Dr. Skihi whirling
above the heads of his friends!

Vesuvius in eruption, coal mines on
fire, mad bulls in the full rush, and
crackers exploding in a barrel, rushed
wildly through the heads of our philosophers,
and when, finally, the rocket-riding
doctor was discharged on a
hayrick, the only person who retained
sufficient presence of mind to go and
pick him up was Mumbudget.

Poor Dr. Skihi! The victim to science
remained insensible for some[136]
time; and when he finally recovered
his consciousness, could not at first be
persuaded that he was not in innumerable
pieces. When he was, at last,
enabled to walk on, it was discovered
that while they were experimenting
they had lost their way, and might be
close to home or in the middle of
Kamtschatka for all they knew of the
road. It was again Mumbudget who
helped them out of this difficulty, by
speaking for the third time that day;
and this third remark of the sage was
as much to the point as the two first.
"Ask somebody!" propounded Mumbudget,
and after hobbling miserably
along for some time, this somebody
turned up in the person of a very
small, ragged, dirty urchin; and under[137]
the guidance of this contemptible
little snipe did our prodigies of wisdom
arrive at last at the abode of
Science and Knowledge!

As they entered the hall, Dr. Smelfungus,
with an admiring glance at the
speechless Mumbudget, exclaimed,
"After all, gentlemen, there must be
a science far higher than ours, since
we, with all our knowledge, find practical
life a matter of such difficulty.
Only one man, it appears, is master of
it, and there he stands!" and he made
a low bow to Mumbudget, who returned
it by another, without a word
of reply.

Dr. Skihi, at this, glanced with
profound contempt at Smelfungus, and
gave a "hum!" that was echoed by[138]
the professor of health and him of
natural science; then raising himself
on the tips of his toes, and seesawing
up and down at every word, he inquired,
superciliously, "And pray, sir,
may I ask, in the name of my scientific
friends, what branch of science
you profess, which is superior to every
other?"

Mumbudget looked with a quiet
smile at the excited little doctor, and
replied, calmly:

"Gentlemen, I am the professor of
Common Sense."

At this reply, the learned friends,
Smelfungus not excepted, presented
a series of remarkably open countenances,
as respected eyes and mouths,
while Dr. Mumbudget went on:[139]

"Chemistry, Botany, Natural Philosophy,
and Hygienics       all put together,
gentlemen, have failed to ensure us
one day of rational enjoyment or ease;
for all these sciences are pure absurdities,
unless they are put in the hands
of men who are governed by the
wholesome dictates of common sense.
My wise philosophers, will you come
to school to me?"

The doctors gazed a moment yet;
first at the proposer of this new doctrine,
then at each other; and then,
all rushing forward at once, they seized
his hands.

"You are right, my dear Mumbudget!"
they exclaimed in a breath;
"with all our science we are most
greatly in want of common sense![140]
Open your school at once; we will be
the first to join its classes, and celebrate
the triumph of Reason over
Philosophy!"

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
