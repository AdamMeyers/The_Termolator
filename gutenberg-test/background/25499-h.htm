<h2>THE GREAT WHITE QUEEN.</h2>

<hr />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<h3>A ROMANCE!</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is a curious story, full of exciting adventures, extraordinary
discoveries, and mysteries amazing.</p>

<p>Strange, too, that I, Richard Scarsmere, who, when
at school hated geography as bitterly as I did algebraic
problems, should even now, while just out of my teens,
be thus enabled to write down this record of a perilous
journey through a land known only by name to geographers,
a vast region wherein no stranger had ever before
set foot.</p>

<p>The face of the earth is well explored now-a-days, yet
it has remained for me to discover and traverse one of
the very few unknown countries, and to give the bald-headed
old fogies of the Royal Geographical Society a
lesson in the science that I once abominated.</p>

<p>I have witnessed with my own eyes the mysteries of
Mo. I have seen the Great White Queen!</p>

<p>Three years ago I had as little expectation of emulating
the intrepidity of Stanley as I had of usurping the
throne of England. An orphan, both of whose parents
had been drowned in a yachting accident in the Solent
and whose elder brother succeeded to the estate, I was
left in the care of a maternal uncle, a regular martinet,
who sent me for several long and dreary years to Dr.
Tregear's well-known Grammar-school at Eastbourne,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2"></a>[<a href="./images/2.png">2</a>]</span>
and had given me to understand that I should
eventually enter his office in London. Briefly, I was,
when old enough, to follow the prosaic and ill-paid
avocation of clerk. But for a combination of circumstances,
I should have, by this time, budded into
one of those silk-hatted, patent-booted, milk-and-bun
lunchers who sit on their high perches and drive a pen
from ten till four at a salary of sixteen shillings weekly.
Such was the calling my relative thought good enough
for me, although his own sons were being trained for
professional careers. In his own estimation all his ideas
were noble and his generosity unbounded; but not in
mine.</p>

<p>But this is not a school story, although its preparatory
scenes take place at school. Some preparatory scenes
must take place at school; but the drama generally
terminates on the broader stage of the world. Who
cares for a rehearsal, save those who have taken part in
it? I vow, if I had never been at Tregear's I would
skip the very mention of his name. As it is, however,
I often sigh to see the shadow of the elms clustering
around the playground, to watch the moonbeans illumine
the ivied wall opposite the dormitory window. I often
dream that I am back again, a C&aelig;sar-hating pupil.</p>

<p>Dr. Tregear, commonly called "Old Trigger," lived
at Upperton, a suburb of Eastbourne, and had accommodation
for seventy boys, but during the whole time
I remained there we never had more than fifty. His
advertisements in local and London papers offering
"Commercial training for thirty guineas including
laundress and books. Bracing air, gravel soil, diet
best and unlimited. Reduction for brothers," were
glowing enough, but they never whipped up business<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"></a>[<a href="./images/3.png">3</a>]</span>
sufficiently to attract the required number of boarders.
Nevertheless, I must admit that old Trigger, with all
his faults and severity, was really good-hearted. He
was a little sniffing, rasping man, with small, spare,
feeble, bent figure; mean irregular features badly
arranged round a formidable bent, broken red nose;
thin straggling grey hair and long grey mutton-chop
whiskers; constantly blinking little eyes and very
assertive, energetic manners. He had a constant air
of objecting to everything and everybody on principle.
Knowing that I was an orphan he sometimes took me
aside and gave me sound fatherly advice which I have
since remembered, and am now beginning to appreciate.
His wife, too, was a kindly motherly woman who,
because being practically homeless I was often compelled
to spend my holidays at school, seemed better disposed
towards me than to the majority of the other fellows.</p>

<p>Yes, I got on famously at Trigger's. Known by the
abbreviated appellation of "Scars," I enjoyed a popularity
that was gratifying, and, bar one or two sneaks,
there was not one who would not do me a good turn
when I wanted it. The sneaks were outsiders, and
although we did not reckon them when we spoke of
"the school," it must not be imagined that we forgot
to bring them into our calculations in each conspiracy
of devilment, nor to fasten upon them the consequences
of our practical jokes.</p>

<p>My best friend was a mystery. His name was Omar
Sanom, a thin spare chap with black piercing eyes set
rather closely together, short crisp hair and a complexion
of a slightly yellowish hue. I had been at
Trigger's about twelve months and was thirteen when
he arrived. I well remember that day. Accompanied<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a>[<a href="./images/4.png">4</a>]</span>
by a tall, dark-faced man of decided negroid type who
appeared to be ill at ease in European clothes, he was
shown into the Doctor's study, where a long consultation
took place. Meanwhile among the fellows much
speculation was rife as to who the stranger was, the
popular opinion being that Trigger should not open
his place to "savages," and that if he came we would
at once conspire to make his life unbearable and send
him to Coventry.</p>

<p>An hour passed and listeners at the keyhole of the
Doctor's door could only hear mumbling, as if the
negotiations were being carried on in the strictest
secrecy. Presently, however, the black man wished
Trigger good-day, and much to everyone's disgust and
annoyance the yellow-faced stranger was brought in and
introduced to us as Omar Sanom, the new boy.</p>

<p>The mystery surrounding him was inscrutable. About
my own age, he spoke very little English and would,
in conversation, often drop unconsciously into his own
language, a strange one which none of the masters
understood or even knew its name. It seemed to me
composed mainly of p's and l's. To all our inquiries as
to the place of his birth or nationality he remained
dumb. Whence he had come we knew not; we were
only anxious to get rid of him.</p>

<p>I do not think Trigger knew very much about him.
That he paid very handsomely for his education I
do not doubt, for he was allowed privileges accorded
to no one else, one of which was that on Sundays when
we were marched to church he was allowed to go for a
walk instead, and during prayers he always stood aside
and looked on with superior air, as if pitying our
simplicity. His religion was not ours.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a>[<a href="./images/5.png">5</a>]</span>
For quite a month it was a subject of much discussion
as to which of the five continents Omar came from,
until one day, while giving a geography lesson the
master, who had taken the West Coast of Africa as his
subject, asked:</p>

<p>"Where does the Volta River empty itself?"</p>

<p>There was a dead silence that confessed ignorance.
We had heard of the Russian Volga, but never of the
Volta. Suddenly Omar, who stood next me, exclaimed
in his broken English:</p>

<p>"The Volta empties itself into the Gulf of Guinea.
I've been there."</p>

<p>"Quite correct," nodded the master approvingly,
while Baynes, the fellow on my left, whispered:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yellow-Face has been there! He's a Guinea Pig&mdash;see?"</p>

<p>I laughed and was punished in consequence, but the
suggestion of the witty Baynes being whispered round
the school was effective. From that moment the yellow-faced
mysterious foreigner was commonly known as "the
Guinea Pig."</p>

<p>We did our best to pump him and ascertain whether
he had been born in Guinea, but he carefully avoided
the subject. The information that he came from the
West Coast of Africa had evidently been given us quite
involuntarily. He had been asked a question about a
spot he knew intimately, and the temptation to exhibit
his superiority over us had proved too great.</p>

<p>Not only was his nationality a secret, but many of his
actions puzzled us considerably. As an instance, whenever
he drank anything, water, tea, or coffee, he never
lifted his cup to his lips before spilling a small quantity
upon the floor. If we had done this punishment would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a>[<a href="./images/6.png">6</a>]</span>
promptly have descended upon us, but the masters looked
on at his curious antics in silence.</p>

<p>Around his neck beneath his clothes he wore a sort of
necklet composed of a string of tiny bags of leather, in
which were sewn certain hard substances that could be
felt inside. Even in the dormitory he never removed
this, although plenty of chaff was directed towards him
in consequence of this extraordinary ornament. It was
popularly supposed that he came from some savage land,
and that when at home this string of leather bags was
about the only article of dress he wore.</p>

<p>If rather dull at school, he very soon picked up our
language with all its slang, and quickly came to the fore
in athletics. In running, swimming and rowing no one
could keep pace with him. On foot he was fleet as a
deer, and in the water could swim like a fish, while at
archery he was a dead shot. Within three months he
had lived down all the prejudices that had been engendered
by reason of his colour, and I confess that I
myself, who had at first regarded him with gravest suspicion,
now began to feel a friendliness towards him.
Once or twice, at considerable inconvenience to himself
he rendered me valuable services, and on one occasion
got me out of a serious scrape by taking the blame himself,
therefore within six months of his arrival we became
the firmest of chums. At work, as at play, we were
always together, and notwithstanding the popular feeling
being antagonistic to my close acquaintance with the
"Guinea Pig," I nevertheless knew from my own careful
observations that although a foreigner, half-savage he
might be, he was certainly true and loyal to his friends.</p>

<p>Once he fought. It was soon after we became
chums that he had a quarrel with the bully Baynes over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a>[<a href="./images/7.png">7</a>]</span>
the ownership of a catapult. Baynes, who was three
years older, heavier built and much taller, threatened to
thrash him. This threat was sufficient. Omar at once
challenged him, and the fight took place down in the
paddock behind a hedge, secure from Trigger's argus
eye. As the pair took off their coats one of the fellows
jokingly said&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Guinea Pig's a cannibal. He'll eat you, Baynes."</p>

<p>Everybody laughed, but to their astonishment within
five minutes our champion pugilist lay on the ground
with swollen eye and sanguinary nose, imploring for
mercy. That he could fight Omar quickly showed us,
and as he released the bully after giving him a sound
dressing as a cat would shake a rat, he turned to us and
with a laugh observed&mdash;</p>

<p>"My people are neither cowards nor cannibals. We
never fight unless threatened, but we never decline to
meet our enemies."</p>

<p>No one spoke. I helped him on with his coat, and
together we left the ground, while the partisans of Baynes
picked up their fallen champion and proceeded to make
him presentable.</p>

<p>Like myself, Omar seemed friendless, for when the
summer holidays came round both of us remained with
the Doctor and his wife, while the more fortunate ones
always went away to their homes. At first he seemed
downcast, but we spent all our time together, and Mrs.
Tregear, it must be admitted, did her best to make us
comfortable, allowing us to ramble where we felt inclined,
even surreptitiously supplying us with pocket-money.</p>

<p>It was strange, however, that I never could get Omar
to talk of himself. Confidential friends that we were,
in possession of each other's secrets, he spoke freely of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a>[<a href="./images/8.png">8</a>]</span>
everything except his past. That some remarkable
romance enveloped him I felt certain, yet by no endeavour
could I fathom the mystery.</p>

<p>Twice or thrice each year the elderly negro who had
first brought him to the school visited him, and they
were usually closeted a long time together. Perhaps
his sable-faced guardian on those occasions told him
news of his relatives; perhaps he gave him good advice.
Which, I know not. The man, known as Mr.
Makhana, was always very pleasant towards me, but
never communicative. Yet he made up for that defect
by once or twice leaving half-a-sovereign within my
ready palm. He appeared suddenly without warning,
and left again, even Omar himself being unaware
where he dwelt.</p>

<p>Truly my friend was a mystery. Who he was, or
whence he had come, was a secret.</p>

<h3>OMAR'S SLAVE.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Omar</span> had been at Trigger's a little over two years when
a strange incident occurred. We were then both aged
about sixteen, he a few months older than myself. The
summer holidays had come round again. I had a month
ago visited my uncle in London, and he had given me
to understand that after next term I should leave
school and commence life in the City. He took me to
his warehouse in Thames Street and showed me the gas-lit
cellar wherein his clerks were busy entering goods and
calling out long columns of amounts. The prospect was
certainly not inviting, for I was never good at arithmetic,
and to spend one's days in a place wherein never a ray<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a>[<a href="./images/9.png">9</a>]</span>
of sunshine entered was to my mind the worst existence
to which one could be condemned.</p>

<p>When I returned I confessed my misgivings to Omar,
who sympathised with me, and we had many long chats
upon the situation as during the six weeks we wandered
daily by the sea. We cared little for the Grand Parade,
with its line of garish hotels, tawdry boarding-houses and
stucco-fronted villas, and the crowd of promenaders did
not interest us. Seldom even we went on the pier,
except to swim. Our favourite walks were away in the
country through Willingdon to Polegate, over Beachy
Head, returning through East Dean to Litlington and
its famed tea-garden, or across Pevensey Levels to
Wartling, for we always preferred the more unfrequented
ways. One day, when I was more than usually gloomy
over the prospect of drudgery under my close-fisted
relative, my friend said to me cheerfully:</p>

<p>"Come, Scars, don't make yourself miserable about it.
My people have a saying that a smile is the only weapon
one can use to combat misfortune, and I think it's true.
We have yet a few months more together before you
leave. In life our ways will lie a long way apart. You
will become a trader in your great city, while I shall
leave soon, I expect, to&mdash;&mdash;" and he paused.</p>

<p>"To do what?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"To go back to my own people, perhaps," he answered
mechanically. "Perhaps I shall remain here and wait, I
know not."</p>

<p>"Wait for what?"</p>

<p>"Wait until I receive orders to return," he answered.
"Ah, you don't know what a strange life mine has been,
Scars," he added a moment later in a confidential tone.
"I have never told you of myself for the simple reason<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a>[<a href="./images/10.png">10</a>]</span>
that silence is best. We are friends; I hope we shall be
friends always, even though my enemies seek to despise
me because I am not quite white like them. But loyalty
is one of the cherished traditions of my people, and now
that during two years our friendship has been firmly
established I trust nothing will ever occur to interrupt it."</p>

<p>"I take no heed of your enemies, Omar," I said.
"You have proved yourself genuine, and the question of
colour, race, or creed has nothing to do with it."</p>

<p>"Perhaps creed has," he exclaimed rather sadly. "But
I make no pretence of being what I am not. Your
religion interests me, although, as you know, I have
never been taught the belief you have. My gods are in
the air, in the trees, in the sky. I believe what I have
been taught; I pray in silence and the great god Zomara
hears me even though I am separated from my race by
yonder great ocean. Yet I sometimes think I cannot
act as you white people do, that, after all, what my
enemies say is true. I am still what you term a savage,
although wearing the clothes of your civilization."</p>

<p>"Though a man be a pagan he may still be a friend,"
I said.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am at least your friend," he said. "My only
regret is that your uncle will part us in a few months.
Still, in years to come we shall remember each other,
and you will at least have a passing thought for Omar,
the Guinea Pig," he added, laughing.</p>

<p>I smiled too, but I noticed that although he endeavoured
to appear gay, his happiness was feigned, and
there was in his dark eyes a look of unutterable sadness.
Our conversation drifted to a local cricket match that
was to be played on the morrow, and soon the gloomy
thoughts that seemed to possess him were dispelled.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a>[<a href="./images/11.png">11</a>]</span>
It was on the same sunny afternoon, however, that a
curious incident occurred which was responsible for
altering the steady prosaic course of our lives. The
most trifling incidents change the current of a life, and
the smallest events are sufficient to alter history altogether.
Through the blazing August afternoon we had
walked beyond Meads, mounted Beachy Head, passed
the lighthouse at Belle Tout and descended to the beach
at a point known as the Seven Sisters. The sky was
cloudless, the sea like glass, and during that long walk
without shelter from the sun's rays I had been compelled
to halt once or twice and mop my face with my handkerchief.
Yet without fatigue, without the slightest
apparent effort, and still feeling cool, Omar walked on,
smiling at the manner in which the unusual heat affected
me, saying:</p>

<p>"Ah! It is not hot here. You might grumble at the
heat if the sun were as powerful as it is in my country."</p>

<p>When we descended to the beach and threw ourselves
down under the shadow of the high white cliffs to rest, I
saw there was no one about and suggested a swim. It
was against old Trigger's orders, nevertheless the calm,
cool water as it lazily lapped the sand proved too tempting,
and very shortly we had plunged in and were enjoying
ourselves. Omar left the water first, and presently
I saw while he was dressing the figure of a tallish,
muscular man attired in black and wearing a silk hat
approaching him. As I watched, wondering what
business the stranger could have with my companion, I
saw that when they met Omar greeted him in native
fashion by snapping fingers, as he had often done playfully
to me. Whoever he might be, the stranger was
unexpected, and judging from the manner in which he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a>[<a href="./images/12.png">12</a>]</span>
had been received, a welcome visitor. I was not near
enough to distinguish the features of the newcomer, but
remembering that I had been in the water long enough,
I struck out for the shore, and presently walked up the
beach towards them.</p>

<p>Omar had dressed, and was in earnest conversation
with a gigantic negro of even darker complexion than
Mr. Makhana. Unconscious of my approach, for my
feet fell noiselessly upon the sand, he was speaking
rapidly in his own language, while the man who had
approached him stood listening in meek, submissive
attitude. Then, for the first time, I noticed that my
friend held in his hand a grotesquely carved stick that
had apparently been presented by the new-comer as his
credential, together with a scrap of parchment whereon
some curious signs, something like Arabic, were written.
While Omar addressed him he bowed low from time to
time, murmuring some strange words that I could not
catch, but which were evidently intended to assure my
friend that he was his humble servant.</p>

<p>In spare moments Omar had taught me a good deal
of his language. Indeed, such a ready pupil had I been
that frequently when we did not desire the other
fellows to understand our conversation we spoke in his
tongue. But of what he was saying to this stranger, I
could only understand one or two words and they conveyed
to me no meaning. The negro was a veritable
giant in stature, showily dressed, with one of those
gaudily-coloured neckties that delight the heart of
Africans, while on his fat brown hand was a large ring
of very light-coloured metal that looked suspiciously
like brass. His boots were new, and of enormous size,
but as he stood he shifted uneasily from one foot to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a>[<a href="./images/13.png">13</a>]</span>
other, showing that he was far from comfortable in his
civilized habiliments.</p>

<p>Without approaching closer I picked up my things
and dressed rapidly, then walked forward to join my
companion.</p>

<p>"Scars!" he cried, as soon as I stood before him.
"I had quite forgotten you. This is my mother's confidential
adviser, Kouaga."</p>

<p>Then, turning to the grinning ebon-faced giant he
uttered some rapid words in his own language and told
him my name, whereupon he snapped fingers in true
native fashion, the negro showing an even set of white
teeth as an expression of pleasure passed over his
countenance.</p>

<p>"We little thought that we were being watched this
afternoon," Omar said to me, smiling and throwing himself
down upon the sand, an example followed by the
negro and myself. "It seems that Kouaga arrived in
Eastbourne this morning, but there are strong reasons
why none should know that he has seen me. Therefore
he followed me here to hold palaver at a spot where we
should not be observed."</p>

<p>"You have a letter, I see."</p>

<p>"Yes," he said slowly, re-reading the strange lines of
hieroglyphics. "The news it contains necessitates me
leaving for Africa immediately."</p>

<p>"For Africa!" I cried dismayed. "Are you going?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I must. It is imperative."</p>

<p>"Then I shall lose you earlier than I anticipated," I
observed with heart-felt sorrow at the prospect of parting
with my only chum. "It is true, as you predicted,
our lives lie very far apart."</p>

<p>The negro lifted his hat from his brow as if its weight<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a>[<a href="./images/14.png">14</a>]</span>
oppressed him, then turning to me, said slowly and with
distinctness in his own tongue:</p>

<p>"I bring the words of the mighty Naya unto her son.
None dare disobey her commands on pain of death.
She is a ruler above all rulers; before her armed
men monarchs bow the knee, at her frown nations
tremble. In order to bring the palaver she would make
with her son I have journeyed for three moons by land
and sea to reach him and deliver the royal staff in
secret. I have done my duty. It is for Omar to
obey. Kouaga has spoken."</p>

<p>"Let me briefly explain, Scarsmere," my friend interrupted.
"Until the present I have been compelled to
keep my identity a secret, for truth to tell, there is a plot
against our dynasty, and I fear assassination."</p>

<p>"Your dynasty!" I cried amazed. "Are your people
kings and queens?"</p>

<p>"They are," he answered. "I am the last descendant
of the great Sanoms of Mo, the powerful rulers who for
a thousand years have held our country against all its
enemies, Mahommedan, Pagan or Christian. I am the
Prince of Mo."</p>

<p>"But where is Mo?" I asked. "I have never heard
of it."</p>

<p>"I am not surprised," he said. "No stranger has
entered it, or ever will, for it is unapproachable and well-guarded.
One intrepid white man ventured a year ago
to ascend to the grass plateau that forms its southern
boundary, but he was expelled immediately on pain of
death. My country, known to the neighbouring tribes
as the Land Beyond the Clouds, lies many weeks' journey
from the sea in the vast region within the bend of the
great Niger river, north of Upper Guinea, and is coter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a>[<a href="./images/15.png">15</a>]</span>minous
with the states of Gurunsi and Kipirsi on the
west, with Yatenga on the north-west, with Jilgodi,
Aribinda, and Libtako on the north, with Gurma on the
east, and with the Nampursi district of Gurunsi on the
south."</p>

<p>"The names have no meaning for me," I said. "But
the fact that you are an actual Prince is astounding."</p>

<p>With his hands clasped behind his head, he flung
himself back upon the sand, laughing heartily.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "I didn't want to parade my royal
ancestry, neither do I want to now. I only tell you in
confidence, and in order that you shall understand why
I am compelled to return. During the past ten years
there have been many dissensions among the people,
fostered by the enemies of our country, with a view to
depose the reigning dynasty. Three years ago a dastardly
plot was discovered to murder my mother and
myself, seize the palace, and massacre its inmates.
Fortunately it was frustrated, but my mother deemed it
best to send me secretly out of the country, for I am sole
heir to the throne, and if the conspirators killed me,
our dynasty must end. Therefore Makhana, my mother's
secret agent, who purchases our arms and ammunition in
England and conducts all trade we have with civilized
countries, brought me hither, and I have since been in
hiding."</p>

<p>"But Makhana has been bribed by our enemies,"
exclaimed the big negro, who had been eagerly listening
to our conversation, but understanding no word of it
save the mention of Makhana's name. Turning to
Omar he added: "Makhana will, if he obtains a chance,
kill you. Be warned in time against him. It has been
ascertained that he supplied the men of Moloto with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a>[<a href="./images/16.png">16</a>]</span>
forty cases of rifles, and that he has given his pledge
that you shall never return to Africa. Therefore obey
the injunction of my royal mistress, the great Naya, and
leave with me secretly."</p>

<p>"Without seeing Makhana?" asked Omar.</p>

<p>"Yes," the black-faced man replied. "He must not
know, or the plans of the Naya may be thwarted. Our
enemies have arranged to strike their blow three moons
from now, but ere that we shall be back in Mo, and they
will find that they go only to their graves. Kouaga has
made fetish for the son of his royal mistress, and has
come to him bearing the stick."</p>

<p>"What does the letter say?" I asked Omar, noticing
him reading it again.</p>

<p>"It is brief enough, and reads as follows," he said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"'<i>Know, O my son Omar, that I send my stick unto
thee by our trusty Kouaga. Return unto Mo on the
wings of haste, for our throne is threatened and thy
presence can avert our overthrow. Tarry not in the
country of the white men, but let thy face illuminate the
darkness of my life ere I go to the tomb of my ancestors.</i></p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Naya.</span><ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: added missing quotation marks">'"</ins></p></div>

<p>I glanced at the scrap of parchment, and saw appended
a truly regal seal.</p>

<p>"And shall you go?" I asked with sorrow.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;if you will accompany me."</p>

<p>"Accompany you!" I cried. "How can I? I have
no money to go to Africa, besides&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Besides what?" he answered smiling. "Kouaga
has money sufficient to pay both our passages. Remember,
I am Prince of Mo, and this man is my slave.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a>[<a href="./images/17.png">17</a>]</span>
If I command him to take you with me he will obey.
Will you go?"</p>

<p>The prospect of adventure in an unknown land was
indeed enticing. In a few brief words he recalled my
dismal forebodings of the life in an underground office
in London, and contrasted it with a free existence in a
fertile and abundant land, where I should be the guest
and perhaps an official of its ruler. He urged me most
strongly to go as his companion, and in conclusion said:</p>

<p>"Your presence in Mo will be unique, for you will
be the first stranger who has ever set foot within its
capital."</p>

<p>"But your mother may object to me, as she did to the
entrance of the white man of whom you just now spoke."</p>

<p>"Ah! he came to make trade palaver. You are my
friend and confidant," he said.</p>

<p>"Then you suggest that we should both leave Eastbourne
at once, travel with Kouaga to Liverpool and
embark for Africa without returning to Trigger's, or
saying a word to anyone?"</p>

<p>"We must. If we announce our intention of going we
are certain to be delayed, and as the steamers leave only
once a month, delay may be fatal to my mother's plans."</p>

<p>As he briefly explained to Kouaga that he had invited
me to accompany him I saw that companion to an
African prince would be a much more genial occupation
than calculating sums in a gas-lit cellar; therefore, fired
by the pleasant picture he placed before me, I resolved
to accept his invitation.</p>

<p>"Very well, Omar," I said, trying to suppress the
excitement that rose within me. "We are friends, and
where you go I will go also."</p>

<p>Delighted at my decision my friend sprang to his feet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a>[<a href="./images/18.png">18</a>]</span>
with a cry of joy, and we all three snapped fingers, after
which we each took a handful of dry sand and by
Omar's instructions placed it in one heap upon a rock.
Then, having first mumbled something over his amulets,
he quickly stirred the heap of sand with his finger, saying:</p>

<p>"As these grains of sand cannot be divided, so cannot
the bonds of friendship uniting Omar, Prince of Mo,
with Scarsmere and Kouaga, be rent asunder. Omar
has spoken."</p>



<hr class="full" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3>OUTWARD BOUND.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">How</span>, trembling lest we should be discovered, we left
Eastbourne by train two hours later&mdash;Kouaga joining
the train at Polegate so as to avoid notice&mdash;how the
Grand Vizier of Mo purchased our travelling necessities
in London; how we travelled to Liverpool by the night
mail, and how we embarked upon the steamer <i>Gambia</i>,
it is unnecessary to relate in detail. Suffice it to say
that within twenty-four hours of meeting the big negro
we were safely on board the splendid mail-steamer where
everything was spick and span. Kouaga had engaged
a cabin for our exclusive use, and the captain himself
had evidently ascertained that Omar was a person of
importance, for in passing us on deck he paused to chat
affably, and express a hope that we should find the
voyage a pleasant one.</p>

<p>"Your coloured servant has told me your destination,"
he said, addressing Omar. "We can't land you there
on account of the surf, but I understand a boat from
shore will be on the look-out. If it isn't, well, you'll
have to go on to Cape Coast Castle."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a>[<a href="./images/19.png">19</a>]</span>
"The boat will be in readiness," Omar said smiling.
"If it isn't, those in charge will pay dearly for it. You
know what I mean."</p>

<p>The Captain laughed, drew his finger across his
throat, and nodded.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said. "I've heard that in your country
life is held cheap. I fancy I'd rather be on my bridge
than a resident in the Naya's capital. But I see I'm
wanted. Good-bye," and he hurried away to shout some
order to the men who were busy stowing the last portion
of the cargo.</p>

<p>As we leaned over the rail watching the bustle on
board the steam tender that lay bobbing up and down
at our side, we contemplated the consternation of old
Trigger when he found us missing. No doubt a hue
and cry would be at once raised, but as several persons
we knew had seen us walking towards the Belle Tout,
it would, without a doubt, be surmised that we had been
drowned while bathing. The only thing we regretted
was that we had not left some portion of our clothing on
the beach to give verisimilitude to the suggestion. However,
we troubled ourselves not one whit about the past.
I was glad to escape from the doom of the gas-lit cellar,
and was looking forward with keen anticipation to a new
life in that mystic country, Africa.</p>

<p>At last there was shouting from the bridge, the
tender cast off, the bell in the engine-room gave four
strokes, the signal for full-speed ahead, and ere long we
were steaming past that clanging beacon the Bell Buoy,
and heading for the open sea. The breeze began to
whistle around us, the keen-eyed old pilot tightened his
scarf around his throat, and carefully we sped along past
the Skerries until we slowed off Holyhead, where he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a>[<a href="./images/20.png">20</a>]</span>
shook hands with the captain, and with a hearty "good-bye"
swung himself over the bulwarks into the heavy
old boat that had come alongside. Thus was severed
the last link that bound us to England.</p>

<p>Standing up in his boat he waved us a farewell, while
our captain, his hands behind him, took charge of the
ship and shouted an order.</p>

<p>Ting-ting-ting-ting sounded the bell below, and a
moment later we were moving away into the fast falling
night. For a long time we remained on deck with
Kouaga, watching the distant shore of Wales fade into
the banks of mist, while now and then a brilliant light
would flash its warning to us and then die out again as
suddenly as it had appeared. We had plenty of passengers
on board, mostly merchants and their families
going out to the "Coast," one or two Government officials,
engineers and prospectors, and during the first
night all seemed bustle and confusion. Stewards were
ordered here and there, loud complaints were heard on
every side, threats were made to report trivialities to the
captain, and altogether there was plenty to amuse us.</p>

<p>Next day, however, when we began to bow gracefully
to the heavy swell of the Atlantic the majority of the
grumblers were glad enough to seek the comfort and
privacy of their berths and to remain there, for during
the two days that followed the waves ran mountains high,
the wind howled, the bulkheads creaked and the vessel
made plunges so unexpectedly that to stand was
almost impossible. The great waves seemed to rush
upon us as we ploughed our way through them, sometimes
burying our bows in foam and at others
striking us and lifting us high up, the shock almost
causing us to stop. The roar of the tempest seemed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a>[<a href="./images/21.png">21</a>]</span>
deafening, the ship's bell tolled with regularity, but no
one appeared in the saloon, and it seemed as if the cook
in his galley had little, if anything, to do.</p>

<p>"Never mind," I heard one officer say to another,
as they lounged outside their cabins off duty. "It'll
give 'em their sea legs, and the weather will be all right
the other side of the Bay."</p>

<p>Both laughed. Sailors seem to enjoy the discomforts
of passengers.</p>

<p>During those two days I think we were the only
passengers who spent the whole day on deck. Kouaga
was a poor sailor and was in his bunk horribly bad.
When we visited him the whites of his eyes seemed perfectly
green.</p>

<p>This was my first taste of a storm, and I must confess
that I did not enjoy it. I was not ill, but experienced
a feeling the reverse of comfortable. Through all,
however, I congratulated myself that I had actually
left England, and was about to commence life in a new
land. The officer whose words I had overheard proved a
prophet, for after three days of bad weather we ran into
blue water, calm as a mill-pond, the sun shone out warm
and bright, as quickly as the spirits of the passengers had
fallen they rose again, and a round of gaiety commenced
that continued unbroken until we left the vessel.</p>

<p>We touched at Funchal, a pretty town of white villas
half hidden by the surrounding greenery, and with others
went ashore, but we were not there more than a couple
of hours, for soon the Blue-Peter was run to our masthead
as signal that the ship was about to sail, and we
were compelled to re-embark. Then a gun was fired on
board, the crowd of small craft around us that had put
out for the purpose of selling the passengers bananas,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a>[<a href="./images/22.png">22</a>]</span>
live birds, etc., sheered off, and very soon we had restarted
on our southward voyage.</p>

<p>Ere long, having passed the snow-capped peak of
Teneriffe of which we had heard so much at Trigger's,
we entered the region of the trade-winds, and the steamer,
aided by its sails that were now spread, held rapidly on
its course rounding Cape Verd. For a day we
anchored off Bathurst, then steamed away past the many
rocky islands off the coast of Guinea until we touched
Free Town, the capital of that unhealthy British colony
Sierra Leone. Anchoring there, we discharged some
cargo, resuming our voyage in a calm sea and perfect
weather, and carefully avoiding the dangerous shoals of
St. Ann, we passed within sight of Sherboro Island, a
British possession, and also sighted Cape Mount, which
Omar told me was in the independent republic of
Liberia. For several days after this we remained out of
sight of land until one afternoon, just about tea-time,
the captain came up to us, saying&mdash;</p>

<p>"We shall make the mouth of the Lahou River in
about two hours, so you'd better be prepared to leave.
I'll keep a good look-out for your boat. Have you
had a pleasant voyage?"</p>

<p>"Very," we both replied in one voice.</p>

<p>"Glad of that," he said, and turning to Omar added,
"you'll look after me if ever I get up country as far as
Mo, won't you?"</p>

<p>"Of course," my friend answered laughing. "If you
come you shall have a right royal welcome. Come at
any time. You'll have nothing to fear when once inside
the borders of my mother's country."</p>

<p>"Ah, well. Perhaps I'll come some day, when I retire
on my pension and set up as an African chief&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a>[<a href="./images/23.png">23</a>]</span>
We all laughed, and he ascended the steps again to
the bridge.</p>

<p>Kouaga, in the meantime, was busy collecting our
things, giving gratuities to the stewards, and otherwise
making preparations to leave. For over two hours we
eagerly watched in the direction of the shore, being
assisted by a crowd of passengers who had by this time
learnt that we were to be taken off.</p>

<p>The shore which slowly came into view as our eager
eyes scanned the horizon was the Ivory Coast, but the
sun sank in a glorious blaze of crimson, and dusk crept
on, yet the captain, whose glasses continually swept the
sea, could distinguish no boat approaching us.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid," he shouted to us from the bridge, "their
look-out is not well kept. We'll have to take you along
to Cape Coast, after all."</p>

<p>"Why not fire a gun, Captain?" suggested Kouaga,
his words being interpreted by Omar.</p>

<p>"Very well," he answered, and turning to the officer,
he gave orders that the signal gun should be fired three
times at intervals.</p>

<p>Presently there was a puff of white smoke and the
first loud report rang out, making the vessel quiver beneath
us. We waited, listening, but there was no
response. The light quickly faded, night cast her veil of
darkness over the sea, but we still stood in for the coast.</p>

<p>Again, about half-past nine, the gun belched forth a
tongue of flame, and the report sounded far over the
silent waters. All was excitement on deck, for it was a
matter of speculation whether an answering shout or
gunshot could be heard above the roar and throbbing of
the engines. Ten, eleven o'clock passed, and presently
the third gun was exploded so suddenly that the ladies<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a>[<a href="./images/24.png">24</a>]</span>
were startled. Again we listened, but could hear
nothing. Kouaga fumed and cursed the evil-spirit for
our misfortune, while Omar, finding that we were to be
taken to Cape Coast Castle, imparted to me his fear that
the fortnight's delay it must necessarily entail, would be
fatal to his mother's plans.</p>

<p>We were hanging over the taffrail together gazing
moodily into the darkness, having given up all hope of
getting ashore at the Lahou River, when suddenly about
half a mile from us we saw a flash, and the report of a rifle
reached us quite distinctly, followed by distant shouting.</p>

<p>"There they are!" cried Omar excitedly. "They've
hailed us at last!"</p>

<p>But ere the words had fallen from his lips we heard
the bell in the engine-room ringing, and next second the
steam was shut off and we gradually hove to.</p>

<p>Kouaga was at our side almost immediately, and we
found ourselves surrounded by passengers taking leave
of us. Our boxes were brought up by a couple of sailors,
and after about a quarter of an hour's wait, during
which time the vessel rose and fell with the swell, the
craft that had hailed us loomed up slowly in the darkness,
amid the excited jabber of her demoniac-looking crew.</p>

<p>She was a large native vessel, brig-rigged, and as
dirty and forbidding-looking a craft as you could well see
anywhere. Kouaga hailed one of the black, half-clad
men on board, receiving a cheery answer, and presently,
having taken leave of the captain and those around us,
we climbed over the bulwarks and sprang upon the
deck of the mysterious ship.</p>

<p>As Omar alighted the whole crew made obeisance to
him, afterwards crowding around me, examining me by
the lurid light of the torches they had ignited.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a>[<a href="./images/25.png">25</a>]</span>
Very quickly, however, several boxes belonging to
Kouaga were lowered, the moorings were cast off, and
slowly the great mail steamer with its long line of
brilliantly-lit ports looking picturesque in the night,
moved onward.</p>

<p>"Good-bye," shouted a voice from the steamer.</p>

<p>"Good-bye," I responded, and as the steamer's bell
again rang out, "full speed ahead," I knew that the last
tie that bound us to European civilization was severed.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3>A STRANGE PROMISE.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">By</span> the light of the flambeaux the sleek, black, oily-looking
natives managed their clumsy craft, which,
dipping suddenly now and then, shipped great seas,
compelling us to hang on for life. The sails creaked
and groaned as they bent to the wind, speeding on
in the darkness towards the mainland of Africa. To be
transferred to such a ship, which I more than suspected
was a slaver, was a complete change after the clean,
well-ordered Liverpool liner, and I must confess that,
had we not been in charge of Kouaga, I should have
feared to trust myself among that shouting cut-throat
crew of grinning blacks. Clinging to a rope I stood
watching the strange scene, rendered more weird by the
flickering uncertain light of the torches falling upon the
swarm of natives who manned the craft.</p>

<p>"Are these your mother's people?" I inquired of Omar.</p>

<p>"Some are. I recognize several as our slaves, the remainder
are Sanwi, or natives of the coast. Our slaves,
I suppose, have been sent down to be our carriers."</p>

<p>"Judging from the manner in which they crawl about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a>[<a href="./images/26.png">26</a>]</span>
this is, I should think, their first experience of the sea,"
I said.</p>

<p>"No doubt. Over a thousand English miles of
desert and almost impenetrable bush separates the sea
from our kingdom, therefore few, very few of our people
have seen it."</p>

<p>"They'll go back with some wonderful tales, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Yes. They will, on their return, be considered heroes
of travel, and their friends will hold feasts in their
honour."</p>

<p>As he finished speaking, however, our cumbrous craft
seemed suddenly to be lifted high out of the water, and
amid the unearthly yells of the whole crew we were
swept through a belt of foaming surf, until in a few
moments our keel slid upon the sand.</p>

<p>I prepared to leap down upon the beach, but in a
second half-a-dozen willing pairs of arms were ready to
assist me, and I alighted in the midst of a swarm of
half-clad, jabbering natives.</p>

<p>One of them, elbowing his way towards me, asked in
broken English:</p>

<p>"Massa have good voyage&mdash;eh?" whereupon the
others laughed heartily at hearing one of their number
speak the language of the white men. But Kouaga approached
uttering angry words, and from that moment
the same respect was paid to me as to Omar.</p>

<p>We found there was a small village where we landed,
otherwise the coast was wild and desolate. In an uncleanly
little hut to which we were taken when our
boxes were landed and the excitement had subsided, we
were regaled with various African delicacies, which at
first I did not find palatable, but which Omar devoured
with a relish, declaring that he had not enjoyed a meal so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a>[<a href="./images/27.png">27</a>]</span>
much since he had left "the Coast" for England. But
I did not care for yams, and the stewed monkey looked
suspiciously like a cooked human specimen. My geographical
knowledge was not so extensive as it might
have been, and I was not certain whether these natives
were not cannibals. Therefore I only made a pretence
of eating, and sat silently contemplating the strange
scene as we all sat upon the floor and took up our food
with our fingers. When we had concluded the feast a
native woman served Omar with some palm wine, which,
however, he did not drink, but poured it upon the ground
as an offering to the fetish for his safe return, and then
we threw ourselves upon the skins stretched out for us
and slept till dawn.</p>

<p>At sunrise I got up and went out. The place was, I
discovered, even more desolate than I had imagined.
Nothing met the eye in every direction but vast plains
of interminable sand, with hillocks here and there, also
of sand; no trees were to be seen, not even a shrub;
all was arid, dry and parched up with heat. The
village was merely an assemblage of a dozen miserable
mud huts, and so great was the monotony of the scene,
that the eye rested with positive pleasure on the dirty,
yellow-coloured craft in which we had landed during the
night. It had apparently once been whitewashed, but
had gradually assumed that tawny hue that always
characterises the African wilderness.</p>

<p>Again Omar and I were surrounded by the crowd of
fierce-looking barbarians, but the twenty stalwart carriers
sent down from Mo, apparently considering themselves
a superior race to these coast-dwellers, ordered them
away from our vicinity, at the same time preparing to
start for the interior. Under the direction of Kouaga,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a>[<a href="./images/28.png">28</a>]</span>
who had already abandoned his European attire and now
wore an Arab haick and white burnouse, the gang of
chattering men soon got their loads of food and merchandise
together&mdash;for the Grand Vizier had apparently
been purchasing a quantity of guns and ammunition in
England&mdash;hammocks were provided for all three of us
if we required them, and after a good meal we at length
set out, turning our backs upon the sea.</p>

<p>After descending the crest of a sand-hill we found
ourselves fairly in the desert. As far as we could see
away to the limitless horizon was sand&mdash;arid, parched
red-brown sand without a vestige of herbage. The wind
that was blowing carried grains of it, which filled one's
mouth and tasted hot and gritty; again, impalpable
atoms of sand were blown into the corners of one's eyes,
and, besides, this injury inflicted on the organ of vision
was calculated by no means to improve one's temper.
However, Omar told me that a beautiful and fruitful
land lay beyond, therefore we made light of these discomforts,
and, after a march of three days, during which
time we were baked by day by the merciless sun and
chilled at night by the heavy dews, we at last came
to the edge of the waterless wilderness, and remained
for some hours to rest.</p>

<p>My first glimpse of the "Dark Continent" was not
a rosy one. As a well-known writer has already pointed
out, life with a band of native carriers might for a few
days be a diverting experience if the climate were good
and if there was no immediate necessity for hurry. But
as things were it proved a powerful exercise, especially
when we commenced to traverse the almost impenetrable
bush by the native path, so narrow that two men could
not walk abreast.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a>[<a href="./images/29.png">29</a>]</span>
Across a great dismal swamp where high trees and
rank vegetation grew in wondrous profusion we wended
our way, day by day, amid the thick white mist that
seemed to continually envelop us. But it required a
little more than persuasion to make our carriers travel as
quickly as Kouaga liked. At early dawn while the hush
of night yet hung above the forest, our guide would rise,
stretch his giant limbs and kick up a sleeping trumpeter.
Then the tall, dark forest would echo with the boom of
an elephant-tusk horn, whose sound was all the more
weird since it came from between human jaws with which
the instrument was decorated. The crowd of blacks
got up readily enough, but it was merely in order to
light their fires and to settle down to eat plantains. At
length the horn would sound again, but produce no
result. The whole company still squatted, eating and
jabbering away, indifferent to every other sound. The
head man would be called for by Kouaga. "Why are
your men not ready? Know you not that the son of
the great Naya is with us?" With a deprecatory smile
the head-man would make some excuse. He had hurt
his foot, or had rheumatism, and therefore he, and consequently
his men, would be compelled to rest that
day. He would then be warned that if not ready to
march in five minutes, he would be carried captive into
Mo for the Great White Queen herself to deal with.
In five minutes he would return to Kouaga, saying that
if the Grand Vizier would only give the men a little
more salt with their "chop" (food) that evening, they
would march.</p>

<p>Kouaga would then become furious, soundly rating
everybody, and declare that the Naya herself should deal
with the whole lot as mutineers; whereupon, seeing all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a>[<a href="./images/30.png">30</a>]</span>
excuses for further halt unavailing, loads would be taken
up, and within a few moments the whole string of half-clad
natives would go laughing and singing on the forward
path.</p>

<p>The first belt of forest passed we entered a vast level
land covered with scrub, which Omar informed me was
the border of the Debendu territory. Proceeding
down a wide valley we came at length to the first inhabited
region. Every three or four miles we passed
through a native village&mdash;usually a single street of thirty
or forty houses. Each house consisted, as a rule, of
three or four small sheds, facing inwards, and forming a
tiny courtyard. The huts were on built-up platforms,
with hard walls of mud, and roofs thatched with palm-leaves,
while the front steps were faced with a kind of
red cement. In the middle of each centre of habitation
we found a tree with seats around it formed of untrimmed
logs, on which the elders and head-men of the village
would sit, smoke, and gravely discuss events. As we
left each village to plunge boldly onward through the
bush we would pass the village fetish ground, well defined
by the decaying bodies of lizards and birds, a grinning
human skull or two, broken pots and pieces of rag fluttering
in the wind, all offered as propitiation to the presiding
demon of the place, while away in the bush, behind
the houses, we saw the giant leaves of the plantain groves
that yielded the staple food of this primitive people.</p>

<p>Deeper and deeper we proceeded until we came into
regular forest scenery, where day after day we pushed our
way through solemn shady aisles of forest giants, whose
upper parts gleamed far above the dense undergrowth
in white pillars against the grey-blue sky. Sometimes
we strode down a picturesque sunny glade, and at others<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a>[<a href="./images/31.png">31</a>]</span>
struggled through deep dark crypts of massive bamboo
clumps. Here the noisome smell of decaying vegetation
nauseated us, for the air in those forest depths is
deadly. Beautiful scarlet wax-flowers would gleam high
among the dark-green foliage of the giant cotton-tree,
whose stem would be covered with orchids and ferns and
dense wreaths of creeper, while many other beautiful
blossoms flourished and faded unseen. In that dark
dismal place there was an absence of animal life. Sometimes,
however, by day we would hear the tuneful wail
of the finger-glass bird or an occasional robin would
chirrup, while at night great frogs croaked gloomily and
the sloth would shriek at our approach.</p>

<p>It was truly a toilsome, dispiriting march, as in single file
we pushed our way forward into the interior, and I confess
I soon began to tire of the monotony of the terrible
gloom. But to all my questions Omar would reply:</p>

<p>"Patience. In Africa we have violent contrasts
always. To-day we are toiling onward through a region of
eternal night, but when we have traversed the barrier that
shuts out our country from the influence of yours&mdash;then
you shall see. What you shall witness will amaze you."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h3>THE GIANT'S FINGER.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">For</span> quite three weeks we pushed forward through the
interminable forest until one day we came to a small
village beyond which lay a great broad river glistening in
the noon-day sun. It was the mighty Comoe. We had
entered the kingdom of Anno. In the village I saw
traces of human sacrifices, and Omar, in reply to a
question, told me that although these happy-looking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a>[<a href="./images/32.png">32</a>]</span>
natives were very skilful weavers and dyers who did a
brisk trade in <i>fu</i>, a bark cloth of excellent quality&mdash;which
I found afterwards they manufactured from the
bark of a tree apparently of the same species as the
much-talked-of <i>rokko</i> of Uganda&mdash;they nevertheless at
the death of a chief sacrificed some of his slaves to
"water the grave," while the memory of the departed was
also honoured with gross orgies which lasted till everything
eatable or drinkable in the village was consumed.</p>

<p>We only remained there a few hours, then embarked
in three large canoes that were moored to the bank
awaiting us. The chief of the village came to pay his
respects to Omar, as the son of a ruling monarch, and
presented us with food according to the usual custom.</p>

<p>Soon, amid the shouts of the excited villagers who
had all come down to see us start, our canoes were
pushed off, and the carriers, glad to be relieved of their
packs, took the paddles, and away we went gaily up the
centre of the winding river. Emerging as suddenly as
we had from the gloomy forest depths where no warmth
penetrated, into the blazing tropical sun was a sudden
change that almost overcame me, for as we rowed along
without shelter the rays beat down upon us mercilessly.</p>

<p>The banks were for the most part low, although it was
impossible to say what height they were because of the
lofty hedges of creeping plants which covered every inch
of ground from the water's edge to as high as fifty feet
above in some places, while behind them towered the
black-green forest with here and there bunches of brilliant
flowers or glimpses of countless grey trunks. Sometimes
these trees, pressing right up to the edge of the warm
sluggish water, grew horizontally to the length of fifty feet
over the river. Creepers, vines, whip-like calamus, twisting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a>[<a href="./images/33.png">33</a>]</span>
lianes and great serpent-like convolvuli grew in profusion
over everything, while the eye caught glimpses everywhere
of gorgeous clouds of insects, gaily-plumaged birds,
paraquets, and monkeys swinging in their shaded bowers.</p>

<p>Basking on the banks were crocodiles and hippopotami,
while the river itself swarmed with fish and water-snakes.
And over all rose the mist caused by heat and moisture,
the death-dealing miasma of that tropic world.</p>

<p>But all were in good spirits, for rowing was more
pleasurable than tramping in that dismal monotonous
primeval forest that rose on either side, therefore against
the broad, slowly-flowing waters our carriers bent to their
paddles, grinning and joking the while.</p>

<p>Throughout that day Kouaga sat near us, smoking and
thinking. Perhaps the responsibilities of State weighed
heavily upon him; perhaps he was contemplating with
trepidation the passage that would be necessary through
a country held by the enemies of Mo; at all events he
was morose and taciturn, his dark face bearing a strange,
stern look such as I had never before noticed.</p>

<p>During the weeks I had been travelling up country I
had embraced every opportunity of improving my knowledge
of the curious language spoken by Omar and his
mother's subjects, until I found I could understand a
large portion of a conversation and could even give
directions to our carriers in their own tongue.</p>

<p>Omar was in high spirits, eager, it seemed, to return
to his own people. He took a gun and some ammunition
from one of the cases that Kouaga had conveyed
from England and gave us an exhibition of his skill with
the rifle. He was a dead shot. I had no idea he could
aim so true. As we sped past in our canoe he would raise
his weapon from time to time and pick off a bird upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a>[<a href="./images/34.png">34</a>]</span>
the wing, or fire directly into the eye of some basking
animal, causing it to utter a roar, lash its tail and disappear
to die. He seldom missed, and the accuracy of his aim
elicited from the sable rowers low grunts of admiration.</p>

<p>A lazy and enjoyable week we thus spent in the ascent
of the Comoe, mostly through forest scenery or undulating
grass-lands. By day our rowers bent with rhythmic
music to their paddles, and at evening we would disembark,
cook our food, and afterwards with Kouaga and
my friend I would sleep in our canoe upon the heap of
leopard skins that formed our couches. Here we were
free from the pest of the myriad insects we had encountered
in the forest; and at night, under the brilliant
moon, the noble river and giant trees presented a fine
picture of solitary grandeur. Onward we pressed through
the flourishing country of the Jimini, where we saw many
prosperous villages of large roomy houses of rectangular
form and reed thatched, wide tracts under cultivation
with well-kept crops of cotton and rice. Everywhere we
passed, without opposition, and with expressions of good-will
from the natives.</p>

<p>One evening when the blood-red sun had sunk low in
the water behind us, we suddenly rounded a sharp bend of
the river and there burst upon us, rising on our right high
into the clouds, the great snow-capped crest of Mount
Komono. Near its base it was hidden by a bank of cloud,
but above all was clear and bright, so that the summit
had the appearance of being suspended in mid-air.</p>

<p>"The Giant's Finger at last!" cried Omar, jumping up
excitedly and pointing at the mountain. "We leave the
river a little higher up, and push again across the bush a
twelve days' journey until we come to the Volta, which
will take us forward to the boundary of Mo."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a>[<a href="./images/35.png">35</a>]</span>
"The Volta!" I cried, remembering the incident at
school when he had answered correctly the master's
question as to the estuary of that river, and had been
dubbed "the Guinea Pig." "Why could we not have
ascended it from the sea?"</p>

<p>"Because we should, by so doing, pass nearly the
whole distance through the country of Prempeh, of
Ashanti, one of our bitter foes. The Adoo, the Anno,
and the Jimini kings have long ago made blood-brotherhood
with our chiefs, therefore we are enabled to pass in
peace by this route alone."</p>

<p>Before darkness fell we disembarked at a small village
on the left bank, the name of which I learnt was
Tomboura, and after our evening meal were given a hut
in which to spend the night. Soon after dawn, however,
we heard Kouaga astir, giving rapid orders to the
carriers, and when we went out to go down to the
canoes they were nowhere to be seen. We noticed,
however, that the carriers were preparing their loads
which they had no doubt landed during the night, and
Omar, advancing towards the Grand Vizier, asked:</p>

<p>"Why do we not ascend the river further? We must
cross to the other side if we would join the Great Salt
Road."</p>

<p>"Dangers lurk there, O my Master," the negro answered,
hitching his burnouse about his shoulders.
"We must travel by a circuitous route."</p>

<p>"Did not my mother command me to speed unto
her?" Omar asked, puzzled. "Is it not necessary that
we should travel by the shortest path?"</p>

<p>"The safest is the shortest," Kouaga answered with a
frown.</p>

<p>"But by following this bank we are turning our backs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a>[<a href="./images/36.png">36</a>]</span>
upon Mo. See!" and he produced from his pocket an
instrument which I did not know he possessed, a cheap
mariner's compass.</p>

<p>"Bah!" cried Kouaga in anger, after he had looked
at it a long time. "That clock of the white men has an
evil spirit within. See! its trembling finger points always
in the direction of the Great Evil. It is bewitched. Cast
it away. Kouaga has already made fetish for this journey."</p>

<p>"But why should we travel in an entirely opposite
direction to Mo?" I argued, seeing that a crowd of
grinning impish-looking carriers had gathered around us,
enjoying our controversy.</p>

<p>"For three-score years Kouaga has lived in the forest
and on the plains," he answered, turning to me. "He
knows the direction of Mo."</p>

<p>"Oh, let him have his own way," Omar cried at last,
finding persuasion of no avail. Then turning to the
Grand Vizier he said in a firm tone: "Listen, Kouaga.
If by your obstinacy we are delayed one single day, I shall
inform my mother of that fact, and you will assuredly lose
your office and most likely your head also. Therefore act
as you think fit. Omar, Prince of Mo, has spoken."</p>

<p>"Kouaga bore the staff of the Great White Queen
unto thee. He is the trusted of the Naya, if not of her
son," the negro answered, turning away. But in that
brief instant I noticed an expression on his face of
relentless cruelty. An expression such as one might
expect to see upon the face of a murderer.</p>

<p>Truth to tell, I had never liked Kouaga; now I instinctively
hated him. But ere he had strode a dozen
paces he turned back smiling, saying:</p>

<p>"I mean no defiance to the Son of my Queen. He
is in my charge, and I will take him safely back unto Mo,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a>[<a href="./images/37.png">37</a>]</span>
the city with walls unbreakable, the capital of the kingdom
unconquerable."</p>

<p>"I shall act as I have decided," Omar answered with
true princely hauteur. "The rulers of Mo never depart
from their word."</p>

<p>"Very well," the other answered laughing, at the same
time lighting his pipe with cool indifference. Then,
glancing round to see that all was ready, he shouted an
order to the head-man and the string of carriers moved
away, jabbering and shouting, down the path into the dark
gloomy forest depths.</p>

<p>In ill-humour we followed. I must confess that towards
Kouaga I entertained an ill-defined feeling of distrust.
Once or twice during that day's march in the dull dispiriting
gloom, almost every ray of daylight being shut
out by the thick canopy of creepers spreading from tree
to tree, I had caught Omar surreptitiously consulting his
pocket compass, and saw upon his face a look of anxiety.
Yet, on the other hand, Kouaga had become particularly
jocular, and the carriers were now singing snatches of
songs, joking, and laughing good-humouredly at each
other's misfortunes, whereas on our journey from the coast
to the river they had generally preserved a sullen silence.</p>

<p>No. Try how I would I could not rid myself of the
thought that there was something very mysterious in
Kouaga's actions.</p>

<h3>THE ROYAL JUJUS.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the fifth day after we had left our canoes the Grand
Vizier of Mo had gone far forward along the line of
carriers to speak with the head-man, and Omar was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a>[<a href="./images/38.png">38</a>]</span>
walking immediately before me at the rear of the procession.</p>

<p>As I pulled him by the sleeve he halted, and when the
last carrier had got out of hearing I confided to my
friend my misgivings.</p>

<p>"Have you not noticed of late a change in Kouaga's
manner towards us?" I asked him. "At first he was
deferential and submissive to your every wish, but it
occurs to me that of late his manner is overbearing, and
he watches us closely, as if fearing we might escape."</p>

<p>"Curiously enough," my friend replied, "I have for
some days past had similar thoughts. If he's playing
any double game his life won't be worth a moment's purchase
when once we enter our own land."</p>

<p>"But you had perfect confidence in him," I observed.</p>

<p>"Yes. If my mother trusts him as her chief
adviser I have no right to entertain any suspicion of his
fidelity," he said.</p>

<p>"True, but, after all, you are the Prince and heir.
Surely he ought to have followed your desire as to the
route we should take."</p>

<p>"The route!" he cried. "Since we left the river we
have travelled in these cross-paths in such an amazing
manner that at present I have no idea where we are."</p>

<p>"The carriers have, or they would not be in such high
spirits," I observed.</p>

<p>"Yes, but the strangest part of the affair is that every
man among them fears to tell us anything. I have
secretly questioned most of them as to Kouaga's motive,
and all I can glean is that the fetish-man at Tomboura
gathered them together and, after performing some of
the usual rites and sacrificing to our Crocodile-god
Zomara, told them if a word were spoken to us regarding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a>[<a href="./images/39.png">39</a>]</span>
our route or destination the dread god will meet us in the
forest path and devour all of us. Not one shall survive."</p>

<p>"And you believe this pagan humbug?" I exclaimed,
in disgust<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: added missing period">.</ins></p>

<p>He opened his dark eyes wide, regarding me in
astonishment. I had never before ridiculed his religion.</p>

<p>"The jujus around my neck preserve me from every evil,
except those worked by Zomara. He is the great god
whose power only the fetish-man can withstand. Slaves,
princes, kings, all sacrifice to him. If we offend him
death or torture is inevitably our punishment."</p>

<p>"Do you think you've offended him?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"I know not," he sighed with a serious look. "If I
have, then nothing can save me; the fetish-man of
Tomboura has worked evil against me."</p>

<p>"Well," I said, "this is my first experience of Africa,
but it strikes me very forcibly that these fetish-men of
yours will do anything they are paid to do. What
was there to prevent Kouaga paying that hideous old
demon at Tomboura to utter his horrible incantations
and so frighten our carriers into silence?"</p>

<p>"Zomara is a terrible god. None dare tamper with
him, or utter his name in vain threats," Omar answered.</p>

<p>"Well, whoever he is I still stick to my opinion," I
said. "Depend upon it Kouaga is at the bottom of this
conspiracy of silence."</p>

<p>Just at that moment the black face of that worthy,
rendered darker by the snow-white haick that surrounded
it, appeared among the tangled bamboos. He
had missed us, and had come back to search. Yes, my surmise
seemed correct. He was watching us closely and
trying to understand our conversation.</p>

<p>That evening when we halted and the natives went<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a>[<a href="./images/40.png">40</a>]</span>
into the bush to collect fuel for the fire, I managed to
take one or two of them aside and secretly inquire our
destination. But I got the same answer always.</p>

<p>"Zomara has tied our tongues. He commands us to
be mute, or we shall be destroyed to the last one."</p>

<p>To endeavour to learn anything from these simple-minded
blacks seemed useless. They would speak freely
on every subject, indeed they seemed fond of talking with
one whose face was white, yet regarding our journey they
obeyed the command of the fetish-man to the very letter.
It is the same everywhere in West and Central Africa; the
fetish-man rules. What he says is more law than the
word of kings. If he declares a man or woman bewitched
that person will assuredly be murdered before the sun
sets; if he orders the people of the village to perform a
certain action they will do it, even if death stares them
in the face. They blindly believe that the fetish is all-powerful,
and that the half naked dancing savages who
administer it are endowed with supernatural powers.</p>

<p>That night, feeling tired out I threw myself down early
near the camp fire and slept soundly for several hours.
But at length some unusual sound awoke me, and when
I opened my eyes I saw that the fire had died down to
one single flickering ember, which still blazing cast a fitful
light upon the boles of the forest giants around.</p>

<p>Scarcely had I opened my eyes when I became
conscious of low whispering in my vicinity. This
thoroughly aroused me, and without stirring my body I
slowly turned my head, when to my astonishment I
beheld Kouaga, standing erect with arms folded beneath
his white burnouse, talking in an undertone to a dark-bearded
stranger who also wore flowing Arab garments
and bore in his hand a long-barrelled flint-lock gun with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a>[<a href="./images/41.png">41</a>]</span>
quaintly-inlaid stock. The man seemed older than the
Grand Vizier of Mo, for his beard was tinged with grey,
and the brown hand that held the gun was lean and bony.</p>

<p>I strained my ears to catch the drift of their earnest
conversation, but could not. It was tantalizing that
they spoke in so low a tone, for the stranger seemed to
mumble into his beard, while Kouaga whispered with
his mouth turned from me. The presence of a stranger
in our camp was, to say the least, strange, for through
those gloomy forest glades no single traveller could
journey. Omar had told me that for a person to attempt
to traverse that region alone would be merely suicide.
My friend was sleeping soundly at some distance from
me, therefore I could not awaken him without attracting
attention. If only he would open his eyes, I thought, he
might recognize the new comer, either as friend or foe.</p>

<p>But no, he slept on as peacefully as if he were still in
the cosy dormitory at old Trigger's, with its blue and
white counterpanes and windows commanding a wide
sweep of distant sea.</p>

<p>While I lay gazing upon my friend and hoping that he
might open his eyes, I suddenly heard the stranger raise
his voice louder than before. It was only for an instant,
but in that moment upon my ear there fell three words
the English equivalents of which I understood.</p>

<p>They were "Seek the treasure!"</p>

<p>But I could distinguish nothing more, and in a few
moments the two men hurriedly snapped fingers, and
the mysterious stranger disappeared noiselessly into the
dark silent bush.</p>

<p>When the loud blasts from the ivory-horn, with its
hideous ornamentation of human teeth, proclaimed the
advent of another day I took Omar aside and told him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a>[<a href="./images/42.png">42</a>]</span>
of what I had witnessed and overheard. After I had
described the stranger he said:</p>

<p>"I know not who he may be. It is evident, however,
we are travelling in the opposite direction to Mo, therefore
we will go no further. I will command Kouaga to
return to Tomboura, cross the river, and press forward
over the hills of Dabagakha to the Black Volta."</p>

<p>"And if he refuses?"</p>

<p>"Then we will go alone."</p>

<p>An hour later, when we had eaten our plantains and
the usual babel was proceeding which was always
precursory of a start being made, my companion strode
up to Kouaga with a look of fierce determination upon
his face, saying:</p>

<p>"Give ear to my words. I am Omar, son of the Naya,
the Great White Queen, before whose wrath all nations
tremble."</p>

<p>"Speak. I listen," answered the giant negro, with a
look of surprise upon his ugly countenance.</p>

<p>"I will go no further along this path. You, the head-man
and the carriers shall return with me to the bank of
the Comoe, otherwise my mother shall punish you for
disobeying my orders. All who dare go forward from
this moment shall be sacrificed at the yam feast and the
dogs shall eat their entrails. These are my words."</p>

<p>"Then whither would you go from Tomboura?"
asked Kouaga, apparently astonished at Omar's sudden
decision.</p>

<p>"I will only approach Mo by the Great Salt Road."</p>

<p>"It is impossible. There is fighting in the hills, for
the Karaboro and the Dagari are at war."</p>

<p>"And what matters, pray, since they are both our
allies?" Omar asked.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a>[<a href="./images/43.png">43</a>]</span>
For a moment the negro was nonplussed, but with a
broad grin showing his even row of teeth, he said:</p>

<p>"The bird goes not into the serpent's lair, neither
does the son of the Queen enter the country of her
enemies."</p>

<p>"I have already given tongue to my decision," my
friend replied. "Advance, and each of your heads
shall fall beneath the keen <i>doka</i> of Gankoma, the
executioner."</p>

<p>Kouaga, hearing these words, set his teeth fiercely,
and glancing at us with his fiery eyes, the whites of
which were bloodshot, retorted:</p>

<p>"Recede, and we will carry you forward, bound as a
slave."</p>

<p>"This is a threat!" cried Omar, drawing himself up
to his full height and stretching forth his arm. "You,
whom my mother raised from a palace-slave, thus
threaten me! Let it be thus, but I warn you that if
you ever set foot across the borders of Mo, your head
shall be set upon the palace wall as a warning to disobedient
slaves." Then, turning to me, and waving
back the crowd of carriers who had collected and stood
open-mouthed around us, he said, "Come, Scars, we
will return. I have thrice traversed the path from
Tomboura to the Great Salt Road, and can follow it
without a guide."</p>

<p>Then, calling down the curse of Zomara, the dreaded,
upon them all, he turned on his heel and walked down
the narrow path we had traversed on the previous night,
while, with a final glance of triumph at the irate negro,
I followed.</p>

<p>Scarcely had we gone fifty yards, however, before a
dozen carriers, acting upon orders from Kouaga, had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a>[<a href="./images/44.png">44</a>]</span>
rushed after us, seized us, and dragged us back to him
despite our desperate struggles.</p>

<p>"So you defy me!" the negro cried in a paroxysm
of rage, as Omar was brought up. "This is because
I was fool enough to allow your white-faced friend to
accompany you. Our country is no place for whites,
but he will make a good sacrifice to Zomara when our
journey is ended. You have both refused to accompany
us, therefore we must use force." Then, turning to the
half-naked savages who held us, he said: "Bind them,
and tie them in their hammocks. Let not their bonds
be loosened until our march be ended, for both are my
prisoners." And he laughed triumphantly at our
discomfiture.</p>

<p>"You shall pay for this insult with your life," Omar
cried angrily.</p>

<p>"Take off his European clothes, and let his string of
royal jujus be burned. Henceforth he is a slave, as also
is his white companion."</p>

<p>Next moment twenty ready hands tore from Omar
most of his well-worn clothes, and although he fought
with all the strength of which he was capable, his necklet
of jujus, the magical charms that protected the Queen's
son from every evil, was ruthlessly spat upon and destroyed
by the excited natives, together with his clothes.</p>

<p>Then, after each of us had been tied in a hammock
with our hands behind our backs, we were lifted by four
stalwart bearers and carried forward at a brisk pace
towards an unknown bourne.</p>

<p>It was evident that we were not going to Mo, and it
was equally evident too, that Kouaga, whom we had
trusted implicitly, was our bitter enemy.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h3>SAMORY'S STRONGHOLD.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Through</span> dense dark forests and over great open grass-lands,
passing several villages, we were carried forward
many days, still bound and never allowed to have our
hands free except during our meals.</p>

<p>The face of Kouaga grew more brutal and fierce as
we proceeded, and he urged on the carriers until we
found ourselves travelling at a pace that for African
natives was amazing.</p>

<p>Omar spoke little. He was always pre-occupied and
thoughtful. He had told me that he now regretted
having brought me with him from England, but I
assured him that our misfortunes were not of our own
seeking, and urged him to be of good cheer.</p>

<p>Truth to tell, my heart was full of dark forebodings. I
saw in the ugly countenance of Kouaga expressions of
deadly hatred, and I knew that they were of ill-portent.
Yet to escape in that deadly bush, extending for
hundreds and hundreds of miles, dark, monotonous and
impenetrable, meant certain death even if we eluded the
watchful vigilance of this muscular negro.</p>

<p>One day, when passing through a forest village, a half-naked
savage rushed towards us brandishing his spear
and uttering a loud yell, but whether expressive of
hatred or joy I knew not. Suddenly, as he approached
the hammock in which Omar was lying, my friend addressed
him in some tongue that was strange to me, but
to which the native answered readily.</p>

<p>"As I thought, Scars!" Omar shouted to me in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a>[<a href="./images/46.png">46</a>]</span>
English a moment later. "We have travelled away from
Mo, crossed Tieba's territory, and have now entered the
country of the great Mohammedan chief Samory, my
nation's bitterest enemy. It was he who seized my
father by a ruse and sent his head back to my mother as
a hideous souvenir."</p>

<p>"But what object has Kouaga in bringing us here?"
I asked.</p>

<p>"I cannot imagine," he answered. "Unless he
travelled to England, for the sole purpose of delivering
me into the hands of our enemies. Three times within
the last five years has Samory attempted to invade our
country, but each time has been repulsed with a loss that
has partially paralysed his power. All along the right
bank of the Upper Niger his bands of hirelings and
mercenaries, whom we call Sofas, are constantly raiding
for slaves. Indeed Samory's troops are the fiercest
and most merciless in this country. They are the riff-raff
of the West Soudan and are a terror to friend and
foe, a bar to the peaceful settlement of all lands within
the range of their devastating expeditions."</p>

<p>"Do they make raids towards your country?" I
inquired, for I had heard long ago of this notorious
slave-dealing chief.</p>

<p>"Yes, constantly. They are pitiless marauders who
lay waste whole kingdoms and transform populous
districts into gloomy solitudes. While on my way from
Mo to England we passed through Sati, a large market
town at the convergence of several caravan routes, which
was only three months before a prosperous and wealthy
place situated fifty miles south of our border. We found
everything had been raided by the Sofas, who had sacked,
burned or destroyed what they were unable to take<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a>[<a href="./images/47.png">47</a>]</span>
away. Heaps of cinders marked the sites of former
homesteads, the ground was strewn with potsherds, rice
and other grain trodden under foot, while our horses
moved forward knee deep in ashes. The whole land,
lately very rich, prosperous and thickly peopled, was a
melancholy picture of utter desolation."</p>

<p>"Do you think we have actually fallen into Samory's
hands?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I fear so."</p>

<p>"But is not Kouaga Grand Vizier of Mo? Surely he
would not dare to take us through the enemy's land," I
said.</p>

<p>"Do you not remember that when he met us at Eastbourne
he forbade us to inform Makhana of our intended
departure?" he answered. "He had some object in
securing our silence and getting us away from England
secretly. It now appears more than probable that my
mother has dismissed and banished him, and he has gone
over to our enemy, Samory, who desires to seize our
country."</p>

<p>"In that case our position is indeed serious," I
observed. "We must do something to escape."</p>

<p>"No," he said. "We cannot escape. Let's put on a
bold front, and if we find ourselves prisoners of the
slave-raiding chief, I, at least, will show him that I am
heir to the Emerald Throne of Mo."</p>

<p>As each day dawned we still held upon our way, until
at length, under a broiling noon-day sun, we crossed a wide
stretch of fertile grass-land where cattle were grazing,
and there rose high before us the white fortified walls of a
large town of flat-roofed Moorish-looking houses. It was,
we afterwards learnt, called Koussan, one of Samory's
principal strongholds.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a>[<a href="./images/48.png">48</a>]</span>
As we approached the open gate, flanked on either
side by watch-towers and guarded by soldiers wearing
Arab fezes and loose white garments, a great rabble
came forth to meet us. We heard the din of tom-toms
beaten within the city, joyous shouts, and loud ear-piercing
blasts upon those great horns formed out of
elephant tusks.</p>

<p>Thus, in triumph, amid the howls and execrations of
the mob, Omar, son of Sanom, and myself, were marched
onward through the gate and up a steep narrow winding
street, where the solidly-built houses were set close
together to obtain the shade, to the market-place. Here,
amid the promiscuous firing of long flint-lock guns and
quaint ancient pistols, such as one sees in curiosity shops
at home, a further demonstration was held, our carriers
themselves infected by the popular enthusiasm, seeming
also to lose their senses. They heaped upon Omar
every indignity, scoffed and spat at him, while my own
pale face arousing the ire of the fanatical Mohammedan
populace, they denounced me as an infidel accursed of
Allah, and urged my captors to kill me and give my flesh
to the dogs.</p>

<p>Truly we were in pitiable plight.</p>

<p>I looked at Omar, but heedless of all their threats
and jeers, he walked with princely gait. His hands
were tied behind his back, his head erect, and his eyes
flashed with scorn upon those who sought his death.
Presently, turning sharply to the left, we found ourselves
in another square which we crossed, entering a great
gateway guarded by soldiers, and as soon as we were
inside the heavy iron-studded doors closed with an
ominous clang. I glanced round at the thick impregnable
walls and knew that we were in the Kasbah, or citadel.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a>[<a href="./images/49.png">49</a>]</span>
Gaily-dressed soldiers were leaning or squatting everywhere
as we crossed the several court-yards, one after
the other, until, by the direction of one of the officials
who had joined us on entering, we were led through a
low arched door, and thence a dozen soldiers who had
come forward hurried us down a flight of dark damp
steps into a foul noisome chamber below.</p>

<p>Struggles and protestations were useless. We were
pushed forward into a deep narrow cell lit only by a tiny
crack in the paving of the court above and the door
quickly bolted upon us.</p>

<p>"Well, this is certainly a dire misfortune," I said,
when we had both walked round inspecting the black
dank walls of our prison. "I wonder what fate is in
store for us?"</p>

<p>"Though they destroyed my jujus, they cannot invoke
the curses of Zomara upon me," he said. "The Crocodile-god
will not hear any enemies of the Naya."</p>

<p>"But have you no idea whatever of the motive
Kouaga has had in bringing you hither?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Not the slightest," he answered, seating himself at
last on the stone bench to rest. "It is evident, however,
that he is a traitor in the pay of Samory. On each
occasion when the Moslem chief endeavoured to conquer
our country, it was Kouaga who assumed the generalship
of our troops; it was Kouaga who fought valiantly
for his queen with his own keen sword; it was Kouaga
who drove back the enemy and urged our hosts to
slaughter them without mercy; and it was Kouaga who,
with fiendish hatred, put the prisoners to the torture.
In him my mother had a most trusted servant."</p>

<p>"He doesn't seem very trustworthy now," I observed.
"It seems to me we are caught like rats in a trap."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a>[<a href="./images/50.png">50</a>]</span>
"True," he said. "We are beset by dangers, but may
the blessings of their Allah turn to curses upon their
heads. It may be that our ignominious situation will
not satisfy the malice that Samory has conceived against
me, but if a single hair of the head of either of us is
injured, Zomara, the Crocodile-god, will punish those
who seek our discomfiture."</p>

<p>It occurred to me that it was all very well to speak in
this strain, but as no man is a prince except in his own
country, it seemed idle to expect mercy or pity. Omar
was in prison for some unknown offence, and I was held
captive with a well-remembered threat from Kouaga that
my life should be sacrificed.</p>

<p>For six hours we remained without food, but when
the light above had quite faded, three soldiers with
clanging swords unbarred the door and pushed through
some water in an earthen vessel and some <i>fufu</i>, a kind
of dumpling made of mashed African potato. During
the night, disturbed by vermin of all sorts, including
some horrible little snakes, we slept little, and at dawn
we were again visited by our captors. The next day
and the next passed uneventfully. For exercise we
paced our cell times without number, and when tired
would seat ourselves on the rough stone bench and
calmly discuss the situation.</p>

<p>The Naya, the mysterious Great White Queen, had
ordered Omar to return with all haste, yet already two
moons had run their course since we had landed in
Africa. This troubled my companion even more than
the fact of being betrayed into the hands of his enemies.</p>

<p>The tiny streak of light that showed high above our
heads grew brighter towards noon, then began slowly
to decline. Before the shadows had lengthened in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a>[<a href="./images/51.png">51</a>]</span>
court above, however, the sound of our door being
unbarred aroused us from our lethargy, and a moment
later, three soldiers entered and told us to prepare to go
before the great ruler Samory. Omar, attired only in a
small garment of bark-cloth, took no heed of his toilet,
therefore we at once announced our readiness to leave
the loathsome place with its myriad creeping things,
and it was with a feeling of intense relief that a few
minutes later we ascended to the blessed light of day.</p>

<p>Marched between a small posse of soldiers, we crossed
the court to a larger and more handsome square,
decorated in Arab style with horseshoe arches and wide
colonnades, until at the further end a great curtain of
crimson velvet was drawn aside and we found ourselves
in a spacious hall, wherein many gorgeously attired
persons had assembled and in the centre of which was
erected a great canopy of amaranth-coloured silk supported
by pillars of gold surmounted by the crescent.
Beneath, reclining on a divan, slowly fanned by a dozen
gaudily-attired negroes, was a dark-faced, full-bearded
man of middle age, whose black eyes regarded us
keenly as we entered. He was dressed in a robe of
bright yellow silk, and in his turban there glittered a
single diamond that sparkled and gleamed with a
thousand iridescent rays. His fat brown hand was
loaded with rings, and jewels glittered everywhere
upon his belt, his sword, and his slippers of bright green.</p>

<p>It was the notorious and dreaded chieftain, Samory.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h3>THE SECRET OF THE QUEEN.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">As</span> we were led forward to the space in front of the
divan all eyes were directed towards us. The glitter and
pomp of the merciless slave-raider's court was dazzling.
Before their ruler all men salaamed. His officers surrounding
him, watched every movement of his face, and
the four-score slaves behind him stood mute and motionless,
ready to do his bidding at any instant.</p>

<p>When our feet touched the great carpet spread before
him, and we halted, he raised himself to a sitting posture,
fixing his dark, gleaming eyes upon us. At sight of
Omar a sudden frown of displeasure crossed his features,
but an instant later a grim smile of triumph lit his
sinister face.</p>

<p>Apparently he was waiting for us to bow before him,
but Omar had forbidden me to do so.</p>

<p>"And who, pray, art thou, that thou deignest not
to bend the knee before me?" he cried, in anger
that his people should witness a slur thus cast upon his
power.</p>

<p>"I am Omar, son of the Naya of Mo," my companion
answered, folding his arms resolutely, and regarding
the potentate with supreme disdain. "Princes
do not make obeisance to any but their equals."</p>

<p>"Am I not thine equal, then, thou son of offal?"
cried Samory.</p>

<p>"In strength thou art, possibly, but not by birth. In
order to protect thy country against the white men thou<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a>[<a href="./images/53.png">53</a>]</span>
hast sought to make palaver with Prempeh of Ashanti,
but I would remind thee that the rulers of Mo have
never besought any aid of their neighbours."</p>

<p>"Thou speakest well, lad," he said thoughtfully.
"Thine is a mighty kingdom, but by peace or war I
will rule over it."</p>

<p>"Never, while I live," answered Omar with pride.</p>

<p>"But thou art the last of thy race. If thou diest&mdash;what
then?"</p>

<p>"If I die, then every man in Mo will seek blood
revenge upon thee, and Zomara will guide them into
this, thy land, and arm them with spears of fire."</p>

<p>"I care nought for thy Naya nor thy pagan Crocodile-god,"
exclaimed the Mohammedan chief impatiently.
"Bow unto my divan, or of a verity my slaves shall
compel thee."</p>

<p>"I refuse."</p>

<p>"May thine entrails be burned," cried Samory in
anger, and raising his hand he ordered the guards of the
divan to cast us both to earth before him.</p>

<p>They threw us down, and their ruler, rising, placed
his foot firmly on the neck of the heir to the throne of
Mo, saying in a loud voice:</p>

<p>"As I hold thee thus within my power, so also will I,
ere many moons have run, hold thy country. Cursed
by the Prophet may be thy detested race. There is
neither peace nor friendship, there is neither gratitude
nor love in the people of Samory, and they shall be the
first to curse thee. When I enter Mo every day shall
the knife of the executioner be fed with blood; thy
cities shall mourn the loss of their sages, husbands their
wives, wives their children, and children their fathers.
The country shall be devastated to its most northerly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a>[<a href="./images/54.png">54</a>]</span>
limits and it shall be rendered a wilderness of silence
and sorrow."</p>

<p>Then withdrawing his foot, amid the plaudits of his
crowd of fierce-looking courtiers, Omar sprang to his
feet in rage, and facing him, cried:</p>

<p>"The men of Mo are forewarned already against thy
designs, notwithstanding that our ex-Grand Vizier
Kouaga, the son of a dungheap who betrayed us hither,
hath joined thine accursed ranks. The soldiers of the
Naya are still anxious for the fourth time to try conclusions
with thy white-cloaked rabble. Come, march
forward into Mo&mdash;thou wilt never return."</p>

<p>"Thou defiest me, even as thy mother hath done," he
roared, his hand upon the bejewelled hilt of his curved
blade. "Were it not for one fact I would smite thee
dead."</p>

<p>"I fear thee not," Omar answered with a calmness
that astounded me. "Sooner or later thou wilt, I suppose,
order my death, therefore the sooner the better."</p>

<p>"Why insultest thou our race by bringing hither with
thee this dog of a Christian?" the chief enquired, looking
at me with a terrible expression of hatred.</p>

<p>"He cometh as my companion," replied Omar briefly<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: added missing period">.</ins></p>

<p>"As thy companion he shall accompany thee to the
grave," Samory cried fiercely, his eyes swimming in
malice.</p>

<p>"So be it," answered Omar, with a smile of contempt.
"May Zomara curse thy work."</p>

<p>"Speak, infidel!" Samory said, fixing his fiery glance
upon me. "Whence comest thou?"</p>

<p>"From England," I answered briefly, in fear.</p>

<p>"From that country where dwell the accursed of
Allah," he said, as if to himself. "They are pig-eaters<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a>[<a href="./images/55.png">55</a>]</span>
who despise the Book of Everlasting Will and declare
our great Prophet&mdash;on whom may be everlasting peace&mdash;to
be a false one. Accursed be thy country, infidel!
May thy people suffer every torment of Al-H&acirc;wiyat;
may their food be offal, and may they slake their thirst
with boiling pitch. The white men have sent their
messengers to me time after time to urge me to ally myself
with them, but it shall never be recorded that Samory
besought the assistance of infidels to extend his
kingdom. We fight beneath the green banner of Al-Isl&acirc;m,
and will continue to do so until we die. Ere
long, the day of the Jehad will dawn; then the forces
of Al-Isl&acirc;m will unite to sweep from the face of the
earth those white parasites who seek the overthrow of
the Faithful. Allah is merciful, and his servant is
patient," added the old scoundrel piously.</p>

<p>There arose, as if with one voice from those assembled,
the words: "Samory hath spoken! Allah
send him blessings abundant!" and as they did so each
fingered his amulets, little scraps of parchment whereon
verses from the Kor&acirc;n were written in sprawly Arabic.
At that moment, too, I noticed, for the first time, that
right opposite us was the grinning, evil face of the black
giant, Kouaga, the man who had so foully betrayed us.</p>

<p>We exchanged glances, and he laughed at us in
triumph.</p>

<p>"Dost thou intend to keep me as hostage?" Omar
asked his mother's enemy boldly.</p>

<p>"Until thou hast performed the service for which I
caused thee to journey hither with our good Kouaga."</p>

<p>"The traitor's head shall fall," Omar blurted out with
pardonable passion. Then he asked, "Thou desirest a
service of me. Well, what is it?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a>[<a href="./images/56.png">56</a>]</span>
There was a silence so deep that a feather if dropped
upon the cool floor of polished marble would have made
audible sound, and Samory slowly seated himself.</p>

<p>"Give ear unto my words," he said a few moments later,
in a clear voice, as he stroked his beard with his fat hand.
"I know that within thine impenetrable kingdom many
undreamed-of mysteries and wealth untold lie concealed.
This is common report. Thine ancestors in
their treasure-house, the whereabouts of which is known
only to the Naya and to thyself, have deposited heaps of
jewels and great quantities of gold, the spoils of war
through many generations. I desire to ascertain, and I
will ascertain from thine own lips, the exact spot where
we may seek that treasure."</p>

<p>A look of abject bewilderment crossed Omar's features,
and he turned to me, saying in English:</p>

<p>"All is now plain, Scars. Because only the Naya herself
is aware of the spot where the treasure of the
Sanoms is deposited, my mother, on the eve of my
departure for England, divulged to me the secret, fearing
lest she should die before my return. Kouaga was
the only person who knew that my mother had thus
spoken to me, and he has informed Samory and joined
him for the purpose of obtaining the treasure."</p>

<p>"Is not Kouaga aware of the spot where the treasure
is hidden?" I asked hurriedly.</p>

<p>"No. He came to England at Samory's suggestion
to convey me hither so that they could get the secret
from me. On gaining the information it is apparently
their intention to make a raid, with Kouaga leading, in
order to secure our wealth."</p>

<p>But Samory himself interrupted our consultation.</p>

<p>"Speak not with thine infidel companion," he roared<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: added missing period">.</ins><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a>[<a href="./images/57.png">57</a>]</span>
"Answer me. Tell me where this treasure of the
Sanoms lieth."</p>

<p>"The son of the Naya is no traitor," he answered with
hauteur.</p>

<p>"If thou speakest thou shalt have thy liberty.
Indeed, if thou deemest fit thou shalt join the expedition
into Mo, and share with us the loot," the chief
urged.</p>

<p>"Thy words insult me," cried Omar, full of wrath.
"I will never share with thee, who murdered my father,
that which is my birthright."</p>

<p>"Very well," answered Samory indifferently. "Thou
needest not. We will take it, kill thy mother and annex
thy country. Already the whole kingdom is ripe for
revolt, and we shall quickly accomplish the rest. I had
thee brought hither because thou alone holdest a secret
I desire to know&mdash;the secret of the royal Treasure-house,
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And I refuse to disclose it," my companion said, interrupting
the gaudily-attired potentate.</p>

<p>"If thou wilt not speak willingly, then my executioners
shall force thee to loosen thine obstinate tongue's strings,"
Samory cried, frowning, while the hideous face of the
black traitor grinned horribly.</p>

<p>"The secret of the queen is inviolable. My lips are
sealed," answered Omar with resolution.</p>

<p>"Then my executioners shall unseal them."</p>

<p>"If I cannot save my country from desolation at the
hands of thy lawless bands," exclaimed my friend, "I
can at least preserve from thee the treasure accumulated
by my ancestors to be used only for the emancipation of
our country should evil befall it. Until the present, Mo
hath been held against all invaders by the hosts ready at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a>[<a href="./images/58.png">58</a>]</span>
the hands of my mother and her predecessors, and even
now if thou marchest over my dead body thy path will
not be clear of those who will oppose thee. Remember,"
he added, "the army of the Naya possesses many pom-poms<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
of the English, each of which is equal in power
to the fire of one of thy battalions. With them our
people will sweep away thine hosts like grains of sand
before the sirocco."</p>

<p>"Darest thou oppose my will?" cried Samory, rising
in a sudden ebullition of wrath.</p>

<p>"Thy will ruleth me not," Omar answered, his face
pale and calm. "A Sanom never betrayed his trust,
even though he suffered death."</p>

<p>"Very well, offspring of sebel," he hissed between his
white teeth. "We will test thy resolution, and cause
thee to eat thy brave words. Thy body shall be racked
by the torture, and thy flesh given unto the ants to
eat." Then, turning to the executioner, a big negro with
face hideously scarred by many cuts, who stood at his
side leaning upon his razor-edged <i>doka</i>, he added:</p>

<p>"You know my will. Loosen the lad's tongue. Let
it be done here, so that we may watch the effect of thy
persuasion."</p>

<p>And all laughed loudly at their ruler's grim humour,
while twenty slaves of the executioner rushed away in
obedience to their master's command to bring in the instruments
of torture.</p>

<p>I turned to Omar. He still stood erect, with arms
folded. But his face was pale as death.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<h3>CONDEMNED TO THE TORTURE.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Eager</span> to witness the agony of the son of the powerful
Naya of Mo, the crowd of evil-faced men in silken robes
who surrounded their brutal chief watched with lively
anticipation the preparations that were in a few moments
in active progress. The black slaves of the weirdly-dressed
executioner first carried in a large blazing brazier,
and rolling away the thick crimson carpet placed it upon
the floor of polished marble in front of Samory's divan.</p>

<p>A slave boy had, in response to a sign from the great
chief, lit his long pipe with its bejewelled mouthpiece,
and as he half reclined on the couch he smoked on
calmly, regarding the execution of his orders with undisguised
satisfaction.</p>

<p>The slaves, each wearing black loin-cloths with
bunches of sable ostrich feathers on their heads that
waved like funeral-plumes as they walked, brought in
grim-looking instruments of iron like blacksmiths' tools,
strange spiked chains, fetters with sharp spikes on the
inside, and many curiously-contrived irons, each devised
to cause some horrible torture, each red with rust, the
rust of blood.</p>

<p>As my eyes fell upon them I involuntarily shuddered.
Omar, my loyal friend, was about to be murdered
by these inhuman brutes, and I knew that I was
powerless to defend him from their fiendish wrath.
Already he was standing in the grip of two black-plumed
slaves, while no attempt had been made to secure me.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a>[<a href="./images/60.png">60</a>]</span>
I stood near him, breathlessly anxious, wondering what
the end would be.</p>

<p>Presently, when all was ready, a silence fell. Then, the
deep voice of Samory was heard, asking the final question:</p>

<p>"Speak, son of a dog," he cried, addressing my
unhappy friend. "Wilt thou tell us where the secret
Treasure-house of the Sanoms is situated?"</p>

<p>"No," Omar answered, flashing at his enemy a look
of defiance. "I will not betray my mother's secret to
my father's murderer."</p>

<p>"Then use thy powers of persuasion," he said, lifting
his hand towards the executioner. "Unseal his lips,
and that quickly."</p>

<p>"Chief of our race, whose praises rise earliest and most
frequent in the presence of Allah, I am ready to obey
thee," answered the hideous functionary. So saying, he
took up a long iron instrument, fashioned like a pair
of pincers and thrust it into the burning coals.</p>

<p>"Vain, O persecutor," cried Omar in a loud voice.
"Vain are thy tortures against the will power of the son
of the Great White Queen, whose veins are filled with
royal blood. Tremble at thy doom, a myriad of my
race are determined against thee, and thy throne
noddeth over thine head. The fiend of darkness is let
loose, and the powers of evil shall prevail."</p>

<p>"Hold thy peace," shouted the Moslem chieftain,
enraged. "Thine own blood shall make satisfaction for
those of my race slain by thy warriors when last we
marched upon thy kingdom."</p>

<p>"The curses of Takhar, of Tuirakh, and of Zomara,
dreaded by all men, be upon thee," my companion cried,
lifting his voice until it sounded loud and clear through
the vaulted hall, and pointing to the slave-raiding king<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a>[<a href="./images/61.png">61</a>]</span>
whose power no European influence could break. "May
the vengeance of my injured blood fasten upon thy life."</p>

<p>Those around Samory looked aghast as Omar uttered
these ominous predictions in the spirit of prophecy, for
they perceived he spoke as he was moved, and the whole
council seemed dismayed. Silence and amazement for
a few moments prevailed. Omar alone appeared unconcerned
at his fate.</p>

<p>Quickly, however, the executioner bent over his fire,
and as the wretched victim of the potentate's hatred
was dragged to a kind of square iron frame that lay
upon the floor, thrown down, and fastened thereto by
his wrists and ankles, the fiendish-looking hireling took
the long pincers, now red hot, and tore from Omar's
shoulder a great piece of flesh.</p>

<p>A piercing scream of agony rent the air, mingled with
the triumphant jeers of the excited councillors, but my
friend's teeth were tightly clenched and his face
blanched to the lips. Again and again cries of agony
escaped him as the red-hot iron touched him, although
he exerted every nerve to maintain a dogged silence.
From his back, shoulders, and chest the brutal negro
ruthlessly tore pieces, holding them up to the assembled
court in triumph, while the air was filled with the
nauseating odour of burning flesh.</p>

<p>The sight was so sickening that I turned faint, and
with difficulty prevented myself from falling.</p>

<p>"Wilt thou now impart to us the knowledge that we
seek?" asked Samory in ringing tones that sounded
above the whispered exultations of his courtiers.</p>

<p>"Never," gasped Omar in a weak voice, his eyes
starting from his head. "Life cannot be unchequered
by the frowns of fate, but death must bring dumbness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a>[<a href="./images/62.png">62</a>]</span>
to my lips. Caution, when besmeared in blood, is no
longer virtue, or wisdom, but wretched and degenerate
cowardice; no, never let him that was born to execute
judgment secure his honours by cruelty and oppression.
Hath not thy Kor&acirc;n told thee that fear and submission is
a subject's tribute, yet mercy is the attribute of Allah, and
the most pleasing endowment of the vicegerents of earth."</p>

<p>"From the lips of a fool there sometimes falleth
wisdom," Samory said impatiently. "Thou hast deemed
it wise to thwart the will of one whose wish is law, therefore
ere the bud of thy youth unfolds in the fulness of
manhood, thou shalt be cut off as the husbandman
destroyeth the deadly serpent in the field."</p>

<p>"Is there no way to build up the seat of justice and
mercy but in murder?" cried Omar. At a signal from
the slave-raider, however, the scarred-face brute again
withdrew the pincers from the fiery brazier, and applied
them once more to the wretched prince's back.</p>

<p>He winced and turned with such strength that his
limbs, fettered as they were in bonds of blood-smeared
iron, cracked, while the muscles and veins stood out
knotted like cords. The spotless marble of the floor
was stained by a dark red pool, becoming larger every
moment as the life-blood dripped slowly from beneath.</p>

<p>The scene was revolting. I placed my hands over my
eyes to shut out from my gaze the horrible contortions
of the victim's face.</p>

<p>Yet those assembled were gleeful and excited. Omar
was the son of their unconquerable enemy, and they
delighted in witnessing his humiliation and agony.
Times without number the negro with the strangely-marked
visage seared the flesh of my helpless companion;
then in response to his orders his black-plumed slaves<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a>[<a href="./images/63.png">63</a>]</span>
drew tighter the bonds that confined his ankles and
wrists until the sound of the crushing of bones and
sinews reached our ears.</p>

<p>Again a loud shriek echoed along the high-roofed hall.
Omar was no longer able to bear the excruciating pain
in silence.</p>

<p>"Courage," I cried in English, heedless of the consequences.
"Courage. Let this fiend see that he
cannot rule us as he does his cringing slaves."</p>

<p>"Think! think of yourself, Scars!" he gasped with
extreme difficulty. "If they kill me, forgive me for
bringing you from England. I&mdash;I did not know that
this trap had been prepared for me."</p>

<p>"I forgive you everything," I answered, glancing for a
moment at his white, blood-smeared countenance.
"Bear up. You must&mdash;you shall not die."</p>

<p>But even as I spoke, the executioner, who had been
bending over the fire, withdrew with his tongs a band of
iron with long sharp spikes on the inside now red with
heat, and as the slaves released the pressure upon his
wrists and ankles the sinister-faced negro placed the
terrible band around the victim's waist and by means of
a screw quickly drew it so tight that the red-hot spikes
ran into the flesh, causing it to smoke and emit a hissing
noise that was horrible.</p>

<p>Again poor Omar squirmed in pain and gave vent to
a shrill, agonised cry. But it was not repeated.</p>

<p>Everyone stood eager and open-mouthed, and even
the villainous Samory rose from his divan to more closely
watch the effect of the fearful torture now being applied.</p>

<p>The victim's upturned face was white as the marble
pavement. From the corners of the mouth a thin red
stream oozed, and the closed eyes and imperceptible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a>[<a href="./images/64.png">64</a>]</span>
breathing showed plainly that no torture, however inhuman,
could cause him further agony. He had lapsed
into unconsciousness.</p>

<p>"Hold!" cried Samory at last, seeing the executioner
about to prepare yet another torture. "Take the pagan
author of malice from my sight, let his wounds be dressed,
and apply thy persuasion unto him again to-morrow at
sundown. He shall speak, I vow before the great Allah
and Mahomet, the Prophet of the Just. He shall tell us
where the treasure lieth hidden."</p>

<p>"O, light of the earth," cried one of the councillors, a
white-bearded sage who wore a robe of crimson silk
beautifully embroidered. "Though the hand of time
hath not yet spread the fruits of manhood upon this
youth's cheeks, yet neither the splendour of thy court nor
the words from thy lips could steal from the young
prince the knowledge of himself. He hath cursed thee
with the three curses of the pagans Takhar, Tuirakh, and
Zomara, the Crocodile-god, held in awe by all."</p>

<p>"Well, thinkest thou that I fear the empty threats of
a youth whose hostility towards me arises from the fact
that I captured his father on the Great Salt Road, and
smiting off his head, sent it as a present to the Naya?"
asked Samory in indignation.</p>

<p>But as the black-plumed slaves removed the inanimate
form of Omar, the aged councillor stepped forward
boldly, saying:</p>

<p>"I perceive, O source of light, that the dark clouds
of evil are gathering to disturb the hours of futurity;
the spirits of the wicked are preparing the storm and
the tempest against thee; but&mdash;the volumes of Fate are
torn from my sight, and the end of thy troubles is unknown."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a>[<a href="./images/65.png">65</a>]</span>
The councillors exchanged glances and stood aghast,
but Samory, livid with rage, sprang from his divan and
commenced to upbraid the aged seer for his words of
warning. I was not, however, allowed to listen to the
further discussion of the old man's prophecy, being
hurried by two of the torturer's slaves back to my underground
cell, where I remained alone for many hours
awaiting Omar, who, I presumed, was being brought
back to consciousness in another part of the great impregnable
fortress, the mazes of which were bewildering.</p>



<hr class="full" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<h3>ZOMARA.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> darkness and anxiety I remained alone for many days
in the foul subterranean prison. Had the fiendish
tortures been repeated upon my hapless friend, I
wondered; or had he succumbed to the injuries already
inflicted? Hour by hour I waited, listening to the
shuffling footsteps of my gaolers, but only once a day
there came a black slave to hand me my meagre ration
of food and depart without deigning to give answer to
any of my questions.</p>

<p>I became sick with anxiety, and at last felt that I must
abandon all hope of again seeing him. I was alone in
the midst of the fiercest and most fanatical people of the
whole of Africa, a people whose supreme delight it was
to torture the whites that fell into their hands as vengeance
for the many expeditions sent against them.
Through those dismal days when silence and the want
of air oppressed me, I remembered the old adage that
when Hope goes out Death smiles and stalks in, but
fortunately, although wearied and dejected, I did not quite<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a>[<a href="./images/66.png">66</a>]</span>
abandon all thought of ever again meeting my companion.
The hope of seeing him, of being able to escape and get
into the land of Mo, was now the sole anchor of my life, yet
as the monotonous hours passed, the light in the chink
above grew brighter and time after time gradually faded
into pitch darkness, I felt compelled to admit that my
anticipations were without foundation, and that Omar,
the courageous descendant of a truly kingly race, was dead.</p>

<p>In the dull dispiriting gloom I sat hour after hour on
the stone bench encrusted with the dirt of years, calmly
reflecting upon the bright, happy life I had been, alas!
too eager to renounce, and told myself with sorrow that,
after all, old Trigger's school, or even the existence of
a London clerk, was preferable to imprisonment in
Samory's stronghold. Many were the means by which
I sought to make time pass more rapidly, but the
hours had leaden feet, and while the tiny ray struggled
through above, my mind was constantly racked by bitter
thoughts of the past, and a despairing dread of the
hopeless future.</p>

<p>One morning, however, when I had lost all count of
the days of my solitary confinement, my heart was
suddenly caused to leap by hearing the unusual sound of
footsteps, and a few moments later my door was thrown
open and I was ordered by my captors to come forth.</p>

<p>I rose, and following them unwillingly, wondering what
fate had been decided for me, ascended the steep
flight of steps to the courtyard above, wherein I found a
crowd of Arab nomads in their white haicks and
burnouses. Samory was also there, and before him, still
defiant and apparently almost recovered from his wounds,
stood my friend Omar<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: added missing period">.</ins></p>

<p>I sprang towards him with a loud cry of joy, and our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a>[<a href="./images/67.png">67</a>]</span>
recognition was mutually enthusiastic, as neither of us
had known what fate had overtaken the other; but ere
he could relate how he had fared, the Mohammedan chief
lifted his hand, and a dead silence fell on those assembled.</p>

<p>"Omar, son of the accursed Naya whom may Eblis
smite with the fiery sword, give ear unto my words," he
said, in a loud, harsh voice. "Thou hast defied me,
and will not impart to me the secret of the Treasure-house,
even though I offer thee thy freedom. I have
spared thee the second torture in order that a fate more
degrading and more terrible shall be thine. Hearken!
Thou and thy friend are sold to these Arab slavers for
this single copper coin."</p>

<p>For an instant he showed us the coin in the palm of
his brown hand, then tossed it far away from him with a
gesture of disgust.</p>

<p>"Ye are both sold," he continued, "sold for the
smallest coin, to be taken to Kumassi as slaves for their
pagan sacrifice."</p>

<p>At his words we both started. It was indeed a terrible
doom to which this villainous brute had consigned us.
We were to be butchered with awful rites for the
edification of Prempeh and his wild hordes of fanatics!</p>

<p>"Rather kill us outright," Omar said boldly, his
hands trembling nevertheless.</p>

<p>"Death will seize thee quite soon enough," laughed
the chief derisively. "Mine ally Prempeh will have
the satisfaction of offering a queen's son to the fetish."</p>

<p>"Rest assured that the god Zomara will reward thee
for this day's evil work," Omar cried, with a fierce look
in his eyes. "Thou hast spent fiercest hatred upon me,
but even if I die, word will sooner or later be carried into
Mo that thou wert the cause of the death of the last of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a>[<a href="./images/68.png">68</a>]</span>
my race. Then every man capable of bearing arms
will rise against thee. Standing here, I make prophecy
that this thy kingdom shall be uprooted as a weed in
the garden of peace, and that thine own blood shall
make satisfaction for thy cruelty."</p>

<p>"Begone!" cried Samory, in a tumult of wrath.
And turning to the Arabs he cried in a commanding
tone: "Take the dog to the slaughterers. Let me never
look again upon his face."</p>

<p>But ere they could seize him, he had lifted his hand,
invoking the curse of Zomara, saying:</p>

<p>"Omar, Prince of Mo, has spoken. This kingdom
of Samory shall, ere many moons, be shaken to its
foundations."</p>

<p>But the fierce Arabs quickly dragged us forth, bound
us when out of sight of the great chief, and led us
beyond the gates of the Kasbah to where we found a
great slave caravan assembled in readiness to depart.
Fully one hundred black slaves, each fastened in a long
chain, were lying huddled up in the shadow, seeking a
brief rest after a long and tedious march. Most of
them were terrible objects, mere skin and bone, and all
showed signs of brutal ill-treatment, their backs bearing
great festering sores caused by the lashes of their pitiless
captors. The majority of them had, I ascertained, been
captured in the forest wilds beyond the Niger, and all
preserved a stolid indifference, for they knew their
terrible doom. They were being hurried on to Kumassi
to be sold to King Prempeh for sacrificial purposes.</p>

<p>To this wretched perspiring crowd of hopeless
humanity we were bound, and amid the jeers of a
number of Samory's officials who had crowded to the
gate to see us depart, we moved onward, our steps<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a>[<a href="./images/69.png">69</a>]</span>
hastened by the heavy whips of our masters who,
mounted on wiry little ponies and heavily armed, galloped
up and down the line administering blows to the laggards
or the sick.</p>

<p>From the city away across the open grass-lands we
wended our way, a dismal, sorrowful procession, but
Omar, now beside me again, briefly related how, after
being removed from the torture-frame, his wounds had
been dressed and he had been tenderly nursed by an old
female slave who had taken compassion upon him. A
dozen times messengers from Samory had come to offer
him his liberty in exchange for the secret of the
Treasure-house, but he had steadfastly refused. Twice
the scoundrel Kouaga had visited him and made merry
over his discomfiture.</p>

<p>"But," said my friend, "the boastings of the traitor
are empty words. When we laugh it shall be at his vain
implorings for a speedy death."</p>

<p>"To him we owe all these misfortunes," I said.</p>

<p>"Yes, everything. But if only we get into Mo he
shall render an account of his misdeeds to my mother.
No mercy will be shown him, for before the Naya's
wrath the nation trembles."</p>

<p>"But our position at the present moment is one of
extreme gravity," I observed. "We are actually on our
way to another of your mother's enemies, whose relentless
cruelty is common talk throughout the world."</p>

<p>"True," he answered. "If we find the slightest loop-hole
for escape we must embrace it. But if not&mdash;&mdash;"
and he paused. "If not, then we must meet our deaths
with the calm indifference alike traditional of the Sanoms
and of Englishmen."</p>

<p>Whenever misfortune seemed to threaten he appeared<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a>[<a href="./images/70.png">70</a>]</span>
only the more composed. Each day showed me that,
even though an African and a semi-savage, yet his bearing
in moments when others would have been melancholy,
was dignified and truly regal. Even though his
only covering was a loin-cloth and a piece of a white cotton
garment wrapped about his shoulders, Omar Sanom was
every inch a prince.</p>

<p>"If we made a dash for liberty we should, I fear, be
shot down like dogs," I said.</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered. "The country we shall now
traverse will not facilitate our flight, but the reverse.
From the edge of the Great Forest to Buna, beyond the
Kong mountains, it is mostly marshy hollows and pestilential
swamps, while the lands beyond Buna away to
Koranza, in Ashanti, are flat and open like your English
pastures. We will, if opportunity offers, endeavour to
escape, but even if we succeeded in eluding their
vigilance death lurks everywhere in a hundred different
forms."</p>

<p>"Well, at present we are slaves hounded on towards
the dreaded Golgotha of the Ashantis," I said. "We
have escaped one fate only to be threatened by one more
terrible."</p>

<p>"True," he answered. "But down on the Coast they
have an old proverb in the Negro-English jargon which
says, 'Softly, softly catchee monkey.' Let us proceed
cautiously, bear our trials with patience, seek not to
incense these brutal Arabs against us, and we may yet
tread the path that leads into my mother's kingdom.
Then, within a week, the war-drums will sound and we
will accompany our hosts against Samory and his hordes."</p>

<p>"I shall act as you direct," I replied. "If you
think that by patience all may come right no complaint<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a>[<a href="./images/71.png">71</a>]</span>
shall pass my lips. We are companions in misfortune,
therefore let us arm ourselves against despair."</p>

<p>The compact thus made, we endured the toil and
hardships of travel without murmur. At first our
bearded masters heaped upon the queen's son every indignity
they could devise, but finding they could not
incense him, nor cause him to utter complaint, ceased
their taunts and cuts from their loaded whips, and soon
began to treat us with less severity.</p>

<p>Yet the fatigues of that march were terrible. The
suffering I witnessed in that slave gang is still as vivid
in my memory as if it were only yesterday. Ere we had
passed through the great forest and gained the Kong
mountains, a dozen of our unfortunate companions who
had fallen sick had been left in the narrow path to be
eaten alive by the driver-ants and other insects in which
the gloomy depths abound, while during the twenty days
which the march to the Ashanti border occupied many
others succumbed to fever. Over all the marshes there
hung a thick white mist deadly to all, but the more so
to the starving wretches who came from the high lands
far north beyond the Niger. Scarcely a day broke
without one or more of the lean, weak negroes being
attacked, and as a sick slave is only an incumbrance,
they were left to die while we were marched onward.
Whose turn it might next be to be left behind to be
devoured alive none knew, and in this agony of fear and
suspense we pushed forward from day to day until we at
last reached the undulating grass-land that Omar told
me was within a few days' march of Kumassi.</p>

<p>Here, even if the sun blazed down upon us like a
ball of fire, it was far healthier than in the misty regions
of King Fever, and at the summit of a low grass-covered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a>[<a href="./images/72.png">72</a>]</span>
hill our captors halted for two days to allow us to recuperate,
fearing, we supposed, that our starved and weak
condition might be made an excuse for low prices.</p>

<p>Soon, however, we were goaded forward again, and ere
long, having traversed Mampon's country, entered the
capital of King Prempeh, slaves to be sacrificed at the
great annual custom.</p>

<p>No chance of escape had been afforded us. We were
driven forward to the doom to which the inhuman enemy
of the Naya of Mo had so ruthlessly consigned us.</p>



<hr class="full" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<h3>THE HUMAN SACRIFICE.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Kumassi</span>, the capital of the Ashanti kingdom, was, we
found, full of curious contrasts. We approached it
through dense high elephant grass, along a little beaten
foot-path strewn with fetish dolls. It was evening when
we entered it, and drums could be heard rumbling and
booming far and near. Presently we passed a cluster
of the usual mud huts, then another; several other
clusters were in sight with patches of high jungle grass
between. Then in a bare open space some two hundred
yards across, were huts, and more thatched roofs in the
hollow beyond. This was Kumassi.</p>

<p>During that day three of our fellow-sufferers, knowing
the horrible fate in store for them, managed to snatch
knives from the belts of our captors and commit suicide
before our eyes, preferring death by their own hands
to decapitation by the executioners of Prempeh, that
bloodthirsty monarch who has now happily been
deposed by the British Government, but who at that
time was sacrificing thousands of human lives annually,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a>[<a href="./images/73.png">73</a>]</span>
defiant and heedless of the remonstrances of civilized
nations.</p>

<p>In size Kumassi came up to the standard I had formed
of it. The streets were numerous, some half-dozen were
broad and uniform, the main avenue being some seventy
yards wide, and here and there along its length a great
patriarchal tree spread its branches. The houses were
wattled structures with alcoves and stuccoed fa&ccedil;ades,
embellished with Moorish designs and coloured with red
ochre. Red seemed the prevailing colour. Indeed it
is stated on good authority that on one occasion Prempeh
desired to stain the walls of his palace a darker red, and
used the blood of a thousand victims for that purpose.
Behind each of the pretentious buildings which fronted
the streets were grouped the huts of the domestics, inclosing
small courtyards.</p>

<p>Passing down this main avenue, where many people
watched our dismal procession, we came to the grove
whence issued the terrible smell which caused travellers
to describe Kumassi as a vast charnel-house; we, however,
did not halt there, but passed onward to the palace of
Prempeh, situated about three hundred yards away and
occupying a level area in the valley dividing the two
eminences on which the town is situated. The first view
of what was designated as the palace was a number of
houses with steep thatched roofs clustered together and
fenced around with split bamboo stakes, while at one
corner rose a square two-storeyed stone building. The
lower part of the lofty walls of stucco was stained deep
red, probably by blood, and the upper part whitewashed.</p>

<p>Presumably our captors had received a commission
from Prempeh to supply him with slaves for the sacrifice,
for we were marched into a small courtyard of the palace<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a>[<a href="./images/74.png">74</a>]</span>
itself and there allowed to rest until next day, being
given a plentiful supply of well-cooked <i>cankie</i>, or maize
pudding wrapped in plantain leaves. Our position was,
we knew, extremely critical. Attired in the merest
remnant of a waist cloth, with a thick noose of grass-rope
securely knotted around our necks, we lay in the
open court with the stars shining brilliantly above us,
unable to sleep from the intensity of our feelings. In
the next court there were more than a hundred unfortunates
like ourselves huddled together, ready to be
sacrificed on the morrow.</p>

<p>Soon after sunrise, while moodily awaiting our fate,
we were made to stand up for inspection by one of the
King's Ocras. These men were of three classes; the
first being relatives of the King and entrusted with
State secrets, were never sacrificed, the second were
certain soldiers appointed by the king, and the third
slaves. All, on account of their distinguished services,
were exempt from taxes, palavers and military services,
and were kept in splendid style by the Royal exchequer,
those of the inferior classes being expected to sacrifice
themselves upon the tomb of the king when he died.</p>

<p>The tall, rather handsome, man who inspected us was
an Ocra of the first class, for he wore a massive gold
circle like a quoit suspended around his neck by golden
chains, and, walking beneath an enormous, gaudily-coloured
silken umbrella bearing the crude device of a
crouching leopard, was attended by a numerous retinue,
who paid him the greatest respect.</p>

<p>The Arabs who had brought us there made him profound
obeisance, while some members of the retinue
snapped fingers with several of the Arabs, and the usual
teetotal ceremony of drinking water to "cool the heads"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a>[<a href="./images/75.png">75</a>]</span>
was gone through. The inspection was a keen one,
each of us being passed in review before the Ocra, who
made brief comments to the Arabs at his side. As
Omar passed the dark-faced official scrutinised him
carefully and seemed interested to learn what the leader
of the slave caravan told him in a tongue unknown to
me regarding us both, for his gaze wandered from my
companion to myself, and I was at once called out to
pass before his keen glance. We were both kept there
several minutes while the Arab presumably explained
how we had been entrapped at the court of Samory.
At last, however, we were allowed to retire, and very
soon afterwards the great Ocra moved forward into the
next court, followed by a couple of youths bearing long
knives and a thin, lean-looking wretch with a stool
curiously carved from a solid block of cotton wood,
richly embellished with gold ornaments.</p>

<p>When he had gone I cast myself upon the ground in
the shadow beside Omar, saying:</p>

<p>"After all, it would have been better if we had died
in the woods than to endure this torture of waiting for
execution."</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered, gloomily. "That Ocra who has
just inspected us was Betea, a bitter enemy of my
mother. He is certain to revenge himself upon us."</p>

<p>But even as he spoke we heard the adulatory shouts
of the royal crier somewhere in our vicinity. They
were more than sufficient to transform any man, white or
black, into a vain despot, and as translated by Omar
were in the strain of:</p>

<p>"O, King, thou art the king above all kings! Thou
art great! Thou art mighty! Thou art strong! Thou
hast done enough! The princes of the earth bow down<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a>[<a href="./images/76.png">76</a>]</span>
to thee, and humble themselves in the dust before
thy stool. Who is like unto the King of all the
Ashantis?"</p>

<p>It was the preliminary of the great sacrifice!</p>

<p>King Prempeh, though arrogant, vain and cruel beyond
measure, had, we afterwards saw, the eye of a king,
which means that it was the eye of one possessing
unlimited power over life and death. It was the custom
for the king to be placed on the stool by the united
voice of the chiefs; but immediately he was seated in
him became vested the supreme power.</p>

<p>Soon the firing of guns and the loud beating of the
great <i>kinkassis</i>, or drums ornamented with human
skulls, sounded outside the walls wherein we were confined,
while the air was rent by the wild yells of the
excited populace. For nearly an hour this continued,
and we thus remained in terrible suspense until at last
the gate opened, and with the grass ropes still around
our neck we were marched out of the palace under an
escort of the king's slaves.</p>

<p>Turning to the left along the broad avenue we saw
upon a long pole a human head grinning at us, two
vultures perched upon it eagerly stripping it. It was,
Omar told me, the head of a thief. The street was
crowded with people, who shouted to their gods as we
passed in procession, and presently we came to a great
fetish-gallows, from the cross beams of which hung the
decomposing body of a ram. Some of the men forming
our escort were a strangely-dressed set, their uniform
consisting of striped tunics reaching to the knee, confined
round the waist by belts profusely decorated with
strips of leopard skin and tiny brass bells which tinkled
musically as they moved. In their belts they carried<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a>[<a href="./images/77.png">77</a>]</span>
several knives, while the musket and the little round
cap of pangolin skin completed their equipment.</p>

<p>At last we reached the grove at Bantama on the out-skirts
of the town, one of the three execution places.
Several thousand people had assembled around a great
tree where a number of gorgeous umbrellas of every
hue and material had been erected. Many were ornamented
with curious devices, and the tops of some bore
little images of men and animals in gold and silver.
Under the centre umbrella, upon a brass-nailed chair
close to the tree, sat King Prempeh in regal splendour,
surrounded by a crowd of chiefs, whose golden
accoutrements glittered in the sun. Three scarlet-clad
dwarfs were dancing before him amid the dense crowd
of sword-bearers, fly-whiskers, court criers and minor
officials. As he sat there, his thin flabby yellow face
glistening with oil, he looked a truly regal figure, wearing
upon his head a high black and gold crown, and on his
neck and arms great golden beads and nuggets. His
habit was to suck a large nut that looked like a big
cigar, and as he sat there with it in his mouth it gave
his face a strangely idiotic expression.</p>

<p>The whole Ashanti court had assembled at the theatre
of human sacrifice.</p>

<p>As we approached the drumming grew louder, the
roar of voices filled the air, and the great coloured
umbrellas were seen whirling and bobbing above the
heads of the surging crowd of natives. The great
barrel-like drums, with their grim ornamentations,
boomed forth, and bands of elephant-tusk horns added
to the deafening din.</p>

<p>In the distance could be seen the great fetish-house,
with its enormous high thatched roof wherein was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a>[<a href="./images/78.png">78</a>]</span>
supposed to be hidden Prempeh's great treasures of
gold-dust and jewels. The ground whereon the glittering
court had assembled was covered with the skulls
and bones of thousands of former victims, and as we
advanced slowly through the turbulent crowd we saw a
sight that froze our blood. At the foot of the fetish
tree was placed a great brass execution-bowl, about five
feet in diameter. It was ornamented with four small
lions and a number of knobs all around its rim, except at
one part where there was a space for the victim's neck to
rest upon the edge. The blood of those sacrificed to the
gods was allowed to putrefy in this great bowl&mdash;which
has recently passed into the hands of the English, and
is now in London&mdash;and leaves of certain herbs being
added it was considered valuable as a fetish medicine.</p>

<p>As we entered the cleared space between the chiefs
and caboocers surrounding the King and the thousands
of warriors and spectators, salvo after salvo of musketry
was fired, until the smoke obscured all objects in our
immediate vicinity. Around the sacrificial bowl were
grouped a dozen or more royal executioners with their
faces whitewashed and hideously decorated. Some
upon their heads wore caps of monkey skin with the
face in front, while others had high head-dresses of
eagles' feathers, their tunics of long grasses being
covered with magical charms tied in little bunches. All
were copiously smeared with blood, while each wore a
necklace of human teeth, and carried a heavy broad-bladed
sword rusted by the blood of former victims.
Behind them were twenty or thirty Ashantis, each with
a knife stuck through both cheeks, to prevent the
unhappy victims from asking the King to spare their
lives, which, according to national law, must be granted,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a>[<a href="./images/79.png">79</a>]</span>
while a broad-bladed dagger was in many cases run
under the shoulder-blades. They were prisoners who
had tried to stir revolt, and were, we understood, to be
sacrificed first. Our turn would come later.</p>

<p>The scene was horrible; we were appalled. At a
signal from the King the first unfortunate wretch was
instantly seized by two executioners and held over the
bowl, while a third lifted his keen sword, and with a
dull, sickening thud brought it down upon the poor
fellow's neck, hacking into his spine until the head was
severed. Then there arose a loud shout of triumph.
The offering to the fetish was the signal for the most
enthusiastic rejoicing, and the shouts of adulation were
deafening. The people, ground down by a crafty priesthood,
and steeped in the most degrading superstitions,
looked upon the wholesale butchery that followed without
a shudder. King, courtiers and slaves seemed
seized with an insatiable desire for blood, and as one
head fell after another, the cries of the victims drowned
by the vociferous shouts of the onlookers, Omar and I
stood shackled and trembling.</p>

<p>One after another the victims were thrown across the
bowl and their life-blood gushed into it as the cruel
swords descended, while the King gloated over the
sight with an expression of pleasure upon his oily sinister
face, until the heap of headless trunks grew large, and
the number sacrificed must have been over a hundred.</p>

<p>Suddenly the chief executioner took one of his knives
which had a human skull upon the hilt, and holding it
up, commanded silence.</p>

<p>Then spoke the Ocra Betea, who, rising from his
stool, waved his hand across the veritable Golgotha,
crying:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a>[<a href="./images/80.png">80</a>]</span>
"Behold! Tremble! The King makes the great yam
custom. The death-drum beats, and to the fetish we
offer sacrifice. Who is so great as the King of all the
Ashantis, and who is so powerful as the fetish? Yonder
are the graves of the great kings, and the marks on
yonder walls show the number of men who were sacrificed
when their graves were watered. Listen! The
mighty King Prempeh is about to sacrifice. To-day he
sends five hundred men to the dark world as a thank
offering for the harvest, and as an offering to the fetish to
enable us to eat up our enemies, the whites. When our
mighty King says war, we will arm against them, and
their heads shall fill many baskets. Of a truth our lord
Prempeh is the greatest monarch who has ever sat upon
the stool. The earth quakes when he speaks, and his
enemies are paralysed by fear. Betea has spoken."</p>

<p>Then the crowd set up a series of wild shrieks and
yells, they gesticulated, fired guns indiscriminately, and
danced wildly, while some of the enthusiasts pressing
forward, dipped their hands into the blood already
in the bowl, and besmeared themselves with it; and
others, turning upon myself and my companion as we
stood silent and trembling, heaped every insult upon us.</p>

<p>In a few moments, however, the crowd was driven
back, and at a signal from the King the executions
recommenced, until the smell of blood grew sickening,
and the awful scene caused me to shake like an aspen.</p>

<p>I knew that nothing could save me from the hands
of these demoniacal whitewashed executioners, and in
a few moments I, a slave purchased like an ox for the
slaughter, would be borne down over the bowl and
decapitated.</p>

<p>I looked at Omar. His face was pale, but his lips<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a>[<a href="./images/81.png">81</a>]</span>
were tightly set, although there was an expression of
utter hopelessness upon his countenance.</p>

<p>The horror of that moment held me breathless.</p>



<hr class="full" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<h3>IN THE SACRED GROVE.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> by one the slaves of the gang in which we had
travelled were dragged forward, held over the execution
bowl and sent as messengers to spirit-land, until it came
to Omar's turn. In a second two white-faced demons
with keen swords seized him, and despite the cry for
mercy that escaped his lips, he was rushed forward, the
frenzied executioners flinging him down unceremoniously,
and bending his head over the warm blood with which
the basin was now filled to overflowing.</p>

<p>At that instant, as the chief executioner strode forward
and held his dripping blade uplifted, ready to strike,
the King raised his hand to command silence, and the
hideously-dressed official paused in wonder, his sword
poised in air.</p>

<p>Betea, the Ocra, bending low, was whispering to the
King, when the latter suddenly took the nut from his
mouth and said:</p>

<p>"So it is upon Omar, son of my enemy the Naya of
Mo, that my eyes rest! Let him stand forth with his
white companion."</p>

<p>Obedient to the command of the King, the executioners
allowed Omar to rise, and in a few moments we
both stood before the royal stool.</p>

<p>"How came you here?" asked Prempeh, scowling.</p>

<p>"I was captured and sold as slave to the Arab<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a>[<a href="./images/82.png">82</a>]</span>
dealers," he answered, drawing himself up with that
princely air he always assumed in moments of danger.</p>

<p>"And your white companion? How is it he is in our
capital?"</p>

<p>"I have been to the land of the white men across the
sea, and he returned as my friend," Omar replied.
"We were travelling homeward to Mo when by treachery
I was entrapped."</p>

<p>"By whom?"</p>

<p>"By Samory."</p>

<p>Across Prempeh's evil face there spread a sickly
smile. He was an ally of the great Mohammedan chief,
and saw at once that Samory had sold the son of their
mutual enemy into slavery.</p>

<p>"Your queen-mother," he said, "has times without
number sent her armed hordes over the border to raid
our villages, and it is the fetish that has delivered you,
her son, into our hands. The fetish has not sent you
hither as a sacrifice, but as a hostage. Therefore your
life shall be spared together with that of your white
friend, but you shall both be given as slaves to our
trusted Ocra Betea. Let the sacrifice proceed.
Prempeh, King of all the Ashantis, has spoken."</p>

<p>Next second a poor black wretch was dragged along
in Omar's place and the sword fell heavily upon him,
while we were both hurried away in charge of a caboocer
to the residence of the man who was, according to
Omar, one of his mother's bitterest foes. Glad were we
to escape with our lives from that awful scene of inhuman
butchery, but it seemed that as slaves of this
court favourite to whom we had been given, there would
be but little brightness in our lives.</p>

<p>As day succeeded day our gloomy forebodings were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a>[<a href="./images/83.png">83</a>]</span>
only too truly realized. Betea, the most powerful of
the King's Ocras, seemed to delight in making our lives
a burden to us, for amid luxurious surroundings we were
beaten, starved, and ill-treated, until even death under
the executioner's knife seemed a preferable fate.</p>

<p>Six months passed; six weary months of slavery and
wretchedness. Our position seemed absolutely hopeless,
and I began to fear that we should never escape from
the City of Blood. The scenes we witnessed there were
so revolting, that I cannot now reflect upon them without
a shudder. The ghastly "customs," the absence of
all protection for life and property, the grinding
oppression, the nameless horrors of all kinds, were
terrible. Blood was continually flowing, for every anniversary
demanded fresh holocausts, and the "Golgotha"
presented a sight of indescribable horror. The unwritten
code of laws were of such a sanguinary nature,
that the public executioners formed a numerous section
of the community and were constantly employed collecting
their victims, leading them for exhibition through
the capital and then hacking them to pieces in presence
of the king. Soldiers, slaves, retainers of the nobles and
conquered tribes possessed no defined rights, and their
lives and property were practically in the hands of the
royal and governing classes.</p>

<p>Close to the house of our inhuman master was the
fetish grove, a horrible place, surrounded by rank grass,
dirt, and reeking with odours pestilential. Once or
twice I wandered in that grove, treading upon human
bones at every step&mdash;the heaped-up remains of thousands
of miserable creatures slaughtered to please the
Ashanti ruler's lust for blood. Poor crumbling bones,
mouldy and sodden as the rotten wood of older trees,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a>[<a href="./images/84.png">84</a>]</span>
yet once clothed with form and vigour, lay everywhere,
while under the cotton wood trees skulls were heaped
and vultures hovered about in hundreds.</p>

<p>One evening we attended our master on one of his
official visits to Bantama, the fetish priest's village where
we so narrowly escaped execution, and were able to
thoroughly inspect the gruesome place. The most horrible
blood-orgies known to superstition and fetish-worship
were almost daily practised there, and in nearly every
abode there were stools and chairs smeared with human
blood, drinking bowls were stained with it, and some
vessels were half-filled with black clotted blood. In the
priests' inner chambers, dark dens filled with foul odours,
to which we entered with Betea, we found not only the
whole apartment smeared with blood, but bones and
portions of human remains lying about openly, or wrapped
in rags to serve as charms. One building, probably the
residence of one of the chief priests, was embellished
with mud-moulded panels and scroll work, and the
columns facing the principal quadrangle were fluted.
The colours were the prevailing white clay, and red
ochre plastered upon the wattle and mud pillars.</p>

<p>Suddenly, as in the dusk we left this house, a loud
horrible shriek sounded. At first we thought some poor
wretch was being sacrificed, but again and again it
sounded, and all turned pale, even the royal Ocra himself.</p>

<p>"What's that, I wonder?" I asked Omar, who,
bearing our master's sword, was walking at my side.</p>

<p>"The gree-gree!" he gasped, looking round in fear,
while at that moment there sounded two ear-piercing
blasts upon a horn.</p>

<p>"Hark!" cried Betea himself, trembling. "The
gree-gree is out to-night!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a>[<a href="./images/85.png">85</a>]</span>
I remembered that I had been told by one of our
fellow-slaves that the gree-gree was a great fetish who
appeared horned like a demon, and killed all persons he
came across. None dare lock their doors when the
gree-gree walked, and only the King himself was
invulnerable. This no doubt was another trick of the
priests to frighten the superstitious natives, and at the
same time wreak vengeance upon those who had offended
them. Once again the notes of the horn rose weird and
shrill, and died away. Then Betea, himself affrighted,
turned to us saying:</p>

<p>"Fly! fly for your lives. If the gree-gree catches
you you will be struck upon the brow. His arm deals
death everywhere."</p>

<p>In a moment all took to their heels, including the royal
Ocra, but Omar, grasping my arm, whispered excitedly:</p>

<p>"Stay. We may now escape."</p>

<p>As the words left his lips we caught sight of a weird
black figure dressed in long coarse grass, with rams'
horns upon his head, his face whitened and a second
pair of eyes painted over his own. In his hand gleamed
a long bright knife, while at his side was suspended a
freshly-severed human arm and hand. Yelling and
leaping like a veritable demon, he suddenly noticed the
flying figures of our fellow-slaves, and halting a moment,
dashed after them, leaving us alone.</p>

<p>"He will return here, so we must hide," Omar said
quickly, and glancing round, we both saw at the end of
the dark ghostly avenue of fetish-trees an oblong windowless
mud building with a high-pitched triple grass
thatched roof. Running towards it we managed to
wrench off the padlock from the door and enter. It
was, we discovered, the reputed sepulchre of the Ashanti<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a>[<a href="./images/86.png">86</a>]</span>
kings. Without, it was guarded by all sorts of fetish-charms,
extraordinary odds and ends, animals' claws,
broken pottery, scraps of tin, bits of wood, stones and
human bones. Within, by the aid of a lamp we found
burning were revealed several great coffers clamped with
copper and iron, each resting upon two big stools of
carved cotton-wood. Jars and vases filled with water
and wine, braziers full of sweet-smelling leaves, and
plates of food were placed beside each, offerings for the
use of the dead.</p>

<p>Omar told me that when an Ashanti king died, he was
buried in an ordinary coffin for a time, but afterwards
the body was invariably disinterred, and the joints of the
skeleton articulated with gold bands and wire. It was
then placed, doubled up, in one of these spacious coffers&mdash;fully
four feet long by two feet wide and deep&mdash;and the
other skeletons were attendants, slaughtered and sent to
the land of Shades to wait on the monarch's ghost.</p>

<p>"Possibly," I said, "much of the ghostly grimness
and worked-up horrors about this place are cunningly
devised, not only to protect the Royal tombs from being
plundered by the superstitious natives, but to help to
safeguard the State treasures concealed in yonder
coffins."</p>

<p>"Yes," he said. "In this priest-ridden country all
the superstition is heaped up for their benefit and profit.
But we must get out of here before dawn, run past the
gree-gree if he is about, and make a dash for the open
forest. It is our only chance of escape, for at dawn the
priests will come again to watch beside the tombs, and
if discovered we are certain to be skewered through the
mouth, dragged before Prempeh and hacked to pieces
by the criminal executioner."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a>[<a href="./images/87.png">87</a>]</span>
"Well, any fate is better than that," I observed. "Let
us wait an hour or so, and then make a rush for it."</p>

<p>"Very well," he answered, and together we resumed
the work of exploring the strange place.</p>

<p>Soon, however, our lamp burned dim, flickered, and
went out; then, after waiting in silence for half an hour
in the pitch darkness, we softly opened the door, and,
holding our breaths, crept out. With noiseless tread
we stole along the sacred grove and were nearly at the
end when, without warning, the hideous gree-gree, with
a fiendish yell of triumph, sprang out of some bushes
upon us.</p>

<p>Involuntarily, I put up my fist to ward off attack, and
in doing so gave him a well-directed blow full in the face,
sending him down flat on his back.</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" cried Omar in delight. "Floored him!
Let's run for our lives."</p>

<p>Ere the midnight murderer could spring to his feet,
we had dashed away as fast as our legs could carry us,
running along the fetish-grove, past the cluster of executioners'
houses, across the open space where in the
centre stood the great tree under which Prempeh had
sat to witness the wholesale sacrifice, and continuing
until we came to a path through the high elephant-grass,
we soon left the city far behind us, and plunged into
the dark, dismal forest by the narrow winding way that
led to the unexplored regions of the north.</p>

<p>When at length we paused to take breath Omar, panting,
said:</p>

<p>"At last we are free again. Betea will not seek us,
for he naturally believes we were killed by the gree-gree.
If Zomara favours us we shall yet live to enter Mo and
lead our hosts into the country of Samory."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a>[<a href="./images/88.png">88</a>]</span>
Then, taking from his neck a little bag of some
strange powder, he took therefrom a pinch, and with
fervent words scattered it to the four quarters of the
wind, thus making a thank-offering to the Crocodile-god.</p>

<h3>THE WAY OF THE THOUSAND STEPS.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">To</span> describe in detail our long toilsome journey and
the terrible hardships we suffered during the next two
months is unnecessary. Suffice it to say that without
means of barter, unarmed, and living upon fruit and
roots, we tramped along that narrow path through the
pestilential marshes and the great forests where no light
penetrated through the thick foliage of the giant trees
for several weeks, always due north and passing villages
sometimes, until we crossed the Sene river, ascended the
mountains beyond, and found ourselves upon a great
level grass-covered plateau, which occupied us several
days in traversing. At last we came to the border of
Prempeh's kingdom, crossed the Volta river that wound
in the brilliant sunlight for many miles like a golden
thread among the trees, and soon entered the fertile
country of the Dagombas, a wild-looking tribe who were
allies of the great Naya. At Yendi, seven days' march
through the bush from the Volta, we interviewed the
Dagomba king and received a most enthusiastic welcome.
Presents of food and slaves were given us, as well as a
musket each, with some curious ivory-hilted knives, and
we were treated as honoured guests of his sable majesty,
who, Omar informed me, was indebted to the Naya for
his royal position.</p>

<p>This welcome was therefore only what we expected,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a>[<a href="./images/89.png">89</a>]</span>
nevertheless, our life during the few days at Yendi was
of a very different character to the miserable existence
we had experienced during our long march to the confines
of Ashanti. But Omar was impatient to fulfil the
commands of his mother, and we did not remain longer
than was absolutely necessary, in order not to give
offence to the king; however, one morning we snapped
fingers with him and, with two hundred decidedly savage-looking
men as escort, we moved away still due north on
our journey to the mysterious land of the Great White
Queen.</p>

<p>The King of Dagomba had told me, in answer to my
enquiries, that neither himself nor any of his men had
ever entered Mo. The inhabitants were a very powerful
and fearless people, he knew, and their soldiers were
as numerous as an army of locusts. The men of Mo
were an admirable race, he added, and although no
stranger had ever been admitted to the mysterious realm,
yet its power was feared by every West African ruler
without exception.</p>

<p>It gratified me to think that I should be the first to
set foot within a land forbidden to any who had not been
born there, and I grew extremely impatient to set eyes
upon the country to the throne of which my light-hearted
friend Omar was heir. Travelling quickly, with
but few delays, we crossed the Busanga country, mainly
covered by dense, dark forest and unhealthy marshes,
where the odour of decayed vegetable matter was
sickening, until we came to a great mountain rearing
its snowy crest into the clouds, which Omar told me
was called the Nauri. Hence, when we had rested
two days to recruit in the sunlight after the dispiriting
gloom of the primeval forest, we held on our way,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a>[<a href="./images/90.png">90</a>]</span>
passing many native villages, the inhabitants of each
showing marked friendliness towards our Dagombas.</p>

<p>Kona, our headman, was a tall, pleasant-faced negro,
raw-boned and awkward, with huge hands and splay feet,
but his muscles were hard as iron and his strength astounding.
He treated Omar as a prince, always deferential to
his wishes, and regarded me as an honoured visitor to
the unknown but powerful protector of his sovereign.
Though fraught with many dangers on account of the
wild beasts lurking in the forests and the snakes on the
plains, our journey nevertheless proved extremely pleasant,
for in Kona we found a true and sympathetic friend.</p>

<p>Once he spoke to me of Queen Victoria, and his
words amused me. He said with impressive earnestness:</p>

<p>"Ah! The Queen of the English is, next to the
Great White Queen, the mightiest and cleverest woman
in the world. She sees the treasures in the interior of
the earth, and has them lifted. She spans the world
with iron threads, and when she touches them they
carry her words into the world. She has steamers
running on dry land. If a mountain is in her way she
has a hole made through it. If a river interferes, she
builds a road across in the air. And the Queen of the
English and the Great White Queen of Mo are richer
than all other women together. They are the most
beautiful women in the world, and their husbands paid
nothing for them."</p>

<p>When at night around our camp fire we would relate
to him the treachery of Kouaga, and our adventures in
the hands of Samory and Prempeh, he would stir the
embers viciously and call down the curse of Zomara
upon them all.</p>

<p>"When the son of the great Naya of Mo punishes his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a>[<a href="./images/91.png">91</a>]</span>
enemies, Kona will go and assist in their destruction," he
said one night. "Kona's knife shall seek their hearts."</p>

<p>"So it shall," Omar had replied, assured of the loyalty
of this negro ally. "You are our guide and friend; rest
assured that when we enter Mo you shall not be forgotten."</p>

<p>And we went forward next day all in excellent spirits,
all eager to enter the unknown land.</p>

<p>A few days' march from the mystic mountain of Nauri
we approached a little town called Imigu, but found it
had been sacked and burned, evidently by Arab slave-raiders,
who, Omar said, were constantly descending
upon the towns and villages on the border of his land.
At evening we went over the ruins of what not long ago
must have been a populous trading town, saw how wanton
had been the destruction, and judged from the heaps of
bleaching bones how terrible had been the butchery of
its inhabitants.</p>

<p>At dawn, however, we moved forward again, but at
noon, while we were descending a beautiful fertile valley
Kona stopped suddenly, gazed around wonderingly, and
then halting his men addressed them, telling them that
they were about to enter a country wherein no stranger
had ever before set foot, and urging them to patiently
face any difficulty they found in their path, and to offer
sacrifices of food to the fetish to give them strength to
surmount all obstacles.</p>

<p>Omar, with folded arms, stood by and listened. When
Kona had finished he raised his hand, saying:</p>

<p>"Men of the Dagomba. You have guided us to the
furthermost limit of the earth as known to you; in fact
to the point where your knowledge of this land ends and
mine commences. For this service you deserve reward,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a>[<a href="./images/92.png">92</a>]</span>
and I, Omar, Prince of Mo, promise that none who
have accompanied me hither shall leave the palace of the
Great White Queen without his just reward."</p>

<p>Two hundred black faces thereupon glistened with
delight. All were eager to see the wonders of this
much-talked-of country, but the promise of a reward at
the hands of the great queen was a pleasant surprise
that evoked the wildest enthusiasm. They yelled with
pleasure, bestowed upon us all the terms of adulation
until they exhausted their vocabulary, and blew their
elephants' tusks until I confess I was compelled to stuff
my fingers into my ears, fearing deafness.</p>

<p>"Lead us on, O our lord the prince!" they cried.
"Let us go forward. We will follow thee if thou wilt
point out the right path leading unto Mo, and appease
thy land's jealous guardians who smite back all would-be
intruders with swords of fire."</p>

<p>This latter was a tradition. I had heard it many
times during my journey with Omar. The natives of
Ashanti, of Kong, of Gurunsi, and of Dagomba, had all
told me that the country of Mo, wherever it might be
situated, was surrounded by a great cordon of guards&mdash;demons
they believed them to be&mdash;who had never
allowed a stranger to enter, for they simply lifted their
deadly swords that blazed like fire-brands, and slew the
offending wanderer.</p>

<p>"The guardians of Mo shall be appeased," Omar
assured them. "Not a hair on the head of any of our
party shall be injured, although the way is still long and
full of terrors and pitfalls. But I will lead, and those
who obey will enter Mo. Those who depart from my
words will assuredly perish. Omar, Prince of Mo, has
spoken."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a>[<a href="./images/93.png">93</a>]</span>
"May the fetish be good," they all cried aloud. "We
will follow and attend to each word that falleth from
thy lips."</p>

<p>Then in a few minutes we moved on again down the
long beautiful valley through which a clear river wound
among green swards and clumps of trees, forming a park-like
scene such as might have been witnessed in England.
Presently, however, the character of the country
suddenly changed, and we were passing through a rocky
defile, arid and waterless, while at the end could be seen
a wide open country without rock or tree stretching away
as far as the eye could reach to the misty horizon.</p>

<p>It appeared like a great limitless wilderness, and those
in front quickened their pace in order to fully view the
character of the land we were approaching.</p>

<p>For their haste, however, they received an unpleasant
reward.</p>

<p>When those who ran forward emerged into the open
plain, they suddenly found the soft earth give way
beneath their feet without warning, and ere they realized
their danger a dozen of them were struggling up to their
arm-pits in the sea of fine ever-shifting sand that seemed
kept in constant motion by some unknown natural
cause. With each movement they sank deeper, until,
fearing that the sandy quagmire would envelop and
suffocate them, they cried aloud for assistance. Help
was ready at hand, for the remainder of our followers
ran forward, and stretching forth ropes of monkey-creeper
were enabled to drag out their intrepid companions,
much to Omar's amusement.</p>

<p>"Those who deviate from the course that I myself take
will assuredly perish," he exclaimed a moment later.
Then, turning to me, he added: "This desert you see<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a>[<a href="./images/94.png">94</a>]</span>
before you is one of the barriers dividing my land from
those of our enemies. To those who know not the
secret it is impassable."</p>

<p>"Yes," I answered, surprised at the strange treacherous
character of the sand. "Those who ventured upon it
had narrow escapes."</p>

<p>"Exactly. Any weight upon its surface will sink to
the depth of many feet, sucked down as swiftly and
surely as a piece of wood is drawn down by a whirlpool.
In an attempt to cross this unsafe region many men have
lost their lives, for once upon its surface escape is impossible.
See!" And he cast his staff away upon the
sand. In an instant it had sunk out of sight.</p>

<p>"Then how shall we gain the land beyond?" I
asked in fear at the soft nature of the earth's surface.</p>

<p>"There is but one way. It is known only to the
Naya and to myself, and is called the Way of the
Thousand Steps. Its existence is preserved as a royal
secret in case my family are compelled at any time to fly
from our country, in which case they could escape safely,
while all their pursuers would assuredly be overwhelmed
and perish. For that reason the knowledge has been for
centuries solely in the keeping of the reigning Naya or
Naba. It was by this secret path that I left Mo and
came to you in England; by the same path I return."</p>

<p>"Lead the way. We will follow," I said.</p>

<p>"Come, men," he exclaimed, lifting his hand as he
addressed them. "Fear not, but follow so closely in
my footprints that your feet obliterate them, and I will
bridge the great gulf that lieth between Mo and the outer
world."</p>

<p>The mishap to the advance guard had evoked the
wildest speculations among the natives, and all were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a>[<a href="./images/95.png">95</a>]</span>
eagerly pressing forward, when, in a few moments, Omar
took up his position before them, and urging the utmost
caution held up the staff he took from my hand, taking
what appeared to be the bearings between his own eye
and the summit of a low mound far away on the horizon.
The preparations did not take long, and very soon, with
his staff held in the same position before him, he began
to venture forward upon the unsafe sand.</p>

<p>Carefully he trod the great treeless plain, being
followed by all in single file. With such caution did we
tread, and so excited were we all, that at first scarcely
was a word spoken. Very soon, however, with confidence
in Omar's leadership the natives grew hilarious
again, and keeping straight behind the young prince they
found the way, about a foot in width, hard, although dry,
and extremely unpleasant to tread. Nevertheless we all
were ready to encounter and overcome every obstacle
providing that we could enter the forbidden land, and
thus we went forward. Now and then one of the natives,
in speaking to the man next behind him, would turn and
thus deviate from the path over which Omar had passed,
and he would quickly pay for this carelessness, suddenly
finding himself floundering helplessly up to the ears in
the deadly quicksands. Then the whole of our party
would halt and, amid broad laughter and much ridicule,
the unfortunate one would be dragged forth from a
certain and terrible doom.</p>

<p>But the path was not straight. Heedless of the chatter
and excitement behind him Omar walked on before, his
staff raised on a level with his eye, counting aloud each
step he took, measuring the distance, until when he had
taken a thousand paces he suddenly stopped, examined the
ground well, and then turning at exact right angles, took<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a>[<a href="./images/96.png">96</a>]</span>
bearings by another mound that I had noticed far in the
distant haze.</p>

<p>Again and again we faced always at exact angles after
pacing a thousand steps, so that our path became a zig-zag
one, long and toilsome, with many halts, yet without
rest and without seeing anything beyond the wondrous
expanse of burning sky and the loose sand that swallowed
all things dead or living.</p>

<p>Everything thrown upon it sank and disappeared
almost as quickly as iron cast into water.</p>



<hr class="full" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<h3>FOES.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> we had been several hours upon our hot, tedious
journey there arose a quarrel out of a practical joke
played by one native upon the man walking before him.
Quick, hasty words led to blows being exchanged.</p>

<p>Both men were walking immediately in front of me,
and I did my best to quell the disturbance, but either
they did not understand me or affected ignorance of
my words, for suddenly one of them raising his spear leapt
forward upon the other. The man attacked sprang
aside and in so doing left the narrow path, at that spot
not more than twelve inches in width, followed by the
would-be assassin.</p>

<p>Next second they sank into the sand, and although
loud cries of horror escaped them, both disappeared into
the terrible gulf ere a hand could be outstretched to save
them. Hearing their cries I leant forward, but before I
could grasp either of them the fine sand had closed over
their heads like the waters of the sea, leaving a deep<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a>[<a href="./images/97.png">97</a>]</span>
round depression in the surface. They had disappeared
for ever.</p>

<p>The instant death of the two combatants before my
gaze caused me to shudder, and I confess that from that
moment I kept my eyes rivetted upon the strange
narrow path by which we were crossing the impassable
barrier.</p>

<p>Through three whole days we continued along the
Way of the Thousand Steps, resting at night and
journeying while the light lasted. To halt was even
more perilous than to progress, for when we encamped
we simply sat down upon the spot where our footsteps
had been arrested, and food was passed from hand to
hand along the line. This latter was somewhat unsatisfactory,
at least as far as I was concerned, for the
eatables that reached me were not improved by passing
through the hands of thirty or forty malodorous negroes.
But the fatality that had at first appalled us had now
been forgotten, and everyone kept a good heart. Led
by Omar we were approaching a land hitherto unknown;
a country reputed to be full of hidden wonders and
strange marvels, and all were, hour by hour, eagerly
scanning the mysterious horizon.</p>

<p>Across the level sand, swept by winds that parched
the lips and filled the eyes with fine dust, causing us
infinite misery, our gaze was ever turned northward
where Omar told us lay our land of promise. The very
last hesitations on the part of our followers had long been
overcome. The African savage is not given to roaming
far from his own tract, fearing capture or assassination at
the hands of neighbouring tribes, but such confidence had
the men of Dagomba that if Omar had plunged into the
quicksands they would have followed without comment.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a>[<a href="./images/98.png">98</a>]</span>
When at Trigger's I had often read stories of African
adventure. I used to fancy myself buried in forest
wilds, or eating luncheon upon the grass, on the edge of
a tumbling brook in the shadow of great outlandish
trees; I could feel the juice of luscious fruits&mdash;mangroves
and bananas&mdash;trickle between my teeth. I had
once read in one of the boys' papers about the daughter
of an African colonist abducted by the son of a West
African king who had fallen in love with her; and the
ups and downs and ins and outs of this love drama had
opened a boundless vista to my imagination. But life
in Africa contained far more excitement than I had ever
imagined. Death threatened everywhere, and I received
constant warnings from Omar, who gave me good advice
how to avoid sunstroke or ward off the effects of the chill
wind that blew nightly across this wonderful limitless plain.</p>

<p>One evening, when the horizon northward looked grey
and mysterious, and to our left the fiery sun's last dying
ray still lingered in the sky, there was a sudden halt,
the cause of which was I afterwards found due to
the sudden stoppage of our leader, Omar. All were
eager to know the cause, until in a few moments
an amazing announcement spread from mouth to mouth
along the line.</p>

<p>There were strangers on ahead of us! They were
actually traversing the Way of the Thousand Steps!</p>

<p>Shading my eyes with my hands I eagerly scanned
the horizon in the direction indicated, and there, to my
astonishment, saw a long thin black line. At first I
could not distinguish whether it was a file of men or
some inanimate object, but the keen eyes of the
savages before and behind me soon detected its
presence, and dozens of voices were in accord that it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a>[<a href="./images/99.png">99</a>]</span>
was a line of armed men, and that they were moving in
our direction.</p>

<p>Instantly it flashed across my mind that whoever they
were, friends or foes, there was not sufficient room for
them to pass us upon that narrow path, and knowing
the determination of our followers I wondered what
the result would be when we met. Unable to approach
Omar sufficiently near to converse with him, I watched
his face. By the heavy look upon his brow I knew
that trouble was brewing. It was the same look his
face wore when we had been held captive at Kumassi,
an expression of resolution and fierce combativeness.</p>

<p>Soon, however, we moved along again, eager to
ascertain who were the strangers who knew the secret
supposed to have been jealously guarded by the great
Naya and her son, and for over an hour pressed forward
at a quicker pace than usual. Fortunately for us the
sunset lingered long away to our left, for by its light
we were enabled to see the men approaching, and before
it died out to distinguish, to our amazement, that they
all wore white Arab burnouses and were armed to
the teeth. In point of numbers they were quite double
the strength of our little force, but we knew not whether
they were friendly or antagonistic.</p>

<p>This point, however, was at last cleared up by Omar
himself, who, just as it was growing dusk halted, and,
turning towards me, shouted in English:</p>

<p>"Scars, are you there?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I answered. "What's up?"</p>

<p>"Those devils in front! Can't you see their banner?"</p>

<p>"No," I answered. Then remembering that he
had always possessed a keen vision, I added: "Who
are they?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a>[<a href="./images/100.png">100</a>]</span>
"Some of Samory's men, evidently in flight," he
answered. "On seeing us they raised their banner,
and are, it seems, determined to cut their way past us."</p>

<p>"But where have they been that they should know the
secret of the Thousand Steps?" I inquired astounded.</p>

<p>"I'm quite at a loss to understand," he replied
puzzled. "The only solution of the mystery seems to
be that Kouaga has, by some means, obtained knowledge
of the secret way, and has directed a marauding force
thither. Evidently they have been defeated by the
guardians of Mo, and the remnant of the force&mdash;a
strong one, too&mdash;are retreating, flying for their lives."</p>

<p>"How do you know there has been fighting?" I
enquired.</p>

<p>"Because I can just detect near the banner two
wounded men are being carried."</p>

<p>"Then we must fight and wipe them out," I said.</p>

<p>"Easier said than done," he answered. "But it
means life or death to us."</p>

<p>On they came in single file, nearer every moment,
and soon I also could see the dreaded banner of the
Mohammedan sheikh Samory. Near the flag-bearer were
several wounded men being carried in litters, while
the white-robed soldiers carried long rifles and in their
sashes were pistols, and those keen carved knives called
<i>jambiyahs</i>. At first our natives, believing that they
were friendlies, went forward enthusiastically, determined
to drive them back with banter, there not
being room to pass, but very soon Omar ordered
another halt, and turning towards us, cried in a loud
voice in his native tongue:</p>

<p>"Behold, O men of the Dagomba! Yonder are the
fighting men of Samory, who times without number<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a>[<a href="./images/101.png">101</a>]</span>
have raided your country, killed your fathers and sons,
and sold your wives and sisters into slavery in Ashanti.
They have endeavoured to enter Mo by the Way of the
Thousand Steps, but being defeated by the guardians of
our border are flying towards their own land. We too
must fight them, or we must perish."</p>

<p>The air was immediately filled with fierce howls and
yells. The announcement that these men were the
hated slave-raiders of Samory caused an instant rush to
arms. Loud cries of revenge sounded on every side,
spears were flourished, knives gripped in fierce determination,
and those who had muskets made certain
that their weapons were loaded. The air was rent by
shrill war shouts, and the great drum with its hideous
decorations was thumped loudly by two perspiring
negroes who grinned hideously as they watched the
steadily marching force approaching.</p>

<p>"Courage, men of the Dagomba," sounded Kona's
voice above the din. "Sweep these vermin from our
path. Let not a single man escape; but let them all be
swallowed by the Sand-God."</p>

<p>"We will eat them up," cried half-a-dozen voices in
response. "Our spears shall seek their vitals."</p>

<p>"Guard against their onward rush," cried Omar.
"They will seek to throw us off the path by a dash
forward. Thwart them, and victory is ours."</p>

<p>Ere these words had left our leader's lips, the air was
again filled by the wild clamours of my dark companions,
and as we had halted just at a point where we
would be compelled to turn at right angles, we remained
there in order to attack the Arabs as they advanced.</p>

<p>The sun's glow had faded, dark clouds had come up
on the mystic line where sand and sky united, and dusk<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a>[<a href="./images/102.png">102</a>]</span>
was creeping on apace when the enemy, sweeping forward,
shouting and gesticulating, came within gunshot<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: added missing period">.</ins>
From their van a single flash showed for an instant,
followed by the sharp crack of a musket, and a bullet
whizzed past Omar, striking one of the natives a few
yards away, passing through his brain and killing him
instantly.</p>

<p>A silence, deep and complete, fell for an instant upon
us. In that exciting moment we knew that the fight
must be fiercely contested, and that, unable to move
scarcely an inch from the spot where we were standing,
the struggle must be long and sanguinary.</p>



<hr class="full" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<h3>A NATURAL GRAVE.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> single shot from our opponents was quickly replied
to by myself and my companions, and we had the
satisfaction of seeing half-a-dozen Arabs fall backward
from the path and disappear in the soft sand. Instantly
the rattle of musketry was deafening, and over my head
bullets whistled unpleasantly close. The weapon with
which I was armed was old-fashioned, and as I fired it
time after time it grew hot, and the smoke became so
thick that everything was obscured.</p>

<p>Meanwhile fierce hand-to-hand fighting was taking
place between the vanguard of the Arabs and a dozen
of our men led by Omar. Fiendish yells and shouts
sounded on every side as they hacked at each other with
their long curved knives, each fearing to step aside lest he
should be swallowed by the sand. Once or twice, as
the chill night wind parted the smoke, I saw Omar and
our Dagombas struggling bravely against fearful odds.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a>[<a href="./images/103.png">103</a>]</span>
Omar had cast aside his gun and, armed with a keen
<i>jambiyah</i>, had engaged two tall, muscular Arabs, both
of whom he succeeded in hurling from the path, gashed
and bleeding, to instant death.</p>

<p>Those behind him, armed with long spears with flat
double-edged points similar to the assegais of the Zulus,
were enabled to reach and dispatch several of the Arabs
who had lost their guns or discarded their pistols for
their knives. Situated as we were on the angle of the
secret path the enemy were to our right. Their fire
upon us was very hot and effective. Their aim was so
true and their bullets so deadly, that very soon fully a
dozen of our brave escort had sunk wounded, disappearing
in the terrible sea of sand.</p>

<p>Suddenly a noise sounded about me like the swish of
the sea, startling me for a second, but instantly I saw
what had caused it. The Dagombas had let loose a
flight of poisoned arrows upon our opponents.</p>

<p>From that moment their fire became weaker, and
time after time my companions, kneeling upon the
ground, drew their bows and released those terrible
darts, the slightest scratch from which produced tetanus
and almost instant death. Each arrow was smeared
with a dark red substance, and their deadly effect was
sufficiently proved by the manner in which the ranks of
Samory's men were soon decimated. Dozens of Arabs,
touched by the poisonous darts, staggered unevenly, and
falling to earth sank into the unstable sand, while the
red flash of their line of muskets visibly decreased.</p>

<p>Around Omar our men pressed valiantly, and several
with bows discharged their missiles with fatal effect,
sweeping away the Arabs one by one and apparently
striking terror into the hearts of the others. Arabs are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a>[<a href="./images/104.png">104</a>]</span>
not so vulnerable by arrows as other people on account
of their voluminous robes, which savage weapons seldom
penetrate, it being only head, legs and hands that
arrows can reach. Nevertheless so full were the quivers
of our sable escort, that the flights were of sufficient
magnitude to reach the unprotected parts of the Arabs
and lay dozens of them low.</p>

<p>One native next me, whose bow had constantly been
bent, suddenly received a bullet full in the breast and
was knocked backward off his feet by the concussion.
So swiftly was he swallowed by the shifting sand,
that ere I could glance behind he had already been
buried. Of all who fell, not a single body remained, for
if they dropped dead upon the path they were pushed
aside in the <i>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</i> and instantly disappeared. Again and
again our companions sent up their shrill yells and the
war-drum was thumped with ear-piercing effect, while
opposition shouts rose from our Arab enemies. Still the
fight continued as stubborn as it had begun. Omar,
with loud shouts of encouragement, fought on with unerring
hand, cutting, thrusting and hacking at his
opponents until they stumbled to their doom, while
across our line of vision where the fire of Arab musketry
blazed in the choking smoke, the thin deadly arrows
sped, striking our enemies and sweeping them into a
natural grave.</p>

<p>Fearing to tread lest I should fall into the terrible
quicksand, I knelt and kept up a continuous fire with
my musket, shooting into the dense smoke whenever I
saw the flash of an Arab gun. It was exciting work, not
knowing from one second to another whether the ping of
a bullet would bring death. Still I knew that to save
our own lives we must sweep away the host of invaders,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a>[<a href="./images/105.png">105</a>]</span>
and, reassured by the knowledge that Omar had met
with no mishap, I kept on, heedless of all dangers,
thinking only of the ultimate rout of our enemy.</p>

<p>How long the terrible fight lasted I know not. We
stood our ground, the majority of us kneeling, engaging
the Arabs in mortal combat for, I believe, considerably
over an hour. Several times the firing seemed so strong
that I feared we should be vanquished, nevertheless the
Dagombas proved themselves a valiant, stubborn race,
well versed in savage warfare, for the manner in which
they shot their arrows was admirable, and even at the
decisive moment when all seemed against us they never
wavered, but kept on, fierce and revengeful as in the
first moments of the fight.</p>

<p>Gradually, when Omar's voice had been heard a dozen
times urging us on to sweep every invader from our path
and not to let a single man escape, we found our enemy's
fire slackening. The smoke, moved by the sand-laden
wind that swept across the plain each night after sundown,
became less dense, and at last we realized that the
tide of battle had turned in our favour, and that we
were conquerors.</p>

<p>Then, loud fierce yells rose from the Dagombas and
with one accord we struggled to our feet. Each with
his hand upon the shoulder of his companion in front
we moved cautiously forward, shooting now and then
as we went. But the reply to our fire was now spasmodic,
and we were convinced that only a few of the
Arabs survived.</p>

<p>For some minutes we ceased the struggle and moved
forward, but suddenly, to our amazement, a long line of
muskets again blazed forth upon us, committing serious
havoc in our ranks. We were victims of a ruse!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a>[<a href="./images/106.png">106</a>]</span>
This aroused the anger of the Dagombas, who recommenced
the fight with almost demoniacal fierceness, and
as the van of both forces struggled hand-to-hand, we
found ourselves slowly but surely gaining ground until
half an hour later we were standing upon the path where
our enemies had stood when they had attacked us, and
of that long line of Samory's picked fighting-men not a
single survivor remained.</p>

<p>We had given no quarter. All had been swallowed in
that awful gulf of ever-shifting sand. When we had
thoroughly convinced ourselves of this we threw ourselves
down upon the narrow pathway, and slept heavily till dawn.</p>

<p>When I awoke and gazed eagerly around, I saw that
although a number of our men were wounded, their limbs
being hastily bandaged, yet few were missing. Of our
enemies, however, all had either fallen wounded, or
had been hurled from the secret path and overwhelmed
by the sand.</p>

<p>A high wind constantly blew, and I noticed that this
kept the grains of sand always in motion, thus preventing
the surface from solidifying. Waves appeared every
moment, ever changing and disappearing in a manner
amazing. At one moment a high ridge would be seen
before us, appearing as a formidable obstacle to our
progress, yet a moment later it would be swept away by
an invisible force.</p>

<p>The rosy flush of dawn had been superseded by the
saffron tints that are precursory of the sun's appearance
when we moved forward again on our cautious march.
Our companions, though far from fresh and many of
them seriously wounded, were all in highest spirits
and full of their brilliant victory. It had indeed
been a gratifying achievement, and now, feeling that at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a>[<a href="./images/107.png">107</a>]</span>
least their gods were favourable to their journey, they
pushed forward with eyes scanning the far-off horizon
where lay the mysterious realm.</p>

<p>During our march that day, Kona, the headman of the
Dagombas, on account of three men behind me having
fallen in the fight, occupied a place immediately at my rear,
and thus I was enabled to hold conversation with him.</p>

<p>"It was a near thing, that fight last night," he exclaimed
in the language that Omar had taught me. "But
our arrows wrought surer execution than the Arab bullets.
The desert-dwellers are no match for the forest-people."</p>

<p>"No," I answered. "Your men are indeed brave
fellows, and are entitled to substantial reward."</p>

<p>"I have no fear of that," he said. "The great Naya
is always just. She stretches forth her powerful hand to
protect the weaker tribes, and smites the raiders with
sword and pestilence. What her son promises is her
promise. Her word is never broken."</p>

<p>"Have you ever seen her?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"Never. Our king once saw one of her messengers
who brought the royal staff and made palaver. To us,
as to all other men outside her country, she is known
as the Great White Queen."</p>

<p>"Tell me what more you know of her?" I urged.</p>

<p>"Very little," he answered. "In every part of the
land, from the great black waters to the Niger and far
beyond, even to the sun-scorched country of the Maghrib,
her fame is known to all men. She is rich, mighty and
mysterious. Her power is dreaded throughout the
forests and the grass-plains, and it is said that in her
wrath her voice is so terrible that even the mountains
quake with fear."</p>

<p>"By what means do her fighting-men come forth from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a>[<a href="./images/108.png">108</a>]</span>
her unapproachable land?" I inquired, remembering
that we were travelling by the secret way known only to
herself and Omar.</p>

<p>"I know not," he replied. "The manner in which the
hosts of Mo appear and disappear have, from time
immemorial, formed a subject of speculation among our
people. That they have appeared on the Ashanti border
and sacked and burned many towns in retaliation for
some outrages committed by the Ashantis upon our
people is well-known, but by what route they came or
returned is a mystery. Some say they came like flocks
of birds through the air; others declare that they
can transfer themselves from one place to another and
become invisible at will. Neither of these theories I
myself believe, for I am convinced that between the land
of Mo and the Great Salt Road there exists a secret
means of communication, so that the armies of the Naya
can appear so suddenly and unexpectedly as to escape
the vigilance of their enemy's scouts. Many are the
battles they have fought and great the slaughter. In the
slave-land of Samory they engaged twelve moons ago the
pick of the Arab army, and defeated them with appalling
loss. It is said, too, that they carry some of the strange
guns made by your people, the white men."</p>

<p>"You mean Maxims," I said<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: added missing period">.</ins></p>

<p>"I know not their name, nor have I ever seen one," he
answered. "I have heard, however, from a Sofa who
fought against the English in the last war, that the
weapons are so light that a man can easily carry one, and
that when fired they shed streams of bullets like water
from a spout. A single gun is equal to the fire of two hundred
men. Truly you white men possess many marvels."</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, smiling at his unbounded admiration<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a>[<a href="./images/109.png">109</a>]</span>
for the weapon. "But is it not strange that the Naya
should also possess similar marvels?"</p>

<p>"No. Everything is strange in the land of the Great
White Queen. It is said to be a country full of amazing
mysteries. Many are the extraordinary stories related by
my people of the wonders of Mo; wonders that we shall
ere long witness with our own eyes."</p>

<p>"What are the stories?" I asked, keenly interested<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: added missing period">.</ins>
"Tell me one."</p>

<p>"There are so many," he answered, "I do not know
which one to tell. One, however, will illustrate the awe
with which the Naya is regarded, even by the powerful
Prempeh, King of Ashanti. A story is current that one
day, many moons ago, the King had ordered a great
'custom' to take place in Kumassi. War had been
declared against the Queen of the English, and in order
to obtain the good graces of the fetish a thousand slaves
were ordered to be sacrificed. All was ready and the
king sat upon his stool awaiting the decapitation of the
first victim, when suddenly there swept down from above
a large white dove, which, after circling for a moment
above the monarch's umbrella, perched upon the edge of
the execution bowl. The executioner swept it aside with
his ready sword, but in an instant, by some invisible
power, the broad-bladed weapon fused and melted as if
in a furnace, while the executioner himself, struck down
as if by lightning, fell upon his face stone dead. Still
the dove remained where it had perched with its head
turned towards the ruler of the Ashantis. A second
executioner, ere it was discovered that the first was dead,
struck at the bird with his hand, and he too, as well as a
third and fourth, were similarly smitten with death. 'It
is an evil omen!' the people cried, and Prempeh, his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a>[<a href="./images/110.png">110</a>]</span>
eyes rivetted upon the white, innocent-looking bird,
trembled. Suddenly, one of the sages at the king's right
hand cried: 'See, O Master! It is the Great White
Queen, the ruler of Mo! She taketh the form of a dove
when she seeketh the destruction of her enemies!' Then
spake the dove, saying: 'Yea, O hated king who sheddeth
the blood of the innocent and exalteth the guilty<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: added missing period">.</ins>
The sacrifice of victims to the fetish shall not avail thee,
for I, Naya of Mo, tell thee that thy downfall is at hand,
and thine enemies the English will press their way from
the great sea, bridge the Prah, and cut a road across the
great forest to this thy capital, where thou shalt make
abject submission to their head-man and shall be carried
into degrading captivity by them. Thy treasures shall
be seized, the tombs of thy fathers shall be opened and
desecrated, thy fetish-trees shall be cut down and thy
slaves shall revel in thy palace. And it is I, in my present
form, who shall guide the white men unto their victory.'
The king, dumbfounded at these ominous words proceeding
from the beak of a bird, rose to retort, but ere a
word left his mouth the dove spread its wings and flew
away northward in the direction of the land we are now
approaching."</p>

<p>"That's merely a tale," I observed, laughing at this
latest illustration of the African's belief in the impossible<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: added missing period">.</ins></p>

<p>"Of course. You asked me for one of the stories told
by our people," Kona said. "I have told you one."</p>

<p>"Do you believe that this Great White Queen is invested
with such extraordinary power that she can cause
herself to be invisible, and while bringing destruction to
her enemies, assist her friends?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I know not what to believe," he replied in honest
bewilderment. "So many are the tales I have heard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a>[<a href="./images/111.png">111</a>]</span>
that I find it impossible to believe all, and have ended
by disbelieving most. Many of the men with us firmly
believe at this moment that the Naya, invisible, is at our
head guiding her son across the Way of the Thousand
Steps, and that to her our victory last night was due.
Our fate lies in her hands."</p>

<p>"Well," I answered, amused, "it matters not who
leads us so long as we enter the promised land. At
any rate we could have no better nor more trustworthy
guide than he who is at our head."</p>

<p>Next second, a loud cry from Omar attracted our
attention.</p>



<hr class="full" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<h3>WORDS OF FIRE.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Raising</span> our eyes from the straight narrow path whereon
we set our feet in the footprints of those before us, we
halted and looked eagerly ahead.</p>

<p>We had come to the edge of what seemed a shallow
depression, and already Omar had disappeared from
view, followed cautiously by those immediately behind
him. Owing to the cries of warning and astonishment
from each man who reached the edge, I advanced,
carefully following my black companion in front until
I at length gained the spot where the path ended.</p>

<p>Involuntarily a cry of amazement escaped me. I
looked over into a fearful abyss. Below was a fertile
valley, but so deep was it that the river looked only like
a silver thread, and the trees but an inch in height. I
was standing on the edge of a huge granite cliff that went
down sheer into the valley, its face almost as flat as the
side of a house.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a>[<a href="./images/112.png">112</a>]</span>
The descent appeared terrible. I shuddered as I
looked over, and Kona, who came behind me, also
peeped down and cried:</p>

<p>"See! It is the Great Gulf about which we have
heard. Into this the Naya hurls her enemies."</p>

<p>On the opposite side, about a quarter of a mile distant,
gigantic overhanging crags rose from the valley to a height
greater than the rock whereon we were kneeling. At a
glance we could both see that to scale the wall of rock
opposite would be impossible owing to its overhanging
nature, therefore, we concluded that our way lay along
the fertile valley where the cool welcome green refreshed
our eyes.</p>

<p>Already Omar and a couple of dozen of our black
followers were carefully swarming down the face of the
rock. Now and then warning shouts arose from them,
and ever and anon Omar's voice could be heard giving
directions, or urging caution. The latter was certainly
necessary, for a single false step would mean a terrible
death.</p>

<p>As I gazed down into the deep abyss I felt my head
reeling. There is a fascination in great heights that
impels one to thoughts of self-destruction. A sudden
dizziness seized me as I placed my foot over the edge
of the fearful precipice, and were it not for Kona, who,
noticing my condition, gripped me by the arm, I should
have certainly missed my footing and been dashed to
pieces on the needle-like crags at the base.</p>

<p>The sudden knowledge that I had been within an ace
of death caused me to hold my breath; then I crept
cautiously over the edge. For a moment, with my
hands clutching frantically upon a jutting piece of rock,
my legs swung in mid air, failing to find a foothold, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a>[<a href="./images/113.png">113</a>]</span>
I cried out, fearing lest I should again fall. But at last
my feet struck against a projection, and upon it I carefully
lowered myself, while Kona also swung himself
over, taking the perilous position I had a moment before
occupied. Again and again I lowered myself, gripping
on to the successive projections, and lowering myself
until my feet touched the one below, thus descending as
Omar had done.</p>

<p>"Be careful, Scars," he presently cried from far below.
"Drop straight, and look to your footing."</p>

<p>His words caused me to reflect upon the strange fact
that each of these projections, almost like natural steps,
were placed immediately below one another. Whether
they were actually natural formations, or whether they
were the work of man I could not determine. Yet they
seemed interminable, and sometimes so far apart that I
remained stationary, fearing to let myself go until, urged
downward by Kona, I held my breath, and, steadying
myself, dropped upon the narrow ledge below. Dreading
a recurrence of giddiness I dared not to look down
at my companions. My bare feet and hands were
blistered and cut by the sharp edges of the rocks, and
my movements were seriously hampered by the musket
slung at my back.</p>

<p>The descent was terribly fatiguing. The way across
the quicksands had been so level that we had walked,
counting our paces mechanically, but now in every
movement there was danger, and terror gripped my
heart with a gauntlet of steel. From every pore there
broke from me a cold perspiration, as from each tiny
projection I lowered myself, not knowing whether my
feet would find another resting-place. For my black
companions, who were taller and more muscular, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a>[<a href="./images/114.png">114</a>]</span>
way was not nearly so difficult, and Kona, aware of this,
assisted me whenever possible.</p>

<p>Once, when I found myself progressing well, and
apparently having successfully negotiated the more dangerous
of these natural steps, I paused for a few moments
to breathe, and, summoning courage, looked down
to where the others were scrambling below. I was then
amazed to discover that, notwithstanding all the fatigue,
the distance I had covered was scarcely perceptible. I
still seemed almost as far from the base of the rock as I
was when first I had peered over into the abyss. Suddenly,
without warning, I felt the rock give way beneath
my feet, and the next instant the whole projection,
loosened by the weight of Omar and his followers who
had preceded me, fell away beneath me, and crashed
straight down into the valley.</p>

<p>My presence of mind caused me just at that instant
to grip the ledge above, otherwise I, too, must have gone
with my unstable resting-place. It was indeed a narrow
escape, and as clinging on with my hands, my legs again
swinging in mid air, I heard the heavy rock, weighing
perhaps a ton, strike a projection under me and then
crash down, carrying all before it.</p>

<p>There was an appalling shriek from below, and I
dreaded to turn my gaze downward, fearing that my
companions had been swept away by the great mass of
stone. At last, however, I looked in trepidation and
was gratified to notice that the projection struck by the
rock had been left by the man preceding me, and that
the course of the descending stone had been altered so
that all had escaped.</p>

<p>"Careful up there!" shouted Omar angrily. "Don't
spring upon the steps, or they will become loosened like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a>[<a href="./images/115.png">115</a>]</span>
that one. It might have swept the whole lot of us into
the valley if its course had not been turned. Lower
yourselves slowly&mdash;very slowly&mdash;take plenty of time."</p>

<p>"I did it, Omar," I cried breathlessly. "It was an
accident. I could not avoid it, and nearly fell, too."</p>

<p>But it was apparent that my voice did not reach him,
for he slowly lowered himself over the next projection,
and continued giving directions to the men who followed,
while I, with the next ledge fallen away, was compelled
to let myself drop a distance of about nine feet on to
one that seemed far below.</p>

<p>From that point the descent became much easier,
although during the two hours it occupied I stumbled
and nearly lost my foothold many times. My feet and
hands were covered with blood, my elbows were severely
grazed, and from my knees the skin was torn by the
constant scrambling over the edges of the ledges.</p>

<p>Truly the approach to the Land of the Great White
Queen was fraught with a myriad dangers.</p>

<p>When about half-way down the steep rock another
piercing shriek broke forth immediately below me, and
glancing down I saw one of our black companions who
had dropped from one ledge to the next lose his footing,
stumble, and fall headlong into the great chasm. Cries of
horror escaped us as we saw him strike a rugged ledge
of rock far below, rebound, and then fall head foremost
to the rock's base, his skull already battered to a pulp.</p>

<p>This terrible lesson was heeded by everyone, and for
fully half an hour the silence was almost complete, save
for the gasps and hard breathing of our followers as they
toiled onward down the steep face of the gigantic rock.</p>

<p>Someone cried out that here, as across the quicksands,
there were a thousand steps. If this were true, as I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a>[<a href="./images/116.png">116</a>]</span>
believe it was, then the average distance between the
ledges being about five feet, the height of the rock was
somewhere about five thousand feet. When progress
at last became easier, I tried to attract Omar's attention,
and inquire whether we should have to scale the rock
opposite, but I could not project my voice far enough
below to reach him. When he shouted I could hear,
as his voice ascended, but he apparently could not distinguish
what I said in reply.</p>

<p>Kona, his bow and empty quiver slung behind him,
scrambled down after me ever nimble as a cat. His
black skin shone like ebony, but here and there were
cuts from which blood freely flowed, showing that
he too, although inured to a savage life, had not
altogether escaped in this struggle to enter the land
unknown.</p>

<p>As we approached the base the ledges became more
frequent, and hastening in my downward climb I at last
experienced gratification at finding the peril past, and
myself standing at the foot of the great precipice.</p>

<p>"Well?" asked Omar, approaching me quickly.
"How did you fare?"</p>

<p>"Badly," I answered with a smile. "A dozen times
I gave myself up for lost."</p>

<p>"Care and courage may accomplish everything," he
said, laughing. "Few, however, would care to risk the
perils of the Thousand Steps without a guide, or even
if they did, and succeeded in accomplishing the journey
to this point, they could not enter our land."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>He turned towards the flat, bare face of overhanging
rock opposite, and gazing up to its towering summit,
answered:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a>[<a href="./images/117.png">117</a>]</span>
"Because our land lies yonder. We must, after
resting, ascend."</p>

<p>"How?" I inquired, noticing that the wall of the
great cliff was perfectly smooth.</p>

<p>He smiled.</p>

<p>"Be patient, and you shall see. Only friends can
enter Mo; an enemy never."</p>

<p>At that moment Kona desired to consult him regarding
our camping arrangements, and turning I left them
and wandered a little way along the valley. Presently,
although its fertility was pleasant, I noticed that the air
had a strange f&oelig;tid odour, and, shortly afterwards, while
walking in the long rank grass my feet struck against
something, which, on examination, I found to be the
decomposing body of a man. He wore a burnouse, and
from the long-barrelled musket that lay by his side I
concluded it was an Arab. As I went forward I discovered
bodies scattered in twos and threes over the
grass-plain. Great grey vultures were tearing the rotting
flesh from the bones, feasting upon the carrion. Broken
guns, bent swords and blunted daggers lay about in
profusion, while the further I went, the more numerous
became the hideous bodies which the long grass seemed
to be striving to hide. This was assuredly the battle-field
whereon the army of the Great White Queen had
defeated the expedition sent by Samory. Truly the
slaughter must have been appalling, and little wonder
was it that the survivors whom we had met and annihilated
should have fought so desperately for their lives.</p>

<p>Judging from the great pile of corpses, the stand made
by Samory's Arabs must have been a dogged and
stubborn one, for traces of a most desperate battle were
everywhere apparent, yet their defeat must have been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a>[<a href="./images/118.png">118</a>]</span>
crushing and complete, for hundreds of the invaders had
apparently been mowed down where they had stood.
Others had fallen in hand-to-hand encounters, their
limbs slashed and disabled by keener swords than their
own, while many seemed literally riddled by bullets which
could never have been fired by ordinary guns, or if so,
at such close quarters that in nearly every case the balls
had passed clean through their bodies.</p>

<p>The number of corpses lying in the grass were too
numerous to count, but at a rough estimate there must
have been several thousands. The air of that beautiful
valley was suffocating on account of the stench they
emitted, and the river was poisoned by the heaps of
bodies that had been hurled into it.</p>

<p>This valley, that had appeared a veritable paradise from
the summit of the rock, was in reality a Valley of Death.</p>

<p>So nauseating was the smell that Omar decided upon
pitching the camp at a point lower down, for so exhausted
were we all and so dark was it growing that it
became imperative we should remain there for the night.
So we bivouacked half a mile away from the spot where
the Thousand Steps descended, our fire was lit, and after
a little food had been served out, we threw ourselves upon
the grass, and, worn out by fatigue, slept heavily and well.</p>

<p>The valley was filled with a thick mist that rose from
the river, overspreading everything and saturating our
scanty clothing with moisture, causing us to be chilly
and uncomfortable. It was this fact, perhaps, that
awakened me during the night, when all my companions
lying around were snoring soundly, dreaming most
probably, of their triumphant entry into the land of the
great Naya. Becoming fully awake, I heard the swish
of a footstep through the grass, and, raising my head,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a>[<a href="./images/119.png">119</a>]</span>
saw at a little distance from me Omar, standing alone.
With his back turned to me he was gazing up at the
summit of the rock we had yet to gain, bearing in his
hand a fire-brand that had apparently been lit at the
dying embers of our fire. The brand, blazing and
crackling, threw his lithe figure into relief, and I saw that
his face wore an eager, anxious look. His gaze seemed
rivetted upon the highest pinnacle of the great rock, as
if he had noticed some unusual aspect.</p>

<p>During several minutes he remained motionless, his
eyes fixed in that direction. At first I was impelled to
rise and join him, but not knowing why, I remained
there motionless watching. Presently I heard a loud cry
of joy escape his lips, and with frantic gesture he waved
the fire-brand quickly from left to right, sometimes with
a sharp motion, and at others slowly.</p>

<p>He was signalling to someone on the brow of the
precipice!</p>

<p>Open-mouthed I watched the result. The glare of
his torch prevented me from distinguishing the crest of
the rock distinctly, yet as I looked in the direction he
was gazing I presently saw far away on the summit,
glittering like a brilliant star, a bright light that seemed
in answer to Omar's signals to appear and disappear
rapidly, evidently flashing back a reply from the mysterious
realm above.</p>

<p>Suddenly the distant light became totally obscured,
and from Omar's lips there fell an expression of disappointment.
His own fire-brand was burning but dimly,
therefore, rushing to the embers, he drew another from
the fire, blew upon it violently until it flamed, and then
recommenced the puzzling signals, the system of which
seemed very similar to those used in the British Army.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a>[<a href="./images/120.png">120</a>]</span>
Again and again he repeated the long and short
waves of the flaming torch, but no answering light
appeared. All was dark upon the towering summit,
that loomed up black and lonely against the deep vault
of dark, star-lit blue. His was a weird figure, standing
in the centre of the circle of uncertain light shed by the
flambeau, watching eagerly, and waving his signals with
untiring energy.</p>

<p>"Fools!" he cried aloud to himself. "They are so
fearful of treachery that they feign not to be able to
distinguish the name of their ruler."</p>

<p>But ere the words had fallen from his lips the star-like
light again shone forth white, with intense brilliancy, but
in a different position. It seemed to have moved along
the brink of the precipice, nearer to us, and its whiteness
had been somehow intensified. In appearance it was
very similar to an electric search-light, and so powerful
were its rays that they streamed forth in a long line of
brilliancy that slowly swept the valley where the corpses
of the Arabs lay piled until it reached us, illuminating
our camp with a light almost bright as day.</p>

<p>Several minutes elapsed, and Omar, standing in the
centre of the light, casting a long grotesque shadow
behind, continued waving the word he was so desirous
of signalling. In the meantime those who were working
the light had undoubtedly ascertained the extent of our
numbers, for very soon the light slowly travelled over the
adjoining rocks, and even searched the further end of
the valley; then suddenly it shed upon us again, and
instantly became obscured.</p>

<p>Nothing daunted, Omar continued his signals until
at last they were evidently noticed and read, for suddenly
the light streamed forth again and commenced a series<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a>[<a href="./images/121.png">121</a>]</span>
of vivid flashes that lit up the valley like shafts of
lightning.</p>

<p>Thus came the answer, for next second Omar, overjoyed,
and unable to contain himself, again cried aloud:</p>

<p>"Seen! Hurrah! At last!"</p>

<p>The signals exchanged between those on the lofty
summit of the insurmountable barrier, and my friend
Omar were long, and, to me tedious. I could make
nothing of them, although it was apparent that my old
chum was carrying on an interesting conversation with
some person unseen. Once again the light swept across
the silent battle-field, showing, as if with justifiable
pride, the wholesale slaughter that had been there committed
by the defenders, and again fell full upon the
son of the dreaded Naya. Then it flashed quickly
many times and suddenly disappeared.</p>

<p>Omar seemed at last satisfied, for, holding the brand
before him, he took from the tiny bag around his neck
a pinch of the magic powder that was included in his
jujus, and pronouncing words that conveyed some mystical
meaning, slowly let the powder fall into the flickering
flame, causing it to hiss and splutter.</p>

<p>He was sacrificing to the fetish for our deliverance
from the perils of the Way of the Thousand Steps.
Even as he stood performing this pagan rite, there
sounded afar off a dull, low boom like the distant report
of heavy cannon. It echoed weirdly along the valley
where all was quiet and at rest, and was three times
repeated, like some ominous voice of warning.</p>

<p>Omar heard it. Surely the noise was an unexpected
one, for it instantly filled him with apprehension, and
he listened attentively, little dreaming that I also was
his companion upon this strange midnight vigil.</p>

<hr class="full" />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a>[<a href="./images/122.png">122</a>]</span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<h3>A SALUTE OF BULLETS.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> low booming was, however, not repeated, and by
this my companion apparently became reassured, for
shortly afterwards he threw himself down near me to
snatch a few hours' repose before dawn. I suppose I,
too, must have slept for some time, until suddenly a
noise like thunder that seemed to cause the earth to
tremble awakened me, and together with the rest of our
party I sprang to my feet, fancying that some terrible
earthquake had occurred.</p>

<p>It was still dark, and as each asked breathlessly of his
neighbour the cause of the deafening noise a sudden red
flash showed for an instant on the summit of the rock
near where I had seen the light, and a second report
thundered forth, making the valley echo and startling the
birds in thousands from their roosting-places.</p>

<p>"We are attacked!" the natives cried. "It is a gun!"</p>

<p>It was a gun undoubtedly. Again it belched forth,
its fire causing the earth to tremble, sending some small
shots unpleasantly close, and striking terror into the
hearts of our companions, who started to fly for safety,
expecting each moment that a shower of lead would
sweep upon them.</p>

<p>"Stay, cowards!" Omar cried. "Yonder gun fires not
with anger, but with joy. It is my welcome home; its
fire is but powder play!"</p>

<p>Then a loud, joyous laugh arose, and the black faces
broadened into great grins, displaying red lips and white
teeth.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a>[<a href="./images/123.png">123</a>]</span>
"Truly the land of the great Naya is a land of
wonders!" cried Kona, in astonishment. "Here they
welcome the queen's son by shooting at him. Surely
those shots a moment ago were more than powder play!"</p>

<p>"A mistake no doubt," Omar answered laughing.
"Already it is known in Mo that we are here in the
Grave of Enemies, and the guns are being fired as
welcome, while steps are being taken to convey us into
yonder land."</p>

<p>"How shall we be conveyed thither?" the headman
asked, looking up puzzled at the bare face of the rock, the
summit of which was now obscured by a bank of cloud.</p>

<p>"Wait until sun-rise. Then you will see," answered
my friend mysteriously, and as he spoke the blood-red
flash showed again and the great gun thundered forth
its salute.</p>

<p>While the dawn was spreading we ate our morning
meal with eyes fixed upon the great high crag whence
the gun belched forth with monotonous regularity; then
Omar and I strolled away together further up the valley
to occupy our time until the sun-rise. Here I saw for
the first time that natural curiosity, the honey-bird.
Omar pointed it out to me. It was a little grey
common-looking bird about the size of a thrush. It first
forced itself upon our notice by flying across our path,
uttering a shrill, unlovely cry. It then sat on a neighbouring
tree still calling and waiting for us to follow<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: added missing period">.</ins>
By short rapid flights the bird led us on and on till we
noticed that it stopped its onward course and was hanging
about among a certain half-dozen trees. These we
visited one after another and carefully examined them,
our search being rewarded by finding a nest of bees in
each of them. It is a matter of honour with the natives<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a>[<a href="./images/124.png">124</a>]</span>
to set aside a good portion of the honey for the bird.
Although this action of the honey-bird is an established
fact in natural history, it would be interesting to know
whether he ever tries to entice quadrupeds also in assisting
him in obtaining his much-loved honey.</p>

<p>As we walked back to the camp the sun suddenly
broke forth, the clouds rolled away, and on looking up
at the point where the guns had been fired we saw on the
summit a number of moving figures, looking like black
specks against the morning sky. Everyone stood watching
the far-off inhabitants of the mysterious realm, wondering
how we were to gain the high overhanging rock
that descended sheer to where we stood. Presently the
excitement reached fever-heat when we saw the small
black figures grouping themselves into a mass, and
then we noticed that one man was being slowly
lowered by a rope over the precipice. The rope was
apparently passed under his arms, and as he swung out
into mid-air his companions began to let him down
rapidly to where we stood. Owing to the overhanging
nature of the rock the wind caused the man to swing
backwards and forwards as a pendulum, and by reason
of hitches that seemed to occur in the arrangements
above he was several times stopped in his descent.</p>

<p>At last, however, his feet touched the ground and
headed by Omar, we all rushed towards him. He was a
very tall, loosely-built man, his complexion almost white
with just a yellowish tinge, colourless lips, colourless
drab hair; vague irregular features, with an entire
absence of expression. He wore an Arab haick upon
his head bound with many yards of brown camel's hair,
a long white garment, something like a burnouse, only
embroidered at the edge with crimson thread and con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a>[<a href="./images/125.png">125</a>]</span>fined
at the waist by a girdle containing quite a small
arsenal of weapons, while at his back he carried a rifle
of European manufacture, and around his neck was the
invariable string of amulets.</p>

<p>"I seek Omar, son of the Naya, the Great Queen," he
cried with a loud voice, as his feet touched the grass and
he disengaged himself from the swaying rope, which still
continued to descend.</p>

<p>"I am Omar, Prince of Mo," answered my friend,
stepping forward quickly.</p>

<p>The messenger from the mysterious realm above
regarded him keenly from head to foot, not without suspicion.
Then looking him straight in the face, he said
with a puzzled expression upon his countenance:</p>

<p>"Thou hast altered since thou hast dwelt among the
English. Thy face is not that of Omar who left many
moons ago with our Naya's trusted servant Makhana."</p>

<p>"Yet I am still Omar," he exclaimed, laughing.
"Thy caution is commendable, Babila, son of Safad, but
as the moon groweth old so does the boy turn youth, and
the youth man."</p>

<p>"Thou knowest my name, 'tis true," observed the
messenger gravely. "But where are thy royal jujus;
those placed upon thy neck by the great Naya in the
presence of the people?"</p>

<p>"I fell among enemies who burned them."</p>

<p>"The curse of Zomara be upon them," Babila said.
"Who were they?"</p>

<p>"The hirelings of our enemy, Samory."</p>

<p>"Then some have already met with their deserts, for
three thousand of them lie here in this valley," and he
pointed to the gruesome corpses scattered upon the grass.
"But hast thou no possession to assure me that thou<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a>[<a href="./images/126.png">126</a>]</span>
art actually the long-absent son of our Naya?" he
inquired.</p>

<p>"Thou carriest thy caution a little too far in this
affair, Babila," Omar answered smiling. "True, I have
lost my jujus, nevertheless I can answer thee what
questions thou puttest to me regarding my youth and my
life in Mo. I know that thou art determined to satisfy
thyself that I am actually the Prince, ere thou admittest
us to our kingdom."</p>

<p>"The caution I exercise is my duty to the great Naya
and my country," Babila answered. "No invader nor
intruder hath ever entered Mo, and none shall while I
am chief custodian of its Gate. The bones of many
adventurers lie here in this valley."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know that well," Omar answered good-humouredly.
"But what must I do to satisfy thee?"
Then turning to me, he exclaimed in English, "This is
amusing, Scars. I am actually prevented from entering
my own country because I have grown a trifle taller!"</p>

<p>"What sayest thou in a foreign tongue?" Babila inquired,
with a quick look of suspicion.</p>

<p>"I commented upon the absurdity of my situation to
my companion, Scarsmere, who has accompanied me
from England," Omar answered frankly.</p>

<p>"Scarsmere," repeated the man from the unknown
region. "Scarsmere. And is he your friend?"</p>

<p>"Yea, my best friend."</p>

<p>"If thou art actually Omar then his friend will
assuredly find welcome in Mo," the man said with
courtesy. "But answer the questions I put to thee.
Canst thou tell me anything regarding myself?"</p>

<p>"Well, I think I can," answered my friend with a
laugh. "When I was quite a young lad thou wert one of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a>[<a href="./images/127.png">127</a>]</span>
the guardians of the outer gate of our palace. Once
I was threatened by a ruffianly soldier as I passed, and
thou didst strike him dead with one blow of thy sword.
For thy prompt punishment of the fellow thou wert exalted
by the Naya and given command over her body-guard.
It was because thou didst unearth the dastardly conspiracy
against her life that thou wert given the custodianship
of the Gate of Mo."</p>

<p>"True," the man answered with a smile of satisfaction.
"In one of my age loss of memory is excusable, yet now
on looking closely at thee, I see the resemblance&mdash;yea, I
welcome thee home, my lord the prince."</p>

<p>In an instant his manner had changed, and he became
the most obedient of slaves.</p>

<p>"Very well," Omar said. "Now thou art satisfied
that I am what I said we will lose no time in passing the
last barrier."</p>

<p>"But these?" Babila inquired, glancing suspiciously at
the black rabble forming our Dagomba following.</p>

<p>"They are my escort," Omar answered. "Every
man, from Kona, the head-man, to the meanest
slave, is my trusted servant, and they all deserve reward.
Each shall enter Mo and receive it at the hands of the
Naya herself. This I have already promised."</p>

<p>"The servants of the lord prince are welcome. The
people shall <i>f&ecirc;te</i> them, and make their days pass as
quickly as seconds fly. If thou art desirous they shall
enter and be presented to the great Naya before whose
eyes all men quail," Babila said, bowing humbly before
his royal master.</p>

<p>"Then let us not pause. We desire to enter Mo
without an instant's further delay. The way has been
long and the obstacles great, but we have successfully<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a>[<a href="./images/128.png">128</a>]</span>
accomplished all, and seek now to enter the palace of my
queen-mother."</p>

<p>"Thy commands shall be obeyed," the man replied,
again salaaming, and, walking to the rope, he placed the
loops under his arm-pits, and a few minutes later was on
his way back to the mysterious land, waving his hand to
us and promising that ere an hour passed we should
enter the realm of the Great White Queen.</p>

<p>With eager upturned faces we watched the cautious
custodian of the mystic kingdom dangling at the end of
the rope, gradually leaving us, until at length he was
hauled up upon the far-off summit of the rock and disappeared
among the small crowd collected at the brow.
The men were evidently soldiers, and the eager manner
in which they grouped themselves about Babila when he
stepped into their midst, showed what intense excitement
our arrival had caused.</p>

<p>As we watched we soon afterwards saw lowered from
the towering height what appeared at first to be a thin
black cord, but which, when the end fell at our feet, we
found to be a ladder of curiously-knotted ropes about as
thick as packing twine, so flimsy in construction that it
seemed as though the weight of a single man would
break it.</p>

<p>"Are we to climb to the top?" I asked Omar, who
passed me by quickly in order to examine the ladder.</p>

<p>"Of course," he said.</p>

<p>"But surely these ropes will not bear our weight!" I
observed. "They are only like string."</p>

<p>"Yes, but the core of each is of steel wire of such
strength that it would bear our whole party all together,"
he answered. "Nevertheless, it is perhaps best to avoid
running risks, so only a dozen shall ascend at a time<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: added missing period">.</ins>"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a>[<a href="./images/129.png">129</a>]</span>
I looked up at the swaying ladder with distrust. I
had heard many stories of ropes chafing on the edges of
rocks and being cut through, and my awful experience
in descending the face of the precipice opposite had
been sufficiently terrifying.</p>

<p>"The land of the Great White Queen is, indeed, unapproachable,"
I said. "Surely no enemy could invade
you?"</p>

<p>"We fear no outside enemy," Omar answered with
sudden seriousness. "It is internal dissensions that may
cause trouble. Every precaution is taken here, at the
gate of our land, to prevent an enemy from gaining Mo.
The valley is commanded by guns in such a manner
that it can be swept from end to end, so that even if a
foe were to succeed in treading the Way of the Thousand
Steps he must descend here and remain under the fire
of the guns."</p>

<p>"I noticed that last night you signalled with a torch,"
I said.</p>

<p>"Ah! you were awake and did not speak," he laughed.
"Yes, I flashed my name, with a message to the Naya.
This was conveyed to her by a system of signals flashed
from one point to another across the country in similar
manner to those of European armies. At night the
signals are constantly at work and take the place of your
telegraphs. When the message reached the Naya she
sent me a word in return, but even then Babila was far
too cautious to afford us means to enter the country
without first inspecting us himself."</p>

<p>"You've grown a bit, and become more Anglicized
since you left," I said, smiling.</p>

<p>"Yes, possibly," he answered, adding, "I was, however,
going to explain that so elaborate are the precau<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a>[<a href="./images/130.png">130</a>]</span>tions
against invasion that even now the ladder has been
lowered, nay, even if we were at the top, the custodians
of the Gate could, by simply pressing a button, send a
current of electricity through the wires that form the
cores of the ropes of such a strength, that the ropes and
ourselves would almost instantly be fused into a shapeless
mass. See! the ropes are wet, so that the full
strength of the current could, if desired, be turned
upon us." And he pulled forward the ladder and placed
it in my hand.</p>

<p>Instinctively I shrank away, saying:</p>

<p>"I have no desire to be electrocuted just yet."</p>

<p>"Well, it's merely one of the many devices we have
here for the warm reception of any enemy," he answered.
"The number of bodies yonder are sufficient proof that
any expedition against us must be ill-fated."</p>

<p>But just at that moment a rapid signal was flashed by
the sun's rays upon a mirror, and reading it, he exclaimed
in English:</p>

<p>"All is fast above. Come, Scars, old chap, follow
me and let me hear your opinion of my country. Keep
your chin raised and don't look down, or you may turn
giddy."</p>

<p>Then, giving directions to Kona to allow only twelve
men to swarm the flimsy ladder at one time, he placed
his foot upon the first rung and commenced the long
straight ascent.</p>

<p>As soon as he had climbed a dozen feet I glanced up
at the towering crag, then followed his example.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

<h3>THE MYSTERIOUS REALM.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">So</span> unsteady was the ladder, straining and springing at
every step I took, that I was compelled to grip its wet
cords with all the strength of which I was capable. It
swayed to and fro fearfully, and more than once I
dreaded that I should lose my hold and fall backwards
to earth.</p>

<p>Omar above me, lithe and active as a cat, climbed on,
chaffing me for my tardy progress, and now and then
halting and mischievously shaking the ladder to increase
my fear. The higher I ascended the more strongly
blew the wind, until it whistled in the thin ropes and
blew through my scanty clothing, chilling my bones.
My hands and feet were bruised and sore from
the previous day's descent, nevertheless I thought not
of pain, only of peril. The climb was long and tedious.
Even Omar, who had commenced by running up like a
squirrel in his eagerness to gain the land from which he
had so long been absent, was soon compelled to pause
and steady himself, or he would assuredly have been
jerked from his insecure position.</p>

<p>The ten men plodding up after us seemed to be
keeping step, causing the ladder to spring fearfully each
time they ascended the next rung. Omar, himself fearing
disaster, at last called to them, but jabbering among
themselves in the highest spirits, each eager to set foot
in the land of mystery, they took no heed of their guide's
instructions.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a>[<a href="./images/132.png">132</a>]</span>
"You fools!" he cried angrily. "Climb slowly and
with care. Don't jump so. We're not on a spring-board."</p>

<p>Useless. We still went up and down like a ball at the
end of a piece of elastic.</p>

<p>"Do you hear?" he shrieked in the Dagomba
tongue, halting and looking down at the string of
grinning blacks. "Halt!"</p>

<p>This sudden stoppage attracted their attention, and in
mid-air he soundly rated them for their folly, instructing
them how to ascend, and declaring that if they continued
their hilarious progress a fearful disaster must ensue.
These words immediately had the desired effect, for
which I confess I was very thankful, as I had feared
every moment that we should be dashed into the valley,
and now as we went forward again the ladder was much
steadier.</p>

<p>From far below we could hear the distant shouts
of Kona and our excited companions encouraging us
and urging us on, for they were all impatience to follow
us. Now and then the great grey vultures, having gorged
themselves to their full upon the corpses in the valley,
circled around us as if ready to tear us from our perilous
position, and more than once I saw Omar raise his arm
to beat them off. We were, I suppose, passing near
their nests and thus aroused their ire.</p>

<p>Looking up, I saw that we were slowly approaching
the beetling portion of the enormous rock, but had yet
a long distance to climb. Steadily, however, we all
ascended, each grasping the wet slippery cords tightly to
prevent being blown off by the high gusty wind, and
even when we gained the jutting rock believing we had
attained the summit, we found ourselves still fully two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a>[<a href="./images/133.png">133</a>]</span>
hundred feet from where Babila could be seen peering
over awaiting us.</p>

<p>The ladder laying upon the face of the cliff at this
point was much easier of ascent, for the weight of the
portion below me prevented it from swaying, and by
scrambling up with increased haste I soon found myself
immediately behind Omar.</p>

<p>Then continuing steadily, now and then being compelled
to bend backwards in a most perilous position
in order to negotiate a projecting piece of rock, we
together climbed up to the edge of the fearful precipice,
each being lent a willing hand by Babila as we
swarmed upon our knees to where he stood.</p>

<p>"Welcome, O Prince," the old man exclaimed,
salaaming when Omar stood before him. "Welcome to
thy white friend from beyond the great black water."</p>

<p>In an instant from a thousand throats rose cries of
adulation, and looking around I saw that drawn up
before us was a great concourse of fighting-men. Some
were mounted on magnificent chargers, others were on
foot, and among them were many silken banners each
bearing the same device, a black vampire bat with wings
outspread upon a crimson ground. Each soldier was
similarly attired to Babila, with white embroidered robe and
girdle, and each carried a rifle and a long curved sword.</p>

<p>Babila was evidently a great man in the estimation of
all others, for whatever he did the soldiers imitated.
In appearance they had the advantage of all coloured
and most white races. As a rule they seemed very tall,
well set up, with well-formed limbs covered with an almost
white skin, the texture of which would excite envy in
the heart of many a European beauty. The features
had nothing in common with the coarse negro type<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a>[<a href="./images/134.png">134</a>]</span>
which prevailed in the forest and over the grass-lands,
but rather inclined towards a Semitic type. Thick lips
were the exception, not the rule, and a broad flat nose
was also a rarity. The only sign of barbarity was in the
hair which, when the head was not clean shaven, was
allowed to grow straight out in every direction, giving a
very wild appearance to its owner. The hair of some,
however, seemed to be softer, for it hung down to the
nape of the neck in long, closely-curled ringlets. The
women, a few of whom were watching us curiously, were
all comely, and, attired in long white robes of a more
elaborate pattern than the men, had their hair enclosed
in a dark blue fillet, a difference in the disposition of the
latter distinguishing between a married and an unmarried
woman.</p>

<p>A great tent of yellow silk had been erected near,
presumably for our accommodation. Over it waved the
hideous-looking vampire bat, and as led by Babila with
frequent prostrations we entered it, I asked Omar the
meaning of the sable device.</p>

<p>"It is the royal mark of the Sanoms, the same as the
lion and the unicorn is the crest of your great Queen.
The black vampire is the guardian fetish of our throne."</p>

<p>On entering, Omar walked to a raised da&iuml;s whereon
two stools were placed, and taking one invited me to
the other. Then, while awaiting the arrival of our companions,
food was brought to us, and we ate and drank
to our full, Babila himself attending to our wants personally.
Neither were our companions forgotten, for
they were arranged around the tent, and squatting upon
their haunches ate and jabbered to their hearts' content.</p>

<p>It was highly amusing to watch the interest with which
the natives regarded the stolid soldiers of Mo, who stood<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a>[<a href="./images/135.png">135</a>]</span>
in long lines, motionless as statues. They went close
up to them, examined them from head to foot, drew the
sword from its sheath, handled it and tried its edge with
a grunt of satisfaction. Then they would replace it,
finger the accoutrements, examine carefully what they
thought might be gold, and at last, folding their arms,
would stand silent, awe-stricken at the whole effect of
the unknown race.</p>

<p>The denizens of this mysterious country, however,
seemed to regard our natives with supercilious disdain.
Probably their contempt had been engendered by the
fact that certain tribes had on several occasions
attempted an invasion, and they had from their formidable
heights simply swept them out of existence
as easily as a fly may be crushed with the finger. When
looking at the handsome women, the enormous mouths
of the Dagombas would widen into broad grins which,
intended to convey an expression of delight, in reality
rendered them hideous.</p>

<p>For three hours we remained in the tent, sheltered
from the sun's glaring heat, while parties of a dozen of
our followers continued to arrive. It was Omar's intention
to enter the capital with the whole of our faithful
band, otherwise he would have started immediately we
had gained the summit. Babila urged him to do so, but
he expressed a desire that Kona and his heroic blacks
should accompany us.</p>

<p>At last the whole of the party had gained the top of
the rock and had refreshed themselves after their toil and
peril; the rope ladder with its hidden electric wires had
been hauled up, and, headed by men blowing loud blasts
upon great horns of ivory and gold, we all moved forward,
a most imposing and magnificent cavalcade.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a>[<a href="./images/136.png">136</a>]</span>
Both Omar and myself had been mounted on fine
milk-white horses with gay trappings of silver and royal
blue, while behind us came Kona with a very unsteady
seat upon a long raw-boned stallion. He was evidently
not used to horses, and the way he clutched at the mane
each time his animal trotted convulsed both his men
and the soldiers in the vicinity with laughter.</p>

<p>A shady march of two days in a north-westerly direction
up the bank of a babbling stream brought us to
higher land. The journey was uneventful, the country
being devoid of both game and people. We saw old
traces of habitation, it is true, but the people seemed to
have been driven away or killed, leaving only the empty
stone-built houses. From the hill on the side of which
we pitched our camp a marvellous view was obtainable.
To the north a black forest extended as far as the eye
could reach, broken only by three small hills that served
as landmarks. To the west rolled some giant snow-capped
mountains, while the range whereon we stood
was a low, stone-covered stretch of round-topped hills,
flanked by thick mimosa jungle and filled with
rhinoceros. Wherever we went, we found traces of
them, their feeding ground being apparently restricted
to a very small area. Never having been hunted, they
probably found no reason to leave such excellent
pasture, and it was little wonder that Kona and his
men were anxious to remain behind and commit havoc
amongst them.</p>

<p>On the third day we encamped near a most extraordinary
place. It was a small valley about thirty-five
feet below the surrounding ground, looking like the dry
bed of a stream, and was about a mile in circumference.</p>

<p>"Come, I want to show you Zomara's Wrath," Omar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a>[<a href="./images/137.png">137</a>]</span>
said, and dismounting we went together towards it, notwithstanding
the loud cries of warning that arose on
every side. A dog&mdash;a lean, hungry, strange-looking
brute, who accompanied the troops&mdash;bounded after us,
and as we approached the place I noticed a suffocating
smell, and was attacked by nausea and giddiness. A
belt of this f&oelig;tid atmosphere surrounded the valley.
We, however, passed through it, and in purer air, with
hands still over my nose and mouth, was permitted to
view the awful spectacle&mdash;for it was awful.</p>

<p>The entire bed of the valley seemed like one solid
rock, but scattered over the barren floor were skeletons
of men, wild hogs, deer, rhinoceros, lions, and all kinds
of birds and smaller animals. I could discover no hole
or crevice in any place whence the poisonous fumes
were emitted. I was anxious to reach the bottom of the
valley, if possible, but my suggestion was at once
negatived by my companion, who said:</p>

<p>"To go further is certain death. Come, let us return
quickly, or we may be overpowered. This is one of the
natural wonders of our land."</p>

<p>I determined, however, to see what the fumes smelled
like, and, greatly to Omar's horror, started to descend.
The dog was with me, and as soon as he saw me step
over the side of the bank he rushed down ahead of me.</p>

<p>I endeavoured to call him back, but too late. As
soon as the animal reached the rocky bed below he fell
upon his side.</p>

<p>He continued to breathe a few moments only, then
expired.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX"></a>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>

<h3>THE CITY IN THE CLOUDS.</h3>


<p>"<span class="smcap">There</span> is a strange story connected with this place
known to us as Zomara's Wrath," Omar said, when together
we turned away and mounted our horses to ride
back to the camp.</p>

<p>"Relate it to me," I urged eagerly.</p>

<p>"To-night. After we have eaten at sundown I will
tell you about it," he answered, and spurring our horses
we galloped quickly forward.</p>

<p>When we had eaten that evening and were seated
aside together, I reminded him of his promise.</p>

<p>"It is a story of my ancestors, and it occurred more
than a thousand years ago," he said. "Ruler of the
great kingdom of Mo, King Lobenba had no children.
The three queens observed fasts, kept vows, made
offerings to the fetish, all to no effect. By a lucky
chance a great hermit made his appearance in our
capital. The King and queens received the visitor at the
palace, and treated him with the most generous and
sincere hospitality. The guest was very pleased; by a
prompting of the fetish he knew what they wanted, and
gave them three peppercorns, one for each queen. In
due time three sons were born, Karmos, Matrugna,
and Fausalya, who when they reached a suitable age
married by the ceremony of 'choice,' daughters of a
branch of the royal family. When the brides arrived at
their husbands' family and were disciplined in their wifely
duties, King Lobenba, who was growing old, thought the
time had arrived for him to make over the royal burden<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a>[<a href="./images/139.png">139</a>]</span>
to younger shoulders, and to adopt a hermit's life preliminary
to death. So in consultation with the royal
fetish-man, a day was appointed for the coronation of
Prince Karmos, who had married a beautiful girl named
Naya. But the fates had willed it otherwise. Long
before the children were born, when King Lobenba, in
his younger days, was subduing a revolt in this region
where we now are he once fell from his chariot while
aiming an arrow, and got his arm crushed under the
wheel. The three queens had accompanied their royal
husband to the battlefield to soften for him the hardships
of his camp life, and during the long illness that followed
the wound, Queen Zulnam, who afterwards became
mother of Fausalya, nursed him with all the devotion of
a wife's first young love. 'Ask me anything and thou
shalt have it,' said the monarch during his convalescence.
'I have to ask only two favours, my lord,' she answered.
'I grant them beforehand. Name them,' he cried. But
she said she wished for nothing at that time, but would
make her request in due course. She waited twenty
years. Then she repaired to her husband on the morning
of Karmos' coronation and boldly requested that the
prince should absent himself for fourteen years, and that
her son Fausalya should be crowned instead."</p>

<p>"She was artful," I observed, laughing.</p>

<p>"Yes," he went on. "The words fell like a thunder-bolt
upon the king, the light faded from his eyes and he
fainted. Nevertheless, Zulnam's wish was granted, and
Karmos' departure was heartrending. To soften the
austerities of forest life, Prince Matrugna tore himself
from his newly-married bride to accompany Karmos.
But the hardest was to be the latter's wrench from his
devoted Naya. The change from a most exuberant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a>[<a href="./images/140.png">140</a>]</span>
girlish gaiety to quivering grief, and the offer of the
delicately-nurtured wife to share with her lord the
severities of an exile's life are often told by every wise
man in Mo. Fourteen long years Karmos spent in exile
with his beautiful wife as companion, until at last they
were free to return. The home-coming was one long
triumph. The people were mad with delight to welcome
their hero Karmos and their beloved Naya. Karmos
was crowned, and then began that government whose
morality and justice and love and purity have passed
into the proverbs of my race. There was, however, one
blemish upon it. Poor Naya's evil genius had not yet
exhausted his malevolence. A rumour was spread by
evil tongues that she was plotting to possess the crown,
and Karmos, sacrificing the husband's love, the father's
joy, to his kingly duty, while standing on that spot we
have visited to-day&mdash;then his summer palace surrounded
by lovely gardens&mdash;pronounced sentence of exile upon
her. But in an instant, swift as the lightning from
above, the terrible curse of Zomara fell upon him,
striking him dead, his magnificent palace was swept
away and swallowed up by a mighty earthquake, and
from the barren hole, once the fairest spot in the land,
there have ever since belched forth fumes that poison
every living thing. It is Zomara's Wrath."</p>

<p>"And what became of Naya, the queen?" I asked,
struck with the remarkable story that seemed more than
a mere legend.</p>

<p>"She reigned in his stead," he answered. "Whenever
we speak of the Nayas we sum up all that is noble and
mighty and queenly in government, its tact, its talent,
its love and its beneficence, for every queen who has
since sat on the Great Emerald Throne of Mo has been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a>[<a href="./images/141.png">141</a>]</span>
named after her, and I am her lineal descendant, the last
of her line."</p>

<p>That night we rested on soft cushions spread for us in
our tent, and marching again early next morning, spent
the two following days in crossing a great swamp, which,
rather than a miasmatic death-hole, was a naturalist's
paradise. As our horses trod the soft, spongy ground,
a majestic canopy of stately cypress, mangrove and maple
trees protected us from the burning sun, and the sweet-scented
flowers of the magnolias, azaleas and wild grapes
added fragrance and beauty to the scene. Flies, snakes
and frogs were very numerous, but gave us little trouble,
nevertheless, I was not sorry when at dawn on the third
day after passing the strange natural phenomenon we saw
across the level pasture-like plain, high up, spectral and
half hidden in the grey haze, the gigantic walls and high
embattlements of the mysterious city.</p>

<p>"Lo!" cried Omar, who was riding at my side. "See!
At last we are within sight of the goal towards which we
have so long striven. Yonder is Mo, sometimes called
the City in the Clouds!"</p>

<p>"But for your courage we must have failed long ago,"
I observed, my eyes turned to where the horizon closed
the long perspective of the sky. Away there was the
sweetest light. Elsewhere colour marred the simplicity
of light; but there colour was effaced, not as men efface
it, by a blur or darkness, but by mere light. And against
it rose, high and faintly outlined, the defences of the
great unknown city standing on the summit of what
appeared to be a gigantic rock. "Magnificent!" I
exclaimed, entranced by the view. "Superb!"</p>

<p>"It is, as you see, built high upon the rock known as
the Throne of the Naya," Omar explained. "Although<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a>[<a href="./images/142.png">142</a>]</span>
founded a thousand years ago by the good queen about
whom I told you, no stranger has ever yet set foot within
its gates. From time to time our monarchs have sent
their trusty agents among civilized nations, gathered from
them their inventions, and introduced to us the results
of their progress. Isolated as we are from the world, we
are nevertheless enlightened, as you will shortly see."</p>

<p>I was prompted to make some observation regarding
his paganism, but held my peace, knowing that any
reference to it wounded his susceptibilities. In everything
except his belief in the fetish and his trust in the
justice of the Crocodile-god, he was my equal; and I
knew that, on more than one occasion, he had been
ashamed to practise his savage rites in my presence.
Therefore I hesitated, and, as we rode along, the outline
of the great city, perched high upon the rock, growing
every moment more formidable and distinct, I listened
to the many interesting facts he related.</p>

<p>Kona, who followed us, listened with strained ears,
and our Dagombas were one and all laughing and keeping
up a Babel-like chatter that showed the intense
excitement caused among them by the sight of the mysterious
capital of the Great White Queen.</p>

<p>We had struck a broad well-made road, and now, as
with hastening steps we approached it, we could distinguish
quite plainly the inaccessible character of the
high rock that rose abruptly a thousand feet above the
plain crowned by the frowning walls of immense thickness
that enclosed the place. Beyond, rose many lofty
towers and several gilded domes which, Omar told me,
were the audience-halls of the great palace, and immediately
before us we could see in the walls, flanked on
either side by great strong watch-towers, a closed gate.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a>[<a href="./images/143.png">143</a>]</span>
From where we stood we could distinguish no means
of approach to the impregnable fortress, but on coming
at last to the base of the rock we found a long flight of
narrow steps mounting zig-zag up its dark, moss-grown
face. When the cavalcade halted before them our
trumpeters blew thrice shrill blasts upon their big ivory
horns, and like magic the ponderous iron gate far above
instantly swung open, and the walls literally swarmed
with men, whose bright arms glittered in the sun.
Above, where all had been silent a moment before,
everything was now bustle and excitement as Babila
sprang from his horse and commenced to mount the long
flight of steps, followed by myself and my companion.</p>

<p>So steep were these stairs cut in the rock that an iron
chain had been placed beside them by which to steady
one's-self.</p>

<p>"Are there again a thousand steps?" I asked Omar.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said. "Naya, wife of Karmos, had them
cut under her personal supervision. There are exactly
a thousand&mdash;the number of generations which, she declared,
should flourish and die ere Mo be conquered."</p>

<p>Then without further words we eagerly continued our
upward climb to the mystic City in the Clouds.</p>



<hr class="full" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX"></a>CHAPTER XX.</h2>

<h3>THE GREAT WHITE QUEEN.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Gaining</span> the summit and entering the ponderous gate
closely behind old Babila, I was amazed at the bewildering
aspect of the gigantic city. As Omar placed his
foot upon the top step, great drums, ornamented by
golden bats with outspread wings, were thumped by a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a>[<a href="./images/144.png">144</a>]</span>
perspiring line of drummers, horns were blown with ear-piercing
vehemence, and the huge guns mounted on the
walls thundered forth a deafening salute.</p>

<p>Then, as we walked forward along the way kept clear
for us through the enormous crowd of curious citizens,
Babila at last met the tall, patriarchal-looking man in
command of the city-gate.</p>

<p>"Lo!" he cried. "With our Prince Omar there
returneth a retinue of strangers. This one," indicating
myself, "is from the land of the white men that lieth
beyond the great black water. The others are from the
borders of Prempeh's kingdom."</p>

<p>"Art thou certain there are no spies among them?"
asked the man, glancing at me keenly in suspicion.</p>

<p>"I, Omar, Prince of Mo, vouch for each man's
honesty," exclaimed my friend, interrupting. At these
words the chief guardian of the gate bowed until his
long white beard swept the ground, and we passed on,
followed by Kona and our black companions, in whom
the denizens of the mysterious place seemed highly
interested, never before having seen negro savages.</p>

<p>Now and then as we passed along voices raised in
dissension that strangers should be admitted to the inaccessible
kingdom reached our ears, but these were
drowned by the wild plaudits of the crowd. On every
hand Omar was greeted with an enthusiasm befitting the
heir to the Emerald Throne, and he, in response, bowed
his head from side to side, as with royal gait he strode
down the broad handsome thoroughfare. The buildings
on either hand were magnificent in their proportions,
built of enormous blocks of grey stone finely sculptured,
with square ornamented windows. Apparently the
manufacture of glass was unknown, for all the windows<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a>[<a href="./images/145.png">145</a>]</span>
were uniformly latticed. Here and there through the
open doors we caught sight of cool courtyards, with
trees and plashing fountains beyond, while from the flat
roofs that here seemed to be the principal promenade
of the ladies, as in Eastern lands, white hands and bejewelled
arms waved us dainty welcome.</p>

<p>Across a great market square, where slaves were being
bought and sold, and business was proceeding uninterruptedly,
we passed, and as we glanced at the unfortunate
ones huddled up in the scanty shadow, we remembered
the day when we, too, had been sold by our bitter
and well-hated enemy, Samory. I smiled as I reflected
what terrible revenge this great army of the Naya could
wreak upon the Arab chief, and found myself anticipating
the day when the soldiery of Mo should gather
before the old villain's stronghold.</p>

<p>Kona, who had come up beside me, walked on in
silent amazement. He knew nothing of civilization, and
the sights he now witnessed held him dumb. The
African mind is slow to understand the benefits of civilization
and modern progress, unless it be the substitution
of guns for bows and bullets for arrows. At last we
turned a corner suddenly, and saw before us, rising against
the intensely blue sky and flashing in the brilliant sunlight,
the three great gilded domes of the royal palace.</p>

<p>"Gold!" cried Kona, in an awed tone. "See!"
and he turned to several of his sable brethren. "See!
they build their great huts of solid gold! What treasure
they must have!"</p>

<p>As we advanced in imposing procession, the great gate
of this royal residence, grim and frowning as a fortress,
over which a large flag was floating, bearing the sign of
the vampire bat, opened wide, and, unchallenged by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a>[<a href="./images/146.png">146</a>]</span>
crowds of gaily-dressed soldiers drawn up in line and
saluting, we went forward amid vociferous cheering.</p>

<p>Ours was indeed a progress full of triumph and enthusiasm.
The heir to the throne, long since mourned
for as lost, had returned, and the loyal people were filled
with great rejoicing. Through one spacious courtyard
after another we passed, always between long lines of
stalwart men-at-arms, bearing good English rifles and
well-made accoutrements, until, ascending a short flight
of wide steps of polished black stone, we found ourselves
in a great hall beneath one of the gilded domes that
had so impressed our head-man. Before us was a huge
curtain of purple velvet that screened from view the
further end of the hall, but when all had assembled
and stood grouped together, this drapery was suddenly
lifted, disclosing to our gaze a sight that filled us with
greatest wonder and amazement.</p>

<p>The central object was the historic Emerald Throne,
a wonderful golden seat so thickly encrusted with
beautiful green gems as to appear entirely constructed of
them. Some of the stones were of enormous size,
beautifully cut, of amazing brilliance and fabulous value.
Above, was suspended a golden representation of a
crocodile&mdash;the god Zomara. Lolling lazily among the
pink silk cushions was a woman, tall, thin-faced and
ascetic, with a complexion white as my own, high cheek
bones, small black, brilliant eyes, and hair plentifully
tinged with grey. Her personality was altogether a
striking one, for her brow was low, her face hawk-like,
and her long, bony hands resting on the arms of the
seat of royalty seemed like the talons of the bird to
which her face bore resemblance.</p>

<p>It was the Naya, the dreaded Great White Queen!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a>[<a href="./images/147.png">147</a>]</span>
Her robes of rich brocaded silk were of a brilliant
golden yellow, heavily embroidered with gold thread,
and thickly studded with various jewels. In the bright
flood of sunlight that struck full upon her from the
painted dome above, the diamonds and rubies enriching
her handsome corsage gleamed and flashed white, green
and blood-red. Indeed, so covered was her breast by
the fiery gems that as it heaved and fell their flashing
dazzled us; yet in her eyes was a cruel, crafty gleam that
from the first moment I saw her roused instinctively
within me fear and suspicion.</p>

<p>No smile of welcome crossed her cold, implacable
features as her gaze met that of her son Omar; no
enthusiastic or maternal greeting passed her lips. Her
maids of honour and courtiers grouped about her murmured
approbation and welcome as the heavy curtains
fell aside, but frowning slightly she raised her bejewelled
claw-like hand impatiently with a gesture commanding
silence, darting hasty glances of displeasure upon those
who had, by applauding, lowered her regal dignity. On
either side black female slaves in garments of crimson
silk and wearing golden girdles, massive earrings and
neck chains, slowly fanned the ruler of Mo with large
circular fans of ostrich feathers, and from a pedestal
near her a tiny fountain of some fragrant perfume shot
up and fell with faint plashing into its basin of marvellously-cut
crystal. The splendour was barbaric yet
refined, illustrative everywhere of the tastes of these
denizens of the unknown kingdom. The walls of the
great hall were strangely sculptured with colossal monstrosities,
mostly hideous designs, apparently intended
to depict the awful wrath of the deity Zomara, while
here and there were curious frescoes of almost photo<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a>[<a href="./images/148.png">148</a>]</span>graphic
finish, the execution of which had been accomplished
by some art quite unknown to European civilization.
The paving whereon we stood was of jasper,
highly polished, with here and there strange outlines
inlaid with gold. These outlines, a little crude and
unfinished, were mostly illustrative of the power of the
Nayas, depicting scenes of battle, justice and execution.</p>

<p>"Let our son Omar stand forth and approach our
Emerald Throne," exclaimed the Naya at last, in a thin,
rasping voice, moving slightly as she bent forward, fixing
her shining eyes upon us. They glittered with evil.</p>

<p>At the royal command all bowed low in submission,
it being etiquette to do this whenever the Naya
expressed command or wish, and Omar, leaving my side,
strode forward with becoming hauteur, and, crossing the
floor as highly polished as glass, advanced to his royal
mother, and, bending upon his knee, pressed her thin,
bony hand to his lips.</p>

<p>But even then no expression of pleasure crossed her
stony features. I had expected to witness an affectionate
meeting between mother and son, and was extremely
surprised at the coldness of my friend's reception,
having regard to his long absence and the many perils
we had together faced on our entry into Mo.</p>

<p>"News was flashed unto me last night that thou hadst
crossed the Thousand Steps," the Queen said, slowly
withdrawing her bony hand. "Why hast thou returned
from the land of the white men, and why, pray, hast
thou brought hither strangers with thee?"</p>

<p>"These strangers are heroes, each one of them,"
Omar answered, rising, and standing before the throne.
"Every man has already fought for thee, and for Mo."</p>

<p>"For me? How?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a>[<a href="./images/149.png">149</a>]</span>
Then briefly he related how we had met the remnant
of Samory's invading force and defeated them, so that
not a single fugitive remained.</p>

<p>"These savages fought merely for their own lives, not
for me," she said with a supercilious sneer, regarding
the half-clad natives with disdain. "We in Mo desire
not the introduction of such creatures as these."</p>

<p>"Are not my friends welcome?" Omar asked, pale
with anger. "A Sanom hath never yet turned from his
palace those who have proved themselves his friends."</p>

<p>"Neither hath a Sanom sought the aid of savages,"
answered the Great White Queen, with a glance of
withering scorn.</p>

<p>"Adversity sometimes causeth us to seek strange
alliances," my friend argued. "These men of the
Dagomba, Kona, their head man, and Scarsmere, my
friend from the land of the white men, have given me
aid, and if thou accordest them no welcome, then I,
Omar, in the name of my ancestors, the Nabas and the
Nayas, will give them greeting, and provide them with
befitting entertainment while they are within our walls."</p>

<p>His words caused instant consternation. The will of
the Naya was not to be thwarted. Her every wish was
law; a single word from her meant life or death. This
openly-expressed opposition was, to the court, a most
terrible offence, punishable by death to all others save the
heir.</p>

<p>The Naya, her thin lips tightly set and cruelty lurking
in the corners of her mouth, rose slowly with an air of
terrible anger.</p>

<p>"Does our son Omar thus defy us?" she asked with
grim harshness.</p>

<p>"I defy thee not O queen-mother," answered my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a>[<a href="./images/150.png">150</a>]</span>
friend, clasping his hands resolutely behind his back,
and standing with his legs slightly apart. "I bring
unto thee those who have fought for me, and have been
my companions through many perils, expecting welcome.
Were it not for them I, the last of our regal line, would
be no longer living, and at thy death our kingdom would
have been without a ruler."</p>

<p>"Son, the claim of these, thy friends, to my protection
is admitted; nevertheless, the stranger, whoever he may
be, is by the law of our kingdom that hath been rigorously
observed for a thousand years, debarred from
traversing the Thousand Steps."</p>

<p>As the queen spoke I noticed two gorgeously-attired
men behind her, probably her chief advisers, exchange
whispers with smiles of evident satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Then I am to understand that the Naya of Mo
absolutely refuseth to sanction these my friends to dwell
within our walls?" Omar said.</p>

<p>"We forbid these strangers to remain," answered the
Queen, crimsoning with anger that her son should have
thus argued with her. "They are granted until noon to-morrow
to quit our city. Those found within our land
after three suns have set will be held as slaves. I, the
Naya, have spoken."</p>

<p>"As thou willest it, so it will be," answered her son,
bowing very stiffly. Then, turning to us, he said:</p>

<p>"Friends, the people give you cordial welcome, even
though the Naya may refuse to grant you peace. You
shall remain&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thou insultest us publicly," cried the Great White
Queen, still standing erect, her black eyes flashing
beneath the wisp of scanty grey hair, and her talon-like
hand uplifted. "To utter such words hast thou<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a>[<a href="./images/151.png">151</a>]</span>
returned from the land beyond the black seas? True,
thou art my son, and some day will sit upon this my
stool, but for thus opposing my will thou shalt be
banished from Mo until such time as I am carried to the
tombs of my fathers. Then, when thou returnest hither,
thy reign shall be one of tumults and evil-doing. The
people who now shout themselves hoarse because their
idol Omar hath returned to them, shall, in that day,
curse thee, and heap upon thee every indignity. May
the Great Darkness encompass thee, may thine enemies
break and crush thee, and may Zomara, the One of
Power, smite and devour thee," and as she uttered these
words she held up her long skinny arms to the hideous
golden crocodile suspended over her, muttering some
mystic sentences the while.</p>

<p>Her slaves and courtiers held their breath. The
Great White Queen was cursing her only son. The
Dagombas understood this action and stood aghast,
while across the faces of the court dignitaries a few
moments later there flitted faint sickly smiles. The
scene was impressive, more so perhaps than any I had
before witnessed. In her sudden ebullition of anger the
Naya was indeed terrible.</p>

<p>From her thin blue lips curses most fearful rolled
until even her courtiers shuddered. As she stood, her
bony arms uplifted to the image of what was to her the
greatest and most dreaded power on earth, she screamed
herself hoarse, uttering imprecations until about her
mouth there hung a blood-flecked foam, and her long
finger-nails were driven deep into the flesh of her
withered palms. All quaked visibly at her wrath, for
none knew who might next offend her and pay the
penalty for so doing with their lives: none knew who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a>[<a href="./images/152.png">152</a>]</span>
might next fall victim to her insane passion for causing
suffering to others.</p>

<p>Omar alone stood calmly watching her; all others remained
terrified, fearing to utter a single word.</p>

<p>Suddenly, in her mad passion, she shrieked:</p>

<p>"Gankoma! Gankoma! Come hither. There is
still work for thee."</p>

<p>In an instant the chief executioner, a man of giant
stature, gaudily attired and bearing a huge curved sword
that gleamed ominously in the sunlight, stood before
her, and bowing, answered:</p>

<p>"Your majesty is obeyed."</p>

<p>"There is one who hath betrayed his trust," cried the
angry ruler. "To Babila, guardian of the Gate, we owe
this intrusion of strangers in our land and these insults
from the mouth of one who is unworthy to be called
son. Bring forth Babila."</p>

<p>The executioner, sword in hand, advanced to where
the trusty old custodian stood. At mention of his name
a despairing cry had escaped him. He knew, alas! his
fate was sealed.</p>

<p>Pale, trembling in the iron grip of the executioner, he
was hurried forward before the dazzling Emerald Throne.</p>

<p>"See! he flinches, the perfidious old traitor!" the
Naya cried. "His duty was to prevent any stranger from
entering Mo, yet he actually assisted yonder horde of
savages to gain access to our innermost courts. He&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mercy, your majesty! mercy!" implored the unhappy
man, falling prone at her feet. "I have guarded
the Gate with my life always. I believed that thy son's
friends were thine also."</p>

<p>"Silence!" shrieked the Naya. "Let not his voice
again fall upon our ears. Let him die now, before our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a>[<a href="./images/153.png">153</a>]</span>
eyes, and let his carcase be given as offal to the dogs.
Let one hundred of his guards die also. Others who
would thwart us will thus be warned."</p>

<p>"Mercy!" screamed the wretched old fellow hoarsely,
clasping his hands in fervent supplication.</p>

<p>"Gankoma, I have spoken," cried the Great White
Queen, majestically waving her hand.</p>

<p>Babila, inactive by age, struggled to regain his feet,
but ere he could do so, or before Omar could interfere,
the executioner had lifted his sword with both hands.
The sound of a dull blow was heard, and next second
the head of the Queen's faithful servant rolled across the
polished floor, while from the decapitated trunk the blood
gushed forth and ran in an ugly serpentine stream over
the jasper slabs.</p>

<p>A sudden thrill of horror ran through the crowd at
this summary execution of one who had hitherto been
implicitly trusted, but only for an instant was the ghastly
body allowed to remain before the eyes of Queen
and court, for half a dozen slaves had been standing in
readiness with bowls of water, and some of these rushing
forward carried away the head and body and flung it to
the dogs, while others swiftly removed all traces of the
gruesome spectacle.</p>

<p>Little wonder therefore that the great Naya should be
held in awe by all her subjects, for in her anger she
seemed capable of the most fiendish cruelty. As in
Kumassi, so also in Mo, death seemed to come quickly,
and for any paltry offence. Gankoma, executioner to the
Great White Queen, was, I afterwards learnt, continually
busy obeying the royal commands, and the rapidly
increasing number of victims whose heads fell beneath
his terrible knife was causing most serious discontent.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI"></a>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>

<h3>A FIGURE IN THE SHADOW.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">An</span> hour after sundown I was seated with Omar and
Kona on a mat in the courtyard of a house not far
from the gates of the palace, where hospitality had been
secretly offered us. We were discussing the situation.
Our black followers, on leaving the presence of the irate
queen, had gone out in small groups to wander through
the wonderful city, having arranged to meet again at
midnight.</p>

<p>The man in whose house we had found shelter was
named Goliba, a staunch friend of Omar's, although one
of the royal councillors. As we sat together this old
man with long flowing white beard, keen aquiline
features and black eyes that age had not dimmed,
explained facts that amazed us. He told us that Kouaga,
a favourite of the Naya, had been approached secretly
by her as to the advisability of Omar's assassination.
The old councillor had actually overheard this dastardly
plot formed by the queen against her son, for she
feared that owing to the harshness of her rule popular
opinion might be diverted in his favour, and that she
might be overthrown, and he set upon the Emerald
Throne in her stead. The Naya had regretted sending
Omar away for safety, so giving Kouaga a large sum of
money, she ordered him to proceed to England and
assassinate the heir. He left, and apparently on his
way conceived the idea that he might, with considerable
advantage, play a double game. Samory, whose secret
agent in Mo he was, intended, he knew, to lead a great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a>[<a href="./images/155.png">155</a>]</span>
expedition against the unapproachable country, its principal
object being to secure the vast treasures known to
be concealed within the City in the Clouds. As Omar
alone knew its secret hiding-place it occurred to Kouaga
to convey him to the stronghold of the Mohammedan
chief before assassinating him, and obtain from him the
whereabouts of the great collection of gold and gems.
The Naya had ordered that her son should be killed
secretly in England, but this cowardly crime was averted
by Kouaga's cupidity, and we had therefore been enticed
to the Arab sheikh's headquarters. The object of both
men being thwarted by Omar's refusal to divulge the
secret, we had been sold into slavery and consigned as
human sacrifices before King Prempeh.</p>

<p>"We'll be even yet with that scoundrel and traitor,
Kouaga," Omar said, turning to me when Goliba had
finished.</p>

<p>"If the command be given every man in Mo would
go forth against Samory's accursed hordes," Goliba
declared with emphasis, removing the mouthpiece of his
long pipe from his lips. "But how dost thou intend
now to act?" he asked Omar. "Remember thou art
banished until the Naya's death. Let us hope that
Zomara will not spare her long to tyrannize over our land
and to plot against thy life," he added in a half whisper.</p>

<p>Omar started in surprise. This man, one of the
principal advisers of his royal mother, was actually expressing
a wish that she might die! It occurred to me,
too, that if her advisers were antagonistic towards her,
might not the poor, oppressed and afflicted people also be
of the same mind?</p>

<p>"Speak, O Goliba," Omar said. "Is the balance of
popular feeling actually against the Naya?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a>[<a href="./images/156.png">156</a>]</span>
"Entirely. Within the past few years the loyal spirit
hath, on account of the revolting cruelties practised by
thy royal mother, turned utterly against her. Before
thy departure to the land beyond the black water the
loyal feeling was uppermost because of the efforts of
Moloto to obtain the crown. Now, however, that the
power of his party is broken and the Naya, feeling her
position invulnerable, hath commenced a reign of terror,
disgust and despair are felt on every hand."</p>

<p>"What must I do?" Omar asked.</p>

<p>"Remain here," the sage replied. "Thou art
banished from the royal presence, it is true, but heed
not her words, and remain with thy followers in Mo.
Guard vigilantly against the attempts of secret assassins
that are certain to be made when the Naya is aware of
thy defiance, but remember thou art heir to the Emerald
Throne, and although some of the regiments may
remain loyal unto their queen, the majority of our fighting-men
are thine to command."</p>

<p>Omar knit his brows, and thought deeply for several
moments. It was apparent that this suggestion to
oppose the Naya by force of arms had never before
entered his mind.</p>

<p>"Is this really true?" he asked in a doubting tone.</p>

<p>"O Master, let thy servant Goliba perish rather than
his word be questioned. As councillor of thy queen-mother,
have I not greater facilities for testing the
popular feeling than any other man in Mo? I swear by
Zomara's wrath that what I have uttered is truth. If
thou remainest here&mdash;in hiding for a time it may be&mdash;thou
shalt either be restored to the royal favour and thy
friends recognized, or thou shalt assuredly occupy the
royal stool. The people, living as they do in constant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a>[<a href="./images/157.png">157</a>]</span>
dread of the Naya's cruelties, would hail with satisfaction
any change of rule that would ensure safety to their
persons and property. Thou art their saviour."</p>

<p>"Take the advice of our friend Goliba," I urged.
"Let us remain and defy her."</p>

<p>"Yea," cried Kona, displaying his even white teeth.
"The Dagombas are here and likely to remain. They
will fight and die to a man in thy cause. I, their head-man,
speak for them."</p>

<p>"Is it agreed?" asked Omar, glancing at us.</p>

<p>"It is," we all three answered with one voice, Kona
and Goliba fingering their amulets as they spoke.</p>

<p>"Then if it is thy will I shall remain and defy the
Naya," Omar answered, grasping the string of jujus
around his neck and muttering some words I could not
catch. "I, Omar, Prince of Mo, am thy leader in this
struggle of my people against oppression and misrule.
If they will declare in my favour I will free them. I
have spoken."</p>

<p>"Thou hast until noon to-morrow to quit this city,"
Goliba said. "Hasten not thy decision, but what I will
show thee secretly ere long will perhaps convince thee
of the terrors of the Naya's reign. I have often counselled
the queen to aspire to the virtues of truth,
wisdom, justice and moderation, the great ornaments
of the Emerald Throne, but my endeavours have been
frustrated and the fruit of my labour blasted."</p>

<p>As the white-bearded sage uttered these words, I
noticed that from behind one of the great marble pillars
of the colonnade that surrounded the courtyard of
Goliba's fine house a white robe flitted for an instant,
disappearing in the fast-falling gloom. At the moment,
sitting as we were smoking and chatting in the open air,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a>[<a href="./images/158.png">158</a>]</span>
the presence of an intruder did not strike me as strange,
and only half an hour later did I begin to fear that our
decision had been listened to by an eavesdropper,
possibly a spy in the service of the terrible queen!
When, after due reflection, I imparted my misgivings
privately to Goliba, he, however, allayed my fears,
smiling, as he said:</p>

<p>"Heed it not. It was but my slave Fiou. I saw her
also as she passed along."</p>

<p>"Then thou dost not fear spies?" I said.</p>

<p>"Not in this mine own house," he answered proudly.
"The dwelling-house of a royal councillor is exempt
from any espionage in the Naya's cause."</p>

<p>This satisfied me, and the incident escaped my recollection
entirely until long after, when I had bitter cause to remember
it, as will be seen from later chapters of this record.</p>

<p>Soon after Omar had promised to act as our leader in
his country's cause, Goliba arose, and crossing the
courtyard, now lit only by the bright stars twinkling
in the dark blue vault above, disappeared through
a door with a fine horse-shoe arch in Moorish style.
Left together, we sat cross-legged on the mat, a silent,
thoughtful trio. Omar had decided to act on the sage's
advice, and none of us knew what the result might
be. That fierce fighting and terrible bloodshed must
occur ere the struggle ended, we felt assured, but with
our mere handful of Dagombas we were certainly no
match for the trained hosts of the Naya.</p>

<p>Presently we began to discuss the matter among ourselves.
Kona, enthusiastic, yet hardly sanguine, wondered
whether the people were armed, and if not, where
we could procure guns and ammunition. Omar, on the
other hand, assured us that nearly every civilian<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a>[<a href="./images/159.png">159</a>]</span>
possessed a gun, being bound by law to acquire one
so that he might act his part in an immediate defence in
case of invasion. He had no apprehensions regarding
the materials for war; he only feared that Goliba
might be mistaken in the estimate of his popularity.</p>

<p>"If they will only stand by me they shall have freedom,"
he said decisively. "If they do not, death will
come to all of us."</p>

<p>"We are ready," Kona answered, his black face
glistening in the ray of light shed by a single lamp lit
by a slave on the opposite side of the court. "We will
serve thy cause while we have breath."</p>

<p>A few minutes later footsteps sounded on the paving,
and from the darkness of the colonnade Goliba, accompanied
by six other younger men, all tall, erect and
stately, emerged from the shadow and approached us.
Addressing Omar, the sage said:</p>

<p>"All these men are known to thee, O Master. I
need not repeat their names, but they have known thee
since their birth, and are of a verity a power in our
land. They have come hither to see thee."</p>

<p>My friend rising gave them greeting, snapped fingers
with them, and answered:</p>

<p>"I forget no face. I remember each, and I know ye are
men of might and justice. Each was ruler of a province&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All are still governors," interrupted the sage.
"They have come hither to swear allegiance to thee."</p>

<p>"It is even so, O Master," exclaimed one of the men,
hitching his rich cloak of gold-coloured silk more closely
around his shoulders. "We have met and resolved to
ask thee to defy the sentence of banishment that the
Naya hath imposed upon thee."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"></a>[<a href="./images/160.png">160</a>]</span>
"Already have I decided so to do," Omar answered.
"Have I the support of thy people, O Niaro?"</p>

<p>"To a man," the Governor answered. "For the
military we cannot, however, answer. They are ruled
by unscrupulous place-seekers, who may defend the
Naya, expecting to reap rich rewards; but such will
assuredly discover that their confidence was misplaced.
If the Naya seriously threateneth thee and thy friends,
then assuredly she shall be overthrown and thou shalt
ascend the stool in her stead."</p>

<p>"I thank thee for these expressions of good-will,"
my friend said after the remaining five had all spoken
and assured us of staunch support. "I remain in Mo
with my black companions, and when the time cometh I
am ready to take a stand in the cause against tyranny
and oppression."</p>

<p>"May the fetish be good," Niaro said, and as if with
one voice they all cried, "We will offer daily sacrifices
for the success of our arms."</p>

<p>Together we then went to a small apartment, well-furnished
in Arab style with mats, low lounges, and tiny
coffee-tables, and during the three hours that followed
the more minute details of this great conspiracy against
the tyrannical Naya were discussed and arranged, Goliba
acting as adviser upon various points.</p>

<p>As I sat listening to the conversation I fully realised
the seriousness of the great undertaking upon which we
had embarked, and I confess my confidence in our
success was by no means deep-rooted, for it was
apparent that in the revolt, if revolt became necessary,
the military would act on the side of the Naya and
suppress it with a firm, merciless hand. What apparently
was most feared by our fellow-conspirators was that in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a>[<a href="./images/161.png">161</a>]</span>
commanding the suppression of the rebellion the Naya
would give orders for a general massacre of the people.</p>

<p>To guard against this, Niaro urged the secret assassination
of the Naya immediately preceding the revolt,
but Omar, rising with that regal air he now and then
assumed, said:</p>

<p>"Give heed, O my friends, unto my words. I, Omar,
Prince of Mo, will never sanction the murder of my
mother. A Sanom hath never been a murderer. If
this step be decided, I shall withdraw from the leadership
and depart."</p>

<p>"But canst thou not see, O Prince, that a massacre
would strike panic into the hearts of the people, and
they would lay down their arms," Niaro urged.</p>

<p>"We must prevent all bloodshed that is unnecessary,"
my friend replied. "I am fully aware that in such a
struggle as the coming one it must be life for life, but I
will never be a party to my mother's murder. If the
people of Mo desire the Naya's overthrow on account
of her barbarous treatment of her subjects and the
bribery and corruption of her officials, then I, to
preserve the traditions of my ancestors, will lead
them, and act my part in their liberation, but only on
the understanding that not a hair of her head is injured."</p>

<p>The men grouped around nodded acquiescence, but
smiled.</p>

<p>"When thou hast witnessed how the Naya ruleth her
subjects, perhaps thou wilt not so readily defend her,"
one of the Governors observed. "Our ruler is not so
just nor so merciful as when thou wert last in Mo. Go,
let Goliba take thee in secret among the people, and
only when we next meet decide the point."</p>

<p>"I will never allow the Naya to fall beneath the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a>[<a href="./images/162.png">162</a>]</span>
blade or poison-cup of the assassin," Omar said
decisively. "A Sanom departeth not from the word he
hath uttered."</p>

<p>After some <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'futher'">further</ins>  discussion this horrible detail
of the conspiracy was dropped, and other matters
arranged with a coolness that utterly astounded me.</p>

<p>We were plotting to obtain a kingdom!</p>

<h3>TO THE UNKNOWN.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span>, with elaborate genuflections and vows of allegiance,
the governors of the six principal provinces of
the mystic Kingdom had taken leave of Omar, we remained
in consultation with the old sage for upwards of
another hour. He told us many horrible stories of the
Naya's fierce and unrelenting cruelty. It seemed as
though during the later years of her reign she had been
seized by an insane desire to cause just as much misery
and suffering as her predecessors on the Emerald Throne
had promoted prosperity and happiness. In every particular
her temperament was exactly opposite to the
first Naya, the good queen whose memory had, through
a thousand years, been revered as that of a goddess.</p>

<p>Goliba explained how, during the past three years, the
Great White Queen had suddenly become highly superstitious.
This was not surprising, for as far as I could
gather the people of Mo had no religion as we understand
the term, but their minds were nevertheless filled
with ideas relating to supernatural objects, by which they
sought to explain the phenomena about them of which
the causes were not immediately obvious. He told us
that the Naya, preying upon the superstitions of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a>[<a href="./images/163.png">163</a>]</span>
people, had recently introduced into the country, entirely
against the advice of himself and his fellow-councillors,
a number of customs, all of which were apparently
devised to cause death. He told us that if a great man
died his friends never now remained content with the
explanation that he died from natural causes. Their
minds flew at once to witchcraft. Some one had cast
an evil spell upon him, and it was the duty of the friends
of the dead man to discover who it was that had had
dealings with the powers of darkness. Suspicion fell
upon a certain member of the tribe, generally a relative
of the deceased, and that suspicion could only be verified
by putting the accused to the test of some dreadful
ordeal. A favourite ordeal, he said, was to make the
suspected person drink a large quantity&mdash;a gallon and a
half, or more&mdash;of a decoction of a bitter and slightly
poisonous bark. If vomiting occurred, then a verdict
of guilty was passed upon the unfortunate wretch, and
no protestations, or even direct proof of his innocence,
could save him from the tortures in store for him. The
victim was condemned to death, and death was inflicted
not swiftly and mercifully, but nearly always with some
accompaniment of diabolical torture.</p>

<p>One method was to hack the body of the wretched
person to pieces with knives, the most odious mutilations
being resorted to. Occasionally the unfortunate creature
was tied to a stake while pepper was rubbed into his
eyes until the fearful irritation so produced caused blindness.
Or, again, the victim was tied hand and foot upon
an ant-hill, and left to the agonies of being consumed
slowly by the minute aggressors. The most satisfactory
death, perhaps, was that when the condemned man was
allowed to be his own executioner. He was made much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"></a>[<a href="./images/164.png">164</a>]</span>
of for an hour or so before the final scene, and was well
fed and primed with palm wine. Under the excitement
of this mild stimulant he mounted a tree, carrying in his
hand a long rope formed of a kind of stringy vine of
tough texture. One end of this rope he fastened to a
bough, and the other he placed in a running knot over
his neck. Then, quite pleased at being the centre of
observation of the multitude, even on such a gruesome
occasion, the criminal harangued his tribesmen in a great
speech, finally declared the justice of his sentence, and
leaped into space. Should the rope break, as occasionally
happened, then the zeal of the executioner
overcame the fear of death of the victim, for he mounted
the tree nimbly once more, readjusted the knots, and did
his best in the second attempt to avoid the risk of
another fiasco.</p>

<p>"And have such pagan customs actually been introduced
during my absence in England?" asked Omar
astonished.</p>

<p>"They have, alas! O Prince," answered the sage.
"The people, taught from childhood to respect every
word that falleth from the lips of our Great White
Queen, adopted these revolting customs, together with
certain other dreadful rites, believing that only by obeying
her injunctions can they escape the wrath of the
Crocodile-god. As rapidly as fire spreadeth in the forest
the customs were adopted in every part of the kingdom,
until now the practices I have briefly enumerated are
universal."</p>

<p>"But surely my mother could never have devised such
horrible suffering out of sheer ill-will towards our
people?"</p>

<p>"Alas! she hath," answered the old man. "If thou<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a>[<a href="./images/165.png">165</a>]</span>
believest not my words, take each of you one of the
cloaks hanging yonder, wrap the Arab haicks around
your heads and follow me. Make no sign that ye are
strangers, and ye shall witness strange sights amazing."</p>

<p>We all three arose, and quickly arraying ourselves in
white cotton burnouses, wrapping the haicks around our
heads in the manner of the Arabs&mdash;a fashion adopted by
some in the City in the Clouds&mdash;and pulling them across
our faces, so as to partially conceal our features, we went
forth with our guide on the tiptoe of expectation.</p>

<p>"What sight, I wonder, are we going to witness?" I
whispered in English to Omar, as we walked together
along one of the narrow streets in the deep shadow so
that we might not be detected.</p>

<p>"I know not," my friend answered, with a heavy sigh.
"If what Goliba says is true, and I fear it is, then our
land is doomed."</p>

<p>"The power of the cruel Naya must be broken, and
you must reign and bring back to Mo her departing
prosperity and happiness," I said.</p>

<p>"I'll do my best, Scarsmere," he answered. "You
have been a true, fearless friend all along, and I feel
that you will continue until the end."</p>

<p>"Till the end!" I echoed. "The end will be peace,
either in life&mdash;or death."</p>

<p>"While I have breath I will fight to preserve the
traditions of the Nabas and the Nayas who, while ruling
their country, gave such satisfaction to the people that
never once has there been a rebellion nor scarcely a voice
raised in dissent. It has always been the policy of the
Sanoms to give audience to any discontented person,
listen to their grievances, and endeavour to redress them.
The reign of the Naya is, according to all we hear, one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a>[<a href="./images/166.png">166</a>]</span>
of terror and oppression. The poor are ground down
to swell the wealth of the rich, and no man's life is safe
from one moment to another. It shall be changed, and
I, Omar, will fulfil the duty expected of me."</p>

<p>"Well spoken, old fellow," I answered, enthusiastically.
"Remember Goliba's warning regarding the attempts that
may be made to assassinate you, and always carry your
revolver loaded. When the Naya hears that you have
defied her she will be as merciless as she was to poor
old Babila."</p>

<p>"Ah! Babila," Omar sighed. "He was one of the
best and most trusted servants Mo ever had. Having
been one of my dead father's personal attendants he
was faithful to our family, and altogether the last man
whose head should have fallen in disgrace under Gankoma's
sword."</p>

<p>"If the punishment she inflicted upon him was so severe
for such a paltry offence, that which she will seek to
bring upon you will be equally terrible," I observed.
"Therefore act always with caution, and take heed never
to be entrapped by her paid assassins."</p>

<p>"Don't fear, Scarsmere," he laughed. "I'm safe
enough, and I do not anticipate that anybody will try
and take my life. If they do they'll find I can shoot
straighter than they imagined."</p>

<p>"But they might shoot first," I suggested with a smile.</p>

<p>"I don't intend to give them a chance," he replied.
"We must not fear defeat, but anticipate success. I
have made offering to the fetish, and although the
struggle must be fierce and unrelenting I am determined
to strike a blow for my country's freedom."</p>

<p>At this juncture Goliba joined us, and urging me not
to speak in English lest the strange language might be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a>[<a href="./images/167.png">167</a>]</span>
overheard, we walked together for about three-quarters
of an hour through thoroughfares so wide and well built
that they would have been termed magnificent if constructed
in any European city. Then we crossed a
large square where a great fountain shooting up a hundred
feet fell into its bowl, green with water-plants and
white with flowers, and afterwards traversed a maze of
narrower streets, now silent and deserted, where dwelt
the workmen.</p>

<p>Suddenly Goliba halted before an arched door, and
directing us to imitate him, knelt and touched the door-step
with his forehead, then passed in. We followed
into a place that was strange to even Omar himself, who
was scarce able to suppress an exclamation of astonishment.
It was a small chamber, lit by a single flickering
oil lamp of similar shape to those so often found amid the
traces of the Roman occupation of England, while around
were stone benches built into the wall. Walking to the
opposite side of the narrow, prison-like place, we saw
before us an arch with an impenetrable blackness beyond.
Before this arch stood a kind of frame made of
iron resting on either side upon steel ropes raised
slightly from the ground. Following Goliba's example,
we got upon it, crouching in a kneeling position in the
same manner as himself.</p>

<p>"Thou wilt find handles, wherewith to steady thyself,"
he cried to me. "Have a care that thou art not thrown
off."</p>

<p>I groped with my companions, and we found the
handles of which he had spoken. Then, when all was
ready, the grave-faced sage raised some lever or another,
and we shot away down, down, down into space with such
fearful velocity that the wind whistled about our ears,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a>[<a href="./images/168.png">168</a>]</span>
our white robes fluttered, and our breath seemed taken
away.</p>

<p>The sensation was awful. In utter darkness we were
whirled along we knew not whither, until suddenly the
car whereon we travelled gave an unexpected lurch, as
a corner was turned, nearly precipitating all of us into
the darkness beneath, and then continued its downward
course with increased speed, until sparks flew from
beneath us like flecks of fire from a blacksmith's forge,
and in our breasts was a tightness that became more
painful every moment.</p>

<p>It seemed as though we were descending to some
deep, airless region, for I could not breathe; the atmosphere
felt damp and warm, and the velocity with which
we travelled was becoming greater the deeper into the
heart of the earth we went.</p>

<p>"What is this place?" I heard Omar ask. "I know it
not."</p>

<p>"Be patient, O Prince, and thou shalt witness that
which must astound thee," old Goliba shouted, his
squeaky voice being just audible above the loud hissing
as our car flew along the twisted strands of steel.</p>

<p>Suddenly, above the hiss of our rapid progress, there
could be heard strange noises, as if a hundred war-drums
were being beaten, and at the same instant our
curious conveyance gave another sudden lurch in rounding
a corner. At that moment Goliba, in turning to
speak with Omar, had unfortunately loosened his hold of
one of the handles, and the sudden jolt at such a high
speed was so violent that our faithful guide and friend
was shot off backwards, and ere Omar could clutch him
he had disappeared with a shriek of despair into the
cavernous darkness.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a>[<a href="./images/169.png">169</a>]</span>
A thrill of horror ran through us when we realised
this terrible mishap. Yet nothing could arrest our swift
headlong descent, and feeling convinced that Goliba,
our host and adviser, had met with a terrible death, we
sat staring, motionless, wondering whither we were
bound, and how, now we had lost our guide, we should
be able to reach the surface again. At the moment
Goliba had been flung off we remembered that the iron
frame had jolted and grated, and there seemed no room
for doubt that the generous sage had been mangled into
a shapeless mass. The thought was horrible.</p>

<p>At last, however, we felt the air becoming fresher,
and the strange contraction in our breasts was gradually
relieved as our pace became less rapid, and distant
lights showed before us. Then suddenly we emerged
from the curious shaft down which we had travelled to
such enormous depth, gliding slowly out into a place of
immeasurable extent, where a most extraordinary and
amazing scene met our gaze.</p>

<p>Truly, poor Goliba had spoken the truth when he had
promised that what we should witness would astound us.</p>



<hr class="full" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII"></a>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>

<h3>UNDER THE VAMPIRE'S WING.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> our dazzled gaze grew accustomed to the garish
blaze of lights we found ourselves standing in an
enormous cavern.</p>

<p>Around us were glowing fires and shining torches
innumerable; the smoke from them half choked us,
while above there seemed an immensity of darkness,
for the roof of the natural chamber was so high that
it could not be discerned.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a>[<a href="./images/170.png">170</a>]</span>
Upon one object, weird and horrible, our startled
gaze became rivetted. Straight before us, at some little
distance, there rose a great black rock to a height of,
as far as I could judge, a thousand feet. Nearly half
way up was a great wide ledge or platform larger than
any of the market-places in the City in the Clouds, and
upon this there had been fashioned from the solid
rock a colossal representation of the vampire-bat, the
device borne upon the banners of Mo. Its enormous
wings, each fully five hundred feet from the body to
tip, outstretched on either side and supported by
gigantic pillars of rock carved to represent various
grotesque and hideous figures of men and animals,
formed great temples on either side of the body. The
latter, however, attracted our attention more than did
the wonderful wings, for as we stood aghast and
amazed we discerned that the vast body of the colossus
did not represent that of a bat, but the gigantic jaws
were those of a crocodile.</p>

<p>"Zomara!" gasped Omar. "See! It is the great
god with the wings of a bat and the tail of a lion!"</p>

<p>I looked and saw that far behind rose the tufted tail
of the king of the forest. From the two great eyes of
the gigantic reptile shone dazzling streams of white
light, like the rays of a mariner's beacon, and everywhere
twinkling yellow lights were moving about the face of
the great rock, across the platform whereon the colossal
figure rested, even to the distant summit.</p>

<p>Suddenly, as we stood gazing open-mouthed in wonder,
the roar of a hundred war-drums beaten somewhere in
the vicinity of the enormous representation of the
terrible deity of Mo rolled and echoed to the innermost
recesses of the subterranean vault, and just as they had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a>[<a href="./images/171.png">171</a>]</span>
ceased we distinctly saw the giant jaws of the crocodile
slowly open. From them belched forth great tongues
of flame and thick stifling smoke that, beaten down by a
draught from above, curled its poisonous fumes around
us, causing us to cough violently. For fully a minute
the great mouth remained open, when to our horror we
saw a small knot of human figures approaching it. One
loud piercing shriek reached us and at that instant we
saw the figure of a man or woman&mdash;we were not close
enough to discern which&mdash;flung by the others headlong
into the open flaming mouth.</p>

<p>Again the drums rolled, and the next second the jaws
of Zomara closed with a loud crash that sent a shudder
through us.</p>

<p>"The sacrifice!" gasped Omar. "This, then, is one
of the horrible customs that Goliba told us had been
introduced by my mother, the Great White Queen!"</p>

<p>"Horrible!" I exclaimed. "That fearful cry will
haunt me to my dying day."</p>

<p>"Let us return," said Kona. "We have witnessed
enough, O Master."</p>

<p>"No," Omar answered. "Rather let us see for
ourselves the true extent of these terrible rites. Goliba,
though, alas! he is lost for ever, intended that we should."</p>

<p>"Very well," I said. "Lead us, and we will follow."</p>

<p>At that moment footsteps, pattering as those of
children, reached our ears and there ran past us half a
dozen hideous half-clad dwarfs. They were tiny, impish-looking
creatures about three feet six high, with darker
skins than the inhabitants of this mystic land, but their
faces were whitewashed in manner similar to those of the
royal executioners of Ashanti, and wore their crisp black
hair drawn to a knot on top similar to the fashion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"></a>[<a href="./images/172.png">172</a>]</span>
affected by some savage tribes. As they rushed past us
their little black eyes, piercing and bead-like, regarded
us curiously, and with, we thought, a rather menacing
glance; nevertheless they continued their way, and watching,
we noticed the spot where they commenced the toilsome
ascent to the platform whereon stood the colossus.</p>

<p>"Such a work as that must have taken years to accomplish,"
I observed to Omar.</p>

<p>"With the Sanoms of Mo everything is possible," he
answered. "The ruler of our country is a monarch
whose will is so absolute that he or she can compel everyone,
from prince to slave, to participate in any work.
Thus the Naya may have caused every male inhabitant
of Mo to help in its construction."</p>

<p>When, however, following the dwarfs we had hurried
forward to the steps cut in the black rock I bent to
examine them. They were polished by the wear of ages
of feet and hands passing over them, and when I pointed
out this fact to Omar he agreed with me that this place
must have been in existence centuries ago, and had
probably been re-discovered within the last two or three
years.</p>

<p>The dwarfs, in ascending, put their toes into holes
and niches in the rocks and kept talking all the while.
Every now and then they would stop, sway their heads
about and sing a kind of low chant in not unmusical
tones. As we crept up slowly behind, with difficulty
finding the rude steps in the uncertain light, the last of
the string of dwarfs kept turning to us bowing and
crooning. I confess I began to be anxious, fearing that
we might be going into a trap, but I noticed that my
two companions were calm as iron bars. This gave
me renewed courage, and we toiled up until at last we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a>[<a href="./images/173.png">173</a>]</span>
reached the great platform and stood beneath the left-hand
wing of the gigantic vampire of solid rock. The
pillars that had been left in the excavations to support
it, were, like the steps, worn smooth where crowds of
human beings had jostled against them. The manner in
which they were sculptured was very remarkable, the
faces of all, both men, beasts, birds and fish, bearing
hideous, uncanny expressions, the fearful grimaces of
those suffering the most excruciating bodily tortures. It
was here apparent, as everywhere, that the gigantic figure
had not been recently fashioned, but had for many
centuries past been visited by vast crowds of worshippers.</p>

<p>Beneath the outstretched wing under which we stood
a large number of people had assembled. Great
blazing braziers here and there illuminated the weird
place with a red uncertain glare, which falling on the
faces of the crowd of devotees, showed that they had
worked themselves into a frenzy of religious fervour.
Some were crying aloud to the Crocodile-god, some
were prostrate on their faces with their lips to the stones
worn smooth by the tramp of many feet, while many
were going through all sorts of ceremonies and antics.</p>

<p>At the end, where the colossal wing joined the
body wherein burned the great fiery furnace, there
stood twelve dwarfs in flowing garments of pure white.
These were high-priests of Zomara. The fierce pigmies,
unknown even to Omar, their prince, seemed a
sacred tribe who perhaps had lived here forgotten and
undiscovered for generations. In any case it was
apparent that they never ascended to the land above, but
devoted themselves entirely to the curious rites and ceremonies
of this strange pagan religion.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a>[<a href="./images/174.png">174</a>]</span>
In the centre of the semi-circle of tiny bead-eyed
priests with whitened faces stood one of great age
with flowing white beard that nearly swept the ground.
His figure was exceedingly grotesque, yet he bore himself
with hauteur, and as he stood before a kind of
altar erected in front of a door, that seemed to lead into
the body of the gigantic crocodile, he gave vent in a loud
clear voice to the most earnest exhortations. Then, bathing
his face and hands in a golden bowl held by the other
priests, in order, so I afterwards learnt, to wash away the
bad impressions of the world, he thus began an instructive
lesson:</p>

<p>"Give ear, ye tender branches, unto the words of your
parent stock; bend to the lessons of instruction and
imbibe the maxims of age and experience! As the ant
creepeth not to its labour till led by its elders; as the
young lark soareth not to the sun, but under the shadow of
its mother's wing, so neither doth the child of mortality
spring forth to action unless the parent hand points out
its destined labour. But no labour shall the hand of
man appoint unto the people of Mo before the worship
of Zomara, the sacred god of the crocodiles, and of the
great Naya, his handmaiden. Mean are the pursuits of
the sons of the earth; they stretch out their sinews like
the patient mule, they persevere in their chase after
trifles, as the camel in the desert beyond the Thousand
Steps. As the leopard springeth upon his prey, so doth
man rejoice over his riches, and bask in the sun of
slothfulness like the lion's cub. On the stream of life
float the bodies of the careless and the intemperate as
the carcases of the dead on the waves of the Lake of
Sacrifices. As the birds of prey destroy the carcase so
is man devoured by sin. No man is master over him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a>[<a href="./images/175.png">175</a>]</span>self,
but the Naya is his ruler; and to endeavour to
defeat the purpose of Zomara is madness and folly. O
people! pay your vows to the King of Crocodiles
alone, and not to your fetishes, which, though they be
superior in your sight, are yet the work of his hands. Let
virtue be the basis of knowledge, and let knowledge be
as a slave before her."</p>

<p>The worshippers at the shrine of the dread god raising
their right hands then repeated after the high priest some
mystic words that, although having no meaning for me,
struck terror into Omar's heart.</p>

<p>"Hearken!" he whispered to me in an awed tone<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: added missing period">.</ins>
"Hearken! Our conspiracy against the Naya is already
known! They are swearing allegiance to her, and vowing
vengeance against any who thwart her will. If we
are detected here as strangers it will mean certain death!"</p>

<p>I glanced around the strange, weird place, and could
not suppress a feeling of despair that we should ever
leave it again alive. The faces of the worshippers, men
and women, illuminated by flaming flambeaux and burning
braziers, were all fierce and determined-looking,
showing that the worship of the Crocodile-god was conducted
in no faint spirit. Before this gigantic representation
of the national deity, they became seized with a
religious mania that transformed them into veritable
demons.</p>

<p>"Lo!" cried the silver-bearded priest. "Think, O
people! of all our Great White Queen hath done for
you. She hath brought down the moon's rays from the
realms of night to lighten our darkness, she hath marked
the courses of the stars with her wand and reduced
eccentric orbs to the obedience of a system. She hath
caught the swift-flying light and divided its rays; she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a>[<a href="./images/176.png">176</a>]</span>
hath marshalled the emanations of the sun under their
different-hued banners, given symmetry and order to the
glare of day, explained the dark eternal laws of the
Forest-god, and showed herself always acquainted with
the dictates of Zomara."</p>

<p>His hearers, swaying their bodies and performing all
sorts of eccentric antics, cried aloud in confirmation of
the benefits bestowed upon Mo by its queen.</p>

<p>"The secrets, too, of chemistry have been laid open
by her," continued the diminutive priest. "Inert matter
is engaged in warlike commotion and she hath brought
fire down from the heavens to entertain her. She hath
placed our land in such a state of defence that no invader
can approach it; she hath brought from over the great
black water the amazing 'pom-poms' of the English,
which shed a thousand bullets at one charge, and she
hath caused cannon to be cast to project explosive shells
beyond the reach of the eye. She hath taught you at
once the beauty of nature and the folly of man. Truly
she is a great queen; therefore let not her son Omar who
hath returned from over the great sea, wrest from her
hand the regal sceptre. Already hath our queen perceived
the haughtiness and the vicious principles of her
son, and maketh no doubt but that he will soon aspire
to her throne. This causeth the prudent Mistress of Mo
to resolve to banish him and take all power from him.
Let him be ejected from our country and the queen's
word be obeyed, for no beam of mercy lurketh in her
eye. The Naya is determined."</p>

<p>"The great Naya shall be obeyed," they cried aloud.
"Omar, the malicious prince, curbed by the authority of
his mother, shall be banished."</p>

<p>"Or his life shall, like those of his followers we hold<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a>[<a href="./images/177.png">177</a>]</span>
here as prisoners, pay the forfeit of presumption," added
the high priest.</p>

<p>And as he uttered the words, those surrounding went
to the door behind the fire-altar, and opening it, led forth
three of our Dagombas amid the savage howls of the
excited spectators.</p>

<p>"O, race of mortals," cried the priest, raising his hand
the while, "O race of mortals, to whose care and protection
the offspring of clay are committed, say what hath
been the success of your labours; what vices have you
punished; what virtues rewarded; what false lights have
you extinguished; what sacrifices have you made to the
god of Crocodiles? Helpless race of mortals, Zomara is
your god and the Naya your queen. But for their protection
how vain would be your toils, how endless your
researches! Arm ye then and rally round the one to
whom you owe all, whose power is such that this our
country can never be assaulted by the tricks of fortune,
or the power of man. Omar and his black swarm of
intruders must be driven out or given as sacrifice to
Zomara. Till this be done the curse of the god ye
fear shall rest upon our land, and his presence shall
nightly remind ye of your idleness. Will ye let the
defiant prince overthrow your queen?"</p>

<p>"He shall never do so," they shouted in a tumult of
enthusiasm, which, ere it died away, increased tenfold,
when suddenly before us we saw a female figure in a loose
yellow robe move with stately mien towards the smoking
altar and kneel for an instant before it.</p>

<p>Then, rising, she turned towards the people with her
long, bare, scraggy arms uplifted in silence.</p>

<p>In the red flickering light we recognized the evil
bony features. It was the dreaded Naya herself!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"></a>[<a href="./images/178.png">178</a>]</span>
"The vengeance of Zomara upon mine enemies," she
cried in harsh, metallic tones. "I will treat each and
every one who dareth to oppose me in the way I will
now punish these three savages who have entered our
region forbidden. Watch, and let it be a warning to
those who may be tempted by bribes to entertain disloyal
thoughts."</p>

<p>With stately stride she led the way along a dark
colonnade from beneath the wing of the colossal
vampire to the enormous closed mouth of the hideous
crocodile, being followed by the high priest and his
attendants, who dragged along the three of our unfortunate
companions.</p>

<p>At once a headlong rush was made by the frenzied
spectators to obtain a view of what was to transpire, and
we followed leisurely at a respectable distance, remaining
in the shadow of one of the grotesquely-carved columns
of rock.</p>

<p>When all had taken up their places we could see the
expressions of abject fear upon the glistening faces of
the wretched blacks, and longed to rush forth and
rescue them, but with knowledge that instant death
would result from such foolhardiness we remained
breathlessly silent, compelled to watch.</p>

<p>Again the high priest, with outstretched hands over
the people, cried:</p>

<p>"Give heed unto me! Were Zomara, the god whom
we worship, to be worshipped in perfectness, the whole
length of our lives would not suffice to lie prostrate
before him. But the merciful Avenger of Wrong expecteth
not more from us than we are able to pay him.
True it is that we should begin early, and late take rest,
and daily and hourly offer up our praises and petitions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"></a>[<a href="./images/179.png">179</a>]</span>
to the throne of his handmaiden's grace. But better is
a late repentance than none; and the eleventh hour of
the day for work than perpetual idleness unto the end of
our time; and this is not to be obtained for us but
through our mighty Naya, the daughter of Zomara the
Swallower-up of Evil."</p>

<p>Himself facing the hideous gigantic head with its long
jaws and gleaming eyes, he flung himself suddenly
upon his knees and commenced a gabbled prayer. All
prostrated themselves in adoration, even to the great
Naya herself, whose magnificent jewels flashed and
gleamed with wondrous brilliancy each time she moved.</p>

<p>In order not to appear strange to this extraordinary
proceeding, we, too, cast ourselves upon our knees and
remained with heads bent in devotional attitude, but
allowing no detail of the weird scene to escape us.</p>

<p>Suddenly the priest arose, and with a fire-brand
ignited at the brazier near his hand, he stood before the
wonderful figure of Zomara and made a mystic sign.</p>

<p>Instantly the ponderous jaws with their double row
of iron teeth, each as long and as sharp as swords,
slowly opened, and there issued forth a great roaring mass
of flame that licked the upper jaw, a veritable tongue
of fire.</p>

<p>The Naya rose, swaying her long arms wildly, but
the people remained still kneeling, silent in awe.</p>

<p>Her voice was heard for a moment above the roaring
and crackling of the furnace in the throat of the
colossus, and then, at a sudden signal from the high
priest, our three wretched black companions were seized
by the group of dwarfs, carried up a short flight of
steps by white-robed attendants, and hurled headlong
into the flaming mouth of the monster.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"></a>[<a href="./images/180.png">180</a>]</span>
A loud scream broke upon our ears, and for a single
instant the flames belched forth with increased fury, but
as the last victim of this horrible rite was consigned to
his terrible doom, as sacrifice to the dreaded god, the
cruel jaws closed again with a heavy clang.</p>

<p>The merciless barbarity of the Great White Queen
horrified us. The fearful fate of those who had shared our
perils during our adventurous journey to this spectral
land of mystery held us dumb in terror and dismay.</p>

<p>Yet, ere the giant jaws of the hideous monstrosity
had snapped together, the people, hilarious and excited,
sprang to their feet exhorting their great deity to send
his fiercest vengeance upon us, the intruders, that our
sinews might be withered and that we might rot by the
road-side like cattle smitten by the pest.</p>

<p>Then the terrible Naya, wheeling round slowly, gave
her people her blessing, and they, in turn, shouted
themselves hoarse in frantic adulation.</p>

<p>Truly, the scene was the strangest and most weird that
my eyes had ever gazed upon.</p>



<hr class="full" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>

<h3>THE FLAMING MOUTH.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">We</span> stood rooted to the spot. The hideous colossus,
the intensely white light streaming from its gigantic
eyes, seemed to tower above us to an enormous height,
its outstretched wings threatening to enclose the great
swaying crowd of fanatical worshippers. With monotonous
regularity the long jaws, worked by hidden
levers, fell apart, disclosing the terrible pointed teeth
against a roaring background of smoke and flame, and so
frenzied had the people now become, that each time the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181"></a>[<a href="./images/181.png">181</a>]</span>
mouth of the monster idol opened, numbers of wild-haired
men and women rushed up the incline that led
to the blazing furnace, and with loud cries of adoration
of their deity, lifted their arms above their heads and
cast themselves into the flames. Some fell clear of the
double row of pointed teeth into the furnace, while
others not leaping sufficiently far were impaled upon
the great spikes of steel, and in full view of their
companions writhed in frightful agonies, as slowly they
were consumed by the tongue of fire lapping about them.</p>

<p>The scene was awful, yet the Naya, surrounded by
priestly dwarfs, stood regarding it with satisfaction. Such
voluntary sacrifices to Zomara, were, to them, gratifying
in the highest degree.</p>

<p>Suddenly the light in the eyes of the giant figure
changed from white to a deep blood-red, illuminating
the strange place with a ruddy glow that increased its
weirdness, and was a signal for a large number of sacrifices.
Indeed, the worshippers now lost their self-control
absolutely, and when the horrible mouth, dripping
with blood, again unclosed, there was such a press of
those anxious to immolate themselves, that many could
not struggle forward to cast their bodies into the flames
before the teeth again snapped together.</p>

<p>It was horrible. Nauseated by the sickening sight of
men impaled and absolutely crushed to a pulp by the
ascending jaw which must have weighed many tons, and
the sharp teeth of which cut the unfortunate wretch to
pieces, we turned away. We had emerged from the
shadow that had concealed us and stood in the full white
light shed by one of the monster's eyes, hesitating how
to seek some means of escape, when two of the dwarfs,
suddenly turning a corner, came full upon me. In an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"></a>[<a href="./images/182.png">182</a>]</span>
instant I remembered that on account of the suffocating
atmosphere I had unwrapped my haick from about my
mouth, thus allowing my features to remain uncovered.
But ere this thought flashed across my mind the uncanny-looking
imps had detected my features as those
of a stranger.</p>

<p>For a second they paused, starting and glancing keenly
at me, then they turned and gazed earnestly at my
companions. There was, I knew, no mistaking Kona's
sable yet good-humoured face.</p>

<p>"Lo!" they cried, shouting to the group of their
priestly tribe standing rigid and silent around the bejewelled
Naya. "See! There are strangers present!
One is a black savage like those thou hast given unto
Zomara, and the other white, like the people dwelling
beyond the great black water."</p>

<p>Their announcement produced an effect almost
electrical. In an instant a silence fell, and at the same
moment the voice of the Naya was heard commanding:</p>

<p>"If they are strangers who have dared to descend to
this our Temple of Zomara, bring them forth, and let
them be given unto the great god whose maw still
remaineth unsatisfied. Hasten, ye priests, do my
bidding quickly; let them not escape, or the curse of
the King of the Crocodiles be upon you."</p>

<p>The two dwarfs sprang forward to seize us, while
the group of priests, fleet of foot, accompanied by the
great mob of worshippers, sped in our direction. The
people, having worked themselves up to such a pitch
of excitement, were eager to assist in the immolation
of any intruders. They were bent upon obeying the
law of their queen.</p>

<p>But in an instant Kona felled both the dwarfs with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a>[<a href="./images/183.png">183</a>]</span>
two well-directed blows with his huge black fist, and
without hesitation we all three turned and fled in the
direction we had come. My companions had apparently
forgotten where the steps descended, but fortunately
I had fixed the spot in case any untoward
incident occurred. They were over against a great
pillar of rock, rudely fashioned to represent a woman
with an eagle's head.</p>

<p>"This way," I shouted. "Follow me!" and with
a bound sped in its direction as fast as my legs could
carry me.</p>

<p>We had nearly gained the spot when to my dismay
I saw a dozen of the worshippers, divining our intention,
approaching from the opposite direction in order
to cut off our retreat.</p>

<p>It was an exciting moment. Behind, was a mad,
fanatical mob of five hundred men and women led by
the dwarfs shrieking vengeance against us; before us
were a dozen determined men ready to seize us and
convey us to a horrible death in the throat of the
gigantic representation of their sacred reptile. Even if
we safely descended the steps, we knew not the secret
means by which we might reach the earth's surface, nor
did either of us remember the exact point where the
long dark tunnel joined the wonderful cavern.</p>

<p>None, however, knew that Omar himself was one of
my fellow fugitives, for the dwarfs, being consigned to
a subterranean life perpetually, had never set eyes upon
him, and therefore he had been unrecognized. Another
moment, and I knew he must be detected by some
of the devotees. If so, the hostile feeling against us
would be intensified, and we should probably be torn
limb from limb.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a>[<a href="./images/184.png">184</a>]</span>
I had retained the lead in this race for life, and seeing
retreat cut off by the group of men gaining the top of
the steps before us I turned quickly, and, although
fearing the worst, made a long detour. Determined to
sell my life dearly, I drew my long knife from its velvet
sheath, and gripped it, ready to strike a deadly blow in
self-defence. Luckily I armed myself in time, for
almost next moment a man of huge stature sprang
forward from behind one of the columns of rock where
he had been secreted and threw himself upon me,
clutching me by the throat.</p>

<p>Scarce had his sinewy fingers gripped me, when, by
dint of frantic effort, I freed my right arm, and with a
movement quick as lightning flash, I buried my knife
full in his breast. One short, despairing cry escaped
him, and as he staggered back I dashed forward again,
without turning to look at the result of the swift blow
I had delivered. But I was desperate, and being
compelled to defend my life, I do not doubt that
my blow was unerring, and that my blade penetrated
his heart.</p>

<p>Hindered thus in my flight my two companions had
reached the edge of the precipice ahead of me, and
were skirting it, when suddenly I saw a body of our
pursuers approaching, and cried to them in warning.
In dismay I noticed they took no heed of my words,
but continued their swift flight right in the direction of
those who sought our destruction.</p>

<p>"Take care, Omar!" I shouted, in English. "Can't
you see those devils in front?"</p>

<p>But he answered not, and I was about to halt and
give up all thought of escape, when I saw them both
suddenly throw themselves on their knees on the edge<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a>[<a href="./images/185.png">185</a>]</span>
of the abyss, and almost instantly disappear over the
precipice.</p>

<p>They had found another flight of steps!</p>

<p>Eagerly I sprang forward, and in a few seconds found
myself descending the rough face of the rock, scrambling
desperately down into the yawning chasm with a wild
horde of excited fanatics shrieking and yelling above.</p>

<p>Half a dozen of the more adventurous swung themselves
over and commenced to follow us, but those
above, determined that we should not escape, fetched
huge stones and lumps of rock, which they hurled upon
us. But their excess of zeal only wrought destruction
upon their companions, who, being above us, received
blows from the great stones which sent them flying one
after another to the base of the rock, killed or stunned
ere they reached it. Twice we had narrow escapes on
account of the unconscious bodies of our pursuers or
their companions' missiles falling against us, but while all
those who had followed us, save one, fell victims to the
merciless frenzy of their companions, we were fortunate
enough to be enabled to descend to the base of the
rock, where once again the impenetrable darkness hid,
although at the same time it hampered, our movements.</p>

<p>For a few moments at least we were safe, and paused
to recover breath. My arm was bleeding profusely
where it had been severely grazed by a sharp edge of
rock in our headlong flight, and the white garments of
all three of us were soiled and torn. But our halt was
not of long duration, for suddenly we heard whispers
and the sound of stealthy footsteps in the darkness.</p>

<p>We listened breathlessly.</p>

<p>"Hark!" cried Omar. "Our pursuers are here also,
and are looking for us!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"></a>[<a href="./images/186.png">186</a>]</span>
"Let us hide behind yonder rock," Kona suggested,
in a half-whisper.</p>

<p>"No, let us creep forward," answered the son of the
Great White Queen. "They will search every crevice
and hiding-place now the hue-and-cry has been raised,"
and glancing up I saw a black stream of excited
worshippers, many with torches that in the distance
shone like moving stars, already pouring down over the
rock in our direction like a line of ants descending a wall.</p>

<p>Every moment brought them nearer upon us; every
instant increased our peril. Even though we were in
the great chasm, the true extent of which we could not
distinguish, we knew not by what means we could escape
upward to the blessed light of day.</p>

<p>Forward we crept cautiously, in obedience to Omar's
instructions, but ere a couple of minutes had elapsed
it was evident that the watchful ones who had heard
the shouting from above and noticed the pursuit had discovered
our whereabouts, for just as we had noiselessly
passed a huge boulder, a man in white robe and turban
sprang upon us from behind.</p>

<p>"Look out, Kona!" cried Omar, his quick eyes discerning
the man's cloak in the darkness ere I noticed
his presence.</p>

<p>Next second, however, the head-man of the Dagombas
and the stranger were locked in deadly embrace, notwithstanding
that the man who had approached cried
aloud to us for mercy.</p>

<p>Kona with drawn sword had gripped the man's throat
with his long black fingers, when suddenly we heard a
gasping cry: "Stay thine hand! Dost thou not recognize
thy benefactor?"</p>

<p>"Hold!" shouted Omar, the words causing him to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a>[<a href="./images/187.png">187</a>]</span>
turn and run back to where the pair were struggling.
"Knowest thou not the voice? Why, it is Goliba!"</p>

<p>And it was Goliba! Instantly the black giant released
the man who he believed intended to arrest our progress,
and with a word of apology we all four sped
forward. How our aged host had escaped after being
thrown from the frame in which we had made the
descent from the city we knew not until later, when he
explained that on recovering consciousness and finding
himself on his back in the tunnel with a slight injury
to his shoulder, he had scrambled down the perilous
descent, fearing each moment that he might slip in the
impenetrable darkness and be dashed to pieces ere he
gained the bottom. Intensely anxious as to our fate,
he had at last descended in safety, but on emerging
from the tunnel found proceeding above all the commotion
the discovery of our presence had caused. He
watched our descent into the chasm and stood below
awaiting us, but we had rushed past ere he could make
himself known, and he had therefore dashed across to
a corner and thus come up with us.</p>

<p>But our meeting, too hurried and full of peril to
admit of explanation at that moment, was at any rate
gratifying&mdash;for we all three had believed him dead.
Our pursuers were now behind us in full cry. A
number of them had gained the base of the rock and,
yelling furiously, were fast gaining upon us.</p>

<p>"Come, let us hasten," cried the old sage, speeding
along with a fleetness of foot equal to our own, skirting
the base of the great rock for a short distance until we
came to a portion that jutted out over the uneven
ground, then suddenly turning aside, we crossed a great
open space where mud and water splashed beneath our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"></a>[<a href="./images/188.png">188</a>]</span>
feet at every step. The further we went the deeper
sank our feet into the quagmire, until our progress was
so far arrested that we could not run, but only wade
slowly through the chill black slime.</p>

<p>Even across here our progress was traced, for the
lights in the eyes of the giant god were turned upon
us, and our path lit by a stream of white light which
guided the footsteps of those who sought our death.</p>

<p>At last, when we had crossed the boggy patch, the
ground became quite dry again, but after running some
distance further, which showed me that the natural
chamber must have been of huge proportions, Goliba
shouted to us to halt and remain there. We obeyed
him, puzzled and wondering, but we saw him dashing
hither and thither as if in search of something. At
first it was apparent that he could not discover what
he sought, but in a few minutes when our pursuers had
crossed the quagmire and were quite close upon us he
shouted to us to come forward. Together we obeyed
instantly, speeding as fast as our legs could carry us to
where Goliba was standing before a small fissure in the
side of the cavern on a level with the ground, and so
narrow that it did not appear as if Kona would be able
to squeeze his big body through.</p>

<p>"Follow me," the old sage said in a low tone as,
throwing himself down before the mysterious hole, he
crept forward, being compelled to lie almost flat on his
stomach, so small was the fissure.</p>

<p>His example we all quietly followed, finding ourselves
groping forward in the darkness, but discovering to our
satisfaction that the further we proceeded the wider the
crack in the rock became, so that before long we were
enabled to walk upright, although we deemed it best to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a>[<a href="./images/189.png">189</a>]</span>
hold our hands above our heads lest we should strike
them against any projecting stones.</p>

<p>Without light, and in air that was decidedly close and
oppressive, we proceeded. At least we were safe from
the howling mob, for since leaving the great cavern all was
silence, and it was now evident from the confident manner
in which Goliba went forward that he was assured of
the way. Soon we negotiated a steep ascent, now and
then so difficult that we were compelled to clamber up
on all fours, and for a long time this continued until
our hands and feet were sore with scrambling upward.
A spring shed its icy drippings upon us for some little
distance, soaking us to the skin and rendering us chilly
and uncomfortable, but at length we reached what
seemed to be a ponderous door that barred our passage.</p>

<p>Goliba groped about for a few minutes without speaking,
when quickly it opened to his touch and we found
ourselves in a long stone passage lit here and there by
evil-smelling oil lamps that flickered in the rush of air
from the great fissure through which we had ascended.</p>

<p>"This is amazing," cried Omar dumbfounded, as the
old sage struggled to close the heavy iron door behind us.
"Why, we are in the vaults beneath the palace!"</p>

<p>"True, O Master," Goliba answered, breathless after
his exertions. "There is but one entrance and one
exit to this labyrinth of vaults and foul chambers
wherein the Naya confineth her prisoners. The entrance
is, as thou knowest, immediately beneath the Emerald
Throne; the exit is this door, which can only be
opened by those possessed of the secret. Thirty
years ago, when Keeper of the Prison, this door puzzled
me considerably, for all attempts to open it on the
part of the men I employed failed. It is of such con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a>[<a href="./images/190.png">190</a>]</span>struction
and mechanism that nothing short of
explosives could make it yield, and these I feared to
use. But years afterwards a gaoler who had obtained
the secret from his father, also a gaoler, but who was dead,
imparted it to me on his death-bed in return for some
good-will I had shown him. I believe therefore that I
am the only person who has knowledge of the means by
which to open it."</p>

<p>"The knowledge hath, in any case, saved our lives,
Goliba," Omar answered<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: added missing period">.</ins> "But the great cavern and
all those horrible rites introduced into the worship of
Zomara, are not they new?"</p>

<p>"No," replied the sage. "They are as old as the
foundation of the Kingdom of Mo. Strangely enough,
however, the great cave with its colossus and its race
of sacred dwarfs who live away in a small dark forest
that can only be gained from the opposite side of the
cave, were for centuries forgotten. The way to the
Temple of Zomara was unknown and the dwarfs remained
in undisputed possession of the place until
three years ago, one more adventurous than the rest,
succeeded in ascending to Mo, when his capture resulted
in the cavern with its great wonderful image being
re-discovered. Since that time the place has never
been devoid of votaries, and the great fire has constantly
been fed by those anxious to immolate themselves to
appease the Crocodile-god."</p>

<p>"Ah! he is a great god," Omar observed earnestly.</p>

<p>"Yea, O Master, he is indeed all-powerful," answered
the aged councillor. "He giveth us life, preserveth us
from death, and shieldeth us from evil."</p>

<p>And as they uttered these words both fingered their
amulets piously.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV"></a>CHAPTER XXV.</h2>

<h3>LIOLA.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">After</span> brief consultation it was deemed insecure
for us to return to Goliba's house, as search would
undoubtedly be made for us there if any had detected
his presence with us in the great chasm. Therefore, our
guide, taking one of the lamps, led us along a number of
narrow unlighted passages, threading the maze with
perfect knowledge of its intricacies until, opening a door,
we found ourselves in a small stone prison-chamber.
Here we remained while he went to another part of the
vaults and obtained for us some food, urging us to
remain there until such time as we might come forth
in safety.</p>

<p>Kona extracted from him a promise that he would
place his fellow-tribesmen in a place of security, and
Goliba also assured us that if we remained in that
chamber and did not attempt to wander in the passages,
where we must inevitably lose our way, we might ere long
ascend to the city and commence the campaign against
the cruel command of the merciless Naya.</p>

<p>Through eleven long and dreary days we remained in
the narrow cell, drawing our water from a spring that
gushed forth from a rock close to the door, existing on
the smallest quantity of food, and scarce daring to speak
aloud lest any of the gaolers should overhear. By day
a faint light came through a narrow chink above, and
from the fact that the steady tramp of soldiers sounded
overhead at intervals we concluded that the chamber
must be situated immediately below one of the court<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a>[<a href="./images/192.png">192</a>]</span>yards
of the palace. At night, however, we remained in
perfect darkness, our oil having been exhausted during
the first few hours. Thus we could only remain sitting
on the stone bench like prisoners, inactive, discussing
the probabilities of the serious movement that had been
started in favour of a change of rule.</p>

<p>"The people apparently look to me as their rescuer
from this oppression," Omar observed one day when we
were laying plans for the future. "I will, if Zomara
favours me, do my best."</p>

<p>"It is but right; nay, it is your duty towards your
subjects to preserve the traditions of the Sanoms," I
said. "Goliba was right when he promised he would
show us the horrors introduced into Mo, or resuscitated
by the present Naya. We have witnessed with our own
eyes expressions of pleasure cross her countenance
as each batch of her subjects cast themselves into those
yawning jaws. Such a monarch, capable of any cruelty,
must necessarily rule unjustly, and should be overthrown
or killed."</p>

<p>"I do not desire her death," he said quickly. "All I
intend to do is to free our people from this hateful reign
of terror, and at the same time preserve my mother's life."</p>

<p>"But the time she gave us to quit the country has
elapsed," I observed. "If we are now discovered we
shall either be held as slaves, or treated without mercy&mdash;offered
as sacrifices to the Crocodile-god, perhaps."</p>

<p>"Not while the people are in our favour," he said.
"Once their adherence to my cause has been tested then
we have nought further to fear, for the opinion of the
populace will be found even of greater power than the
military, and in the end it must prevail."</p>

<p>"In the fight that must ensue thou wilt find thy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a>[<a href="./images/193.png">193</a>]</span>
servant Kona at thy side," the head-man said. "Through
fire or across water the Dagombas will follow thee, for
their fetish is good, and they have faith in thee as leader."</p>

<p>"Yea, O friend," the young prince answered. "Without
thee and thy followers I could never have returned
hither. I owe everything to thee, and to the stout heart
of our companion Scarsmere."</p>

<p>"No, old fellow," I protested. "It is your own
dogged courage that has pulled us through so far, not
mine. Up to the present all has gone well with us
except the deplorable loss of some of our dark companions,
therefore let us retain our light hearts and meet
all obstacles with smiles."</p>

<p>"I am ready to lead the people against the forces of
malice and oppression at any moment Goliba commands,"
Omar answered. "No thought of fear shall arrest my
footsteps or stay my hand."</p>

<p>Times without number we discussed the situation in
similar strain, until, on the eleventh day of our voluntary
confinement we were startled by a low tapping on the
door.</p>

<p>Each held his breath. Had it been Goliba he would
have entered without any such formality. In silence, we
remained listening.</p>

<p>Again the tapping was repeated, louder than before.
Drawing our knives ready to defend ourselves, believing
it to be one of the Naya's gaolers, Kona went forward,
unbolted the door and opening it a few inches, weapon
in hand, peered out.</p>

<p>Instantly an exclamation of surprise escaped him, and
as he threw wide open the door, a young girl of about
seventeen, with a face more beautiful than I had ever
before seen, entered our cell. This vision of feminine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a>[<a href="./images/194.png">194</a>]</span>
loveliness entranced us. We all three stood staring at
her open-mouthed.</p>

<p>Dressed in a robe of rich blue silk heavily embroidered
with gold, her waist was confined by a golden girdle
wherein were set some magnificent rubies, and her feet
were encased in tiny slippers of pale green leather
embroidered with seed pearls. Her face, slightly flushed
in confusion at finding herself in the presence of the
Prince, was pale of complexion as my own, her clear
eyes a deep blue, her cheeks dimpled, her chin just
sufficiently pointed to give a touch of piquancy to a
decidedly handsome countenance. Her hair, of almost
flaxen fairness, fell in profusion about her shoulders and
breast, almost hiding the necklets of gold and gems
encircling her slim throat.</p>

<p>Little wonder then was it that Kona's black visage
should broaden into a wide grin in manner habitual
when his eyes fell upon anything that pleased him,
or that I should regard her as a most perfect type of
feminine loveliness.</p>

<p>"I seek Omar, the Prince," she said in a silvery voice,
not, however, without some trepidation.</p>

<p>"I am Omar," answered my friend. "Who, pray,
art thou, that thou shouldst know of my hiding-place?"</p>

<p>"Thy servant," she said with a graceful bow, "is called
Liola, daughter of Goliba, councillor of the great Naya.
My father sendeth thee greeting and a message."</p>

<p>"Goliba's daughter!" Omar cried laughing. "And
we had drawn knives upon thee!"</p>

<p>"Sheathe them," she answered smiling upon us. "Keep
them in your belts until ye meet your enemies, for ere
long ye will, of a verity, want them."</p>

<p>"What then hath transpired?" asked the son of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"></a>[<a href="./images/195.png">195</a>]</span>
Great White Queen. "What message sendeth our friend
Goliba?"</p>

<p>"My father directed me to come hither, for knowing
the wife of the Keeper of the Prison I was enabled to
pass the sentries where my father would have been remarked,"
she said. "He sendeth thee word to be of
good courage, for all goeth well, and thy cause prospereth.
The savages who accompanied thee into our land are
all in safety, although the horsemen of the Naya are
scouring the country in search of thee and thy companions.
In secret, word of thy consent to lead the
popular demonstration against oppression and ill-government
hath been conveyed to the people even to
our land's furthermost limits, and the reports from all
sides show that thou art regarded with favour."</p>

<p>"And thou art also one of my partisans&mdash;eh?" asked
Omar, smiling.</p>

<p>"I am, O Master," she answered blushing deeply.
"I will make fetish for the success of thine arms."</p>

<p>"I thank thee, Liola," he answered. "Thou hast
indeed brought us good tidings."</p>

<p>"But my father sendeth thee a further message," she
continued. "He told me to tell thee that at sundown to-day
he will come and conduct thee hence. Rest and
sleep until then, for the way may be long and great
vigilance may be demanded."</p>

<p>"Whither does he intend to take us?" our companion
asked.</p>

<p>"I know not, O Master," she replied. "Already the
people have armed, and are assembling. I heard my
father, in conversation last night with one of the provincial
governors who hath lately joined us, declare that
the struggle could not be much longer delayed."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a>[<a href="./images/196.png">196</a>]</span>
"Then thou meanest that a fight is imminent?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"I fear so. Word of thine intention hath been conveyed
by some spy unto the Naya, and the city now
swarmeth with her soldiers and janissaries, who have
orders to suppress the first sign of any insurrection.
But in the fight thou shalt assuredly win, for the opinion
of the people is in thy favour. May Zomara's jaws
close upon thine enemies, and may they be devoured like
sacrifices."</p>

<p>"The people are assembling, thou hast said," Omar
observed. "Are they in great numbers?"</p>

<p>"It is impossible to tell. The news of thine opposition
to the Naya spread like wildfire through the land,
and secret agents soon ascertained that the balance of
opinion was in thy favour. For eight days past I have
been at work secretly in thy cause, and from my own
observations in the city I know that among the palace
officials we have many adherents, and even here and
there the soldiers will turn against their own comrades.
In our own house arms and ammunition are stored, and
we have been fortunate enough in obtaining from the
arsenal through the governor, who is on our side, ten
of those wonderful guns of the English that fire bullets
like streams of water."</p>

<p>"Maxims, I suppose," I interrupted.</p>

<p>"I know not their name," she replied. "I heard my
father say that they are most deadly, and with them we
might hold an army at bay."</p>

<p>"Truly thy father hath neglected nothing on my
behalf," Omar said with sincerity. "Dost thou return
unto him?"</p>

<p>"I go at once."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a>[<a href="./images/197.png">197</a>]</span>
"Then tell him we are anxious to accompany him, and
will be ready at sundown."</p>

<p>"Thy words will I convey to him, O Master. Liola
shall make great fetish for thine ascent to the Emerald
Throne."</p>

<p>Then, wishing us adieu, the slim handsome girl with
the deep blue expressive eyes slipped out of the door,
and noiselessly crept away down the long stone corridor.</p>

<p>"Of a truth, O Master, there can be no fairer daughter
on earth than Liola," Kona observed, addressing Omar
when the pretty messenger had gone.</p>

<p>"Yea, she is beautiful. Her face is like the lily,
and her eyes as mysterious as the depths of the sea.
I have never encountered one so fair," Omar answered.</p>

<p>"Nor I," I said. "Her beauty is incomparable."</p>

<p>"I had no idea old Goliba had a daughter," Omar
exclaimed. "He is indeed fortunate to have one so
amazingly lovely."</p>

<p>"She is one of your partisans," I observed smiling.</p>

<p>And he laughed, while Kona, grinning with glee, declared
chaffingly that the Prince had fallen in love with her.</p>

<p>The subject, however, was not further pursued, but
now and then Omar would express a hope that she had
returned in safety to her father, or wonder why she
had been working in his cause, his words showing plainly
that his head was still filled with thoughts of our pretty
visitor.</p>

<p>Soon after the light had faded from the tiny chink
above, Goliba's voice was heard calling outside, and
we at once opened the door to him.</p>

<p>"Let us hasten, O Master," the old sage cried breathlessly.
"Every instant's delay meaneth peril, and peril
is first cousin to disaster."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"></a>[<a href="./images/198.png">198</a>]</span>
"Lead," I cried. "We will follow."</p>

<p>A moment later we all four were creeping softly
along the corridor past doors of the foul reeking
dungeons wherein those who for some cause or another,
often the most trivial, had fallen into disfavour with the
Naya and were rotting in their silent living tombs.
Many were the grim and fearful stories of injustice and
agony those black walls could tell; many were the victims
consigned there, although innocent of any offence, never
again to see the light of day. As we walked huge grey
rats, some the pets of the wretched prisoners, scurried
from our path, and now and then as we passed the small
closed door of heavy sheet-iron the groans and lamentations
of the unhappy captives reached our ears.</p>

<p>At last, after traversing many passages turning to right
and left in such a manner that the extent of the great
place amazed us, we ascended a flight of well-worn steps.</p>

<p>"The sentries now on guard are loyal to us," the royal
councillor whispered, turning to Omar as we went up,
and when we emerged into the chamber wherein stood
the Emerald Throne, the three tall soldiers with drawn
swords, two standing mute and motionless as statues on
either side of the door, and the other pacing up and
down, took no notice of our appearance, but regarded
us with stolid indifference. In the rosy evening light
we sped across the beautiful court to a gate opposite, and
passed out by a private way of which Goliba held the
key until we found ourselves beyond the frowning walls.</p>

<p>Kona looked around longingly as we passed through
the courts and chambers. He was anticipating with
eagerness the time when he and his men would re-enter
the place as conquerors, and was probably reflecting upon
the amount of loot his men could obtain in the event of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199"></a>[<a href="./images/199.png">199</a>]</span>
an order being given to sack the palace of the dreaded
Naya. But without pausing to glance behind, our guide
hurried us forward along a number of winding back
streets of the city, hot, dusty and close-smelling after
the broiling day, until he stopped before the door of a
fine house, the walls of which were of polished white
marble, that reflected the last rays of the sun like
burnished gold. Striking the door thrice, it opened,
and on going in he conducted us to a spacious hall,
where we found exposed to our view a great collection of
arms and warlike accoutrements. All kinds of instruments
of death, which the inventive malice of man had
ever discovered had been collected for the use of those
determined to accomplish the overthrow of the wicked
rule of the Naya. First, there were sticks, staves and
knotty clubs. Next to these, spears, darts, javelins,
armed with brass or iron, or their points hardened with
fire, and innumerable bows with quivers and arrows,
which Kona examined critically, giving low grunts of
approbation as he scrutinized a specimen of each.</p>

<p>After these, instruments of dubious use originally
designed for the assistance of man, but perverted
through cruelty and malice to the service of slaughter
and death; such as knives, scythes, axes and hammers.
On these were heaped arms, deliberately fashioned for the
offence of mankind, swords, daggers, poignards, scimitars,
and rapiers, while on the opposite side of the spacious
place were stored the more refined and destructive
instruments of European war, rifles, muskets, revolvers,
bayonets, small field-pieces, machine-guns of various
patterns, including four Maxims and their food, boxes
of cartridges, kegs of powder, cakes of dynamite,
bombs and shells.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200"></a>[<a href="./images/200.png">200</a>]</span>
"Behold!" exclaimed Goliba, halting before them.
"Here is one of our secret stores of arms."</p>

<p>"One of them!" said Omar. "How many, then,
have we?"</p>

<p>"In the city there are sixteen, all similarly filled.
Away in various parts of the country there are dep&ocirc;ts
in every populous centre," he replied.</p>

<p>"But it must have taken a long time to obtain all
these," the Prince observed, puzzled.</p>

<p>"The munitions of war were swiftly obtained for a
popular rising," the aged sage replied. "When the word
went forth in secret to the people, they responded almost
to a man. Arms were actually carried from the royal
arsenal in great quantities, and even the spies of the
Naya found themselves thwarted and powerless. We
have obtained nearly all the Maxims purchased in England,
by the Naya's agent, Makhana; some are here,
others at various dep&ocirc;ts, and each will be in charge of
fighting-men, who know their use. The few remaining
in the arsenal and forts have all been disabled by
those of our sympathisers in government employ."</p>

<p>"Truly," I said, turning to Omar, "the Naya who
gave an order for your assassination is seated on the
edge of a volcano."</p>

<p>"Yes," cried the white-bearded old councillor. "The
country hath struggled and groaned long and in vain
under the Naya's tyrannical sway; the uprising will be
swift and revengeful."</p>

<p>"When will it occur?" I asked, with eagerness.</p>

<p>"To-night," answered Goliba in a quiet tone.</p>

<p>"To-night?" we all three cried, amazed that the preparations
were already complete.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, in a low tone. "As the bell on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"></a>[<a href="./images/201.png">201</a>]</span>
palace-gate chimeth the midnight hour a great
mine will be fired that will proclaim with the earth's
sudden upheaval the rising of the people of Mo against
their ruler. Then the people, ready armed with these
weapons, will strike such a blow as will sweep away all
oppression and tyranny from our land, and leave it free
as it hath ever been, free to prosper and retain its
position as the only unconquered nation on the face of
earth."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI"></a>CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>

<h3>THE FIRST BLOW.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Leaving</span> the store of arms we returned to Goliba's house;
not by the high road, but by little winding lanes with
tunnel-like passages under the overhanging eaves of
houses; through a small open square or two, past a few
richly-painted and carved doors of tombs, and so on
once more to the residence of the old sage, with its
spacious courts and beautiful gardens. We passed some
handsome blue-tiled public fountains, and some fine
buildings several storeys in height, open in the centre
with a patio, and surrounded by galleries of carved wood,
which seemed to answer to our corn exchanges. One,
near Goliba's house, was especially remarkable for its
architectural beauty, not only with regard to its interior,
but also its magnificent gateway. There were others
also of far less pretensions, which answered more to
the caravanseri of Samory's country, where the weary
animals who had borne their burdens from some far
away corner of the mystic land were resting during their
sojourn in the city.</p>

<p>When, in the cool dusk of evening we had eaten in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"></a>[<a href="./images/202.png">202</a>]</span>
the marble court, with its fountains and flowering
plants, Omar being waited upon personally by our host,
Liola came, and, lounging gracefully against one of the
marble columns, gossipped with us. Afterwards, a professional
story-teller was introduced to amuse us during
the anxious time that must elapse before the fateful hour
when the signal for the great uprising would be given.</p>

<p>He was an old man, small of stature, in fact, I believe he
must have been one of the tribe of dwarf cave-dwellers.
Of darker complexion than the majority of this curious
people, he was dressed in a long garment of white,
wearing on his head a conical head-dress, shaped somewhat
like a dunce's cap, and as he took up his position,
squatting on a mat before us, he made deep obeisance to
the son of his ruler. While we regaled ourselves with
grapes and other luscious fruits as a satisfactory conclusion
to a bountiful feast, he told us a story which, as
far as I could translate it, was as follows:</p>

<p>"Ages ago," he said, "in the days of the good king
Lobenba and Prince Karmos"&mdash;here he kissed his hand
as a sign of reverence, as did all his listeners&mdash;"there
was a poor man, a cowherd, who lived a very righteous
life, nor did he commit any sin. But he was terribly
poor, starving because he had not the wherewithal to
supply himself with food. One night while asleep in his
lonely hut on the mountain over against the Grave of
Enemies, a vision appeared to him, and he saw standing
before him the god Zomara"&mdash;more hand-kissing&mdash;"in
a flame of fire. And the King of Crocodiles said to
him: 'Gogo, I have seen thy poverty and am come to
give thee succour. I have seen how, even in the days
when no food hath passed thy lips, thou hast never
committed theft, nor borrowed not to return, and now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203"></a>[<a href="./images/203.png">203</a>]</span>
thou shalt have great wealth. Speed early to-morrow to
thy friend Djerad and borrow his black horse. I will
put it in his mind to lend it thee; and take this horse
and ride it to the Gate of Mo, and then leap on thy
horse from the precipice, and assuredly thou wilt find
great wealth.'</p>

<p>"Ere Gogo had time to thank the great god&mdash;whose
name be exalted above all others&mdash;he had vanished.
Early he rose, donned his ragged garments, set forth and
begged the loan of the black horse of Djerad, his friend.
After a ride of many hours, he came at sundown to the
Gate of Mo, and gazed over the fearful precipice.
Gathering the reins in his hand he rode back a little
distance, then gallopped full speed to the brink. But his
heart failed him, and on the edge he reined his horse for
fear.</p>

<p>"Nine times he essayed to go, but each time his
courage was insufficient. While he was sitting on his
horse, preparing for the tenth time to obey the instructions,
he heard a great noise behind him, and turning,
saw the god Zomara with fire bursting from his
mouth and streams of light in his eyes, crawling towards
him.</p>

<p>"'Weak man,' he cried, as he passed. 'Thou fearest
to obey. Follow me.'</p>

<p>"An instant later the great crocodile had crawled over
the edge of the precipice, and a moment afterwards
Gogo had followed his example. It seemed as if he
were in the air an hour, but suddenly his horse's hoofs
touched earth again; the animal never fell into the
terrible abyss, but merely tore up a piece of the turf
where he had stood. He looked around; Zomara had
disappeared, but in the hole that the horse's hoof had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204"></a>[<a href="./images/204.png">204</a>]</span>
caused he saw a large ring of iron. Dismounting, he
tried to raise it, but only after two hours' work he
succeeded in moving it and excavating from its hiding-place
an enormous chest filled with gold pieces and
costly jewels, and so he lived in affluence the remainder
of his life, till Zomara took him to be one of his councillors.
So are the righteous rewarded."</p>

<p>Then some thick-lipped musicians struck up music on
quaintly-shaped stringed instruments, and the strange
old man, bearing a kind of tambourine in his hand,
came round to collect coins, the collection being repeated
at the conclusion of each legend.</p>

<p>In one of his stories mention was made in the most
matter-of-fact manner of a sick person being buried
alive. This caused me to address some questions to
Liola, who, seated near me, told me that this terrible
custom was one recently introduced by the Naya.</p>

<p>"The ghastly practice is supposed to appease Zomara
and give us victory over our enemies," she said. "As
soon as any serious illness setteth in, the patient is taken
from his house wrapped in his best robes, deposited in a
grave and then covered with earth. No one in Mo now
dieth a natural death. When the body hath been placed
in the grave, the friends of the dead man set forth to kill
the first living creature they can encounter, man, woman
or beast, believing that through their victim their friend
hath been compelled to die. When thus in search of an
expiatory victim, they take the precaution of breaking off
young shoots of the shrubs as they pass by, leaving the
broken ends hanging in the direction they are going as a
warning to people to shun that path. Even should one
of their own relatives be the first to meet the avengers
they dare not suffer him to escape."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205"></a>[<a href="./images/205.png">205</a>]</span>
"Life is not very secure in Mo when sickness rageth,"
I observed.</p>

<p>"No," she replied, sighing. "It is merely one of the
many horrible practices the Naya hath introduced into
our land. Whether a man is buried alive, or whether he
dieth in the fight, his kinsmen at once assemble and
destroy all his goods, saving only his vessels of gold
which are confiscated for the Naya's use. The curse of
Zomara would fall heavily upon anyone who attempteth
to make use of any article once owned by a dead person.
After the destruction of the property hath taken place
the house is filled with the fumes of burning resin. The
guests then sit in the perfumed atmosphere drinking
large draughts of fiery liquids and give vent to their
feelings in violent shouts."</p>

<p>"A strange custom, indeed," I said, astonished. "And
it is only of recent introduction?"</p>

<p>"When, three years ago the ancient Temple of Zomara
was discovered beneath the earth and all in Mo
descended to witness its wonders, the Naya gave orders
for the custom, as I have described, to be rigorously
observed," she answered, turning her clear, trusting eyes
upon Omar as she spoke.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards she left us in order to give some
orders to the slaves, and the story-teller and musicians
also departing, Goliba brought in three of the provincial
governors who had visited us on the last occasion we
had been the aged sage's guests, and together we discussed
and criticised for the last time the arrangements
made for the revolt. After an hour's consultation these
men again departed, and Goliba himself having brought
us our arms, consisting of an English-made magazine-rifle
each, some ammunition, and a short but very keen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"></a>[<a href="./images/206.png">206</a>]</span>
sword manufactured in Mo, left to make a tour of his house
to personally inspect the measures taken for its defence.</p>

<p>The next hour was so full of breathless excitement that
we dared only converse in whispers. The atmosphere
was hot and oppressive, the sky had grown dark and
overcast, threatening ominously, while ever and anon
could be heard the faint clank of arms; men, tall, dark
and mysterious, passed and repassed along the dark
colonnades, or stood in knots leaning on their rifles discussing
the situation in undertones.</p>

<p>On returning to us our host told us that the store of
arms we had seen, as well as others in various neighbourhoods,
had all been distributed, and that the whole city
was awaiting the signal.</p>

<p>"Roughly speaking, thou hast in the capital alone
thirty thousand adherents," the councillor said to Omar.
"Thou hast therefore nothing to fear. The path to
victory is straight, and little danger lurketh there."</p>

<p>Almost ere these words had fallen from his lips, loud
shouting sounded at the door that gave entrance to the
patio wherein we stood, and we were startled to notice
a scuffle taking place between a number of those who
were about to guard the house and some would-be
intruders. Yet ere we could realise the true state of
affairs, we saw dozens of the royal soldiers scrambling
down from the walls on every side, rifles flashed here and
there, and within a few moments the place was in possession
of the troops of the Naya.</p>

<p>"We seek Omar, the prince, and his companions,"
cried a man in a shining golden breastplate, evidently
an officer of high rank, striding up to Goliba. "We
hold orders from the Naya to capture them, and take
them to the palace. We know thou hast harboured them."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"></a>[<a href="./images/207.png">207</a>]</span>
Before our host could reply twenty of the fighting-men
of Mo, having recognized us, dashed across, and
notwithstanding our resistance, had seized us. Goliba,
too, was quickly made prisoner, and above the shouting
and hoarse imprecations we heard in the darkness a loud
piercing woman's scream.</p>

<p>Liola had also fallen into their hands!</p>

<p>We fought our captors with all the strength of which
we were capable, but were unarmed, for on receiving the
rifles and swords from Goliba we had placed them
together at a little distance away in a corner of the
court. It took fully a dozen stalwart soldiers to hold
the black giant Kona, and even then it was as much as
they could do to prevent him from severely mauling them.
His grip was like a vice; his fist hard as iron.</p>

<p>In the hands of three of these white robed soldiers,
who had on our arrival in Mo cheered and belauded us,
I struggled fiercely, but to no avail, for they dragged us
all onward across the patio and out into the street, now
crowded by those attracted by the unusual disturbance
in the house of the Naya's councillor. The huge grim
gateway of the royal palace stood facing the end of the
long, broad thoroughfare, and from where we stood we
had an uninterrupted view of it. Our arrest was indeed
a disaster when we seemed within an ace of success.
The people regarded us indifferently as we were hurried
up the hill towards the great stone arch with its massive
watch-towers, and it appeared as though the swift
decisive step of securing the ringleaders of the revolt
had entirely crushed it, for the people, instead of
showing defiance, shrank back from the soldiers, cowed
and submissive.</p>

<p>Suddenly, as we went forward, the great bell in one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208"></a>[<a href="./images/208.png">208</a>]</span>
of the high turrets of the Naya's stronghold boomed
forth the first stroke of the midnight hour.</p>

<p>Then, in an instant, a bright red flash blinded us,
followed by a report so deafening, that the very rock
whereon the city was built trembled, and we saw amid
the dense smoke before us the great black gateway, with
its watch towers where the sentries were pacing, break
away, and shoot in huge masses high towards the sky.</p>

<p>The explosion was terrific; its effect appalling. The
glare lit the whole city for a brief second with a light
like a stormy sunset, then upon us showered great pieces
of iron and stone with mangled human limbs, the <i>d&eacute;bris</i>
of a gateway that for centuries had been considered
absolutely impregnable.</p>

<p>The first blow against tyranny and oppression had
been struck, terrible and decisive. It was the people's
call to arms. Would they respond?</p>



<hr class="full" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII"></a>CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>

<h3>BY THE NAYA'S ORDERS.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">A short</span> time only did we remain in doubt as to the
intention of the populace. The suppressed excitement
found vent even before the clouds of choking smoke
had rolled away. The signal had been given, and
instantly they responded with fierce yells, throwing
themselves suddenly upon the soldiers, using weapons
that seemed to have been produced like magic.</p>

<p>Those who had effected our capture, dumbfounded,
first by the appalling explosion, and then by the hostile
attitude of the people, released us instantly, being compelled
to fight for their lives back towards the smoking
ruins of the palace-gate.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"></a>[<a href="./images/209.png">209</a>]</span>
Within a few moments the great broad thoroughfare,
with its handsome houses, became the scene of a most
fierce and sanguinary conflict. Rifles flashed everywhere,
in the street, from the windows and roofs of
surrounding buildings, pouring a fire upon the soldiers
so deadly that few succeeded in escaping back to the
place whence they came. With startling suddenness I
found myself in the midst of this stirring scene, fighting
for life beside Omar. Both of us had snatched rifles
and ammunition from fallen soldiers, while someone in
the crowd had given me a fine sword with bejewelled
hilt, which I hastily buckled on in case of emergency.
Behind us a great barricade was being built of the first
things that came to hand. The houses were being
divested of their furniture by a hundred busy hands,
and this, piled high, with spaces here and there for
the guns, soon presented a barrier formidable, almost
insurmountable. The erection of barricades was, we
afterwards found, part of the scheme, for in all the
principal thoroughfares similar piles were constructed,
each being manned by a sturdy body of men, well-armed
and determined to hold in check and repulse the attack
which they knew would, ere long, be made upon them by
the military.</p>

<p>The forces of Mo, feared on every hand for their
daring and brilliant feats were, we knew, not to be trifled
with, and as word had been secretly conveyed to Omar
that the Naya, on hearing of the intention of the people,
had ordered her soldiers to institute an indiscriminate
massacre, we should have to fight hard to save our lives.</p>

<p>The barricade was soon completed, and quickly word
spread from mouth to mouth to get behind it. This
we all did, to the number of about three thousand; then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210"></a>[<a href="./images/210.png">210</a>]</span>
came a period of waiting. It was not our object to
renew the attack, but to await reprisals. Apparently,
however, the blowing up of the palace-gate had utterly
disconcerted the royal troops whose barracks were in
that vicinity, and we could see by the crowd of moving
torches that the soldiers were engaged in repairing the
huge breach made in the walls before marching forth to
quell the insurrection.</p>

<p>In the darkness we waited patiently. A few desultory
shots, fired by some of our more adventurous partisans,
who, climbing to the top of the barricade, aimed
where they saw the torches moving, broke the ominous
silence, but in distant parts of the city we could hear
the rapid firing of musketry, with now and then a loud
thundering roar when a heavy field-piece was discharged.</p>

<p>Each moment seemed an hour as we remained inactive
behind that improvised barrier of doors, shutters,
furniture, iron gates and railings. Omar and I were
standing together beside one of the three Maxim guns
by which our position was defended, watching the
preparations being made on the top of the hill for
assaulting us, when suddenly there was a bright flash,
and next instant a great shell fell behind us, bursting
and dealing death and destruction among our ranks.
The air became rent by the shrill cries of the wounded
and the hoarse agonized exclamations of the dying, for
this first shot from the palace had been terribly effective,
and fully fifty of those anxious to bear their part in the
struggle for liberty had been killed, while many others
were wounded. The shell had unfortunately fallen right
in the centre of the crowd.</p>

<p>Again another was discharged, but it whistled over
our heads and exploded far away behind us, shattering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"></a>[<a href="./images/211.png">211</a>]</span>
several houses, but injuring nobody. A third and a
fourth were sent at us, but neither were so effective as
the first. The breach in the wall where the gate had
once been had now been repaired, and the adherents of
the Great White Queen were at last taking the offensive.</p>

<p>Both Omar and myself had earlier that day, during
our visit to the store of arms, been instructed in the use
of that terror of modern warfare, the Maxim gun, and
the one against which we stood with two men had been
allotted to us.</p>

<p>My companion, who had been watching with the
deadly weapon ready sighted to sweep the street, turned
to ask news of Liola, whom we had not seen since we
were dragged from her father's house, and I had taken
his place, my hand ready to fire. Of Liola's fate I
feared the worst. She had been taken prisoner, and
had probably been killed or injured in the fierce <i>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</i>.</p>

<p>Suddenly with wild yells, several hundred of the
Naya's horsemen dashed down the hill, their swords
whirling, followed by a huge force of men mounted and
dismounted. I saw that at last they had come forth for
the attack, and without a second's hesitation bent and
commenced a fire, the terrible rattling of which held me
appalled. The guns on either side followed mine in
chorus, and almost momentarily we were pouring out
such a hail of bullets, that amid the smoke and fire the
great body of horses and troops were mowed down like
grass before the scythe. The foremost in the cavalry
ranks had no time to lift their carbines to reply, ere
they were swept into eternity, and those coming behind,
although making a desperate stand, fell riddled by
bullets from our three terrible engines of destruction.</p>

<p>The fight with Samory's fugitives on the Way of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212"></a>[<a href="./images/212.png">212</a>]</span>
Thousand Steps had been exciting enough, but in extent
or bloodshed was not to be compared with this. In
that single onward rush of the Naya's troops hundreds
were killed, for, ceasing our fire for a moment or two
while the smoke cleared, we saw, lying in the street, great
piles of men and horses, who had fallen upon one another
in their forward dash and died under our frightful hail
of lead.</p>

<p>A short pause, and the rifles and all the chorus of
surrounding artillery took up their thunder-song with
increased energy. These works of man outrivalled the
natural elements by their tremendous booming and their
disastrous power. Shells from the palace walls fell
upon us thick and fast. No lightning's flash can
accomplish such ruin as the modern ordnance projectile<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: added missing period">.</ins>
A few centuries back the thought would have been
incomprehensible; even so the visionary and ridiculed
idea of to-day may be realised in the future. The shots
descended, a veritable storm of lead, and several times
the clouds of choking dust they set up enveloped us; but
we were undaunted, and continued to work the Maxim,
spreading its death-dealing rain up the broad thoroughfare
and preventing any from reaching our barricade.</p>

<p>The idea of the troops was no doubt to gradually
force us back from the external positions of the city
into the central, and from the centre to the east in the
direction of the gate that gave access to the country.
By this means the fighting area would be compressed,
and we should be surrounded by a large body of our
enemies who had massed outside the gate to cut off our
retreat. But the thundering boom of cannon and sharp
rattle of musketry on our right, showed that our comrades,
barricaded in a great thoroughfare running parallel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213"></a>[<a href="./images/213.png">213</a>]</span>
with the one wherein we were, had also set to work to
repel their enemy.</p>

<p>Barricades had sprung up in all directions like magic.
The four corners of intersecting streets were the positions
mostly chosen for them, and every conceivable article
was used in their construction. Women and children
vied with the men in activity and resourcefulness in the
erection of these improvised works of defence, and the
work slackened not even when shells and bullets fell
about in dangerous proximity.</p>

<p>Our companions, the partisans of Omar to whom they
looked to deliver their country from the thraldom of
tyranny, were fortunately not devoid of those soldier-like
qualities which in past ages had raised the military
renown of Mo to the greatest altitude; what they lacked
mostly outside of themselves were capable officering and
generalship. There were a few officers of the royal
army among them, men who had become convinced
that a change of government was necessary, but the
people were left to do battle mainly on the principle of
individual enterprise.</p>

<p>Time after time attacks, each increasing in strength
and proving more disastrous to us than the first, were
made upon us. But our Maxims kept up their rattle,
and from every part of the great wall of paving stones,
furniture, trees and heaped-up miscellaneous articles,
there poured out volley after volley from bristling rifles.</p>

<p>The troops quickly found the street absolutely
untenable, for each time they made a rush to storm our
position they were compelled to fall back, and few indeed
reached a place of safety amid our deadly fire.
When we had held the barricade for nearly an hour,
Kona, Omar and myself being close together bearing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214"></a>[<a href="./images/214.png">214</a>]</span>
our part in repulsing our opponents, a loud roar suddenly
sounded before us and at the same instant a huge
shell, imbedding itself in our defences, exploded with a
bright light and deafening report.</p>

<p>The havoc caused was appalling. Half our barricade
was blown completely away, and besides killing and
maiming dozens of our comrades, it shattered several
houses close by, and its force sent me down flat upon
my back. Instantly I struggled to my feet, and finding
myself uninjured save for a severe laceration of the
hand, glanced round seeking my two friends. But they
were not there!</p>

<p>The shell had set part of the barricade on fire, and
already the flames were rising high, lighting up the
terrible, lurid scene. Again I bent to my Maxim and
recommenced firing, but as I did so another shell, only
too well directed, struck the opposite end of our
defences, and instantly a disaster resulted similar to the
first, while a house at the same moment fell with a
terrible crash, burying several unfortunate fellows beneath
its <i>d&eacute;bris</i>.</p>

<p>Instantly I saw that our defences were partially demolished,
and as shell after shell fell in rapid succession
in our vicinity and exploded, our gallant defenders, still
determined to prove victors, rushed up the hill to try
conclusions with the Naya's troops. It was a wild, mad
dash, and I found myself carried forward in the onrush
of several thousand excited men. Meeting the remnant
of the cavalry we fought with savage ferocity, alternately
being beaten and beating. I had lost Omar,
Kona and Goliba, half fearing that they had been blown
to atoms by the shell, nevertheless the courage of my comrades
never failed, although gaining the top of the hill<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215"></a>[<a href="./images/215.png">215</a>]</span>
and defeating the cavalry by sheer force of numbers,
they were driven back again at the point of the bayonet,
while from the ruins of the palace-gate a steady rifle
fire was poured upon us at the same time.</p>

<p>Half-way down the hill we made a gallant stand, but
again were compelled to fall back in disorder. Soon we
were driven from the main thoroughfare into the minor
streets, refuging in and fighting from the houses, whilst
our foe steadily and angrily pursued and closed in upon
us, dislodging us from our shelters and leaving few loop-holes
for escape.</p>

<p>The carnage was awful; quarter was refused. It
seemed as though our hope was a forlorn one; the
general and ruthless massacre ordered by the Great
White Queen had actually begun!</p>

<p>The loss of our barricade paralysed us. Yet we
could hear the roar and tumult, and seeing the reflection
of fires in other parts of the city, only hoped that our
comrades there were holding their own valiantly as we
had struggled to do. Ever and anon loud explosions
sounded above the thunder of artillery, and it became
apparent that the royal troops were engaged in blowing
up any defences they could not take by assault.</p>

<p>From where I had sought shelter behind a high wall
with a lattice window through which I continually discharged
my rifle into the roadway, I saw massacres within
walls and without. The troops had poured down upon
us in absolutely overwhelming numbers, and no resistance
by our weakened force could now save us. One fact
alone reassured me and gave me courage. In the bright red
glare shed by the flames from a burning building, among
a party who made a sally from the opposite house I
caught a momentary glance of the lithe, active figure of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216"></a>[<a href="./images/216.png">216</a>]</span>
Omar, fighting desperately against a body of the Naya's
infantry and leading on his comrades with loud shouts
of encouragement.</p>

<p>"Do your duty, men!" he gasped. "Let not your
enemies crush you!"</p>

<p>But the <i>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</i> was awful. Once again our partisans
were driven back, and the street was strewn with
bodies in frightful array, left where they fell, uncovered,
unattended.</p>

<p>The thick black cloud of smoke which hung over the
City in the Clouds and on either side of it obscured
the rising dawn and intensified the horrors of the awful
drama. Fires raged in every direction, making the air
hot; it was close through the smoke cloud above and
the absence of wind, f&oelig;tid with the odour of human
blood that lay in pools in every street and splashed
upon the houses. The sight was majestic, terrible,
never-to-be-forgotten; in the midst of it the terror and
stupefaction were almost beyond human endurance. On
all sides were heard the roar of flames, the breaking
of timbers and the crashing in of roofs and walls. Fire
and sword reigned throughout the magnificent capital of
Mo; its people were being swept into eternity with a
relentless brutality that was absolutely fiendish.</p>

<p>Into the hearts of the survivors of the gallant force
who had so readily constructed our barricade and so
valiantly defended it, despair had entered. There was
now no hope for the success of our cause. The forces
of tyranny, oppression and misrule were fast proving
the victors, and in that fearful indiscriminate shooting
down of men, women and children that was proceeding,
all knew that sooner or later they must fall victims.</p>

<p>I had seen nothing of Kona or Goliba since the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217"></a>[<a href="./images/217.png">217</a>]</span>
wrecking of our barricade, but Omar, I was gratified to
observe, was stationed at a window of the opposite
house from which he directed well-aimed shots at those
below. A body of fully five hundred infantry were besieging
the house wherein a large number of our comrades
had taken shelter, determined to put them to the
sword; yet so desperate was the resistance that they found
it impossible to enter, and many were killed in their
futile endeavours. At length I noticed that while the
main body covered the movements of several of their
companions the latter were preparing a mine by which
to blow it up. With the half-dozen men beside me we
kept up a galling fire upon them, but all in vain. The
mine was laid; only a spark was required to blow the
place into the air.</p>

<p>Knowing that if such a catastrophe were accomplished
we, too, must suffer being in such close proximity to it,
we waited breathlessly, unable to escape from the vicinity
of the deadly spot.</p>

<p>Suddenly, as one man, more fearless than the others,
bent to fire the mine, the soldiers, with one accord,
rushed back, and scarce daring to breathe I waited,
fearing each second to see the house and its garrison
shattered to fragments and myself receive the full force
of the explosive.</p>

<p>But at that instant, even as I watched, a loud
exultant shout broke upon my ear, and looking I saw
approaching from the opposite end of the street a great
crowd of people rushing forward, firing rapidly as they
came.</p>

<p>They were our comrades. Their shouts were shouts
of victory!</p>

<p>"Kill them!" they cried. "Let not one escape.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218"></a>[<a href="./images/218.png">218</a>]</span>
They have killed our brothers; let us have revenge!
The Naya shall die, and Omar shall be our Naba!"</p>

<p>The man bending over the explosive sprang back in
fear without having applied the fatal spark, and his
companions, taken thus completely by surprise, stood
amazed at this sudden appearance of so large a body of
the populace. But the rifles of the latter in a few
seconds had laid low several of their number, and then,
making a stand, they lowered their weapons. A loud
word of command sounded, and as if from one weapon
a volley was fired full upon the victorious people. For
a few moments its deadly effect checked their progress,
but an instant later they resumed their onward rush, and
ere a second volley could be fired they had flung themselves
upon their opponents, killing them with bayonet,
sword and pistol.</p>

<p>Their rush was in too great a force to be withstood.
As in other parts of the city, so here, they compelled
the troops to fly before them, and shot them down as
they sped back up the hill towards the great stronghold.</p>

<p>In those few fateful minutes the tables had suddenly
been turned. While we, fighting hard in that hot corner,
had imagined that we had lost, our comrades in other
parts of the city had won a magnificent victory, and had
come to our rescue at the eleventh hour.</p>

<p>Truly it was everywhere a fierce and bloody fight.</p>



<hr class="full" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII"></a>CHAPTER XXVIII.</h2>

<h3>THE FIGHT FOR THE EMERALD THRONE.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Thrown</span> into utter confusion by the great press of people
well armed and determined, the soldiers, who had fought
so desperately, and who intended to blow up the house<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219"></a>[<a href="./images/219.png">219</a>]</span>
that Omar and his companions had made their stronghold,
fled precipitately up the hill, but so rapid and heavy
was the firing, that few, if any, got out of the street alive.</p>

<p>On seeing the chances thus suddenly turned in our
favour we poured forth into the street again, and joining
our forces with those of our rescuers, rushed with them into
the main thoroughfare leading to the palace, scrambling
over the <i>d&eacute;bris</i> of our barricade and the heaps of bodies
that blocked our passage. A hurried question, addressed
to a man rushing along at my side, elicited glad tidings.
So fiercely had the people fought that the troops sent
out to quell the rising had been utterly routed everywhere,
while many of the regiments had turned in our
favour and had actually held several of the barricades,
winning brilliant victories.</p>

<p>"It is yonder, at the palace, where the resistance will
be greatest," the man cried excitedly, blood streaming
from a ghastly wound on his brow. "But our cause is
good. The Naya shall die!"</p>

<p>"To the Palace!" screamed the infuriated mob.
"To the Palace!"</p>

<p>And forward the frantic dash was made at redoubled
pace until we came to the pile of fallen masonry,
which had, a few hours ago, been the great impregnable
gateway that closed each day at sunset, and opened not
till sunrise, save for the Great White Queen herself.</p>

<p>Here the place seemed undefended until we came
close up to it, when without warning we were met with a
withering rifle fire that laid low dozens of our comrades.
The man who had been so enthusiastic a moment before
and who had told me of our successes, was struck full in
the breast by a ball and fell against me dead.</p>

<p>For a moment only did we hold back. Dawn was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220"></a>[<a href="./images/220.png">220</a>]</span>
spreading now, but the heavy black smoke obscured the
struggling daylight. Suddenly there sounded just at my
rear Omar's well-known voice, crying:</p>

<p>"Forward! Forward, my brethren. I, Omar, your
prince, lead you into the palace of my father. To-day
there commenceth a new and brighter era for our
beloved land. Falter not, but end the struggle valiantly
as ye have commenced it. Forward!"</p>

<p>His words sent a sudden patriotic thrill through the
great concourse of armed men, who instantly sprang
forward, and regardless of the blazing lines of rifles before
them climbed the ruins and engaged the defenders hand
to hand. It was a brilliant dash and could only have
been accomplished by the courage inspired by Omar's
words, for the odds were once more against us, and the
rapid fire from behind the ruins played the most
frightful havoc in our ranks. In the midst of the crowd
I clambered up, sword in hand, over the huge masses of
masonry and rubbish, and springing to earth on the other
side, alighted in a corner where the picked guards of the
Naya were making a last desperate stand.</p>

<p>At first the struggle had been a hand-to-hand one, but
they had retreated, and were now firing heavy volleys
that effectively kept us at bay.</p>

<p>Almost at the same moment as I sprang down I heard
behind me fiendish yells and the clambering of many
feet. In an instant I recognised it as the savage war
cry of the Dagombas, and next second a hundred half-naked
blacks, looking veritable fiends in the red glare,
swept down headlong to the spot where I stood and,
headed by Kona brandishing his spear, dashed straight
upon the defenders. The effect of this was to cause
the others to spring forward as reinforcements, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221"></a>[<a href="./images/221.png">221</a>]</span>
quicker than the time occupied in relating it, this
position, an exceedingly strong one, fell into our hands.
So infuriated were the Dagombas by the excesses committed
by the soldiery in various parts of the city, that
they vented their savage wrath upon the defenders until
the butchery became awful, and I doubt whether a single
man escaped.</p>

<p>The soldiers holding the next court, seeing this
disaster, placed, ere we could prevent them, two field-pieces
behind the closed gate wherein holes had been
hacked, and with the walls crowded with men with
rifles they began to pour upon us a deadly hail of shot
and shell. Once, for a moment only, Niaro, the provincial
governor I had met at Goliba's, fought beside me,
but after exchanging a few breathless words we became
again separated. Little time elapsed ere one and all
understood that to remain long under this galling fire of
the palace guards would mean death to us, therefore it
required no further incentive than an appeal from Omar
to cause us to storm the entrance to the court.</p>

<p>"Well done, friends," he shouted. "We have broken
down the first defence. Come, let us sweep away the
remainder, but spare the life of the Naya. Remember I
am her son. Again, forward! Zomara giveth strength
to your hands and courage to your hearts. Use them for
the purpose he hath bestowed them upon you."</p>

<p>In the forward movement in response to these loudly-uttered
words fearful cries of rage and despair mingled
with hoarse shouts of the vanquished. Rifles flashed
everywhere in the faint morning light, bullets kept up a
singing chorus above our heads, and about me, in the
frightful tumult, gleamed naked blood-stained blades.
At first the guards, like those in the outer court, made a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222"></a>[<a href="./images/222.png">222</a>]</span>
desperate resistance, but soon they showed signs of weakness,
and I could distinguish in the faint grey dawn how
gradually we were driving them back, slowly gaining the
entrance to the court, which, I remembered, was a very
large and beautiful one with cool colonnades, handsome
fountains and beautiful flowering trees of a kind I had
never seen in England.</p>

<p>At last, after a fierce struggle, in which the defenders
very nearly succeeded in driving us out or slaughtering
us where we stood, the field-pieces were silenced, a charge
of explosive was successfully placed beneath the gate and
a loud roar followed that shook every stone in that
colossal pile.</p>

<p>The ponderous door was shattered and the defenders
disorganised by the suddenness of the disaster. Almost
before they were aware of it we had poured in among
them. Then the slaughter was renewed, and the scenes
witnessed on every hand frightful to behold.</p>

<p>Kona and his black followers fought like demons,
spearing the soldiers right and left, always in the van of
the fray. Omar and Kona were apparently sharing the
direction of the attack, for sometimes I heard the voice
of one raised, giving orders, and sometimes the other.
But, however irregular the mode of proceeding might
have been from a military standpoint, success was ours,
for half an hour later the two inner courts, strenuously
defended by the Naya's body guard, were taken, and
judging from the fact that the firing outside had become
desultory it seemed as though hostilities in the streets
had practically ceased.</p>

<p>At this juncture some man, a tall, powerful fellow who
was distinguishing himself by his valiant deeds, told me
that the military down in the city, finding the populace so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223"></a>[<a href="./images/223.png">223</a>]</span>
strong, had, after a most terrific fight, at last ceased all
opposition and declared in favour of the Prince Omar.
This, we afterwards discovered, was the actual truth.
The carnage in the streets had, however, been appalling,
before this step had been resolved upon, but when once
the declaration had been made, the remnants of the
Naya's army were, at the orders of the leaders of the
people, marched without the city wall on the opposite
side to the great cliff, and there halted to await the
progress of events.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, we were still hewing our way, inch by
inch, towards the centre of the palace of the Great
White Queen. So desperate was the conflict that the
perspiration rolled from us in great beads, and many of
my comrades fell from sheer exhaustion, and were
trampled to death beneath the feet of the wildly-excited
throng.</p>

<p>Soon, driving back the final ring of defenders, and
shooting them down to the last man, we dashed across
the central court, where the polished marble paving
ran with blood, and battering down the great gilded
doors, that fell with a loud crash, gained our goal,
entering the spacious Hall of Audience, in the
centre of which, upon its raised da&iuml;s, under the great
gilded dome, stood the historic Emerald Throne.</p>

<p>The magnificent hall was deserted. The bloodshed
had been frightful. The courts were heaped with dead
and dying. Several chairs were lying overturned, as
if the courtiers and slaves had left hastily, and even
across the seat of royalty one of the Naya's rich bejewelled
robes of state had been hastily flung down.
This, snatched up by one of the Dagombas, was tossed
away into the crowd, who gleefully tore it to shreds as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224"></a>[<a href="./images/224.png">224</a>]</span>
sign that the power of the dreaded Naya was for ever
broken.</p>

<p>To the exultant shouts of a thousand wild, blood-bespattered
people, the great hall echoed again and again.
The faint light showed too plainly at what terrible cost
the victory had been won. Their clothes were torn, their
faces were blackened by powder, from their superficial
wounds blood was oozing, while the more serious consequences
of sword-cuts and gun-shots had been hastily
bound by shreds of garments. Flushed by their
victory, they were a strange, forbidding-looking rabble.
Yet they were our partisans; a peaceful, law-abiding
people who had been oppressed by a tyrannical rule and
long ripe for revolt, they had seized this opportunity to
break the power of the cruel-hearted woman who was
unworthy to hold sway upon that historic throne.</p>

<p>"Let us seek the Naya! She shall not escape! Let
us avenge the deaths of our fathers and children!"
were the cries raised when they found the Hall of
Audience deserted. Apparently they had expected to
find the Great White Queen seated there, awaiting them,
and their chagrin was intense at finding her already a
fugitive.</p>

<p>"She dare not face us!" they screamed. "All tyrants
are cowards. Kill her! Let us kill her!"</p>

<p>But Goliba, whom I was gratified to see present
and unharmed, sprang upon the da&iuml;s, and waving his
arms, cried:</p>

<p>"Rather let us first place our valiant young prince
upon the Emerald Throne. Let him be appointed our
ruler; then let us seek to place the Naya in captivity."</p>

<p>"No," they cried excitedly. "Kill her!"</p>

<p>"Give her alive to Zomara!" suggested one man near<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225"></a>[<a href="./images/225.png">225</a>]</span>
me, grimly. "Let her taste the punishment to which
she has consigned so many hundreds of our relatives
and friends."</p>

<p>Heedless of these shouts, Goliba, stretching forth his
hand, led Omar, whose torn clothes and perspiring face
told how hard he had fought, towards the wonderful
throne of green gems, and seating him thereon, cried:</p>

<p>"I, Goliba, on behalf of these, the people of our
great kingdom, enthrone thee and invest thee with the
supreme power in place of thy mother, the Naya."</p>

<p>Loud deafening cheers, long repeated, rose from the
assembled multitude, and the soldiers dying in the courts
outside knew that the revolt of the people had been
successful; that right had won in this struggle against
might. Then, when the cries of adulation became
fainter, and with difficulty silence was restored, Omar
rose, and raising his sword, upon which blood was still
wet, exclaimed in a loud, ringing voice:</p>

<p>"I, Omar, the last descendant of the royal house of
Sanom, hereby proclaim myself Naba of Mo."</p>

<p>Again cheers rang through the vaulted hall, and
presently, when the excitement had once more died
down, he added, gazing round with a regal air:</p>

<p>"About me here I see those who have borne arms in my
cause, and to each and every one I render thanks.
How much we may all of us deplore the loss of so many
valuable lives death is nevertheless the inevitable result
of any recourse to arms. At least, we have the satisfaction
of knowing that our cause was a just one, and
by the sacred memory of our ancestors I swear that my
rule shall be devoid of that cruelty and tyranny that
have disgraced the later pages of my beloved country's
history. I, Omar, am your ruler; ye are my people.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226"></a>[<a href="./images/226.png">226</a>]</span>
Obey the laws we promulgate and the good counsels of
our advisers, and security both of life and property
shall be yours. From this moment human sacrifices to
our great god Zomara&mdash;to whom all praise be given
for this victory of our arms&mdash;are abolished. But our
first and foremost word from this, our seat of royalty, is
that the life of the Naya shall be spared. Your Naba
hath spoken."</p>

<p>A visible look of disappointment overspread the countenances
of those around me. All had, in their wild enthusiasm,
desired to wreak their vengeance upon the unjust
queen, but this royal decree forbade it. There even
went forth murmurs of disapproval, and Omar, hearing
them, said in a loud, serious voice:</p>

<p>"A Sanom hath never allowed his kinsman to be
murdered, therefore although the Naya hath plotted to
take my life, she shall be held captive, and not die. Let
not a hair of her head be touched, or he who lifteth his
hand against her shall be brought before me, and I will
not spare him. Enough blood hath been already shed
since the going down of the sun; let not another life be
wasted."</p>

<p>Then calling Goliba, Kona, Niaro, and myself up to
his side upon the royal da&iuml;s, he continued:</p>

<p>"These, my friends, who have assisted me to gain this,
my kingdom, are deserving of reward, and this shall at
once be given them. Goliba, whom all know as a sage
and upright man&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Cheers, long and ringing, here interrupted his words.
When quiet had been restored he continued:</p>

<p>"Goliba shall retain his position as chief of our royal
councillors, and shall be also Grand Vizier of Mo.
Niaro, a trusty governor to whom all who have appealed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227"></a>[<a href="./images/227.png">227</a>]</span>
have met with justice, is appointed Custodian of the
Gate of Mo, in place of Babila, for whom we all mourn.
To Kona, head man of the Dagombas of the forest, I
owe my life, and he shall be chief of our army and of our
body-guard, and his native followers shall themselves be
the principal members of the guard. And Scarsmere,"
he said, turning towards me<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: superfluous quotation mark removed">,</ins> "Scarsmere hath been my
friend and companion across the great black water; he
knoweth not fear, for together we have been held by
Samory and Prempeh, and have yet managed to preserve
our lives. Since I, your Naba, left Mo by the Way of
the Thousand Steps, and entered the land of the white
men, Scarsmere hath been my friend and companion,
therefore all shall treat him with due respect, for although
he cometh from the wonderful land afar he shall be
Governor of this our city and Keeper of our Treasure-house.
He is the trusted and faithful friend of
your Naba, and all shall regard him as highest in
favour."</p>

<p>"We greet thee, Goliba!" enthusiastically cried the
surging crowd. "We greet thee, Niaro, Custodian of
the Gate! We greet thee, Kona, a savage but great
chieftain! Thou art head of our army! We greet thee,
Scarsmere, the friend of our royal Naba, and Governor of
Mo! We, the people, accept you, and have confidence
in your rule. Ye are all great, and are worthy of the
offices to which ye have been raised. May your names
be exalted above all others, and your faces be as beacons
unto us!"</p>

<p>And they shouted themselves hoarse in cheering, seeing
in the enthronement of the young Naba the dawn of a
just and beneficent rule. Their adulations became
louder, and even more profuse, when Omar proceeded to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228"></a>[<a href="./images/228.png">228</a>]</span>
appoint others, well known and popular, to various offices
connected with the palace.</p>

<p>"Happy," cried the white-bearded sages who had
taken their places behind the throne&mdash;"happy is the
prince whose trust is in Zomara and whose wisdom
cometh from the King of the River."</p>

<p>"Happy," cried the people, humbling themselves&mdash;"happy
is our Naba, the favourite of the Crocodile-god,
the one from whose wrath all flee."</p>

<p>"That," replied Omar, "O people, is too much even
for the Naba of Mo to hear. But may Zomara approve
of my thoughts and actions! So shall the infernal
powers destroy the wretches that employ them, and the
arrows recoil upon those who draw a bow upon us. But,
O sages, though your numbers are reduced your integrity
is more tried and approved; therefore let Omar, your
Naba, partake of the sweetness of your counsels and learn
from aged experience the wisdom of the sons of earth.
Ye shall tell me from time to time what the peace and
sincerity of my throne requireth from me, for human
prudence alone is far too weak to fight against the wiles
of the deceitful."</p>

<p>I stood beside the royal seat, deep in thought, silently
gazing upon the thousand upturned, grimy faces. It
had indeed been a curious turn of events that had conspired
to place my friend upon the throne of an autocrat,
and also to give, into my own unaccustomed hands, the
rule and control of this most magnificent and extensive
capital, and all the wondrous treasures of the royal house
of the Sanoms.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX"></a>CHAPTER XXIX.</h2>

<h3>A MYSTERY.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">From</span> the glittering Hall of Audience a forward movement
was soon made to the inner rooms that formed the
private apartments of the Naya. Carried onward by the
press of people, I was amazed at the magnificence and
luxury everywhere apparent. The walls were mostly of
polished marble inlaid with gold and adorned with
frescoes, the ceilings ornamented with strange allegorical
paintings, and the floors of jasper and alabaster. But as
the irate crowd dashed onward through the great tenantless
chambers they tore down the rich silk hangings and
trod them underfoot, broke up the tiny gold-inlaid
tables, and out of sheer wantonness hacked the soft
divans with their swords.</p>

<p>The discovery that the Naya had fled increased the
indignation of the mob, and were it not for the urgent
appeal of Kona, who had at once assumed the commandership,
the whole of the magnificent rooms would
no doubt have been wrecked. As it was, however, the
good counsels of the Dagomba head-man prevailed, and
wanton hands were stayed from committing more serious
excesses.</p>

<p>Whither the Great White Queen had fled no one
knew. To every nook and corner search parties penetrated;
even the sleeping apartment, with its massive bed
of ivory and hangings of purple, gold-embroidered satin,
was not held sacred. Yet nowhere could the once-dreaded
ruler be discovered. Some cried that she had
escaped into the city in the guise of a slave, others that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230"></a>[<a href="./images/230.png">230</a>]</span>
she had descended into the cavern where stood the
gigantic Temple of Zomara.</p>

<p>Another fact puzzled us greatly. From our elevated
position we could see afar off a fierce conflict proceeding
near the city gate on that side where access could be
gained only by the steep flight of steps. Once, when I had
looked, I saw that the city was comparatively quiet; now,
however, this conflict had broken out again suddenly,
and judging from the smoke and tumult it must have
been terrific. All were surprised, and stood watching
the clouds of grey smoke roll up into the bright morning
air. But soon it died away, and believing it to be an
outbreak by the conquered troops subdued with a firm
hand by the victorious people, we thought no more of it.</p>

<p>The hours that succeeded were full of stirring
incidents, and it was long before the least semblance of
order could be restored in the city. With Kona I went
forth into the crowded, turbulent streets, and the sight
that met our gaze was awful. Bodies of soldiers and
civilians were lying everywhere, the faces of some, to
whom death had come swiftly, so calm and composed
that they looked as if they slept, while upon the blood-smeared
countenances of others, hideously mutilated
perhaps, were terrible expressions, showing in what
frightful agony they had passed into eternity. The road-ways
were strewn with heaps of corpses; the gutters
flowed with blood.</p>

<p>At such terrible cost had the tyrannical reign of the
Naya been terminated; by such a frightful loss of human
life had Omar been raised to the Emerald Throne.</p>

<p>Greater part of that eventful day was spent by Niaro,
Kona, Goliba and myself in restoring order, while the
people themselves, assisted by the troops, who had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231"></a>[<a href="./images/231.png">231</a>]</span>
already sworn allegiance to their young Naba, cleared
the streets and removed, as far as possible, all traces of
the deadly feud. But to us there came no tidings of
the Naya, although the strictest watch was kept everywhere
to prevent her escaping.</p>

<p>The people were determined that if she might not pay
the penalty of her evil deeds by death, she should at
least be held captive in one of the foul dungeons beneath
the palace, where so many of their relatives had rotted
and died in agony or starvation.</p>

<p>A blazing noontide was succeeded by a calm and peaceful
evening. Through many hours I had endeavoured,
as far as lay in my power, to assume the command given
me, and assisted by a number of quaintly-garbed officials
enthusiastic in Omar's cause, I found my office by no
means difficult. Order again reigning in the streets and
the bodies removed, the city had quietly settled down,
though of course not to its usual peacefulness. Crowds
of the more excited ones still surged up and down the
broad thoroughfares, calling down vengeance upon the
once powerful queen, but all voices were united in cheers
for the Naba Omar, their chosen ruler.</p>

<p>Save for those required to preserve order, the survivors
of the troops were back in barracks long before sunset,
and the palace-guard had been reorganised under Kona's
personal supervision. The Dagombas alone comprised
Omar's body-guard, and I found on my return to the
palace that they had exchanged their scanty clothes of
native bark-cloth for the rich bright-coloured silk
uniforms of those who had acted in a similar capacity to
the Naya. With their black happy shining faces they
looked a magnificent set of men, though for the first
few hours they appeared a trifle awkward in gay attire<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232"></a>[<a href="./images/232.png">232</a>]</span>
that was entirely strange to them. It was amusing, too,
to watch how each stalked by, erect and proud, like a
peacock spreading its brilliant plumage to the sun.</p>

<p>That night, when the bright moon rose, lighting up the
great silent court, until yesterday occupied by the terrible
queen and her corrupt <i>entourage</i>, Omar and I sat together
discussing the events of those fateful hours since midnight.
We had eaten from the gold dishes in which the
Naya's food had been served; we had quenched our
thirst from the jewel-encrusted goblets that she was wont
to raise to her thin blue lips. By Omar's side I thus
tasted, for the first time, the pleasures of royalty.</p>

<p>My old chum had sent away his attendants, the host
of slaves with the twelve Dagombas who acted as the
body-guard on duty, and we sat alone together in the
moonlight, the quiet broken only by the distant roll of a
drum somewhere down in the city, and the cool plashing
of the beautiful fountain as it fell softly into its crystal
basin. Kona, Goliba and Niaro were all away at their
duties, and now for the first time for many hours, we had
a few minutes to talk together.</p>

<p>"Do you know, Scars," Omar said, moving uneasily
upon the royal divan that had been carried out into the
court at his orders, while, tired out, I reclined upon
another close to him&mdash;"do you know there is but one
thing I regret, now that I have succeeded to the throne
that was my birthright?"</p>

<p>"Regret!" I exclaimed. "What regret can you
have? Surely you were entirely right in acting as you
did? The people were anxious for a just and upright
ruler, and having regard to the fact that your mother
plotted your assassination in so cold-blooded a manner,
her overthrow is justly deserved."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233"></a>[<a href="./images/233.png">233</a>]</span>
"Yes, yes, I know," he answered, rather impatiently.
"But it is not that&mdash;not that. One thing remains to
complete my happiness, but alas!"&mdash;&mdash;and he sighed
heavily without finishing his sentence.</p>

<p>"Why speak so despondently?" I inquired, surprised.
"As Naba of Mo all things are possible."</p>

<p>"Alas! not everything," he said, with an air of
melancholy.</p>

<p>"Well, tell me," I urged. "Why are you so downcast?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I have lost Liola," he answered hoarsely.
"Truth to tell, Scarsmere, I loved Goliba's daughter."</p>

<p>"She is absolutely beautiful," I admitted. "No man
can deny that she is handsome enough to share your
royal throne."</p>

<p>"Indeed she was," he said with emotion, his chin
upon his breast.</p>

<p>"Was!" I cried. "Why do you speak thus?"</p>

<p>"Because she is dead!" he answered huskily. "Ah!
Scars, you don't know how fondly I loved her ever since
the first moment we met. I loved her better than life;
better than all this honour and pomp to which I have
succeeded. Yet she has been taken from me, and my
life in future will be devoid of that happiness I had contemplated.
True I am Naba of Mo, successor to the
stool whereon a line of unconquered monarchs have sat
throughout a thousand years, yet all is an empty pleasure
now that my well-beloved is lost to me."</p>

<p>"Have you obtained definite news of her death?" I
asked sympathetically.</p>

<p>"Yes. When we were captured in Goliba's house,
she, too, was seized by the soldiers. While held powerless
I saw her struggling with her captors, for they had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234"></a>[<a href="./images/234.png">234</a>]</span>
somehow obtained knowledge of the part she had played
in our conspiracy against their queen. The Naya had,
it appears, ordered her guards to bring us all before her,
dead or alive. With valiant courage she resented the
indignity of arrest, and as a consequence she was brutally
killed by those who held her prisoner."</p>

<p>"How have you ascertained this?" I asked, shocked
at the news, for I myself had admired Liola's extraordinary
beauty.</p>

<p>"To-day I have had before me the three survivors of the
guards who captured us, and all relate the same story.
They say that a young girl, taken prisoner with us, while
being dragged up the roadway towards the palace was in
danger of being released by the people, and one of their
comrades, remembering the Naya's orders that none of
us were to escape, in the <i>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</i> raised his sword and
plunged it into her heart."</p>

<p>"The brute!" I cried. "Is the murderer among the
survivors?"</p>

<p>"No. All three agree that the mob, witnessing his
action, set upon him and literally tore him limb from
limb."</p>

<p>"A fate he certainly deserved," I said. "But has
her body been recovered?"</p>

<p>"A body has been found and I have seen it. But
the limbs are crushed, and her face is, alas! trampled
out of all recognition, although the dress answers exactly
to one that Goliba says his daughter possessed, and in
which I myself saw her. There is, alas! no doubt
of her fate. She has been brutally murdered, and at the
instigation of the Naya, who sent forth her fiendish
horde to kill us."</p>

<p>"I knew from the manner you exchanged glances with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235"></a>[<a href="./images/235.png">235</a>]</span>
Liola that you loved her," I said, after a pause, brief and
painful.</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered sadly. "Surreptitiously I had
breathed into her ear words of affection, and had been
transported to a veritable paradise of delight by the
discovery that she reciprocated my love. But," he
added, harshly, "my brief happy love-dream is now
ended. I must live and work only for my people;
they must be to me both sweetheart and wife. I must
act as my ancestors have done, indulging them and
loving them."</p>

<p>Never before, even in the moments when as fellow-adventurers
things looked blackest, had I seen him in
so utterly dejected an attitude. The light had died
from his face, and he had suddenly become burdened
by a monarch's responsibilities; prematurely aged by a
bitter sorrow that had sapped all youthful gaiety from
his buoyant heart.</p>

<p>With heartfelt sympathy I endeavoured to console
him, but all was unavailing. That he had loved her
madly was only too apparent, and it seemed equally
certain that she was dead, for shortly afterwards Goliba
entered, and in a voice full of emotion told us how he
had been able to identify the body, and that his tardy
attendance upon his royal master was due to the fact
that he had been superintending her burial.</p>

<p>The old sage's words visibly increased Omar's
burden of sorrow, for in the moonlight I saw a tear
trickle down his pale cheek, glistening for an instant
brighter than the jewels upon his robe. Liola had
fallen victim to the inhuman brutality of the Naya's
guards, and Mo had thus been deprived of a bewitchingly
handsome queen.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236"></a>[<a href="./images/236.png">236</a>]</span>
The <i>d&eacute;nouement</i> of this stirring story of a throne was
indeed a tragic one; Goliba had lost his only daughter,
the pride of his heart, and Omar the woman he loved.</p>

<p>The silence that followed was broken by a hasty
footstep, and the tall dark figure of Kona approached.</p>

<p>"A strange fact hath transpired, O Master!" he
cried breathlessly, addressing Omar.</p>

<p>"Speak, tell me," the young Naba exclaimed,
starting up. "Is it of Liola that thou bearest news?"</p>

<p>"Alas! no. That she was murdered in the first
moments of the conflict is only too certain," he answered.
"The news I bring thee is amazing. While we were
engaged in the struggle for thy throne, thine enemies,
the people of Samory, entered the city and fought side
by side with the military!"</p>

<p>"Samory's people here!" we all three cried, starting up.</p>

<p>"They were, but they have departed no one knows
whither. Their numbers were not great, but they
sacked and burned several large buildings near the city-gate
and fought desperately to join their allies the troops
of Mo, but were at last prevented and driven back by the
people in a fierce bloody conflict that actually occurred
after thou wert enthroned."</p>

<p>Then I remembered having noticed the smoke of the
encounter, and how with others, I had been puzzled.</p>

<p>"But how could they enter our country, and unseen
approach the city?" Omar exclaimed astounded.</p>

<p>"I know not the intricacies of the approaches to Mo
save the perilous Way of the Thousand Steps," Kona
replied. "The force may have been the rear-guard of
the army that attacked Mo, and were defeated in the
great chasm known as the Grave of Enemies. If they
approached by that means they must have followed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237"></a>[<a href="./images/237.png">237</a>]</span>
closely in our footsteps, and through the treachery of spies,
been admitted to the city at a time when the alertness
of the guards was diverted by the popular rising."</p>

<p>"Were their losses great in the fight?" Goliba asked.</p>

<p>"Terrible. Whole streets and market-places in the
vicinity of the entrance to the city were found strewn
with their dead," the black giant answered. "Apparently
the people discovered the identity of their
enemies and took no prisoners. With the exception of
about two hundred survivors all were killed."</p>

<p>"And the survivors have escaped!" Omar observed
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Yes. Owing to the lax watch kept at the gate
during those momentous hours, they were enabled to
descend the steps to the plain and get clear away."</p>

<p>"They must nevertheless be still in Mo. They must be
found," Omar cried excitedly. "While they are among
us our country will be in jeopardy, for they will act as
spies. Samory hath set his mind upon conquering this
our land; his plot must be frustrated."</p>

<p>"Already have I given orders for a search from the
land's most northerly limits even to the Grave of
Enemies, O Master," Kona answered. "All the men
who could be spared from guarding the city I have
dispatched on expeditions with orders to attack and
destroy the fugitives."</p>

<p>"They cannot have travelled far," the young ruler
said. "They have only about twelve hours' start of your
men."</p>

<p>"To a man our troops are now loyal to thee," the
newly-created chief of the army answered. "They are
alive to the fact that Samory's fighting-men are their
bitterest foes, therefore if the survivors of that intrepid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238"></a>[<a href="./images/238.png">238</a>]</span>
force are within our boundaries, they will assuredly be
overtaken and killed."</p>

<p>"I would rather that they were captured and held as
hostages," Omar said. "Enough blood hath been already
shed to-day."</p>

<p>"The order to capture them is not sufficient incentive
to thine army to rout them from their hiding-place," Kona
replied. "They have had the audacity to make a dash
upon thy city and burn some of its most renowned and
beautiful structures, therefore in their opinion if not in
thine, death alone would expiate their offence."</p>

<p>"I would wish their lives to be spared," Omar
repeated. "But the army is under thy control, and I
leave the final annihilation of the band of freebooters
unto thee. Hast thou obtained any tidings of the Naya's
flight?"</p>

<p>"None. My Dagombas have searched every nook
and corner of this thy palace, each prison dungeon
hath been entered by detachments of soldiers, while
enthusiastic parties have descended to the subterranean
Temple of Zomara, but found only the dwarf priests
there. The Naya hath disappeared as completely as
if Zomara had crushed her between his jaws."</p>

<p>"Her disappearance is amazing," Omar observed.
"Even her personal attendants whom I have questioned
are ignorant of the direction she hath taken. They
declare that she escaped within ten minutes of the
blowing up of the palace-gate. The catastrophe
alarmed her, and she saw in the fall of these defences
the instability of her throne."</p>

<p>"All is being done that can be done to secure her
arrest," Kona said. "It is absolutely necessary that we
should hold her captive, or, like the deposed queen of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239"></a>[<a href="./images/239.png">239</a>]</span>
the Nup&eacute;, she may stir up strife and form a plot to
reascend the stool."</p>

<p>"To thee, Kona, I look to guard me from mine
enemies," my friend exclaimed. "We must elucidate
the mystery of the sudden descent of this weak force of
Samory's, the rapidity with which they struck their blow,
and the means by which they have, within twelve hours,
so completely eluded us."</p>

<p>"News of them hath been flashed even unto the
furthermost limits of thy kingdom, O Great Chief,"
Kona assured him. "No effort shall be spared by thy
servant in executing thy commands. I go forth again,
and sleep shall not close my eyes until the men of
Samory have been overtaken."</p>

<p>With these words he made deep obeisance to the
newly-enthroned sovereign, and lifting his long native
spear, which he still retained, he swore vengeance most
terrible upon the enemies of Mo, who had, with such
consummate strategic skill, entered and attacked the city
at the moment when it remained undefended.</p>

<p>"There is some deep mystery underlying this, Scars,"
Omar said, when Kona had stalked away into the darkness,
and Goliba had risen and crossed the moon-lit
court in response to a message delivered by a black
slave. "I am scarcely surprised at Kona's failure to
capture the Naya; indeed, personally, I should only be
too happy to know that she had got safely beyond the
limits of Mo. But the sudden attack and rapid disappearance
of this marauding band of Samory proves two
things; first that our country, long thought impregnable,
may be invaded, and secondly that through Kouaga
Samory is in possession of certain of our secrets."</p>

<p>"What secrets?" I asked.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240"></a>[<a href="./images/240.png">240</a>]</span>
"Secrets upon the preservation of which the welfare
and safety of my country depend," he answered mysteriously.
Then, with a sudden air of dejection, he added:
"But there, what matters after all, now that Liola is
dead and my life is desolate? At the very moment when
the greatest honour has been bestowed upon me and I
am enthroned Naba, the saviour of my people, the
greatest sorrow has also fallen upon me."</p>

<p>After a moment's silence he started up in sudden
desperation, crying: "Slave have I been to evil all the
days of my life! I have toiled and earned nothing; I
have sown in care and reaped not in merriment; I have
poisoned the comfort of others, but no blessing hath
fallen into my own lap. Blasted are the paths whereon
I trod; my past actions are ravenous vultures gnawing
on my vitals, and the sharpened claws of malicious spirits
await my arrival among the regions of the accursed."</p>

<p>"Yes," I observed with a sigh, for the remembrance
of that bright, beautiful face was to me likewise one of
ineffable sadness. "Yes," I said, "Fate has indeed been
unkind. What she has bestowed with one hand, she
has taken away with the other."</p>

<p>Then we were silent. Above the cool plashing music
of the fountain could be heard the distant roar of voices
in great rejoicing, while upon the starlit sky was still
reflected a red ominous glare from the fires raging
in the city that no effort of man could subdue. At the
gate leading outward to the next court stood two
sentries with drawn swords gleaming in the moonbeams,
mute and motionless like statues, while echoing along
the colonnade was the measured tramp of the soldier
as he paced before the entrance of the gilded Hall of
Audience, the scene of so many stirring dramas in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241"></a>[<a href="./images/241.png">241</a>]</span>
nation's history. From the divan whereon I sat I could
see the great Emerald Throne glittering green under a
brilliant light, with its golden image of the sacred crocodile
and its banner bearing the hideous vampire-bat,
while around it were still grouped the officials of the
household, the body-guard of faithful Dagombas, the
slaves ready with their great fans, and Gankoma, the
executioner, with his bright double-edged <i>doka</i>, all
standing in patience, awaiting the coming of their royal
master.</p>

<p>The Court of Mo was, I reflected, a strange admixture
of European civilization and culture with
African superstition and barbarity. On the one hand
the buildings were of marble or stone, magnificent in
their proportions, with decorations in the highest style
of Moorish art, the arms were of the latest pattern
surreptitiously imported from England and many of
them faithfully copied by skilful, enlightened workmen;
electricity was known and used, and the tastes of the
people showed a refinement almost equal to that of any
European state. Yet in religion there prevailed the
crudest and most ignorant forms of superstition, one
of which was the horrible practice of burying alive all
sick persons, while the custom of the executioner accompanying
the reigning monarch everywhere, ready to
obey the royal command, was distinctly a relic of savage
barbarism.</p>

<p>"A few moments ago you spoke of secrets that must be
preserved," I said presently, turning to Omar.</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered slowly. "But my heart is too full
of poignant grief to think of them. To-night the secrets
are mine alone; to-morrow you shall be in possession of
at least one of them. I have, however, much yet to do, I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242"></a>[<a href="./images/242.png">242</a>]</span>
see, before I rest," he added, glancing over his shoulder
into the brilliant hall where stood the empty throne.</p>

<p>Then rising wearily, he sighed for Goliba's dead
daughter, and weighted by his rich robes, slowly strode
across to the arched entrance from which the light
streamed forth, and as he set foot upon its threshold
every proud head bowed to earth in deep, abject
obeisance.</p>

<h3>TREASURE AND TREASON.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">At</span> Omar's request a few days later I accompanied him
alone through a private exit of the palace, and ere long
we found ourselves unnoticed beyond the ponderous
city walls, where two horses, held by a slave, were
awaiting us. Mounting, we rode straight for the open
country, and not knowing whither we were going or
what were my companion's intentions, we soon left the
great city far behind. For fully three hours we pressed
forward, my companion avoiding any answer to my
questions as to our goal, until about noon we came to a
rising mount in the midst of a beautiful country with
palms and scattered orange-groves.</p>

<p>The scene was a veritable paradise. Beautiful fruits
peeped from between the foliage, and every coloured,
every scented flower, in agreeable variety intermingled
with the grass. Roses and woodbines, very much like
those in England, appeared in beauteous contention;
while beneath great trees were rich flocks of birds of
various feather. At the foot of the hill ran a clear,
transparent stream, which gently washed the margin
of the green whereon we stood. On the other side a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243"></a>[<a href="./images/243.png">243</a>]</span>
grove of myrtles, intermixed with roses and flowering
shrubs, led into shady mazes; in the midst of which
appeared the glittering tops of elegant pavilions, some
of which stood on the brink of the river, others had
wide avenues leading through the groves, and others
were almost hidden from sight by intervening woods.
All were calculated to give the ideas of pleasure rather
than magnificence, and had more ease than labour conspicuous.</p>

<p>"Beautiful!" I cried, gazing entranced upon the scene.</p>

<p>"Yes. From the moment we left the city and passed
through the ancient gateway that you admired, we have
been riding in my private domain. Here, as far as the
eye can reach, all is mine, the garden of the Sanoms.
But let us hasten forward. It was not to show you
picturesque landscapes that I brought you hither. We
have much to do ere we return."</p>

<p>Skirting the stream, where flocks and herds stood
gazing at their own images and others drinking of the
transparent waters, we found the river, growing wider,
opened into a spacious lake which was half surrounded
by a rising hill. From the lake, higher than the river,
ran a glittering cascade and over the pendant rocks
fell luxuriant vines and creeping plants. At the
opposite extremity of the lake, which by its pure
waters exposed the bright yellow pebbles on which it
wantoned, two streams ran towards the right and left of
the hill and lost themselves amidst the groves, pasture
and hillocks of the adjacent country. The prospects
around us were beautiful and enchanting. Lofty trees
threw a delightful, welcome shade, and the hill-side
seemed covered with flowering shrubs, which grew
irregularly except where a torrent from the summit, now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244"></a>[<a href="./images/244.png">244</a>]</span>
dry, had during ages worn out a deep hollow bed for
its rapid passage and descent.</p>

<p>There were no roads or beaten paths in this secluded
portion of the royal domain, neither could there be seen
any traces of habitation.</p>

<p>"Deep in yonder lake," said Omar, drawing up his
horse suddenly and swinging himself from his saddle near
the spot where the waters, springing from beneath some
green, moss-grown rocks, fell with gentle music into the
river&mdash;"deep in yonder lake there lies a hidden mystery."</p>

<p>"A mystery!" I cried. "What is it?"</p>

<p>"Have patience, and I will reveal to you a secret
known only to myself and to the Naya; the secret that
I told you must be preserved."</p>

<p>"But you say it is buried beneath these waters!" I
exclaimed, puzzled. "How will you reveal it?"</p>

<p>"Watch closely, so that if occasion arises you will
remember how to exactly imitate my movements," he
answered, and when we had tethered our horses, he led
me away from the edge of the lake up the hill-side some
distance to where a number of points of moss-grown rock
cropped up out of the turf.</p>

<p>After searching among them for some minutes he suddenly
stopped before one that rose from the ground
about three feet and was perhaps ten yards in circumference,
examining it carefully, at last giving vent to an
ejaculation of satisfaction.</p>

<p>"You see this rock, Scars!" he cried. "Does anything
about it appear to you remarkable?"</p>

<p>I bent, and feeling it with both my hands, carefully
examined its side, top and base.</p>

<p>"No," I answered, laughing. "As far as I can detect
it is the same as the others."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245"></a>[<a href="./images/245.png">245</a>]</span>
"You would never guess anything hidden there?" he
asked, smiling.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Well, watch and I'll show you." And with these
words the Naba of Mo approached the rock at a point
immediately facing me, and placing his hands upon the
side, about two feet from the ground, drew out bodily
a portion of its lichen-covered face about eighteen inches
square, that had been so deftly hewn that when in its
place none could detect it had ever been removed.</p>

<p>Peering into the cavity thus disclosed I saw, to my
surprise, what appeared to be a small iron lever, thickly
rusted, descending into some cog-wheeled mechanism of
a very complicated character.</p>

<p>"Now, watch the lake while I reveal to you its mystery,"
my companion said, placing his hands upon the lever.
With a harsh, grating noise it fell back beneath the
weight he threw upon it, and the harsh jarring of cog-wheels
revolving sounded for a few moments beneath
our feet. Then, as he set the mechanism in motion, my
gaze was fixed upon the lake and I stood aghast in
wonderment.</p>

<p>As the lever was drawn and the rusty cogs ran into one
another, the whole mass of rock damming the lake above
the small cascade where it fell into the river, gradually
rose, like a great sluice gate, allowing the waters to escape
and empty themselves, roaring and tumbling, into the
winding river beside which we had journeyed. It was
an amazing transformation, as imposing as it was unexpected.
A few seconds before, the river, shallow and
peaceful, fed by its tiny cascade, rippled away over its
pebbly bed; now, however, with the great volume of
water from the lake it rose so rapidly that the swirling,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246"></a>[<a href="./images/246.png">246</a>]</span>
boiling current overflowed its banks, sweeping everything
before it.</p>

<p>Nor was this the only result of pressing the lever, for
at the opposite end of the lake a similar outlet opened,
and as I looked I saw the water falling with a rapidity
that was astounding. Hydraulic power was evidently
known to these strange semi-civilized people, yet the actual
means by which the lake was so rapidly emptied I was
unable to discover, all the machinery being hidden away
in some subterranean chamber.</p>

<p>"By what cunning device is this accomplished?" I
inquired of Omar, who stood regarding the disappearing
flood with satisfaction.</p>

<p>"This mechanism was invented ages ago by one of my
ancestors," he answered. "Its exact date no man can
tell. But here water is given mastery over itself, and so
careful was its constructor to preserve the secret of its
existence that the slaves and workmen, all criminals,
were kept close prisoners during the whole time they
were at work, and on its completion they were all, without
a single exception, killed, in order that none should
know the secret save the reigning Naba and his heir."</p>

<p>"They were murdered then!"</p>

<p>"They were all criminals who for various serious
crimes had been condemned to death. It is said they
numbered over two hundred," Omar answered.</p>

<p>But even as he had been speaking the water of the
lake had so drained away that its clean stony bottom was
now revealed, the pebbles being exposed in large patches
here and there, while the deeper pools remaining were
alive with water-snakes and fish of all kinds. There
seemed but little mud, yet in the very centre of the
great basin was a patch of pebbles and rock higher than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247"></a>[<a href="./images/247.png">247</a>]</span>
the remainder, standing like a small island that, before
the lever had been touched, had been submerged. Leading
the way, Omar descended to the edge of the lake,
skirted it for some little distance, until he came to a long
row of flat stones placed together, forming stepping-stones
to the miniature island.</p>

<p>"Come," he said. "Follow me," and starting off we
were soon crossing the bed of the lake, being compelled
to advance cautiously owing to the slippery
nature of the weeds and water-plants that overgrew the
stones. On gaining the island, however, a fresh surprise
awaited me, for Omar, halting amid the mud in the
centre, exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Watch carefully, Scars. You may some day desire
to act as I am acting; but always remember that here
any undue hurry means inevitable death."</p>

<p>"Death! What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Wait, and you shall see," he replied, as stooping
suddenly he turned up the sleeves of his royal robe and
groping with his hand in the mud, at last discovered an
iron ring, green with slime, which, grasping with both
hands, he slowly twisted many times. A hissing sound
was emitted, as if the action of untwisting the ring relieved
some heavy pressure, admitting air to a chamber
that had been hermetically sealed. This surmise was, I
afterwards learned, correct. The unscrewing of this
ring caused the sides of a plate embedded in the mud to
contract, and air, so long excluded, entered the mysterious
place below.</p>

<p>In a few moments, having paused to wipe the perspiration
from his brow, Omar, again grasping the slippery
ring, gave it a sudden jerk and by that means lifted
the covering from a circular hole descending into an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248"></a>[<a href="./images/248.png">248</a>]</span>
impenetrable darkness, but bricked round like a cottage
well in England, and having projecting pieces of iron,
forming steps.</p>

<p>"Now," exclaimed Omar, as together we peered into
the mysterious opening. "To descend at once would
mean certain death."</p>

<p>"How? Is the air below foul?"</p>

<p>"Not at all. The ingenuity of my ancestor who constructed
this place made arrangements to avoid all that.
The danger arises from a contrivance he devised by
which any person attempting to explore it and being unaware
of the means to guard against death, must be inevitably
swept into eternity. Now, in order to give you
an illustration of this danger I will show you the result
of any adventurous person stepping down."</p>

<p>Taking from the mud a long iron bar, which he
observed incidentally was kept there for the purpose of
guarding against death, he reached down the shaft and
placing the end of the bar upon the third step, threw his
whole weight upon it, saying:</p>

<p>"We will suppose you have descended until your feet
stand upon this step. Now, watch."</p>

<p>As the weight fell upon the step it gave way so slightly
as to be almost imperceptible, but suddenly from hidden
cavities around the well-like shaft there came six rings of
long, sharp steel spikes, set inwards, three above and
three below, which, contracting as they came forward, met
and interlaced. In an instant I recognised what terrible
fate would be the lot of any adventurer who dared to
enter that dark shaft. The action of stepping upon that
fatal projecting iron released hydraulic pressure of
irresistible power, and the unfortunate one, unable to
ascend or descend by reason of the danger being above<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249"></a>[<a href="./images/249.png">249</a>]</span>
and below, must be impaled by a hundred cruel spikes,
sharp and double-edged like spears, while the bands
whereon they were set must crush his bones to pulp.</p>

<p>I looked at this terrible device for producing an
agonizing death and shuddered. The precautions taken
to prevent anyone entering the place were the most
elaborate and ingenious I had ever seen. Even if any
person learnt the secret of draining the lake, the shaft
leading to the mysterious subterranean place was unapproachable
by reason of this extraordinary mechanical
device.</p>

<p>During five minutes the spikes remained interlaced,
then automatically they disengaged themselves, and
slowly fell back into the cavity running round the brickwork,
wherein they remained concealed.</p>

<p>Thrice again did Omar repeat this action of pressing
the bar upon the step, each time with an exactly similar
result, chatting to me the while. Then, when for the
third time the spikes had fallen back into their places,
he said:</p>

<p>"Now the secret to avoid this and lock the mechanism
is to turn back this little lever and place it in this catch,
so. This cannot, however, be done unless the step
has been pressed three times."</p>

<p>And bending over he showed me another tiny lever
thickly encrusted with rust, secreted behind a movable
brick in the first tier below the lake's bottom. This he
placed in position, securing it in a niche so that it
became immovable.</p>

<p>"Now," he said, "we may descend without fear," and
with these words knelt down, and after lighting a torch he
had brought with him, commenced the descent into the
cavernous gloom. I quickly followed, my feet resting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250"></a>[<a href="./images/250.png">250</a>]</span>
for a brief instant upon the fatal iron projection, but no
spikes came forward, for the terrible mechanism was now
locked. Deep down into this circular shaft we went, the
smoke and sparks from Omar's torch ever ascending into
my face as I lowered myself from rung to rung, until at
last, at considerable depth, we found ourselves in a kind
of natural cavern. The place seemed damp and full of
bad odours, to which submitting with patience we, by a
long passage, sometimes crawling under rugged arches,
sometimes wading in mud and dirt, attained the end of
the cavern, where we stumbled on some narrow steps;
but the torch shed little light, and we became nearly
suffocated by the noisome vapours.</p>

<p>"I thought you said the air was fresh here," I exclaimed
good-humouredly to my companion.</p>

<p>"So I did," he answered. "I cannot make out why
it has become so foul. The air-holes must have become
accidentally stopped up."</p>

<p>The widening ascent was so intricate and clogged
with dirt and rubbish that we worked like moles in the
dark; nevertheless, by diligent industry we gained
ground considerably, yet as we endeavoured to mount,
the slimy steps slipped from under us, and ever and
anon we would come tumbling down with a weight of
dirt upon us.</p>

<p>After various labours, however, we suddenly entered a
great cavern, quite dry. From its roof hung great
stalactites that glittered and sparkled in the torch's uncertain
light, while around the rough walls of this natural
chamber were heaped in profusion great heavy chests of
iron and adamant.</p>

<p>With the torch held high above his head Omar rushed
across to the pile and bending, examined one chest after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251"></a>[<a href="./images/251.png">251</a>]</span>
the other. Then, raising himself as the truth suddenly
dawned upon him, he cried in a hoarse, excited voice:</p>

<p>"By the power of Zomara, we have been tricked!"</p>

<p>"Tricked! How?" I gasped in alarm.</p>

<p>"Cannot you see?" he wailed. "This, the Treasure-house
of the Sanoms, has been entered and its contents,
worth a fabulous sum, have been extracted! See! Each
trunk has been forced by explosives!"</p>

<p>I gazed eagerly where he directed, and saw that the
trunks of iron and stone had been blown open by gunpowder,
for on each remained a blackened patch, showing
plainly the means used to force the strong chest wherein
reposed the magnificent jewels, the vessels of gold, and
the historic gem-encrusted and invulnerable armour of the
Nabas of Mo.</p>

<p>"Then this is the place the secret of which the
villainous old Arab, Samory, endeavoured to wrench from
you by torture," I exclaimed, gazing round the grim,
weird cavern.</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered. "This is the Treasure house of
my ancestors. Since the days of King Karmos each
Naba or Naya has added to the great store of treasure
amassed for the purpose of the emancipation of our
country in the day of need. Only the reigning monarch
and the heir have, in any generation, ever known the
secret of how the Treasure-house can be approached&mdash;the
secret I have to-day revealed to you as Keeper of
the Treasure."</p>

<p>"But if you alone knew the secret, who could have
ransacked the place?" I asked. "The chests seem to
have been recently opened."</p>

<p>"True," he answered, and pointing to a heap of
bejewelled swords, breastplates and helmets, that had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252"></a>[<a href="./images/252.png">252</a>]</span>
apparently been hastily cast aside as the least valuable
of the great treasure, he added: "All the most historic
and beautiful jewels have been taken, and the gold
vessels and things of minor value left. See! It is
plain that the theft was accomplished in all haste, for
there was scarce time to sort the gems that are unique
from those rivalled by others."</p>

<p>"It certainly looks as if the jewels were secured in
feverish haste," I said, at the same time picking up from
the uneven floor a bronze oil lamp lying overturned and
discarded.</p>

<p>Together we set about making a systematic examination
of the various chests, numbering nearly one
hundred. Those fashioned from single stones were
of great age, looking like coffins, while those of iron
were ponderous caskets bound with huge bands, studded
and double-locked, with great antique hinges of marvellous
workmanship. With perhaps half a dozen exceptions
the lid of each had yielded to the charge of
explosive placed beneath it, while in many cases the
whole side of the casket had been blown completely
out, injuring or destroying some of its valuable contents.
Jewellery and gems, set and unset, had been strewn about
and trodden into the dust by hurrying feet, and a few
that I recognized at once as of fabulous value had been
overlooked. Stooping, I picked up from the dirt a
marvellously-cut ruby, almost the size of a pigeon's egg.
But the majority of the treasure-chests had been
emptied. The place had been visited, and the vast
wealth of a nation stolen.</p>

<p>"For the first time in the long, glorious history of
my land has the Treasure-house been entered by
thieves," Omar said, as if to himself. "No mere<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253"></a>[<a href="./images/253.png">253</a>]</span>
adventurer can have been here; this great robbery is
the result of some base conspiracy. The treasure of the
Sanoms, renowned through the whole world as the most
wondrous collection of magnificent and unsurpassable
gems, has been cleared out and the entrance re-closed in
a manner little short of marvellous. To-day is indeed
a sad one for Mo, and for me. My inheritance has
been taken from me."</p>

<p>"By whom?" I inquired, continuing my way, examining
one of the few chests that had apparently not been
tampered with. But, as in the gloom I hastened from
one casket to another, my foot suddenly struck against
some object, causing me to lose my balance, and thus
tripped, were it not for the fact that I clutched at the
corner of the great chest, I should have fallen upon my
face.</p>

<p>Bending to examine what it was, I was amazed to
discover the body of a male slave, still dressed in the
uniform of the servants of the palace, but rapidly decomposing.
It was the faint sickening odour emitted from
the corpse that had greeted our nostrils when we
entered the place.</p>

<p>We both bent and looked at him, astounded at discovering,
still imbedded in his back, a long keen knife.
He had been struck down from behind and murdered,
while in the act of securing some of the treasure, for his
brown withered fingers still grasped a beautiful necklet
of magnificent pearls, an ornament worth several
thousand English pounds.</p>

<p>"That is one of the Naya's personal attendants,"
observed Omar, recognizing the dress, but unable to distinguish
the features of the murdered man, so decomposed
were they. "He perhaps participated in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254"></a>[<a href="./images/254.png">254</a>]</span>
the plot, and to secure his silence, or his portion of
the booty, his fellow-conspirators struck him to earth."</p>

<p>"But to whom is due the chief responsibility in this
affair?" I asked. "Surely you have some suspicion?"</p>

<p>"I know not," he answered. "Besides myself only
the Naya knew the secret means by which the treasure
might be reached."</p>

<p>"Then in all probability she secured it before her
flight!" I cried.</p>

<p>"That may be the truth," he answered in a tone of
suppressed agitation. "Immediately she obtained
knowledge through her spies of my intention to disobey
her, she may have secured the most valuable of the
jewels and had them packed ready to take them with her
if compelled to flee. Yet somehow I cannot believe she
has done this, for their removal must have attracted
attention. No, I believe we shall have to look in
another quarter for the thief." Then, bending again
to examine the hilt of the knife embedded in the body
of the unfortunate slave, he added: "That poignard was
hers. She carried it always in her girdle, and it seems,
after all, as though this man was her confidant and
assistant, and that here alone she closed his lips by
murdering him. Yet to her, life was more valuable
than the treasure, and I cannot believe that she risked
detection and capture in order to secure what she might
afterwards obtain by the assistance of hirelings."</p>

<p>"A dark tragedy has certainly been enacted," I said,
glancing around the gruesome place with its gloomy
corners and crevices where the blackness was impenetrable.
"The theft has been accompanied by a secret
assassination at some coward's hand."</p>

<p>"Yes," he exclaimed, standing with folded arms and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255"></a>[<a href="./images/255.png">255</a>]</span>
chin sunk upon his breast. "The great treasure,
belonging not only to our family but to our nation, has
been stolen, and I swear by Zomara's power that I will
seek out the thief and recover it. I am Naba, and it
is my duty to my people to restore their wealth to its
hiding-place. Each successive ruler has enriched his
country by making additions to the store of jewels, and it
shall never be recorded that on finding the most valuable
of our possessions stolen, I made no effort to trace and
recover them. True, they have been abstracted in a
manner almost miraculous for ingenuity and rapidity, but
from this moment I will not rest until they are recovered.
And you, Scarsmere, as Keeper of the Treasure-house,
shall assist me."</p>

<p>"I am ready," I answered, excited at the prospect of
this new task before us. "We will spare no effort to
seek the thief and recover the Treasure of the Sanoms.
It is, as you declare, a duty, and I am ready and
anxious to commence the search."</p>

<h3>A SPY'S STARTLING STORY.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">We</span> remained fully two hours in the noisome Treasure-chamber
of the Sanoms, the early history of which was
lost in the mist of legendary lore, then after careful and
minute examination of the rifled chests, worked our
way to the base of the shaft, and, having ascended, let
down the tiny concealed lever, thereby allowing the
pressure to increase, and place in position the ingenious
contrivance for causing death to the venturesome. Replacing
the iron plate that closed the mouth of the well-like
aperture, we screwed it down, rendering it water-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256"></a>[<a href="./images/256.png">256</a>]</span>tight,
and, crossing the stones, regained the bank of the
lake. Then, having turned back the lever, the flood-gates
slowly closed down again, and, ere we mounted our
horses to ride back to the city, the waters, fed by the
many torrents, had already risen sufficiently to hide the
slime-covered entrance to the secret chamber.</p>

<p>One of the greatest thefts in the world's history had
been committed, and the question that puzzled us was
the identity of the thief. Our first suspicions had fallen
upon the Naya, but calmly discussing the question as
we rode back, we both became convinced that so critical
was the deposed ruler's position, that she would never
have undertaken all the risks in removing the treasure.
She knew she was in deadly peril of her life, and that
every moment lost was of vital importance, therefore it
was hardly probable that she would have delayed her
departure to secure the wealth of her ancestors.</p>

<p>Omar argued that if compelled to fly she might have
afterwards entrusted the secret of the Treasure-house to
spies, who could have returned and secured the jewels.
That she had not done this was certain, for the time
that had elapsed since her flight was insufficient.</p>

<p>I suggested that the detachment of Samory's men who
had entered the city during the revolt might have had
knowledge of the secret and secured the treasure, but
Omar pointed out that none in Samory's camp could
have been aware of the means by which the place could
be entered, Kouaga himself being in ignorance.</p>

<p>"Then the thief was the Naya herself," I said, decisively.</p>

<p>"No; after all, I am not actually positive that such is
the case," he answered. "There are facts connected
with the affair, trivial in themselves, that lead me to
believe otherwise."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257"></a>[<a href="./images/257.png">257</a>]</span>
"What are they?"</p>

<p>"One is that the wonderful ruby necklet, an ornament
of matchless gems that belonged to King Karmos
and is one of the talismans of the Sanoms, has been left.
I found it flung aside and discarded. Had the Naya
committed the theft she would have secured this first of
all, because of our family tradition that no reigning
Sanom can live longer than three moons without it is in
his or her possession."</p>

<p>"But you retain it," I said. "You, at least, are safe."</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied thoughtfully. "Yet if the Naya
had intended to secure the treasure for herself she would
most certainly have taken this first of all. It is one
of the most historic and valuable ornaments of the
royal jewels of Mo, besides being one in which most
superstition is centred. In her flight she would entertain
the bitterest ill-feeling towards me and desire my
rule to be brief. Therefore, she must have stolen the
necklet; she would have secured that, if nothing else."</p>

<p>I was compelled to agree with this view, especially as
he added that one of the most firm beliefs of the
Sanoms had ever been that Zomara would send vengeance
most terrible upon any who removed the treasure
from its chests without the sanction of the people. No,
it seemed evident that some third person had been in
possession of the secret. Who, we knew not, but were
determined to discover.</p>

<p>On returning to the palace I stood, as usual, beside
the Emerald Throne while its occupant gave audience
to those who came to make obeisance and offer congratulations.
The Court of the Naba Omar was even
more brilliant than that of his mother had been, and at
evening, under the bright lights, was, indeed, a glitter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258"></a>[<a href="./images/258.png">258</a>]</span>ing
assembly, where the gems worn by officials and
courtiers almost dazzled one's eyes by their profuseness.</p>

<p>Days passed&mdash;bright, peaceful days succeeding the
brief period of feverish excitement and deadly hatred.
Mo had become herself again; her people assured that
an era of liberty and prosperity had recommenced, her
ruler leaving no effort unspared to act in the best interests
of his beloved nation. By day the great sunny
courts of the palace, with the bright flowers and fruit-laden
vines, rang with the tramp of armed men and
tall, stately officials; by night the sounds of revelry,
music and dancing awakened the echoes of the great
moon-lit colonnades, and was wafted on the sweet-scented
air afar beyond the grim, frowning outer walls.</p>

<p>Yet the burden of kingship seemed to press heavily
upon the young Naba. Though wearing no diadem, his
brow soon became furrowed, as if by its weight, and his
air was one of constant preoccupation. His change of
manner puzzled me. His mind appeared overshadowed
by some gloomy foreboding, the nature of which I could
by no amount of cautious questioning elicit. During
each day he attended assiduously without relaxation to
affairs of state, and when night drew on and the inmates
of the great luxurious palace, a veritable city within a
city, gave themselves up to reckless enjoyment, he was
seldom present, for he would withdraw to one of his
small private apartments, and there sit, pretending to
read, but in reality brooding in silence. One poignant
sorrow had transformed him from a bright, happy youth,
to a man sad-eyed, dull, morose. Sometimes, as I
watched, I noticed how he would suddenly sigh heavily,
and set his teeth as a bitter relentless expression would
flit for an instant across his countenance, and I knew<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259"></a>[<a href="./images/259.png">259</a>]</span>
that at such moments there entered into his heart the
contemplation of a fierce and terrible revenge.</p>

<p>Even to me, his constant companion, whose opinion
he sought almost hourly, he made no mention of his
heart's sorrow, yet from close observation through many
days, I knew the cause of his overwhelming grief was
the loss of Liola. He never mentioned her, for the
day after we had ascertained the truth about her tragic
end, he had taken me aside and asked me never to
allow her name to pass my lips in his presence.</p>

<p>"Memories are painful, you know, Scars," he had said.
"I must try and forget, try and live down my sorrow if I
can, although I fear I shall carry it with me to the grave."</p>

<p>These words I often remembered when, alone with him,
I watched the look of ineffable sadness upon his face.
In the Hall of Audience, the centre of his brilliant court,
his face was always pleasant, smiling and full of good-nature,
as it had ever been; but, alas! it was only a
mask, for alone, in the privacy of his chamber, he cast
it aside and gave himself up to debauches of melancholy
painful to behold.</p>

<p>Thus weeks lengthened into months. He had wished
me to keep from the people the great loss sustained by the
robbery from the Treasure-house, believing that in the
circumstances silence was best, and I had not breathed
a word to a soul, not even to Kona or Goliba. The
city had resumed its old look of prosperity, its markets
were crowded daily, and its populace were content in
the knowledge that under the reformed <i>r&eacute;gime</i> they
were free. Although once every week, Omar, with his
court, descended to the Temple of Zomara, and there
adored the Crocodile-god, human sacrifices had been
discontinued, and the worship of the giant idol was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260"></a>[<a href="./images/260.png">260</a>]</span>
devoid of those revolting practices introduced by the
Naya. Of the latter, no tidings had been gleaned.
Although every effort had been made to trace her, she
had disappeared. Of the treasure of the Sanoms, too,
nothing had been heard. How it had been conveyed
out of Mo remained an inscrutable mystery.</p>

<p>I confess to being astonished that Omar seldom, if
ever, spoke of either of these matters, which had at first
so seriously agitated him. Whether he had relinquished
all thought of recovering the jewels collected by his
ancestors, or whether he was endeavouring to formulate
some plan of action I knew not, yet his unwillingness to
speak of them was, to say the least, noteworthy.</p>

<p>"Niaro has to-day returned from the gate of Mo," I
observed one evening when we were sitting alone together
in one of the smaller courts, the night air stirred
by the distant sound of stringed instruments and the
thumping of Moorish tam-tams. "He has sent messengers
by the Way of the Thousand Steps far into the
lands beyond, but no word have they been able to gather
regarding the Naya."</p>

<p>"She has escaped the mad vengeance of our people,
who would have killed her," he said, calmly. "For that
I am thankful."</p>

<p>"You seem to have no desire that she should be
captured," I said.</p>

<p>"None. She has escaped. After all it is best."</p>

<p>"But the treasure," I said, dropping my voice so that
no eavesdropper might overhear. "Its hiding place,
like the thief, is still unknown."</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered. "Unknown at present, but ere
long some discovery must be made. When it is, I anticipate
it will be a startling one."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261"></a>[<a href="./images/261.png">261</a>]</span>
Our conversation was interrupted at that moment by
the approach of a slave who, bowing low until his brow
touched our carpet, said:</p>

<p>"One of thy servants, O Master, desireth to have
speech with thee. He hath sped from afar upon the
wings of haste and beareth tidings."</p>

<p>"Of what?" cried Omar, starting up.</p>

<p>"I know not, O Master. The name of thy servant
who awaiteth audience with thee is Makhana, who
cometh from beyond the great black water."</p>

<p>"Makhana!" we both cried, and Omar ordered that
he should be admitted immediately, and without ceremony.
Then, turning to me, he explained that on
ascending the throne he had sent a message to Makhana
in London ordering him to return at once.</p>

<p>A moment later the secret agent of Mo, a tall, sparse
figure, attired in shabby European clothes, entered, and,
snapping fingers with his master, greeted and congratulated
him. Then, casting himself upon the mat near us,
he began to tell us what had occurred after our flight
from Eastbourne, and relate the latest news from the
civilised land we had left so many months before. I
also told him how we had been enticed away by Kouaga,
and the order of the Naya for Omar's assassination.</p>

<p>"Much has happened since I returned," Omar observed,
when I had concluded. "As you have no
doubt already heard, my mother has been deposed, and
I have been enthroned in her stead."</p>

<p>"Yes," the secret agent answered. "I have already
heard all this, and although I wish you every peace and
prosperity, I have, I regret, to make a startling announcement."</p>

<p>"What is it?" gasped Omar, with wide-open eyes.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262"></a>[<a href="./images/262.png">262</a>]</span>
"Our enemy, Samory, is upon us!"</p>

<p>"Samory!" we both cried.</p>

<p>"Yes. Not much longer than a moon past I was
crossing the mountains of Niene, near the confines of
his country, on my way hither from the sea, and learnt
the truth. Two moons ago, accompanied by twenty
thousand armed men, Kouaga marched out of Koussan
to obtain savage allies for an expedition, having for its
object the conquest of Mo."</p>

<p>"The conquest of our country!" Omar cried
astounded. "Only a week before we returned hither
one of his expeditions was utterly routed and
slaughtered in the Grave of Enemies. Now another
has been dispatched! What route has it taken?"</p>

<p>"On learning the news I at once reassumed native
dress, crossed into our enemy's country and acted as
spy," Makhana answered, his fierce-looking eyes glistening
in the moonlight. "In Koussan I ascertained that
the expedition, led by Kouaga, the man who was once
our Grand Vizier, had gone northward one moon's
journey towards the Niger, his intention being to skirt
the country of the Aribanda and to enter our territory
from the north by crossing the Hombori Mountains."</p>

<p>"You have done well to ascertain this and hasten
on," Omar answered. "But there is only one pass by
which the Hombori can be crossed."</p>

<p>"That is known to Kouaga, for three years ago he
led our army through it to the successful conquest of
the border tribes of the Massina. He is now a formidable
enemy, for he knows all the secret approaches and
the whereabouts of our hidden defences."</p>

<p>"We must dispatch an army at once to meet them,"
Omar said, after a thoughtful pause.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263"></a>[<a href="./images/263.png">263</a>]</span>
"No time should be lost," Makhana urged. "Already
they are due at the Hombori, and it will occupy our
expedition fully two weeks to reach there. Yet Samory's
hordes may be delayed, and if so, we shall be able to
hold the pass successfully and sweep them down as
they advance. I have brought with me from England
the ten additional Maxims ordered by the Naya."</p>

<p>"Excellent, let them be given into Kona's charge,"
Omar exclaimed, explaining briefly that the Dagomba
head-man was now in command of the troops, and then
turning to the slave who stood in waiting he ordered that
Kona should be fetched immediately, and that the council
and principal officers should be at once summoned.</p>

<p>In a few minutes we saw upon the clear night-sky long
beams of light, and knew that signals were being flashed
from Mo to the furthermost limits of the kingdom,
summoning the officers from their various posts to a
council of war. Twenty thousand men, with a similar
number of savage allies, under a leader who was well
acquainted with all the intricacies of the secret way were
advancing upon Mo, and the faces of the officers and
members of the council became grave when, on arrival
at the palace, they heard the astounding news.</p>

<p>That Mo was threatened by a serious calamity was
recognized by everyone. The news spread through the
city quickly, and throughout the night the streets were
agog. Only by swift vigorous defence, by pushing a
great force forward night and day to the point of attack,
could a catastrophe be averted. This was the unanimous
opinion of the Naba's advisers, and ere the sun rose the
first detachment of the defending army was already on
its way to meet the Arab invaders.</p>

<p>Kouaga evidently meant making a sudden descent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264"></a>[<a href="./images/264.png">264</a>]</span>
upon the mysterious country, and if his force once
accomplished the passage through the mountain pass
they would then no doubt make a rapid dash towards
the capital itself, and would approach it at its only
vulnerable point.</p>

<p>If this occurred, then the slaughter must be terrible
and the catastrophe complete.</p>



<hr class="full" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXII" id="CHAPTER_XXXII"></a>CHAPTER XXXII.</h2>

<h3>WAR.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Twelve</span> days later I found myself accompanying Kona
who, at the head of a great force of over eighteen
thousand men, was crossing the treacherous quicksands
by the Way of the Thousand Steps. The critical position
of Mo had been fully discussed by Omar, his officers
and sages, and it had been decided to send, in addition
to the force of twenty thousand men to the Hombori
Mountains on the northern frontier, a second expedition
to travel with all swiftness across the sandy plain and
make a dash upon Samory's stronghold at Koussan in
the absence of its picked troops.</p>

<p>Within two days after Makhana had brought news of
the coming invasion, the whole of the twenty thousand
men, with Omar himself at their head, had marched out
of the capital on their way to defend the pass. I had
expressed a wish to accompany them, but my friend had
requested me to go with the expedition to Samory's
capital because, having been there in captivity, I could
act as guide. To this I made no objection, and bidding
farewell to Omar, Goliba and Niaro at the city gate, I
had watched them ride away at the head of a brilliant
cavalcade, and the same evening at sundown descended<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265"></a>[<a href="./images/265.png">265</a>]</span>
the face of the cliff by the long flight of steps, and
jumping into the saddle of a horse held ready for me,
rode with all haste to catch up Kona who, as leader of
our expedition, had already started for the gigantic precipice
known as the Gate of Mo.</p>

<p>To Niaro, an excellent officer, the leadership of the
defending force had been entrusted, as he had already
had experience of fighting in the Hombori country,
having been second in command of Kouaga's expedition
when he conquered the tribes of Massina, while Kona,
who had with him his valiant Dagombas, had orders to
enrol another thousand men of that tribe when passing
through their territory, prior to our dash upon Samory's
country.</p>

<p>The passage to the desert by the Way of the Thousand
Steps was a brilliant feat, for of our great force not a
single life was lost, and so rapidly did we travel, that
within two weeks of the day we left the palace, our
Dagombas, who preferred their native spears and arrows
to firearms, were enrolled and we were well on our way
to the Great Salt Road, a mere native path notwithstanding
its imposing designation, towards Samory's great
fortress-city.</p>

<p>Heedless of the noontide heat we pushed forward
over stony desert and green grass-land, now plunging
into those gloomy dismal forests of eternal darkness
where the stench of decaying vegetation sickened us,
only to emerge again into the open plain devoid of
shade, scorched by the pitiless rays of the fiery sun.
Snatching brief rests, and pushing for ever onward our
great host of armed men and carriers, with the vigilant
Kona at their head, pressed forward, entering at last the
land of our enemies.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266"></a>[<a href="./images/266.png">266</a>]</span>
The Dagomba scouts, travelling before us, splendid
fellows, all eyes and ears, who could detect the slightest
indication of an enemy's presence far or near, whether
it were the broken twig at one's feet or the sudden rising
of a bird in the distance, kept us well informed of all
transpiring on every side. For a hundred miles we
marched through the Arab chieftain's land without any
of its inhabitants dreaming of the presence of a hostile
force, and it was only by our sudden descent one night
upon the small walled town of Torola, which we sacked
and burned, that they were awakened to the truth.</p>

<p>But ere the news could spread to Koussan, about forty
English miles distant, we, by a forced march, had
already reached the capital. Making a dash upon the
place by night with our Maxim and Hotchkiss guns, the
garrison were completely taken by surprise, nevertheless
so well were its high white walls defended, that our
forces were driven back with severe loss.</p>

<p>Undaunted however, Kona, who placed himself at the
head of our Dagomba allies, backed by the well-armed
soldiers of Mo, made a second assault upon a point that
had been indicated by our spies as weaker than the
others. The fighting was desperate, and the sight,
viewed from where I was standing with the reinforcements,
was one of exceeding grandeur. Night was
rendered almost bright as day by the constant flashing of
guns, and the noise of the tumult ever increasing sounded
high above the constant roar of artillery. Suddenly,
as I gazed across the plain to where the sharp conflict
was proceeding, a brilliant blue flash blinded me and
an instant later a deafening explosion caused the ground
to tremble, while the red light of the guns gleamed
through the increasing veil of smoke, and I saw that our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267"></a>[<a href="./images/267.png">267</a>]</span>
men had successfully placed a mine beneath that portion
of the fortifications near where they were fighting, and it
had been fired, effecting a great breach through which
they next moment poured, engaging the defenders hand
to hand.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards a signal light flashed thrice, as had
been agreed, and six thousand men, including myself,
sped over the plain to reinforce our comrades. Soon,
clambering over the fallen masonry where the enormous
breach had been made, I found myself with my sword,
the one I had used in the conquest of Mo, hacking
right and left, endowed with a strength that only came
to me in moments of intense excitement.</p>

<p>The dash we made was indeed a brilliant one. The
Arab defenders were, we found, fully equal to us in
numbers and were withal magnificent soldiers, for in
the broad squares of the city their cavalry, with their
white flowing robes and heavy curved swords, committed
frightful havoc in our ranks, yet in such numbers had
we clambered into the great chieftain's stronghold that
they became gradually hampered in the streets and,
unable to man&oelig;uvre, were compelled to dismount and
engage us in combat. The fight proved an even more
desperate and bloody one than that which resulted in
the dethronement of the Naya. So equally matched
were the forces, that the struggle raged with frightful
ferocity, each side determined to secure the victory.
In the old Moorish-looking streets, so narrow that two
asses could scarce pass abreast, there were encounters
more desperate than any I had ever witnessed, for the
soldiers of Samory and the fighting-men of Mo, the two
most fierce and valiant forces in the whole of the African
continent, were pitted against each other.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268"></a>[<a href="./images/268.png">268</a>]</span>
Cutting our way forward, I found myself at last beneath
the high whitewashed wall of the great Djam&auml;a
Thelatha Biban, or Mosque of the Three Gates, one of
the most ancient in the city. I recognised it by its fine
dome standing out white against the flame-illumined
sky, and remembered that when a captive in the hands
of the brutal Arab ruler, Omar had translated to me
the fine Kufic inscription on its handsome fa&ccedil;ade,
recording its construction by Mohammed Ibn Kheiroun
el-Ma&auml;feri in the second century of the Hedjira. For a
moment I paused under its handsome entrance of black
and white marble, when suddenly Kona rushed towards
me, crying:</p>

<p>"Quick, Master! Fly for thy life, here, across the
square!" and as he tore away as fast as his long black
legs would carry him, I followed wondering.</p>

<p>Scarcely had we reached the opposite side of the great
market-place when a deafening roar sounded, and an
instant later, as I turned, I saw the great dome crack,
tremble and collapse, together with the high white
minaret, while the whole of its fa&ccedil;ade fell out with a
terrific crash in the opposite direction. Our men had
blown up the principal mosque in Samory's capital, an
action which increased tenfold the rage of our fierce
fanatical enemies.</p>

<p>With loud yells they fell upon us from every quarter,
when a few minutes later they realised what had been
done, and during the next hour the conflict became
terrific. Hundreds were struck to earth by bullets and
swords, and it appeared to me, striving as I was in the
midst of the smoke and heat of battle, that the longer
we fought the more numerous became the defenders,
and the less our chance of success. Yet slowly we had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269"></a>[<a href="./images/269.png">269</a>]</span>
succeeded in cutting our way from the city wall up the
hill crowned by the great white Kasbah, or fortress,
which constituted Samory's palace, and were now
actually within sight of it. Fiercely exerting every
muscle we fought to attain our goal, but so desperate
was the defence, that time after time our forward movement
was prevented, and we were compelled to fall back
bleeding and frustrated. In these valiant attempts to
reach the walls of the Kasbah there fell, at a low
estimate, fully five hundred of that portion of the force
to which I had attached myself. With reinforcements
we might have flung back the defenders, yet separated
as we had been into small bodies during the earlier
man&oelig;uvres, fighting was now taking place in every part
of the city, no two bodies being able to unite their forces.</p>

<p>To thus cut us off one from another had, no doubt,
been the tactics of the defenders, for we afterwards
learnt that in many instances the smaller of our gallant
little bands had been slaughtered literally to a man.</p>

<p>At last, however, my worst fears began to be realized,
for the defenders, receiving reinforcements, swooped
suddenly down upon us, and with their swords and
those sharp double-edged knives they carried in their
belts, wrought frightful havoc among us everywhere,
while upon us another body poured a terrible fire from
their long-barrelled rifles.</p>

<p>As result of this, although we made a spirited stand,
once again we were compelled to fall back in confusion,
leaving many dead and dying upon the stones.
Suddenly I heard Kona's well-known voice behind me
uttering the fierce war yell of the Dagombas, and next
instant we found to our satisfaction that a great body of
his dark oily-faced warriors had come to our relief.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270"></a>[<a href="./images/270.png">270</a>]</span>
The reckless and savage manner in which they fought a
few moments later was astounding, and it was certainly
due to their courage and strength that the Arabs were
first forced back and then cut to pieces and utterly
routed.</p>

<p>This, however, did not carry us much further towards
the Kasbah, for when within an ace of gaining its walls,
another body of Arabs swept across the great square
with its clump of date-palms, and with cries of rage
attacked us vigorously with rifle and sword. The
combat again became terrible, and in it I received from
a big, raw-boned Arab a severe sword-cut over the left
wrist that caused me excruciating pain. Still I fought
on, although half fearing that our expedition was ill-fated.
We had believed Samory's capital practically
denuded of troops, and of such strenuous opposition as
that offered we had never dreamed.</p>

<p>But the assertion of the West Coast tribes that the
soldiers of the mystic land of Mo know not fear is
certainly true, for never once did they falter, although
the citadel seemed absolutely unassailable by reason of
the fierceness and strength of its defence.</p>

<p>Through the dark night hours we had fought on
revengefully, and when dawn spread the grey glimmering
light disclosed the terrible result of the deadly fray.
Dead and wounded lay everywhere, and through the
suffocating smoke the fire of the rifles now seemed
yellow where in the darkness it had appeared blood-red.
By some means the Arabs rallied their forces, and I
confess that the sight of the overwhelming numbers
opposing us caused my courage to fail. Swiftly and
unrelentlessly the attack upon us was delivered, and
with such vigour that our van fell back, weak and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271"></a>[<a href="./images/271.png">271</a>]</span>
decimated. Suddenly, without warning, a sound above
the din broke upon our ears, startling us.</p>

<p>The rapid cackling was unmistakable, and involuntarily
I burst into a good old-fashioned English cheer.
One of our Maxims had been tardily brought into play!</p>

<p>Ere a few moments had elapsed the Arabs, having
already had a taste of the terrible effect of the deadly
weapon during the recent campaign against the French
and English, stood panic-stricken. Their hesitation
proved fatal. Under the hail of lead they were mowed
down, and ere the remainder could recover from their
astonishment a second weapon was brought into play,
riddling their ranks with showers of death-dealing
missiles.</p>

<h3>THE HAREM SLAVE.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">A Dozen</span> times were we driven back by overwhelming
numbers of Arabs, but as many times we dashed forward
again, determined to strike a fatal, irrisistible blow at the
power of the egotistical and fanatical chieftain whose
depredations had earned for him the appelation of "The
Pirate of the Niger." Every nation in Western Africa,
save the dwellers in the mystic land of Mo, existed in
daily fear of raids by his ruthless armed bands, who,
travelling rapidly across desert and forest, devastated
whole regions, seizing cattle, laying waste prosperous
and fertile districts, burning towns and villages, and
reducing their weaker neighbours to slavery. Indeed,
no bodies of armed men throughout the whole of the
great African continent, including even the Tuaregs,
were so reckless in their attacks, or so fiendish in their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272"></a>[<a href="./images/272.png">272</a>]</span>
wholesale butchery of those who resented the ruin and
devastation of their homes. It was therefore scarcely
surprising that this brigandish horde, whose power even
European nations failed to break, should throw themselves
into the conflict with reckless enthusiasm, and
repel our attack by the exertion of every muscle.</p>

<p>In point of numbers we were much inferior; our
superiority existed only in our arms. Their old-fashioned
bronze field-pieces, flint-lock pistols and long-barrelled
Arab guns, although deadly weapons in the
hands of such expert shots, proved no match against such
irresistible appliances as the Maxim, the Hotchkiss, or the
modern English-made rifle. This fact very soon became
apparent, for although the fierce battle raged for many
hours, and Samory himself, in yellow robe, and mounted
upon a snow-white stallion, gorgeously caparisoned, could
be seen urging on his hordes to valiant deeds, we nevertheless
everywhere made a firm stand at various points of
vantage, and by no effort were they able to dislodge us.</p>

<p>When the sun rose, red and fiery through the veil of
smoke, the increasing weakness of the defence was
visibly demonstrated by the manner in which the
entrance to the Kasbah was guarded. The great
doors of iron were closed and barred securely, and on
the walls the crimson fezes of the defenders showed
in profusion, but presently Kona, as we drove back the
soldiers of Al-Isl&acirc;m almost for the hundredth time,
shouted the order to storm the citadel. With one accord
we made a mad, reckless rush an instant later, and
carried on by the thousands of my comrades behind, I
found myself slashing to right and left under the high,
sun-blanched walls of the enormous fortress. Kona,
appearing a giant even among his tall Dagombas, gave<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273"></a>[<a href="./images/273.png">273</a>]</span>
one the impression in those critical moments of a
veritable demon, filled as he was with a mad excitement
and knowing that upon the success of our assault
depended the result of the expedition. Towering above
his fellows, his long spear in hand, he seemed to lead a
charmed existence, swaying to and fro among whistling
bullets, whizzing arrows, flashing swords and whirring
spears. His own weapon he dyed in the blood of his
adversaries times without number, for where he struck
he never failed to kill. His aim was unerring, and his
courage that of a lion of his native forest.</p>

<p>In those furious moments I escaped death only by a
miracle. As I dashed forward to seek shelter beneath
the ponderous wall, a tall Arab, with long brown hairy
arms, swung his curved sword high above his head and
brought it down with such force that had I not dodged
him just in time, he would have smashed my skull.
Lowering my rifle quickly till its muzzle almost touched
his flowing garments, I fired, but unfortunately the
bullet passed beneath his arm-pit, and flattened itself
against the wall. Again, muttering some fearful imprecation
in Arabic, he raised his gleaming blade, and,
unable to fire at such close quarters, I was then compelled
to use my rifle to ward off his attack. For an instant
we struggled desperately, when suddenly he gave his
sword a rapid twist, jerking my weapon from my hands
and leaving me unarmed at his mercy.</p>

<p>His features broadened into a brutal grin as, noticing
me fumbling for my pistol, he again raised his razor-edged
Moorish blade, and holding it at arm's length,
gave one vigorous slash at me. Pressed forward towards
him by men engaged in mortal conflict behind me, I
could not evade him, and was about to receive the full<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274"></a>[<a href="./images/274.png">274</a>]</span>
force of what my adversary intended should be a fatal
blow, when suddenly a savage spear struck him full in
the throat, and stuck quivering there.</p>

<p>Instantly his sinewy arm fell, the heavy sword dropped
from his nerveless fingers, and he stumbled backward
and fell to earth like a log.</p>

<p>"Thou art safe, O Master!" a voice cried cheerily
behind me, and turning, I saw that the man who had
thrown his spear and saved my life was Kona.</p>

<p>Shouting an expression of thanks I bent, and, unable
to recover my lost rifle in the frightful <i>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</i>, snatched
up the dead Arab's sword that had so nearly caused
my death, then fought on by my deliverer's side. His
wounds were many, for blood was flowing from cuts
and gashes innumerable in his bare black flesh, yet he
appeared insensible to pain, striving forward, gasping
as he dealt each blow, determined to conquer.</p>

<p>The fight continued with unabated fury&mdash;the bloodshed
was horrible. The open square before the gate of
the Kasbah was transformed into a veritable slaughter-yard,
the stones being slippery with blood, and passage
rendered difficult by the corpses that lay piled everywhere.
At last, however, while engaged in another warm corner,
the shrill, awe-inspiring war cry of the Dagombas again
sounded above the tumult, and turning, I saw that by
some means our men had opened the great gate, and
that they were pouring into the spacious courtyards that
I so well remembered.</p>

<p>Our assault, though fiercely and savagely repelled,
was at last successful. We were entering the stronghold
of Samory, and had achieved a feat that the well-equipped
expeditions of the French and English had
failed to accomplish.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275"></a>[<a href="./images/275.png">275</a>]</span>
The Arabs during the next quarter of an hour
struggled bravely against their adversity and fought with
a dogged courage of which I had not believed them
capable. Soon, however, finding themselves conquered,
they cried for quarter. Had they known the peculiar
temperament of the Dagombas and the soldiers of Mo,
they would never thus have implored mercy. But they
cried out, and some even sank on their knees in the
blood of their dead comrades, uttering piteous appeals.
But the Arabs of Samory had never shown mercy to the
Dagombas or the people of Mo, and consequently our
army, in the first flush of their victory, filled with
the awful lust for blood, treated their cries with jeers,
and as they advanced into court after court within the
great Kasbah walls, they fell upon all they met, armed
or unarmed, men or women, and massacred them where
they stood.</p>

<p>The appeal shouted time after time by Kona to view
our victory in temperate spirit and spare those who submitted,
was disregarded by all in this wholesale savage
butchery. The scene within the Arab chieftain's stronghold
was, alas! far more horrible than any I had witnessed
during the revolt in Mo. Guards, officials and slaves of
Samory's household were indiscriminately put to the
sword, some of the men being hunted into corners and
speared by the Dagombas, while others were forced upon
their knees by the soldiers of Mo and mercilessly decapitated.
The door of the great harem, long ago reputed
to contain a thousand inmates, including slaves, was
burst open, and in those beautiful and luxuriant courts
and chambers the whole of the women were butchered
with a brutality quite as fiendish as any displayed by the
Arabs themselves. The handsome favourites of Samory<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276"></a>[<a href="./images/276.png">276</a>]</span>
in their filmy garments of gold tissue and girdles of
precious stones were dragged by their long tresses from
their hiding places and literally hacked to pieces, their
magnificent and costly jewels being torn from them and
regarded as legitimate loot. Women's death-screams
filled the great courts and corridors; their life-blood
stained the pavements of polished jasper and bespattered
the conquerors. The Dagombas, finding themselves
inside this extensive abode of luxury, where beautiful
fountains shot high into the morning sunlight, sweet-smelling
flowers bloomed everywhere and sensuous
odours from perfuming-pans hung heavily in the air,
seemed suddenly transformed into a demoniac horde
bent upon the most ruthless devastation. They remembered
that times without number had the Sofas of Samory
burnt their villages and towns, and carried hundreds of
their tribesmen away as slaves; they were now seeking
revenge for past wrongs.</p>

<p>As, nauseated by the sight of blood, I witnessed these
awful atrocities, I reflected that the curse of Zomara,
uttered solemnly by Omar when Samory had sold us to
the slave-dealers, had at last fallen upon the Arab
chieftain.</p>

<p>Omar had prophesied the downfall of Samory, and his
utterance was now fulfilled.</p>

<p>Screams, piercing and heart-rending, sounded everywhere,
mingled with the fierce war-shouts of our savage
allies, as, time after time, some unfortunate woman in
gorgeous garb and ablaze with valuable gems was discovered,
dragged unceremoniously from her hiding-place
to the great court wherein I stood, her many necklets
ruthlessly torn from her white throat and a keen sword
drawn across it as a butcher would calmly despatch a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277"></a>[<a href="./images/277.png">277</a>]</span>
lamb. Then, when life had ebbed, her body would be
cast into the great basin of the fountain, where hundreds
of others had already been pitched.</p>

<p>In other parts of the Kasbah a similar massacre was
proceeding, none of those found therein being allowed
to escape; while an active search was everywhere in
progress for Samory himself.</p>

<p>From where I stood I witnessed the breaking up of
the Arab ruler's throne, and the tearing down of the
great canopy of amaranth silk under which Samory had
reclined when, with Omar, I had been brought before him.
The crescent of solid gold that had surmounted it was
handed to Kona, who broke it in half beneath his heel
as sign of the completeness of his victory. Then, when
the destruction of the seat of the brutal autocrat was
complete, the <i>d&eacute;bris</i> with the torn silk, and the long
strips of crimson cloth, whereon good counsels from the
Kor&acirc;n were embroidered in Kufic characters of gold, that
had formed a kind of frieze to the chamber, were carried
out into the court by fifty willing hands, heaped up and
there burnt.</p>

<p>While watching the flames leaping up consuming the
wrecked remains of the royal seat of the powerful Arab
ruler, a woman's scream, louder than the rest, caused me
to look suddenly round at the latest victim of the
Dagombas' thirst for vengeance, and I beheld in the
clutches of half-a-dozen savages, a young woman, dragged
as the others had been by her fair, unbound hair
towards the spot where each had, in turn, been murdered.
She was dressed in a rich, beautiful robe of bright yellow
silk, embroidered with pale pink flowers, but her
garments were bedraggled with water and blood, and
her bleeding wrists and fingers showed with what heart<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278"></a>[<a href="./images/278.png">278</a>]</span>less
brutality her jewels had been torn from her by her
pitiless captors. She struggled frantically to free herself,
but without avail, and one of the savages, noticing a
magnificent diamond bangle upon her ankle, bent, and
tried to force it off.</p>

<p>Just at that moment, in endeavouring to twist herself
free from their clutches, her fair face became turned
towards me and her deep blue, terrified eyes for an
instant met mine.</p>

<p>Next second I uttered a cry of recognition. Yes, there
was no mistake about that flawless complexion, those
handsome features or those wondrous eyes, the mysterious
depths of which had enthralled me, as they had done
Omar.</p>

<p>It was Liola!</p>

<p>With a bound I sprang forward, tearing at the knot of
savages and shouting to them to release her. At first
they only grinned hideously, no doubt thinking that I
desired her as a slave, and as they had decided that all
should die without exception, in order that their conquest
should be rendered the more complete, they were in no
way disposed to obey my command. At last I succeeded
in arresting their progress, when the man who had
attempted to wrench from her ankle the diamond ornament
shook his long, keen knife threateningly at me,
while the others yelled all kinds of imprecations. Not
liking his fierce attitude, and knowing that in the heat of
victory they were capable of turning upon friends who
attempted to thwart them, I drew back, and as I did so
he flung himself upon one knee and raised his knife over
Liola's foot.</p>

<p>Instantly I saw his intention. He meant to hack off
her foot in order to secure the bangle, a horrible pro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279"></a>[<a href="./images/279.png">279</a>]</span>ceeding
that had been carried out more than once before
my eyes within the past hour. There was, I knew, but
one way to save her, therefore without hesitating I drew
my revolver and fired at him point blank.</p>

<p>The ball pierced his breast. With an agonized cry he
clutched for a moment wildly at the air, then fell back dead.</p>

<p>My action, as I fully expected it would, aroused the
intense ire of his companions and all released Liola, now
insensible, and sprang at me, their ready knives flashing
in the sunlight. I was compelled to fly, and had it not
been for Kona, who, standing some distance off watching
the reduction of Samory's throne to ashes, took in the
situation at a glance, sped in their direction, and ordered
his men to stop and tell him the cause, I should undoubtedly
have lost my life. As their head-man his
word was law. Then, glancing at the inanimate form
of Liola, who, having fainted, had been left lying on the
blood-stained pavement, he recognized her as Goliba's
daughter, and in a dozen words told his men that she
was the betrothed of the young Naba of Mo, and that
I, his friend, had saved her.</p>

<p>The savages, aghast at this statement, and recognizing
how near they had been to murdering the beloved of
the Naba Omar, rushed towards me penitent, urging
that they might be forgiven, and declaring that their
conduct, under the circumstances, was excusable. They
had, they said, no idea that they would find in the harem
of their enemy Samory the betrothed of Mo's ruler, and
I also was compelled to admit myself quite as astounded
as themselves. Therefore in brief words explanations
and forgiveness were exchanged and I rushed across, and
with the ready help of Kona and his men endeavoured
to restore her to consciousness.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280"></a>[<a href="./images/280.png">280</a>]</span>
The dread of her horrible fate had caused her to faint,
and it was a long time ere we could bring her back to
the knowledge of her surroundings. Tenderly the
Dagombas, who a few minutes before would have
brutally murdered her, carried her into one of the small
luxuriantly-furnished chambers of the harem, and at my
request left me alone with her. Kona, though fierce
as a wild beast in war, was tender-hearted as a child
where undefended women were concerned, and would
have remained, but as commander of the forces now
engaged in sacking the palace many onerous duties
devolved upon him. Therefore I was left alone with her.</p>

<p>Her eyes closed, her fair hair disarranged, her clothing
torn and blood-stained, she lay upon a soft divan, pale
and motionless as one dead. I chafed her tiny hands,
and released her rich robe at the throat to give her
air, wondering by what strange chain of circumstances
she had come to be an inmate of the private apartments
of our enemy Samory. At last, however, her breast
heaved and fell slowly once or twice, and presently she
opened her beautiful eyes, gazing up at me with a
puzzled, half-frightened expression.</p>

<p>"Liola," I exclaimed softly, in the language of Mo.
"Thou art with friends, have no further fear. The
soldiers of thy lover Omar have wreaked a vengeance
complete and terrible upon thy captor Samory."</p>

<p>"But the savages!" she gasped. "They will kill me
as they massacred all the women."</p>

<p>"No, no, they will not," I assured her, placing my
arm tenderly beneath her handsome head. "The
savages are our Dagomba allies who, not knowing that
thou wert a native of Mo, would have butchered thee like
the rest."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281"></a>[<a href="./images/281.png">281</a>]</span>
"And thou didst save me?" she cried. "Yes, I
remember, thou didst shoot dead the brute who would
have cut off my foot to secure my diamond anklet. I
owe my life to thee."</p>

<p>"Ah! do not speak of that," I cried. "Calm thyself
and rest assured of thy safety, for thou shalt return with
us to the land of thy fathers. Thou shalt, ere a moon
has run its course, pillow thine head upon the shoulder
of the man thou lovest, Omar, Naba of Mo."</p>

<p>She blushed deeply at my words, and her small white
hand still smeared with blood, gripped my wrist. Her
heart seemed too full for words, and in this manner she
silently thanked me for rescuing her from the awful fate
to which she had so nearly been hurried.</p>

<p>Soon she recovered from the shock sufficiently to sit
up and chat. Together we listened to the roar of the
excited multitude outside, and from the lattice window
could see columns of dense black smoke rising from the
city, where the fighting-men of Mo, in accordance with
their instructions from Omar, having sacked the place,
were now setting it on fire.</p>

<p>In answer to my eager questions as to her adventures
after her seizure by the soldiers of the Great White
Queen, she said:</p>

<p>"Yes. It is true they captured me, together with my
girl slave, Wyona, and hurried me towards the palace.
Wyona fought and bit like a tigress, and one of the men
becoming infuriated, killed her. Just at that moment the
attack was made upon us by the populace, and they,
witnessing his action, tore him limb from limb. Then,
in the fierce conflict that followed, I escaped from their
clutches in the same manner as Omar and thyself.
Knowing of the attack to be made upon the palace I fled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282"></a>[<a href="./images/282.png">282</a>]</span>
for safety in the opposite direction, and remained in
hiding throughout the night in the house of one of my
kinswomen away towards the city-gate. At last the
report spread that the people had taken the palace by
assault, the Naya had been deposed, and Omar enthroned
Naba in her stead. Then, feeling that safety was assured,
I ventured forth, but ere I had gone far I met a body of
strange fighting men. They were Arabs, and proved to
be men from this stronghold of our enemy Samory.
After a strenuous attempt to cross the city they had been
repulsed by the people, leaving many dead, and in their
retreat towards the city-gate they seized me and bore me
away in triumph here."</p>

<p>"How long hast thou been in Koussan?"</p>

<p>"Twenty days ago we arrived, after fighting our way
back and losing half our force in skirmishes with the
hostile savages of the forest. I was brought here to
Samory's harem as slave, attired in the garments I now
wear, loaded with jewels torn from the body of one of
his favourites, who, incurring his displeasure, had been
promptly strangled by the chief of the negro eunuchs,
and placed in an apartment with three other slaves to
do my bidding, there to await such time as it should
please my Arab captor to inspect me. I was contemplating
death," she added, dropping her deep blue
eyes. "If your attack upon the Kasbah had not been
delivered I should most assuredly have killed myself
to-day ere the going down of the sun."</p>

<p>"It was fortunate that I recognized thee, or thou
wouldst have been hacked to pieces by the keen blades
of our savage allies," I said.</p>

<p>"Take me hence," she urged panting. "I cannot bear
to hear the shout of the victor and the despairing cry of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283"></a>[<a href="./images/283.png">283</a>]</span>
the vanquished. It is horrible. Throughout the night we,
in the women's quarters, have dreaded the fate awaiting
us if the invaders, whom we thought were savages of the
forest, should gain the mastery and enter the palace.
From the high windows yonder we witnessed the fight,
knowing that our lives depended upon its issue, and judge
our dismay and despair when, soon after dawn, we saw
the Arabs overwhelmed and the Kasbah fall into the hands
of their conquerors. Many of my wretched companions
killed themselves with their poignards rather than fall
into the hands of the blacks, while the majority hid
themselves only to be afterwards discovered and
butchered. Ah, it is all terrible, terrible!"</p>

<p>"True," I answered. "Yet it is only revenge for the
depredations and heartless atrocities committed by these
people upon the dwellers in thy border lands. Even at
this moment Samory hath a great expedition on the
northern confines of Mo, making a vigorous attempt to
invade thy country, so that he shall reign upon the
Emerald Throne in the place of thy lover Omar."</p>

<p>"An expedition to invade Mo?" she cried surprised.
"Hath Samory done this; is it his intention to cause
Omar's overthrow?"</p>

<p>"Most assuredly it is," I answered. "The reason
of our presence here in such force was to assault Koussan
in the absence of its picked troops, twenty thousand of
whom were we ascertained on their way northward, with
the intention of forcing a passage through Aribanda
and the Hombori Mountains into Mo. Niaro hath led
our fighting-men to repel their attack, and he is accompanied
by Omar and thy father, while we are here, under
Kona's leadership, to punish Samory for his intrepidity."</p>

<p>Then she asked how Omar fared, and I explained how<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284"></a>[<a href="./images/284.png">284</a>]</span>
it had been believed that she had died, and that all were
mourning for her.</p>

<p>"My slave Wyona must have been mistaken for me,"
she answered. "And naturally, as I had given her one
of my left-off robes only the day before."</p>

<p>"Omar believeth thee dead. Thy presence in Mo will
indeed bring happiness to his eyes, and gaiety to his
heart," I exclaimed happily.</p>

<p>"Doth he still mourn for me?" she inquired artlessly.
I knew she wanted to ask me many questions regarding
her lover, but her modesty forbade it.</p>

<p>"Since the fatal night when thou wert lost joy hath
never caused a smile to cross his countenance. Sleeping
and waking he thinketh only of thee, revering thy
memory, reflecting upon the happy moments spent at
thy side, as one fondly remembers a pleasant dream or
adventures in some fair paradise, yet ever sad in the
knowledge that those blissful days can never return. His
is an empty honour, a kingship devoid of all pleasure
because thou art no longer his."</p>

<p>Her lips trembled slightly, and I thought her brilliant
eyes became brighter for a moment because of an unshed
tear.</p>

<p>"I am still his," she said slowly, with emphasis. "I
am ready, nay anxious, to return to him. Thou hast
saved me from death and from dishonour; truly thou
art a worthy friend of Omar's, for by thy valiant deed
alone thou restorest unto him the woman he loveth."</p>

<p>I urged her to utter no word of thanks, and pointing
to the sky, rendered every moment more dark by the increasing
volumes of smoke ascending from the city, said:</p>

<p>"See! Our men are busy preparing for the
destruction of this palace that through many centuries<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285"></a>[<a href="./images/285.png">285</a>]</span>
hath been a centre of Mohammedan influence and
oppression. Time doth not admit of thanks, for we both
have much to do ere we start forth on our return to Mo,
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>My words were interrupted by a terrific explosion in
such close proximity to us that it caused us to jump, and
was followed by a deafening crash of falling masonry.
From the lattice we saw the high handsome minaret of
the palace topple and fall amid a dense smoke and shower
of stones. Our men had undermined it and blown it up.</p>

<p>Liola shuddered, glancing at me in alarm.</p>

<p>"Fear not," I said. "Ere we leave, the city of
Koussan must be devastated and burned. Samory hath
never given quarter, or shown mercy to his weaker
neighbours, and we will show none. Besides, he held
thee captive as he hath already held thy lover Omar and
myself. He sold us to slavers that we might be sacrificed
in Kumassi, therefore the curse of thy Crocodile-god
Zomara placed upon him hath at last fallen. The
flood-gates of vengeance now opened the hand of man
cannot close."</p>

<p>The great court of the harem, deserted by the troops,
had become filled with volumes of dense smoke, showing
that fire had broken out somewhere within the
palace, and ever and anon explosions of a more or less
violent character told us that the hands of the destroyers
were actually at work. The sack of the Kasbah was
indeed complete.</p>

<p>The loot, of which there was an enormous quantity of
considerable value, was being removed to a place of safety
by a large body of men told off for the purpose.
Although Samory was a fugitive, yet the treasures found
within his private apartments were of no mean order, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286"></a>[<a href="./images/286.png">286</a>]</span>
ere noon had passed preparations were being made for
its conveyance to Mo, the greater part of the city
being already in flames. The fire roared and crackled,
choking smoke-clouds obscured the sun, and the heat
wafted up was stifling. All opposition to us had long
ago ceased, but whenever an Arab was found secreted
or a fugitive, he was shot down without mercy. To
linger longer in the harem might, I judged, be dangerous
on account of the place having been fired, therefore we
went together out into the court, and stepping over the
mutilated bodies of its beautiful prisoners, entered the
chamber where Samory had held his court. Empty,
dismantled and wrecked, its appearance showed plainly
how the mighty monarch had fallen. Even the great
bejewelled manuscript of the Kor&acirc;n, the Arab book of
Everlasting Will, that had reposed upon its golden
stand at the end of the fine, high-roofed chamber, had
been torn up, for its leaves lay scattered about the
pavement and after the jewels had been hastily dug
from their settings, the covers of green velvet had been
cast aside as worthless. Every seat or divan had been
either broken or slashed by swords, every vessel or mirror
smashed, every ornament damaged beyond repair.</p>

<p>Thinking it best to leave her, a woman, in care of a
guard of our armed men, while I went forward, I made
the suggestion, but she would not hear of it.</p>

<p>"No," she answered smiling. "I will remain ever at
thy side, for beside thee I fear not. Thou art my
rescuer, and my life is thine."</p>

<p>"But some of the sights we may witness are not
such as a woman's eyes should behold," I answered.</p>

<p>"It mattereth not. That thou wilt allow me to accompany
thee, is all I ask."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287"></a>[<a href="./images/287.png">287</a>]</span>
"Very well," I replied, laughing. "Thou art welcome.
Come."</p>

<p>By my side she hurried through the chamber wherein
had stood the throne, and thence through several handsome
courts, wandering at last into another smaller
chamber at the side of which I noticed an alcove with
a huge Arab bed surrounded by quaint lattices, so dark
that my gaze could not penetrate to its recesses.</p>

<p>As we passed, the movement of some object in the
deep shadow beside the bed attracted my attention.
Advancing quickly I detected the figure of a man, and,
fearing a sudden dash by one of our lurking foes, I again
drew my sword.</p>

<p>Liola, seeing this, gave vent to a little scream of
alarm and placed her hand upon my arm in fear, but
next second the fugitive, anticipating my intention to
attack him, sprang suddenly forward into the light.</p>

<p>The bearded face, the fierce, flashing eyes, the thick
lips and bushy brows were all familiar to me. Although
he wore the white cotton garb of the meanest slave, I
recognised him in an instant.</p>

<p>It was the great Arab chieftain Samory!</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXXIV.</h2>

<h3>LIOLA'S DISCOVERY.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">With</span> a sudden bound I left Liola's side and sprang
upon the leader of our enemies, clutching him fiercely
by the throat and shouting for assistance. No one was,
however, near, and for a few moments we struggled
desperately. He was unarmed, and I, having unfortunately
dropped my sword in the encounter, our conflict
resolved itself into a fierce wrestle for the possession of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288"></a>[<a href="./images/288.png">288</a>]</span>
the weapon which must give victory to the one into
whose hands it fell. Once Samory, wiry and muscular
like all Arabs, notwithstanding his age, stooped swiftly
in an endeavour to snatch up the blade, but seeing his
intention, my fingers tightened their grip upon his
throat, and he was compelled to spring up again without
obtaining possession of the weapon. For several
minutes our struggle was desperate, for he had managed
to pinion my arms, and I knew that ere long I must be
powerless, his strength being far superior to my own.</p>

<p>Liola screamed for help, but no one seemed within
call, when suddenly the thought seemed to suggest
itself to her to snatch up my weapon and hold it.</p>

<p>I turned to take it from her, but by this action my
grip upon my Arab foe became released, and with a
desperate spring he forced himself from my grasp,
bounding away, leaving a portion of his white <i>jibbeh</i>
in my hand. But, determined that he should not
escape, I dashed after him headlong across the chamber,
and out by the opposite door. In the court beyond
a knot of our soldiers were standing discussing the
events of the day, and I shouted to them; but the
sight of me chasing a single fugitive slave did not appeal
to them, and they disregarded my order to arrest his
progress. Nevertheless I kept on, feeling assured that
sooner or later I must run him to earth, but never
thinking of the intricacies with which all such palaces
abound, intricacies which must be well-known to the
Mohammedan ruler.</p>

<p>Suddenly, after endeavouring to elude me by ingenious
devices innumerable, and always finding himself frustrated,
he entered a chamber leading from the Court of
the Eunuchs, and had gained on me sufficiently to dis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289"></a>[<a href="./images/289.png">289</a>]</span>appear
ere I reached the entrance. I rushed through
after him, believing that he had crossed the deserted
court beyond, but was surprised to find that I had
utterly lost him. I halted to listen, but could hear no
footsteps, and after a careful examination of all the
outlets, presently returned in chagrin to the chamber
into which he had suddenly dashed, before escaping.</p>

<p>Standing in its centre I looked wonderingly around.
Then, for the first time, I discovered that our soldiers,
obeying their instructions, had been pouring inflammable
liquids everywhere throughout the Kasbah, and
a great burst of blood-red flame in the outer court told
me that the place had been ignited. At that moment,
Liola, with white scared face, believing that she had
lost me, entered the chamber, but I recognized our
imminent peril, surrounded as we were by a belt of fire.</p>

<p>"Fly!" I cried, frantically. "Fly! quick, back
across yonder court to save thy life! In a few moments
I will join thee. I must examine this chamber ere I
depart."</p>

<p>"I will not go without thee," she answered with calm
decision.</p>

<p>"Why riskest thou thy life?" I cried in excitement.
"Fly, or in a moment it may be too late, we may both
be overwhelmed or suffocated."</p>

<p>But she stirred not. She stood by me in silence,
gazing in fear at the red roaring flames that, raging
outside, now cut off our retreat by either door. The
cause of my hesitation to rush away at first sight of the
flames, was the suspicion that somewhere in that chamber
was a secret exit. The sudden manner in which the
Arab chieftain had eluded me could only have been
accomplished by such means. The chamber, well<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290"></a>[<a href="./images/290.png">290</a>]</span>
furnished and supported by three great twisted columns
of milk-white marble, had its floor covered with costly
rugs and its walls hung with dark red hangings, bearing
strange devices and inscriptions in long thin Arabic
characters. Few rooms in the Kasbah were decorated
in this manner, and it had instantly occurred to me
that, concealed somewhere, was one of those secret
ways which, whether in the Oriental palace, or the
medi&aelig;val European castle, are so suggestive of treachery
and intrigue.</p>

<p>Although one horse-shoe arch of the place led into
the Court of the Eunuchs, the other, I noticed, was
in direct communication with Samory's private apartments.
With consummate skill he had led me here by
such a circuitous route that I had not at first noticed
that it joined a kind of ante-room to his pavilion.</p>

<p>But the roaring flames that every moment leaped
nearer, crackling furiously and fanning us with their
scorching breath, allowed me no time for further reflection.
Escape was now entirely cut off; only by
discovering the secret exit could we save ourselves. In
breathless haste I rushed around the walls, tapping them
with my sword; but such action proved useless, as I
could hear nothing above the roaring and crackling on
either side. With my hands I tried to discover where
the door was concealed, rushing from side to side in
frantic despair, but the exit, wherever it existed, was too
cunningly hidden.</p>

<p>So dense had the smoke become that we could not
see across the chamber; tongues of fire had ignited the
heavy silken hangings, and the whole interior was alight
from end to end.</p>

<p>"We are lost&mdash;lost!" shrieked Liola in despair<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291"></a>[<a href="./images/291.png">291</a>]</span>
"We have fallen victims to our own terrible vengeance
upon our enemies."</p>

<p>Within myself I was compelled to admit this, for it
seemed as though Samory had led us into a veritable
death-trap that the soldiers of Mo had themselves
prepared. Suddenly, as a last chance, I remembered
I had not examined the three great marble columns,
each of such circumference that a man could not
embrace them in his arms. I dashed forward, and in
the blinding smoke, that caused my eyes to water and
held my chest contracted, I tried to investigate whether
they were what they appeared to be, solid and substantial
supports. The first was undoubtedly fashioned
out of a single block of stone, the lower portion
polished by the thousands of people who during
many centuries had brushed past it. The second
was exactly similar, and the third also. But the latter
seemed more chipped and worn than the others, and
just as I was about to abandon all hope I made a sudden
discovery that thrilled me with joy. As I grasped it
a portion of it fell back, disclosing that the column was
hollow.</p>

<p>The hole was just sufficient to admit the passage of
one's body, and without an instant's hesitation I drew
Liola forward, and urged her to get inside. The flames
were now lapping about us, and another moment's
delay would mean certain death. Therefore she dashed
in, and as she did so sank quickly out of sight, while
the portion of the marble column closed again with a
snap.</p>

<p>The rapidity with which she disappeared astounded
me, the more so, when, after the lapse of about a minute
the platform whereon she had stepped rose again, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292"></a>[<a href="./images/292.png">292</a>]</span>
with a click returned to its place. Only then was I
enabled to re-open the cavity. Apparently it worked
automatically, and being balanced in some way, as soon
as Liola had stepped off it, had risen again. Instantly
I stepped upon it, and with hands close to my sides,
sank so swiftly into the darkness that the wind whistled
through my garments and roared in my ears. The
descent was, I judged, about two hundred feet, but in
the pitch darkness I could not discern the character of
the shaft. Of a sudden with a jerk it stopped, and
finding myself in a strange dimly-lit chamber bricked
like a vault, with Liola standing awaiting me, I stepped
off, and as I did so the platform shot up again into its
place.</p>

<p>"We have, at all events, escaped being burned alive,"
my fair companion exclaimed when she recovered
breath. "But this place is weird and dismal enough."</p>

<p>"True," I answered. "There must, however, be
some exit, or Samory would not have entered it. We
must explore and discover it."</p>

<p>Glancing around the mysterious vault I saw burning
in a niche, with a supply of oil sufficient to last several
weeks, a single lamp that had apparently always been
kept alight. Taking it up I led the way through the
long narrow chamber. The walls, blackened by damp,
were covered with great grey fungi, while lizards and
other reptiles scuttled from our path into the darkness.
At the further end, the vault narrowed into a passage so
low that we were compelled to stoop when entering it.
In this burrow, the ramifications of which were extraordinary,
Liola's filmy garments came to sad grief, for
catching upon the projecting portions of rock, they
were rent from time to time, while the loss of one of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293"></a>[<a href="./images/293.png">293</a>]</span>
her little green slippers necessitated some delay in
recovering it. Yet groping along the narrow uneven
way in search of some exit, we at length came into a
larger chamber, bricked like the others, and as we
entered it were startled by a sudden unearthly roar.</p>

<p>We both drew back, and Liola, in fear, clutched my
arm.</p>

<p>"Listen!" she gasped. "What was that?"</p>

<p>Again the noise was repeated, causing the low-roofed
chamber to echo, and as I peered forward into the
darkness, my gaze was transfixed by a pair of gleaming
fiery eyes straight before us.</p>

<p>Similar noises I had heard in the forest on many
occasions, and the startling truth at once flashed across
my mind. Confronting us was a lion!</p>

<p>I stood in hesitation, not knowing how to act, while
Liola clung to me, herself detecting the gleaming eyes
and being fully aware of our peril. Yet scarcely a
moment passed ere there was a loud rushing sound in
the darkness, and the animal, with a low growl, flew
through the air in our direction. We had no time to
elude him, but fortunately he seemed to have misjudged
his distance, for he alighted about half-a-dozen paces
short of us. So close was his head that the two
gleaming orbs seemed to be rivetted to us. We felt his
breath, and unable to draw back, we feared that each
second must be our last.</p>

<p>Next moment I heard a clanking of chains, a sound
that gave me instant courage.</p>

<p>"Hark!" I cried joyously. "At present we are safe,
for the brute is chained!"</p>

<p>Such we ascertained a few minutes later was actually
the case, and as I stood there, lamp in hand, my foot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294"></a>[<a href="./images/294.png">294</a>]</span>
struck something. Glancing down I saw it was a human
thigh-bone. The animal had already tasted the blood
of man, and, straining at his chain, was furious to spring
upon us. I then became puzzled to know the reason
why this fierce king of the forest should be kept in
captivity at this depth if not to guard some entrance or
exit. For a few moments I reflected, and at length
arrived at the conclusion that during our progress we
had slowly ascended towards the earth's surface, and that
through the lion's den was the exit of that subterranean
way. Again, we had neither seen nor heard sign of the
fugitive chieftain. By some means or other he must
have succeeded in passing the ferocious brute, and if he
had accomplished it, we surely could also.</p>

<p>With my words half drowned by the continuous roar
of the fiery-eyed guardian of the secret burrow, I explained
briefly to Liola the result of my reflections, and
then set about to ascertain the length of the chain
holding the animal. After several experiments, allowing
it to spring forward at me half-a-dozen times and
narrowly escaping its ponderous paws more than once,
I ascertained that the chain was just short enough to
allow a person to cross the chamber flattened against the
opposite wall.</p>

<p>Holding the lamp still in my hand and urging Liola
to brace her nerves and watch me closely, I essayed the
attempt, creeping cautiously with my back against the
roughly-hewn side of the underground lair, and drawing
my garments about me to prevent them being hooked
by the cruel claws that followed me within a yard during
the whole distance. Before my eyes the big shaggy
head wagged continuously, the great jaws with their
terrible teeth opened, emitting terrific roars of rage and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295"></a>[<a href="./images/295.png">295</a>]</span>
closed again with a dull ominous click, while the chain
was strained until I feared it might be rent asunder.</p>

<p>Through several minutes mine was a most horrible
experience, for I knew not whether the wall was even;
if not, I must have fallen beneath the ferocious claws.
However, I managed to successfully cross the brute's
den, and shouting to Liola that the passage was perfectly
safe, providing she kept her garments closely about her
and did not remove her back from the wall, held up the
light to her.</p>

<p>With reassuring words she commenced to follow my
example, and when the brute saw me in safety and
noticed her approach, he left me and sprang towards
her. But again he fell short, almost strangled by the
pressure upon the iron collar that held him. With an
awful roar, his jaws snapping in rage, and his paws
constantly clutching at her, he followed her closely just
as he had followed me. I feared that she might
suddenly faint from the terrible strain upon her nerves,
but having witnessed my safe passage she preserved a
calmness that was amazing. Twice as the animal, after
crouching, leapt suddenly forward I feared the chain must
give way, but beyond a low frightened scream escaping
her, she preserved a cool demeanour, and a few moments
later I was gratified to find her standing panting but
unharmed at my side.</p>

<p>"There is an exit somewhere near," I exclaimed a
moment later, while she rearranged her torn, blood-stained
garments and smoothed her hair with her hands.
"Come, let us search."</p>

<p>On proceeding we soon found ourselves in a small
passage, drier than the former, and descending rather
steeply for some distance, suddenly entered another<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296"></a>[<a href="./images/296.png">296</a>]</span>
spacious chamber hewn from the solid rock. Immediately
we were inside some peculiarity of its walls attracted
my gaze, and I noticed, in addition, that we were in a
<i>cul-de-sac</i>.</p>

<p>There was, after all, no exit!</p>

<p>The rocky walls, however, rivetted the attention of
both of us, for let into them at frequent intervals were
large square plates of iron. These I examined carefully,
quickly arriving at the conclusion that they had been
placed there to close up hewn cavities. With this
opinion, Liola, assisting me in my investigations, fully
agreed. Each plate, looking curiously like the door of
an oven, had apparently been fitted deeply into grooves
sunk in the hard rock, for although I tried one after the
other, seeking to remove them, they would not budge.
By tapping upon them I ascertained that they were of
great thickness, and I judged that each must weigh
several hundredweight. They were not doors, for they
had no hinges, yet beneath each one was a small semi-circular
hole in the iron into which I could just thrust
my little finger. These were certainly not key-holes, but
rather, it seemed, intended to admit air.</p>

<p>In the course of our eager investigations we suddenly
came upon a great pile of strongly-bound loads, each
wrapped in untanned cow-hide and bound tightly with
wire. From their battered appearance they had evidently
rested upon the heads of carriers throughout a long
march.</p>

<p>"I wonder what they contain?" Liola exclaimed, as
we both looked down upon them.</p>

<p>"Let us see," I said. Handing her the lamp, I knelt
upon one of the packages, and after considerable trouble
succeeded in unbinding the wire. Then as I tore away<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297"></a>[<a href="./images/297.png">297</a>]</span>
its thick covering, we both uttered cries of amazement.
The sight that met our gaze was bewildering.</p>

<p>From the package there rolled out into the dust a profusion
of magnificent glittering jewels.</p>

<p>"Ah! What diamonds!" Liola cried, with admiration
for the iridescent stones that was particularly feminine.
Then, picking up a splendid bracelet and slipping it
upon her wrist, she added, "Look! Isn't this marvellous?
The gems are larger than I have ever before
seen."</p>

<p>"Beautiful!" I cried gleefully, for by sheer good
fortune we had discovered Samory's hidden treasure, and
I reflected that our conquest would be rendered absolutely
complete by its removal in triumph to Mo.</p>

<p>After a cursory examination of the first pack we
together undid them one after another, eagerly investigating
their glistening contents, and finding them to
consist of a collection of the most wonderful and valuable
precious stones it was possible to conceive. There were
a few heavy gold ornaments of antique pattern, but in
most of them jewels were set, and those only of the most
antique and magnificent character. Every known gem
was there represented by specimens larger, and of far
purer water, than my eyes had ever before beheld. Upon
her knees, Liola, with a cry of pleasure, plunged both
hands into the glittering heap of jewels, drawing out one
after another and holding them up to the glimmering
light, her bright eyes full of admiration. The examination
of nearly forty great packages took us a long time,
but so fascinating proved our task that we were heedless
of how the hours sped in our determination to ascertain
the true extent of our discovery.</p>

<p>While still upon her knees I had opened almost the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298"></a>[<a href="./images/298.png">298</a>]</span>
last package and spread it before her, when, with a
sudden ejaculation she withdrew a magnificent necklet of
emeralds of huge size in quaint ancient settings, and with
a gay laugh held it up to me for a moment, then clasped
it about her own white neck. In the centre hung a
pendant consisting of a single emerald of enormous size
and brilliant lustre, and as I regarded it in the half light,
its shape struck me as distinctly curious. I snatched up
the lamp, and bending, examined the quaintly-cut gem
more minutely. Then, next instant, I cried excitedly:</p>

<p>"See! The shape of the pendant proves the origin of
the necklet!"</p>

<p>With a quick movement she tore it off and looked.
Then, in amazement, she gasped:</p>

<p>"It is a representation of Zomara, our god!"</p>

<p>We both scrutinized it closely. Yes, there was no
mistake, the emerald had been fashioned into the form
of a perfect crocodile, with open jaws, even the teeth
being finely chiselled, a veritable marvel of the lapidary's
art. While we were both looking at it puzzled, Liola's
eyes suddenly became attracted by sight of something in
the package I had just opened, and stooping swiftly,
picked out of a mass of ornaments a magnificent diadem
of some strange milk-coloured, opaque crystals of a
character entirely strange to me. The stones were
beautifully cut and polished, and although they glittered,
even in the sickly rays of our lamp, they had no transparency.</p>

<p>"Behold!" she cried in a voice full of awe, her clear
eyes wide open in astonishment. "See what we have
discovered!"</p>

<p>I gazed at it, failing at first to notice what I afterwards
recognised.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299"></a>[<a href="./images/299.png">299</a>]</span>
"It is a crown," I said laughing. "A crown fit to
grace thy brow!"</p>

<p>"It is the great Rock Diadem of the Sanoms of Mo!"
she answered. "See! It is surmounted by the vampire,
our national emblem!"</p>

<p>Then, I saw that upon the crest of the diadem was a
single great diamond wonderfully chiselled to represent
a bat with outspread wings, the device upon the banners
of the mystic realm.</p>

<p>"This," she continued, "is without doubt the historic
crown of the first Naya. Though it hath never been
seen for ages by the eyes of man, it was always popularly
supposed to be preserved in the secret Treasure-house
of the Sanoms, among the royal jewels. Many are the
beliefs and superstitions regarding it. The stones are
said to be the first pieces of rock chipped during the
foundation of our City in the Clouds, which, as thou art
aware, was her work a thousand years ago. Among the
possessions of our royal house no relic hath been more
venerated than this Rock Diadem of the Naya. How
it came hither I know not. It is assuredly a mystery."</p>

<p>"No," I answered, endeavouring to subdue my excitement.
"We have now elucidated the mystery. The
Treasure-house of Mo hath been entered by thieves, and
the most valuable of the royal treasures stolen. The
matter hath been kept secret from the people, but by our
discovery the identity of the robbers is established
beyond doubt, and we have thus recovered the wealth of
a nation that was believed to be irretrievably lost."</p>

<p>"But is all of this Omar's lost treasure?" she
inquired, astounded at my statement, glancing at the huge
heap of gold and jewels nearly as high as ourselves, and of
such great value as to be utterly beyond computation.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300"></a>[<a href="./images/300.png">300</a>]</span>
"Without doubt," I answered, stooping and picking
up several jewelled trinkets, girdles and other ornaments,
each bearing the sacred reptile or the vampire crest of
royalty. "The recovery of these will, at least repay thy
nation for the expedition sent against their enemy.
Retain possession of the Rock Diadem of Mo, for thou
hast discovered it, and with thine own hands shalt thou
deliver it into the possession of the ruler who loveth
thee."</p>

<p>Then, carefully wrapping the ancient badge of regal
dignity in a piece of hide and binding it securely with
wire as the carriers' loads had been, I gave it back to
her. In half an hour we had completed our examination
of the wondrous accumulation of treasure, finding
among it many quaint and extraordinary ornaments,
some no doubt dating from the earlier days of the
foundation of the mysterious isolated kingdom, and
others manufactured during recent centuries. The
gems were unique in size and character. Truly the
thieves in the employ of the Arab chief had taken care
to secure the most valuable portion of the royal jewels
and leave behind only those of least worth.</p>

<p>With the secret of their concealment in our possession
we were both full of eagerness to get back to the light
of day and take steps for their removal, yet I confess
that the mystery of what was contained behind those
strange plates of iron puzzled me.</p>

<p>Leaving Liola to continue her inspection of our
discovered treasures, I crossed to the wall and examined
one of the plates again, trying with both hands to force
it out, but being compelled to relinquish the attempt as
hopeless. I was about to give up all idea of discovering
how they might be opened, when Liola suddenly uttered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301"></a>[<a href="./images/301.png">301</a>]</span>
an exclamation, and in turning to glance at her, the
flame of the lamp I held came into contact with the
wall close to the plate that had defied my exertions to
remove it.</p>

<p>In an instant a bright flash ran around the chamber,
lighting it up as bright as day; a puff of grey smoke
was belched in our faces, and a report like thunder
deafened us.</p>

<p>An explosion had occurred, great pieces of rock and
other <i>d&eacute;bris</i> being flung in all directions.</p>

<p>Its terrific force hurled me heavily against the wall,
while Liola was flung face downward upon the pile of
jewels. Fortunately, neither of us sustained any injury
beyond a few bruises, but when I had assisted her to
rise, and gazed around, I was amazed to discover that a
strange thing had occurred. The whole of the iron
plates had been torn from their sockets, and a dark
cavity behind each disclosed.</p>

<p>The small sealed cells had been wrenched open simultaneously,
as if by a miracle.</p>

<p>But upon careful examination there was, I found,
nothing miraculous in the manner in which they had
thus been forced. The suffocating smoke that filled the
place was of itself sufficient evidence of the agent to
which the explosion had been due, and when I looked
at the first cavity I saw that right around the chamber,
from plate to plate, there had been laid a train of
gunpowder, communicating with a charge of powder
placed behind each of the semi-circular holes that had
so puzzled me. Apparently it had been deemed by
Samory wiser to seal the cells entirely rather than secure
them by locks, and the train of powder had been placed
in position in the event of any reverse of fortune<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302"></a>[<a href="./images/302.png">302</a>]</span>
requiring him to secure his treasure quickly before
flight. A single spark, as I had accidentally proved,
was sufficient to open every cell simultaneously.</p>

<p>Fortunately our lamp was not blown out by the concussion,
therefore as soon as the smoke cleared, we
together made another tour of inspection around the
cavities, finding each of them crammed to overflowing
with treasure of every description. Five of the cells,
apparently freshly sealed, contained a portion of the
stolen jewels of Mo, but all the remainder were evidently
the spoils of war, much of it of enormous value. It
amused me, too, to discover in one of the cavities,
among a great collection of costly bejewelled ornaments,
such European articles as a pair of common scissors in
a pasteboard case, several penknives of the commonest
quality, an India-rubber squeaking doll, a child's toy train
in tin, and a mechanical mouse. All were, no doubt,
considered as treasures by the Arab potentate, yet I
reflected that nearly every article in the whole of that
miscellaneous collection had been acquired by the most
ruthless and merciless bloodshed.</p>

<p>When at last we became convinced of the necessity
for finding some exit, we left the chamber by the way
we had entered. The discovery of the wonderful
treasure of the Sanoms made it plain to me that there
must be an exit somewhere, for the packs were far too
ponderous to have been lowered from the Kasbah by the
way we had entered. On reflection I saw that the lion
was evidently kept there to guard the entrance to the
store of treasure, therefore it was not surprising that
there was no outlet in that direction.</p>

<p>No, we should be compelled to repass the brute.
This fact I explained to Liola, but it in no way discon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303"></a>[<a href="./images/303.png">303</a>]</span>certed
her, for she crept past the snapping jaws of the
furious beast calmly, holding the treasured Rock Diadem
close beside her. Presently, on making a diligent
search, we discovered a long dark tunnel running at
right angles to the path we had traversed, and following
this ascended to where a faint but welcome glimmer of
light showed. Soon we were in a small natural cavern,
and a few moments later struggled upward to the light
of day, amazed to find ourselves on the bank of a beautiful
river. At our feet the clear cool water ran by, placid
and peaceful, but away across the grass-plain about half a
mile distant was the once-powerful city of Koussan,
enveloped in black smoke that ascended to the clear
blue heavens, mingled with great flames, the fierce roar
of which reached our ears where we stood.</p>

<p>The vengeance of Mo had indeed overtaken her Arab
enemy, and completely crushed him.</p>



<hr class="full" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXV" id="CHAPTER_XXXV"></a>CHAPTER XXXV.</h2>

<h3>INTO THE MIST.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Our</span> troops had, we found, withdrawn from the burning
city and were encamped about a mile away, taking a
well-earned rest, and watching with satisfaction the
destruction of the once powerful capital of the "Pirate
of the Niger." The presence of Liola, together with the
announcement of the discovery of the treasure of the
Sanoms, that we made to Kona secretly, caused him the
wildest delight. His barbaric instinct overcame him,
and seizing his spear he executed a kind of war-dance
around us, bestowing upon us the most adulatory
phrases of the Dagomba vocabulary. Afterwards he
addressed the assembled soldiers, omitting at my desire<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304"></a>[<a href="./images/304.png">304</a>]</span>
all mention of the jewels of Mo, and three days later,
having secured all the gems and golden ornaments,
together with Samory's hidden wealth, we set forth on
our triumphant return to the mysterious far-off land.</p>

<p>Rapidly and pleasantly we accomplished the long
journey, re-crossing the treacherous Way of the Thousand
Steps without a single mishap, and ascended to the lofty
plateau of Omar's kingdom until, high up in the grey
morning mist, we saw looming before us with almost
spectral indistinctness the gigantic battlements and
domes of the City in the Clouds. On ascending the
rope steps at the Gate of Mo a few days previously we
had ascertained that the expedition to the Hombori
Mountains had been entirely successful, for the enemy
had been met in the pass by the defenders and mercilessly
overwhelmed and slaughtered. Against the lightweight
Maxim guns, weighing only about twenty-five
pounds each and firing 600 to 700 shots per minute
with an effective range of two miles, the old-fashioned
rifles and field-pieces of the force under the traitor
Kouaga had been powerless, hence the whole expedition
had been utterly routed, followed up after their flight
and massacred almost to a man, Kouaga himself being
shot dead by Niaro while strenuously endeavouring to
rally his men for a final onslaught. Omar, at the head
of his victorious army, had re-entered the city only the
day before our arrival, therefore on our return we found
ourselves in the midst of feasting and merry-making of
a most enthusiastic character.</p>

<p>Little wonder was it that when the news of the complete
victory we had secured spread through the city the
joy of the people knew no bounds, for especially welcome
was the information that, in addition to utterly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305"></a>[<a href="./images/305.png">305</a>]</span>
destroying Samory's city we had secured the whole of
his treasure. Kona, Liola and myself held back the
fact that we had also recovered the stolen jewels, and
we also took elaborate precautions that the knowledge
of Liola's safety should not be conveyed prematurely to
Omar.</p>

<p>During the formal welcome that the young Naba,
resplendent in his magnificent bejewelled robes of state
and surrounded by his sages and officers, accorded us at
the great palace-gate, now fully restored, Liola held
back, hiding herself. Not until evening, when I was
sitting with Omar in his luxurious private pavilion after
eating a sumptuous meal served on the royal dishes of
chased gold, I told him confidentially of the recovery of
the lost jewels.</p>

<p>"Impossible, Scars!" he cried in English, starting suddenly
to his feet. "Where did you find them? How?"</p>

<p>Brief words were required to explain how I had discovered
them hidden in Samory's secret cavern beyond
the lion's lair.</p>

<p>"I understood that only the wealth of the old Arab's
Kasbah was hidden there," he exclaimed quickly.
"This news is indeed as astounding as it is welcome."</p>

<p>"Your subjects are unaware that your treasure has
ever been removed from Mo, therefore I have not enlightened
them," I answered. "Come with me and see
if you recognize any of the jewels."</p>

<p>Eagerly he followed me into a small adjoining apartment
where the loot had been deposited, and as we
opened pack after pack he uttered ejaculations of
surprise and complete gratification, recognizing in the
recovered gems the wonderful incomparable heirlooms
of his royal house.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306"></a>[<a href="./images/306.png">306</a>]</span>
He turned to thank me when we had finished, and as
he did so I placed my hand firmly on his arm, saying in
a serious voice:</p>

<p>"In addition to these, Omar, I have also recovered a
jewel of even far greater worth than all this magnificent
collection; one that will shine as the brightest and most
beautiful gem in the diadem of Mo."</p>

<p>A genuine look of bewilderment crossed his pale refined
features for an instant, as he answered:</p>

<p>"I really don't understand, Scars. No jewel can be
of greater intrinsic value than the Treasure of the Sanoms.
What is it?"</p>

<p>For answer, Liola, a veritable vision of classic beauty
in her loose white robe, gold-embroidered at the hem,
and broad girdle of fiery rubies, stepped from behind
the heavy curtain of blue silk where she had been concealed,
and stood before him.</p>

<p>Rigid in speechless amazement he stood for a moment,
then recognizing that his lost love was actually present,
alive and well, he bounded towards her, and with a loud
cry of joy embraced her, brushing back her soft hair and
covering her white open brow with passionate kisses.</p>

<p>It was indeed a joyous reunion, but as I turned intending
to withdraw discreetly and leave them alone
together to continue their exchange of confidences, my
friend promptly called me back, saying:</p>

<p>"Stay, Scars, old fellow! Let me hear from your
own lips the solution of this mystery of the return of the
dead to life. Truly you have recovered a jewel worth to
me a hundred times all the treasures of Mo."</p>

<p>Crossing again towards him I described briefly the
revolting circumstances in which I had discovered her,
a harem slave of our Arab enemy; how we had both<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307"></a>[<a href="./images/307.png">307</a>]</span>
narrowly escaped being burned to death, our subsequent
adventures in the damp subterranean burrow, and the
finding of the secreted treasure.</p>

<p>"Liola herself also made one discovery," I said in
conclusion, laughing and turning towards her.</p>

<p>Gently disengaging herself from her lover's fond arms
she went behind the curtain where she had hidden, and
on coming forth again held in her slim white hands a
round package still securely wrapped in untanned hide,
which she handed to Omar.</p>

<p>"The Rock Diadem of the Naya!" he cried in joy,
when his trembling, eager hands had opened it. "The
most valued of all our possessions!" Then, turning
towards Liola, he tenderly placed upon her head the
historic mark of royalty, saying in his own tongue:</p>

<p>"Now that the days of our sorrow have passed like
the shadow of a cloud upon a sunlit sea, we will be wed
as soon as it is meet for us so to do, and upon thy brow
thus shalt rest the diadem of the first Naya, the upright
queen to whom Mo oweth her magnificence, her power,
and her present prosperity. Thou shalt sit beside me
upon the Emerald Throne; thou shalt be known as the
Naya Liola."</p>

<p>Again he embraced her with ineffable tenderness, and
with her handsome head pillowed heavily upon his
shoulder her breast heaved, and from her deep blue
fathomless eyes there fell tears of joy.</p>

<p>At last, having received the warmest thanks from my
old companion through many misfortunes and from the
woman he loved, I turned and sought the sage Goliba, to
whom I told the good news of his daughter's safety and
betrothal to Omar.</p>

<p>Three days later the marriage took place amid the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308"></a>[<a href="./images/308.png">308</a>]</span>
most gorgeous pomp and the wildest popular rejoicings,
the strange ceremony being performed by the high-priest
of the Temple of Zomara beneath the golden figure of
the Crocodile-god that hung suspended above the
Emerald Throne. Feasts and merry-making continued
throughout a whole moon, and the mystic city, decorated
with flags and flowers, was agog by day and brilliantly
illuminated by night. Never in the long history of the
ancient kingdom had such costly banquets been served;
never had the royal entertainments been on such lavish
scale; never had the sounds of revelry contained such
a true genuine ring, for never before had the people
been so happy and content. Though on the day of the
marriage Liola was solemnly crowned with the wonderful
Rock Diadem of Mo, I, as keeper of the royal treasure,
allowed no word to go forth regarding the theft and recovery
of the Sanom jewels, which had already been deposited
in their original hiding-place beneath the lake.
Samory's treasure was, however, given to Liola by Omar,
and she ordered half of it to be distributed to the poor,
an act of generosity that won for her intense popularity.</p>

<p>Her action was, she told me in confidence, a thank-offering
to Zomara for her timely rescue from a terrible
fate.</p>



<hr class="full" />
<h2><a name="CONCLUSION" id="CONCLUSION"></a>CONCLUSION.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Samory</span>, the truculent old Arab, escaped. By some
means he eluded us in the dark intricacies of that subterranean
way, and groping along in a similar manner
to ourselves, he evidently fled to the forest, for he has
since collected the scattered remnant of his nomadic
bands, and although he has never since troubled us, yet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309"></a>[<a href="./images/309.png">309</a>]</span>
he now and then commits depredations on the borders
of the English and French spheres of influence. Ere
long he will overstep the bounds, and one Power or
another will certainly send a punitive expedition to crush
and humiliate him, as they have crushed the arrogant
Prempeh of Ashanti.</p>

<p>During many months the means by which the theft
of the Treasure of the Sanoms had been effected remained
an inscrutable mystery, and it was only on the
day previous to my departure from the mysterious land
for England, or rather more than six months ago,
that the problem was solved and in a manner entirely
unexpected.</p>

<p>In preparation for the annual feast in honour of
the Crocodile-god I had occasion to go secretly and
alone to the submerged Treasure-house, in order to
obtain certain jewels which tradition decreed should
be worn on that day by the reigning sovereign. I had
emptied the lake, unsealed the cover of the well-like
aperture, locked the mechanism fatal to intruders, descended
and obtained what I sought, when on ascending
I was dismayed to find water pouring in upon me in
increasing volumes. Upwards I climbed, struggling desperately
against the inrushing flood thundering down
upon me, and was aghast to find, when I gained the
surface, that the sluice-gates that held back the waters feeding
the lake had been opened, and that it was rapidly refilling.
Instantly it occurred to me to replace the cover,
and in breathless haste I succeeded in screwing it down
and dashing for my life back to the bank, the water being
up to my arm-pits ere I reached it.</p>

<p>When next second I glanced upward to the mound
where the mechanism was concealed, I saw standing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310"></a>[<a href="./images/310.png">310</a>]</span>
thereon the wild-looking figure of a woman with her
soiled, tattered garments fluttering in the wind.</p>

<p>Her long scraggy arms were raised high above her
head, and she was crying aloud to me.</p>

<p>Without a moment's hesitation I dashed forward up
the hill to secure the person who had apparently discovered
the secret of the Treasure-house, but on approaching
her closely I suddenly halted in astonishment.</p>

<p>The wretched, fiendish-looking virago, upon whose
face were the most hideous distortions of insanity I had
ever witnessed, was none other than the once-powerful
tyrannical autocrat, the Great White Queen!</p>

<p>Across her narrow, withered brow, brown almost as a
toad's back, a single wisp of thin grey hair strayed; in
her eyes was the unmistakeable light of madness, while
the nails of her outstretched fingers were as sharp and
long as the talons of some beast of prey. So weird and
repulsive-looking was she that I stood before her dumbfounded.</p>

<p>"Ah!" she shrieked to me exultantly, in a harsh,
rasping voice, "I have killed them&mdash;drowned them all,
the accursed spies and renegades! The traitor Kouaga
captured me as I fled for life from the city-gate, and
promising me release and safe escort from this land of
evil spirits in return for the secret of the Treasure-house,
I recklessly gave it to him, on condition that his armed
men should assist me to recover my lost position as
Queen of Mo. I promised to forget the past and take
him back into my favour. But, securing my jewels, he
conveyed them to his Arab master at Koussan, and left
me alone, deposed and ruined. May Zomara crush and
torture him, the traitor!" Then, turning with wild
gesture towards the lake, now a great sheet of placid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311"></a>[<a href="./images/311.png">311</a>]</span>
water, her hands clutched convulsively, her eyes starting
as if she saw, in her disordered imagination, a host of her
enemies, she cried: "This, at last, is the hour of my
revenge! I have drawn the lever, and while they were
below with you they were drowned like rats in a hole!"
And she gave vent to a short, dry laugh, exclaiming:
"They refused to assist me to tear the usurper from the
Emerald Throne, so I have killed them. My work is
finished! I have reigned and have been deposed; I
have striven for the people, and have been rewarded by
their curses; I have&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>At this moment, determined to carry her back to the
city, I sprang forward and gripped her lean, bony arms.
With colossal strength, engendered by insanity, she
fought and bit, shrieking and showering imprecations
upon me, it requiring all my strength to hold her; but
presently she became quiet again, uttering long strings
of rapid incoherent words that plainly showed the hopeless
state of her mind.</p>

<p>Thus walking, we gained the edge of the lake, and
having passed the cascade were skirting the river when,
with a suddenness that took me completely by surprise,
she slipped from my grasp, and with a wild exclamation
dashed towards the warm, oozy bank.</p>

<p>Next second I noticed that the waters were alive with
the sacred reptiles, but ere I could reach her she threw
up her long, thin arms, and uttering an unearthly yell,
plunged in.</p>

<p>A dozen hideous, hungry jaws snapped viciously as
she cast herself amongst them, and an instant later where,
with a shriek of horror, she disappeared for ever beneath
the waters, the swiftly-flowing current was tinged red by
long streaks of human blood.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312"></a>[<a href="./images/312.png">312</a>]</span>
In an excess of religious fervour she had sacrificed
herself to her god Zomara.</p>

<hr />

<p>This is no apologue. Little there remains to tell.
Under the beneficent rule of Omar and Liola power,
prosperity and contentment have now returned to the
mysterious ancient realm, within which I have been the
first stranger to set foot. As principal official of the ruler
of the land that, although familiar to me, is still a
mystery to the Royal Geographical Society, I left for
England a few months ago on a mission to the greatest
White Queen, Victoria, offering her assistance in her
effort to crush the cruel sway of our mutual enemies the
Ashantis. Our offer was cordially accepted, and the
successful issue of the campaign which caused the downfall
of Prempeh is now well known. Before returning
to resume my duties as Governor of Mo, the far-off
spectral City in the Clouds, into which no stranger may
enter, I have, however, written down, at the instigation
of the publishers whose name this volume bears upon
its title-page, this plain tale of travel, treason and
treasure as a record of the first successful journey to
the high-up, inaccessible land of the Naya, the once-dreaded
Great White Queen.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
