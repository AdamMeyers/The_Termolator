<p class="rightheader">
The Ancre Front, 13th November.<br />
</p>

<p>You read the reports. The names of the places that
have been taken, the calculations of the gains, the numbers
of the prisoners, leave you cold. Words! words! It is on
the field of battle, amidst the thunder of the guns and the
magic glow of fires, that one should read the bulletins of
victory.</p>

<p>This evening a heady, irresistible joy took possession
of the Army. The prisoners were pouring in. The men
were singing in their quarters. Upon a front 3-1/2 miles
wide and nearly 1-1/2 deep our Allies had broken the German
lines on both sides of the Ancre.</p>

<p>They have been giving me details of the battle. From
hour to hour, here, in the midst of the troops, I am being
told the incidents of the fighting. A risky privilege!</p>

<p>The despatches which come to us; the despatch riders
who, at the utmost speed of their motor-cycles, bring us
reports through the ruts and mud of the roads; the
messages of the telegraph&mdash;everything has assumed a
heroic quality. A feverish joy quivers in every face. Even
the bell of the telephone follows, strangely, the measure
of our heart-beats.</p>

<p>"We owe this victory to our quickness," a Colonel tells
me. "This battle was an <i>impromptu</i>." The word is a
picture. It is absolutely right.</p>

<p>At six o'clock&mdash;that is to say, in the grey light of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
morning&mdash;after a short but annihilating artillery preparation,
the divisions posted in the first line dashed forward
through the fog and drizzle. The objective was three
villages&mdash;Beaumont-Hamel and Beaucourt on the North
bank of the river, and, on the South, Saint Pierre-Divion.</p>

<p>Let me tell you something of the country and its
difficulties.</p>

<p>Swamps, soggy undulations formed by the trenches and
the convoys, a wet, clayey soil, into which one sinks to the
waist. Mud everywhere. Slime everywhere. One must
slide down the funnels and holes that the shells have made.
Thus the waves of the assault gather for their onset. The
Germans had constructed defences formed of five lines of
trenches, each alternated with at least three rows of barbed
wire entanglements. The <i>chevaux de frise</i> and other
obstacles covered, in places, a space over 200 yards wide.</p>

<p>On the one hand and on the other the banks of the
Ancre ran up into bluffs like buttresses. Since his failure
of the 1st of July, the enemy has cut among these natural
protections deep trenches which wind along parallel to the
course of the river. He has also set up on the slopes
powerful machine-gun emplacements and blockhouses with
mortars.</p>

<p>The English advance went like clockwork. The secret
had been well kept; the evening before, the troops of this
sector were quite unaware that an advance was to take
place.</p>

<p>An absolute determination inspired both officers and
men. The result of the attack was never in doubt. The
trenches were taken by storm, together with those who
manned them. It was a veritable harvest of men. The
fourth line was taken at the point of the bayonet in
<i>eighteen minutes</i>.</p>

<p>At eight in the morning we attacked the outskirts of the
three villages. Beaumont-Hamel was the first to be taken,
with its garrison. Before Beaucourt we were brought to
a halt by machine-gun fire. Saint Pierre-Divion was outflanked.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
The artillery increased its range and cut
short all counter-attacks.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i02large.jpg"><img src="images/i02.jpg" width="400" height="282" alt="" /></a>
<div class="caption"><p>1. IN BEAUMONT-HAMEL.</p></div>
</div>

<p>By nine o'clock the objective was gained with complete
success. The fog grew thicker. The fire of the heavy
guns and the barrage fires followed one another without
pause.</p>

<p>Through twilight gloom and the mists of low-lying
clouds monstrous lightnings flicker across this spectral
landscape. The smallest hill is a Sinai. In a leap of nearly
1-1/2 miles the batteries have advanced at the same pace
as the troops, taking such cover as Heaven sends them.
All this sector smokes and roars to its farthest extremities.
It is as if there were dragons squatting everywhere by the
hundred and spitting flame. Fires break out, blushing
palely through the fog. Stores of munitions explode
behind the villages. It is like the brute thunder of the
earthquake.</p>

<p>The fiercest fighting developed at Beaumont-Hamel,
where the ground is full of great caves that run into one
another. In these there was plenty of room for four
companies.</p>

<p>Next, the centre of interest shifted to the South bank
of the Ancre, where Y Gully commands the passage of the
river and the road to Beaucourt. This ravine, upon which
three months' work had been spent, was a positive arsenal.
Every 20 yards along it there was a machine-gun. The
Germans believed it to be impregnable. This evening the
English had their own guns in it.</p>

<p>Victory everywhere! Three villages taken; more than
2,000 prisoners counted already! I have just been to see
them. They are encamped along the edge of an immense
bivouac. All about them the heaviest of the guns spit
out, minute by minute, their delicate ton-weight mouthfuls.
The prisoners are identified, questioned, and searched. A
dazed stupor is all that their terrified faces declare. They
have suffered very little damage, for most of them have
been surprised in their caves and dug-outs. Many of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
are still wearing their helmets. Their officers have accepted
their bad fortune, one would say, gladly. There is nothing
of bravado in their carriage. The Tommies surround this
encampment curiously. With a friendliness that is very
touching they offer, some cigarettes, others food.
Generosity on the one side; a growing astonishment on
the other. The German soldiers, nearly all Silesians,
accept these things with a sort of childish gratitude.</p>

<p>The motor-ambulances move here, there and everywhere
over the clayey fields, where the wheels of the
ammunition wagons have drawn mighty furrows, like
those that peaceful toil once made here. One hardly sees
the faces of these men. They are blanks, for their thoughts
are elsewhere, within. On the other hand, one's attention
is seized by such things as their feet, mere lumps of clay,
that at times the red touch of a swathed wound enlivens.
Motor-'buses&mdash;as in London&mdash;run upon the roads. Those
who are lightly wounded crowd to the top. One of them
wears a pointed helmet, where shines the two-headed eagle.
Others hang the Iron Cross upon their caps. They are all
laughing and joking like schoolboys.</p>

<p>The road to Bapaume, to the north, is almost all free.
From to-day begins, on this side, the siege of that town,
which the Germans have converted into a stronghold. All
over the plain the English are lighting camp-fires: and
in perfect safety, since the enemy's line has retired about
1-1/2 miles. The skirl of bagpipes, the scream of fifes, the
choruses of the men, rise into the foggy night. It proves
the truth of the saying: "To live truly is to live perilously."</p>

<p>Victory! And the battle goes on.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_1II" id="CHAPTER_1II">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">IN FRONT OF THE MUNICH TRENCH.</p>


<p class="rightheader">
Beaumont-Hamel, 15th November.<br />
</p>

<p>That two-hour tramp through a few kilometres of
trenches was a heart-breaking business. We floundered
through holes, we were swallowed up in bogs, while the
mud that fell from the parapets gradually spread itself over
our oilskins. A steel helmet becomes wonderfully heavy
after an hour or so, and a dizzy headache soon tormented
us, from the constant right-angled turns which we were
obliged to make, like so many slaves at a cornmill. But
what a reward has been ours since our arrival!</p>

<p>Here we are, seated at the horizontal loophole of a
quite new observation post, in the front line, in the very
trench from which, the day before yesterday, the English
launched their attack.</p>

<p>In front, towards the left, is Beaumont-Hamel. Out of
this heap of rubbish start up three-cornered bits of wall,
which give to these ruins the look of a dwarf village. On
the hillside a mangled copse looks like those guileless charcoal
strokes which one sees in a child's drawing. To the
right&mdash;Beaucourt. Here the ruin is absolute. I have
hunted in vain for any trace of man's handiwork. Even
the dust of the stones has blown away.</p>

<p>A few hundred yards ahead of us the men have just
rushed forward. With rifles held high they spring from
the parapet into the open. They look like an army of ants,
that now moves along in a stream, now closes together
like a vice, now marks time, now plunges into vast funnels,
and again, at racing speed, surges up the gentle slope.
The barbed-wire entanglements cover acres of ground;
they are the eleventh line of the German defences. In
many places the wires are so closely bunched together that
the balls cannot pass through them.</p>

<p>At least a brigade is engaged. One can see the company<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
leaders quite plainly. The shells are bursting everywhere,
throwing up furious fountains of black smoke with
which bits of earth and iron are mingled. The rolling
clouds of the shrapnel seem to frame one regiment.</p>

<p>Ah! Bad luck! That one was well timed which burst
over there on the right, just above the company that was
lying down there. The damage must have been serious.
Men lie on the ground who will never pick themselves up
again. A cloud, the colour of absinthe, hangs sullenly over
those little khaki spots.</p>

<p>On the right, on the left, in front, behind, with a disquieting
skill and precision, the Germans pile barrage upon
barrage. Meanwhile, without a pause, the troops advance
across this hell. I can follow, with the naked eye, every
movement of an active young officer, who is wearing a light
yellow overcoat, and who is charging at the head of his
company, with a cane under his left arm and a revolver
in his right hand as calmly as if he were strolling along
Regent Street or Piccadilly.</p>

<p>The human wave, breaking through the barrage, disappears
suddenly in the earth. It is as if a chasm had
opened to swallow all these men at a gulp. And now,
listen! For the gunfire is punctuated with sharp detonations.
It sounds like a shrill drumming, swelled by furious
shouts and cries of agony. The Tommies have entered the
enemy's lines. After a short period of bombing, they
advance, yard by yard, with the bayonet. Round the
blockhouses the machine-guns rattle. We listen anxiously
to these thousand voices of the attack. Every man has
vanished. The field of vision is empty. Only the variegated
smokes of the different shells spread themselves
slowly abroad. The uncertainty is unbearable. Half an
hour later we learn from the telephone that the attack has
succeeded. The brigade has done its work. We have just
witnessed, on the north bank of the Ancre, the capture of an
important trench, or rather redoubt, nearly 450 yards away
from Beaumont&mdash;the Munich Trench.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i03large.jpg"><img src="images/i03.jpg" width="400" height="269" alt="" /></a>
<div class="caption"><p>2. PRISONERS.</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>Here again there has been a famous haul of prisoners.
More than 300 unwounded soldiers have been compelled to
surrender. In a short time the first of them cross in front
of our observation post. They are haggard, covered with
mud, and their eyes are the eyes of trapped beasts. Two
of them, converted into impromptu stretcher-bearers, are
carrying a wounded officer on a stretcher that is soaked
in blood.</p>

<p>And now the battle increases everywhere in violence. We
hear that on this side of Beaucourt some strong reserves,
collected there by the Germans, have just been surrounded
and taken prisoners. A whole brigade staff has fallen into
the hands of the English. More than 5,000 prisoners have
been counted already. It will take at least two days to
count all that have been taken. A genuine victory!</p>

<p>The "tanks" have played an honourable part in the
battle, and I have just seen two of them at work. My
impressions may be summed up in these words: a huge
amazement and satisfaction.</p>

<p>One of them, which has been christened <i>The Devil's
Delight</i>, did marvels at Beaucourt. This deliberate
leviathan, having placed itself boldly at the head of the
advancing flood of men, took up its position at the entrance
of the ruined village. At first the Germans fled. Then,
one by one, they came back. With machine-guns, bombs,
rifles and mortars they endeavoured to pierce its double
shell. Nothing availed. Squatted on its tail, the terrific
tank lorded it there like a king on his horse. It
made no objection whatever to being approached. Some
sappers tried to place bombs under it, to blow it sky high.
Inside it the crew shammed dead. The Germans took
heart. Ten, twenty, thirty men, armed with screw-jacks
and mallets laboured to overthrow it. But what could
even two battalions have accomplished against this patient
mastodon, whose skin was steel and whose weight was
800 tons? A colonel, mad with rage, fired the eight
barrels of his revolver at it, point-blank. If the tank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
could have laughed it must have burst with delight. Its
sense of humour is a strictly warlike one.</p>

<p>After a full quarter of an hour of silence the Germans,
believing that the crew had been destroyed and that the
monster was helpless, surrounded it boldly and in considerable
numbers. Thereupon, unmasking its machine-guns,
and opening fire from its sides, the terrible creature began
to hack them in bits, mow them down in heaps, drill them
full of holes and slay them by the dozen.</p>

<p>A giant miller, grinding death!</p>

<p>An hour later, when the larger part of the English troops
succeeded in reaching Beaucourt, they found the Germans,
dead and dying, piled around the tank. The tank says
little, but to the point.</p>

<p>Three cheers for Mademoiselle Devil's Delight!</p>

<p class="chaptitle">THE REAL SUPERMEN.</p>

<p class="center">"<i>We are consolidating our positions.</i>"</p>

<p class="rightheader">
(English Communiqué, 16th November.)<br />
</p>

<p>Here is a story.</p>

<p>Some time ago, on the North bank of the Ancre, in the
Beaumont-Hamel Sector, everyone was affected with a
curious boredom. Nothing happened: very little artillery
fire; not so much as a pretence at an attack. It was a
dead calm. The bombs were all asleep. Muscles grew
slack. Enthusiasm staled. Boredom, that worst misery of
trench life, reigned supreme.</p>

<p>One evening this slackness among the troops&mdash;and it
was as bad on one side as on the other&mdash;produced a curious
result. Among the Germans, a homesick Silesian began to
sing some of the carols of his own country. His voice rose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
freshly into the fresh night. At the same time on the
English side, a Highlander, stirred by the sweetness of the
autumn evening, blew a few shrill notes upon his fife.
The voice of the man and the fife supported one another,
and so a concert began, a concert of old songs, the simple
happy songs of the peasant. The English shouted to the
Germans, "Give us Gott Strafe England!" and the
Germans obliged with the "Song of Hate." "Encore!
Encore!" cried the Highlander, whose fife was seeking to
catch the air that the enemy was singing. The song began
again, the fife supporting it. Then it was taken up by all
the English. But to what sort of a rhythm! The "Song
of Hate," slow as plain song, had suddenly become, as it
crossed the trenches, a crazy, jerky, rollicking ragtime, a
tune for the <i>can-can</i>. The Germans supposed that they
were being chaffed. By way of applause, they let fly a
shower of bombs. To this compliment the English replied
in kind. Then the night closed down upon a boredom more
dreadful than ever.</p>

<p>I have told you this story as a sort of commentary upon
the epigram in which a certain colonel explained this very
successful two days' battle: "Our attack, like our victory,
was an impromptu."</p>

<p>To capture three villages and eleven lines of the enemy's
defences upon a front 3-1/2 miles wide and nearly 1-1/2 deep, is
pretty good. To take a haul of nearly 6,000 prisoners out
of their dug-outs and caves and other quarters&mdash;that is
not to be sneezed at either. But to organise the territory
that has been taken and to consolidate it, working night and
day under the constant fire of the enemy&mdash;that is perhaps
a less glorious business, but it is a thing more difficult to
accomplish than any attack.</p>

<p>For two long hours of the night my friend Ruffin, of the
<i>Agence Havas</i>, and I, conducted by our guide, the major,
tramped it through the trenches in order to reach those
which lie under Beaumont. Steel helmet on head, first-aid
equipment and gas mask under arm, we went on between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
the two walls of this roundabout road, our feet sticky with
mud and our eyes continually dazzled. Rockets soared into
the air to burst and then go out like those Roman candles
which blossom into sprays of slowly moving stars. One
might have thought that some unseen juggler, over there on
the blazing skyline, was manipulating huge fiery plates.</p>

<p>The trenches were swarming with soldiers, the reliefs
who were going back to billets, and the reserves who were
taking their places; the sappers and pioneers, with their
picks and shovels, who, protected by the machine-guns,
repair the shelters wherever they have given way; the
ambulance men and the stretcher-bearers; the grave
diggers; the supplying sections, who bring up the cases
of grenades, before ever they appear with food. This crowd
of dim men, ten feet underground, moved like a silent
river.</p>

<p>One hardly thought of talking. To-night, when they
are consolidating the conquered positions, the opposing
artilleries were engaged in a terrific duel. The barrage
fires of the Germans followed one another every quarter of
an hour, each one lasting seven minutes, and each minute
an eternity, when, every second, there fell not less than 100
shells. To protect those who were at work the English
artillery set up curtain fires, which smashed every preparation
for a counter-attack. Marmites, shells, shrapnel,
hurtled from either side of the single line which had been
snatched from this Inferno.</p>

<p>An odd scent of roasted apples catches us by the throat;
our eyes begin to stream in a detestable fashion. "Look
out for the acid drops!" cries our major. We know this
bit of soldiers' slang, which means the lachrymatory shells.
We quickly put on our masks. In perfect safety, crouched
against the wall of the trench, in the company of a hundred
unknown comrades, we wait until the poisonous gust of
yellow smoke has blown away. Through the eye-pieces of
our masks everything seems to be enveloped in some
fabulous steam; the pale lightning of the guns, the ghastly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
discs of the English rockets, the red stars of the German.
But one sound: the clatter of the machine-guns near us,
a muffled thunder as of a rising sea.</p>

<p>In this muddy ditch we are like some lost gang of divers.</p>

<p>And in the meantime, 100 yards ahead of us, in the
midst of choking gases and the tempest of the machine-guns,
soldiers&mdash;heroes&mdash;have never ceased their work.</p>

<p>They hammer nails, they drive in stakes, they sink piles,
they knot together into spider nets the tangled strands of
the barbed wire. All honour to them! These are the
Supermen.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_1IV" id="CHAPTER_1IV">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">SURPRISES OF A MOONLIT FROSTY NIGHT.</p>


<p>A true Walpurgis Night of heroes and warriors. It is
not on the summit of the Brocken that I have witnessed it,
but, looking out over the plain of the Ancre, from a tree.
This tree, every evening, is wreathed with the fumes of
asphyxiating shells. Its woolly streamers of shrapnel smoke
are like the foliage around a heraldic crown.</p>

<p>As soon as twilight is come, aeroplanes cross the neighbouring
lines and attack this tree with their machine-guns.
It is treated like a combatant. Herein, perhaps, lies the
secret of its clumsy strength and beauty. It stands upon its
hill, solid and straight. It holds its ground as few men
could do. It is a French ash that stands upon the field of
battle in the very middle of the British Army.</p>

<p>It has become an observation post. One climbs it by a
straight ladder 160 feet long. In its highest fork one of
the engineers has made a wooden box, bound together with
barbed wire, with a little canvas to hide it. Field-glasses,
maps, range-finders are there. All the gusts of the
autumnal breeze blow through it. Up here, too, men
are pitched about as if they were in the mizzen-top of a
cruiser. Strange nest for war eagles!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>"Perfect weather for flying," the major tells me.</p>

<p>A clear, frosty, moonlight night broods over the black
distances of the plain. The river and its swampy edges
glisten like silver coins. No sign of life. Only the guns,
all round the horizon, roar beneath their crests of lightning.</p>

<p>Imagine that after blinding yourself with a very tight
and thick bandage you suddenly open your eyes. Glowing
discs, will o' the wisps, haloes, flashing rainbows, a whole
ballet of lights spins upon your retina. Up here,
that is the spectacle that each night brings. The
battlefield appears to be electrified. At one moment, sharp,
stabbing flashes, cold arrows of light. It is the English
guns shelling the enemy. The next, radiances which
divide, spread out fanwise, or blossom like flowers. They
are German marmites or crapouillots.</p>

<p>The sounds of the guns intersect one another. They are
hard and dry, when some battery, near by, opens fire; dull,
soft and muffled, according as the distance becomes greater.
A stroke upon a gong, followed by a long metallic shriek,
high in the air, announces a heavy shell. After a hoarse
scream a machine-gun begins to crackle, rending both air
and men.</p>

<p>It is all one vast intermittent hurly-burly, lightning flashing
low down, V-shaped sheaves of red fire. And all is,
each time, unexpected, cruelly inconsequent, magnificent
and devastating.</p>

<p>Thousands of men are there, and thousands upon
thousands, all over this plain of the Ancre. There they
lie, buried in their trenches, their nerves like stretched
wire, ready to spring forward on the instant.</p>

<p>From here we can see one of the last sectors to be
conquered.</p>

<p>It is land over which the offensive has passed.</p>

<p>And our hearts ache as we remember that down there,
near this swamp, it is not even in ill-made trenches that
the English sections are keeping their watch, but, simply,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
in shell-holes, where the water lies deep, holes whose
sides have been hastily shored up&mdash;veritable human hells.</p>

<p>The fireworks did not keep us waiting. About ten
o'clock, a certain unwonted nervousness becoming evident
among the Germans, the two English trenches of the
first line let off a bouquet of rockets. Balls of light,
red, blue or green, climbed 90 feet into the air. For a
moment they rose, hesitatingly, like toy balloons at
the end of a string, then burst into stars or sheaves,
lighting up, as with a ghastly daylight, this neutral
ground, this "no man's land," which the scattered corpses
of the patrols alone inhabit. After each flight of rockets
the guns came savagely to life, and, below our watch-tower,
even in greater numbers, even more furious, other
batteries, and yet others, proclaimed their presence.
"Barrage!" one of the short-lived fire-balls demanded
over to the west. The firing increased, pounding the
sector from end to end. This light from fairyland,
then, was nothing but a cry for help! In a moment the
Ancre and its swamps were blushing.</p>

<p>The moon began to veil herself with small round
clouds. "Watch out for the aeroplanes," our staff-major
told us again. In a quarter of an hour his warning was
justified.</p>

<p>The snarl of engines filled the milky spaces of the
sky. Two squadrons against two. The English searchlights
found the enemy for a moment, then lost him.
Then from every crest and from smallest hollow the anti-aircraft
guns began their barrage. In the sky nothing
could be seen but the commas of flame and blazing
curves, which marked where the shrapnel and the shells
had burst. The machine-guns chattered like an applauding
crowd.</p>

<p>A few planes succeeded in crossing the barrage. It was
magic&mdash;of another kind.</p>

<p>One, two, five incendiary bombs were thrown by the
enemy. The eye was dazzled as by a sudden appearance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
of the aurora-borealis. The night became a ghastly
day. Thick columns of smoke rose into the air, then,
half-way to the clouds, swelled up like the tops of palm-trees.
And thus they remained, twenty minutes after
the explosion, without dissolving, steady against the
wind, turning themselves into canopies and domes and a
preposterous hedge of giant parasols.</p>

<p>One might have thought that some fabulous forest
had just sprung up, filled with domed palaces of fantastic
shape.</p>

<p>A night very fruitful of surprises&mdash;barrages, rockets,
anti-aircraft firing, a battle of aeroplanes, incendiary
bombs. Truly the Great Game, this!</p>

<p>I left my watch-tower tree like a man who has saved
his soul from the black powers of sorcery.</p>

<p class="chaptitle">THE BATTLE REOPENS.</p>


<p class="rightheader">
18th November.<br />
</p>

<p>The Battle of the Ancre, which for a moment had
died down, began again this morning, at dawn, with a
new violence.</p>

<p>The English had only paused just long enough to
oil the vast machine, which has now resumed its regular,
methodic movements; and the latest news permits us to
anticipate a fresh and substantial success.</p>

<p>The scene of these last events has been rather different
from that which witnessed the English advance of the
12th and 13th of November. This, one may say in
passing, proves the elasticity of the British offensive.</p>

<p>If the eye travels, on the map, to the right, beyond
the positions in which the last battle was fought, it
follows a line almost parallel to the valley of the Ancre.
To-night, then, the English, not pursuing this theoretically
correct line, inclined their front slightly to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
South, to the centre of a line drawn between Thiepval
and Le Sars. This re-entering angle formed an obvious
obstacle to the domination of the Ancre valley upon the
whole of this part of the British front. For this reason
General Sir Douglas Haig decided to abolish it.</p>

<p>Hence the movement of this morning.</p>

<p>The attack was elaborately prepared, and with the
utmost secrecy, and was launched at dawn.</p>

<p>At the moment of writing this telegram the reports
that are coming in from the scene of action show that
the operation is being carried out, within the limits
assigned, very successfully. To employ an expression
coined by one of their own number, the Boche prisoners
are "pouring" to the rear.</p>

<p>This morning the weather, so fine during the last three
days, was extremely unfavourable to any movement of
troops. There had been heavy snow during the night,
and for the first time this winter our Allies fought in the
snow. About 8 o'clock, the temperature having risen, a
thaw set in. After that it was in foul mud that they did
their fighting.</p>

<p>In order to understand properly the British man&oelig;uvres
on the two banks of the Ancre, we must remark that
yesterday, the 17th of November, the English had executed
a movement which obviously aimed at assisting
to-day's operations.</p>

<p>Shortly, by outflanking the village of Beaucourt to
the East, they had carried their foremost positions, by
yesterday evening, as far as the little wood of Hollande.
Now it is clear that any advance in this direction seriously
menaces Grandcourt and those positions on the north bank
of the Ancre, which the British troops attacked this morning.</p>

<p>A superior staff-officer remarked lately in my hearing
that the German line, throughout the recent fighting, has
exhibited points of varying strength. He attributed this
circumstance to the work of the English artillery. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
resistance which the enemy had been able to offer had
varied directly with the effectiveness of the English gunfire.</p>

<p>It is also noticeable that the German losses in killed,
prisoners and missing are considerably greater than the
corresponding losses among the English. This result is
apparently due to the fact either that the Germans surrender
more readily than the English, or that the British
artillery causes the enemy to sustain the heavier damage
in dead and wounded, or else finally that, unlike the
English, the Germans do not include their lightly
wounded in the total of their losses.</p>

<p>Whatever the causes may be, that the issue of this
battle has been disastrous for the Germans becomes daily
more evident. It appears now that they are thinking of
shortening their line where it is opposed to the British
Army between Puisieux-les-Monts and Grandcourt.
Under the increasing pressure of our Allies, the Germans,
who are convinced that Grandcourt must soon fall, are
entrenching themselves with feverish haste upon a new
line, which unites Puisieux with Miraumont.</p>

<p>The enemy, using Puisieux as the pivot of his retiring
movement, would thus describe an angle whose depth,
from Puisieux to the Ancre, is about 2 miles, and whose
width, between Grandcourt and Miraumont, is about 1-1/4
miles.</p>

<p>It is possible, however, that the British offensive may
to some extent disorganise the beautiful and geometric
symmetry of this new "strategic retreat" of the Germans.</p>

<p class="chaptitle">ON THE EDGE OF THE FRAY.</p>


<p class="rightheader">
19th November.<br />
</p>

<p>Yesterday was a good day for the English. Our
friends were successful on nearly the whole front which
they attacked. The only difficulty which they encountered&mdash;and
this was not serious&mdash;was on their left
centre; that is to say, to the South of Grandcourt. Thereabouts
the ground favoured the defence, for it is cut up
into a number of deep gorges, where the Boches had constructed
redoubts and "nests" of machine-guns.</p>

<p>But, on the other hand, the Canadians did wonders
on the left, pushing their patrols right up to the Western
outskirts of Grandcourt.</p>

<p>The advance of the British troops on the North bank
of the Ancre to the East of Beaucourt has caused the
fortified village of Grandcourt to be menaced on more
than one side.</p>

<p>They say that yesterday the German artillery made a
very weak reply to the fire of the British guns. This is
certainly not due to any shortage of material or ammunition
suffered by Prince Rupert in this quarter. It is well
known, on the contrary, that he has concentrated against
the English an enormous quantity of these things. This
weakness of the German reply must be due either to the
destructive precision of the British fire, or to the formation
of that line of resistance, about which I told you yesterday,
in the rear of the present front.</p>

<p>The German prisoners who have been taken during the
day say that the Boches suffered comparatively little
damage, during the attack, from the British fire, since
they were in dug-outs of great strength and depth. But
when the infantry arrived they found themselves hemmed
helplessly in on all sides, and were forced to surrender <i>en
masse</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>The same prisoners cannot sufficiently praise the performance
of the tanks, about which they speak with a
kind of awful admiration. They always use the same
word when they describe these armour-plated monsters:
"Marvellous! Marvellous!"</p>

<p>They say that the German troops in the first line are
well enough fed, but that as soon as they go into reserve
or are given a rest their diet is at once restricted.</p>

<p class="chaptitle">THE CHARNEL-HOUSE.</p>


<p class="rightheader">
19th November. Evening.<br />
</p>

<p>On this November Sabbath the belfries of Contay,
Warloy, Senlis and a dozen other villages of Picardy are
sending forth through the fog their regular summons
to vespers. It is very cold, and the snow which fell the
other night has become foul mud, in which men, beasts
and wagons flounder and splash.</p>

<p>The Tommies in their quarters have made a rather
more careful toilet than usual, and are now gathered,
in some neighbouring field or under some shed out of
which a church has been improvised, to listen to the words
of their chaplains. Peace, it would seem, reigns everywhere.</p>

<p>Only, alas! in appearance. For overpowering the voices
of priests and sound of bells the guns begin their booming
out a few paces away. Peace has not dwelt, this
many a day, either in Englebelmer or in Mesnil, which
offer to the eyes of the passer-by the spectacle of their
desolated ruins, their silent belfries, their indescribable
sadness. Nor does Peace dwell, assuredly, on this battlefield
where you see these quagmires, these dead, bare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
fields that, one would say, have been trampled by generations
of men; these deserted trenches that have fallen in
here and there; these networks of barbed wire, to-day,
happily, no longer of any service; these shattered
wagons, these rusting weapons; these gun shelters
which dart lightning; these parks of munitions and
materials; these strayed horses; these lines of muddy,
brooding men&mdash;in a word, all this wretchedness&mdash;and,
over all, covering everything as with a veil, this sky that
seems heavy with threats, with <i>hostility</i>.</p>

<p>Yet, before the war, few of the countrysides of
France can have breathed a more sweet and perfect spirit
of peace. A soldier who was here last spring, before
ever men had come hither to destroy one another, told
me of the delight which he took in this pleasant corner
of Picardy. "It was," he said, "a landscape by Claude
Lorraine."</p>

<p>We were halted at the head of a small valley which
runs easily downwards, near Mesine, towards the Ancre,
and we were looking out across the country. At our feet
the river, coming from the East, turned in a gentle curve
towards the South, and was lost to sight in the direction
of Avelun and Albert. The stream, considerably swollen
by the recent rains, wound slowly between marshes and
flooded fields.</p>

<p>The tall poplars of the valley, stripped of their
leaves as much by the bullets as by the rough weather,
moved gently in the breeze. Yesterday a dozen villages
saw themselves reflected in the Ancre, and clothed the
neighbourhood of the river with a share of their own
prosperity. They were, among others, Mesnil, Hamel,
Beaumont and Miraumont on the North bank. Thiepval,
Saint Pierre-Divion and Grandcourt on the South. But the
same devices of man that have massacred the trees of
the valley and stripped Thiepval of its forest, have
levelled these fortress-villages with the ground, and it
is in vain that to-day we may hope to distinguish them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
from the rest of this dismal country. Even as we looked,
the shells of the opposing artilleries blotted out the last
traces of Grandcourt. The guns, for ever the guns!
They are the only sign of life in all this land of Death.</p>

<p>The little cemetery at Hamel, which we passed on
our road, was not likely to dissipate these gloomy
thoughts. In what a condition the battle has left it!
It lay, unfortunately for itself, just between the two lines,
English and German. But, indeed, it is no more and
no less sad a sight than all that surrounds it; no more,
no less than Beaumont; no more, no less than Beaucourt,
to which we have now come.</p>

<p>A little in front of Beaucourt is a small hill, a sort
of spur, lying towards the South-west. On the morning
of the 13th of November it faced precisely in the direction
whence the British attack was about to be launched.
Even in its present state one can, from the lie of the
ground and from the débris which is found scattered
everywhere about, form some faint idea of what the
Boches had made out of this natural fortress.</p>

<p>The British infantry, however, never hesitated a
moment to storm the place, and their impetuosity was
such that in 18 minutes it was in their hands.</p>

<p>If you do not know the price at which the English,
like ourselves, bought this victory, go out upon this
advanced work of Beaucourt. Take your courage in
both hands and look about you. See there that group
of fallen soldiers, the glorious victors of the Ancre,
who lie still untouched, by the side of the Boches whom
they have dragged down with them to death, after hand-to-hand
struggles that no words may describe. Looking
like pilgrims clothed in homespun, the English stretcher-bearers,
now grave-diggers, "tidy up" the field of battle.</p>

<p>Poor and dear Tommies! They have fallen with
their faces to the German trench. They fought with
their heads, as do ours, for there is not a shell-hole of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
which they have not taken advantage during their
advance against their enemy. They have fought, also,
like lions, since they have gained the victory.</p>

<p>One of them, a great, athletic-looking fellow with
black hair, has fallen head forwards into a shell-hole.
His poor, shattered body is drained of blood, but his face
is a fiery red, as if his rage had risen there as he died.</p>

<p>Another, of slighter, more fragile frame, lies on his
back, his legs apart, with a ball through his forehead.
Close beside him are the bomb which he was about to
throw and a tiny French-English dictionary. May we
not say that he has witnessed with his blood to the friendship
of two great nations?</p>

<p>Beside another, who has been hideously wounded,
the wind turns over the leaves of a soldier's Bible.</p>

<p>But enough! My eyes can bear no more. And I
hasten away from this scene, over which, like the sound
of mighty organs, the great guns chant their huge and
terrible chorus.</p>

<p>To free ourselves from this nightmare we went to visit
the gunners in their shelters. It was three in the afternoon,
and we had only just discovered that we had
not yet lunched. A big fellow, who chattered like a
magpie and was built like a Hercules, lit two candles
for us, stirred the fire which was crackling in an earthen
stove, spread a newspaper for our table-cloth, and offered
us a seat on a case of jam-jars. Our sandwiches seemed
delicious; our tea, the best in the world; our hovel, a
palace; our candles, an illumination.</p>

<p>A joy, hitherto unknown, in being merely alive gave
a priceless quality to the smallest pleasures of existence.
We listened with the most intense interest and an unaccustomed
delight to the talkative soldier, while he
instructed us about the price of sugar in England.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, his battery, just beside us, went on killing
Germans.</p>

into a brown study, and I fancied that he was back upon
that hill by Beaucourt. "Come, come!" I said. "What

<p>"I am thinking," the Englishman replied, "that we are
bound to avoid war if we can, but that when war comes we
are bound to meet it like men."</p>

<p class="chaptitle">THE WELDING OF FRENCH AND BRITISH.</p>


<p>Not all things can be welded together. There are
metals which are wholly unsympathetic, and even for
those which are not we require the services of the plumber
and his solder.</p>

<p>It is the glory and the good fortune of the British
and French Armies that, from the first day of the war,
they have shown themselves fitted&mdash;and eager&mdash;to become
one; and that they have discovered, to this end
(and continue daily to employ them), plumbers of the
first class and lead in abundance.</p>

<p>Let us understand one another. To say "joining,"
"soldering," is not to say "fusion," and the theory of
united action upon a united front does not necessarily
imply that out of two friends a single individual is
wrought. A <i>poilu</i> might say that it is possible to be
very good comrades without sleeping in the same bed.</p>

<p>For Germany such fusion would have been a danger,
and she has always avoided it. Although she has carried
her partnership with her allies to the length of making
them her slaves, she has been very careful to allow
nothing like a mingling of breeds in the forces which
are at her disposal. The German Army has, for instance,
resisted every temptation to admit into its ranks
any of its Austrian friends. For it believes that it is
possible to be too friendly.</p>

<p>Germany has confined herself, where this is in question,
to giving her weakened allies no more help than
can be obtained from her officers, commissioned and non-commissioned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
or from the specialised activities of her
artillery and engineers. Beyond this she has but one
thought&mdash;at any cost to insure unity of action between
her forces and those of her allies.</p>

<p>From this it follows that to bring about a real fusion
of two or more allied armies upon one front is a tactical
achievement of the first importance. Such a fusion&mdash;the
essential condition of all united effort that is to
possess a real value&mdash;becomes, from its very nature, the
principal object of the enemy's attack. The history of
this war shows, if one may say so, nothing but a series
of attempts, upon one side or the other, to prevent or
destroy the cohesion of the opposing forces. (Mons;
the first and second Battles of Ypres; the Russian-Rumanian
Armies and the Army of the East; the junction
of the Italians near Vallona with the Army of
Salonika, etc.) But it is not enough that this fusion
should exist. It is also vital&mdash;as we shall presently see
in the case of the Franco-British forces&mdash;that it should
be both elastic and solid.</p>

<p>Since it is agreed that in war-time each month counts
as a year, we may say that it is now two months since
the French and British Armies celebrated their silver
wedding. Age has weakened neither the strength nor
the love of the partners to this marriage. We can say
confidently that, since the day when "the contemptible
little Army of General French" first shook hands with
our <i>pioupious</i>, the friendship has never been interrupted.
For all his passionate desire to accomplish the destruction
of the bond which the two countries have willingly exchanged
for their individual liberty, the enemy's efforts
have been fruitless.</p>

<p>Even during the gloomy days of the retreat from
Mons and Charleroi the union of the two Armies remained
unimpaired. While one of them, overwhelmed
by numbers, found itself compelled to retire, the other,
without any proper understanding of the reason, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
with no thought for anything but the maintenance of
the connection, complied at once with the man&oelig;uvre,
though not without exacting a heavy toll from its enemies.</p>

<p>A few days later the victory of the Marne was to
reward these mutual sacrifices for the common cause.</p>

<p>A cloud had passed. Others followed. Again and
again the enemy, furious at the perfect understanding
which existed between his opponents and dreading what
the consequences of it might be to himself, determined
to make an end of it. The two battles of Ypres were
the fruit of this resolution, to shatter the unity of the
French and British Armies.</p>

<p>For one moment they believed that they had succeeded.</p>

<p>This was on the 24th April, 1915, when, by the use of
asphyxiating gas, till then unknown to us, they had
driven in one corner of the Ypres salient. We know that
it was the gallantry of the Canadians that saved the day
and closed the opening breach.</p>

<p>Since then the chain has never been weakened. Nay,
in the North it has never been so much as stretched.</p>

<p>This, however, has not been the case with the connection
between the British Army and the main body of the
Armies of France. The continual addition of new units
to the British forces was bound to cause frequent changes,
here, in the geographical distribution of the adjoining
troops. Can France ever forget the day when she learned
that silently, without a hitch, and under the very noses
of the Germans, the British front had suddenly been
extended from Loos to the Somme? A mother who
meets, after years, the son whom she has last seen as
a child, must feel a surprise not unlike that with which
France discovered that the Armies of her Allies had
become so large. Who knows but that we may soon be
again delighted in the same way? I say "delighted,"
not "surprised," for our Allies have taught us to forget
to be astonished by anything they may do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>And so, every time that the British front is extended,
this elasticity of the fusion of the Armies is to be observed.</p>

<p>It is clear that these rearrangements can in no way
affect its solidity, since it is this very fusion which has
made possible not only the terrific offensive of the 1st July
last, but also its uninterrupted prosecution.</p>

<p>Only a very happy combination of circumstances
could have brought about this miracle&mdash;for it is one&mdash;which
to explain is to show that it must last as long as
the war shall go on.</p>

<p>First of all, it is due to the perfect understanding
which exists between the General Staffs of the two Allied
Armies. It is, indeed, an achievement to set men of
different races, if of equal courage, side by side. But
this is not enough. Much more need is there of a unity
of command which shall see that the best use is made of
all this determination, brought together from sources
so widely sundered, so that the utmost measure of mutual
support and cohesion may result from the efforts of units
which, though they work alongside of one another, are
strangers. Now it is this very thing which is evident
in the combined operations of the British and French
Armies, at all times and particularly since the opening
of the offensive in Picardy. The Commander-in-Chief,
Sir Douglas Haig, and General Foch&mdash;whom one may
perhaps describe as the keystone of the combination&mdash;have
shown themselves, in this connection, to be as good
psychologists as they are tacticians.</p>

<p>The troops of neither nation&mdash;and this should be made
very clear&mdash;have in any case experienced the smallest
embarrassment in following out the commands of their
leaders. Whenever either English or French have been
able to give one another any kind of support, they have
done it faithfully and readily. The "fusion" is not a
thing of maps; it is not to be found in this place or that;
it is a spiritual verity.</p>

<p>Living side by side, dying under one another's eyes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
English and French are acquiring a mutual respect and
confidence which cannot fail to strengthen their fighting
power.</p>

<p>"After all the proofs of their resolution and intrepidity,"
wrote Field-Marshal French in a report, of
June, 1915, upon the gas attacks, "which our valiant
Allies have given throughout the campaign, it is quite
unnecessary for me to dwell upon this incident, and I
will only express my firm conviction that if there are
any troops on earth who could have held their trenches
in the face of an attack as treacherous as it was unforeseen,
it is the French divisions that would have done it."</p>

<p class="chaptitle">HOW THE AUSTRALIAN CONTINGENT VOTED IN FRANCE IN
FACE OF THE ENEMY.</p>


<p class="rightheader">
8th December, 1916.<br />
</p>

<p>What Frenchman has not met, at least once, in Paris
or some other of our large towns, one of these stout lads
who wear the uniform and carry the equipment of the
British soldier, but are to be distinguished from him by
that khaki-coloured, broad-brimmed felt hat, which the
Boers have immortalised?</p>

<p>Of a height generally above that of the average
Frenchman, with broad shoulders, an alert glance, a free
and easy air; a skin that is often tanned; a horseman from
boyhood, slow to tire, reckless in battles and of a hot temper&mdash;such
is the Australian soldier, one of the world's foremost
fighting men.</p>

<p>His courage, which the enemy regards with a peculiar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
distaste, has earned him heavy fighting everywhere
throughout the war. Let us recall, shortly, some of his
chief performances.</p>

<p>The first division sent by Australia to the assistance
of the Mother Country towards the end of 1914 was
employed on the defences of Egypt and the Suez Canal.
These sterling horsemen did splendid work in this field
of operations, and for four months lived in the desert,
exposed to continual attack.</p>

<p>Next, the Australian troops, augmented by certain
units of New Zealanders, disembarked on the Gallipoli
Peninsula at the left of their English comrades. Hardly
were they on shore before they began a series of battles
which never stopped for a week. They held, at very
great cost, the bit of ground which had been taken from
the Turks, and during four months two divisions of them
lived, Heaven knows how, on a space of less than a third
of an acre.</p>

<p>Then came the Evacuation of Gallipoli. The
Australians returned to Egypt, there to rest between
December, 1915, and the 1st of April, 1916, on which
day they made their appearance on the Western front.</p>

<p>Since that time the Australians have fought on
French soil.</p>

<p>They have to thank their splendid reputation that
they are always to be found wherever the most glory is
to be won. It was they who took Pozières, during the
Somme offensive, and the farm at Mouquet, and measured
their strength, throughout those epic days, against
that of the Prussian Guard.</p>

<p>Such is the Army which, quite recently, has held its
Elections under the very guns of the Germans.</p>

<p>For this Army, whose valour is already almost
legendary, is also among the most democratic Armies
of the world. No one is more jealous of his independence
than the Australian. If he loves and admires his
comrades-in-arms, the French <i>poilus</i>, it is, no doubt,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
because, having long misunderstood them, after the
fashion of strangers towards all things French, he cannot
to-day find words enough to do justice to their military
qualities and their unselfish courage. But it is also,
and, above all, because his heart goes out naturally to
the French people under arms, to this democracy which
in so many ways resembles his own country, Australia
the Free. Like the French soldier, the Australian loves
his fun; like him, he is light-hearted, always singing.
And each of them glories in the knowledge that beneath
his soldier's uniform is a citizen and an elector of a
noble country.</p>

<p>These reflections will help us to understand why the
Australian Government has been led to hold a referendum
of its Expeditionary Force in France.</p>

<p>As you know, the people of Australia were concerned
with the business of deciding for or against the introduction
of compulsory military service into their country.
Mr. Hughes, the Premier of New South Wales, who did
France the honour to visit it at the beginning of this year,
was the originator of this referendum. The result, for
reasons which I will presently mention, was a majority
against conscription for Australia.</p>

<p>To enable the Australian contingent to vote was the
simplest thing in the world. Voting booths were prepared
at Contay, a small village between the Ancre and
the Somme, close to the firing-line. As fast as the
sections left the trenches to go back into billets, each
officer, non-commissioned officer and man was given two
voting papers. On one the word "Yes" was printed;
on the other, "No." The voting lasted a month&mdash;the
time between reliefs&mdash;at the end of which period about
100,000 papers had been collected in the ballot-boxes at
Contay. It is strange that the majority of the Australian
contingent voted against compulsory service for Australia.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Let no one imagine that it was because these heroes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
have become opponents of the war; nor is it even because
they think that their country has done enough.</p>

<p>They have voted against compulsory service, first of
all, for a reason of a general nature, which applies to the
whole of this body of Australian electors&mdash;namely, because
the Australians have a horror of all moral compulsion
and a burning love of liberty. These soldiers have
also been influenced by another objection: they fear
lest to introduce a professional Army into Australia may
be to infect their nation with a spirit of militarism which
is not at all to their taste.</p>

<p>And the proof that the negative result of the referendum
has in no way weakened the determination of
Australia to pursue the war to a victorious end and in
complete accord with the Mother Country, is that, on
the one hand, the Australian contingent persists, after,
as before, recording its vote, in splendidly performing its
duty at the front; and that, on the other hand, Australia
continues to send to the battlefields of Europe thousands
of fresh volunteers.</p>

<p>Hurrah for Liberty! Down with the Boches! In
this motto the quality of the Australian troops is perfectly
expressed. This quality one meets with again in
the war song, the species of <i>Marseillaise</i>, which the Australians
sing to-day when they are on the march in
France.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_2III" id="CHAPTER_2III">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">BOELCKE'S LAND OF PROMISE.</p>


<p>On the 28th of October, six Halberstadters and Aviatiks
attacked two English aviators in the neighbourhood
of Pozières. During the fight six fresh enemy machines
came to the assistance of their friends. At the end of
five minutes of furious fighting two German machines
collided. Pieces of the machines fell, and one of them
descended toward the East. The fight lasted 15 minutes,
at the end of which time all the enemy machines were
driven off.</p>

<p>It is probable that it was during this fight that Captain
Boelcke was killed. It was, in fact, at this date
that the German wireless stated that Boelcke had been
killed owing to a collision in the air.</p>

<p>In a letter which he wrote to a friend a few days
before his tragic and still unaccountable death, Boelcke,
the best-known and most successful of the German aviators,
said:</p>

<p>"The Somme front is a positive land of promise. The
sky is filled with English airmen."</p>

<p>Boelcke expressed, under the guise of a kind of sporting
self-congratulation, the astonishment of his fellows
at the way in which the British flying service had developed.</p>

<p>A large number of documents found upon German
prisoners give evidence of a no less striking kind upon the
same point.</p>

<p>"Our air service," says one of them, "practically
ceased to exist during the Battle of the Somme. At
times the sky seemed black with enemy machines."</p>

<p>Another says:</p>

<p>"We are so inferior to our opponents in our air service
that when hostile machines fly over our own lines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
we have no recourse but to hide ourselves in the earth.
Now and then a few of our machines attempt to go up,
but it is only a drop in the bucket."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i07large.jpg"><img src="images/i07.jpg" width="400" height="591" alt="" /></a>
<div class="caption"><p>6. A BRITISH AEROPLANE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Finally, for one must not pursue this subject too far,
a General Order has been issued to the German Army to
the effect that when troops are marching they must halt
and take cover whenever a British machine is known to
be in their vicinity; for the English are in the habit
of flying sufficiently low over the invaded territory to
use their machine-guns against moving troops and convoys.</p>

<p>To this evidence from enemy sources I may perhaps
add my own. I assert, then, as definitely as it is possible
to do it, that one of my most agreeable surprises,
during my visit to the British front, was the discovery
of the great numbers and unceasing activity of the British
aeroplanes. Whether I was in the firing-line or behind
it, my attention was being constantly drawn to the movements
of the British air service.</p>

<p>On the 15th of September the total number of hours
during which flying was carried on upon the British front
was 1,300. Reckoning that each aviator flies, on an
average, for two hours, it is possible to form an idea
of the number of machines which were in the air on that
day.</p>

<p>During the last Battle of the Ancre the British planes
of every kind, for bombing, fighting and directing the
gunfire, seemed always to be over the German lines; and
on one fairly still day I was able to count as many
as 30 of them in the air at once, and this on a comparatively
narrow sector.</p>

<p>Behind the lines I went to see numerous aviation
camps, instruction camps, depôts of munitions, etc. They
were like so many beehives, models of organisation,
order and method. The pilots, the observers, the
mechanics, everyone, seen at close quarters, gave me an
impression of a very unusual power and intelligence, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
inspired me with the same confidence with which their
own mastery of the air has so long filled them, ever since,
indeed, they wrested it from the enemy.</p>

<p>Perhaps it may not be labour lost if, in order to get
a right understanding of the present very satisfactory and
praiseworthy position, we review shortly the history of
British military aviation since the beginning of the war.</p>

<p>England had not wished for war, nor had she prepared
for it, and while aviation seemed to her a marvellous
achievement of the human brain, she was far from
thinking that she was bound to make use of it in order
to injure mankind. This is why her military air service,
like her whole Army, was in no more than an embryonic
condition when she found herself faced with the grim
reality of this war.</p>

<p>Far more than the exigencies of the campaign on the
continent, it was the repeated raids of the Zeppelins over
England which caused her to devote herself to the development
of her aviation.</p>

<p>The undertaking bristled with difficulties. We
should be wrong, were we in France, to suppose that we
are the only people the story of whose aviation has been
marked by crises. Our Allies, though their practical
nature is proverbial among us, were forced to experiment
and grope their way for a long time before they could
arrive at a solution of the many knotty problems of
aerial defence.</p>

<p>A complete lack of any central authority, a division
or responsibility between the various staffs, nobody to
decide as to how machines should be employed or how
built, waste of every kind&mdash;the English have experienced
all these troubles. But how admirably they have surmounted
them! The proof is that now the only
resource of the Germans is a servile imitation.</p>

<p>This spirit of imitation among the Germans has shown
itself most markedly in these last weeks, during the process
of the Battle of the Ancre. The Germans set out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
by collecting a large number of aeroplanes on a very
narrow front. Then they began to show some signs of
taking the initiative with a daring to which we were little
accustomed.</p>

<p>Did they really hope to wrest the mastery of the air
from the English? I do not know. In any case their
attempt began badly; for when, 40 in number, they met
30 of the British machines, they could discover no better
way of saving themselves than by flight, after a quarter
of their number had been put out of action.</p>

<p>It was about this time that General von Groener, a
man of energy and resolution, called upon the German
aeroplane factories to increase their output; and that Mr.
Lloyd George in England, while giving publicity to this
new effort of Germany, exhorted his fellow-countrymen
not to allow themselves to be overtaken by their enemy.</p>

<p>Boelcke may rest in peace. His land of promise can
only grow greater and breed birds more rapidly.</p>

<p>After this, what need one say more of the technical
skill and the often heroic courage of the British aviator?</p>

<p>The French and British airmen form, indeed, one
great family of heroes, and our men have, in King
George's Army, cousins who are as like them as brothers.</p>

<p>At this point I will do no more than offer for your
consideration a document and a story.</p>

<p>The document is a letter, sent from Germany to his
friends by an English aviator, Lieutenant Tudor-Hart,
on the 25th of this July. I should blame myself were I
to alter one word of it.</p>

<p>"I was," he writes, "with Captain Webb at between
12,000 and 15,000 feet above the German lines, when
we saw eight German machines coming towards us from
the South-west. They were higher than we were, and
we went towards them to attack them. Two of them
passed about 300 yards above our heads. I opened fire
on one and they replied together.</p>

<p>"I signed to Webb to turn so that I might fire at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
other machine, behind us; but he made a spurt forward
with the machine. I looked round to see what had happened,
but Webb pointed to his stomach and fell forward
upon the controls. I fancy he must have died almost
immediately. His last thought had been to save the
machine.</p>

<p>"It at once began to swing in the direction of the
German lines, and I was compelled to return to my
machine-gun, in order to fire on a plane which was getting
too close. The other machines never stopped firing at
us. My only hope was to make for our lines, but I
could not manage to push Webb out of the pilot's seat,
and I was obliged to man&oelig;uvre above the hood.</p>

<p>"I had to fire so often that it became impossible for
me to guide the machine. At last, constantly under fire,
I planed down towards a field near by and tried to land.
I saw a number of men with rifles, and I thought that I
might be killed before being able to set the machine on
fire.</p>

<p>"One wing having struck the earth, the machine was
smashed, and I was thrown out. I got off with one side
paralysed, one ankle and one rib broken. I was very
well treated, and the German flying men behaved towards
me like sportsmen and gentlemen."</p>

<p>It is in this way that the paladins of this war both conduct
and express themselves.</p>

<p>And now for the story.</p>

<p>There was once in England a rich man who interested
himself in Art and Politics. His name was Lord Lucas.
Life had always smiled upon him, and he had returned
her smile. Had he wished it, he might have spent his
life in slippered ease and lived from day to day without
a care.</p>

<p>Choosing, rather, to become a soldier, he joined the
Expeditionary Forces during the South African War.
He was wounded and lost a leg, but this in no way
deterred him from being of service to his country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p>When the European War broke out, Lord Lucas was
the Minister for Agriculture in the Asquith Cabinet.</p>

<p>He felt shame to be engaged in such a vapid business
as Politics now appeared, and he resigned. Next we
find him volunteering for the British air service. In
spite of his artificial leg, he went through his training,
was hurt, got cured, and returned to his work and never
rested until he had flown over the German lines. One
day Lord Lucas, millionaire, artist, ex-Cabinet Minister,
and, above all, soldier, failed to return to his squadron.
The Boches alone know whether he is dead or a prisoner.</p>

<p>The man who told me the story of this splendid life
was the best friend of Lord Lucas, and he was worthy
to be it. I asked this soldier, a peer himself and himself
wounded, if in England, as in France, commissions in
the air service were much sought after. In reply, he
pointed to two great birds, and said: "We admire them,
Monsieur, as you do, and, like you, we envy them."</p>

<p class="chaptitle">THE SQUARE JAW.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> Of the two articles which follow, the first ("The Square Jaw")
was written on the 9th of December, during the crisis caused by the
successive resignations of Mr. Lloyd George and Mr. Asquith.
</p>
<p>
The second ("The Moral of the British Armies") was written on
the 19th of the same month, the day after Germany made her
official offer of peace.</p></div>


<p>The British soldier does not concern himself with
Politics. It is not in his character to do so; moreover,
any such conduct is against the rules of his profession.
And so, since discipline "is the first weapon of Armies,"
the British soldier respects it above everything else.</p>

<p>The Englishman has a passion and a profound respect
for method. Method requires that Politics should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
be the business of Ministers and Politicians, and that war
should be carried on by soldiers. Method, says the
Englishman, demands that everyone should stick to his
own work and his own place. Without this, anarchy
must ensue. Now there cannot well be anything less
anarchical than the British Army.</p>

<p>It is their order and discipline which most powerfully
and most quickly impress the Frenchman who is permitted
to live for a time among the Armies of England.
These qualities, let me hasten to add, are also the least
superficial, and thus afford the surest test of the value
of these Armies.</p>

<p>Observe that it is not by collecting together a body
of indifferent natures, passive temperaments and personalities
more or less irresponsible, that this order and discipline
have been infused into the British Army. The level
of capacity of this Army is, moreover, by no means a
low one; for it is one of the most intelligent Armies in
Europe or in the whole world. The common soldier is
not of one class, to the exclusion of all others. He does
not represent one section only of British opinion. His
corporate mind is therefore in no way a limited one.</p>

<p>As a volunteer, he thronged into England, at the beginning
of the war, from every quarter of the globe, and
by this voluntary act at once proclaimed his intelligence.
To-day, as a conscript, he represents, more than ever
before, the completeness of his country's will.</p>

<p>As for the officers, who differ from our own in their
essentially aristocratic character, in them we see the direct
expression of all those qualities of brain and heart which
distinguish the leading elements of British society.</p>

<p>And so, if this army does not concern itself with
Politics, if it is thoroughly disciplined, if it contents
itself with "making war," it is because it prefers to do
these things.</p>

<p>It is, moreover, excellently informed of everything
which happens outside itself, whether in England or elsewhere,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
and in this respect differs considerably from the
German Army which lies beyond its trenches. A Boche
prisoner, recently taken, owned that neither the newspapers
of his country nor any letters ever reached the
German troops in the front lines. As each day comes,
its history is told to our enemies by word of mouth only;
that is to say, after the fashion which best suits their
rulers.</p>

<p>Among the English there is very little heard or said
about peace, or about the objects for which they are fighting;
but they read, and they read continually. The soldier
follows the course of events as well in his letters as in his
newspaper.</p>

<p>And in what does his knowledge consist? What does
he know?</p>

<p>He knows that the Army to which he belongs owes
much to that French Army which he admires so deeply,
and by whose side he is proud to fight for the interests
which their natures share. He knows that to the British
Army is secured, from now onwards, one of the chief
factors of invincible and victorious strength&mdash;numbers.
He knows approximately the number of his effectives,
and he would gladly, by crying it aloud, shake the confidence
of the enemy and confirm that of his friends.</p>

<p>He knows also that the second factor of his strength&mdash;material&mdash;while
it is already considerable and probably
equal to that which his opponents possess&mdash;does not
represent a quarter of what the coming year will produce.
He knows, from having done it again and again
since July, that not only can he resist the enemy, but
defeat him; and he awaits confidently the hour of
triumph.</p>

<p>Hence his firm, his unshakable determination to obtain
victory on his own terms; hence, also, it follows that no
thought or hope of a premature peace ever disturbs his
mind.</p>

<p>And if no one else remained to fight, he would go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
on, for&mdash;he says it himself, and one cannot but believe
him&mdash;he has "a square jaw."</p>

<p>It is important, in the present condition of affairs,
that the French public should make no mistake as to
the opinions of the British soldier concerning the war
and its sure conclusion.</p>

<p>About this no one can be under any delusion. Everywhere
on the British front there is but one opinion&mdash;that
the war must be carried through to the end; that is to
say, till the inevitable victory of the Allies has come
to pass; and that it would be a crime against the Homeland,
the Allies and those comrades who have fallen, to
listen to proposals for a peace which would be consistent
with neither the intentions nor the interests of England
and her Allies.</p>

<p>During my visit of two months I have seen the larger
part of the British front from the Somme to the Yser.
Everywhere I have met with the same spirit of determination.
This state of mind may be explained in various
ways; the perfect confidence which the British Army
feels in its Commander-in-Chief, Sir Douglas Haig, "the
lucky," as the soldiers call him; the regular growth in
the numbers of the effectives, which, though I may not
disclose these figures, exceed the estimates of them
usually made in France; the tremendous development of
material and in the output of munitions; the magnificent
successes gained on the Somme and the Ancre, which have
given rise to the certainty of being able to defeat an
enemy formerly said to be invincible; etc., etc.</p>

<p>Without doubt, the war goes slowly. Tommy admits
it, but he begs you to observe&mdash;and justly&mdash;that on every
occasion when his infantry has come to grips with the
Germans it has invariably beaten them.</p>

<p>"Besides," he thinks, "perhaps it is not absolutely
essential, in order to win the war and place England and
her Allies in a position to dictate their own terms, that
our Armies should hurl themselves forward in one final<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
and costly advance over the shattered lines of the
Germans." The British soldier is fond of comparing
the Western battle front to an immense boxing ring, of
which the complex systems of barbed wire which stretch
from the North Sea to Belfort form the ropes. The war,
on the West, has been fought within these limits since
the Marne. It is possible that it will see no change of
position up to the end.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

<div class="caption"><p>7. CANADIANS FRESH FROM THE TRENCHES.</p></div>
</div>

<p>But, as in a boxing match, it is not necessary, in order
to win, to drive one's opponent over the ropes and out
of the ring; in the same way it may happen that the
German Army is "knocked out" in the positions where
it is fighting to-day.</p>

<p>That, at least, is the opinion of the British soldier.</p>

<p>It is, indeed, no more than a paraphrase of that dictum,
pronounced not long ago by General Nogi, and
as true of the ring as it is of war: "Complete victory
is to him who can last a quarter of an hour longer than
the other fellow."</p>

<p>Tommy has no intention&mdash;no more than has his friend
the <i>poilu</i>&mdash;of playing the part of "the other fellow."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_2V" id="CHAPTER_2V">CHAPTER V.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE RELIEF.</p>


<p>The scene is an old trench of the French first line.
It is midday. It is raining. It goes on raining. It has
always rained. The sector is fairly quiet, and has been
for an hour or so. Tommy sees a chance to write a letter.</p>

<p>Here in his dug-out&mdash;a miserable shelter which oozes
water everywhere&mdash;squatted on the straw that becomes
filth the moment it is thrown down, he is telling his
friends in Scotland all his small sorrows and hopes; he
is wishing them "A Happy New Year."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly his pen falters; the writer considers, stops
writing, and, addressing the second-lieutenant as he goes
by: "Beg pardon, sir," he asks, "may I say that they
have moved out?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not," says the lieutenant, apparently horrified
by such a question. "It is absolutely forbidden to
say anything about this business. Do you understand,
all of you?"</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but," someone ventures to say, "everyone in
England knows about it already. The papers ..."
and they show the lieutenant some newspapers which have
come that morning. The officer takes them, glances at
them, smiles, and says: "Oh, these journalists!"</p>

<p>On the front page of the paper a striking photograph
is exhibited, showing an incident of the taking over by
the British of the French front. Underneath is the following
description:</p>

<p>"Tommy takes over the French trenches. French
soldiers looking on at the arrival of British troops who
are relieving them. This important operation took place
at the front, at Christmas-time, silently, secretly and
with complete success. The enemy, who was in many
places no more than a few yards distant, never had any
suspicion of this change, which has greatly extended the
British lines and eased the strain which our gallant Allies
have endured upon the Western front.</p>

<p>"This military man&oelig;uvre affords the best reply to the
man&oelig;uvres of Germany in the direction of peace."</p>

<p>And so Tommy continues his letter in some such
fashion as this:</p>

<p>"Now that the thing is done, I may tell you that
we have left the sector of &mdash;&mdash; in order to come down
farther South, where we have relieved the French. It has
been a fine chance to see our brave Allies at work, and I
am tremendously proud to have taken their place in the
lines.</p>

<p>"The thing has been done very well, although it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
wanted a lot of care and was very dangerous. You can
imagine that if the Boches had had any notion of what
we were at, they would not have failed to do their level
best to stop us or make it difficult for us; for it must
make them very savage to see our 'contemptible little
Army' always extending its flanks, without wearing
thin anywhere, and so setting free first-rate troops for
the French to use elsewhere.</p>

<p>"We came among the Frenchmen on Christmas Day.</p>

<p>"The roads were all as busy as on the day before the
offensive on the Ancre in front of Beaumont-Hamel. We
never stopped meeting French troops and wagons, which
were going back towards the railway.</p>

<p>"We exchanged civilities with the <i>poilus</i> which neither
they nor we understood the least bit. But I may tell
you that it was pretty clear to me that they were not sorry
to be giving up their places to us.</p>

<p>"On the 25th of December, after supper, we left our
last camp and marched through the night for many
hours, till we came to this French trench where I am
writing to you now.</p>

<p>"The <i>poilus</i> were at their posts. It'll be a long time
before I forget that sight.</p>

<p>"Although they were far dirtier and more tired than
were we, the French, as they themselves say, 'had the
smile.' If we had been allowed to make any noise, we
should have cheered them. But we were only 38 yards
from the Boche line.</p>

<p>"The officers and the non-commissioned officers gave
the orders in whispers. They had interpreters to help
them.</p>

<p>"As for me, I was at once told off to do sentry in the
place of a great French chap, with a beard, who was a
good 15 years older than I.</p>

<p>"As I understood a bit of French, I was able to make
out most of what he said to me.</p>

<p>"'Good evening, my lad,' says he. 'You're a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
fellow to come and let me out of this. Shake hands,
won't you?'&mdash;I didn't understand everything; French is
so difficult&mdash;and he added: 'And now, young 'un, open
your eyes and keep them skinned.'</p>

<p>"Then he gave me a great deal of very sound advice,
showing me in which directions I must keep a good look-out,
and telling me to have a care of a blackguardly
German machine-gun which never has done sweeping
their parapet.</p>

<p>"When he had finished with this he took his rifle out
of the loophole, and I put mine there in its place. And
that's how the big relief was carried out on Christmas
night."</p>

<p>At this point Tommy was forced to interrupt his long
letter, for the Germans had at last got news of the relief
and were attacking the sector. In vain.</p>

<p>Next day Tommy finished thus:</p>

<p>"My <i>poilu</i> was right. This corner can hardly be
called a quiet one, and Fritz is a bad boy, there's no
doubt about it. Thanks for your Christmas parcel. The
pudding was A1. Good-bye.</p>

<p class="center">THE ARMIES OF THE NORTH.</p>


<p>Flat calm on both sides of the Ancre; calm&mdash;or
something like it&mdash;on the Somme. Let us take advantage
of this apparent truce to get into rather closer touch
with the British Army.</p>

<p>By this eight-day tour (though it has seemed, while
we have been making it, a kind of intermezzo between two
acts of the offensive) we had intended, particularly, to
demonstrate to ourselves, by our study of the events and
those who have enacted them, the dauntless determination
with which our Allies, not satisfied to defend the
heroic heritage which these battlefields of 1915 have bequeathed
to them, now prepare for the future.</p>

<p>In telling these experiences, one has to play the
Censor over oneself. And so we may say nothing of
the most important things of all. Everywhere throughout
this countryside mighty Armies, in the most perfect
secrecy, are doing their business, scattering, with prodigal
hand, the seed of future victory. And the harvest
will surely be gathered. And if, at this time of heart-breaking
uncertainty, our journey enables us to do no
more than declare that great things are assuredly preparing,
this alone will make it worth our having undertaken
it.</p>

<p>We did not set out, we three, with our permits from
the General Headquarters, to make a sentimental pilgrimage
over the battlefields that lie between Lorette and
the trenches of French Flanders. No; it was a reconnaissance
that we made&mdash;into the Future. These sketches
of the British Armies are, thus, no more than a study of
latent forces.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_3I" id="CHAPTER_3I">CHAPTER I.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE PREPARATION OF THE CANADIANS.</p>


<p>We spent the first two days among the Canadians.
Let me recall a few of their performances. They sustained,
in front of Ypres, the first great gas attack
launched by the Germans. During the offensive in
Picardy, being sent into the front line on the 15th of
September or thereabouts, they stormed Courcelette and
Martinpuich, and consolidated their forward positions on
one side towards Grandcourt, on the other towards Le
Sars. The rest of them kept the enemy contained.</p>

<p>To sum them up&mdash;an Army full of robust qualities,
an Army of young athletes, inured by their own home-life
to the physical hardships of the trenches, regardless
alike of cold, fog and mud. An Army, too, of formidable
size, since to-day its numbers are greater than those
of the whole British Expeditionary Force of 1914.</p>

<p>We saw them in their lines&mdash;in camp. Our guides
were certain young officers from Quebec, who spoke an
archaic, melodious French, that was most pleasant to
hear. Their names also sounded oddly in our ears;
more than one of them recalled the old sailor names of
Cherbourg, Saint Malo and Lorient. They told us what
joy they found in fighting for their two Homelands&mdash;England
and France.</p>

<p>While we were crossing a wood near A&mdash;&mdash;, one of
them told me, gravely: "I have been here since our good
God made the little apples to grow, but I have known
neither regret nor weariness. Rather has this life in
France this springhead of my race, made me know myself
each day more truly."</p>

<p>These men and their leaders, indeed, do neither their
training nor their fighting from any other motive than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
duty. Their fighting has a kind of mystical quality, the
passion of a young people, which makes them, behind
their battle lines, a family of brothers, and, when they
engage, an army of warriors who will lay down their
lives for one another.</p>

<p>A few miles from the enemy, behind a redoubt,
where thousands of French graves lie scattered, one of their
divisions occupied some huts which our engineers had built.
Almost everywhere the notices were written in French.
In one immense system there were trenches of a hundred
shapes all jumbled together. We saw, here, a demonstration
of a surprise attack against a machine-gun emplacement
on a redoubt of the German pattern. This
man&oelig;uvre was no more than an illustration of theory.
The captain who had charge of it had, during the previous
night, himself led an attack against the Germans. From it
he had returned with three things&mdash;a slight wound, two
prisoners and the Military Cross.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, at the edge of a mine-crater, we listened
to a lieutenant grounding his men in the art of trench-digging.
A trench should be made irregularly, in
accordance with the natural variations of the soil. All
of which the lieutenant summed up thus: "To do this
job well you must do it badly."</p>

<p>A company of Canadian gunners were practising with
a trench-digging machine, invented in England, which
had done well on the Somme. Suddenly one of them,
to his horror, perceived that a shell which stood among
a hundred others was smoking. By some unaccountable
means its fuse had caught fire, the match was burning,
and in a few seconds, perhaps in one, the shell would
burst. Were it to do so, the whole of this store of
ammunition must go aloft, with the gunners and us and
all.</p>

<p>And so this gallant little Canadian who has seen the
danger, gives the alarm, and while we flatten ourselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
into the mud, picks up the shell in his plucky hands
and throws it with all his strength out in front of the
battery, where it bursts&mdash;and no one a penny the worse.</p>

<p>We could have fallen, for very joy, upon the neck
of the gallant lad who had just saved all our lives. It
would have been so silly to be killed in such a fashion,
miles away from the enemy!</p>

<p>Farther on they were learning to handle a new trench-mortar.
We were privileged to observe a little <i>barrage</i>
fire. It made a noble shindy in the fog and a magnificent
disturbance of the soil. These guns have been only recently
introduced, but they are installing great numbers
of them along the whole British front with a view to
the winter campaign, for they have been an immense
success. The Germans, in this field, at least, of experimental
operations, have acquired this information at
considerable cost to themselves.</p>

<p>In the same way we followed the open-air training of
the machine-gun men. More or less every man has to
go through it, so that if necessary he may be able to do
this work. It is the picked gunners, who have shown
what they can do in actual fighting, who teach the beginners
the use of this terrible weapon, and it is with a
most entertaining air of "the old soldier" that they give
their instruction.</p>

<p>We saw the periscope rifles at work, the bomb-throwing
and grenade-throwing rifles and other strange and terrible
weapons of which one may not tell. What a rare museum
we will be able to make up after the war! The collections
of arms from the Middle Ages will sink into insignificance
beside it. It would appear that for inventing ways of killing
his fellows, the imagination of Man knows no bounds.</p>

<p>We came upon some sturdy Canadians, their hats
stuck in their belts. A stout band of leather was round
their heads. Slung across his shoulders one carried two
heavy boxes loaded with shells; another, without any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
effort, carried one of his comrades. These exercises were
explained to us in this way. "It is the method of the
Red Indians that the Canadians have cleverly adapted
to the purposes of supplying their trenches or carrying
their wounded. With it, one has no need to be a
Hercules." With this system, strength yields to skill.
They showed us a man who can in this way walk easily
with a piano on his back. "It would come in handy for
shifting a broken-down tank!" said our guide with a
grin.</p>

<p>Here we are at the Canadian Headquarters, an 18th-century
château whose walls are hung with early Flemish
masters.</p>

<p>"France sends us welcome guests."</p>

<p>The man who gives us this genial reception is none
other than General Byng, Commander-in-Chief of the
Canadian detachment in France. He is a handsome
fellow, slender, solidly built. In him an immense
strength is found united to an exquisite courtesy.</p>

<p>Hardly have we become his guests before he is showing
his confidence in us by permitting us to share in his
secrets.</p>

<p>He has brought us in front of a huge map representing
the field of his operations. On it he shows us, with
a most worthy pride, the dispositions of all his divisions,
brigades and battalions.</p>

<p>While we are chatting, an officer of the Intelligence
comes in. He has an unfortunate piece of news for the
general, and so for us&mdash;the fall of Bucharest.</p>

<p>"At dawn this morning," he says, "the Boches began
cheering in their trenches. Then they pushed up above
their parapets placards which told us that the Rumanian
capital had been taken. Also, one of our listening-posts
got a German wireless put purposely into English, which
said: 'Bucharest is taken. Hurrah!'"</p>

<p>For a serious moment or two we are silent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>Then someone ventures: "That's a nuisance!"</p>

<p>Another silence. The square jaws set a little more
firmly. Then: "Carry on!" says our host.</p>

<p>Everyone knows that since February of this year this
ancient town has been included in that part of the front
which is held by our Allies.</p>

<p>Soldier or traveller, whoever enters the ruins of Arras,
is subject to the strictest regulations, which have been imposed
for the sake of the security of individuals and
the preservation of the general order. The steel helmet
is obligatory, as is the gas mask.</p>

<p>Numerous notices instruct us "not to move about except
upon the footpaths and hugging the walls. It is absolutely
forbidden to use the middle of the roadway." A
useful precaution in a town whose outskirts are held by
the Germans.</p>

<p>The town is divided into districts. On notice-boards
are posted various directions such as, "Rendezvous Place
No. 1." For there is no longer any Grande Place or
Petit Place or any other spots whose names are known
to the people of Arras&mdash;only Place 1, 2, 3, and so on.</p>

<p>I have noted, in this connection, the following, as a
novel example of organisation and forethought:</p>

<p>"To civilians. You are not required to concern yourselves
with military matters. If you talk about such
things, you may come under suspicion."</p>

<p>A civilian warned is a civilian armed.</p>

<p>Such was Arras when I saw it in November, 1914,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
after the first bombardment, and so it was, or nearly so,
when I saw it yesterday. And it was the same sorrow
that I felt as I passed along those empty streets, where
not one house is to be seen that has not received its wound,
more or less mortal. The dismal impression may
have been strengthened by yesterday's wretched
weather.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>8. ARRAS.</p></div>
</div>

<p>We often say of some provincial town: "It is a dead-alive
place." The phrase should be changed, or else it
should be used henceforth only about such towns as
Arras, Ypres or Verdun.</p>

<p>For two years not only the Germans but the weather
also have been active to help the work of destruction;
the Germans with their never-ceasing bombardment, the
weather by destroying without hope buildings which
might, till lately, have perhaps been saved. Everything
rusts and crumbles under the rain, and in many places
the wind has finished their work for the guns. Grass
sprouts among the ruins; moss grows on stone and
timber. The work of Death goes on, slowly but
surely.</p>

<p>It is not a little astonishing to meet civilians now and
then in Arras. Here and there the white head of some
old man or woman appears from a cellar or from behind
a bit of wall. There are some hundreds of such French
people, who have refused to leave their homes.</p>

<p>They have sent away the "<i>jeunesse</i>," as they say, so
that the Boches may have no more children to kill. They,
the old folk, propose to stay and look after their
ruins.</p>

<p>Yesterday I saw a woman come out of the half-open
door of a little shop. She may have been 65 years old.
Over the door was the sign, "Washing done here." She
was a washerwoman.</p>

<p>I spoke to her.</p>

<p>"My dear lady," I said, "are you not afraid to stay
here?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>"Bah, Monsieur!" she replied. "A little sooner, a
little later. What does it matter at my age?</p>

<p>"I had a grandson," she went on. "He was just 20
when the Boches came. They killed him close by here
in 1914. My girl died of grief. The father is fighting
somewhere or other. And so I came back. Here at least
I can go now and then to pray for my boy. But not beside
his grave. The Boches are <i>there</i>. That's where it is,
Monsieur, on the other side of the road."</p>

<p>And she pointed to where the enemy lay, close by.</p>

<p>He is there, close by. You feel him; you hear him.
For two years he has held the suburbs of Blangy,
Ronville and Saint Sauveur. You hear his firing as if
it was beside you. It is all street fighting here.
In one place, indeed, there is no more than the
width of a little street, four or five yards, between
the trenches.</p>

<p>For the moment, however, this sector is quiet.</p>

<p>The chief amusement of the Boches is incendiarism.
On regular days and at regular hours of the day it
pleases them to light great bonfires in the town. This is
how they manage it.</p>

<p>First they throw a few incendiary bombs at the prey
which they have singled out. When the fire has been
started and the firemen have come running to fight it,
the Boches enliven the situation with shells, in the hope,
I suppose, of feeding the flames with some human
victims.</p>

<p>It is vastly entertaining!</p>

<p>As we came back we made the acquaintance of some
very noteworthy British soldiers. They call them
Bantams.</p>

<p>The distinguishing feature of these men is their height,
which is below the average. There was a certain number
of men in England who had been rejected for service in
the ranks because of their shortness. As they were very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
keen to fight, somebody thought of forming them into
a special division.</p>

<p>And so the Bantam Division came into being. And
these little cocks can fight to the death, like those in
whose battles the villages of Northern England used to
delight; and, little though they are, they grow, if one
may say so, at once to the size of Titans.</p>

<p class="chaptitle">THE GROUND OF HEROIC DEEDS.</p>


<p>Last year the ground that we are treading, this cold
and rainy December day, saw played out one of the most
terrible acts of this terrible war. It shook for weeks
together during May and June, 1915, to the thunder of
vast opposing artilleries. Thousands of men moved over
it and drenched it with their blood.</p>

<p>This ground has seen the French Army, in a transport
of courage, bind for an instant the wings of victory;
it has seen our battalions burst at racing speed over
trenches that were deemed impregnable; it has seen
Petain's men storm the Vimy Ridge and win a sight of
the plain, the goal of their desires, their promised
land....</p>

<p>It has seen that!</p>

<p>I own frankly that, as I write these impressions, I am
in the grip of an emotion which I do not even try to
conquer. Perhaps it is because these events of May and
June, 1915, are already so distant that time has magnified
their tragic splendour till they have acquired a sort of
legendary quality.</p>

<p>We reached this battlefield through the wood of
Bouvigny, which lies to the North-westwards of the crest
of Notre Dame de Lorette. In this wood, which is all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
close thickets and has few large trees, just before the
attack of May, an entire French division succeeded in
gathering without being discovered by the enemy.</p>

<p>You can still see clearly, at the Southern edge of
the wood, the first French trenches, in front of which, in
October, 1914, after the evacuation of Lille, the German
hosts were stopped in their march to the West. The
breaking flood has eaten deeply into the slopes, as the
sea has done along the Breton Coast.</p>

<p>Two years will soon have passed over this devastated
spot. The grass and the moss have begun to take
possession of the abandoned trenches, to conceal the shell-holes
and the dug-outs, to cover up the vast wreckage
of the battle, the dear relics of our soldiers. Nevertheless,
we see everywhere evidence of the madness with
which they fought hereabouts in May and June, 1915.
Years, centuries, I believe, must pass before every sign
of these things will be gone.</p>

<p>No doubt the bones that one often finds scattered here
and there, refused by the ground, will crumble away
and will return little by little to the dust from which
they came; these little nameless crosses, made out of two
sticks of different lengths fastened together, will vanish;
but on the spurs of Lorette, as at Carency, or at Ablain
Saint-Nazaire, there will always be something that will
speak of the spring of 1915&mdash;the ground.</p>

<p>We were anxious to see the ruins of the chapel. We
found them only with great difficulty. At last at the
angle of a trench we came upon its brick foundations and
a small monument, set up since 1915 by some pious hand.
In a frame of wood and corrugated iron are three plaster
figures, the Holy Family, which were formerly in the
chapel, with this inscription:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Memorial of the Holy Family of the Santa Casa
of Notre Dame de Lorette. August, 1916. The
Guides and Protectors of valiant soldiers."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>This monument cannot be said to be erected&mdash;since
it is buried&mdash;but it hides itself away in that part of the
spurs of Lorette whence the eye looks out beyond over
the whole district. In clear weather one sees the whole
panorama of the German and French lines. One can
trace their windings by Angres, Lievin and Lens, and
good eyes can follow them right up to Lille. It is quite
common, at any rate, to see the people of this invaded
piece of France going about their business in the streets
of, for example, Lens.</p>

<p>Opposite, to the East, are the chalky heights of Vimy,
a little higher than the ridge of Lorette, on which we
are standing. Their summits are at present held by the
enemy.</p>

<p>We could not fail, while we were at Ablain, to compare
the effect of the 1915 gunfire with that of 1916.
This comparison can, indeed, be made wherever fighting
had taken place before the Somme offensive.</p>

<p>In the sector of Ablain, Carency and Souchez our
artillery had delivered a weight of shell, in May and
June 1915, such as had never been known before. The
enemy had been stunned by it. Yet, what a different
effect was wrought by the artillery during the Somme
offensive. At either Ablain, Carency or Souchez it is
still possible to see that there is a village, and even
to rebuild it in imagination. The skeletons are still
standing.</p>

<p>But in Fricourt, Mametz, Thiepval and all the other
villages which were under fire in 1916, not one stone remains
upon another. In 1915 it was destruction; in 1916
annihilation. The advance made in the construction of
artillery is written in the soil in unmistakable characters,
and no one who is not an expert can conceive how the
science of levelling things with the earth might be brought
to any greater perfection. Our further advance along
these lines must, one would say, be made downwards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>It is with deep regret that we leave these immense
cities of the dead, where so many Frenchmen sleep under
the sympathetic wardenship of our Allies.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_3IV" id="CHAPTER_3IV">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">A DINNER OF GENERALS.</p>


<p>This evening on our return from the lines we found
the following invitation:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Dear Sir,&mdash;The General in Command will be very
happy if you can dine with him at eight o'clock."</p></blockquote>

<p>We were, to tell you the truth, in such a state of dirtiness,
so horribly muddy and so tired, that at first we
wondered if it was possible for us to accept. But an invitation
from a General&mdash;a General in Command&mdash;amounts
to an order. And so we made a quick toilet
and betook ourselves to the Head Quarters.</p>

<p>They had been established a mile or two from the
little Flemish town, in a <i>château</i> built in the style of
the Italian Renaissance, which we were able, unfortunately,
to admire by moonlight only.</p>

<p>The General, who was surrounded by a brilliant company
of Generals and Colonels, received us in the
drawing-room. He made us welcome in the purest
French, saluting us as the representatives of the Press
of an Ally.</p>

<p>General Horn, commanding the 1st British Army, is
a man about 60 years old. In this command he has
succeeded Sir Douglas Haig, who is now Commander-in-Chief
of the British Forces. He is a tall man with a
youthful carriage. His whole person is instinct with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
the force of a great leader. His eye is cold and stern,
while thick, grizzled brows add to the severity of his
glance. But he is a ready and an agreeable talker. It
is clear that this leader, who holds in his hand the lives
of 200,000 men, is, also, a splendid gentleman.</p>

<p>Once at table we are overwhelmed with attentions.
Our hosts vie with one another in showing kindness to
the Frenchmen. Here are men whose names are already
famous throughout Great Britain; one day this war will
make them known to the whole world.</p>

<p>We meet again, particularly, a number of faces which
we have already encountered during our travels. General
Byng, for instance, whom I have already had the honour
to introduce to you; Curry, a General of Division, a
square-set John Bull in uniform, with eyes that are peculiarly
quick and intelligent. A man of business in time
of peace, he won his General's scabbard during the first
Battle of Ypres. (An English General is to be known
by the crossed scabbard and sword, in gold, on his
epaulettes.)</p>

<p>He said, speaking of this sector of his:</p>

<p>"I am proud to command my men in positions which
you have made glorious." Brave heart! He has wept
for his men. Here again is Brigadier Kitchen; 45, fair,
blue eyes, well set up, a kindly face; he looks like a
younger Kitchener. He has a career behind him, for
he fought in South Africa. Full of fire, he should be
a wonderful leader of men, of the order of Gouraud or
Mangin.</p>

<p>Yet others&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>And we talk. We talk as one talks round a table,
that is, a little about everything. Our hosts listen with
a lively interest to such news&mdash;it is fresh for them&mdash;as
we can give them of the changes that have recently taken
place among the military and political leaders of France.
They are careful to keep their opinions on these matters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
to themselves. At the most one can see that certain names
are in good odour among them.</p>

<p>It is impossible also not to speak of Rumania, whose
capital has just been taken. There is no doubt that what
is happening in Rumania is vexing to our Allies, but they
are not disturbed. My neighbour, without intending to
do so, comforts my heart by proving to me mathematically
that the misfortunes of Rumania cannot bring any happiness
into Germany. He speaks of these things with a
confidence in which sentiment has no part, but rather the
scientific knowledge of the war&mdash;if one may say so&mdash;which
is his.</p>

<p>It is from him that I glean this comforting detail&mdash;that
the Germans have organised special companies to serve
during the days on which the advances are made. Their
troops in the front lines have now so little willingness
and, indeed, power to fight, that it has been necessary
to form special companies which the enemy moves hither
and thither to meet any particularly strong attacks.</p>

<p>"Perhaps when we get to that point," said one of the
Generals near us, "we shall begin to hear them bleating
for peace."</p>

<p>"You are very certain of your men?" one of us asked
him.</p>

<p>"They are full of beans," said he.</p>

<p class="chaptitle">WAR IN THE BLACK COUNTRY.</p>


<p>Trains follow each other every quarter of an hour&mdash;endless
trains, 60 truck-loads and more, all bearing the
mark of five big French companies.</p>

<p>Some of these convoys seemed to have been borrowed
from a museum of obsolete railways. The couplings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
rattle, the buffers are out of joint, and the brakes squeak.
Others come from Belgium. One can easily see by the
repairs that they have undergone all the horrors of war.
Others, again, emblazoned with the arms of Essen or
Alsace-Lorraine, red in colour and cumbersome, are obviously
prisoners of war.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>9. THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF.</p></div>
</div>

<p>A Minister has actually dared to bring about a real
mobilisation of transport. He has ordered the seizure
of all trucks in good condition, and the captured
have gone to the front. All of them are overflowing
with every species of coal. Coal! When one thinks of
the shortage in Paris and the provinces of France, one
can appreciate the sight of these millions of tons being
rushed back from the front. Coal is the black bread
of war. At the level crossings the British regiments going
up into the line naturally give way to the greater urgency
of these supply trains.</p>

<p>We have just come back from visiting, under the
guidance of a Staff-Major, the land of shafts and mines.
Certainly, war is being waged there, but in a curious way,
as if it were added on to ordinary existence. B&mdash;&mdash;,
N&mdash;&mdash;, les M&mdash;&mdash;, V&mdash;&mdash; are so many stages in our sooty
pilgrimage!</p>

<p>In front of V&mdash;&mdash;, after having wandered in these
endless streets with houses of miners' dwellings, all exactly
alike, we come upon a huge slag heap, 800 yards high, like
some black pyramid. The neighbouring pits, with their
sheds, lifts and air-shafts, are working as usual. We pass
a party of miners, solemn and resolute-looking people, their
ages varying from 16 to 40, who are going to relieve the
workers in the galleries 200 yards below soil.</p>

<p>These civilian workers have just decided to do another
hour a day. They, too, have behaved like heroes.</p>

<p>The smoking pits are not a stone's throw from the
smoking cannons.</p>

<p>The howitzers concealed in the Black Country alternate
their "boom!" with the sharper "crack!" of trench mortars.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
A London motor-'bus, ingeniously disguised, crowded with
soldiers inside and out, is carrying a whole platoon of armed
men to the shelter of one of these slag heaps which line
the roads.</p>

<p>Here, owing to the nature of the soil, the trenches
cannot be dug down. Thousands of pumps would be
wanted to dry this sector alone.</p>

<p>The Royal Engineers have overcome the difficulty by
having recourse to the old system of breastworks. Here
redoubts, facing all ways, strong points with sloping
parapets, buttresses, bastions, half-moons, etc., are made
with sandbags&mdash;the triumph of improvisation like the
inventions of a Pacciotto or a de Vauban. But more
numerous than the Tommies are the groups of women
carrying baskets of provisions for their menfolk.</p>

<p>Under the guidance of the General Commanding the
Artillery of the Army, we visited some batteries of 9.2
howitzers, those magnificent weapons of destruction.
What ruses! What profligate conceits are used to hide
these monstrous treasures from the enemy aircraft! After
the war we must consecrate a whole chapter to those
obscure painters, designers of "take-in's," who, working
in the open country, succeed in faking the skyline and
every aspect of the earth&mdash;nay, all Nature herself.</p>

<p>A forward observing officer hidden somewhere on the
ridge, which used to be called the Hohenzollern Redoubt,
has just rung up to say that he has spotted some enemy
transport moving in the mist behind their lines. The
map reference is immediately verified and the range
ascertained. A junior subaltern blows his whistle. In a
second N.C.O.'s and men are in position. Then they
open fire, disturbing the peaceful landscape. Just beside
the battery was a beautiful pond with two swans&mdash;the
most unwarlike thing in the world. Five minutes later
we hear that the shooting was good and the transport
was scuppered.</p>

<p>In these miners' dwellings and allotments, where war<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
and humdrum life are so strangely intermingled, there
are many alarms. Aeroplane bombs, gas attacks and
hostile bombardments. When the siren starts, everyone&mdash;women,
children, old men and soldiers&mdash;go quietly
into the cellars and come up again when it is all over,
as if it was the most natural thing in the world.</p>

<p>Such is the life in the coal country. The Tommies
in the trenches, the artillery in the fields and gardens and
the workmen in the mines. Endless strife above ground,
endless labour below, each night, each day, the same.</p>

<p>France should honour these miners of Artois and
Flanders just as much as her soldiers.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_3VI" id="CHAPTER_3VI">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE ART OF SAVING.</p>


<p>Our hosts were very anxious to show us their Base at
Calais, and, the visit being over, we fully realise their reasons.
The fact is they have achieved miracles of hard
work and organisation, of which they are justly proud.</p>

<p>Dare I say that we had not taken full advantage of the
port previous to the war? It is possible that in this matter,
as in so many others, the war will have taught us useful
lessons.</p>

<p>Why should Germany have consented to make such
bloody sacrifices on the Yser if Calais had not been a prize
of great value?</p>

<p>A complete study of a base like Calais would require
days and days. We had only a few hours, and we only
saw a few things, but things of the utmost meaning, as the
reader will see.</p>

<p>Everyone knows that the wear and tear of an army
in the field is not merely concerned with losses in men.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
There is a huge combustion of materials which is almost
as important. Even when there is no actual offensive there
is considerable wastage of material, as also of men.</p>

<p>But just as the commanders of fighting units have taken
appropriate measures to spare the human animal, such as
sending troops back to rest for a certain time, so the heads
of army administration have devised means of saving every
article of "war-soiled" material. It is this organisation
that we have seen at work in Calais. Nothing could be
more instructive.</p>

<p>There exists in each British division at the front a divisional
salvage company, whose duty it is to clear up a
battlefield and collect somewhere behind the lines all damaged
equipment&mdash;rifles, uniforms, bayonets, guns, empty
cases, machine-guns, helmets, leather waistcoats, boots,
etc.</p>

<p>This poor material, dirty, rusty, even blood-stained, is
sorted out at the salvage dump and sent down to the base
by train. We saw one of these trains arrive at Calais, and
we were able to see some of the ingenious devices invented
for dealing with this curious hotch-potch. All this takes
place in an old sawmill, which has been enlarged to five
times its natural size since the beginning of the war. A
thousand skilled British workers and two thousand French
women are now employed in the workshops. Most of the
women are, in normal times, lacemakers in the town.</p>

<p>The men, skilled labourers in uniform, work by time,
not by the piece. They earn eighteenpence a day&mdash;i.e.,
6d. more than the ordinary Tommy in the trenches.</p>

<p>The women, of all ages, are used for light and not very
exhausting work, and they earn on the average 3 francs a
day (the trades-union price). What miracles take place!
In the "snob-shop," the ammunition boots, glorious
souvenirs of the front, which come back in a shocking state,
are examined and repaired. Twenty thousand pairs a
week. The hopeless pairs are made into laces. One
woman can make 150 per day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>At the saddlery, harness and leather, covered with mud
and blood, are cleaned as good as new. At the forge,
wheels and couplings of gun-carriages are repaired. Elsewhere
the essential parts of the guns are examined and
all missing sections replaced.</p>

<p>In another place the dixies and camp-cookers, all dented
and rusty, are cleaned and re-soldered. Old petrol tins
are made into trench braziers. Steel helmets recover their
form, picks and shovels their handles, and all the iron that
cannot be made use of is sent back to the foundry to be
melted down for ammunition.</p>

<p>Over the door of this war factory might be inscribed
the motto of Lavoisier, with a slight addition:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Here nothing new is made, but nothing old is wasted."</p></blockquote>

<p>The science that is taught and practised is the science,
hitherto too little known, of economy.</p>

<p>That is the reason why many men of the world (and
others) should, like us, visit this base.</p>

<p class="chaptitle">"BROTHERS IN ARMS."</p>


<p><i>The Times</i>, through the medium of its distinguished
representative with the British Army, Mr. Robinson, has
recently published a very laudatory and somewhat flattering
article on the attitude of the French soldier and the
civil population of France towards the British Expeditionary
Force.</p>

<p>"It must not be forgotten," said the great journal of
the metropolis, "that we are foreigners in France. Thus
the spectacle of good-comradeship which we witness every
day is altogether honourable to our French hosts."</p>

<p>We must be allowed to say in our turn that never before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
has it been so easy to practise the military virtue of comradeship,
for my countrymen are fully alive to the tact
and perfect courtesy of the officers and men of King George.</p>

<p>There is nothing to add to what has been known from
the beginning about the relations of the soldiers of both
countries. Even before the military prowess of Great
Britain had been proved on the field of battle, her collaboration
in this war was desired by our soldiers and civilians
alike. We will always remember with emotion the fateful
days of 2nd and 4th August&mdash;when we asked ourselves,
"Will England fight with us?" Then, when that foolish
Emperor of Germany talked of General French's "contemptible
little Army," we had in France the presentiment
that the British Army would be able to take its revenge.</p>

<p>Recent events have confirmed the early promise of fine
achievements; the battle of the Marne, the two battles of
Ypres, Neuve Chapelle, Loos, the Somme, and the Ancre
have sealed the friendship of the two armies.</p>

<p>Equally courageous and loyal, sharing the same ideas
about the original aims of the war, enduring the same hardships,
patiently bearing common misfortunes, and jubilant
alike over common victory, the Tommy and the "Poilu"
have become "chums" that will be difficult to separate.</p>

<p>Two sorts of "<i>agents de liaison</i>" have helped in the
good work&mdash;these are the French interpreters and the Staff
officers of the French Mission to the British Army.</p>

<p>The former, a goodly number, well chosen, well-bred,
and well educated, have been, each in his own unit, sowers
of the good seed of Franco-British friendship.</p>

<p>The latter, a very small number (the result of careful
sifting), having a consummate experience of war, most of
them possessing honourable wounds, highly educated, some
writers of reputation, known all over the world&mdash;such as
the author of "<i>Quand on se bat</i>"&mdash;deserve our utmost thanks
for their work with our Allies which they have carried out
so brilliantly.</p>

<p>The question of the relations of the British Army with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
the civil population is delicate in appearance only. As a
matter of fact, a mutual goodwill from the very start has
removed all suspicion of awkwardness and strain.</p>

<p>The danger was obvious. In the records of history it
is impossible to find a case of a country tolerating without
a murmur the presence of a foreign army, even an allied
army. This miracle has been rendered possible by the
goodwill of the French, fully understood and recognised
by our friends, and by the tact and common sense of the
British.</p>

<p>Far from assuming an attitude of conquerors, which
would most certainly have estranged the sympathies of the
patriotic inhabitants of North-West France, the British
have rigorously respected our manners and customs.</p>

<p>Our administrative organisation has been maintained.
We have still our prefects and sub-prefects, our tribunals,
justices of the peace, savings banks, postal services and
schools, living in absolute independence in the midst of the
British war machine.</p>

<p>Better still, our own military organisation still exists.
In every part of our country occupied by the British our
Army has its representatives, such as workers on the roads,
Army Service Corps units, and military police.</p>

<p>All this crowd, civilians and soldiers alike, "carry on"
without the smallest hitch or quarrel with our British guests.
This occupation of our territory, carried out with so much
understanding and discipline, could not possibly cause any
discontent among our peasants.</p>

<p>Over and above the protection of a rich district, the
British Army has developed commercially a great number
of ports and inland towns, has created industries hitherto
unknown, increased the railways, put to the utmost use the
resources of the country, and, in fact, has improved local
commerce in every respect.</p>

<p>Those who listen to the vile insinuations of the Germans
and impute to the British the desire of remaining in France<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
after the war, little understand the love of every British
citizen for his native soil and his respect for our own independence.</p>

<p>In order to divide our two friendly nations the Germans
must find another trick. Some money, great sympathy,
and, alas! many dead, are all that will be left of our
friends in France after the war.<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a></p>

<p class="chaptitle">AS IN A PICTURE OF EPINAL.</p>


<p>Yesterday I met the Prince of Wales in the lines. The
Prince of Wales! What does that name not say to a
Frenchman!</p>

<p>It was about four o'clock in the afternoon. A small,
soaking rain was falling over the dismal plateau where
once stood so many smiling villages and fair woods, now
ruined, whose names, immortalised by British valour, must
live forever in history.</p>

<p>It was close on nightfall. Through the sticky, heavy
mud troops and wagons crawled towards the firing line.
The men, with naked chests that defied the bitter cold,
sweated furiously under the load of their equipment.
Horses with huge, hairy feet, mounted by Australians like
so many cowboys, struggled, foaming, to drag the huge
lorries through the deep ruts of the roadway.</p>

<p>Men from the pioneer battalions, directed by Engineers,
worked with pick and shovel to drain away the water, to
rebuild the fallen embankments, or to fill up boggy places.
So while the guns roared, methodically and in silence the
Army prepared the soil for Victory.</p>

<p>Suddenly, into this microcosm of the war, came a body
of horsemen, climbing towards us up the slopes of the
plateau. At their head rode a lad whose features were so
refined and so delicate that I could not choose but remark
him.</p>

<p>I have already met in the British battle lines several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
faces of this kind. They are almost feminine. They are
like miniatures.</p>

<p>My eyes&mdash;may I be forgiven&mdash;dwelt upon this boy with
a complete lack of respect. He looked between 18 and 20
years old at the most. He had cocked his cap a trifle over
his left eye, and his fair head was cropped close as rabbit's
fur.</p>

<p>"Did you recognise him?" someone asked me.</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"The Prince of Wales."</p>

<p>The Prince of Wales had gone by.</p>

<p>It was only then that I noticed the British soldiers
standing to attention and saluting the Prince with "eyes
right" as he went along amongst them. The officers, too,
saluted him with more ceremony than is usual. And he,
as he rode slowly past, very charmingly acknowledged the
salutes.</p>

<p>I have learned only this morning that a little farther on,
at the highest part of the plateau, the Prince left his horse
and&mdash;this is a thing that he is very fond of doing&mdash;joined
a relieving party for a piece of its journey. He returned
in the evening to the simple quarters which are his.</p>

<p>A Staff Captain at twenty-three, the Prince, heir to the
Crown of the British Empire, is a pattern of the best
soldierly qualities. He can only live happily among the
soldiers, with whom he is prodigiously popular.</p>

<p>It is said that he would have liked to do still more.</p>

<p>One day he asked permission of Lord Kitchener, who
was then Secretary of State for War, to perform the ordinary
duties of an officer with his regiment, the Grenadier
Guards. He proposed to lead his men in an advance.</p>

<p>But Kitchener refused absolutely, and we can imagine
the valiant argument which ensued between Prince and
Sirdar&mdash;the one all youth and pluck, the other concerned
alone with the welfare of the Empire.</p>

<p>The Prince ultimately was obliged to yield to reasons of
State. It was a soldier's first victory&mdash;over himself.</p>

<p class="chaptitle">A HERO AFTER THE MANNER OF ROLAND.</p>


<p class="rightheader">
December.<br />
</p>

<p>General Vaughan Campbell, Brigadier of the &mdash;th
Infantry Brigade, having done us the honour to pay us
a visit, invited us, for this Thursday, to share his meal.</p>

<p>The General has made his winter quarters in a country
house, beside which there is a duck-pond. An English
breakfast awaited us; that is to say, a hearty welcome,
no ceremony, and food of the best.</p>

<p>Outside in the park, under the trees that the hoar-frost
loads, the brigade band favours us with the liveliest
melodies from <i>Bric-à-brac</i>, <i>The Girl in the Taxi</i> and,
above all, those <i>Bing Boys</i>, who seem fated to eclipse
<i>Tipperary</i> itself in the general favour. It is three degrees
below freezing-point. All round the band they have had
to set a circle of braziers. I am on the General's left,
a particular distinction which I purchase at the cost of
sitting with my back against an open window, where I
become the sport of a whole battlefield of draughts. But
it is a cheap price for the company of General Vaughan
Campbell.</p>

<p>This is one of the most popular men in the British
Army. He must surely be the youngest of its Generals,
for he is not yet 38. This very month King George has
still further swelled the number of his orders by giving
him the Victoria Cross. Only 250 men in the whole Army
can boast of this honour.</p>

<p>The man's quality is evident. He is strength and
good nature personified. With his rider's legs, his broad,
short body, muscular yet supple, he is the picture of a
sporting Englishman. The merry eye betrays the simple
heart. The wind and the open-air life have tanned his face
like a seaman's. He wears, moreover, an odd little cat's
moustache, two red, bristling tufts, which makes one think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
of the traditional musketeers of Louis XIV. A little time
ago I saw him run in a two-mile race against some of his
younger Staff Officers.</p>

<p>This General is a hero; a hero in that great style
which glorifies every gallant action with the touch of
chivalry. One evening in the trenches he performed a
feat worthy of Roland.</p>

<p>The story is well known. In September last General
Vaughan Campbell was a Colonel in the Guards. His
regiment held the first line, immediately next to the
Germans.</p>

<p>One evening the order came to attack at midnight.
It fell to the Coldstreams to undertake this dangerous
business. It was a sweet and tranquil autumn night.
The men fought with sleep, harder to resist than any
pain. But the hour for the attack had come.</p>

<p>This Colonel has a knightly soul. He perceives that
his men, far from their home, living for ever in holes,
and mud and fog, sometimes lose their vision of the true
meaning of this war. It is their souls that must be stirred.
And the Colonel, who used to be the keenest Master of Fox
Hounds in Shropshire, recollected that he had among his
things a hunting-horn whose call was clearer than any
cornet's.</p>

<p>He got his men together, gave them the word to "go
over," and then, jumping on to the parapet, blew "gone
away" with the full strength of his lungs. As if in this
fierce summons they heard the very voice of their own
country, the Coldstreams, wild with delight, charged
madly on the heels of this new Roland. The call of the
horn sounded weirdly through the night above "No
Man's Land." It is to these men like the bagpipes to
the Highlander; a voice from the Homeland and the
call of the Empire.</p>

<p>Colonel Campbell is the first man in the enemy's
trench. His cat's moustache has become a tiger's. Even
with his horn he lays about him. With it he stuns the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
first Saxon he meets, to whose dazed eyes he seems like
some spectre from another age. And two lines of trenches
are taken.</p>

CAMPBELL'S HEROIC ACT.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Reproduced by special permission of the proprietors of "Punch."</i></p>

<p>All England has heard the tale. The Guards, whom
the Colonel left but yesterday to become a General, have
presented him with a silver hunting-horn, inscribed, in
commemoration of his deed, with an account of it and
this glorious motto: "Nulli Secundus." The King has
rewarded his magnificent exploit with the rank of
General. And the Empire has awarded him unhesitatingly
that for which the bravest soldiers of this brave
race rejoice to die&mdash;the Cross that bears the words "For
Valour."</p>

<p>A little time after the splendid action which I have
recorded a young girl, whose name is not known, sent
the following letter to General Campbell. This touching
message alone would be enough to illustrate this Book of
the Friendship of France and Britain.</p>

<p class="rightheader">
"<span style="margin-right: 2.5em;">Paris,</span><br />
"8th December, 1916.<br />
</p>

<p>"I send you the thanks of a French girl for the gallant
deed&mdash;the deed <i>à la française</i>&mdash;which you have performed.
We do not know one another, perhaps we never
shall, but in the sky there is many a meeting between
the stars. Why should not souls on earth come sometimes,
then, together?</p>

<p>"General&mdash;Paladin, should I not say?&mdash;I knew your
country very little. I thought that the Divine Pity and
the Greatest Beauty were unknown to you; that through
your fogs the light could never find its way. And then
you put your hunting horn to your lips; you were inspired
so beautifully to go to your encounter with Death, your
head held high, the music of your homeland sounding
your advance.</p>

<p>"My ancestor fought at Fontenoy, and I can appreciate
the refinements of chivalry. And so I beg you to
receive my apologies. You have conquered much more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
than a horde out of Saxony. You have disclosed to
France the fabric of your soul, and you know that my
country values above all the courage that can laugh and
the dazzling chivalry that meets Death, as we say, in
white gloves.</p>

<p>"And if, now and then, you are ever sad, think, I pray
you, of the fair little twenty-year-old French girl whose
ignorance you have enlightened, whom you have shown
how to judge England. And if you have no love of
your own, no woman's tender care to warm your heart
with its genial kindliness, permit me to embrace you with
all my soul. And smile, sometimes, to think that the
daughter of an officer of France, the Land of Chivalry,
is thinking of you.</p>

<p>"'A Happy Christmas. A Glad New Year.' I wish
you a great victory and a great love."</p>

<p>"Copy of a letter sent to General John Vaughan
Campbell by favour of Monsieur Tudesq. Will you
have the very great kindness to bring this expression of
my admiration to the General? Accept also my congratulations
upon your truly heart-stirring narrative.</p>

<p>"So you knew those people that have just gone by in
the carriage, Lovel."</p>

<p>"How should I know them?"</p>

<p>"Then why did you let them past you?"</p>

<p>"It's true, I wasn't strict enough. But they roared out
such a G.H.Q.<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> at me that I didn't dare to stop them."</p>

<p>"Wave your lantern, Lovel. Here's another carriage."</p>

<p>So chatted, during this night of 7th November, on the
road to Bapaume, two of His Majesty's Tommies. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
were two scrubby little Scotsmen. Each wore his tam-o'-shanter
falling over one eye.</p>

<p>The night was almost beautiful; the sky covered with
fleecy clouds, among which, like a great liquid eye, the
moon showed herself now and then. We were going to
spend the night in the English lines.</p>

<p>Very few sounds are to be heard. The farmers' dogs
have long abandoned this unpeaceful country, and the crowing
of the cocks, those earliest victims of every war, has even
longer been stilled.</p>

<p>Silence reigns.</p>

<p>How is it, then, that this silence seems menacing? It
only seems so. Stop a moment and listen. Do you not
now hear in the darkness a host of little sounds? An
invisible world is moving about us. Listen!</p>

<p>Yes, there is the sound of many feet on the road&mdash;not
the brisk tramp of the parade ground, but the steps of the
poor souls who are fighting their way through the mud.
It is as if ten thousand little wings were flapping.</p>

<p>All lights are out. The long stream of motor-cars moves
upon the road in perfect order. Midnight. Now the preparations
for the advance are at their height. Now is the
time when the reliefs come up, the blessed hour, so long expected
by those who quit the trenches, by those who go
into them so bravely met.</p>

<p>In their English helmets, which look like basins upside-down,
caked with mud&mdash;already&mdash;to the eyes, with their
rifles shouldered, slung, or carried in the hand, but each
one carefully protected by its canvas cover, smoking their
pipes, their chests thrown forward against the weight of
their bursting haversacks, steady of step and bright of eye,
the Tommies go forward to relieve their friends.</p>

<p>When they feel the need of a rest the men in khaki,
quite regardless of the mud, throw themselves down on
the sopping earth, and man, clothing, and soil become one.
In this country of the dead you may hardly distinguish
shadows from the objects which throw them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>Every now and then a despatch rider passes us&mdash;day
and night, it is all one to these links in the chain of communication&mdash;a
motor-cyclist, crouched over his handle-bar,
hands and nose frozen, eyes red, his nerves on edge, skirting
the side of the road, and sometimes remaining there, stuck.
Or perhaps it is a horseman, leading his exhausted beast
by its bridle, but determined, though he kill his horse, to
get his work done before morning.</p>

<p>But now the horizon, black hitherto, lights up with
flashes that seem to be lightning. These are followed by
dull thuds. The British artillery has chosen this moment
before the dawn to reawaken the Boche to the realisation
of his own abominable existence.</p>

<p>Shall we climb this tree for a better view? Up there
we shall see marvellously. We grope our way upwards.
The wind, which has risen and now blows strongly, rocks
the great tree and us with it in the darkness. It is delightful.
Think of all the brave fellows who climb up here at
all times of the day and night, to sit for hours in constant
peril of their lives! A stimulating thought!</p>

<p>And what a fine seat for the fireworks! One doesn't
miss a thing. See that blue light! And the red fire on
the right! What's that glow&mdash;look!&mdash;over there?</p>

<p>"An eighteen-inch," says somebody. He means that
they have just fired one of the great eighteen-inch guns.
It is, of course, an English gun.</p>

<p>We continue our journey through the night, coming
ever nearer to the firing line. Our guide knows every
smallest path of this section like the palm of his hand&mdash;better,
indeed, than his own London streets.</p>

<p>Here, lately, he got his first wound. There&mdash;where
that anti-aircraft gun is lurking&mdash;he saw his best friend fall.
And this place is not safe even yet. All round us the guns,
great and small, sing their chorus to the night. Was not
that short thud, a moment ago, a 75? Odd, how things
get mixed up nowadays! A 75 with the English! Hullo,
there! Can you tell us what that was just now?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>And now we are amazed to see an immense light which,
how I cannot tell, has suddenly flooded the whole sky with
a red glare. Our guide, who has passed months on end
in the trenches, tells us that he has never before seen this
appearance. It seems like an <i>Aurora borealis</i>, pierced to
the zenith by a perpendicular ray, like an L, of a still fiercer
red. And now upon this weirdly-lit background rise thick
spirals of vapour. And the picture is miles long. Mysterious,
deadly beauty, that the bursting of the shrapnel
seems to applaud!</p>

<p>There is no mystery. A squadron of German war
planes has crossed the first lines in the darkness and dropped
incendiary bombs where it has supposed a store of
munitions to be. The perpendicular beam&mdash;a stripe upon
that red cloth&mdash;is the ray of a searchlight, probing the dark
sky. This <i>Aurora borealis</i>&mdash;this Northern Dawn&mdash;is the
work of man, and will soon be put to flight by the dawn of
the coming day.</p>

<p>"And what's that, Major?" one of us asks, pointing to
a star.</p>

<p>"One of the good God's aeroplanes," says the Englishman.</p>

</p>

<p>A nobleman, with blue eyes and the haughty carriage
that tells of ancient blood, presented us to that diabolical
young creature who is making such a stir in the world
to-day, and will make a good deal more before she is
done: Mademoiselle Crème de Menthe. Observe the
"de." She is a noble of the 1916 creation. Nothing less
than a Peer and a Staff Officer might fittingly act as
Master of Ceremonies to a young person of such quality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>We made our bow with a civility which bordered upon
that terror which nightmare alone can inspire. Consider
how it would be, some mild, foggy morning, to come
plump upon a Diplodocus. The scene of this presentation
was an old mansion, with courtyard and park, whose
gates were made illustrious by the arms of the La Rochefoucaulds.</p>

<p>This was our first experience as war correspondents
with the British Army.</p>

<p>Our account of to-day's adventures will be no less
fantastic.</p>

<p>Programme: A Journey to the Land of Mines.</p>

<p>We have had rain. Moving in opposite directions,
the two streams of the traffic plough up the road. Commissariat
lorries, motor ambulances, artillery ammunition
wagons, despatch riders, the motor-cars of the Staff,
and then, in the middle of this mad torrent of traffic, some
country gig, creeping along at a jog-trot. The roads are
a river of mud. We wallow in it frantically; we drown in
unsuspected lakes. We suffer the modern equivalent of the
punishment of Sodom and Gomorrah. At once we find
ourselves being changed into clumsy statues of clay. It
is not more cars that are needed to get forward, but those
Venetian boats that glide along the canals before the
strokes of a curved oar.</p>

<p>One does get on, however. And here we are at Albert
already.</p>

<p>Ah! these little towns of Picardy! The German
shells have no surprises left for them. Their houses
gutted from roof to cellar, their churches that the guns
have chiselled to new shapes, their farms that have neither
roof nor wall, and seem, with their bare beams, like
huge empty cages&mdash;these sorrows no longer count. Yesterday
Albert was once again bombarded. What of it?
The fronts of a few more houses have crumbled into
dust. The great golden Virgin, who, 100 feet in the
air, leans with crossed arms from her belfry over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
ruined town, has fallen forwards at a rather dizzier
angle!</p>

<p>As in London or Paris, the police direct the traffic
at the cross-ways and the corners of the lanes. The streets
have been re-christened of late. One reads: "Oxford
Street," "Cannon Street." We are here in the heart of the
war zone. And in this strange country our little old
French towns rub their eyes in wonder to find themselves,
heretofore so insignificant, now in the very moment of
their utter destruction, wakened to share the dignity of
<i>capitals</i>.</p>

<p>Still more miles of mud. We leave the road and,
with the heavy gait of sewer-men, move through the
fields.</p>

<p>Far ahead, on the winding ridges, we see great white
marks, like the letter "Y." They are the German trenches,
dug in the solid chalk at the beginning of the offensive.
It is as if someone had made chalk drawings on those
slopes to amuse the aeroplanes. In front, following their
lines, are walls of sand-bags, so high and so deep that
they appear to be a citadel: the English trenches. It
is a stiff climb. We hop from puddle to puddle like
sparrows. Everywhere the earth is in heaps. Holes
filled with water&mdash;shell-holes, you understand&mdash;have
turned the whole place into a chessboard of sunken
squares. Here, there and everywhere, sole lords of this
"No Man's Land," stand the shells of the two-hundred-and-tens
or the two-hundred-and-forties, like terminal
gods, red painted. But the real surprise still awaits us.</p>

<p>Here may I ask you to recall to your most particular
remembrance the landscapes of the Moon as Wells and
Jules Verne have pictured them for us. Or if chance has
offered you the privilege of leaning over the lip of Etna
or Vesuvius, summon now your best recollections of the
experience. We are on the threshold of a chaos for
whose description the tongue of man is poorly equipped.</p>

<p>A plateau, according to the geographers, is a dome,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
flattened or rounded, in the direction of Heaven; these
plateaux, as war constructs them, are gulfs that lead
down towards hell. Over hundreds of yards between
the opposing trenches surges a sea of vast funnels. One
stands amazed before them as before those abysses which
open at one's feet among the Alps. Here the destructive
genius of man has nothing to learn from the dreadful
wrath of Nature.</p>

<p>It is raining. Bogs, where the grass is already
sprouting between the yellow pools, lie in the low places,
like those cold lakes that fill the tall craters of Auvergne.
Here yawns an opening, propped with beams, and three-quarters
covered with the continually sliding earth. A
sap. There again stands a notice, posted too late:
"Poison!&mdash;Danger!"</p>

<p>Wreckage of every kind&mdash;rusty tins, heaps of cases
bursting with rotten bags of powder and saltpetre, litter
these strange craters. And what an amazing efflorescence
of old iron, grenades and bits of shell!</p>

<p>In this Land of Mines we find a symbol of the savage
splendour of this war. All these carefully prepared
horrors, all these apocalyptic monstrosities, for the conquest
of an acre or two! One can understand why King
George came here, as a wooden tablet records, to the
edge of this fabulous, petrified tide race, to salute the
victorious courage of the Empire's soldiers.</p>

<p>Beast-like around us roar the guns. Lightnings
flicker through the haze. A line of skeleton trees jags
the horizon&mdash;Delville Wood. To the West vague clouds
of smoke from camp fires, vague heaps of bricks. This
is all that we can call Mametz and Montauban. A
sausage balloon rises jerkily&mdash;over there, towards
Maricourt. One cannot speak these names with a steady
voice. They are the foretaste of Freedom. And it is
here, in the Land of Mines, that the foundations of Victory
have been laid.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_4V" id="CHAPTER_4V">CHAPTER V.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE MENACE OF THE GOLDEN VIRGIN.</p>


<p>I have now to tell of the reconquered ground, and I own
that the description, which I cannot claim to have invented,
more nearly than any other suggests the reality. Indeed,
there are not in the French language, nor can there be in
any other, for the imagination cannot conceive such things,
any words that can give a just idea of so much wretchedness
and desolation.</p>

<p>So I have thought a score of times, while, during these
last days, I have been making my way over the plateau
which lies between the Ancre and the Somme, a quite
narrow section of the battle front. What would be my
difficulty had I to describe the land that the French
have retaken!</p>

<p>We had set out on our pilgrimage from Albert.</p>

<p>"Albert! That's an old story&mdash;ancient history. Tell
us about something else," say those who look for new
sensations.</p>

<p>Not so. We may not yet forget Albert, that ruined
outpost of Picardy, for her sufferings are not ended.
Within the last few days the Boches bombarded her from
an immense distance. They only succeeded in knocking
over ruins, since all is ruin at Albert, but "if one can't
get thrushes one eats blackbirds," eh, friend Fritz?</p>

<p>"Well, Mother So-and-So," said an old fellow to an
old dame the other morning in a street in Amiens, "when
do you think the folks will get back into Albert?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, Father Such-and-Such, you know that as
well as I do. When the Golden Virgin falls."</p>

<p>For a superstition runs in this country that the war
will be near its end when the Golden Virgin, who hangs
suspended&mdash;by what miracle?&mdash;between Heaven and
Earth, from the top of the belfry of Albert, shall fall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
to break in pieces upon the ground. But the trouble is
that the Virgin "holds on."</p>

<p>From Albert to Fricourt, going via Bécordel-Bécourt,
the road is hardly 1-1/2 miles long. By this way one skirts
in an almost straight line the South-western slopes of the
plateau. A few steps beyond the German line that was
taken on the 1st July, and we are in Fricourt.</p>

<p>You will look a long time in the guide-books that were
held in esteem before the war ere you will find the smallest
mention of Fricourt. Fricourt, Mametz, Montauban, Contalmaison
and a dozen other villages that now can never
be forgotten, did not exist for the tourist. He got on most
happily without them.</p>

<p>Well, to-day all these villages can be found on their
own soil no more than in those guide-books. That,
Fricourt! This grey blotch in front of the wood of the
same name! That, the Public Square, that rectangle of
tree-trunks!</p>

<p>That? Yes, that is very surely Fricourt. All the
villages are like that.</p>

<p>Let us get on and you shall see for yourself. A short
climb, but a stiff one, and we are in Mametz.</p>

<p>You look about you and you see nothing at all. Believe
me, I am not joking. The number of mounds and
wooden crosses of every size that border the edges of
the road tell us plainly enough at what a cost to both
sides these ruined hamlets were captured.</p>

<p>Another fight with the mud and we are in Montauban
de Picardie. Montauban looks over all this plateau
that lies between the Ancre and the Somme. In clear
weather one can see everywhere around, and towards the
North-west the houses of Bapaume are visible. To-day
the clouds are too low and the rain too heavy for us to
try to see anything at all.</p>

<p>One can, moreover, look at nothing but the earth, for
it is here that the story of recent events is most clearly
to be read.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>The first thing that one finds on entering Montauban
is the little cemetery on the left. To enter the village it
was necessary first to cross this cemetery; and to cross
it, they had to "make jam" of it. Will you be so good
as to consider what a cemetery is like when it has been
made into jam? Grave-stones torn up and smashed,
crosses thrown down, Christs crucified again, iron railings
twisted grotesquely, vaults burst open, corpses.... Out
of such a chaos, who shall ever retrieve the dear
graves of his dead?</p>

<p>And see these gaping holes where once were houses,
these cellars laid bare, the bellows of the blacksmith,
bits of the trough where baker Moulin kneaded his bread,
splintered pieces of the chemist's bottles, the whole stock
of the draper's at the corner&mdash;ribbons, thread and remnants&mdash;a
fragment from the porch of the town hall, and
on it the word "<i>Égalité</i>."</p>

<p>Equality in suffering, one would say.</p>

<p>But perhaps we may find some sign of peace beyond
the village in the little wood of Bernafay, which in other
days offered a calm retreat to the weary and a shelter
to lovers.</p>

<p>No! The wood of Bernafay is a wood no longer, and
so it is with all the pretty woods of this neighbourhood,
Trônes, Belville and Foureaux. How is one to describe
this ghastly picture of roots, clayey soil freshly ploughed
up, shattered trunks of every size, and dismal stumps,
among which, none the less, the birds persist in their
vain search for food and cover?</p>

<p>These trees will bud again; Nature will clothe herself
once more in green; even the earth that lies about us
will yield new fruits. But the villages? What magical
power shall call them back to life, unless it be the marvellous
vitality of France&mdash;France, who refuses to die?</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_4VI" id="CHAPTER_4VI">CHAPTER VI</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">"RONNY."</p>


<p>This is not a Christmas story.</p>

<p>His real name was P&mdash;&mdash;, but his name must not be
mentioned on account of the family who mourns for him
in a corner of the County of Surrey. We will simply call
him "Ronny," as his school friends, and, later on, his
brothers-in-arms, used to call him.</p>

<p>"Ronny" was barely eighteen years old when war
broke out. He was full of spirit, and already had a knowledge
of soldiering, so he volunteered immediately, and
soon got his commission.</p>

<p>His appearance was incredibly young. Fine features.
A well-bred nose and a child's eyes. When he first appeared
in mess he was bombarded with amiable chaff, all
of which he took in good part and replied with witty retaliation.
He could exchange a joke without malice, like
the good sportsman that he was.</p>

<p>Above all, "Ronny" was fond of his job. He threw his
whole soul into the work of glory, which he accomplished
with ease and grace, for he had rare gifts of leadership.
You should have seen him on the barrack square with his
men, this wisp of a boy. "Company, properly at ease
everywhere." The moment he spoke, discipline and obedience
reigned. The fact is, "Ronny" was "some" boy.</p>

<p>His Colonel thought him too good a soldier to leave
behind when the battalion was ordered abroad, even though
he loved him as his son. Then followed two long, weary
years of fighting, which only served to draw these two
(master and pupil) closer together.</p>

<p>On 3rd September, 1916, during the Somme offensive,
the battalion was in action on the Ancre, and did gloriously.
The day was won, but at roll-call there was no "Ronny."
At first he was said to be dead, then wounded, but no trace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
of him could be found, either among the dead or in the
hospitals. So Captain P&mdash;&mdash;, 20 years old, appeared in the
official lists as "Missing."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i16large.jpg"><img src="images/i16.jpg" width="400" height="291" alt="" /></a>
<div class="caption"><p>14. "MULTIS ILLE BONIS FLEBILIS OCCIDIT."</p></div>
</div>

<p>One day the Colonel received a letter from "Ronny's"
parents. They had seen his name in the lists. "What
does this mean? They said 'Missing.' Can we still
hope?"</p>

<p>Between men of the same county and lineage, whose
heart and blood have but one pulse, there is no need to
dissemble. "Your son was as my own," said the Colonel.
"Our sorrow is the same."</p>

<p>So they mourned for "Ronny."</p>

<p>On 19th November two men, the Colonel and myself,
visited, with heavy hearts, the field of the Ancre (a further
edition of the same fight), still teeming with the heat of
battle. The dead lay scattered around, some horribly
mutilated, some struck down in the very act of fighting,
with gestures of defiance to the enemy and their weapons&mdash;even
to Heaven itself. Alas, for the vanity of all human
ambitions!</p>

<p>As for me&mdash;you remember, dear Colonel&mdash;I was distraught
and beside myself, and could only murmur, "Poor
devils! Poor devils!" You were calmer, more familiar (is
it possible?) with these horrors. Yet your sad eyes were
a proof to me that even soldiers do feel.</p>

<p>I remember, as we turned to leave the field of death
and honour, you looked back, and I noticed that just in
front of you, right in your path, was a human head, already
fleshless&mdash;a skull.</p>

<p>I seized you by the arm. "Stop!" I cried. Too late!
Your heavy boots&mdash;&mdash; The thing crushed like a broken
egg-shell. I heard you say, "God, if it were him!"
"Who? What? Him?" I said. You didn't answer. You
were on your knees. The decaying cloth of the collar
yielded to your searching hands. The disc? Yes, there
it was! ... I hear you now! I shall never forget your
cry: "Ronny, my Ronny!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_4VII" id="CHAPTER_4VII">CHAPTER VII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">PIPING OUT THE DAY.</p>


<p class="rightheader">
14th November.<br />
</p>

<p>It is just before sunset&mdash;the most impressive moment
of the day in these British lines. Now, wherever the British
soldiers meet their bands, the following picture may be
seen.</p>

<p>We were returning from the trenches, a few evenings
ago, at about four o'clock. The sky was cloudy; the
ground heavy. As the night fell, a cold, penetrating fog
enveloped the whole countryside. We were walking
thoughtfully along, our minds busy with those impressions
of the war which had greeted us, without pause, since morning.
We said little, for we were very ready for our beds.</p>

<p>Suddenly, as we were entering the village, the sound of
music reached our ears. It was the bagpipes. Music in
this poor village, at this time of day, and in such weather!
Here's a bit of luck! Hurry up, there! We hurry up;
nay, we run. At last we reach the scene of action, where
a most pleasant sight awaits us.</p>

<p>In front is the principal street of the village, with its
double row of whitewashed houses. At the distance of a
few hundred yards the fog swallows it up. That is the
town hall, hardly bigger than the biggest of the houses,
there where you see the <i>Journal Officiel</i> posted, and Abel
Faivre's picture, "<i>On les aura!</i>"</p>

<p>The band is halted in the very middle of the road, facing
the East. In front, twelve pipers; behind, eight
bugles and side drums; between them, the big drum.
The men wore the kilt flapping above their bare knees, the
khaki tunic closely belted at the waist, the plaid on their
shoulders, and the plumed tam-o'-shanter. They are
magnificent men, with deeply-bronzed faces; and they are
as grave as sphinxes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p>At a word from the bandmaster the four bugles leave
the ranks, and two by two, with measured steps, fall in at
the head of the procession. Slowly and in perfect time
they put their instruments to their lips and sound a retreat,
or something of the kind. The air is very much the same
as the "lights out" of our own infantry regiments. The
bugles having gone back to their places with a repetition
of their ceremonial, it is the pipers' turn. The twelve
Scotsmen blow like one. What are they playing?</p>

<p>The unaccustomed ear of a Frenchman is puzzled to
put a name to such music. Is it a dance? Is it a lament?</p>

<p>The song of the pipes swells out louder, and now the
bugles and drums are to give it their support. But before
touching their drums, the drummers, with the derision of
automata, bring their heels together, throw out their chests,
and then, raising their elbows face high, cross the drumsticks
behind their necks.</p>

<p>Only then may they begin to play.</p>

<p>The Scotsman who handles the big drum hits it first on
one side and then on the other, and each time whirls his
free drumstick like a windmill. He is not perhaps a musical
virtuoso, but there can be no question about his ability as
a juggler.</p>

<p>And now the bandsmen, who have stood, hitherto,
motionless in the middle of the village, bestir themselves,
and, marking time to their own music, move forwards with
a slow and majestic step.</p>

<p>The sadness of the music, the gravity of the Scotsmen,
the falling night, the homeliness of the place, and a certain
indefinable flavour as of some pagan rite, stir one's heart
strangely.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the village street has become filled with
soldiers.</p>

<p>Various detachments, just back from their work, fall in
along the sides of the roadway. The men, with their steel
helmets and leather coats, their breasts exposed to the
wind, look like the legionaries of Rome. Nothing is lacking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
to this picture but the incense and the altar and the
victims.</p>

<p>The short, sharp words of command and the clink of
weapons mingle with the wailing of the pipes, while at their
cottage doors the lonely wives of French soldiers look on
calmly at all this bustle in their street. A little fair-headed
girl beats time to the music with her left hand.</p>

<p>The night has been saluted by the armies of Britain.</p>

<p>The night may now come.</p>


<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_4VIII" id="CHAPTER_4VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">Y GULLY.</p>


<p>Between Beaumont-Hamel and Beaucourt, near the
bend which the Ancre makes where it turns to meet the
Somme, there is a deep gully, about three hundred yards
across, which the Tommies have christened&mdash;probably
they were a trifle short of words that day&mdash;with the last
letter but one of the alphabet. It is called Y Gully.</p>

<p>Up to the very last fight on the Ancre the German lines
ran in front of this gully, to the West. The enemy made
use of this most valuable hollow to conceal there his reserves
of men and ammunition. Its western cliffs could
easily afford cover to a full brigade of infantry&mdash;and, indeed,
they did so. At the bottom of the ravine runs a railway, in
peace time of the ordinary gauge. The Germans, however,
had found occasion to substitute for it a Décauville, and this
was used, under the protection of the little valley, by the
three German lines which defended the summit against
the British troops. The position seemed to be one of
tremendous strength.</p>

<p>One could almost detest Nature, so often and so terribly
does she seem to make herself the confederate of our most
formidable enemies. But mankind, in the person of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
British Allies, has revenged itself upon her for this undesirable
amiability, and out of a pretty winding valley, over
whose blossoming soil the feet of lovers were wont to
stray, has created this blasted gorge, this Gorge of Death,
this Valley of Jehoshaphat, where one expects at every
turn to meet with some mourning Jeremiah.</p>

<p>The Tommies who have opened the road for us to this
abode of misery had to overcome the greatest difficulties.
I have already described this battlefield at the very moment
of the offensive, while it was still covered by its dead. I
could not find, on this my second visit, a trace of those poor
bodies which the grave-diggers had just finished hiding out
of sight. The Tommies who fell in this fight were collected
into vast common graves, which kindly hands have marked
out with frames of pebbles. As for the German bodies,
they were buried in their own trenches&mdash;to fill them up
was all that was necessary&mdash;or in the shell craters where the
machine-gun had dropped them. And so in this ravine
Death is on every side, and the ground has, in many places,
taken the shapes of the bodies that lie beneath it.</p>

<p>The eyes of all the "poilus"&mdash;the real ones, the men of
Douaumont, and Vaux, and the ravine of La Caillette, and
many another of these lunar landscapes&mdash;have rested upon
similar scenes, which remind one a little of those undistinguished
districts in the suburbs of Paris where the dustmen
come to shoot their rubbish.</p>

<p>The earth, which one might take to have been brought
here in ten thousand carts, is nothing, so far as the eye can
carry, but little dusty craters, so thickly scattered that their
overlapping sides break into one another.</p>

<p>They are of every size, according to the calibre of the
shells which have made them. Inside these innumerable
volcanoes are scattered, pell-mell among the hardly-covered
bodies, all the small possessions of the soldier,
with shells that have not burst, bombs, books, letters,
bandages, blood....</p>

<p>Such is the Gully in all its tragic beauty, with its heaped-up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
soil, its road destroyed, its few trees in splinters, its
scattered graves, its scent of death, its heavy silence, its
sides pitted with shell-holes and smashed dug-outs, its dead
horses and their carrion flesh.</p>

<p>On the right, the Ancre, swollen by the rain, flows,
indifferent and peaceful, beside its slaughtered poplars;
and on the left bank the houses of bombarded Gueudecourt,
the ruins of Thiepval, and all the mourning landscape that
surrounds us, seem to advise us not to let our eyes linger
upon the ravine, and to tell us that all Nature is worthy of
our pity and that the earth has become indeed the great
valley of tears of which the psalmist sings.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_4IX" id="CHAPTER_4IX">CHAPTER IX.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">CHRISTMAS NIGHT IN "NO MAN'S LAND."</p>


<p>The setting is not a Biblical one. If, indeed, this
cursed spot can possibly recall the Book of Books, we
must search the chapter of immortal horrors in the Book
of Revelation.</p>

<p>No vegetation will grow there within the next ten
years; no ghost of a tree or shadow of a house; the moon
reveals the troubled earth whose chalky mud is as a
festering sore.</p>

<p>There is universal destruction, as though a huge tidal-wave,
overrunning the plain and the valley, had been
struck by God's anger and checked in the full force of
its rolling waters. The evening of the last day could
bring no greater melancholy. Three horrors rule this
strip of land&mdash;Fright, Death and Frost. A bitter cold
night with a starry sky&mdash;such was Christmas in "No
Man's Land."</p>

<p>And what of "man"? Here we have a Scotsman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
from the mountains, gaunt, dour, wiry, with lynx-like
eyes, the lusty chest of a woodman and the soul of a
hermit. Like hundreds of thousands and tens of hundreds
of thousands of his brother-soldiers, he had held
the line in front of Ypres, Loos and Arras. Like the
soldiers of England, Ireland and Wales, he had known
the mist of Flanders, the marshes of the mine country,
the mossy peat of Artois. Like his fellows, he is weary.
With his grey-steel helmet, the leathern, fleece-lined
waistcoat and the leggings of buffalo-hide which show
up the muscles of his legs, you might think he was a
centurion of the Roman Empire. Like all the others,
his name is Tommy.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>15. NEAR THE Y RAVINE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>This Christmas Night Tommy has a care. The
"bonnie Highland lassie" whom he was courting in the
good old days, when Highlanders had not yet earned
the ferocious nick-name of the "square-jawed," had written
to him that morning asking for a souvenir. A souvenir!</p>

<p>Those of you who have not seen Tommy, notwithstanding
the certainty of punishment, bartering his regimental
badges or buttons in exchange for a kiss from
some village beauty, can hardly understand this superstitious
worship of "a souvenir." That word sums up all
the dangers, hardships and glories of war, and is considered
the surest of love tokens. But for soldiers of
His Majesty's Guards the real souvenir is the one snatched
from the enemy in mortal combat. The day after the
Battle of the Ancre&mdash;that is, the day after the attack and
victory&mdash;I saw little groups of men scattered over the
battlefield indifferent to hostile barrages and machine-gun
fire. These men, crawling from shell-hole to shell-hole,
looked only on the ground. <i>They were souvenir
hunting.</i></p>

<p>Now for our story. Tommy is in a listening post&mdash;a
crump-hole between the two trenches surrounded with
barbed wire. The Germans are 30 yards in front and
the British 10 yards behind him. He hears the enemy's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
observers behind their loopholes stamping their feet to
keep them warm. Small clouds shade the moon. A
heavy silence pervades the frozen earth. This Highlander
is alone in "No Man's Land."</p>

<p>Is he thinking of the Christmas turkey, brown and
crackling in its juice, which has been carefully fattened
at the farm at home; of the plum-pudding, aflame with
brandy, done to a turn by his bonnie lassie? Is he thinking
of the dying embers and the midnight kiss, stolen
or given&mdash;who knows? No; Tommy is simply thinking
of "souvenirs."</p>

<p>Twice already, but in vain, he has searched his crump-hole.
He can't find the smallest relic. Creeping under
the knife rests, and separating with care the ring of wire
which the British call "trench concertina wire," he drags
himself on his stomach through the wire system. These
iron blackberries catch hold of him and prick him. He
likens himself to one of those great trench rats on a poaching
foray.</p>

<p>Suddenly his hand falls upon a human form. The
body is cold&mdash;a corpse! He remembers, a week ago, an
evening patrol was caught by our artillery fire, and this
is one of them. "No Man's Land" in this sector is not
particularly healthy, and grave-diggers are dispensed
with. This dried-up corpse was so much part of the
landscape that Tommy had not noticed it. He now
looks at it with a friendly eye. "Poor old Boche! Poor
old lump of souvenirs!" Tommy is a simple fellow.
He goes straight for what he wants. He first thought he
would take the identity-disc. That would be a fine
souvenir; but the corpse has no arms, so he gives up that
idea. "D&mdash;&mdash;d artillery that spoils even corpses!" he
grumbles, and then feels for the legs. Perhaps the old
Boche keeps a knife in his right legging. "Damn again!
There is no right leg&mdash;nor left either!" If only a sharp
breeze were to lift the clouds from the moon, the wide-open
eyes of the observers would discover in "No Man's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
Land" a great lusty Highlander, white as a sheet or as the
whitest of white Pierrots.</p>

<p>Suddenly our Highlander is seized with a mixture of
horror and rage, added to which there is a feeling of
weird pride. The living and the dead have made a
ghastly Christmas bet.</p>

<p>Tommy hovers over this wreck of a man. He seizes
the Boche's head&mdash;of course, the helmet, badges and
bandolier have disappeared.</p>

<p>The corpse, as though from the depths of the other
world, gives a horrid laugh. Tommy forces his fingers
into the grinning mouth, but the jaws shut with a spring&mdash;like
a mousetrap. False teeth! Tommy, exasperated,
seizes the grim trophy.</p>

<p>The bonnie lassie will receive shortly a gold brooch
inscribed with her name and Tommy's. She will wear
it proudly at church. She will make her friends jealous
without anyone ever suspecting the real history of the
souvenir. Perhaps it is as well!</p>

<p>Now this is not a Christmas story, but a real fact,
which happened on the evening of "Everyman's" Christmas
among the outposts before Grandcourt.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
