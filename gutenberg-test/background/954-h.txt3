Past Memories



Ceasing his restless walk up and down the room, Tom Swift strode to the
window and gazed across the field toward the many buildings, where
machines were turning out the products evolved from the brains of his
father and himself. There was a worried look on the face of the young
inventor, and he seemed preoccupied, as though thinking of something
far removed from whatever it was his eyes gazed upon.



"Well, I'll do it!" suddenly exclaimed Tom. "I don't want to, but I
will. It's in the line of 'doing my bit,' I suppose; but I'd rather it
was something else. I wonder&mdash;"



"Ha! Up to your old tricks, I see, Tom!" exclaimed a voice, in which
energy and friendliness mingled pleasingly.  "Up to your old tricks!"



"Oh, hello, Mr. Damon!" cried Tom, turning to shake hands with an
elderly gentleman&mdash;that is, elderly in appearance but not in action,
for he crossed the room with the springing step of a lad, and there was
the enthusiasm of youth on his face. "What do you mean&mdash;my old tricks?"



"Talking to yourself, Tom. And when you do that it means there is
something in the wind. I hope, as a sort of side remark, it isn't rain
that's in the wind, for the soldiers over at camp have had enough water
to set up a rival establishment with Mr. Noah. But there's something
going on, isn't there? Bless my memorandum book, but don't tell me
there isn't, or I shall begin to believe I have lost all my deductive
powers of reasoning! I come in here, after knocking two or three times,
to which you pay not the least attention, and find you mysteriously
murmuring to yourself.



"The last time that happened, Tom, was just before you started to dig
the big tunnel&mdash;No, I'm wrong. It was just before you started for the
Land of Wonders, as we decided it ought to be called. You were talking
to yourself then, when I walked in on you, and&mdash;Say, Tom!" suddenly
exclaimed Mr. Damon eagerly, "don't tell me you're going off on another
wild journey like that&mdash;don't!"



"Why?" asked Tom, smiling at the energy of his caller.



"Because if you are, I'll want to go with you, of course, and if I go
it means I'll have to start in as soon as I can to bring my wife around
to my way of thinking. The last time I went it took me two weeks to get
her to consent, and then she didn't like it. So if&mdash;"



"No, Mr. Damon," interrupted Tom, "I don't count on going on any sort
of a trip&mdash;that is, any long one. I was just getting ready to take a
little spin in the Hawk, and if you'd like to come along&mdash;"



"You mean that saucy little airship of yours, Tom, that's always trying
to sit down on her tail, or tickle herself with one wing?"



"That's the Hawk!" laughed Tom; "though that tickling business you
speak of is when I spiral. Don't you like it?"



"Can't say I do," observed Mr. Damon dryly.



"Well, I'll promise not to try any stunts if you come along," Tom went
on.



"Where are you going?" asked his friend.



"Oh, no place in particular. As you surmised, I've been doing a bit of
thinking, and&mdash;"



"Serious thinking, too, Tom!" interrupted Mr. Damon.  "Excuse me, but I
couldn't help overhearing what you said.  It was something about going
to do something though you didn't want to, and that it was part of your
'bit'. That sounds like soldier talk. Are you going to enlist, Tom?"



"No."



"Um! Well, then&mdash;"



"It's something I can't talk about, Mr. Damon, even to you, as yet,"
Tom said, and there was a new quality in his voice, at which his friend
looked up in some surprise.



"Oh, of course, Tom, if it's a secret&mdash;"



"Well, it hasn't even got that far, as yet. It's all up in the air, so
to speak. I'll tell you in due season. But, speaking of the air, let's
go for a spin. It may drive some of the cobwebs out of my brain. Did I
hear you say you thought it would rain?"



"No, it's as clear as a bell. I said I hoped it wouldn't rain for the
sake of the soldiers in camp. They've had their share of wet weather,
and, goodness knows, they'll get more when they get to Flanders. It
seems to do nothing but rain in France."



"It is damp," agreed Tom. "And, come to think of it, they are going to
have some airship contests over at camp to-day&mdash;for the men who are
being trained to be aviators, you know.  It just occurred to me that we
might fly over there and watch them."



"Fine!" cried Mr. Damon. "That's the very thing I should like. I'll
take a chance in your Hawk, Tom, if you'll promise not to try any
spiral stunts."



"I promise, Mr. Damon. Come on! I'll have Koku run the machine out and
get her ready for a flight to Camp. It's a good day for a jaunt in the
air."



"Get out the Hawk, Koku," ordered the young inventor, as he motioned to
a big man&mdash;a veritable giant&mdash;who nodded to show he understood. Koku
was really a giant, one of a race of strange beings, and Tom Swift had
brought the big man with him when he escaped from captivity, as those
will remember who have read that book.



"Going far, Tom?" asked an aged man, coming to the door of one of the
many buildings of which the shed where the airship was kept formed one.



"Not very far, Father," answered the young inventor.  "Mr. Damon and I
are going for a little spin over to Camp Grant, to see some aircraft
contests among the army birdmen."



"Oh, all right, Tom. I just wanted to tell you that I think I've gotten
over that difficulty you found with the big carburetor you were working
on. You didn't say what you wanted it for, except that it was for a
heavy duty gasolene engine, and you couldn't get the needle valve to
work as you'd like. I think I've found a way."



"Good, Dad! I'll look at it when I come back. That carburetor did
bother me, and if I can get that to work&mdash;well, maybe we'll have
something soon that will&mdash;"



But Tom did not finish his sentence, for Koku was getting the aircraft
in operation and Mr. Damon was already taking his place behind the
pilot's seat, which would be occupied by Tom.



"All ready, are you, Koku?" asked the young inventor.



"All ready, Master," answered the giant.



There was a roar like that of a machine gun as the Hawk's engine spun
the propeller, and then, after a little run across the sod, it mounted
into the air, carrying Tom and Mr. Damon with it.



"Mind you, Tom, no stunts!" called the visitor to the young inventor
through the speaking tube apparatus, which enabled a conversation to be
carried on, even above the roar of the powerful engine. "Bless my
overshoes! if you try, looping the loop with me&mdash;"



"I won't do anything like that!" promised Tom.



Away they soared, swift as a veritable hawk, and soon, after there had
unrolled below their eyes a succession of fields and forest, there came
into view rows and rows of small brown objects, among which beings,
like ants, seemed crawling about.



"There's the Camp!" exclaimed Tom.



"I see," and Mr. Damon nodded.



As they approached, they saw, starting up from a green space amid the
brown tents, what appeared to be big bugs of a dirty white color
splotched with green.



"The aircraft&mdash;and they have camouflage paint on," said Tom. "We can
watch 'em from up here!"



Mr. Damon nodded, though Tom could not see him, sitting in front of his
friend as he was.



Up and up circled the army aircraft, and they seemed to bow and nod a
greeting to the Hawk, which was soon in the midst of them. Tom and Mr.
Damon, flying high, though at no great speed, looked at the maneuvers
of the veterans and the learners&mdash;many of whom might soon be engaging
the Boches in far-off France.



"Some of 'em are pretty good!" called Tom, through the tube. "That one
fellow did the loop as prettily as I've ever seen it done," and Tom
Swift had a right to speak as one of authority.



Tom and his friend watched the aircraft for some time, and then started
off in a long flight, attaining a high speed, which, at first, made Mr.
Damon gasp, until he became used to it. He was no novice at flying, and
had even operated aeroplanes himself, though at no great height.



Suddenly the Hawk seemed to falter, almost as does a bird stricken by a
hunter's gun. The craft seemed to hang in the air, losing motion as
though about to plunge to earth unguided.



"What's the matter?" cried Mr. Damon.



"One of the control wires broken!" was Tom's laconic answer. "I'll have
to volplane down. Sit tight, there's no danger!"



Mr. Damon knew that with so competent a pilot as Tom Swift in the
forward seat this was true, but, nevertheless, he was a bit nervous
until he felt the smooth, gliding motion, with now and then an upward
tilt, which showed that Tom was coming down from the upper regions in a
series of long glides. The engine had stopped, and the cessation of the
thundering noise made it possible for Tom and his passenger to talk
without the use of the speaking tube.



"All right?" asked Mr. Damon.



"All right," Tom answered, and a little later the machine was rolling
gently over the turf of a large field, a mile or so from the camp.



Before Tom and Mr. Damon could get out of their seats, a man, seemingly
springing up from some hollow in the ground, walked toward them.



"Had an accident?" he asked, in what he evidently meant for a friendly
voice.



"A little one, easily mended," Tom answered.



He was about to take off his goggles, but at sight of the man's face a
change came over the countenance of Tom Swift, and he replaced the eye
protectors. Then Tom turned to Mr. Damon, as if to ask a question, but
the stranger came so close, evidently curious to see the aircraft at
close quarters, that the young inventor could not speak without being
overheard.



Tom got out his kit of tools to repair the broken control, and the man
watched him curiously. As he tinkered away, something was stirring
among the past memories of the inventor. A question he asked himself
over and over again was:



"Where have I seen this man before?  His face is familiar, but I can't
place him. He is associated with something unpleasant. But where have I
seen this man before?"






Chapter II



Tom's Indifference



"Did you make this machine yourself?" asked the stranger of Tom, as the
young inventor worked at the damaged part of his craft.



Mr. Damon had also alighted, taken off his goggles, and was looking
aloft, where the army aircraft were going through various evolutions,
and down below, where the young soldiers were drilling under such
conditions, as far as possible, as they might meet with when some of
their number went "over the top." Mr. Damon was murmuring to himself
such remarks as:



"Bless my fountain pen! look at that chap turning upside down! Bless my
inkwell!"



"I beg your pardon," remarked Tom Swift, following the remark of the
man, whose face he was trying to recall. It was not that Tom had not
heard the question, but he was trying to gain time before answering.



"I asked if you made this machine yourself," went on the man, as he
peered about at the Hawk. "It isn't like any I've ever seen before, and
I know something about airships. It has some new wrinkles on it, and I
thought you might have evolved them yourself. Not that it's an amateur
affair, by any means!" he added hastily, as if fearing the young
inventor might resent the implication that his machine was a home-made
product.



"Yes, I originated this," answered Tom, as he put a new turn-buckle in
place; "but I didn't actually construct it&mdash;that is, except for some
small parts. It was made in the shop&mdash;"



"Over at the army construction plant, I presume," interrupted the man
quickly, as he motioned toward the big factory, not far from Shopton,
where aircraft for Uncle Sam's Army were being turned out by the
hundreds.



"Might as well let him think that," mused Tom; "at least until I can
figure out who he is and what he wants."



"This is different from most of those up there," and the stranger
pointed toward the circling craft on high. "A bit more speedy, I guess,
isn't it?"



"Well, yes, in a way," agreed Tom, who was bending over his craft. He
stole a side look at the man. The face was becoming more and more
familiar, yet something about it puzzled Tom Swift.



"I've seen him before, and yet he didn't look like that," thought the
young inventor. "It's different, somehow. Now why should my memory play
me a trick like this? Who in the world can he be?"



Tom straightened up, and tossed a monkey wrench into the tool box.



"Get everything fixed?" asked the stranger.



"I think so," and the young inventor tried to make his answer pleasant.
"It was only a small break, easily fixed."



"Then you'll be on your way again?"



"Yes. Are you ready?" called Tom to Mr. Damon.



"Bless my timetable, yes! I didn't think you'd start back again so
soon. There's one young fellow up there who has looped the loop three
times, and I expect him to fall any minute."



"Oh, I guess he knows his business," Tom said easily.  "We'll be
getting back now."



"One moment!" called the man. "I beg your pardon for troubling you, but
you seem to be a mechanic, and that's just the sort of man I'm looking
for. Are you open to an offer to do some inventive and constructive
work?"



Tom was on his guard instantly.



"Well, I can't say that I am," he answered. "I am pretty busy&mdash;"



"This would pay well," went on the man eagerly. "I am a stranger around
here, but I can furnish satisfactory references. I am in need of a good
mechanic, an inventor as well, who can do what you seem to have done so
well. I had hopes of getting some one at the army plant."



"I guess they're not letting any of their men go," said Tom, as Mr.
Damon climbed to his seat in the Hawk.



"No, I soon found that out. But I thought perhaps you&mdash;"



Tom shook his head.



"I'm sorry," he answered, "but I'm otherwise engaged, and very busy."



"One moment!" called the man, as he saw Tom about to start "Is the
Swift Company plant far from here?"



Tom felt something like a thrill go through him. There was an
unexpected note in the man's voice. The face of the young inventor
lightened, and the doubts melted away.



"No, it isn't far," Tom answered, shouting to be heard above the
crackling bangs of the motor. And then, as the craft soared into the
air, he cried exultingly:



"I have it! I know who he is! The scoundrel! His beard fooled me, and
he probably didn't know me with these goggles on. But now I know him!"



"Bless my calendar!" cried Mr. Damon. "What are you talking about?"



But Tom did not answer, for the reason that just then the Hawk fell
into an "air pocket," and needed all his attention to straighten her
out and get her on a level course again.



And while Tom Swift is thus engaged in speeding his aircraft along the
upper regions toward his home, it will take but a few moments to
acquaint my new readers with something of the history of the young
inventor. Those who have read the previous books in this series need be
told nothing about our hero.



Tom Swift was an inventor of note, as was his father. Mr. Swift was now
quite aged and not in robust health, but he was active at times and
often aided Tom when some knotty point came up.



Tom and his father lived on the outskirts of the town of Shopton, and
near their home were various buildings in which the different machines
and appliances were made. Tom's mother was dead, but Mrs. Baggert, the
housekeeper, was as careful in looking after Tom and his father as any
woman could be.



In addition to these three, the household consisted of Eradicate
Sampson, an aged colored servant, and, it might almost be added, his
mule Boomerang; but Boomerang had manners that, at times, did not make
him a welcome addition to any household. Then there was the giant Koku,
one of two big men Tom had brought back with him from the land where
the young inventor had been held captive for a time.



The first book of this series is called "Tom Swift and His Motor
Cycle," and it was in acquiring possession of that machine that Tom met
his friend Mr. Wakefield Damon, who lived in a neighboring town. Mr.
Damon owned the motor cycle originally, but when it attempted to climb
a tree with him he sold it to Tom.



Tom had many adventures on the machine, and it started him on his
inventive career. From then on he had had a series of surprising
adventures. He had traveled in his motor boat, in an airship, and then
had taken to a submarine. In his electric runabout he showed what the
speediest car on the road could do, and when he sent his wireless
message, the details of which can be found set down in the volume of
that name, Tom saved the castaways of Earthquake Island.



Tom Swift had many other thrilling escapes, one from among the diamond
makers, and another from the caves of ice; and he made the quickest
flight on record in his sky racer.



Tom's wizard camera, his great searchlight, his giant cannon, his photo
telephone, his aerial warship and the big tunnel he helped to dig,
brought him credit, fame, and not a little money. He had not long been
back from an expedition to Honduras, dubbed "the land of wonders," when
he was again busy on some of his many ideas. And it was to get some
relief from his thoughts that he had taken the flight with Mr. Damon on
the day the present story opens.



"What are you so excited about, Tom?" asked his friend, as the Hawk
alighted near the shed back of the young inventor's home. "Bless my
scarf pin! but any one would think you'd just discovered the true
method of squaring the circle."



"Well, it's almost as good as that, and more practical," Tom said, with
a smile, as he motioned to Koku to put away the aircraft "I know who
that man is, now."



"What man, Tom?"



"The one who was questioning me when I was fixing the airship. I kept
puzzling and puzzling as to his identity, and, all at once, it came to
me. Do you know who he is, Mr. Damon?"



"No, I can't say that I do, Tom. But, as you say, there was something
vaguely familiar about him. It seemed as if I must have seen him
before, and yet&mdash;"



"That's just the way it struck me. What would you say if I told you
that man was Blakeson, of Blakeson and Grinder, the rival tunnel
contractors who made such trouble for us?"



"You mean down in Peru, Tom?"



"Yes."



Mr. Damon started in surprise, and then exclaimed:



"Bless my ear mufflers, Tom, but you're right! That was Blakeson! I
didn't know him with his beard, but that was Blakeson, all right! Bless
my foot-warmer! What do you suppose he is doing around here?"



"I don't know, Mr. Damon, but I'd give a good deal to know. It isn't
any good, I'll wager on that. He didn't seem to know me or you,
either&mdash;unless he did and didn't let on.  I suppose it was because of
my goggles&mdash;and you were gazing up in the air most of the time. I don't
think he knew either of us."



"It didn't seem so, Tom. But what is he doing here? Do you think he is
working at the army camp, or helping make Liberty Motors for the
aircraft that are going to beat the Germans?"



"Hardly. He didn't seem to be connected with the camp. He wanted a
mechanic, and hinted that I might do. Jove! if he really didn't know
who I was, and finds out, say! won't he be surprised?"



"Rather," agreed Mr Damon. "Well, Tom, I had a nice little ride. And
now I must be getting back. But if you contemplate a trip anywhere,
don't forget to let me know."



"I don't count on going anywhere soon," Tom answered. "I have something
on hand that will occupy all my time, though I don't just like it.
However, I'm going to do my best," and he waved good-bye to Mr. Damon,
who went off blessing various parts of his anatomy or clothing, an odd
habit he had.



As Tom turned to go into the house, the unsettled look still on his
face, some one hailed him.



"I say, Tom. Hello! Wait a minute! I've got something to show you!"



"Oh, hello, Ned Newton!" Called back the young inventor.  "Well, if
it's Liberty Bonds, you don't need to show me any, for dad and I will
buy all we can without seeing them."



"I know that, Tom, and it was a dandy subscription you gave me. I
didn't come about that, though I may be around the next time Uncle Sam
wants the people to dig down in their socks. This is something
different," and Ned Newton, a young banker of Shopton and a lifelong
friend of Tom's, drew a paper from his pocket as he advanced across the
lawn.



"There, Tom Swift!" he cried, flipping out an illustrated page,
evidently from some illustrated newspaper. "There's the very latest
from the other side. A London banker friend of mine sent it to me, and
it got past the censor all right.  It's the first authentic photograph
of the newest and biggest British tank. Isn't that a wonder?"



Ned held up the paper which had in it a fullpage photograph of a
monster tank&mdash;those weird machines traveling on endless steel belts of
caterpillar construction, armored, riveted and plated, with machine
guns bristling here and there.



"Isn't that great, Tom? Can you beat it? It's the most wonderful
machine of the age, even counting some of yours.  Can you beat it?"



Tom took the paper indifferently, and his manner surprised his chum.



"Well, what's the matter, Tom?" asked Ned. "Don't you think that great?
Why don't you say something? You don't mean to say you've seen that
picture before?"



"No, Ned."



"Then what's the matter with you? Isn't that wonderful?"






Chapter III



Ned is Worried



Tom Swift did not answer for several seconds. He stood holding the
paper Ned had given him, the sun slanting on the picture of the big
British tank. But the young inventor did not appear to see it. Instead,
his eyes were as though contemplating something afar off.



"Well, this gets me!" cried Ned, his voice showing impatience. "Here I
go and get a picture of the latest machine the British armies are
smashing up the Boches with, and bring it to you fresh from the mail&mdash;I
even quit my Liberty Bond business to do it, and I know some dandy
prospects, too&mdash;and here you look at it like a&mdash;like a fish!" burst out
Ned.



"Say, old man, I guess that's right!" admitted Tom. "I wasn't thinking
about it, to tell you the truth."



"Why not?" Ned demanded. "Isn't it great, Tom? Did you ever see
anything like it?"



"Yes."



"You did?" Cried Ned, in surprise. "Where? Say, Tom Swift, are you
keeping something from me?"



"I mean no, Ned. I never have seen a British tank."



"Well, did you ever see a picture like this before?" Ned persisted.



"No, not exactly like that But&mdash;"



"Well, what do you think of it?" cried the young banker, who was giving
much of his time to selling bonds for the Government. "Isn't it great?"



Tom considered a moment before replying. Then he said slowly:



"Well, yes, Ned, it is a pretty good machine. But&mdash;"



"'But!' Howling tomcats! Say, what's the 'matter with you, anyhow, Tom?
This is great! 'But!' 'But me no buts!' This is, without exception, the
greatest thing out since an airship. It will win the war for us and the
Allies, too, and don't you forget it! Fritz's barbed wire and dugouts
and machine gun emplacements can't stand for a minute against these
tanks! Why, Tom, they can crawl on their back as well as any other way,
and they don't mind a shower of shrapnel or a burst of machine gun
lead, any more than an alligator minds a swarm of gnats. The only thing
that makes 'em hesitate a bit is a Jack Johnson or a Bertha shell, and
it's got to be a pretty big one, and in the right place, to do much
damage. These tanks are great, and there's nothing like 'em."



"Oh, yes there is, Ned!"



"There is!" cried Ned. "What do you mean?"



"I mean there may be something like them&mdash;soon."



"There may? Say, Tom&mdash;"



"Now don't ask me a lot of questions, Ned, for I can't answer them.
When I say there may be something like them, I mean it isn't beyond the
realms of possibility that some one&mdash;perhaps the Germans&mdash;may turn out
even bigger and better tanks."



"Oh!" And Ned's voice showed his disappointment. "I thought maybe you
were in on that game yourself, Tom. Say, couldn't you get up something
almost as good as this?" and he indicated the picture in the paper.
"Isn't that wonderful?"



"Oh, well, it's good, Ned, but there are others. Yes, Dad, I'm coming,"
he called, as he saw his father beckoning to him from a distant
building.



"Well, I've got to get along," said Ned. "But I certainly am
disappointed, Tom. I thought you'd go into a fit over this
picture&mdash;it's one of the first allowed to get out of England, my London
friend said. And instead of enthusing you're as cold as a clam;" and
Ned shook his head in puzzled and disappointed fashion as he walked
slowly along beside the young inventor.



They passed a new building, one of the largest in the group of the many
comprising the Swift plant. Ned looked at the door which bore a notice
to the effect that no one was admitted unless bearing a special permit,
or accompanied by Mr. Swift or Tom.



"What's this, Tom?" asked Ned. "Some new wrinkle?"



"Yes, an invention I'm working on. It isn't in shape yet to be seen."



"It must be something big, Tom," observed Ned, as he viewed the large
building.



"It is."



"And say, what a whopping big fence you've got around the back yard!"
went on the young banker. "Looks like a baseball field, but it would
take some scrambling on the part of a back-lots kid to get over it."



"That's what it's for&mdash;to keep people out."



"I see! Well, I've got to get along. I'm a bit back in my day's quota
of selling Liberty Bonds, and I've got to hustle. I'm sorry I bothered
you about that tank picture, Tom."



"Oh, it wasn't a bother&mdash;don't think that for a minute, Ned! I was glad
to see it."



"Well, he didn't seem so, and his manner was certainly queer," mused
Ned, as he walked away, and turned in time to see Tom enter the new
building, which had such a high fence all around it. "I never saw him
more indifferent. I wonder if Tom isn't interested in seeing Uncle Sam
help win this war?  That's the way it struck me. I thought surely Tom
would go up in the air, and say this was a dandy," and Ned unfolded the
paper and took another look at the British tank photograph. "If there's
anything can beat that I'd like to see it," he mused.



"But I suppose Tom has discovered some new kind of air stabilizer, or a
different kind of carburetor that will vaporize kerosene as well as
gasolene. If he has, why doesn't he offer it to Uncle Sam? I wonder if
Tom is pro-German?  No, of Course he can't be!" and Ned laughed at his
own idea.



"At the same time, it is queer," he mused on. "There is something wrong
with Tom Swift."



Once more Ned looked at the picture. It was a representation of one of
the newest and largest of the British tanks. In appearance these are
not unlike great tanks, though they are neither round nor square, being
shaped, in fact, like two wedges with the broad ends put together, and
the sharper ends sticking out, though there is no sharpness to a tank,
the "noses" both being blunt.



Around each outer edge runs an endless belt of steel plates, hinged
together, with ridges at the joints, and these broad belts of steel
plates, like the platforms of some moving stairways used in department
stores, moving around, give motion to the tank.



Inside, well protected from the fire of enemy guns by steel plates, are
the engines for driving the belts, or caterpillar wheels, as they are
called. There is also the steering apparatus, and the guns that fire on
the enemy.  There are cramped living and sleeping quarters for the
tank's crew, more limited than those of a submarine.



The tank is ponderous, the smallest of them, which were those first
constructed, weighing forty-two tons, or about as much as a good-sized
railroad freight car. And it is this ponderosity, with its slow but
resistless movement, that gives the tank its power.



The tank, by means of the endless belts of steel plates, can travel
over the roughest country. It can butt into a tree, a stone wall, or a
house, knock over the obstruction, mount it, crawl over it, and slide
down into a hole on the other side and crawl out again, on the level,
or at an angle. Even if overturned, the tanks can sometimes right
themselves and keep on. At the rear are trailer wheels, partly used in
steering and partly for reaching over gaps or getting out of holes. The
tanks can turn in their own length, by moving one belt in one direction
and the other oppositely.



Inside there is nothing much but machinery of the gasolene type, and
the machine guns. The tank is closed except for small openings out of
which the guns project, and slots through which the men inside look out
to guide themselves or direct their fire.



Such, in brief, is a British tank, one of the most powerful and
effective weapons yet loosed against the Germans. They are useful in
tearing down the barbed-wire entanglements on the Boche side of No
Man's Land, and they can clear the way up to and past the trenches,
which they can straddle and wriggle across like some giant worm.



"And to think that Tom Swift didn't enthuse over these!" murmured Ned.
"I wonder what's the matter with him!"






Chapter IV



Queer Doings



There was a subdued air of activity about the Swift plant.  Subdued,
owing to the fact that it was mostly confined to one building&mdash;the new,
large one, about which stretched a high and strong fence, made with
tongue-and-groove boards so that no prying eyes might find a crack,
even, through which to peer.



In and out of the other buildings the workmen went as they pleased,
though there were not many of them, for Tom and his father were
devoting most of their time and energies to what was taking place in
the big, new structure. But here there was an entirely different
procedure.



Workmen went in and out, to be sure, but each time they emerged they
were scrutinized carefully, and when they went in they had to exhibit
their passes to a man on guard at the single entrance; and the passes
were not scrutinized perfunctorily, either.



Near the building, about which there seemed to be an air of mystery,
one day, a week after the events narrated in the opening chapters,
strolled the giant Koku. Not far away, raking up a pile of refuse, was
Eradicate Sampson, the aged colored man of all work. Eradicate
approached nearer and nearer the entrance to the building, pursuing his
task of gathering up leaves, dirt and sticks with the teeth of his
rake. Then Koku, who had been lounging on a bench in the shade of a
tree, Called:



"No more, Eradicate!"



"No mo' whut?" asked the negro quickly.  "I didn't axt yo' fo' nuffin
yit!"



"No more come here!" said the giant, pointing to the building and
speaking English with an evident effort.  "Master say no one come too
close."



"Huh! He didn't go fo' t' mean me!" exclaimed Eradicate.  "I kin go
anywheres; I kin!"



"Not here!" and Koku interposed his giant frame between the old man and
the first step leading into the secret building. "You no come in here."



"Who say so?"



"Me&mdash;I say so! I on guard. I what you call special
policeman&mdash;detectiff&mdash;no let enemies in!"



"Huh! You's a hot deteckertiff, yo' is!" snorted Eradicate. "Anyhow,
dem orders don't mean me! I kin go anywhere, I kin!"



"Not here!" said Koku firmly. "Master Tom say let nobody come near but
workmen who have got writing-paper. You no got!"



"No, but I kin git one, an' I's gwine t' hab it soon! I'll see Massa
Tom, dat's whut I will. I guess yo' ain't de only deteckertiff on de
place. I kin go on guard, too!" and Eradicate, dropping his rake,
strolled away in his temper to seek the young inventor.



"Well, Rad, what is it?" asked Tom, as he met the colored man. The
young inventor was on his way to the mysterious shop. "What is
troubling you?"



"It's dat dar giant. He done says as how he's on guard&mdash;a
deteckertiff&mdash;an' I can't go nigh dat buildin' t' sweep up de refuse."



"Well, that's right, Rad. I'd prefer that you keep away.  I'm doing
some special work in there and it's&mdash;"



"Am it dangerous, Massa Tom? I ain't askeered! Anybody whut kin drive
mah mule Boomerang&mdash;"



"I know, Eradicate, but this isn't so dangerous. It's just secret, and
I don't want too many people about. You can go anywhere else except
there. Koku is on guard."



"Den can't I be, Massa Tom?" asked the colored man eagerly. "I kin
guard an' detect same as dat low-down, good-fo'-nuffin white trash
Koku!"



Tom hesitated.



"I suppose I could get you a sort of officer's badge," he mused, half
aloud.



"Dat's whut I want!" eagerly exclaimed Eradicate. "I ain't gwine hab
dat Koku&mdash;dat cocoanut&mdash;crowin' ober me! I kin guard an' detect as
good's anybody!"



And the upshot of it was that Eradicate was given a badge, and put on a
special post, far enough from Koku to keep the two from quarreling, and
where, even if he failed in keeping a proper lookout, the old servant
could do no harm by his oversight.



"It'll please him, and won't hurt us," said Tom to his father. "Koku
will keep out any prying persons."



"I suppose you are doing well to keep it a secret, Tom," said Mr.
Swift, "but it seems as if you might announce it soon."



"Perhaps we may, Dad, if all goes well. I've given her a partial
shop-tryout, and she works well. But there is still plenty to do. Did I
tell you about meeting Blakeson?"



"Yes, and I can't understand why he should be in this vicinity. Do you
think he has had any intimation of what you are doing?"



"It's hard to say, and yet I would not be surprised. When Uncle Sam
couldn't keep secret the fact of our first soldiers sailing for France.
How can I expect to keep this secret? But they won't get any details
until I'm ready, I'm sure of that."



"Koku is a good discourager," said Mr. Swift, with a chuckle. "You
couldn't have a better guard, Tom."



"No, and if I can keep him and Eradicate from trying to pull off rival
detective stunts, or 'deteckertiff,' as Rad calls it, I'll be all
right. Now let's have another go at that carburetor. There's our weak
point, for it's getting harder and harder all the while to get
high-grade gasolene, and we'll have to come to alcohol of low proof, or
kerosene, I'm thinking."



"I wouldn't be surprised, Tom. Well, perhaps we can get up a new style
of carburetor that will do the trick. Now look at this needle valve;
I've given it a new turn," and father and son went into technical
details connected with their latest invention.



These were busy days at the Swift plant. Men came and went&mdash;men with
queerly shaped parcels frequently&mdash;and they were admitted to the big
new building after first passing Eradicate and then Koku, and it would
be hard to say which guard was the more careful. Only, of course, Koku
had the final decision, and more than one person was turned back after
Eradicate had passed him, much to the disgust of the negro.



"Pooh! Dat giant don't know a workman when he sees 'im!" snorted
Eradicate. "He so lazy his own se'f dat he don't know a workman! Ef I
sees a spy, Massa Tom, or a crook, I's gwine git him, suah pop!"



"I hope you do, Rad. We can't afford to let this secret get out," said
the young inventor.



It was one evening, when taking a short cut to his home, that Mr.
Nestor, the father of Mary Nestor, in whom Tom was more than ordinarily
interested, passed not far from the big enclosure which was guarded, on
the factory side, day and night. Inside, though out of sight and hidden
by the high fence, were other guards.



As Mr. Nestor passed along the fence, rather vaguely wondering why it
was so high, tight and strong, he felt the ground trembling beneath his
feet. It rumbled and shook as though a distant train were passing, and
yet there was none due now, for Mr. Nestor had just left one, and
another would not arrive for an hour.



"That's queer," mused Mary's father. "If I didn't know to the contrary,
I'd say that sounded like heavy guns being fired from a distance, or
else blasting. It seems to come from the Swift place," he went on. "I
wonder what they're up to in there."



Suddenly the rumbling became more pronounced, and mingled with it, in
the dusk of the evening, were the shouts of men.



"Look out!" some one cried. "She's going for the fence!"



A second later there was a cracking and straining of boards, and the
fence near Mr. Nestor bulged out as though something big, powerful and
mighty were pressing it from the inner side.



But the fence held, or else the pressure was removed, for the bulge
went back into place, though some of the boards were splintered.



"Have to patch that up in the morning," called another voice, and Mr.
Nestor recognized it as that of Tom Swift.



"What queer doings are going on here?" mused Mary's father. "Have they
got a wild bull shut up in there, and is he trying to get out? Lucky
for me he didn't," and he hurried on, the rumbling noise become fainter
until it died away altogether.



That night, after his supper and while reading the paper and smoking a
cigar, Mr. Nestor spoke to his daughter.



"Mary, have you seen anything of Tom Swift lately?"



"Why, yes, Father. He was over for a little while the other night, but
he didn't stay long. Why do you ask?"



"Oh, nothing special. I just came past his place and I heard some queer
noises, that's all. He's up to some more of his tricks, I guess. Has be
enlisted yet?"



"No.



"Is he going to?"



"I don't know," and Mary seemed a bit put out by this simple question.
"What do you mean by his tricks?" she asked, and a close observer might
have thought she was anxious to get away from the subject of Tom's
enlistment.



"Oh, like that one when he sent you something in a box labeled
'dynamite,' and gave us all a scare. You can't tell what Tom Swift is
going to do next. He's up to something now, I'll wager, and I don't
believe any good will come of it."



"You didn't think so after he sent his wireless message, and saved us
from Earthquake Island," said Mary, smiling.



"Hum! Well, that was different," snapped Mr. Nestor. "This time I'm
sure he's up to some nonsense! The idea of crashing down a fence! Why
doesn't he enlist like the other chaps, or sell Liberty Bonds like Ned
Newton?" and Mr. Nestor looked sharply at his daughter. "Ned gave up a
big salary as the Swifts financial man&mdash;a place he had held for a
year&mdash;to go back to the bank for less, just so he could help the
Government in the financial end of this war. Is Tom doing as much for
his country?"



"I'm sure I don't know," answered Mary; and soon after, with averted
face, she left the room.



"Hum! Queer goings on," mused Mr. Nestor. "Tom Swift may be all right,
but he's got an unbalanced streak in him that will bear looking out
for, that's what I think!"



And having settled this matter, at least to his own satisfaction, Mr.
Nestor resumed his smoking and reading.



A little later the bell rang. There was a murmur of voices in the hall,
and Mr. Nestor, half listening, heard a voice he knew.



"There's Tom Swift now!" he exclaimed. "I'm going to find out why he
doesn't enlist!"






Chapter V



"Is He a Slacker?"



Mr. Nestor, whatever else he was, proved to be a prudent father. He did
not immediately go into the front room, whither Mary and Tom hastened,
their voices mingling in talk and laughter.



Mr. Nestor, after leaving the young folks alone for a while, with a
loud "Ahem!" and a rattling of his paper as he laid it aside, started
for the parlor.



"Good-evening, Mr. Nestor!" said Tom, rising to shake hands with the
father of his young and pretty hostess.



"Hello, Tom!" was the cordial greeting, in return. "What's going on up
at your place?" went on Mr. Nestor, as he took a chair.



"Oh, nothing very special," Tom answered. "We're turning out different
kinds of machines as usual, and dad and I are experimenting, also as
usual."



"I suppose so. But what nearly broke the fence to-night?"



Tom started, and looked quickly at his host.



"Were you there?" he asked quickly.



"Well, I happened to be passing&mdash;took a short cut home&mdash;and I heard
some queer goings on at your place. I was speaking to Mary about them,
and wondering&mdash;"



"Father, perhaps Tom doesn't want to talk about his inventions,"
interrupted Mary. "You know some of them are secret&mdash;"



"Oh, I wasn't exactly asking for information!" exclaimed Mr. Nestor
quickly. "I just happened to hear the fence crash, and I was wondering
if something was coming out at me. Didn't know but what that giant of
yours was on a rampage, Tom," and he laughed.



"No, it wasn't anything like that," and Tom's voice was more sober than
the occasion seemed to warrant. "It was one of our new machines, and it
didn't act just right. No great damage was done, though. How do you
find business, Mr. Nestor, since the war spirit has grown stronger?"
asked Tom, and it seemed to both Mary and her father that the young
inventor deliberately changed the subject.



"Well, it isn't all it might be," said the other. "It's hard to get
good help. A lot of our boys enlisted, and some were taken in the
draft. By the way, Tom, have they called on you yet?"



"No. Not yet."



"You didn't enlist?"



"Ned Newton tried to," broke in Mary, "but the quota for this locality
was filled, and they told him he'd better wait for the draft. He
wouldn't do that and tried again. Then the bank people heard about it
and had him exempted. They said he was too valuable to them, and he has
been doing remarkably well in selling Liberty Bonds!" and Mary's eyes
sparkled with her emotions.



"Yes, Ned is a crackerjack salesman!" agreed Tom, no less
enthusiastically. "He's sold more bonds, in proportion, for his bank,
than any other in this county. Dad and I both took some, and have
promised him more. I am glad now that we let him go, although we valued
his services highly. We hope to have him back later."



"He can put me down for more bonds too!" said Mr. Nestor.  "I'm going
to see Germany beaten if it takes every last dollar I have!"



"That's what I say!" Cried Mary. "I took out all my savings, except a
little I'm keeping to buy a wedding present for Jennie Morse. Did you
know she was going to get married, Tom?" she asked.



"I heard so."



"Well, all but what I want for a wedding present to her has gone into
Liberty Bonds. Isn't this a history-making time, Tom?"



"Indeed it is, Mary!"



"Everybody who has a part in it&mdash;whether he fights as a soldier or only
knits like the Red Cross girls&mdash;will be telling about it for years
after," went on the girl, and she looked at Tom eagerly.



"Yes," he agreed. "These are queer times. We don't know exactly where
we're at. A lot of our men have been called.  We tried to have some of
them exempted, and did manage it in a few cases."



"You did?" cried Mr. Nestor, as if in surprise. "You stopped men from
going to war!"



"Only so they could work on airship motors for the Government," Tom
quietly explained.



"Oh! Well, of course, that's part of the game," agreed Mary's father.
"A lot more of our boys are going off next week. Doesn't it make you
thrill, Tom, when you see them marching off, even if they haven't their
uniforms yet? Jove, if I wasn't too old, I'd go in a minute!"



"Father!" cried Mary.



"Yes, I would!" he declared. "The German government has got to be
beaten, and we've got to do our bit; everybody has&mdash;man, woman and
child!"



"Yes," agreed Tom, in a low voice, "that's very true. But every one, in
a sense, has to judge for himself what the 'bit' is. We can't all do
the same."



There was a little silence, and then Mary went over to the piano and
played. It was a rather welcome relief, under the circumstances, from
the conversation.



"Mary, what do you think of Tom?" asked Mr. Nestor, when the visitor
had gone.



"What do I think of him?" And she blushed.



"I mean about his not enlisting. Do you think he's a slacker?"



"A slacker? Why, Father!"



"Oh, I don't mean he's afraid. We've seen proof enough of his courage,
and all that. But I mean don't you think he wants stirring up a bit?"



"He is going to Washington to-morrow, Father. He told me so to-night.
And it may be&mdash;"



"Oh, well, then maybe it's all right," hastily said Mr. Nestor. "He may
be going to get a commission in the engineer corps. It isn't like Tom
Swift to hang back, and yet it does begin to look as though he cared
more for his queer inventions&mdash;machines that butt down fences than for
helping Uncle Sam. But I'll reserve judgment."



"You'd better, Father!" and Mary laughed&mdash;a little. Yet there was a
worried look on her face.



During the next few nights Mr. Nestor made it a habit to take the short
cut from the railroad station, coming past the big fence that enclosed
one particular building of the Swift plant.



"I wonder if there's a hole where I could look through," said Mr.
Nestor to himself. "Of course I don't believe in spying on what another
man is doing, and yet I'm too good a friend of Tom's to want to see him
make a fool of himself.  He ought to be in the army, or helping Uncle
Sam in some way. And yet if he spends all his time on some foolish
contraption, like a new kind of traction plow, what good is that? If I
could get a glimpse of it, I might drop a friendly hint in his ear."



But there were no cracks in the fence, or, if there were, it was too
dark to see them, and also too dark to behold anything on the other
side of the barrier. So Mr. Nestor, wondering much, kept on his way.



It was a day or so after this that Ned Newton paid a visit to the Swift
home. Mr. Swift was not in the house, being out in one of the various
buildings, Mrs. Baggert said.



"Where's Tom?" asked the bond salesman.



"Oh, he hasn't come back from Washington yet," answered the housekeeper.



"He is making a long stay."



"Yes, he went about a week ago on some business. But we expect him back
to-day."



"Well, then I'll see him. I called to ask if Mr. Swift didn't want to
take a few more bonds. We want to double our allotment for Shopton, and
beat out some of the other towns in this section. I'll go to see Mr.
Swift."



On his way to find Tom's father Ned passed the big building in front of
which Eradicate and Koku were on guard.  They nodded to Ned, who passed
them, wondering much as to what it was Tom was so secretive about.



"It's the first time I remember when he worked on an invention without
telling me something about it," mused Ned.  "Well, I suppose it will
all come out in good time. Anything new, Rad?"



"No, Massa Ned, nuffin much. I'm detectin' around heah; keepin'
Dutchmen spies away!"



"And Koku is helping you, I suppose?"



"Whut, him?  Dat big, good-fo'-nuffin white trash? No, sah! I's
detectin' by mahse'f, dat's whut I is!" and Eradicate strutted proudly
up and down on his allotted part of the beat, being careful not to
approach the building too closely, for that was Koku's ground.



Ned smiled, and passed on. He found Mr. Swift, secured his subscription
to more bonds, and was about to leave when he heard a call down the
road and saw Tom coming in his small racing car, which had been taken
to the depot by one of the workmen.



"Hello, old man!" cried Ned affectionately, as his chum alighted with a
jump. "Where have you been?"



"Down to Washington. Had a bit of a chat with the President and gave
him some of my views."



"About the war, I suppose?" laughed Ned.



"Yes."



"Did you get your commission?"



"Commission?" And there was a wondering look on Tom's face.



"Yes. Mary Nestor said she thought maybe you were going to Washington
to take an examination for the engineering corps or something like
that. Did you get made an officer?"



"No," answered Tom slowly. "I went to Washington to get exempted."



"Exempted?" Cried Ned, and his voice sounded strained.






Chapter VI



Seeing Things



For a moment Tom Swift looked at his chum. Then something of what was
passing in the mind of the young bond salesman must have been reflected
to Tom, for he said,



"Look here, old man; I know it may seem a bit strange to go to all that
trouble to get exempted from the draft, to which I am eligible, but,
believe me, there's a reason. I can't say anything now, but I'll tell
you as soon as I can&mdash;tell everybody, in fact. Just now it isn't in
shape to talk about."



"Oh, that's all right, Tom," and Ned tried to make his voice sound
natural. "I was just wondering, that's all. I wanted to go to the front
the worst way, but they wouldn't let me. I was sort of hoping you
could, and come back to tell me about it."



"I may yet, Ned."



"You may? Why, I thought&mdash;"



"Oh, I'm only exempted for a time. I've got certain things to do, and I
couldn't do 'em if I enlisted or was drafted.  So I've been excused for
a time. Now I've got a pile of work to do. What are you up to Ned? Same
old story?"



"Liberty Bonds&mdash;yes. Your father just took some more."



"And so will I, Ned. I can do that, anyhow, even if I don't enlist. Put
me down for another two thousand dollars' worth."



"Say, Tom, that's fine! That will make my share bigger than I counted
on. Shopton will beat the record."



"That's good. We ought to pull strong and hearty for our home town.
How's everything else?"



"Oh, so-so. I see Koku and Eradicate trying to outdo one another in
guarding that part of your plant," and Ned nodded toward the big new
building.



"Yes, I had to let Rad play detective. Not that he can do
anything&mdash;he's too old. But it keeps him and Koku from quarreling all
the while. I've got to be pretty careful about that shop. It's got a
secret in it that&mdash;Well, the less said about it the better."



"You're getting my curiosity aroused, Tom," remarked Ned.



"It'll have to go unsatisfied for a while. Wait a bit and I'll give you
a ride. I've got to go over to Sackett on business, and if you're going
that way I'll take you."



"What in?"



"The Hawk."



"That's me!" cried Ned. "I haven't been in an aircraft for some time."



"Tell Miles to run her out," requested Tom. "I've got to go in and say
hello to dad a minute, and then I'll be with you."



"Seems like something was in the wind, Tom&mdash;big doings?" hinted Ned.



"Yes, maybe there is. It all depends on how she turns out."



"You might be speaking of the Hawk or&mdash;Mary Nestor!" said Ned, with a
sidelong look at his chum.



"As it happens, it's neither one," said Tom, and then he hastened away,
to return shortly and guide his fleet little airship, the Hawk, on her
aerial journey.



From then on, at least for some time, neither Tom nor Ned mentioned the
matters they had been discussing&mdash;Tom's failure to enlist, his
exemption, and what was being built in the closely guarded shop.



Tom's business in Sackett did not take him long, and then he and Ned
went for a little ride in the air.



"It's like old times!" exclaimed Ned, his eyes shining, though Tom
could not see them for two reasons. One was that Ned was sitting behind
him, and the other was that Ned wore heavy goggles, as did the young
pilot. Also, they had to carry on their talk through the speaking tube
arrangement.



"Yes, it is a bit like old times," agreed Tom. "We've had some great
old experiences together, Ned, haven't we?"



"We surely have! I wonder if we'll have any more? When we were in the
submarine, and in your big airship. Say, that big one is the one I
always liked! I like big things."



"Do you?" asked Tom. "Well, maybe, when I get&mdash;"



But Tom did not finish, for the Hawk unexpectedly poked her nose into
an empty pocket in the air just then, and needed a firm hand on the
controls. Furthermore, Tom decided against making the confidence that
was on the tip of his tongue.



At last the aircraft was straightened out and the pilot guided her on
toward the army encampment.



"That's the place I'd like to be," called Ned through the tube as the
faint, sweet notes of a bugle floated up from the parade ground.



"Yes, it would be great," admitted Tom. "But there are other things to
do for Uncle Sam besides wearing khaki."



"Tom's up to some game," mused Ned. "I mustn't judge him too hastily,
or I might make a mistake. And Mary mustn't, either. I'll tell her so."



For Mary Nestor had spoken to Ned concerning Tom, and the curiously
secretive air about certain of his activities. And the girl, moreover,
had spoken rather coldly of her friend.  Ned did not like this. It was
not like Mary and Tom to be at odds.



Once more the Hawk came to the ground, this time near the airship sheds
adjoining the Swift works. Just as Tom and Ned alighted, one of the
workmen summoned the young inventor toward the shop, which was so
closely guarded by Koku and Eradicate on the outside.



"I'll have to leave you, Ned," remarked Tom, as he turned away from his
chum. "There's a conference on about a new invention."



"Oh, that's all right. Business is business, you know.  I've got some
bond calls to make myself. I'll see you later."



"Oh, by the way, Ned!" exclaimed Tom, turning back for a moment, "I met
an old friend the other day; or rather an old enemy."



"Hum! When you spoke first, I thought you might mean Professor
Swyington Bumper, that delightful scientist," remarked Ned. "But he
surely was no enemy."



"No; but I meant some one I met about the same time. I met Blakeson,
one of the rival contractors when I helped dig the big tunnel."



"Is that so? Where'd you meet him?"



"Right around here. It was certainly a surprise, and at first I
couldn't place him. Then the memory of his face came back to me," and
Tom related the incident which had taken place the day he and Mr. Damon
were out in the Hawk.



"What's he doing around here?" asked Ned.



"That's more than I can say," Tom answered.



"Up to no good, I'll wager!"



"I agree with you," came from Tom. "But I'm on the watch."



"That's wise, Tom. Well, I'll see you later."



During the week which followed this talk Ned was very busy on Liberty
Bond work, and, he made no doubt, his chum was engaged also. This
prevented them from meeting, but finally Ned, one evening, decided to
walk over to the Swift home.



"I'll pay Tom a bit of a call," he mused. "Maybe he'll feel more like
talking now. Some of the boys are asking why he doesn't enlist, and
maybe if I tell him that he'll make some explanation that will quiet
things down a bit. It's a shame that Tom should be talked about."



With this intention in view, Ned kept on toward his chum's house, and
he was about to turn in through a small grove of trees, which would
lead to a path across the fields, when the young bond salesman was
surprised to hear some one running toward him. He could see no one, for
the path wound in and out among the trees, but the noise was plain.



"Some one in a hurry," mused Ned.



A moment later he caught sight of a small lad named Harry Telford
running toward him. The boy had his hat in his hand, and was speeding
through the fast-gathering darkness as though some one were after him.



"What's the rush?" asked Ned. "Playing cops and robbers?" That was a
game Tom and Ned had enjoyed in their younger days.



"I&mdash;I'm runnin' away!" panted Harry. "I&mdash;I seen something!"



"You saw something?" repeated Ned. "What was it&mdash;a ghost?" and he
laughed, thinking the boy would do the same.



"No, it wasn't no ghost!" declared Harry, casting a look over his
shoulder. "It was a wild elephant that I saw, and it's down in a big
yard with a fence around it."



"Where's that?" asked Ned. "The circus hasn't come to town this
evening, has it?"



"No," answered Harry, "it wasn't no circus. I saw this elephant down in
the big yard back of one of Mr. Swift's factories."



"Oh, down there, was it!" exclaimed Ned. "What was it like?"



"Well, I was walking along the top of the hill," explained Harry, "and
there's one place where, if you climb a tree, you can look right down
in the big fenced-in yard. I guess I'm about the only one that knows
about it."



"I don't believe Tom does," mused Ned, "or he'd have had that tree cut
down. He doesn't want any spying, I take it.  Well, what'd you see?" he
asked Harry aloud.



"Saw an elephant, I tell you!", insisted the younger boy.  "I was in
the tree, looking down, for a lot of us kids has tried to peek through
the fence and couldn't I wanted to see what was there."



"And did you?" asked Ned.



"I sure did! And it scared me, too," admitted Harry. "All at once, when
I was lookin', I saw the big doors at the back of the shed open, and
the elephant waddled out."



"Are you sure you weren't 'seeing things,' like the little boy in the
story?" asked Ned.



"Well, I sure did see something!" insisted Harry. "It was a great big
gray thing, bigger'n any elephant I ever saw in any circus. It didn't
seem to have any tail or trunk, or even legs, but it went slow, just
like an elephant does, and it shook the ground, it stepped so hard!"



"Nonsense!" cried Ned.



"Sure I saw it!" cried Harry. "Anyhow," he added, after a moment's
thought, "it was as big as an elephant, though not like any I ever saw."



"What did it do?" asked Ned.



"Well, it moved around and then it started for the fence nearest me,
where I was up in the tree. I thought it might have seen me, even
though it was gettin' dark, and it might bust through; so I ran!"



"Hum! Well, you surely were seeing things," murmured Ned, but, while he
made light of what the boy told him, the young bank clerk was thinking:
"What is Tom up to now?"






Chapter VII



Up a Tree



"Want to come and have a look?" asked Harry, as Ned paused in the patch
of woods, which were in deeper darkness than the rest of the
countryside, for night was fast falling.



"Have a look at what?" asked Ned, who was thinking many thoughts just
then.



"At the elephant I saw back of the Swift factory. I wouldn't be skeered
if you came along."



"Well, I'm going over to see Tom Swift, anyhow," answered Ned, "so I'll
walk that way. You can come if you like. I don't care about spying on
other people's property&mdash;"



"I wasn't spyin'!" exclaimed Harry quickly. "I just happened to look.
And then I seen something."



"Well, come on," suggested Ned. "If there's anything there, we'll have
a peep at it."



His idea was not to try to see what Tom was evidently endeavoring to
conceal, but it was to observe whence Harry had made his observation,
and be in a position to tell Tom to guard against unexpected lookers-on
from that direction.



During the walk back along the course over which Harry had run so
rapidly a little while before, Ned and the boy talked of what the
latter had seen.



"Do you think it could be some new kind of elephant?" asked Harry. "You
know Tom Swift brought back a big giant from one of his trips, and
maybe he's got a bigger elephant than any one ever saw before."



"Nonsense!" laughed Ned. "In the first place, Tom hasn't been on any
trip, of late, except to Washington, and the only kind of elephants
there are white ones."



"Really?" asked Harry.



"No, that was a joke," explained Ned. "Anyhow, Tom hasn't any giant
elephants concealed up his sleeve, I'm sure of that."



"But what could this be?" asked Harry. "It moved just like some big
animal."



"Probably some piece of machinery Tom was having carted from one shop
to another," went on the young bank clerk.  "Most likely he had it
covered with a big piece of canvas to keep off the dew, and it was that
you saw."



"No, it wasn't!" insisted Harry, but he could not give any further
details of what he had seen so that Ned could recognize it. They kept
on until they reached the hill, at the bottom of which was the Swift
home and the grounds on which the various shops were erected.



"Here's the place where you can look down right into the yard with the
high fence around it," explained Harry, as he indicated the spot.



"I can't see anything."



"You have to climb up the tree," Harry went on. "Here, this is the one,
and he indicated a stunted and gnarled pine, the green branches of
which would effectually screen any one who once got in it a few feet
above the ground.



"Well, I may as well have a look," decided Ned. "It can't do Tom any
harm, and it may be of some service to him. Here goes!"



Up into the tree he scrambled, not without some difficulty, for the
branches were close together and stiff, and Ned tore his coat in the
effort. But he finally got a position where, to his surprise, he could
look down into the very enclosure from which Tom was so particular to
keep prying eyes.



"You can see right down in it!" Ned exclaimed.



"I told you so," returned Harry. "But do you see&mdash;it?"



Ned looked long and carefully. It was lighter, now that they were out
of the clump of woods, and he had the advantage of having the last glow
of the sunset at his back.  Even with that it was difficult to make out
objects on the surface of the enclosed field some hundred or more feet
below.



"Do you see anything?" asked Harry again.



"No, I can't say I do," Ned answered. "The place seems to be deserted."



"Well, there was something there," insisted Harry. "Maybe you aren't
lookin' at the right place."



"Have a look yourself, then," suggested Ned, as he got down, a task no
more to his liking than the climb upward had been.



Harry made easier work of it, being smaller and more used to climbing
trees, a luxury Ned had, perforce, denied himself since going to work
in the bank.



Harry peered about, and then, with a sigh that had in it somewhat of
disappointment, said:



"No; there's nothing there now. But I did see something."



"Are you sure?" asked Ned.



"Positive!" asserted the other.



"Well, whatever it was&mdash;some bit of machinery he was moving, I
fancy&mdash;Tom has taken it in now," remarked Ned.  "Better not say
anything about this, Harry. Tom mightn't like it known."



"No, I won't."



"And don't come here again to look. I know you like to see strange
things, but if you'll wait I'll ask Tom, as soon as it's ready, to let
you have a closer view of whatever it was you saw. Better keep away
from this tree."



"I will," promised the younger lad. "But I'd like to know what it
was&mdash;if it really was a giant elephant  Say! if a fellow had a troop of
them he could have a lot of fun with 'em, couldn't he?"



"How?" asked Ned, hardly conscious of what his companion was saying.



"Why, he could dress 'em up in coats of mail, like the old knights used
to wear, and turn 'em loose against the Germans. Think of a regiment of
elephants, wearin' armor plates like a battleship, carryin' on their
backs a lot of soldiers with machine guns and chargin' against Fritz!
Cracky, that would be a sight!"



"I should say so!" agreed Ned, with a laugh. "There's nothing the
matter with your imagination, Harry, my boy!"



"And maybe that's what Tom's doin'!"



"What do you mean?"



"I mean maybe he is trainin' elephants to fight in the war. You know he
made an aerial warship, so why couldn't he have a lot of armor plated
elephants?"



"Oh, I suppose he could if he wanted to," admitted Ned.  "But I guess
he isn't doing that. Don't get to going too fast in high speed, Harry,
or you may have nightmare. Well, I'm going down to see Tom."



"And you won't tell him I was peekin'?"



"Not if you don't do it again. I'll advise him to have that tree cut
down, though. It's too good a vantage spot."



Harry turned and went in the direction of his home, while Ned kept on
down the hill toward the house of his chum. The young bond salesman was
thinking of many things as he tramped, along, and among them was the
information Harry had just given.



But Ned did not pay a visit to his chum that evening. When he reached
the house he found that Tom had gone out, leaving no word as to when he
would be back.



"Oh, well, I can tell him to-morrow," thought Ned.



It was not, however, until two days later that Ned found the time to
visit Tom again. On this occasion, as before, he took the road through
the clump of woods where he had seen Harry running.



"And while I'm about it," mused Ned, "I may as well go on to the place
where the tree stands and make sure, by daylight, what I only partially
surmised in the evening&mdash;that Tom's place can be looked down on from
that vantage point."



Sauntering slowly along, for he was in no special hurry, having the
remainder of the day to himself, Ned approached the hill where the tree
stood from which Harry had said he had seen what he took to be a giant
elephant, perhaps in armor.



"It's a good clear day," observed Ned, "and fine for seeing. I wonder
if I'll be able to see anything."



It was necessary first to ascend the hill to a point where it overhung,
in a measure, the Swift property, though the holdings of Tom and his
father were some distance beyond the eminence. The tree from which Ned
and Harry had made their observations was on a knob of the hill, the
stunted pine standing out from among others like it.



"Well, here goes for another torn coat," grimly observed Ned, as he
prepared to climb. "But I'll be more careful.  First, though, let's see
if I can see anything without getting up."



He paused a little way from the pine, and peered down the hill. Nothing
could be seen of the big enclosed field back of the building about
which Tom was so careful.



"You have to be up to see anything," mused Ned. "It's up a tree for me!
Well, here goes!"



As Ned started to work his way up among the thick, green branches, he
became aware, suddenly and somewhat to his surprise, that he was not
the only person who knew about the observation spot. For Ned saw, a
yard above his head, as he started to climb, two feet, encased in
well-made boots, standing on a limb near the trunk of the tree.



"Oh, ho!" mused Ned. "Some one here before me! Where there are feet
there must be legs, and where there are legs, most likely a body. And
it isn't Harry, either! The feet are too big for that. I wonder&mdash;"



But Ned's musings were suddenly cut short, for the person up the tree
ahead of him moved quickly and stepped on Ned's fingers, with no light
tread.



"Ouch!" exclaimed the young bank clerk involuntarily, and, letting go
his hold of the limb, he dropped to the ground, while there came a
startled exclamation from the screen of pine branches above him.






Chapter VIII



Detective Rad



"Who's there?" came the demand from the unseen person in the tree.



"I might ask you the same thing," was Ned's sharp retort, as he nursed
his skinned and bruised fingers. "What are you doing up there?"



There was no answer, but a sound among the branches indicated that the
person up the tree was coming down. In another moment a man leaped to
the ground lightly and stood beside Ned. The lad observed that the
stranger was clean shaven, except for a small moustache which curled up
at the ends slightly.



"For all the world like a small edition of the Kaiser's," Ned described
it afterward.



"What are you doing here?" demanded the man, and his voice had in it
the ring of authority. It was this very quality that made Ned bristle
up and "get on his ear," as he said later. The young clerk did not
object to being spoken to authoritatively by those who had the right,
but from a stranger it was different.



"I might ask you the same thing," retorted Ned. "I have as much right
here as you, I fancy, and I can climb trees, too, but I don't care to
have my fingers stepped on," and he looked at the scarified members of
his left hand.



"I beg your pardon. I'm sorry if I hurt you. I didn't mean to. And of
course this is a public place, in a way, and you have a right here. I
was just climbing the tree to&mdash;er&mdash;to get a fishing pole!"



Ned had all he could do to keep from laughing. The idea of getting a
fishing pole from a gnarled and stunted pine struck him as being
altogether novel and absurd. Yet it was not time to make fun of the
man. The latter looked too serious for that.



"Rather a good view to be had from up where you were, eh?" asked Ned
suggestively.



"A good view?" exclaimed the other. "I don't know what you mean!"



"Oh, then you didn't see anything," Ned went on. "Perhaps it's just as
well. Are you fond of fishing?"



"Very. I have&mdash;But I forget, I do not know you nor you me.  Allow me to
introduce myself. I am Mr. Walter Simpson, and I am here on a visit I
just happened to walk out this way, and, seeing a small stream, thought
I should like to fish. I usually carry lines and hooks, and all I
needed was the pole. I was looking for it when I heard you, and&mdash;"



"I felt you!" interrupted Ned, with a short laugh. He told his own
name, but that was all, and seemed about to pass on.



"Are there any locomotive shops around here?" asked Mr. Simpson.



"Locomotive shops?" queried Ned. "None that I know of.  Why?"



"Well, I heard heavy machinery being used down there;" and he waved his
hand toward Tom's shops, "and I thought&mdash;"



"Oh, you mean Shopton!" exclaimed Ned. "That's the Swift plant. No,
they don't make locomotives, though they could if they wanted to, for
they turn out airships, submarines, tunnel diggers, and I don't know
what."



"Do they make munitions there&mdash;for the Allies?" asked Mr. Simpson, and
there was an eager look on his face.



"No, I don't believe so," Ned answered; "though, in fact, I don't know
enough of the place to be in a position to give you any information
about it," he told the man, not deeming it wise to go into particulars.



Perhaps the man felt this, as he did not press for an answer.



The two stood looking at one another for some little time, and then the
man, with a bow that had in it something of insolence, as well as
politeness, turned and went down the path up which Ned had come.



The young bank clerk waited a little while, and then turned his
attention to the tree which seemed to have suddenly assumed an
importance altogether out of proportion to its size.



"Well, since I'm here I'll have a look up that tree," decided Ned.



Favoring his bruised hand, Ned essayed the ascent of the tree more
successfully this time. As he rose up among the branches he found he
could look down directly into the yard with the high fence about it. He
Could see only a portion, good as his vantage point was, and that
portion had in it a few workmen&mdash;nothing else.



"No elephants there," said Ned, with a smile, as he remembered Harry's
excitement. "Still it's just as well for Tom to know that his place can
be looked down on. I'll go and tell him."



As Ned descended the tree he caught a glimpse, off to one side among
some bushes, of something moving.



"I wonder if that's my Simp friend, playing I spy?" mused Ned. "Guess
I'd better have a look."



He worked his way carefully close to the spot where he had seen the
movement. Proceeding then with more caution, watching each step and
parting the bushes with a careful hand, Ned beheld what he expected.



There was the late occupant of the pine tree the man who had stepped on
Ned's fingers, applying a small telescope to his eye and gazing in the
direction of Tom Swift's home.



The man stood concealed in a screen of bushes with his back toward Ned,
and seemed oblivious to his surroundings.  He moved the glass to and
fro, and seemed eagerly intent on discovering something.



"Though what he can see of Tom's place from there isn't much," mused
Ned. "I've tried it myself, and I know; you have to be on an elevation
to look down.  Still it shows he's after something, all right. Guess
I'll throw a little scare into him."



As yet, Ned believed himself unobserved, and that his presence was not
suspected was proved a moment later when he shouted:



"Hey! What are you doing there?"



He had his eye on the partially concealed man, and the latter, as Ned
said afterward, jumped fully two feet in the air, dropping his
telescope as he did so, and turning to face the lad.



"Oh, it's you, is it?" he faltered.



"No one else;" and Ned grinned. "Looking for a good place to fish, I
presume?"



Then, at least for once, the man's suave manner dropped from him as if
it had been a mask. He bared his teeth in a snarl as he answered:



"Mind your own business!"



"Something I'd advise you also to do," replied Ned smoothly. "You can't
see anything from there," he went on.  "Better go back to the tree
and&mdash;cut a fishing pole!"



With this parting shot Ned sauntered down the hill, and swung around to
make his way toward Tom's home. He paid no further attention to the
man, save to determine, by listening, that the fellow was searching
among the bushes for the dropped telescope.



The young inventor was at home, taking a hasty lunch which Mrs. Baggert
had set out for him, the while he poured over some blueprint drawings
that, to Ned's unaccustomed eyes, looked like the mazes of some
intricate puzzle.



"Well, where have you been keeping yourself, old man?" asked Tom Swift,
after he had greeted his friend.



"I might ask the same of you," retorted Ned, with a smile.  "I've been
trying to find you to give you some important information, and I made
up my mind, after what happened to-day, to write it and leave it for
you if I didn't see you."



"What happened to-day?" asked Tom, and there was a serious look on his
face.



"You are being spied upon&mdash;at least, that part of your works enclosed
in the new fence is," replied Ned.



"You don't mean it!" Cried Tom. "This accounts for some of it, then."



"For some of what?" asked Ned.



"For some of the actions of that Blakeson. He's been hanging around
here, I understand, asking too many questions about things that I'm
trying to keep secret&mdash;even from my best friends," and as Tom said this
Ned fancied there was a note of regret in his voice.



"Yes, you are keeping some things secret, Tom," said Ned, determined
"to take the bull by the horns," as it were.



"I'm sorry, but it has to be," went on Tom. "In a little while&mdash;"



"Oh, don't think that I'm at all anxious to know things!" broke in Ned.
"I was thinking of some one else, Tom&mdash;another of your friends."



"Do you mean Mary?"



Ned nodded.



"She feels rather keenly your lack of explanations," went on the young
bank clerk. "If you could only give her a hint&mdash;"



"I'm sorry, but it can't be done," and Tom spoke firmly.  "But you
haven't told me all that happened. You say I am being spied upon."



"Yes," and Ned related what had taken place in the tree.



"Whew!" whistled Tom. "That's going some with a vengeance!  I must have
that tree down in a jiffy. I didn't imagine there was a spot where the
yard could be overlooked. But I evidently skipped that tree.
Fortunately it's on land owned by a concern with which I have some
connection, and I can have it chopped down without any trouble. Much
obliged to you, Ned. I shan't forget this in a hurry. I'll go right
away and&mdash;"



Tom's further remark was interrupted by the hurried entrance of
Eradicate Sampson. The old man was smiling in pleased anticipation,
evidently, at the same time, trying hard not to give way to too much
emotion.



"I's done it, Massa Tom!" he cried exultingly.



"Done what?" asked the young inventor. "I hope you and Koku haven't had
another row."



"No, sah! I don't want nuffin t' do wif dat ornery, low-down white
trash! But I's gone an' done whut I said I'd do!"



"What's that, Rad? Come on, tell us! Don't keep us in suspense."



"I's done some deteckertiff wuk, lest laik I said I'd do, an' I's
cotched him! By golly, Massa Tom! I's cotched him black-handed, as it
says!"



"Caught him? Whom have you caught, Rad?" cried Tom. "Do you suppose he
means he's caught the man you saw up the tree, Ned? The man you think
is a German spy?"



"It couldn't be. I left him only a little while ago hunting for his
telescope."



"Then whom have you caught, Rad?" cried Tom. "Come on, I'll give you
credit for it. Tell us!"



"I's cotched dat Dutch Sauerkrauter, dat's who I's cotched, Massa Tom!
By golly, I's cotched him!"



"But who, Rad? Who is he?"



"I don't know his name, Massa Tom, but he's a Sauerkrauter, all right.
Dat's whut he eats for lunch, an' dat's why I calls him dat. I's
cotched him, an' he's locked up in de stable wif mah mule Boomerang.
An' ef he tries t' git out Boomerang'll jest natchully kick him into
little pieces&mdash;dat's whut Boomerang will do, by golly!"






Chapter IX



A Night Test



"Come on, Ned," said Tom, after a moment or two of silent contemplation
of Eradicate. "I don't know what this cheerful camouflager of mine is
talking about, but we'll have to go to see, I suppose. You say you have
shut some one up in Boomerang's stable, Rad?"



"Yes, sah, Massa Tom, dat's whut I's gone an done."



"And you say he's a German?"



"I don't know as to dat, Massa Tom, but he suah done eat sauerkraut
'mostest ebery meal. Dat's whut I call him&mdash;a Sauerkrauter! An' he suah
was spyin'."



"How do you know that, Rad?"



"'Cause he done went from his own shop on annuder man's ticket into de
secret shop, dat's whut he went an' done!"



"Do you mean to tell me, Rad," went on Tom, "that one of the workmen
from another shop entered Number Thirteen on the pass issued in the
name of one of the men regularly employed in my new shop?"



"Dat's whut he done, Massa Tom."



"How do you know?"



"'Cause I detected him doin' it. Yo'-all done made me a deteckertiff,
an' I detected."



"Go on, Rad."



"Well, sah, Massa Tom, I seen dish yeah Dutchman git a ticket-pass
offen one ob de reg'lar men. Den he went in de unlucky place an' stayed
fo' a long time. When he come out I jest natchully nabbed him, dat's
whut I done, an' I took him to Boomerang's stable."



"How'd you get him to go with you?" asked Ned, for the old colored man
was feeble, and most of the men employed at Tom's plant were of a
robust type.



"I done fooled him. I said as how I'd jest brought from town in mah
mule cart some new sauerkraut, an' he could sample it if he liked. So
he went wif me, an' when I got him to de stable I pushed him in and
locked de door!"



"Come on!" cried Tom to his chum. "Rad may be right, after all, and one
of my workmen may be a German spy, though I've tried to weed them all
out.



"However, no matter about that, if he was employed in another shop, he
had no right to go into Number Thirteen.  That's a violation of rules.
But if he's in Rad's ramshackle stable he can easily get out."



"No, sah, dat's whut he can't do!" insisted the colored man.



"Why not?" asked Tom.



"'Cause Boomerang's on guard, an' yo'-all knows how dat mule of mine
can use his heels!"



"I know, Rad," went on Tom; "but this fellow will find a way of keeping
out of their way. We must hurry."



"Oh, he's safe enough," declared the colored man. "I done tole Koku to
stan' guard, too! Dat low-down white trash ob a giant is all right fo'
guardin', but he ain't wuff shucks at detectin'!" said Eradicate, with
pardonable pride. "By golly, maybe I's too old t' put on guard, but I
kin detect, all right!"



"If this proves true, I'll begin to believe you can," replied Tom. "Hop
along, Ned!"



Followed by the shuffling and chuckling negro, Tom and Ned went to the
rather insecure stable where the mule Boomerang was kept. That is, the
stable was insecure from the standpoint of a jail. But the sight of the
giant Koku marching up and down in front of the place, armed with a big
club, reassured Tom.



"Is he in there, Koku?" asked the young inventor.



"Yes, Master! He try once come out, but he approach his head very close
my defense weapon and he go back again."



"I should think he would," laughed Ned, as he noted the giant's club.



"Well, Rad, let's have a look at your prisoner. Open the door, Koku,"
commanded Tom.



"Better look out," advised Ned. "He may be armed."



"We'll have to take a chance. Besides, I don't believe he is, or he'd
have fired at Koku. There isn't much to fear with the giant ready for
emergencies. Now we'll see who he is. I can't imagine one of my men
turning traitor."



The door was opened and a rather miserable-looking man shuffled out.
There was a bloody rag on his head, and he seemed to have made more of
an effort to escape than Koku described, for he appeared to have
suffered in the ensuing fight.



"Carl Schwen!" exclaimed Tom. "So it was you, was it?"



The German, for such he was, did not answer for a moment. He appeared
downcast, and as if suffering. Then a change came over him. He
straightened up, saluted as a soldier might have done, and a sneering
look came into his face. It was succeeded by one of pride as the man
exclaimed:



"Yes, it is I! And I tried to do what I tried to do for the Fatherland!
I have failed. Now you will have me shot as a spy, I suppose!" he added
bitterly.



Tom did not answer directly. He looked keenly at the man, and at last
said:



"I am sorry to see this. I knew you were a German, Schwen, but I kept
you employed at work that could not, by any possibility, be considered
as used against your country. You are a good machinist, and I needed
you. But if what I hear about you is true, it is the end."



"It is the end," said the man simply. "I tried and failed.  If it had
not been for Eradicate&mdash;Well, he's smarter than I gave him credit for,
that's all!"



The man spoke very good English, with hardly a trace of German accent,
but there was no doubt as to his character.



"What will you do with him, Tom?" asked Ned.



"I don't know. I'll have to do a little investigating first. But he
must be locked up. Schwen," went on the young inventor, "I'm sorry
about this, but I shall have to give you into the custody of a United
States marshal. You are not a naturalized citizen, are you?"



The man muttered something in German to the effect that he was not
naturalized and was glad of it.



"Then you come under the head of an enemy alien," decided Tom, who
understood what was said, "and will have to be interned. I had hoped to
avoid this, but it seems it cannot be. I am sorry to lose you, but
there are more important matters. Now let's get at the bottom of this."



Schwen was, after a little delay, taken in charge by the proper
officer, and then a search was made of his room, for, in common with
some of the other workmen, he lived in a boarding house not far from
the plant.



There, by a perusal of his papers, enough was revealed to show Tom the
danger he had escaped.



"And yet I don't know that I have altogether escaped it," he said to
Ned, as they talked it over. "There's no telling how long this spy work
may have been going on. If he has discovered all the secrets of Shop
Thirteen it may be a bad thing for the Allies and&mdash;"



"Look out!" warned Ned, with a laugh. "You'll be saying things you
don't want to, Tom and not at all in keeping with your former silence."



"That's so," agreed the young inventor, with a sigh. "But if things go
right I'll not have to keep silent much longer.  I may be able to tell
you everything."



"Don't tell me&mdash;tell Mary," advised his chum. "She feels your silence
more than I do. I know how such things are."



"Well, I'll be able to tell her, too," decided Tom. "That is, if Schwen
hasn't spoiled everything. Look here, Ned, these papers show he's been
in correspondence with Blakeson and Grinder."



"What about, Tom?"



"I can't tell. The letters are evidently written in code, and I can't
translate it offhand. But I'll make another attempt at it. And here's
one from a person who signs himself Walter Simpson, but the writing is
in German."



"Walter Simpson!" cried Ned. "That's my friend of the tree!"



"It is?" cried Tom. "Then things begin to fit themselves together.
Simpson is a spy, and he was probably trying to communicate with
Schwen. But the latter didn't get the information he wanted, or, if he
did get it, he wasn't able to pass it on to the man in the tree.
Eradicate nipped him just in time."



And, so it seemed, the colored man had done. By accident he had
discovered that Schwen had prevailed on one of the workmen in Shop 13
to change passes with him. This enabled the German spy to gain
admittance to the secret place, which Tom thought was so well guarded.
The man who let Schwen take the pass was in the game, too, it appeared,
and he was also placed under arrest. But he was a mere tool in the pay
of the others, and had no chance to gain valuable information.



A hasty search of Shop 13 did not reveal anything missing, and it was
surmised (for Schwen would not talk) that he had not found time to go
about and get all that he was after.



Soon after Schwen's arrest the "Spy Tree," as Tom called it, was cut
down.



"Eradicate certainly did better than I ever expected he would,"
declared Tom. "Well, if all goes well, there won't be so much need for
secrecy after a day or so. We're going to give her a test, and then&mdash;"



"Give who a test?" asked Ned, with a smile.



"You'll soon see," answered Tom, with an answering grin.  "I hereby
invite you and Mr. Damon to come over to Shop Thirteen day after
to-morrow night and then&mdash;Well, you'll see what you'll see."



With this Ned had to be content, and he waited anxiously for the
appointed time to come.



"I surely will be glad when Tom is more like himself," he mused, as he
left his chum. "And I guess Mary will be, too.  I wonder if he's going
to ask her to the exhibition?"



It developed that Tom had done so, a fact which Ned learned on the
morning of the day set for the test.



"Come over about nine o'clock," Tom said to his chum. "I guess it will
be dark enough then."



Meanwhile Schwen and Otto Kuhn, the other man involved, had been locked
up, and all their papers given into the charge of the United States
authorities. A closer guard than ever was kept over No. 13 shop, and
some of the workmen, against whom there was a slight suspicion, were
transferred.



"Well, we'll see what we shall see," mused Ned on the appointed
evening, when a telephone message from Mr. Damon informed the young
bank clerk that the eccentric man was coming to call for him before
going on to the Swift place.






Chapter X



A Runaway Giant



"What do you think it's all about, Mr. Damon?"



"I'm sure I don't know, Ned."



The two were at the home of the young bank clerk, preparing to start
for the Swift place, it being nearly nine o'clock on the evening named
by the youthful inventor.



"Bless my hat-rack!" went on the eccentric man, "but Tom isn't at all
like himself of late. He's working on some invention, I know that, but
it's all I do know. He hasn't given me a hint of it."



"Nor me, nor any of his friends," added Ned. "And he acts so oddly
about enlisting&mdash;doesn't want even to speak of it.  How he got exempted
I don't know, but I do know one thing, and that is Tom Swift is for
Uncle Sam first, last and always!"



"Oh, of course!" agreed Mr. Damon. "Well, we'll soon know, I guess.
We'd better start, Ned."



"It's useless to try to guess what it is Tom is up to. He has kept his
secret well. The nearest any one has come to it was when Harry figured
out that Tom had a band of giant elephants which he was fitting with
coats of steel armor to go against the Germans," observed Ned, when he
and Mr. Damon were on their way.



"Well, that mightn't be so bad," agreed Mr. Damon.
"But&mdash;um&mdash;elephants&mdash;and wild giant ones, too!  Bless my circus ticket,
Ned! do you think we'd better go in that case?"



"Oh, Tom hasn't anything like that!" laughed Ned. "That was only
Harry's crazy notion after he saw something big and ungainly careening
about the enclosed yard of Shop Thirteen.  Hello, there go Mary Nestor
and her father!" and Ned pointed to the opposite side of the street
where the girl and Mr. Nestor could be seen in the light of a street
lamp.



"They're going out to see Tom's secret," said Mr. Damon.  "There's
plenty of room in my car. Let's ask them to go with us."



"Surely," agreed Ned, and a moment later he and Mary were in the rear
seat while Mr. Damon and Mr. Nestor were in the front, Mr. Damon at the
wheel, and they were soon speeding down the road.



"I do hope everything will go all right," observed Mary.



"What do you mean?" asked Ned.



"I mean Tom is a little bit anxious about this test."



"Did he tell you what it was to be?"



"No; but when he called to invite father and me to be present he seemed
worried. I guess it's a big thing, for he never has acted this way
before&mdash;not talking about his work."



"That's right," assented Ned. "But the secret will soon be disclosed, I
fancy. But how is it you aren't going to the dance with Lieutenant
Martin? He told me you had half accepted for to-night."



"I had." And if it had been light enough Ned would have seen Mary
blushing. "I was going with him. It's a dance for the benefit of the
Red Cross to get money for comfort kits for the soldiers. But when Tom
sent word that he'd like to have me present to-night, why&mdash;"



"Oh, I see!" broke in Ned, with a little laugh. "'Nough said!"



Mary's blushes were deeper, but the kindly night hid them.



Then they conversed on matters connected with the big war&mdash;the selling
of Liberty Bonds, the Red Cross work and the Surgical Dressings
Committee, in which Mary was the head of a junior league.



"Everybody in Shopton seems to be doing something to help win the war,"
said Mary, and as there was just then a lull in the talk between her
father and Mr. Damon her words sounded clearly.



"Yes, everybody&mdash;that is, all but a few," said Mr. Nestor, "and they
ought to get busy. There are some young fellows in this town that ought
to be wearing khaki, and I don't mean you, Ned Newton. You're doing
your bit, all right."



"And so is Tom Swift!" exclaimed Mr. Damon, as if there had been an
implied accusation against the young inventor.  "I heard, only to-day,
that one of his inventions&mdash;a gas helmet that he planned&mdash;is in use on
the Western front in Europe. Tom gave his patents to the government,
and even made a lot of the helmets free to show other factories how to
turn them out to advantage."



"He did?" cried Mr. Nestor.



"That's what he did.  Talk about doing your bit&mdash;"



"I didn't know that," observed Mary's father slowly. "Do you suppose
it's a test of another gas helmet that Tom has asked us out to see
to-night?"



"I hardly think so," said Ned. "He wouldn't wait until after dark for
that. This is something big, and Tom must intend to have it out in the
open. He probably waited until after sunset so the neighbors wouldn't
come out in flocks.  There's been a lot of talk about what is going on
in Shop Thirteen, especially since the arrest of the German spies, and
the least hint that a test is under way would bring out a big crowd."



"I suppose so," agreed Mr. Nestor. "Well, I'm glad to know that Tom is
doing something for Uncle Sam, even if it's only helping with gas
helmets. Those Germans are barbarians, if ever there were any, and
we've got to fight them the same way they fight us! That's the only way
to end the war!  Now if I had my way, I'd take every German I could lay
my hands on&mdash;"



"Father, pretzels!" exclaimed Mary.



"Eh? What's that, my dear?"



"I said pretzels!"



"Oh!" and Mr. Nestor's voice lost its sharpness.



"That's my way of quieting father down when he gets too strenuous in
his talk about the war," explained Mary. "We agreed that whenever he
got excited I was to say 'pretzels' to him, and that would make him
remember. We made up our little scheme after he got into an argument
with a man on the train and was carried past his station."



"That's right," admitted Mr. Nestor, with a laugh. "But that fellow was
the most obstinate, pig-headed Dutchman that ever tackled a plate of
pig's knuckles and sauerkraut, and if he had the least grain of common
sense he'd&mdash;"



"Pretzels!" cried Mary.



"Eh? Oh, yes, my dear. I was forgetting again."



There was a moment of merriment, and then, after the talk had run for a
while in other and safer channels, Mr. Damon made the announcement:



"I think we're about there. We'll be at Tom's place when we make the
turn and&mdash;"



He was interrupted by a low, heavy rumbling.



"What's that?" asked Mr. Nestor.



"It's getting louder&mdash;the noise," remarked Mary. "It sounds as if some
big body were approaching down the road&mdash;the tramp of many feet. Can it
be that troops are marching away?"



"Bless my spark plug!" suddenly cried Mr. Damon. "Look!"



They gazed ahead, and there, seen in the glare of the automobile
headlights, was an immense, dark body approaching them from across a
level field. The rumble and roar became more pronounced and the ground
shook as though from an earthquake.



A glaring light shone out from the ponderous moving body, and above the
roar and rattle a voice called:



"Out out of the way! We've lost control! Look out!"



"Bless my steering wheel!" gasped Mr. Damon, "that was Tom Swift's
voice! But what is he doing in that&mdash;thing?"



"It must be his new invention!" exclaimed Ned.



"What is it?" asked Mr. Nestor.



"A giant," ventured Ned. "It's a giant machine of some sort and&mdash;"



"And it's running away!" cried Mr. Damon, as he quickly steered his car
to one side&mdash;and not a moment too soon! An instant later in a cloud of
dust, and with a rumble and a roar as of a dozen express trains fused
into one, the runaway giant&mdash;of what nature they could only
guess&mdash;flashed and lumbered by, Tom Swift leaning from an opening in
the thick steel side, and shouting something to his friends.






Chapter XI



Tom's Tank



"What was it?" gasped Mary, and, to her surprise, she found herself
close to Ned, clutching his arm.



"I have an idea, but I'd rather let Tom tell you," he answered.



"But where's it going?" asked Mr. Nestor. "What in the world does Tom
Swift mean by inviting us out here to witness a test, and then nearly
running us down under a Juggernaut?"



"Oh, there must be some mistake, I'm sure," returned his daughter. "Tom
didn't intend this."



"But, bless my insurance policy, look at that thing go!  What in the
world is it?" cried Mr. Damon.



The "thing" was certainly going. It had careened from the road, tilted
itself down into a ditch and gone on across the fields, lights shooting
from it in eccentric fashion.



"Maybe we'd better take after it," suggested Mr. Nestor.  "If Tom is&mdash;"



"There, it's stopping!" cried Ned. "Come on!"



He sprang from the automobile, helped Mary to get out, and then the
two, followed by Mr. Damon and Mr. Nestor, made their way across the
fields toward the big object where it had come to a stop, the rumbling
and roaring ceasing.



Before the little party reached the strange machine&mdash;the "runaway
giant," as they dubbed it in their excitement&mdash;a bright light flashed
from it, a light that illuminated their path right up to the monster.
And in the glare of this light they saw Tom Swift stepping out through
a steel door in the side of the affair.



"Are you all right?" he called to his friends, as they approached.



"All right, as nearly as we can be when we've been almost scared to
death, Tom," said Mr. Nestor.



"I'm surely sorry for what happened," Tom answered, with a relieved
laugh. "Part of the steering gear broke and I had to guide it by
operating the two motors alternately. It can be worked that way, but it
takes a little practice to become expert."



"I should say so!" cried Mr. Damon. "But what in the world does it all
mean, Tom Swift? You invite us out to see something&mdash;"



"And there she is!" interrupted the young inventor. "You saw her a
little before I meant you to, and not under exactly the circumstances I
had planned. But there she is!" And he turned as though introducing the
metallic monster to his friends.



"What is she, Tom?" asked Ned. "Name it!"



"My latest invention, or rather the invention of my father and myself,"
answered Tom, and his voice showed the love and reverence he felt for
his parent. "Perhaps I should say adaptation instead of invention," Tom
went on, "since that is what it is. But, at any rate, it's my
latest&mdash;dad's and mine&mdash;and it's the newest, biggest, most improved and
powerful fighting tank that's been turned out of any shop, as far as I
can learn.



"Ladies&mdash;I mean lady and gentlemen&mdash;allow me to present to you War Tank
A, and may she rumble till the pride of the Boche is brought low and
humble!" cried Tom.



"Hurray! That's what I say!" cheered Ned.



"That's what I have been at work on lately. I'll give you a little
history of it, and then you may come inside and have a ride home."



"In that?" cried Mr. Damon.



"Yes. I can't promise to move as speedily as your car, but I can make
better time than the British tanks. They go about six miles an hour, I
understand, and I've got mine geared to ten. That's one improvement dad
and I have made."



"Ride in that!" cried Mr. Nestor. "Tom, I like you, and I'm glad to see
I've been mistaken about you. You have been doing your bit, after all;
but&mdash;"



"Oh, I've only begun!" laughed Tom Swift.



"Well, no matter about that. However much I like you," went on Mr.
Nestor, "I'd as soon ride on the wings of a thunderbolt as in Tank A,
Tom Swift."



"Oh, it isn't as bad as that!" laughed the young scientist. "But
neither is it a limousine. However, come inside, anyhow, and I'll tell
you something about it. Then I guess we can guide it back. The men are
repairing the break."



The visitors entered the great craft through the door by which Tom had
emerged. At first all they saw was a small compartment, with walls of
heavy steel, some shelves of the same and a seat which folded up
against the wall made of like powerful material.



"This is supposed to be the captain's room, where he stays when he
directs matters." Tom explained. "The machinery is below and beyond
here."



"How'd you come to evolve this?" asked Ned. "I haven't seen half enough
of the outside, to say nothing of the inside."



"You'll have time enough," Tom said. "This is my first completed tank.
There are some improvements to be made before we send it to the other
side to be copied.



"Then they'll make them in England as well as here, and from here we'll
ship them in sections."



"I don't see how you ever thought of it!" exclaimed the girl, in wonder.



"Well, I didn't all at once," Tom answered, with a laugh.  "It came by
degrees. I first got the idea when I heard of the British tanks.



"When I had read how they went into action and what they accomplished
against the barbed wire entanglements, and how they crossed the
trenches, I concluded that a bigger tank, one capable of more speed,
say ten or twelve miles an hour, and one that could cross bigger
excavations&mdash;the English tanks up to this time can cross a ditch of
twelve feet&mdash;I thought that, with one made on such specifications, more
effective work could be done against the Germans."



"And will yours do that?" asked Ned. "I mean will it do ten miles an
hour, and straddle over a wider ditch than twelve feet?"



"It'll do both," promptly answered Tom. "We did a little better than
eleven miles an hour a while ago when I yelled to you to get out of the
way just now. It's true we weren't under good control, but the speed
had nothing to do with that. And as for going over a big ditch, I think
we straddled one about fourteen feet across back there, and we can do
better when I get my grippers to working."



"Grippers!" exclaimed Mary.



"What kind of trench slang is that, Tom Swift?" asked Mr. Damon.



"Well, that's a new idea I'm going to try out It's something like
this," and while from a distant part of the interior of Tank A came the
sound of hammering, the young inventor rapidly drew a rough pencil
sketch.



It showed the tank in outline, much as appear the pictures of tanks
already in service&mdash;the former simile of two wedge-shaped pieces of
metal put together broad end to broad end, still holding good. From one
end of the tank, as Tom drew it, there extended two long arms of
latticed steel construction.



"The idea is," said Tom, "to lay these down in front of the tank, by
means of cams and levers operated from inside.  If we get to a ditch
which we can't climb down into and out again, or bridge with the belt
caterpillar wheels, we'll use the grippers. They'll be laid down,
taking a grip on the far side of the trench, and we'll slide across on
them."



"And leave them there?" asked Mr. Damon.



"No, we won't leave them. We'll pick them up after we have passed over
them and use them in front again as we need them. A couple of extra
pairs of grippers may be carried for emergencies, but I plan to use the
same ones over and over again."



"But what makes it go?" asked Mary. "I don't want all the details,
Tom," she said, with a smile, "but I'd like to know what makes your
tank move."



"I'll be able to show you in a little while," he answered.  "But it may
be enough now if I tell you that the main power consists of two big
gasolene engines, one on either side.  They can be geared to operate
together or separately. And these engines turn the endless belts made
of broad, steel plates, on which the tank travels. The belts pass along
the outer edges of the tank longitudinally, and go around cogged wheels
at either end of the blunt noses.



"When both belts travel at the same rate of speed the tank goes in a
straight line, though it can be steered from side to side by means of a
trailer wheel in the rear. Making one belt&mdash;one set of caterpillar
wheels, you know&mdash;go faster than the other will make the tank travel to
one side or the other, the turn being in the direction of the slowest
moving belt. In this way we can steer when the trailer wheels are
broken."



"And what does your tank do except travel along, not minding a hail of
bullets?" asked Mr. Nestor.



"Well," answered Tom, "it can do anything any other tank can do, and
then some more. It can demolish a good-sized house or heavy wall, break
down big trees, and chew up barbed-wire fences as if they were
toothpicks. I'll show you all that in due time. Just now, if the
repairs are finished, we can get back on the road&mdash;"



At that moment a door leading into the compartment where Tom and his
friends were talking opened, and one of the workmen said:



"A man outside asking to see you, Mr. Swift."



"Pardon me, but I won't keep you a moment," interrupted a suave voice.
"I happened to observe your tank, and I took the liberty of entering to
see&mdash;"



"Simpson!" cried Ned Newton, as he recognized the man who had been up
the tree. "It's that spy, Simpson, Tom!"






Chapter XII



Bridging a Gap



Such surprise showed both on the face of Ned Newton and that of the man
who called himself Walter Simpson that it would be hard to say which
was in the greater degree. For a moment the newcomer stood as if he had
received all electric shock, and was incapable of motion. Then, as the
echoes of Ned's voice died away and the young bank clerk, being the
first to recover from the shock, made a motion toward the unwelcome and
uninvited intruder, Simpson exclaimed.



"I will not bother now. Some other time will do as well."



Then, with a haste that could be called nothing less than precipitate,
he made a turn and fairly shot out of the door by which he had entered
the tank.



"There he goes!" cried Mr. Damon. "Bless my speedometer, but there he
goes!"



"I'll stop him!" cried Ned. "We've got to find out more about him! I'll
get him, Tom!"



Tom Swift was not one to let a friend rush alone into what might be
danger. He realized immediately what his chum meant when he called out
the identity of the intruder, and, wishing to clear up some of the
mystery of which he became aware when Schwen was arrested and the paper
showing a correspondence with this Simpson were found, Tom darted out
to try to assist in the capture.



"He went this way!" cried Ned, who was visible in the glare of the
searchlight that still played its powerful beams over the stern of the
tank, if such an ungainly machine can be said to have a bow and stern.
"Over this way!"



"I'm with you!" cried Tom. "See if you can pick up that man who just
ran out of here!" he cried to the operator of the searchlight in the
elevated observation section of what corresponded to the conning tower
of a submarine. This was a sort of lookout box on top of the tank,
containing, among other machines, the searchlight. "Pick him up!" cried
Tom.



The operator flashed the intense white beam, like a finger of light,
around in eccentric circles, but though this brought into vivid relief
the configuration of the field and road near which the tank was
stalled, it showed no running fugitive. Tom and Ned were
observed&mdash;shadows of black in the glare&mdash;by Mary and her friends in the
tank, but there was no one else.



"Come on!" cried Ned. "We can find him, Tom!"



But this was easier said than done. Even though they were aided by the
bright light, they caught no glimpse of the man who called himself
Simpson.



"Guess he got away," said Tom, when he and Ned had circled about and
investigated many clumps of bushes, trees, stumps and other barriers
that might conceal the fugitive.



"I guess so," agreed Ned. "Unless he's hiding in what we might call a
shell crater."



"Hardly that," and Tom smiled. "Though if all goes well the men who
operate this tank later may be searching for men in real shell holes."



"Is this one going to the other side?" asked Ned, as the two walked
back toward the tank.



"I hope it will be the first of my new machines on the Western front,"
Tom answered. "But I've still got to perfect it in some details and
then take it apart. After that, if it comes up to expectations, we'll
begin making them in quantities."



"Did you get him?" asked Mr. Damon eagerly, as the two young men came
back to join Mary and her friends.



"No, he got away," Tom answered.



"Did he try to blow up the tank?" asked Mr. Nestor, who had an abnormal
fear of explosives. "Was he a German spy?"



"I think he's that, all right," said Ned grimly. "As to his endeavoring
to blow up Tom's tank, I believe him capable of it, though he didn't
try it to-night&mdash;unless he's planted a time bomb somewhere about, Tom."



"Hardly, I guess," answered the young inventor. "He didn't have a
chance to do that. Anyhow we won't remain here long.  Now, Ned, what
about this chap? Is he really the one you saw up in the tree?"



"I not only saw him but I felt him," answered Ned, with a rueful look
at his fingers. "He stepped right on me. And when he came inside the
tank to-night I knew him at once. I guess he was as surprised to see me
as I was to see him."



"But what was his object?" asked Mr. Nestor.



"He must have some connection with my old enemy, Blakeson," answered
Tom, "and we know he's mixed up with Schwen. From the looks of him I
should say that this Simpson, as he calls himself, is the directing
head of the whole business. He looks to be the moneyed man, and the
brains of the plotters. Blakeson is smart, in a mechanical way, and
Schwen is one of the best machinists I've ever employed. But this
Simpson strikes me as being the slick one of the trio."



"But what made him come here, and what did he want?" asked Mary. "Dear
me! it's like one of those moving picture plots, only I never saw one
with a tank in it before&mdash;I mean a tank like yours, Tom."



"Yes, it is a bit like moving picture&mdash;especially chasing Simpson by
searchlight," agreed the young inventor. "As to what he wanted, I
suppose he came to spy out some of my secret inventions&mdash;dad's and
mine. He's probably been hiding and sneaking around the works ever
since we arrested Schwen.  Some of my men have reported seeing
strangers about, but I have kept Shop Thirteen well guarded.



"However, this fellow may have been waiting outside, and he may have
followed the tank when we started off a little while ago for the night
test. Then, when he saw our mishap and noticed that we were stalled, he
came in, boldly enough, thinking, I suppose, that, as I had never seen
him, he would take a chance on getting as much information as he could
in a hurry."



"But he didn't count on Ned's being here!" chuckled Mr. Damon.



"No; that's where he slipped a cog," remarked Mr. Nestor.  "Well, Tom,
I like your tank, what I've seen of her, but it's getting late and I
think Mary and I had better be getting back home."



"We'll be ready to start in a little while," Tom said, after a brief
consultation with one of his men. "Still, perhaps it would be just as
well if you didn't ride back with me. She may go all right, and then,
again, she may not.  And as it's dark, and we're in a rough part of the
field, you might be a bit shaken up. Not that the tank minds it!" the
young inventor hastened to add "She's got to do her bit over worse
places than this&mdash;much worse&mdash;but I want to get her in a little better
working shape first. So if you don't mind, Mary, I'll postpone your
initial trip."



"Oh, I don't mind, Tom! I'm so glad you've made this! I want to see the
war ended, and I think machines like this will help."



"I'll ride back with you, Tom, if you don't mind," put in Ned. "I guess
a little shaking up won't hurt me."



"All right&mdash;stick. We're going to start very soon."



"Well, I'm coming over to-morrow to have a look at it by daylight,"
said Mr. Damon, as he started toward his car.



"So am I," added Mary. "Please call for me, Mr. Damon."



"I will," he promised.



Mr. Nestor, his daughter, and Mr. Damon went back to the automobile,
while Ned remained with Tom. In a little while those in the car heard
once more the rumbling and roaring sound and felt the earth tremble.
Then, with a flashing of lights, the big, ungainly shape of the tank
lifted herself out of the little ditch in which she had come to a halt,
and began to climb back to the road.



Ned Newton stood beside Tom in the control tower of the great tank as
she started on her homeward way.



"Isn't it wonderful!" murmured Mary, as she saw Tank A lumbering along
toward the road. "Oh, and to think that human beings made that. To think
that Tom should know how to build such a wonderful machine!"



"And run it, too, Mary!  That's the point! Make it run!" cried her
father. "I tell you, that Tom Swift is a wonder!"



"Bless my dictionary, he sure is!" agreed Mr. Damon.



Along the road, back toward the shop whence it had emerged, rumbled the
tank. The noise brought to their doors inhabitants along the country
thoroughfare, and some of them were frightened when they saw Tom
Swift's latest war machine, the details of which they could only guess
at in the darkness.



"She'll butt over a house if it gets in her path, knock down trees,
chew up barbed-wire, and climb down into ravines and out again, and go
over a good-sized stream without a whimper," said Tom, as he steered
the great machine.



There was little chance then for Ned to see much of the inside
mechanism of the tank. He observed that Tom, standing in the forward
tower, steered it very easily by a small wheel or by a lever,
alternately, and that he communicated with the engine room by means of
electric signals.



"And she steers by electricity, too," Tom told his friend.  "That was
one difficulty with the first tanks. They had to be steered by brute
force, so to speak, and it was a terrific strain on the man in the
tower. Now I can guide this in two ways: by the electric mechanism
which swings the trailer wheels to either side, or by varying the speed
of the two motors that work the caterpillar belts. So if one breaks
down, I have the other."



"Got any guns aboard her&mdash;I mean machine guns?" asked Ned.



"Not yet.  But I'm going to install some. I wanted to get the tank in
proper working order first. The guns are only incidental, though of
course they're vitally necessary when she goes into action. I've got
'em all ready to put in. But first I'm going to try the grippers."



"Oh, you mean the gap-bridgers?" asked Ned.



"That's it," answered Tom. "Look out, we're going over a rough spot
now."



And they did. Ned was greatly shaken up, and fairly tossed from side to
side of the steering tower. For the tank contained no springs, except
such as were installed around the most delicate machinery, and it was
like riding in a dump cart over a very rough road.



"However, that's part of the game," Tom observed.



Tank A reached her "harbor" safely&mdash;in other words, the machine shop
enclosed by the high fence, inside of which she had been built.



Tom and Ned made some inquiries of Koku and Eradicate as to whether or
not there had been any unusual sights or sounds about the place. They
feared Simpson might have come to the shop to try to get possession of
important drawings or data.



But all had been quiet, Koku reported. Nor had Eradicate seen or heard
anything out of the ordinary.



"Then I guess we'll lock up and turn in," decided Tom.  "Come over
to-morrow, Ned."



"I will," promised the young bank clerk. "I want to see more of what
makes the wheels go round."  And he laughed at his own ingenuousness.



The next day Tom showed his friends as much as they cared to see about
the workings of the tank. They inspected the powerful gasolene engines,
saw how they worked the endless belts made of plates of jointed steel,
which, running over sprocket wheels, really gave the tank its power by
providing great tractive force.



Any self-propelled vehicle depends for its power, either to move itself
or to push or to pull, on its tractive force&mdash;that is, the grip it can
get on the ground.



In the case of a bicycle little tractive power is needed, and this is
provided by the rubber tires, which grip the ground. A locomotive
depends for its tractive power on its weight pressing on its driving
wheels, and the more driving wheels there are and the heavier the
locomotive, the more it can pull, though in that case speed is lost.
This is why freight locomotives are so heavy and have so many large
driving wheels. They pull the engine along, and the cars also, by their
weight pressing on the rails.



The endless steel belts of a tank are, the same as the wheels of a
locomotive. And the belts, being very broad, which gives them a large
surface with which to press on the ground, and the tank being very
heavy, great power to advance is thus obtained, though at the sacrifice
of speed.  However, Tom Swift had made his tank so that it would do
about ten miles and more an hour, nearly double the progress obtained
up to that time by the British machines.



His visitors saw the great motors, they inspected the compact but not
very attractive living quarters of the crew, for provision had to be
made for the men to stay in the tank if, perchance, it became stalled
in No Man's Land, surrounded by the enemy.



The tank was powerfully armored and would be armed. There were a number
of machine guns to be installed, quick-firers of various types, and in
addition the tank could carry a number of riflemen.



It was upon the crushing power of the tank, though, that most reliance
was placed. Thus it could lead the way for an infantry advance through
the enemy's lines, making nothing of barbed wire that would take an
artillery fire of several days to cut to pieces.



"And now, Ned," said Tom, about a week after the night test of the
tank, "I'm going to try what she'll do in bridging a gap."



"Have you got her in shape again?"



"Yes, everything is all right. I've taken out the weak part in the
steering gear that nearly caused us to run you down, and we're safe in
that respect now. And I've got the grippers made. It only remains to
see whether they're strong enough to bear the weight of my little
baby," and Tom affectionately patted the steel sides of Tank A.



While his men were getting the machine ready for a test out on the
road, and for a journey across a small stream not far away, Tom told
his chum about conceiving the idea for the tank and carrying it out
secretly with the aid of his father and certain workmen.



"That's the reason the government exempted me from enlisting," Tom
said. "They wanted me to finish this tank. I didn't exactly want to,
but I considered it my 'bit.' After this I'm going into the army, Ned."



"Glad to hear it, old man. Maybe by that time I'll have this Liberty
Bond work finished, and I'll go with you. We'll have great times
together! Have you heard anything more of Simpson, Blakeson and
Scoundrels?" And Ned laughed as he named this "firm."



"No," answered Tom. "I guess we scared off that slick German spy."



Once more the tank lumbered out along the road. It was a mighty engine
of war, and inside her rode Tom and Ned. Mary and her father had been
invited, but the girl could not quite get her courage to the point of
accepting, nor did Mr. Nestor care to go. Mr. Damon, however, as might
be guessed, was there.



"Bless my monkey wrench, Tom!" cried the eccentric man, as he noted
their advance over some rough ground, "are you really going to make
this machine cross Tinkle Creek on a bridge of steel you carry with
you?"



"I'm going to try, Mr. Damon."



A little later, after a successful test up and down a small gully, Tank
A arrived at the edge of Tinkle Creek, a small stream about twenty feet
wide, not far from Tom's home. At the point selected for the test the
banks were high and steep.



"If she bridges that gap she'll do anything," murmured Ned, as the tank
came to a stop on the edge.






Chapter XIII



Into a Trench



Tom cast a hasty glance over the mechanism of the machine before he
started to cross the stream by the additional aid of the grippers, or
spanners, as he sometimes called this latest device.



Along each side, in a row of sockets, were two long girders of steel,
latticed like the main supports of a bridge. They were of peculiar
triangular construction, designed to support heavy weights, and each
end was broadly flanged to prevent its sinking too deeply into the
earth on either side of a gully or a stream.



The grippers also had a sort of clawlike arrangement on either end,
working on the principle of an "orange-peel" shovel, and these claws
were designed to grip the earth to prevent slipping.



The spanners would be pulled out from their sockets on the side of the
tank by means of steel cables, which were operated from within. They
would be run out across the gap and fastened in place. The tank was
designed to travel along them to the other side of the gap, and, once
there, to pick up the girders, slip them back into place on the sides,
and the engine of war would travel on.



"You are mightily excited, Tom.



"I admit it, Ned. You see, I have not tried the grippers out except on
a small model. They worked there, but whether they will work in
practice remains to be seen. Of course, at this stage, I'm willing to
stake my all on the results, but there is always a half-question until
the final try-out under practical conditions."



"Well, we'll soon see," said one of the workmen. "Are you ready, Mr.
Swift?"



"All ready," answered Tom.



Tank A, as she was officially known, had come to a stop, as has been
said, on the very edge of Tinkle Creek. The banks were fairly solid
here, and descended precipitously to the water ten feet below. The
shores were about twenty feet apart.



"Suppose the spanners break when you're halfway over, Tom?" asked his
chum.



"I don't like to suppose anything of the sort. But if they do, we're
going down!"



"Can you get up again?"



"That remains to be seen," was the non-committal reply.  "Well, here
goes, anyhow!"



Going up into the observation tower, which was only slightly raised
above the roof of the highest part of the tank, Tom gave the signal for
the motors to start. There was a trembling throughout the whole of the
vast structure. Tom threw back a lever and Ned, peering from a side
observation slot, beheld a strange sight.



Like the main arm of some great steam shovel, two long, latticed
girders of steel shot out from the sides of the tank. They gave a half
turn, as they were pulled forward by the steel ropes, so that they lay
with their broader surfaces uppermost.



Straight across the stream they were pulled, their clawlike ends coming
to a rest on the opposite bank. Then they were tightened into place by
a backward pull on the operating cables, and Tom, with a sigh of
relief, announced:



"Well, so far so good!"



"Do we go over now?" inquired Ned.



"Over the top&mdash;yes, I hope," answered Tom, with a laugh.  "How about
you down there?" he called to the engine room through a telephone which
could only be used when the machinery was not in action, there being
too much noise to permit the use of any but visual signals after that.



"All right," came back the answer. "We're ready when you are."



"Then here we go!" said Tom. "Hold fast, Ned! Of course there's no real
telling what will happen, though I believe we'll come out of it alive."



"Cheerful prospect," murmured Ned.



The grippers were now in place. It only remained for the tank to propel
herself over them, pick them up on the other side of Tinkle Creek, and
proceed on her course.



Tom Swift hesitated a moment, one hand on the starting lever and the
other on the steering wheel. Then, with a glance at Ned, half whimsical
and half resolute, Tom started Tank A on what might prove to be her
last journey.



Slowly the ponderous caterpillar belts moved around on the sprocket
wheels. They ground with a clash of steel on the surface of the
spanners. So long was the tank that the forward end, or the "nose," was
halfway across the stream before the bottom part of the endless belts
gripped the latticed bridge.



"If we fall, we'll span the creek, not fall into it," murmured Ned, as
he looked from the observation slot.



"That's what I counted on," Tom said. "We'll get out, even if we do
fall."



But Tank A was not destined to fall. In another moment her entire
weight rested on the novel and transportable bridge Tom Swift had
evolved. Then, as the gripping ends of the girders sank farther into
the soil, the tank went on her way.



Slowly, at half speed, she crawled over the steel beams, making
progress over the creek and as safely above the water as though on a
regularly constructed bridge.



On and on she went. Now her entire weight was over the middle of the
temporary structures. If they were going to give way at all, it would
be at this point. But they did not give. The latticed and triangular
steel, than which there is no stronger form of construction, held up
the immense weight of Tank A, and on this novel bridge she propelled
herself across Tinkle Creek.



"Well, the worst is over," remarked Ned, as he saw the nose of the tank
project beyond the farthermost bank.



"Yes, even if they collapse now nothing much can happen," Tom answered.
"It won't be any worse than wallowing down into a trench and out again.
But I think the spanners will hold."



And hold they did! They held, giving way not a fraction of an inch,
until the tank was safely across, and then, after a little delay, due
to a jamming of one of the recovery cables, the spanners were picked
up, slid into the receiving sockets, and the great war engine was ready
to proceed again.



"Hurrah!" cried Ned. "She did it, Tom, old man!" and he clapped his
chum resoundingly on the back.



"She certainly did!" was the answer. "But you needn't knock me apart
telling me that. Go easy!"



"Bless my apple pie!" cried Mr. Damon, who was as much pleased as
either of the boys, "this is what I call great!"



"Yes, she did all that I could have hoped for," said Tom.  "Now for the
next test."



"Bless my collar button! is there another?"



"Just down into a trench and out again." Tom said. "This is
comparatively simple. It's only what she'll have to do every day in
Flanders."



The tank waddled on. A duck's sidewise walk is about the only kind of
motion that can be compared to it. The going was easier now, for it was
across a big field, and Tom told his friends that at the other end was
a deep, steep and rocky ravine in which he had decided to give the tank
another test.



"We'll imagine that ravine is a trench," he said, "and that we've got
to get on the other side of it. Of course, we won't be under fire, as
the tanks will be at the front, but aside from that the test will be
just as severe."



A little later Tank A brought her occupants to the edge of the "trench."



"Now, little girl," cried Tom exultingly, patting the rough steel side
of his tank, "show them what you can do!"



"Bless my plum pudding!" cried Mr. Damon, "are you really going down
there, Tom Swift?"



"I am," answered the young inventor. "It won't be dangerous. We'll
crawl down and crawl out. Hold fast!"



He steered the machine straight for the edge of the ravine, and as the
nose slipped over and the broad steel belts bit into the earth the tank
tilted downward at a sickening angle.



She appeared to be making the descent safely, when there was a sudden
change. The earth seemed to slip out from under the broad caterpillar
belts, and then the tank moved more rapidly.



"Tom, we're turning over!" shouted Ned. "We're capsizing!"






Chapter XIV



The Ruined Factory



Only too true were the words Ned Newton shouted to his chum. Tank A was
really capsizing. She had advanced to the edge of the gully and started
down it, moving slowly on the caterpillar bands of steel. Then had come
a sudden lurch, caused, as they learned afterward, by the slipping off
of a great quantity of shale from an underlying shelf of rock.



This made unstable footing for the tank. One side sank lower than the
other, and before Tom could neutralize this by speeding up one motor
and slowing down the other the tank slowly turned over on its side.



"But she isn't going to stop here!" cried Ned, as he found himself
thrown about like a pill in a box. "We're going all the way over!"



"Let her go over!" cried Tom, not that he could stop the tank now. "It
won't hurt her. She's built for just this sort of thing!"



And over Tank A did go. Over and over she rolled, sidewise, tumbling
and sliding down the shale sides of the great gully.



"Hold fast! Grab the rings!" cried Tom to his two companions in the
tower with him. "That's what they're for!"



Ned and Mr. Damon understood. In fact, the latter had already done as
Tom suggested. The young inventor had read that the British tanks
frequently turned turtle, and he had this in mind when he made
provision in his own for the safety of passengers and crew.



As soon as he felt the tank careening, Tom had pressed the signal
ordering the motors stopped, and now only the force of gravity was
operating. But that was sufficient to carry the big machine to the
bottom of the gulch, whither she slid with a great cloud of sand, shale
and dust.



"Bless my&mdash;bless my&mdash;" Mr. Damon was murmuring, but he was so flopped
about, tossed from one side to the other, and it took so much of his
attention and strength to hold on to the safety ring, that he could not
properly give vent; to one of his favorite expressions.



But there comes an end to all things, even to the descent of a tank,
and Tom's big machine soon stopped rolling, sliding, and turning
improvised somersaults, and rested in a pile of soft shale at the
bottom of the gully. And the tank was resting on her back!



"We've turned turtle!" cried Ned, as he noted that he was standing on
what, before, had been the ceiling of the observation tower. But as
everything was of steel, and as there was no movable furniture, no
great harm was done. In fact, one could as well walk on the ceiling of
the tank as on the floor.



"But how are you going to get her right side up?" asked Mr. Damon.



"Oh, turning upside down is only one of the stunts of the game. I can
right her," was the answer.



"How?" asked Ned.



"Well, she'll right herself if there's ground enough for the steel
belts to get a grip on.



"But can the motors work upside down?"



"They surely can!" responded Tom. "I made 'em that way on purpose. The
gasolene feeds by air pressure, and that works standing on its head, as
well as any other way. It's going to be a bit awkward for the men to
operate the controls, but we won't be this way long. Before I start to
right her, though, I want to make sure nothing is broken."



Tom signaled to the engine room, and, as the power was off and the
speaking tube could be used, he called through it:



"How are you down there?"



"Right-o!" came back the answer from a little Englishman Tom had hired
because he knew something about the British tanks. "'Twas a bit of
nastiness for a while, but it won't take us long to get up ag'in."



"That's good!" commented Tom. "I'll come down and have a look at you."



It was no easy matter, with the tank capsized, to get to the main
engine room, but Tom Swift managed it. To his delight, aside from a
small break in one of the minor machines, which would not interfere
with the operation or motive force of the monster war engine,
everything was in good shape. There was no leak from the gasolene
tanks, which was one of the contingencies Tom feared, and, as he had
said, the motors would work upside down as well as right side up, a
fact he had proved more than once in his Hawk.



"Well, we'll make a start," he told his chief engineer.  "Stand by when
I give the signal, and we'll try to crawl out of this right side up."



"How are you going to do it?" asked Ned, as his chum crawled back into
the observation tower.



"Well, I'm going to run her part way up the very steepest part of the
ravine I can find&mdash;the side of a house would do as well if it could
stand the strain. I'm going to stand the tank right up on her nose, so
to speak, and tip her over so she'll come right again."



Slowly the tank started off, while Tom and his friends in the
observation tower anxiously awaited the result of the novel progress.
Ned and Mr. Damon clung to the safety rings.  Tom put his arm through
one and hung on grimly, while he used both hands on the steering
apparatus and the controls.



Of course the trailer wheels were useless in a case of this kind, and
the tank had to be guided by the two belts run at varying speeds.



"Here we go!" cried Tom, and the tank started. It was a queer sensation
to be moving upside down, but it did not last very long. Tom steered
the tank straight at the opposite wall of the ravine, where it rose
steeply.  One of the broad belts ran up on that side. The other was
revolved in the opposite direction. Up and up, at a sickening angle,
went Tank A.



Slowly the tank careened, turning completely over on her longer axis,
until, as Tom shut off the power, he and his friends once more found
themselves standing where they belonged&mdash;on the floor of the
observation tower.



"Right side up with care!" quoted Ned, with a laugh. "Well, that was
some stunt&mdash;believe me!"



"Bless my corn plaster, I should say so!" cried Mr. Damon.



"Well, I'm glad it happened," commented Tom. "It showed what she can do
when she's put to it. Now we'll get out of this ditch."



Slowly the tank lumbered along, proper side up now, the men in the
motor room reporting that everything was all right, and that with the
exception of a slight unimportant break, no damage had been done.



Straight for the opposite steep side of the gully Tom directed his
strange craft, and at a point where the wall of the gulch gave a good
footing for the steel belts, Tank A pulled herself out and up to level
ground.



"Well, I'm glad that's over," remarked Ned, with a sigh of relief, as
the tank waddled along a straight stretch. "And to think of having to
do that same thing under heavy fire!"



"That's part of the game," remarked Tom. "And don't forget that we can
fire, too&mdash;or we'll be able to when I get the guns in place. They'll
help to balance the machine better, too, and render her less likely to
overturn."



Tom considered the test a satisfactory one and, a little later, guided
his tank back to the shop, where men were set to work repairing the
little damage done and making some adjustments.



"What's next on the program?" asked Ned of his chum one day about a
week later. "Any more tests in view?"



"Yes," answered Tom. "I've got the machine guns in place now. We are
going to try them out and also endeavor to demolish a building and some
barbed wire. Like to come along?"



"I would!" cried Ned.



A little later the tank was making her way over a field.  Tom pointed
toward a deserted factory, which had long been partly in ruins, but
some of the walls of which still stood.



"I'm going to bombard that," he announced, and then try to batter it
down and roll over it like a Juggernaut. Are you game?"



"Do your worst!" laughed Ned. "Let me man one of the machine guns!"



"All right," agreed Tom. "Concentrate your fire. Make believe you're
going against the Germans!"



Slowly, but with resistless energy, the tank approached the ruined
factory.



"Are you sure there's no one in it, Tom?"



"Sure! Blaze away!"






Chapter XV



Across Country



Ned Newton sighted his machine gun. Tom had showed him how to work it,
and indeed the young bank clerk had had some practice with a weapon
like this, erected on a stationary tripod. But this was the first time
Ned had attempted to fire from the tank while it was moving, and he
found it an altogether different matter.



"Say, it sure is hard to aim where you want to!" he shouted across to
Tom, it being necessary, even in the conning tower, where this one gun
was mounted, to speak loudly to make one's self heard above the hum,
the roar and rattle of the machinery in the interior of Tank A, and
below and to the rear of the two young men.



"Well, that's part of the game," Tom answered. "I'm sending her along
over as smooth ground as I can pick out, but it's rough at best. Still
this is nothing to what you'll get in Flanders."



"If I get there!" exclaimed Ned grimly. "Well, here goes!" and once
more he tried to aim the machine gun at the middle of the brick wall of
the ruined factory.



A moment later there was a rattle and a roar as the quick-firing
mechanism started, and a veritable hail of bullets swept out at the
masonry. Tom and Ned could see where they struck, knocking off bits of
stone, brick and cement.



"Sweep it, Ned! Sweep it!" cried Tom. "Imagine a crowd of Germans are
charging out at you, and sweep 'em out of the way!"



Obeying this command, the young man moved the barrel of the machine gun
from side to side and slightly up and down.  The effect was at once
apparent. The wall showed spatter-marks of the bullets over a wider
area, and had a body of Teutons been before the factory, or even inside
it, many of them would have been accounted for, since there were
several holes in the wall through which Ned's bullets sped, carrying
potential death with them.



"That's better!" shouted Tom. "That'll do the business!  Now I'm going
to open her up, Ned!"



"Open her up?" cried the young bank clerk, as he ceased firing.



"Yes; crack the wall of that factory as I would a nut!  Watch me take
it on high&mdash;that is, if the old tank doesn't go back on me!"



"You mean you're going to ride right over that building, Tom?"



"I mean I'm going to try! If Tank A does as I expect her to, she'll
butt into that wall, crush it down by force and weight, and then waddle
over the ruins. Watch!"



Tom sent some signals to the motor room. At once there was noticed an
increase in the vibrations of the ponderous machine.



"They're giving her more speed," said Tom. "And I guess we'll need it."



Straight for the old factory went Tank A. In spite of its ruined
condition, some of the walls were still firm, and seemed to offer a big
obstacle to even so powerful an engine of war as this monstrous tank.



"Get ready now, Ned," Tom advised. "And when I crack her open for you
cut loose with the machine gun again. This gun is supposed to fire
straight ahead and a little to either side. There are other guns at
left and right, amidships, as I might say, and there's also one in the
stern, to take care of any attack from that direction.



"The men in charge of them will fire at the same time you do, and it
will be as near like a real attack as we can make it&mdash;with the
exception of not being fired back at. And I wouldn't mind if such were
the case, for I don't believe anything, outside of heavy artillery,
will have any effect on this tank."



Tank A was now almost at her maximum speed as she approached closer to
the deserted factory. Ned and Tom, in the conning tower, saw the
largest of the remaining walls looming before them. Straight at it
rushed the ponderous machine, and the next moment there came a shock
which almost threw Ned away from his gun and back against the steel
wall behind him.



"Hold fast!" cried Tom. "Here we go! Fire. Ned! Fire!"



There was a crash as the blunt nose of the great war tank hit the wall
and crumpled it up.



A great hole was made in the masonry, and what was not crushed under
the caterpillar belts of the tank fell in a shower of bricks, stone and
cement on top of the machine.



Like a great hail storm the broken masonry pelted the steel sides and
top of the tank. But she felt them no more than does an alligator the
attacks of a colony of ants.  Right on through the dust the tank
crushed her way. Added to the noise of the falling walls was that of
the machine guns, which were barking away like a kennel of angry hounds
eager to be unleashed at the quarry.



Ned kept his gun going until the heat of it warned him to stop and let
the barrel cool, or he knew he would jam some of the mechanism. The
other guns were firing, too, and the bullets sent up little spatter
points of dust as they hit.



"Great jumping hoptoads!" yelled Ned above the riot of racket outside
and inside. "Feel her go, Tom!"



"Yes, she's just chewing it up, all right!" cried the young inventor,
his eyes shining with delight.



The tank had actually burst her way through the solid wall of the old
factory, permission to complete the demolition of which Tom had secured
from the owners. Then the great machine kept right on. She fairly
"walked" over the piles of masonry, dipped down into what had been a
basement, now partly filled with debris, and kept on toward another
wall.



"I'm going through that, too!" cried Tom.



And he did, knocking it down and sending his tank over the piled-up
ruins, while the machine guns barked, coughed and spluttered, as Ned
and the others inside the tank held back the firing levers.



Right through the opposite wall, as through the one she had already
demolished, the tank careened on her way, to emerge, rather battered
and dust-covered, on the other side of what was left of the factory.
And there was not much of it left. Tank A had well-nigh completed its
demolition.



"If there'd been a nest of Germans in there," said Tom, as he brought
the machine to a stop in a field beyond the factory, "they'd have
gotten out in a hurry."



"Or taken the consequences," added Ned, as he wiped the sweat from his
powder-blackened and oil-smeared face. "I certainly kept my gun going."



"Yes, and so did the others," reported one of the mechanics, as he
emerged from the "cubby hole," where the great motors had now ceased
their hum and roar.



"How'd she stand it?" asked Tom.



"All right inside," answered the man. "I was wondering how she looks
from the outside."



"Oh, it would take more than that to damage her," said Tom, with
pardonable pride. "That was pie for her! Solid concrete, which she may
have to chew up on the Western front, may present another kind of
problem, but I guess she'll be able to master that too. Well, let's
have a look."



He and Ned, with some of the crew and gunners, went outside the tank.
She was a sorry-looking sight, very different from the trim appearance
she had presented when she first left the shop. Bricks, bits of stone,
and piles of broken cement in chunks and dust lay thick on her broad
back. But no real damage had been done, as a hasty examination showed.



"Well, are you satisfied, Tom?" asked his chum.



"Yes, and more," was the answer. "Of course this wasn't the hardest
test to which she could have been submitted, but it will do to show
what punishment she can stand. Being shot at from big guns is another
matter. I'll have to wait until she gets to Flanders to see what effect
that will have. But I know the kind of armor skin she has, and that
doesn't worry me. There's one thing more I want to do while I have her
out now."



"What's that?" asked Ned.



"Take her for a long trip cross country, and then shove her through
some extra heavy barbed wire. I'm certain she'll chew that up, but I
want to see it actually done. So now, if you want to come along, Ned,
we'll go cross country."



"I'm with you!"



"Get inside then. We'll let the dust and masonry blow and rattle off as
we go along."



The tank started off across the fields, which stretched for many miles
on either side of the deserted factory, when suddenly Ned, who was
again at his post in the observation tower, called:



"Look, Tom!"



"What at?"



"That corner of the factory which is still standing. Look at those men
coming out and running away!"



Ned pointed, and his chum, leaning over from the steering wheel and
controls, gave a start of surprise as he saw three figures clambering
down over the broken debris and making their way out of what had once
been a doorway.



"Did they come out of the factory, Ned?"



"They surely did! And unless I miss my guess they were in it, or around
it, when we went through like a fellow carrying the football over the
line for a touchdown."



"In there when the tank broke open things?"



"I think so. I didn't see them before, but they certainly ran out as we
started away."



"This has got to be looked into!" decided Tom. "Come on, Ned! It may be
more of that spy business!"



Tom Swift stopped the tank and prepared to get out.






Chapter XVI



The Old Barn



"There's no use chasing after 'em, Tom," observed Ned, as the two chums
stood side by side outside the tank and gazed after the three men
running off across the fields as fast as they could go. "They've got
too much a start of us."



"I guess you're right, Ned," agreed Tom. "And we can't very well pursue
them in the tank. She goes a bit faster than anything of her build, but
a running man is more than a match for her in a short distance. If I
had the Hawk here, there'd be a different story to tell."



"Well, seeing that you haven't," replied Ned, "suppose we let them
go&mdash;which we'll have to, whether we want to or not&mdash;and see where they
were hiding and if they left any traces behind."



"That's a good idea," returned Tom.



The place whence the men had emerged was a portion of the old factory
farthest removed from the walls the tank had crunched its way through.
Consequently, that part was the least damaged.



Tom and Ned came to what seemed to have been the office of the building
when the factory was in operation. A door, from which most of the glass
had been broken, hung on one hinge, and, pushing this open, the two
chums found themselves in a room that bore evidences of having been the
bookkeeper's department. There were the remains of cabinet files, and a
broken letter press, while in one corner stood a safe.



"Maybe they were cracking that," said Ned.



"They were wasting their time if they were," observed Tom, "for the
combination is broken&mdash;any one can open it," and he demonstrated this
by swinging back one of the heavy doors.



A quantity of papers fell out, or what had been papers, for they were
now torn and the edges charred, as if by some recent fire.



"They were burning these!" cried Ned. "You can smell the smoke yet.
They came here to destroy some papers, and we surprised them!"



"I believe you're right," agreed Tom. "The ashes are still warm." And
he tested them with his hand. "They wanted to destroy something, and
when they found we were here they clapped the blazing stuff into the
safe, thinking it would burn there.



"But the closing of the doors cut off the supply of air and the fire
smouldered and went out. It burned enough so that it didn't leave us
very much in the way of evidence, though," went on Tom ruefully, as he
poked among the charred scraps.



"Maybe you can read some of 'em," suggested Ned.



"Part of the writing is in German," Tom said, as he looked over the
mass.  "I don't believe it would be worth while to try it.  Still, I
can save it.  Here, I'll sweep the stuff into a box, and if we get a
chance we can try to patch it together," and finding a broken box in
what had been the factory office the young inventor managed to get into
it the charred remains of the papers.



A further search failed to reveal anything that would be useful in the
way of evidence to determine what object the three men could have had
in hiding in the ruins, and Tom and Ned returned to the tank.



"What do you think about them, Tom?" asked Ned, as they were about to
start off once more for the cross-country test.



"Well, it seems like a silly thing to say&mdash;as if I imagined my tank was
all there was in this part of the country to make trouble&mdash;but I
believe those men had some connection with Simpson and with that spy
Schwen!"



"I agree with you!" exclaimed Ned. "And I think if we could get head or
tail of those burned papers we'd find that there was some
correspondence there between the man I saw up the tree and the workman
you had arrested."



"Too bad we weren't a bit quicker," commented Tom. "They must have been
in the factory when we charged it&mdash;probably came there to be in
seclusion while they talked, plotted and planned. They must have been
afraid to go out when the tank was walking through the walls."



"I guess that's it," agreed Ned. "Did you recognize any of the men,
Tom?"



"No, I didn't see 'em as soon as you did, and when they were running
they had their backs toward me. Was Simpson one?"



"I can't be sure. If one was, I guess he'll think we are keeping pretty
closely after him, and he may give this part of the country a wide
berth."



"I hope he does," returned Tom. "Do you know, Ned, I have an idea that
these fellows&mdash;Schwen Simpson, and those back of them, including
Blakeson&mdash;are trying to get hold of the secret of my tank for the
Germans."



"I shouldn't be surprised. But you've got it finished now, haven't you?
They can't get your patents away from you."



"No, it isn't that," said Tom. "There are certain secrets about the
mechanism of the tank&mdash;the way I've increased the speed and power, the
use of the spanners, and things like that&mdash;which would be useful for
the Germans to know. I wouldn't want them to find out these secrets,
and they could do that if they were in the tank a while, or had her in
their possession."



"They couldn't do that, Tom&mdash;get possession of her&mdash;could they?"



"There's no telling. I'm going to be doubly on the watch.  That fellow
Blakeson is in the pay of the plotters, I believe. He has a big machine
shop, and he might try to duplicate my tank if he knew how she was made
inside."



"I see! That's why he was inquiring about a good machinist, I suppose,
though he'll be mightily surprised when he learns it was you he was
talking to the time your Hawk met with the little mishap."



"Yes, I guess maybe he will be a bit startled," agreed Tom. "But I
haven't seen him around lately, and maybe he has given up."



"Don't trust to that!" warned Ned.



The tank was now progressing easily along over fields, hesitating not
at small or big ditches, flow going uphill and now down, across a
stretch of country thinly settled, where even fences were a rarity.
When they came to wooden ones Tom had the workmen get out and take down
the bars. Of course the tank could have crushed them like toothpicks,
but Tom was mindful of the rights of farmers, and a broken fence might
mean strayed cows, or the letting of cattle into a field of grain or
corn, to the damage of both cattle and fodder.



"There's a barbed-wire fence," observed Ned, as he pointed to one off
some distance across the field. "Why don't you try demolishing that?"



"Oh, it would be too easy!  Besides, I don't want the bother of putting
it up again. When I make the barbed-wire test I want some set up on
heavy posts, and with many strands, as it is in Flanders. Even that
won't stop the tank, but I'm anxious to see how she breaks up the wire
and supports&mdash;just what sort of a breach she makes. But I have a
different plan in mind now.



"I'm going to try to find a wooden building we can charge as we did the
masonry factory. I want to smash up a barn, and I'll have to pick out
an old one for choice, for in these war days we must conserve all we
can, even old barns."



"What's the idea of using a barn, Tom?"



"Well, I want to test the tank under all sorts of conditions&mdash;the same
conditions she'll meet with on the Western front. We've proved that a
brick and stone factory is no obstacle."



"Then how could a flimsy wooden barn be?"



"Well, that's just it. I don't think that it will, but it may be that a
barn when smashed will get tangled up in the endless steel belts, and
clog them so they'll jam. That's the reason I want to try a wooden
structure next."



"Do you know where to find one?"



"Yes; about a mile from here is one I've had my eyes on ever since I
began constructing the tank. I don't know who owns it, but it's such a
ramshackle affair that he can't object to having it knocked into
kindling wood for him. If he does holler, I can pay him for the damage
done. So now for a barn, Ned, unless you're getting tired and want to
go back?"



"I should say not! Speaking of barns, I'm with you till the cows come
home! Want any more machine gun work?"



"No, I guess not. This barn isn't particularly isolated, and the
shooting might scare horses and cattle. We can smash things up without
the guns."



The tank was going on smoothly when suddenly there was a lurch to one
side, and the great machine quickly swung about in a circle.



"Hello!" cried Ned. "What's up now? Some new stunt?"



"Must be something wrong," answered the young inventor.  "One of the
belts has stopped working. That's why we're going in a circle."



He shut off the power and hastened down to the motor room.  There he
found his men gathered about one of the machines.



"What's wrong?" asked Tom quickly.



"Just a little accident," replied the head machinist. "One of the boys
dropped his monkey wrench and it smashed some spark plugs. That caused
a short circuit and the left hand motor went out of business. We'll
have her fixed in a jiffy."



Tom looked relieved, and the machinist was as good as his word. In a
few minutes the tank was moving forward again. It crossed out to the
road, to the great astonishment of some farmers, and the fright of
their horses, and then Tom once more swung her into the fields.



"There's the old barn I spoke of," he remarked to Ned.  "It's almost as
bad a ruin as the factory was. But we'll have a go at it."



"Going to smash it?" asked Ned.



"I'm going right through it!" Tom cried






Chapter XVII



Veiled Threats



Like some prehistoric monster about to charge down upon another of its
kind, Tank A, under the guidance of Tom Swift, reeled and bumped her
way over the uneven fields toward the old barn. Within the monster of
steel and iron were raucous noises: the clang and clatter of the
powerful gasolene motors; the rattle of the wheels and gears; all
making so much noise that, in the engine room proper, not a word could
be heard. Every order had to be given by signs, and Tom sent his
electric signals from the conning tower in the same way. When running
at full speed, it was almost impossible, even in the tower, which was
some distance removed from the engine room, to hear voices unless the
words were shouted.



"Why don't you go at it?" cried Ned to his "friend, who was peering
through the observation slot in the tower."



"I'm getting in good position," Tom answered. "Or rather, the worst
position I can find. I want to give the tank a good try-out, and I'm
going at the barn on the assumption that this is in enemy country and
that I can't pick and choose my advance.



"So I want to come up through that gully, and go at the barn from the
long way. That will be the worst possible way I could do it, and if old
Tank A stands the gaff I'll know she's a little bit nearer all right."



"I think she's all right as she is!" asserted Ned in a yell, for just
then Tom signaled for more speed, and the consequent increase in the
rattling and banging noises made it correspondingly difficult for talk
to be heard.



The big machine now tipped into the little gully spoken of by Tom. This
meant a dip downward, and then a climb out again and an attack on the
barn going uphill and at an angle. But, as the young inventor had said,
it would make a severe test and that was what he wanted to give his
ponderous machine.



Ned grasped one of the safety rings, as, with a reel to one side,
almost as if it were going to capsize, the tank rumbled on. Tom cast a
half-amused smile at his chum, and then threw over the guiding lever.



The tank rolled down into the gully. It was rough and filled with
stones and boulders, some of considerable size.  But Tank A made less
than nothing even of the largest rocks.  Some she crushed beneath her
steel belts. Others she simply "walked" over, smashing them down into
the soil.



Now the big machine reached the bottom of the gulch and started up the
sides, which, though not as steep as the trench in which she had
capsized, still were not easy going.



"Now for it!" cried Tom, as he signaled for full speed.



Up climbed the tank. Now she was halfway. A moment later, and she was
at the top, and then a forward careening motion told that she had
passed over the summit and was ready for the attack proper.



Ned gave a quick glance through the slot nearest him. He had a glimpse
of the barn, and then he saw something else.  This was the sight of a
man running away from the dilapidated structure&mdash;a man who glanced
toward the tank with a face that showed great fright.



"Stop! Stop!" yelled Ned. "There may be folks in there, Tom! I just saw
a man run out!"



"All right!" Tom cried, though Ned could hardly hear him.  "Tell me
when we get on the other side! We're going through now!"



"But," shouted Ned, "don't you understand? I saw a man come out of
there! Maybe there's more inside! Wait, Tom, and&mdash;"



But it was too late. The next instant there was a smashing, grinding,
splintering crash, a noise as of a thunder-clap, and Tank A fairly ate
her way through the old barn as a rat might eat his way into a soft
cheese, only infinitely more quickly.



On and on and through and through went the tank, knocking beams,
boards, rafters and timbers hither and thither.  Minding not at all the
weight of great beams on her back, caring nothing for those that got in
the way of her steel belts, heeding not the wall of wood that reared
itself before her in a barrier of splinters and slivers, Tank A went on
and on until finally, with another grinding crash, as she smashed her
way through the farthermost wall, the great engine of war emerged on
the other side and came panting into the field, dragging with her a
part of the structure clinging to her steel sides.



"Well," cried Tom, with a laugh, as he signaled for the power to be
shut off, thereby making it possible for ordinary conversation to be
heard, "I guess we didn't do a thing to that barn!"



"Not much left of it, for a fact, Tom," agreed Ned, as he looked
through the after observation slots at the ruin in the rear. "But
didn't you hear what I was saying?"



"I heard you yelling something to me, but I was too anxious to go at it
as fast as I could. I didn't want to stop then. What was the trouble?"



"That's what I'm afraid of, Tom&mdash;there may be trouble.  Just before you
tackled the barn for a knockdown, instead of a touchdown, as we might
say, I saw a man running out of it.  I thought if there was one there,
perhaps there might be more. That's why I yelled to you."



"A man running from the old barn!" cried Tom. "Whew!" he whistled. "I
wish I had seen him. But, Ned, if one ran out of harm's way, any others
who might possibly be in there would do the same thing, wouldn't they?"



"I hope so," returned Ned doubtfully.



"Great Scott!" cried Tom, as the possibility was borne home to him. "If
anything has happened&mdash;"



He sprang for the door of the tower and threw over the catch, springing
out, followed by Ned. From the engine room of the armored tank the men
came, smiles of gratification on their faces.



"We certainly busted her wide open, Mr. Swift!" called the chief
mechanician.



"Yes," assented the young inventor; but there was not as much
gratification in his voice as there should have been.  "There isn't
much of a barn left, but Ned thinks he saw some one run out, and if
there was one man there may have been more. We'd better have a look
around, I guess."



The engineering force exchanged glances. Then Hank Baldwin, who was in
charge of the motors, said:



"Well, if there was anybody in that barn when we chewed her up I
wouldn't give much for his hide, German or not."



"Let us hope no one was in there," murmured Tom.



They turned to go back to the demolished structure, fear and worry in
their hearts. No more complete ruin could be imagined. If a cyclone had
swept over the barn it could not have more certainly leveled it. And,
not only was it leveled, crushed down in the center by the great weight
of the tank, but the boards and beams were broken into small pieces.
Parts of them clung in long, grotesque splinters to the endless steel
belts.



"I don't see how we're going to find anybody if he's in there,"
remarked Hank.



"We'll have to," insisted Tom. "We can look about and call. If any one
is there he may have been off to one side or to one end, and be
protected under the debris. I wish I had heard you call, Ned."



"I wish you had, Tom. I yelled for all I was worth."



"I know you did. I was too eager to go on, and, at the same time, I
really couldn't stop well on that hill. I had to keep on going. Well,
now to learn the worst!"



They walked back toward the demolished barn. But they had not reached
it when from around the corner swung a big automobile. In it were
several men, but chief, in vision at least, among them, was a burly
farmer who had a long, old-fashioned gun in his hands. On his bearded
face was a grim look as he leaped out before the machine had fairly
stopped, and called:



"Hold on, there! I guess you've done damage enough! Now you can pay for
it or take the consequences!" And he motioned to Tom, Ned, and the
others to halt.






Chapter XVIII



Ready for France



Such was the reaction following the crashing through of the barn,
coupled with the sudden appearance of the men in the automobile and the
threat of the farmer, that, for the moment, Tom, Ned, or their
companions from the tank could say nothing. They just stood staring at
the farmer with the gun, while he grimly regarded them. It was Tom who
spoke first.



"What's the idea?" asked the young inventor. "Why don't you want us to
look through the ruins?"



"You'll learn soon enough!" was the grim answer.



But Tom was not to be put off with undecided talk.



"If there's been an accident," he said, "we're sorry for it. But delay
may be dangerous. If some one is hurt&mdash;"



"You'll be hurt, if I have my way about it!" snapped the farmer, "and
hurt in a place where it always tells. I mean your pocketbook! That's
the kind of a man I am&mdash;practical."



"He means if we've killed or injured any one we'll have to pay
damages," whispered Ned to Tom. "But don't agree to anything until you
see your lawyer. That's a hot one, though, trying to claim damages
before he knows who's hurt!"



"I've got to find out more about this," Tom answered. He started to
walk on.



"No you don't!" cried the farmer, with a snarl. "As I said, you folks
has done damage enough with your threshing machine, or whatever you
call it. Now you've got to pay!"



"We are willing to," said Tom, as courteously as he could.  "But first
we want to know who has been hurt, or possibly killed. Don't you think
it best to get them to a doctor, and then talk about money damages
later?"



"Doctor? Hurt?" cried the farmer, the other men in the auto saying
nothing. "Who said anything about that?"



"I thought," began Tom, "that you&mdash;"



"I'm talkin' about damages to my barn!" cried the farmer.  "You had no
right to go smashing it up this way, and you've got to pay for it, or
my name ain't Amos Kanker!"



"Oh!" and there was great relief in Tom's voice. "Then we haven't
killed any one?"



"I don't know what you've done," answered the farmer, and his voice was
not a pleasant one. "I'm sure I can't keep track of all your ructions.
All I know is that you've ruined my barn, and you've got to pay for it,
and pay good, too!"



"For that old ramshackle?" cried Ned.



"Hush!" begged Tom, in a low voice. "I'm willing to pay, Ned, for the
sake of having proved what my tank could do.  I'm only too glad to
learn no one was hurt. Was there?" he asked, turning to the farmer.



"Was there what?"



"Was there anybody in your barn?"



"Not as I knows on," was the grouchy answer. "A man who saw your
machine coming thought she was headed for my building, and he run and
told me. Then some friends of mine brought me here in their machine. I
tell you I've got all the evidence I need ag'in you, an' I'm going to
have damages! That barn was worth three thousand dollars if it was
worth a cent, and&mdash;"



"This matter can easily be settled," said Tom, trying to keep his
temper. "My name is Swift, and&mdash;"



"Don't get swift with me, that's all I ask!" and the farmer laughed
grimly at his clumsy joke.



"I'll do whatever is right," Tom said, with dignity. "I live over near
Shopton, and if you want to send your lawyer to see mine, why&mdash;"



"I don't believe in lawyers!" broke in the farmer. "All they think of
is to get what they can for theirselves. And I can do that myself. I'll
get it out of you before you leave, or, anyhow, before you take your
contraption away," and he glanced at the tank.



The same suspicion came at once to Tom and Ned, and the latter gave
voice to it when he murmured in a low voice to his chum:



"This is a frame-up&mdash;a scheme, Tom.  He doesn't care a rap for the
barn. It's some of that Blakeson's doing, to make trouble for you."



"I believe you!" agreed Tom. "Now I know what to do."



He looked toward the collapsed barn, as if making a mental computation
of its value, and then turned toward the farmer.



"I'm very sorry," said Tom, "if I have caused any trouble.  I wanted to
test my machine out on a wooden structure, and I picked your barn. I
suppose I should have come to you first, but I did not want to waste
time. I saw the barn was of practically no value."



"No value!" broke in the farmer. "Well, I'll show you, young man, that
you can't play fast and loose with other people's property and not
settle!"



"I'm perfectly willing to, Mr. Kanker. I could see that the barn was
almost ready to fall, and I had already determined, before sending my
tank through it, to pay the owner any reasonable sum. I am willing to
do that now."



"Well, of course if you're so ready to do that," replied the farmer,
and Ned thought he caught a glance pass between him and one of the men
in the auto, "if you're ready to do that, just hand over three thousand
dollars, and we'll call it a day's work. It's really worth more, but
I'll say three thousand for a quick settlement."



"Why, this barn," cried Ned, "isn't worth half that! I know something
about real estate values, for our bank makes loans on farms around
here&mdash;"



"Your bank ain't made me no loans, young man!" snapped Mr. Kanker. "I
don't need none. My place is free and clear! And three thousand dollars
is the price of my barn you've knocked to smithereens. If you don't
want to pay, I'll find a way to make you. And I'll hold you, or your
tank, as you call it, security for my damages! You can take your choice
about that."



"You can't hold us!" cried Tom. "Such things aren't done here!"



"Well, then, I'll hold your tank!" cried the farmer. "I guess it'll
sell for pretty nigh onto what you owe me, though what it's good for I
can't see. So you pay me three thousand dollars or leave your machine
here as security."



"That's the game!" whispered Ned. "There's some plot here.  They want
to get possession of your tank, Tom, and they've seized on this chance
to do it."



"I believe you," agreed the young inventor. "Well, they'll find that
two can play at that game. Mr. Kanker," he went on, "it is out of the
question to claim your barn is worth three thousand dollars."



"Oh, is it?" sneered the farmer. "Well, I didn't ask you to come here
and make kindling wood of it! That was your doings, and you've had your
fun out of it. Now you can pay the piper, and I'm here to make you
pay!" And he brought the gun around in a menacing manner.



"He's right, in a way," said Ned to his chum. "We should have secured
his permission first. He's got us in a corner, and almost any jury of
farmers around here, after they heard the story of the smashed barn,
would give him heavy damages.  It isn't so much that the barn is worth
that as it is his property rights that we've violated. A farmer's barn
is his castle, so to speak."



"I guess you're right," agreed Tom, with a rather rueful face. "But I'm
not going to hand him over three thousand dollars. In fact, I haven't
that much with me."



"Oh, well, I don't suppose he'd want it all in cash."



But, it appeared, that was just what the farmer wanted. He went over
all his arguments again, and it could not be denied that he had the law
on his side. As he rightly said, Tom could not expect to go about the
country, "smashing up barns and such like," without being willing to
pay.



"Well, what you going to do?" asked the farmer at last. "I can't stay
here all day. I've got work to do. I can't go around smashing barns. I
want three thousand dollars, or I'll hold your contraption for
security."



This last he announced with more conviction after he had had a talk
with one of the men in the automobile. And it was this consultation
that confirmed Tom and Ned in their belief that the whole thing was a
plot, growing out of Tom's rather reckless destruction of the barn; a
plot on the part of Blakeson and his gang. That they had so speedily
taken advantage of this situation carelessly given them was only
another evidence of how closely they were on Tom's trail.



"That man who ran out of the barn must have been the same one who was
in the factory," whispered Ned to his chum. "He probably saw us coming
this way and ran on ahead to have the farmer all primed in readiness.
Maybe he knew you had planned to ram the barn."



"Maybe he did. I've had it in mind for some time, and spoken to some of
my men about it."



"More traitors in camp, then, I'm afraid, Tom. We'll have to do some
more detective work. But let's get this thing settled. He only wants to
hold your tank, and that will give the man, into whose hands he's
playing, a chance to inspect her."



"I believe you. But if I have to leave her here I'll leave some men on
guard inside. It won't be any worse than being stalled in No Man's
Land. In fact, it won't be so bad. But I'll do that rather than be
gouged."



"No, Tom, you won't. If you did leave some one on guard, there'd be too
much chance of their getting the best of him.  You must take your tank
away with you."



"But how can I? I can't put up three thousand dollars in cash, and he
says he won't take a check for fear I'll stop payment. I see his game,
but I don't see how to block it."



"But I do!" cried Ned.



"What!" exclaimed Tom. "You don't mean to say, even if you do work in a
bank, that you've got three thousand in cash concealed about your
person, do you?"



"Pretty nearly, Tom, or what is just as good. I have that amount in
Liberty Bonds. I was going to deliver them to a customer who has
ordered them but not paid for them. They are charged up against me at
the bank, but I'm good for that, I guess. Now I'll loan you these
bonds, and you can give them to this cranky old farmer as security for
damages.  Mind, don't make them as a payment. They're simply
security&mdash;the same as when an autoist leaves his car as bail. Only we
don't want to leave our car, we'd rather have it with us," and he
looked over at the tank, bristling with splinters from the demolished
barn.



"Well, I guess that's the only way out," said Tom. "Lucky you had those
bonds with you. I'll take them, and give you a receipt for them. In
fact, I'll buy them from you and let the farmer hold them as security."



And this, eventually, was done. After much hemming and hawing and
consultation with the men in the automobile, Mr. Kanker said he would
accept the bonds. It was made clear that they were not in payment of
any damages, though Tom admitted he was liable for some, but that Uncle
Sam's war securities were only a sort of bail, given to indicate that,
some time later, when a jury had passed on the matter, the young
inventor would pay Mr. Kanker whatever sum was agreed upon as just.



"And now," said Tom, as politely as he could under the circumstances,
"I suppose we will be allowed to depart."



"Yes, take your old shebang offen my property!" ordered Mr. Kanker,
with no very good grace. "And if you go knocking down any more barns,
I'll double the price on you!"



"I guess he's a bit roiled because he couldn't hold the tank," observed
Ned to Tom, as they walked together to the big machine. "His
friends&mdash;our enemies&mdash;evidently hoped that was what could be done. They
want to get at some of the secrets."



"I suppose so," conceded Tom. "Well, we're out of that, and I've proved
all I want to."



"But I haven't&mdash;quite," said Ned.



"What's missing?" asked his chum, as they got back in the tank.



"Well, I'd like to make sure that the fellow who ran from the factory
was the same one I saw sneaking out of the barn.  I believe he was, and
I believe that Simpson's crowd engineered this whole thing."



"I believe so, too," Tom agreed. "The next thing is to prove it. But
that will keep until later. The main thing is we've got our tank, and
now I'm going to get her ready for France."



"Will she be in shape to ship soon?" asked Ned.



"Yes, if nothing more happens. I've got a few little changes and
adjustments to make, and then she'll be ready for the last test&mdash;one of
long distance endurance mainly.  After that, apart she comes to go to
the front, and we'll begin making 'em in quantities here and on the
other side."



"Good!" cried Ned. "Down with the Huns!"



Without further incident of moment they went back to the headquarters
of the tank, and soon the great machine was safe in the shop where she
had been made.



The next two weeks were busy ones for Tom, and in them he put the
finishing touches on his machine, gave it a long test over fields and
through woods, until finally he announced:



"She's as complete as I can make her!  She's ready for France!"






Chapter XIX



Tom is Missing



With Tom Swift's announcement, that his tank was at last ready for real
action, came the end of the long nights and days given over on the part
of his father, himself, and his men to the development and refinement
of the machine, to getting plans and specifications ready so that the
tanks could be made quickly and in large numbers in this country and
abroad and to the actual building of Tank A. Now all this was done at
last, and the first completed tank was ready to be shipped.



Meanwhile the matter of the demolished barn had been left for legal
action. Tom and Ned, it developed, had done the proper thing under the
circumstances, and they were sure they had foiled at least one plan of
the plotters.



"But they won't stop there," declared Ned, who had constituted himself
a sort of detective. "They're lying back and waiting for another
chance, Tom."



"Well, they won't get it at my tank!" declared the young inventor, with
a smile. "I've finished testing her on the road. All I need do now is
to run her around this place if I have to; and there won't be much need
of that before she's taken apart for shipment. Did you get any trace of
Simpson or the men who are with him&mdash;Blakeson and the others?"



"No," Ned answered. "I've been nosing around about that farmer, Kanker,
but I can't get anything out of him. For all that, I'm sure he was
egged on to his hold-up game by some of your enemies. Everything points
that way."



"I think you're right," agreed Tom. "Well, we won't bother any more
about him. When the trial comes on, I'll pay what the jury says is
right. It'll be worth it, for I proved that Tank A can eat up brick,
stone or wooden buildings and not get indigestion. That's what I set
out to do. So don't worry any more about it, Ned."



"I'm not worrying, but I'd like to get the best of those fellows. The
idea of asking three thousand dollars for a shell of a barn!"



"Never mind," replied Tom. "We'll come out all right."



Now that the Liberty Loan drive had somewhat slackened, Ned had more
leisure time, and he spent parts of his days and not a few of his
evenings at Tom Swift's. Mr. Damon was also a frequent visitor, and he
never tired of viewing the tank. Every chance he got, when they tested
the big machine in the large field, so well fenced in, the eccentric
man was on hand, with his "bless my&mdash;!" whatever happened to come most
readily to his mind.



Tom, now that his invention was well-nigh perfected, was not so worried
about not having the tank seen, even at close range, and the enclosure
was not so strictly guarded.



This in a measure was disappointing to Eradicate, who liked the
importance of strutting about with a nickel shield pinned to his coat,
to show that he was a member of the Swift & Company plant. As for the
giant Koku, he really cared little what he did, so long as he pleased
Tom, for whom he had an affection that never changed. Koku would as
soon sit under a shady tree doing nothing as watch for spies or
traitors, of whose identity he was never sure.



So it came that there was not so strict a guard about the place, and
Tom and Ned had more time to themselves. Not that the young inventor
was not busy, for the details of shipping Tank A to France came to him,
as did also the arrangements for making others in this country and
planning for the manufacture abroad.



It was one evening, after a particularly hard day's work, when Tom had
been making a test in turning the tank in a small space in the enclosed
yard, that the two young men were sitting in the machine shop,
discussing various matters.



The telephone bell rang, and Ned, being nearest, answered.



"It's for you, Tom," he said, and there was a smile on the face of the
young bank clerk.



"Um!" murmured Tom, and he smiled also.



Ned could not repress more smiles as Tom took up the conversation over
the wire, and it did not take long for the chum of the youthful
inventor to verify his guess that Mary Nestor was at the other end of
the instrument.



"Yes, yes," Tom was heard to say. "Why, of course, I'll be glad to come
over. Yes, he's here. What? Bring him along? I will if he'll come. Oh,
tell him Helen is there! 'Nough said! He'll come, all right!"



And Tom, without troubling to consult his friend, hung up the receiver.



"What's that you're committing me to?" asked Ned.



"Oh, Mary wants us to come over and spend the evening.  Helen Sever is
there, and they say we can take them downtown if we like."



"I guess we like," laughed Ned. "Come along! We've had enough of musty
old problems," for he had been helping Tom in some calculations
regarding strength of materials and the weight-bearing power of
triangularly constructed girders as compared to the arched variety.



"Yes, I guess it will do us good to get out," and the two friends were
soon on their way.



"What's this?" asked Mary, with a laugh, as Tom held out a package tied
with pink string. "More dynamite?" she added, referring to an incident
which had once greatly perturbed the excitable Mr. Nestor.



"If she doesn't want it, perhaps Helen will take it," suggested Ned,
with a twinkle in his eyes. "Halloran said they were just in fresh&mdash;"



"Oh, you delightful boy!" cried Helen. "I'm just dying for some
chocolates! Let me open them, Mary, if you're afraid of dynamite."



"The only powder in them," said Tom, "is the powdered sugar. That can't
blow you up."



And then the young people made merry, Tom, for the time being,
forgetting all about his tank.



It was rather late when the two young men strolled back toward the
Swift home, Ned walking that way with his chum.  Tom started out in the
direction of the building where the tank was housed.



"Going to have a good-night look at her?" asked Ned.



"Well, I want to make sure the watchman is on guard. We'll begin taking
her apart in a few days, and I don't want anything to happen between
now and then."



They walked on toward the big structure, and, as they approached from
the side, they were both startled to see a dark shadow&mdash;at least so it
seemed to the youths&mdash;dart away from one of the windows.



"Look!" gasped Ned.



"Hello, there!" cried Tom sharply. "Who's that? Who are you?"



There was no answer, and then the fleeing shadow was merged in the
other blackness of the night.



"Maybe it was the watchman making his rounds," suggested Ned.



"No," answered Tom, as he broke into a run. "If it was, he'd have
answered. There's something wrong here!"



But he could find nothing when he reached the window from which he and
Ned had seen the shadow dart. An examination by means of a pocket
electric light betrayed nothing wrong with the sash, and if there were
footprints beneath the casement they indicated nothing, for that side
of the factory was one frequently used by the workmen.



Tom went into the building, and, for a time, could not find the
watchman. When he did come upon the man, he found him rubbing his eyes
sleepily, and acting as though he had just awakened from a nap.



"This isn't any way to be on duty!" said Tom sharply.  "You're not paid
for sleeping!"



"I know it, Mr. Swift," was the apologetic answer. "I don't know what's
come over me to-night. I never felt so sleepy in all my life. I had my
usual sleep this afternoon, too, and I've drunk strong coffee to keep
awake."



"Are you sure you didn't drink anything else?"



"You know I'm a strict temperance man."



"I know you are," said Tom; "but I thought maybe you might have a cold,
or something like that."



"No, I haven't taken a thing. I did have a drink of soda water before I
came on duty, but that's all."



"Where'd you get it?" asked Tom.



"Well, a man treated me."



"Who?"



"I don't know his name. He met me on the street and asked me how to get
to Plowden's hardware store. I showed him&mdash;walked part of the way, in
fact&mdash;and when I left he said he was going to have some soda, and asked
me to have some. I did, and it tasted good."



"Well, don't go to sleep again," suggested Tom good-naturedly.  "Did
you hear anything at the side window a while ago?"



"Not a thing, Mr. Swift. I'll be all right now. I'll take a turn
outside in the air."



"All right," assented the young inventor.



Then, as he turned to go into the house and was bidding Ned good-night,
Tom said:



"I don't like this."



"What?" asked his chum.



"My sleepy watchman and the figure at the window. I more than half
suspect that one of Blakeson's tools followed Kent for the purpose of
buying him soda, only I think they might have put a drop or two of
chloral in it before he got it.  That would make him sleep."



"What are you going to do, Tom?"



"Put another man on guard. If they think they can get into the factory
at night, and steal my plans, or get ideas from my tank, I'll fool 'em.
I'll have another man on guard."



This Tom did, also telling Koku to sleep in the place, to be ready if
called. But there was no disturbance that night, and the next day the
work of completing the tank went on with a rush.



It was a day or so after this, and Tom had fixed on it as the time for
taking the big machine apart for shipment, that Ned received a
telephone message at the bank from Mr. Damon.



"Is Tom Swift over with you?" inquired the eccentric man.



"No. Why?" Ned answered.



"Well, I'm at his shop, and he isn't here. His father says he received
a message from you a little while ago, saying to come over in a hurry,
and he went. Says you told him to meet you out at that farmer Kanker's
place. I thought maybe&mdash;"



"At Kanker's place!" cried Ned. "Say, something's wrong, Mr. Damon!
Isn't Tom there?"



"No; I'm at his home, and he's been gone for some time.  His father
supposed he was with you. I thought I would telephone to make sure."



"Whew!" whistled Ned. "There's something doing here, all right, and
something wrong! I'll be right over!" he added, as he hung up the
receiver.






Chapter XX



The Search



"Haven't you seen anything of him?" asked Mr. Damon, as Ned jumped out
of his small runabout at the Swift home as soon as possible after
receiving the telephone message that seemed to presage something wrong.



"Seen him? No, certainly not!" answered the young bank clerk. "I'm as
much surprised as you are over it. What happened, anyhow?"



"Bless my memorandum pad, but I hardly know!" answered the eccentric
man. "I arrived here a little while ago, stopping in merely to pay Tom
a visit, as I often do, and he wasn't here. His father was anxiously
waiting for him, too, wishing to consult him about some shop matters.
Mr. Swift said Tom had gone out with you, or over to your house&mdash;I
wasn't quite sure which at first&mdash;and was expected back any minute.



"Then I called you up," went on Mr. Damon, "and I was surprised to
learn you hadn't seen Tom. There must be something wrong, I think."



"I'm sure of it!" exclaimed Ned. "Let's find Mr. Swift.  And what's
this about his going to meet me over at the place of that farmer, Mr.
Kanker, where we had the trouble about the barn Tom demolished?"



"I hardly know, myself. Perhaps Mr. Swift can tell us."



But Mr. Swift was able to throw but little light on Tom's
disappearance&mdash;whether a natural or forced disappearance remained to be
seen.



"No matter where he is, we'll get him," declared Ned. "He hasn't been
away a great while, and it may turn out that his absence is perfectly
natural."



"And if it's due to the plots of any of his rivals," said Mr. Damon,
"I'll denounce them all as traitors, bless my insurance policy, if I
don't! And that's what they are!  They're playing into the hands of the
enemy!"



"All right," said Ned. "But the thing to do now is to get Tom. Perhaps
Mrs. Baggert can help us."



It developed that the housekeeper was of more assistance in giving
information than was Mr. Swift.



"It was several hours ago," she said, "that the telephone rang and some
one asked for Tom. The operator shifted the call to the phone out in
the tank shop where he was, and Tom began to talk. The operator, as Tom
had instructed her, listened in, as Tom wants always a witness to most
matters that go on over his wires of late."



"What did she hear?" asked Ned eagerly.



"She heard what she thought was your voice, I believe," the housekeeper
said.



"Me!" cried the young bank clerk. "I haven't talked to Tom to-day, over
the phone or any other way. But what next?"



"Well, the operator didn't listen much after that, knowing that any
talk between Tom and you was of a nature not to need a witness. Tom
hung up and then he came in here, quite excited, and began to get ready
to go out."



"What was he excited about?" asked Mr. Damon. "Bless my unlucky stars,
but a person ought to keep calm under such circumstances! That's the
only way to do! Keep calm! Great Scott! But if I had my way, all those
German spies would be&mdash;Oh, pshaw! Nothing is too bad for them! It makes
my blood boil when I think of what they've done! Tom should have kept
cool!"



"Go on. What was Tom excited about?" Ned turned to the housekeeper.



"Well, he said you had called him to tell him to meet you over at that
farmer's place," went on Mrs. Baggert. "He said you had some news for
him about the men who had tried to get hold of some of his tank
secrets, and he was quite worked up over the chance of catching the
rascals."



"Whew!" whistled Ned. "This is getting more complicated every minute.
There's something deep here, Mr. Damon."



"I agree with you, Ned. And the sooner we find Tom Swift the better.
What next, Mrs. Baggert?"



"Well, Tom got ready and went away in his small automobile. He said
he'd be back as soon as he could after meeting you."



"And I never said a word to him!" cried Ned. "It's all a plot&mdash;a scheme
of that Blakeson gang to get him into their power. Oh, how could Tom be
so fooled? He knows my voice, over the phone as well as otherwise. I
don't see how he could be taken in."



"Let's ask the telephone operator," suggested Mr. Damon.  "She knows
your voice, too. Perhaps she can give us a clew."



A talk with the young woman at the telephone switchboard in the Swift
plant brought out a new point. This was that the speaker, in response
to whose information Tom Swift had left home, had not said he was Ned
Newton.



"He said," reported Miss Blair, "that he was speaking for you, Mr.
Newton, as you were busy in the bank. Whoever it was, said you wanted
Tom to meet you at the Kanker farm. I heard that much over the wire,
and naturally supposed the message came from you."



"Well, that puts a little different face on it," said Mr. Damon. "Tom
wasn't deceived by the voice, then, for he must have thought it was
some one speaking for you, Ned."



"But the situation is serious, just the same," declared Ned. "Tom has
gone to keep an appointment I never made, and the question is with whom
will he keep it?"



"That's it!" cried the eccentric man. "Probably some of those
scoundrels were waiting at the farm for him, and they've got him no one
knows where by this time!"



"Oh, hardly as bad as that," suggested Ned. "Tom is able to look out
for himself. He'd put up a big fight before he'd permit himself to be
carried off."



"Well, what do you think did happen?" asked Mr. Damon.



"I think they wanted to get him out to the farm to see if they couldn't
squeeze some more money out of him," was the answer. "Tom was pretty
easy in that barn business, and I guess Kanker was sore because he
haven't asked a larger sum.  They knew Tom wouldn't come out on their
own invitation, so they forged my name, so to speak."



"Can you get Tom back?" asked Mrs. Baggert anxiously.



"Of course!" declared Ned, though it must be admitted he spoke with
more confidence than he really felt. "We'll begin the search right
away."



"And if I can get my hands on any of those villains&mdash;" spluttered Mr.
Damon, dancing around, as Mrs. Baggert said, "like a hen on a hot
griddle," which seemed to describe him very well, "if I can get hold of
any of those scoundrels, I'll&mdash;I'll&mdash;Bless my collar button, I don't
know what I will do! Come on, Ned!"



"Yes, I guess we'd better get busy," agreed the young bank clerk. "Tom
has gone somewhere, that's certain, and under a misapprehension. It may
be that we are needlessly alarmed, or they may mean bad business. At
any rate, it's up to us to find Tom."



In Ned's runabout, which was a speedier car than that of the eccentric
man, the two set off for Kanker's farm. On the way they stopped at
various places in town, where Tom was in the habit of doing business,
to inquire if he had been seen.



But there was no trace of him. The next thing to do was to learn if he
had really started for the Kanker farm.



"For if he didn't go there," suggested Ned, "it will look funny for us
to go out there making inquiries about him. And it may be that after he
got that message Tom decided not to go."



Accordingly they made enough inquiries to establish the fact that Tom
had started for the farm of the rascally Kanker, who had been so
insistent in the matter of his almost worthless barn.



A number of people who knew Tom well had seen him pass in the direction
of Kanker's place, and some had spoken to him, for the young inventor
was well known in the vicinity of Shopton and the neighboring towns.



"Well, out to Kanker's we'll go!" decided Ned. "And if anything has
happened to Tom there&mdash;well, we'll make whoever is responsible wish it
hadn't!"



"Bless my fountain pen, but that's what we will!" chimed in Mr. Damon.



And so the two began the search for the missing youth.






Chapter XXI



A Prisoner



Amos Kanker came to the door of his farmhouse as Ned and Mr. Damon
drove up in the runabout. There was an unpleasant grin on the not very
prepossessing face of the farmer, and what Ned thought was a cunning
look, as he slouched out and asked:



"Well, what do you want? Come to smash up any more of my barns at three
thousand dollars a smash?"



"Hardly," answered Ned shortly. "Your prices are too high for such
ramshackle barns as you have. Where's Tom Swift?" he asked sharply.



"Huh! Do you mean that young whipper-snapper with his big traction
engine?" demanded Mr. Kanker.



"Look here!" blustered Mr. Damon, "Tom Swift is neither a
whipper-snapper nor is his machine a traction engine. It's a war tank."



"That doesn't matter much to me," said the farmer, with a grating
laugh. "It looks like a traction engine, though it smashes things up
more'n any one I ever saw."



"That isn't the point," broke in Ned. "Where is my friend, Tom Swift?
That's what we want to know."



"Huh! What makes you think I can tell you?" demanded Kanker.



"Didn't he come out here?" asked Mr. Damon.



"Not as I knows of," was the surly answer.



"Look here!" exclaimed Ned, and his tones were firm, with no bluster
nor bluff in them, "we came out here to find Tom Swift, and we're going
to find him! We have reason to believe he's here&mdash;at least, he started
for here," he substituted, as he wished to make no statement he could
not prove. "Now we don't claim we have any right to be on your
property, and we don't intend to stay here any longer than we can help.
But we do claim the right, in common decency, to ask if you have seen
anything of Tom. There may have been an accident; there may have been
foul play; and there may be international complications in this
business. If there are, those involved won't get off as easily as they
think.  I'd advise you to keep a civil tongue in your head and answer
our questions. If we have to get the police and detectives out here, as
well as the governmental department of justice, you may have to answer
their questions, and they won't be as decent to you as we are!"



"Hurray!" whispered Mr Damon to Ned. "That's the way to talk!"



And indeed the forceful remarks of the young bank clerk did appear to
have a salutary effect on the surly farmer.  His manner changed at once
and his grin faded.



"I don't know nothing about Tom Swift or any of your friends," he said.
"I've got my farm work to do, and I do it. It's hard enough to earn a
living these war times without taking part in plots. I haven't seen Tom
Swift since the trouble he made about my barn."



"Then he hasn't been here to-day?" asked Ned.



"No; and not for a good many days."



Ned looked at Mr. Damon, and the two exchanged uneasy glances. Tom had
certainly started for the Kanker farm, and indeed had come to within a
few miles of it. That much was certain, as testified to by a number of
residents along the route from Shopton, who had seen the young inventor
passing in his car.



Now it appeared he had not arrived. The changed air of the farmer
seemed to indicate that he was speaking the truth.  Mr. Damon and Ned
were inclined to believe him. If they had any last, lingering doubts in
the matter, they were dispelled when Mr. Kanker said:



"You can search the place if you like. I haven't any reason to feel
friendly toward you, but I certainly don't want to get into trouble
with the Government. Look around all you like."



"No, we'll take your word for it," said Ned, quickly concluding that
now they had got the farmer where they wanted him, they could gain more
by an appearance of friendliness than by threats or harsh words. "Then
you haven't seen him, either?"



"Not a sign of him."



"One thing more," went on Tom's chum, "and then we'll look farther.
Weren't you induced by a man named Simpson, or one named Blakeson, to
make the demand of three thousand dollars' damage for your barn?"



"No, it wasn't anybody of either of those names," admitted Mr. Kanker,
evidently a bit put out by the question.



"It was some one, though, wasn't it?" insisted Ned.



"Waal, a man did come to me the day the barn was smashed, and just
afore it happened, and said an all-fired big traction engine was headed
this way, and that a young feller who was half crazy was running it.
This man&mdash;I don't know who he was, being a stranger to me&mdash;said if the
engine ran into any of my property and did damages I should collect for
it on the spot, or hold the machine.



"Sure enough, that's what happened, and I did it. That man had an auto,
and he brought me and some of my men out to the smashed barn. That's
all I know about it."



"I thought some one put you up to it," commented Ned.  "This was some
of the gang's work," he went on to Mr. Damon.  "They hoped to get
possession of Tom's tank long enough to find out some of the secrets.
By having the Liberty Bonds, I fooled 'em."



"That's what you did!" said Mr. Damon. "But what can we do now?"



"I don't know," Ned was forced to admit. "But I should think we'd
better go back to the last place where he was seen to pass in his auto,
and try to get on his trail."



Mr. Damon agreed that this was a wise plan, and, after a casual look
around the farmhouse and other buildings on Kanker's place and finding
nothing to arouse their suspicions, the two left in Ned's speedy little
machine.



"It is mighty queer!" remarked the young bank clerk, as they shot along
the country road. "It isn't like Tom to get caught this way."



"Maybe he isn't caught," suggested the other. "Tom has been in many a
tight place and gotten out, as you and I well know.  Maybe it will be
the same now, though it does look suspicious, that fake message coming
from you."



"Not coming from me, you mean," corrected Ned. "Well, we'll do the best
we can."



They proceeded back to where they had last had a trace of Tom in his
machine, and there could only confirm what they had learned at first,
namely, that the young inventor had departed in the direction of the
Kanker farm, after having filled his radiator with water, and chatting
with a farmer he knew.



"Then this is where the trail divides," said Ned, as they went back
over the road, coming to a point where the highway branched off. "If he
went this way, he went to Kanker's place, or he would be in the way of
going. He isn't there, it seems, and didn't go there."



"If he took the other road, where would he go?" asked Mr. Damon.



"Any one of a dozen places. I guess we'll have to follow the trail and
make all the inquiries we can."



But from the point where the two roads branched, all trace of Tom Swift
was lost. No one had seen him in his machine, though he was known to
more than one resident along the highway.



"Well, what are we going to do?" asked Mr. Damon, after they had
traveled some distance and had obtained no news.



"Suppose we call up his home," suggested Ned, as they came to a country
store where there was a telephone. "It may be he has returned. In that
case, all our worry has gone for nothing."



"I don't believe it has," said Mr. Damon. "But if we call up and ask if
Tom is back it will show we haven't found him, and his father will be
more worried than ever."



"We can ask the telephone girl, and tell her to keep quiet about it,"
decided Ned; and this they did.



But the answer that came back over the wire was discouraging. For Tom
had not returned, and there was no word from him. There was an urgent
message for him, too, from government officials regarding the tank, the
girl reported.



"Well, we've just got to find him&mdash;that's all!" declared Ned. "I guess
we'll have to make a regular search of it. I did hope we'd find him out
at the Kanker farm. But since he isn't there, nor anywhere about, as
far as we can tell, we've got to try some other plan."



"You mean notify the authorities?"&mdash;asked Mr. Damon.



"Hardly that&mdash;yet. But I'll get some of Tom's friends who have
machines, and we'll start them out on the trail. In that way we can
cover a lot of ground."



Late that afternoon, and far into the night, a number of the friends of
Tom and Ned went about the country in automobiles, seeking news of the
young inventor. Mr. Swift became very anxious over the non-return of
his son, and felt the authorities should be notified; but as all agreed
that the local police could not handle the matter and that it would
have to be put into the hands of the United States Secret Service, he
consented to wait for a while before doing this.



All the next day the search was kept up, and Ned and Mr. Damon were
getting discouraged, not to say alarmed, when, most unexpectedly, they
received a clew.



They had been traveling around the country on little-frequented roads
in the hope that perhaps Tom might have taken one and disabled his
machine so that he was unable to proceed.



"Though in that case he could, and would, have sent word," said Ned.



"Unless he's hurt," suggested Mr. Damon.



"Well, maybe that is what's happened," Ned was saying, when they
noticed coming toward them a very much dilapidated automobile, driven
by a farmer, and on the seat beside him was a small, barefoot boy.



"Which is the nearest road to Shopton?" asked the man, bringing his
wheezing machine to a stop.



"Who are you looking for in Shopton?" asked Ned, while a strange
feeling came over him that, somehow or other, Tom was concerned in the
question.



"I'm looking for friends of a Tom Swift," was the answer.



"Tom Swift? Where is he? What's happened to him?" cried Ned.



"Bless my dyspepsia tablets!" exclaimed Mr. Damon. "Do you know where
he is?"



"Not exactly," answered the farmer; "but here's a note from some one
that signs himself 'Tom Swift,' and it says he's a prisoner!"






Chapter XXII



Rescued



For a moment Ned and Mr. Damon gazed at the farmer in his rattletrap of
an auto, and then they looked at the fluttering piece of paper in his
hand. Thence their gaze traveled to the ragged and barefoot lad sitting
beside the farmer.



"I found it!" announced the boy.



"Found what?" asked Ned.



"That there note!"



Without asking any more questions, reserving them until they knew more
about the matter, Mr. Damon and Ned each reached out a hand for the
paper the farmer held. The latter handed it to Ned, being nearest him,
and at a sight of the handwriting the young bank clerk exclaimed:



"It's from Tom, all right!"



"What happened to him?" cried Mr. Damon. "Where is he? Is he a
prisoner?"



"So it seems," answered Ned. "Wait, I'll read it to you," and he read:






"'Whoever picks this up please send word at once to Mr. Swift or to Ned
Newton in Shopton, or to Mr. Damon of Waterfield. I am a prisoner,
locked in the old factory. Tom Swift'."






"Bless my quinine pills!" cried Mr Damon. "What in the world does it
mean?  What factory?"



"That's just what we've got to find out," decided Ned.  "Where did you
get this?" he asked the farmer's boy.



"Way off over there," and he pointed across miles of fields. "I was
lookin' for a lost cow, and I went past an old factory. There wasn't
nobody in the place, as far as I knowed, but all at once I heard some
one yell, and then I seen something white, like a bird, sail out of a
high window. I was scared for a minute, thinkin' it might be tramps
after me."



"And what did you do, Sonny?" asked Mr. Damon, as the boy paused.



"Well, after a while I went to where the white thing lay, and I picked
it up. I seen it was a piece of paper, with writin' on it, and it was
wrapped around part of a brick."



"And did you go near the factory to find out who called or who threw
the paper out?" Ned queried.



"I didn't," the boy answered. "I was scared. I went home, and didn't
even start to find the lost cow.



"No more he did," chimed in the farmer. "He come runnin' in like a
whitehead, and as soon as I saw the paper and heard what Bub had to
say, I thought maybe I'd better do somethin'."



"Did you go to the factory?" asked Ned eagerly.



"No. I thought the best thing to do would be to find this Mr. Swift, or
the other folks mentioned in this letter. I knowed, in a general way,
where Shopton was, but I'd never been there, doing my tradin' in the
other direction, and so I had to stop and ask the road. If you can tell
me&mdash;"



"We're two of the persons spoken of in that note," said Mr. Damon, as
he mentioned his name and introduced Ned. "We have been looking for our
friend Tom Swift for two days now.  We must find him at once, as there
is no telling what he may be suffering."



"Where is this old factory you speak of," continued Mr. Damon, "and how
can we get there? It's too bad one of you didn't go back, after finding
the note, to tell Tom he was soon to be rescued."



"Waal, maybe it is," said the farmer, a bit put out by the criticism.
"But I figgered it would be better to look up this young man's friends
and let them do the rescuin', and not lose no time, 'specially as it's
about as far from my place to the factory as it is to Shopton."



"Well, I suppose that's so," agreed Ned. "But what is this factory?"



"It's an old one where they started to make beet sugar, but it didn't
pan out," the farmer said. "The place is in ruins, and I did hear, not
long ago, that somebody run a threshin' machine through it, an' busted
it up worse than before."



"Great horned toads!" cried Ned. "That must be the very factory Tom ran
his tank through. And to think he should be a prisoner there!"



"Held by whom, do you suppose?" asked Mr. Damon.



"By that Blakeson gang, I imagine," Ned answered. "There's no time to
lose. We must go to his rescue!"



"Of course!" agreed Mr. Damon. "We're much obliged to you for bringing
this note," he went on to the farmer. "And here is something to repay
you for your trouble," and he took out his wallet.



"Shucks! I didn't do this for pay!" objected the farmer.  "It's a pity
I wouldn't help anybody what's in trouble!  If I'd a-knowed what it
meant, me and Bub here would have gone to the factory ourselves, maybe,
and done the work quicker.  But I didn't know&mdash;what with war times and
such-like&mdash;but that it would be better to deliver the note."



"It turns out as well, perhaps," agreed Ned. "We'll look after Tom now."



"And I'll come along and help," said the farmer. "If there's a gang of
tramps in that factory, you may need some reinforcements. I've got a
couple of new axe handles in my machine, and they'll come in mighty
handy as clubs."



"That's so," said Mr. Damon. "But I fancy Tom is simply locked in the
deserted factory office, with no one on guard.  We can get him out once
we get there, and we'll be glad to have you come with us. So if you
won't take any reward, maybe your boy will, as he found the note," and
Mr. Damon pressed some bills into the hands of the boy, who, it is
needless to say, was glad to get them.



It was a run of several miles back to the deserted factory, and though
they passed houses on the way, it was decided that no addition to their
force was necessary, though they did stop at a blacksmith shop, where
they borrowed a heavy sledge to batter down a door if such action
should be needed.



The farmer's rattletrap of a car, in spite of its appearance, was not
far behind Ned's runabout, and in a comparatively short time all were
within sight of the ruined place&mdash;a ruin made more complete by the
passage through it of Tom Swift's war tank.



"And to think of his being there all this while!" exclaimed Mr. Damon,
as he and Ned leaped from their machine.



"If he only is there!" murmured the young bank clerk.



"What do you mean? Didn't the note he threw out say he was there?"



"Yes, but something may have happened in the meanwhile.  Those
plotters, if they'd do a thing like this, are capable of anything. They
may have kidnapped Tom again."



"Anyway, we'll soon find out," murmured Ned, as they advanced toward
the ruin, Mr. Damon and the farmer each armed with an axe helve, while
Ned carried the blacksmith's sledge.



They went into the end of the factory that was less ruined than the
central part, where the tank had crashed through, and made their way
into what had been the office&mdash;the place where they had found the
burned scraps of paper.



"Hark!" exclaimed Ned, as they climbed up the broken steps. "I heard a
noise."



"It's him yellin'&mdash;like he did afore he threw out the note," said the
boy. Then, as they listened, they heard a distant voice calling:



"Hello! Hello, there! If that is any friend of mine, let me out, or
send word to Mr. Damon or Ned Newton! Hello!"



"Hello yourself, Tom Swift!" yelled Ned, too delighted to wait for any
other confirmation that it was his friend who was shouting. "We've come
to rescue you, Tom!"



There was a moment of silence, and then a voice asked:



"Who is there?"



"Ned Newton, Mr. Damon, and some other friends of yours!" answered the
young bank clerk, for surely the farmer and his son could be called
Tom's friends.



An indistinguishable answer came back, and then Ned cried:



"Where are you, Tom? Tell us, so we can get you out!"



They all listened, and faintly heard:



"I'm in some sort of an old vault, partly underground.  It's below what
used to be the office. There's a flight of steps, but be careful, as
they're rotten."



Eagerly they looked around  Mr. Damon saw a door in one corner of the
office, and tried to open it. It was locked, but a few blows from the
sledge smashed it, and then some steps were revealed.



Down these, using due caution, went Ned and the others, and at the
bottom they came upon another door. This was of sheet iron and was
fastened on the outside by a big padlock.



"Stand back!" cried Ned, as he swung the sledge, and with a few blows
broke the lock to pieces.



Then they pulled open the door, and into the light staggered Tom Swift,
a most woe-begone figure, and showing the effects of his imprisonment.
But he was safe and unharmed, though much disheveled from his attempts
to escape.



"Thank Heaven, you've come!" he murmured, as he clasped Ned's hand. "Is
the tank all right?"



"All right!" cried Ned. "And now tell us about yourself.  How in the
world did you get here?"



"It's quite a yarn," answered Tom. "I've got to pull myself together
before I answer," and he sank wearily down on a step, looking very
haggard and worn.






Chapter XXIII



Gone



"Here, eat some of this," and Ned held something out to his chum.
"It'll bring you up quicker than anything else, except a cup of hot
tea, and we'll get that as soon as you can get away from here," went on
the young bank clerk.



"What is it?" Tom asked, and his voice was very weary.



"It's a mixture of chocolate and nuts," replied Ned. "It's a new form
of emergency ration issued to soldiers before they go over the top. Our
Y.M.C.A. is sending a lot to the boys from around here who are in
France. I was helping pack the boxes ready for shipment, and I kept out
some to show you. Lucky I had it with me. Eat it, and you'll feel a lot
better in a few minutes. You haven't had much to eat, have you?"



"Very little," answered Tom, as he nibbled half-heartedly at the
confection Ned gave him, while Mr. Damon went out to the automobile and
came back with a thermos bottle filled with cool water. He always
provided himself with this on taking an automobile trip.



Tom managed to eat some of the chocolate, and then took a drink of the
cool water. In a little while he declared that he felt better.



"Then come out of here!" exclaimed Ned. "You can tell us how it all
happened and what they did to you. But I can see that last&mdash;they
treated you like a dog, didn't they?"



"Pretty nearly," answered Tom; "but they didn't have things all their
own way. I think I made one or two of them remember me," and he glanced
at his swollen and bruised hands. Indeed, he bore the marks of having
been in a fierce fight.



"Are you sure the tank's all right?" he asked Ned again.  "That has
been worrying me more than my own condition. I could think of only one
reason why they got me here and held me prisoner, and that was to get
me out of the way while they captured my tank. Then they haven't got
her?" he asked eagerly.



"Not a look at her," Ned answered. "She was safe in the shop when we
set out this morning."



"And now it's late afternoon," murmured Tom. "Well, I hope nothing has
happened since," and there was vague alarm in his voice, an alarm at
which Ned and Mr. Damon wondered.



"Couldn't you stop at some farmhouse and get fixed up a little?" asked
Mr. Kimball, the farmer who had brought the note to Ned and Mr. Damon.



"I need to get fixed up somewhere," replied Tom, with a rueful look at
himself&mdash;his hands, his torn clothes, and his general dilapidated
appearance. "But I don't want to lose any time. I'm afraid something
has happened at home, Ned."



"Nonsense! How could there, with Koko on guard, to say nothing of
Eradicate!"



"Well, maybe you're right," agreed Tom; "but I'll feel better when I
see my tank in her shed. Let's have some more of that concentrated
porterhouse steak of yours, Ned. It is good, and it fills out my
stomach, which was getting more intimate with my backbone than I liked
to feel."



More of the really good confection and another drink of refreshing
water made Tom feel better, and he was soon able to walk along without
staggering from weakness.



"And now let's get out of here," advised Ned, "unless you've left
something back in that vault you want, Tom," and he motioned to his
chum's late prison.



"Nothing there but bad memories," was the reply, with a rueful smile.
"I'm as ready to go as you are, Ned. It was good of you and Mr. Damon
to come for me, and you"&mdash;and he looked questioningly at Mr. Kimball.



"If it hadn't been for Mr. Kimball and his boy, we wouldn't have found
you&mdash;at least so soon," said Ned, and he told of the finding of the
note and what had followed.



"That's the only way I could think of for getting help," said Tom.
"They took every scrap of paper from me, but I found some in the lining
of my hat&mdash;some I'd stuffed in after I had a hair cut and my hat was
too large. For a pencil I used burnt matches. Oh, but I'm glad to be
out!" and he breathed deep of the fresh air.



"How did you get in there?" asked Ned wonderingly.



"Those fellows&mdash;of course. The German plotters, I'm going to call them,
for I believe that Blakeson and his gang&mdash;though I didn't see him&mdash;are
really working in the interests of Germany to get the secret of my
tank."



"Well, they haven't got her yet," said Ned, "and they're not likely to
now. Go on, Tom, if you feel able tell us in a few words what happened.
We've been trying to think, but can't."



"Well, it all happened because I didn't think enough," said Tom, who
was rapidly recovering his strength and nerve.  "When I got that
message that seemed to come from you, Ned, I should have known better
than to take a chance. But it seemed genuine, and as I had no reason to
suspect a trap, I started off at once. I thought maybe Kanker had
repented and was going to make amends for all the trouble he caused.



"Anyhow, I started off in my machine, and I hadn't got more than to the
crossroads when I saw a fellow out tinkering with his auto. Of course I
stopped to ask if I could help, for I can't bear to see any machinery
out of order, and as I was stooping over the engine to see what was
wrong I was pounced on from behind, bound and tied, and before I could
do a thing I was bundled into the car&mdash;a big limousine, and taken away.



"The crossroads was as far as we could trace you," remarked Ned.



"Well, it wasn't as far as they took me, by any means," Tom said. "They
brought me here, took me out of the machine&mdash;and I noticed that they'd
brought mine along&mdash;and then they carted me into the vault.



"But they didn't have it all their own way," said Tom grimly. "I
managed to get the ropes loose, and I had a regular knock down and drag
out with them for a while. But they were too many for me, and locked me
up in that place after taking away everything I had in my pockets."



"Were they highwaymen?" asked Mr. Kimtall.



"No, for they tossed back my money, watch and some trifles like that,"
Tom answered. "I didn't recognize any of the men, though one of them
must have known me, for when they had me tied I heard one of them ask
if I was the right party, and another said I was. I know they must
belong to the same gang that Simpson, Blakeson, and Schwen are members
of&mdash;the German spies."



"But what was their object?" asked Ned. "Did they try to force you to
tell them the secrets of the tank?"



"No; and that's the funny part which makes me so suspicious," Tom
answered. "If they'd tried to force something out of me, I would
understand it better. But they just kept me a prisoner after taking
away what papers I had."



"Were they of any value?" asked Mr. Damon.



"Not as regards the tank. That is, there was nothing of my plans of
construction, control or anything like that, though there was some
foreign correspondence that I am sorry fell into their hands. However,
that can't be helped."



"And did they just keep you locked up?" asked Ned.



"That's about all they did. After the fight&mdash;and it was some fight!"
declared Tom, as he recalled it with a shake of his head&mdash;"they left me
here with the door shut. There must have been some one on guard, for I
could faintly hear somebody moving about.



"I tried to get out, of course, but I couldn't. That vault must have
been made to hold something very valuable, for it was almost as strong
and solid as one in your bank, Ned.  The only window was placed so high
that I couldn't reach it, and it was barred at that.



"They opened the door a little, several times, to toss in once some old
bags that I made into a bed, and next they gave me a little water and
some sandwiches&mdash;German bologna sausage sandwiches, Ned! What do you
think of that&mdash;adding insult to injury?"



"That was tough!" Ned admitted.



"Well, I had to put up with it, for I was half starved, and as sore as
a boil from the fight. I didn't know what to do. I knew that you'd miss
me sooner or later, and set out to find me, but I hardly thought you'd
think of this place.  They couldn't have picked out a much better
prison to hold me, for, naturally, you wouldn't suppose enough of it
was left standing, after my tank had walked through it, to make a
hiding place.



"However, there was, and here I've been kept. At last I thought of the
plan of sending out a message on the scrap of paper I could tear out of
my hat. So I wrote it, and after several trials I managed to toss it
out of the window. Then I just had to wait, and that was the hardest of
all. The last twelve hours I've been without food, and I haven't heard
any one around, so I guess they've skipped out and don't intend to come
back."



"We didn't see any one," Ned reported. "Maybe they became frightened,
Tom."



"I wish I could think that," was the answer. "What is more likely to be
the case is that they're up to some new tricks.  I must get back home
quickly."



And after a stop had been made at a farmhouse belonging to a business
acquaintance of Ned's, where Tom was able to wash and get a cup of hot
tea, which added to his recuperative powers, the young inventor, with
Ned and Mr. Damon, set out for Shopton.



Before Mr. Kimball started for his home, renewed thanks had been made
to the farmer and his son for the part they had played in the rescue,
and the young inventor, learning that the boy had a liking for things
mechanical, promised to aid him in his intention to become a machinist.



"But first get a good education," Tom advised. "Keep on with your
school work, and when the time comes I'll take you into my shop."



"And maybe he'll make a tank that will rival yours, Tom," said Ned.



"Maybe he will! I hope he does. If he comes along fast enough, he can
help with something else I'm going to start soon."



"Whats that?" asked Mr. Damon.



"Oh, it's something on the same order, designed to help batter down the
German lines," Tom answered. "I haven't quite made up my mind what to
call it yet. But let's get home. I want to see that my tank is safe.
The absence of the plotters from the factory makes me suspicious."



On the way back Tom told more of the details of the attack.



"But we'll forget about it all, now you're out," remarked Ned.



"And the sooner we get home, the better," added Tom. "Can't you get a
little more speed out of this machine?" he asked.



"Well, it isn't the Hawk," replied Ned, "but we'll see what we can do,"
and he made the runabout fairly fly.



Mrs. Baggert was the first to greet Tom as they arrived at his home.
She did not seem as surprised as either Tom, Ned or Mr. Damon expected
her to be.



"Well, I'm glad you're all right," she said. "And it's a good thing you
sent that note, for your father was so excited and worried I was
getting apprehensive about him."



"What note?" asked Tom, while a queer look came into his face.



"Why, the one you sent saying you were detained on business and would
probably not be home for a week, and to have Koku and the men bring the
tank to you."



"Bring the tank! A note from me!" exclaimed Tom. "The plotters again!
And they've got the tank!"



He ran to the big shop followed by the others. Throwing open the doors,
they went inside. A glance sufficed to disclose the worst.



The place where the great tank had stood was empty.



"Gone!" gasped Tom.






Chapter XXIV



Camouflaged



Two utterances Tom Swift made when the fact of the disappearance of the
tank became known to him were characteristic of the young inventor. The
first was:



"How did they get it away?"



And the second was:



"Come on, let's get after 'em!"



Then, for a few moments, no one said anything. Tom, Ned, and Mr. Damon,
with Mrs. Baggert in the background, stood looking at the great empty
machine shop.



"Well, they got her," went on Tom, with a sigh. "I was afraid of this
as soon as they left me alone at the factory."



"Is anything wrong?" faltered the housekeeper. "Didn't you send for the
tank, Tom?"



"No, Mrs. Baggert, I didn't," Tom answered.



"But I don't understand," the housekeeper said. "A man came with a note
from you, Tom, and in it you said to have him take the tank, with Koku
and the men who know how to run it. We were so glad to hear from you,
and know that you were all right, that we didn't think of anything
else, your father and I. So he went out and saw that the tank got off
all right. Koku was glad, for it's the first chance he'd had to ride in
it."



"Who was the man who brought the note?" asked Tom, and he was striving
to be calm. "To think of poor old dad playing right into the hands of
the plotters!" he added, in an aside to Ned.



"Well, I don't know who the man was," said Mrs. Baggert.  "He seemed
all right, and of course having a note from you&mdash;"



"Who has that note now?" asked Tom quickly.



"Your father."



"Come on," and Tom led the way back to the house. "I'll have a look at
that document, which of course I never wrote, and then we'll get after
the plotters and the tank."



"She ought to be easy to trace," observed Mr. Damon.  "Bless my
fountain pen, but she ought to be easy to trace!  She will leave a
track like a giant boa constrictor crawling along."



"Yes, I guess we can trace her, all right," assented Tom Swift; "but
the point is, will there be anything left of her? What's what I'm
afraid of now."



Mr. Swift was still excited, but his worry had subsided as soon as he
knew Tom was safe.



"The whole thing is a forgery, but fairly well done," Tom said, as he
looked at the paper his father gave him&mdash;a brief note stating that Tom
was well, but detained on business, and that the tank was to be brought
to him, just where the bearer of the note would indicate. Koku, the
giant, and several of the machinists, who knew how to operate the big
machine, were to go with it, the note said.



"That made me sure everything was all right," said Mr. Swift. "I knew,
of course, Tom, that plotters might try to get hold of your war secret,
but I didn't see how they could if Koku and some of your own men were
in possession."



"They couldn't&mdash;as long as they remained in possession," Tom said. "But
that's the trouble. I'm afraid they haven't.  What has probably
happened is that under the direction of this man, who brought the
forged note from me, Koku and the others took the tank where he
directed them, thinking to meet me. Then, reaching the place where the
rest of the plotters were concealed, they overpowered Koku and the
others and took possession of the machine."



"They'd have trouble with Koku," suggested Ned.



"Yes, but even a giant can't fight too big a crowd, especially if he is
taken by surprise, and that's probably what happened," remarked Tom.
"Now the question is where is the tank, and how can we get her back?
Every minute counts.  If those German spies and their helpers remain in
possession long, they'll find out enough of my secrets to enable them
to duplicate the machine, and especially some of the most exclusive
features. We've got to get after 'em!"



"They imitated your writing pretty well, Tom," Observed Ned, as he
looked at the forged note.



"Yes; that's why they took all my papers away from me&mdash;to get specimens
of my handwriting. I half suspected that, but I didn't quite figure out
what their game was. Well, we know the worst now, and that's better
than working in the dark.  Now I'm going to have a bath and get into
some decent clothes, and we'll see what we can do."



"Count on me, Tom!" exclaimed Ned. "I'll go the limit with you!"



"I knew you would, old man!"



"And me, too!" cried Mr. Damon. "Bless my open fireplace, but I'll send
word to my wife that I'm not coming home to-night, and we can start the
first thing in the morning, Tom."



"Yes; there isn't much use in going now, as it will soon be dark."



"How are you going to trace the tank, Tom?" asked Ned, when his chum
had bathed and gotten into fresh clothes.



"I'm going to tour the country around here in an auto. The tank can
make ten miles an hour, but that's nothing to what an auto can do. And
we oughtn't to have much trouble in tracing her. No one whose house she
passed would forget her in a hurry."



"That's so," agreed Ned. "But if they took her across country&mdash;"



"A different story," agreed Tom. "Come to think of it, maybe we'd
better start to-night, Ned. We can make inquiries after dark as well as
by daylight and get ready for an early morning hunt."



"Let's do it, then!" suggested his chum. "I'm ready. I'll send word
that I'll not be home to-night."



"Good!" cried the young inventor. "We'll have an old-fashioned hunt
after our enemies, Ned!"



"And don't leave me out!" begged Mr. Damon. Hurried preparations were
made for the night trip. Tom ordered out one of his speediest, though
not largest, automobiles, and told his helper to get the Hawk ready, to
have her so she could start at a moment's notice if needed.



"You're not going in her, are you, Tom?" asked Ned.



"I may need her to-morrow for daylight hunting. If the tank's hidden
somewhere, I can spot her from above more easily than from the ground.
So if we get any trace of my machine, I can phone in and have the
aeroplane brought to me."



"That's a good idea!"



Inquiry at the shop where the tank had been built and kept disclosed
the fact that, in addition to Koku, three of Tom's men had gone in her
to help manage the machine under the direction of the man who bore the
forged note. That he was one of the plotters not hitherto observed by
either Ned or Tom seemed certain.



"And they took Koku and some of the men merely to make it look natural
and as if it were all right," Tom said.  "Naturally that deceived my
father, who thought, of course, that I was waiting for the machine.
Well, it was a slick trick, Ned, but we may fool them yet."



"I hope so, Tom."



Night had fully fallen when Tom, Ned, and Mr. Damon started away in the
touring car.



Out onto the road rolled the automobile. During the little daylight
that had remained after his arrival at home and following the discovery
of the loss of the tank Tom and Ned had traced it, by the marks of the
big steel caterpillar belts, to the main road. It had gone along that
some distance, just how far could not be said.



"But by using the searchlight of the auto we can trace her as long as
they keep her on the road," said Tom. "After that we'll have to trust
to luck, and to what inquiries we can make."



The touring car carried a powerful lamp, and by its gleams it was easy
to trace for a time the progress of the ponderous tank. There was no
need to make inquiries of persons living along the way, though once or
twice Tom did get out to ask, confirming the fact that the big machine
had rumbled past in a direction away from the Swift home.



"I had an idea they might have doubled on their tracks for a time, and
backed her up just to fool us," Tom said. "They might do that, keeping
her in the same tracks."



But this, evidently, had not been done, and the tank was making good
speed away from the Swift house. They kept up the search until about
midnight, and then a heavy rain began just before they reached a point
where several roads branched.



"Luck's with them!" exclaimed Tom. "This will wash away the marks, and
we'll have to go it blind. Might as well put up here for the night," he
added, as they came to a village hotel.



It was evident that little more could be done in the rain and darkness,
and there was danger of over-running the trail of the tank if they kept
on. So they turned in at the hotel and got what little rest they could
in their anxious state of minds.



Tom tried to be cheerful and to look for the best, but it was hard
work. The tank was his pet invention, and, moreover, that her secrets
should fall into the hands of the enemy and be used for Germany and
against the United States eventually, made the young inventor feel that
everything was going wrong.



The rain kept up all night, and this would make it correspondingly hard
for them to pick up the trail in the morning.



"The only thing we can do is to make inquiries," decided Tom.
"Fortunately, the tank can't easily be hidden."



They started off after an early breakfast. The roads were so muddy and
wet that traveling was difficult and dangerous for the automobile, and
they were disappointed in finding no one who had seen or heard the tank
pass up to a point not far from the hotel where they had stayed
overnight. From then on the big machine seemed to have disappeared.



"I know what they've done," Tom said, when noon came and they had found
no trace of the ponderous war machine.  "They've left the road and
taken her cross country, and we can't find the spot where they did this
because the rain has washed out the marks. Well, there's only one thing
left to do."



"What's that?" asked Ned.



"Get the Hawk! In that we can look down and over a big extent of
country. That's what I'll do&mdash;I'll phone for the airship. The rain is
stopping, I think."



The rain did cease by the time one of Tom's men brought the speedy
aircraft to the place named by the young inventor in his telephone
message. There were still several hours of daylight left, and Tom
counted on them to allow him to rise in the air and look down on the
tanks possible hiding place.



"One thing's sure," he told Ned: "I know the limit of her speed, and
she can't be farther off than at some place within a circle of about
one hundred and twenty-five miles from my house. And it's in the
direction we're in. So if I circle around up above, I may spot her."



"I hope so," murmured Ned.



It was arranged that Mr. Damon should take the automobile back, with
Tom's mechanician in it, and Tom and Ned would scout around in the
aircraft, which carried only two.



"You ought to have a machine gun with you, Tom, if you plan to attack
those fellows to get back the tank," Ned said.



"Oh, I don't imagine I'll need it," he said. "Anyhow, a machine gun
wouldn't be of much effect against the tank. And they can't fire on us,
for there wasn't any ammunition for the guns in Tank A, unless they got
some of their own, and I hardly believe they'd do that. I'll take a
chance, anyhow."



And so the search from the air began. It was disappointing at first.
Around and around circled Tom and Ned, their eyes peering eagerly down
from the heights for a sight of the tank, possibly hidden in some
little-known ravine or gully.



Back and forth, like a speck in the sky, Tom guided the Hawk, while Ned
took observation after observation with the binoculars.



At last, when the low-sinking sun gave warning that night would soon be
upon them, Ned's glasses picked up something on the ground far below
that made him sit suddenly straighter in his seat.



"What is it?" asked Tom through the speaking apparatus, feeling the
movement on the part of his chum.



"I see something down there, Tom," was the answer. "It doesn't look
like the tank, and yet it doesn't look as a clump of trees and bushes
ought to look. Have a peep yourself. It's just beyond that river,
against the side of the hill&mdash;a lonesome place, too."



Tom took the glasses while Ned assumed control of the Hawk, there being
a dual system for operating and steering her.



No sooner had the young inventor got the focus on what Ned had
indicated than he gave a cry.



"What is it?" asked the young bank clerk.



"Camouflaged!" cried Tom, and without stopping to explain what he
meant, he handed the binoculars back to Ned and began to guide the Hawk
down toward the earth at high speed.






Chapter XXV



Foiled



"Is it really Tank A, Tom?" cried Ned, through the tube, as soon as he
became aware of his companion's intention.  "Are you sure?"



"That's the girl, and just where you spotted her with the glasses&mdash;in
that clump of bushes. But they've daubed her with green and brown
paint&mdash;camouflaged her, so to speak&mdash;until she looks like part of the
landscape. What made you suspicious of that particular place?"



"The green was such a bright one in contrast to the rest of the foliage
around it.'



"That's what struck me," Tom answered, as he continued to drive the
Hawk earthward. "They thought they were doing a smart trick&mdash;imitating
the tactics of the Allies with their tanks&mdash;but they must be color
blind."



Ned took another observation through the glasses. He could see the tank
more easily now. There she was, fairly well hidden in a clump of bushes
and small trees on the banks of a river, about a hundred miles away
from Shopton. It was in a wild and desolate country, and only with the
airship could the trail have thus been followed.



Ned saw that the tank had been daubed with green, yellow, and brown
paint, in fantastic blotches, to make the big machine blend with the
foliage; and, to a certain extent, this had been accomplished.



But, as Ned had remarked, the green used was of too vivid a hue. No
natural tree put forth leaves like that, and the glass had further
revealed the error.



"Look, Tom!" suddenly cried Ned. "She's moving!"



"You're right!" answered the young inventor. "They've seen us and are
trying to get away."



"But they can't beat your airship, Tom."



"I know that. But their game&mdash;Oh, Ned, they're going to wreck her!"
cried Tom, and there was anguish in his voice.



As the two looked down from their seats In the Hawk they saw the tank,
in its fantastic dress of splotchy paint, leave her lair amid the
bushes and trees, and head toward the river. Like some ponderous
prehistoric monster about to take a drink, she careened her way toward
the stream, which, at this point, ran between high banks.



"What's the game?" cried Ned.



"They're going to send her to smash!" cried Tom. "She's pretty tough,
Tom, but she'll never stand a tumble down into the river without
breaking a lot of machinery inside her."



"But if they demolish the tank they'll kill themselves, won't they?
And Koku and your men, too, who must be prisoners in her!"



"They won't risk their own worthless hides, you may be sure of that!"
exclaimed Tom.



"There they go, but they must have left Koku and the others to their
fate!"



"Oh, if they could only get loose and take control now, Tom, they'd
save your tank for you!" shouted Ned.



"Yes; but they can't, I'm afraid. They may be killed, or so securely
bound that they can't get loose!"



"Can't you get the Hawk there in time to stop her?"



"I'm afraid not. By that time she'll have attained top speed and it
would be taking our lives in our hands to try to make a flying jump,
get inside, and shut off the motors."



"Then the tank's got to smash!" said Ned gloomily.



Tom did not answer for a moment. He and his chum watched the fleeing
figures running away from the war engine. What the plotters had done,
as soon as they saw the aircraft and realized that Tom had discovered
them, was to start the motors and leap from the tank, closing the doors
after them.  Whether or not they had left Koku and the others prisoners
inside remained to be seen.



But the tank was plunging her way toward the steep bank of the river,
doomed, it seemed, to great damage, if not to destruction.



"Oh, if we could only halt her!" murmured Ned.



Tom Swift was busy with some apparatus on the Hawk. Ned heard the hum
of an electric motor which was connected with the engine, and there
soon sounded the crackle of the wireless.



"What are you doing? Signaling for help from those inside the tank?"
asked Ned, for the big machine was fitted to receive and send messages
of this sort.



"I'm trying something more desperate than that," Tom answered.



Again the wireless crackled, Tom working it with one hand while, with
the other, he guided the aircraft. Ned looked downward with wondering
eyes.



The tank was still plunging her way toward the steep bank of the river.
If she tumbled down this, there would be little left of the expensive
and complicated machinery inside.



"The rascals did their work well," mused Ned. "They've probably gotten
all the secrets they want and now they're going to spoil all Tom's hard
work. It's a shame! If only&mdash;"



Ned ceased his musing. Something was taking place down below that he
could not explain. The tank seemed to be slackening her progress. More
and more slowly she approached the edge of the cliff.



"Tom! Tom!" yelled Ned. "You must have waked some of them up inside and
they've thrown the motors out of gear! Hurrah!  She's stopping!"



"I believe she is!" yelled Tom. "Oh, if it only works!"



The tank was still moving, though more slowly. Still the crackle of the
wireless was heard.



And then, just as Tom shut off his own motor and let the Hawk glide on
her downward way in a volplane to earth, the great, ponderous tank came
to a stop, on the very edge of the precipice at the foot of which
rolled the river.



"Whew!" whistled Ned, as the aircraft rolled along the ground near the
war machine. "That was touch and go, Tom!  They stopped her just in
time."



"You mean the wireless stopped her," said Tom quietly.  "I'm very much
afraid that if Koku and the others are alive they're still prisoners in
the craft."



"The wireless!" gasped Ned, as he and his chum got out of the Hawk. "Do
you mean that you stopped her by wireless, Tom?"



"That's what I did. It was a desperate chance, but I took it. I had
just installed in the tank a system of wireless control, so she could
be guided as some torpedos and submarines are, by wireless impulses
from the shore.



"Only I'd never given the tank system a tryout. It was all installed,
and had worked perfectly on the small model I constructed. And when I
saw her running away, out of control as she was, I realized the
wireless was the only thing that would stop her, if that would. It
might operate just opposite to what I wanted, though, and increase her
speed."



"But I took the chance. I set the airship wireless current to working,
and tuned it in to coincide with the control of the tank. Then, by
means of the wireless impulse I shut off the motors, which can be
stopped or started by hand or by electricity. I shut 'em off."



"And only just in time!" cried Ned. "Whew, Tom Swift, but that was a
close call!"



"I realize that myself!" said the young inventor. "This is a new idea
and has to be worked out further for our newer tanks."



"Gee!" ejaculated Ned. "Out of date before got into use!  Now let's see
about our friends!"



It was the work of but a moment to enter the tank, and, after making
sure that the machinery was all right, Tom and Ned made their way to
the interior. In one of the smallest rooms they found Koku and the
others bound with ropes, and in a bad way. Koku was so tied with cords
and hemp as to resemble a bale of Manilla cable.



"Cut 'em loose, Ned!" cried Tom, and the bonds were soon severed. Then
came explanations.



As has been told, one of the plotters, whose identity was not learned
until later, came with the forged note. The giant and Tom's men set out
in the tank, and the machine was stopped at a certain place where the
plotter, who gave the name of Crossleigh, told them Tom was to meet his
men.



Out of ambush leaped Simpson and others, who overpowered the mechanics,
even subduing Koku after a fierce fight, and then they took possession
of the tank, making the others prisoners.



What happened after that could only be conjectured by Tom's men, for
they were shut up in an inner room. It seemed certain, though, that the
tank was taken to some secret place and there painted to resemble the
verdure. Then she went on again, coming to rest where Tom and Ned saw
her.



Meanwhile the plotters were gradually getting at the secrets of
construction, and they were in the midst of this work when one of them
saw the aeroplane. Rightly guessing what it portended, they left
hurriedly, still leaving the hapless men bound, and started the tank on
what they thought would be her last trip.



"But you saved her, Tom!" cried Ned. "You saved her with the wireless."



And word was sent back to Shopton by the same means to tell Mr. Swift,
Mr. Damon, and the others that Tom and his tank were safe. And then, a
little later, when the bound men had recovered the use of their cramped
limbs, the tank was backed away from the ledge and started on her
homeward way, Tom and Ned preceding her in the Hawk.



Without further incident, save a slight break which was soon repaired,
Tank A soon reached her harbor again, and a double guard was posted
about the shop.



"And they won't get much more chance to steal her secrets," said Tom
that night, when the stories had been told.



"Why?" asked Ned.



"We start to dismantle her at once," Tom answered, "and she goes to
England to be reproduced for France."



"If only those plotters haven't stolen the secrets," mused Ned.



But if they had they got little good of them. For shortly afterward
government secret service agents rounded up the chief members of the
gang, including Simpson and Blakeson.  They, with Schwen, were sent to
an internment camp for the period of the war, and enough information
was obtained from them to disclose all the workings of the plot.



"It was just like lots of other stunts the German spies tried to put
over on the good old U.S.A.," said Tom to Ned, the day after the
dismantled tank was shipped to Great Britain. "In some way the spies
found out what I was making, and then they got hold of Blakeson and
Grinder. Those fellows, who so nearly queered me in the big tunnel game
promised to make a tank that would beat those the British at first put
out, and they took some German money in advance for doing it.



"When they found they couldn't make good, the German spies agreed to
help them get possession of my secrets. They worked hard enough at it,
too, but, thanks to you, Ned, and to Eradicate, who gave us the tip on
Schwen, we beat 'em out."



"And so it's all over, Tom?"



"Yes, practically all over. I've given all my interests in the tank to
Uncle Sam. It was the only way I could do my bit, at this time. But
I've something else up my sleeve."



And those of you who care to learn what the young inventor next did may
do so by reading the next volume of this series.



It was about a week after Tank A, as she was still officially called,
had been shipped in sections that Ned Newton called at Tom's home. He
found his chum, with a flower in his buttonhole, about to leave in his
small runabout.



"Oh, excuse me!" exclaimed Ned. "This is Wednesday night.  I might have
known. Give Mary my regards."



"I will," promised Tom, with a smile.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
