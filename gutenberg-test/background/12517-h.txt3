    MR. PUNCH'S PRIZE NOVELS.

    No. VI.       THRUMS ON THE AULD STRING.

    (By J. MUIR KIRRIE, Author of "A
    Door on Thumbs," "Eight Bald Fiddlers" "When a Man Sees
    Double," "My Gentleman Meerschaum,"      c.

    
        [With this story came a glossary of Scotch
        expressions. We have referred to it as we went along, and
        found everything quite intelligible. As, however, we have
        no room to publish the glossary, we can only appeal to the
        indulgence of our readers. The story itself was written in
        a very clear, legible hand, and was enclosed in a wrapper
        labelled, "Arcadia Mixture. Strength and Aroma combined.
        Sold in Six-shilling cases. Special terms for Southrons.
        Liberal allowance for returned empties."]
    

    CHAPTER I.

    We were all sitting on the pig-sty at T'NOWHEAD'S Farm. A
    pig-sty is not, perhaps, a strictly eligible seat, but there
    were special reasons, of which you shall hear something later,
    for sitting on this particular pig-sty.

    The old sow was within, extended at full length.
    Occasionally she grunted approval of what was said, but, beyond
    that, she seemed to show but a faint interest in the
    proceedings. She had been a witness of similar gatherings for
    some years, and, to tell the truth, they had begun to bore her,
    but, on the whole, I am not prepared to deny that her
    appreciation was an intelligent one. Behind us was the brae.
    Ah, that brae! Do you remember how the child you once were sat
    in the brae, spinning the peerie, and hunkering at I-dree
    I-dree I droppit-it? Do you remember that? Do you even know
    what I mean? Life is like that. When we are children the bread
    is thick, and the butter is thin; as we grow to be lads and
    lassies, the bread dwindles, and the butter increases; but the
    old men and women who totter about the commonty, how shall they
    munch when their teeth are gone? That's the question. I'm a
    Dominie. What!       no answer? Go to the bottom of the class,
    all of you.

    CHAPTER II.

    As I said, we were all on the pig-sty. Of the
    habitu        s I scarcely need to speak to you, since
    you must know their names, even if you fail to pronounce them.
    But there was a stranger amongst us, a stranger who, it was
    said, had come from London. Yesterday when I went ben the house
    I found him sitting with JESS; to-day, he too, was sitting with
    us on the pig-sty. There were tales told about him, that he
    wrote for papers in London, and stuffed his vases and his
    pillows with money, but TAMMAS HAGGART only shook his head at
    what he called "such auld fowks' yeppins," and evidently didn't
    believe a single word. Now TAMMAS, you must know, was our
    humorist. It was not without difficulty that TAMMAS had
    attained to this position, and he was resolved to keep it.
    Possibly he scented in the stranger a rival humorist whom he
    would have to crush. At any rate, his greeting was not marked
    with the usual genial cordiality characteristic of Scotch
    weavers, and many were the anxious looks exchanged amongst us,
    as we watched the preparations for the impending conflict.

    CHAPTER III.

    After TAMMAS had finished boring half-a-dozen holes in the
    old sow with his sarcastic eye, he looked up, and addressed
    HENDRY MCQUMPHA.

    "HENDRY," he said, "ye ken I'm a humorist, div ye no?"

    HENDRY scratched the old sow meditatively, before he
    answered.

    "Ou ay," he said, at length. "I'm no saying 'at ye're no a
    humorist. I ken fine ye're a sarcesticist, but there's other
    humorists in the world, am thinkin."

    This was scarcely what TAMMAS had expected. HENDRY was
    usually one of his most devoted admirers. There was an awkward
    silence which made me feel uncomfortable. I am only a poor
    Dominie, but some of my happiest hours had been passed on the
    pig-sty. Were these merry meetings to come to an end? PETE took
    up the talking.

    "HENDRY, my man," he observed, as he helped himself out of
    TAMMAS'S snuff-mull, "ye're ower kyow-owy. Ye ken humour's a
    thing 'at spouts out o' its ain accord, an' there's no nae
    spouter in Thrums 'at can match wi' TAMMAS."

    He looked defiantly at HENDRY, who was engaged in searching
    for coppers in his north-east-by-east-trouser pocket. T'NOWHEAD
    said nothing, and HOOKEY was similarly occupied. At last, the
    stranger spoke.

    "Gentlemen," he began, "may I say a word? I may lay claim to
    some experience in the matter. I travel in humour, and
    generally manage to do a large business."

    He looked round interrogatively. TAMMAS eyed him with one of
    his keen glances. Then he worked his mouth round and round to
    clear the course for a sarcasm.

    "So you're the puir crittur," said the stone-breaker, "'at's
    meanin' to be a humorist."

    This was the challenge. We all knew what it meant, and fixed
    our eyes on the stranger.

    "Certainly," was his answer; "that is exactly my meaning. I
    trust I make myself plain, I'm willing to meet any man at
    catch-weights. Now here, he continued," are some of my samples.
    This story about a house-boat, for instance, has been much
    appreciated. It's almost in the style of Mr. JEROME'S
    masterpiece; or this screamer about my wife's tobacco-pipe and
    the smoking mixture. "Observe," he went on, holding the sample
    near to his mouth, "I can expand it to any extent. Puff, puff!
    Ah! it has burst. No matter, these accidents sometimes happen
    to the best regulated humorists. Now, just look at these," he
    produced half-a-dozen packets rapidly from his bundle. "Here we
    have a packet of sarcasm       equal to dynamite. I left it on
    the steps of the Savile Club, but it missed fire somehow. Then
    here are some particularly neat things in cheques. I use them
    myself to paper my bedroom. It's simpler and easier than
    cashing them, and besides," adjusting his mouth to his sleeve,
    and laughing, "it's quite killing when you come to think of it
    in that way. Lastly, there's this banking-account sample,
    thoroughly suitable for journalists and children. You see how
    it's done. I open it, you draw on it. Oh, you don't want a
    drawing-master, any fellow can do it, and the point is it never
    varies. Now," he concluded, aggressively, "what have you got to
    set against that, my friend?"

    We all looked at TAMMAS. HENDRY kicked the pail towards him,
    and he put his foot on it. Thus we knew that HEHDRY had
    returned to his ancient allegiance, and that the stranger would
    be crushed. Then TAMMAS began       

    "Man, man, there's no nae doubt at ye lauoh at havers, an'
    there's mony 'at lauchs 'at your clipper-clapper, but they're
    no Thrums fowk, and they canna' lauch richt. But we maun juist
    settle this matter. When we're ta'en up wi' the makkin' o'
    humour, we're a' dependent on other fowk to tak' note o' the
    humour. There's no nane o' us 'at's lauched at anything you've
    telt us. But they'll lauch at me. Noo then," he roared out, "'A
    pie sat on a pear-tree.'"

    We all knew this song of TAMMAS'S. A shout of laughter went
    up from the whole gathering. The stranger fell backwards into
    the sty a senseless mass.

    "Man, man," said HOOKEY to TAMMAS, as we walked home; "what
    a crittur ye are! What pit that in your heed?"

    "It juist took a grip o' me," replied TAMMAS, without moving
    a muscle; "it flashed upon me 'at he'd no stand that auld song.
    That's where the humour o' it comes in."

    "Ou, ay," added HENDRY, "Thrums is the place for rale
    humour." On the whole, I agree with him.
    

    SUGGESTIVE.       My Musical Experiences, by BETTINA
    WALKER, will probably be followed by My Eye, by BETTINA
    MARTIN.

        Young Spark. "TRY ME! YOU'VE TOLERATED THAT FUSTY

        Old Flame (aside). "FLASHY YOUNG UPSTART!"

        the surface."       Illustrated London News, on the City
              South London Electric Company.]
    

    "Young Spark"
    loquitur:       

    
        
            Your arm, my dear Madam! This way, down the
            lift, Ma'am!

            No danger at all, no discomfort, no
            dirt!

            You love Sweetness and Light? They are both in my
            gift, Ma'am;

            I'll prove like a shot what I boldly
            assert.

            Don't heed your Old Flame, Ma'am, he's bitterly
            jealous,

            'Tis natural, quite, with his nose out of
            joint;

            You just let him bluster and blow like old
            bellows,

            And try me instead       I
            will not disappoint!

            Old Flame? He's a very fuliginous "Flame,"
            Ma'am;

            I wonder, I'm sure, how you've stood him
            so long;

            He has choked you for years       'tis a thundering
            shame, Ma'am!

            High time the Young Spark put a term to
            his wrong.

            Just look at me! Am I not trim, smart, and
            sparkling,

            As clean as a pin, and as bright as a
            star?

            Compare me with him, who stands scowling and
            darkling!

            So gazed the old gallant on Young
            LOCHINVAR.
        

        
            He's ugly and huffy, and smoky, and stuffy,

            And pokey, and chokey, and black as my
            hat.

            As wooer he's dull, for his breath smells of
            sulphur;

            Asphyxia incarnate, and horrid at
            that!

            You cannot see beauty in one who's so
            sooty,

            So dusty, and dingy, and dismal, and
            dark.

            He's feeble and footy; 'tis plainly your duty

            To "chuck" the Old Flame, and take on the
            Young Spark.

            A Cyclops for lover, no doubt you discover,

            My dear Lady LONDON, is not comme il
            faut;

            If I do not woo you the sunny earth over.

            At least I lend light to love-making
            below. a name="page231"
               id="page231">[pg 231]
        

        
            He's just like old Pluto, Persephone's prigger;

            You'll follow Apollo the
            Younger       that's me!

            He's sombre as Styx, and as black as a nigger.

            His lady-love, LONDON! Bah!
            Fiddle-de-dee!
        

        
            His murky monopoly, Madam, is ended.

            Come down, my dear love, to my subterrene
            hall!

            I think you'll admit it is sparkling and
            splendid,

            As clean as a palace, not black as a
            pall.

            Electrical traction with sheer stupefaction

            Strikes Steam, the old buffer, and spoils
            his small game.

            You're off with the old Love, so try the new bold
            Love,

            And let the Young Spark supersede the Old
            Flame.
        
    

    [Carries her off in triumph.
    

    PARS ABOUT PICTURES.

    Close upon a hundred years ago, when GEORGE THE THIRD was
    King, MENDOZA opened a saloon in the Strand, whereat various
    studies in Black and Blue might be enjoyed. To-day MENDOZA has
    a gallery in King Street, which is devoted to studies in Black
    and White. You may say, history repeats itself. Nothing of the
    kind. The gentleman of GEORGE THE THIRD'S time devoted himself
    to the pugilistic art; the gentleman of the time of VICTORIA
    gives his attention to graphic art. The one was the patron of
    fists, the other of fingers       that makes all the
    difference. MENDOZA the Past, closed eyes       MENDOZA the
    Present opens them, and, if you go to the St. James's Gallery,
    you will find a pleasant collection of Eye Art       open to
    all peepers. It is true it may not be High Art, but you will
    find it, like Epps's Cocoa, "grateful and comforting."

    Mr. MCLEAN, who has had an Art-show in the Haymarket since
    the days of GEORGE THE THIRD, or rather his ancestor had, is
    "quite up to time, and smiling," with his present collection
    (your Old PAR can't help using the argot of the P.R., and
    brings COLE, not to Newcastle, but to the Haymarket, in "A
    Bend in the River, near Maple Durham." He shows us the
    views of BURTON BARBER on "Compulsory Education," also a
    wondrous picture of the "Gate of the Great Mosque of
    Damascus," by BAUERNFEIND, "A Venetian Brunette," by
    FILDES, and many other works that will well repay inspection,
    but of which there is no space for anything more to be said by
    yours par-enthetically,

    OLD PAR.
    

    THE GENTLE ART (OF SNIGGLING).

    
        ["Whoever walks beside the river (the
        Ettrick), will observe five or six or more men and boys,
        equipped with gigantic wading-breeches, busy in each pool.
        They are only armed with rods and flies, and thus have a
        false appearance of being fair fishers.... The truth is
        that the apparent sportsmen are snigglers, not anglers.
        They drive the top part of their rods deep into the water,
        so as to rake the bottom, and then bring the hook out with
        a jerk. Every now and then ... one of the persecuted fishes
        ... is hauled out with short shrift."       Daily
        News.]
    

    
        
            Oh! the world's very bad, and our hearts they are
            sore

            As we think of the errors and wrongs we
            have got to

            Endure uncomplaining, and oh! we deplore

            The things people do, that they really
            ought not to!

            With Courtesy dead, and with Justice "a-bed,"

            When the mention of Love only causes a
            giggle,       

            But we'd manage to live and still hold up our
            head,

            Were it not for the villain who ventures
            to sniggle.
        

        
            With his rod and his hook see him carefully rake

            The bed of the river, and gallantly
            wading,

            Arrayed in his breeches, endeavour to make

            Of genuine sport but a mere
            masquerading.

            You might think him a fool for his trouble       but
            look!

            (And it's true, though at first it
            appears to be gammon)

            With a horrible jerk, as he pulls up his hook,

            The sportsmanlike sniggler has landed a
            salmon!
        

        
            As a nation of sportsmen, it rouses our ire

            To hear of sport ruined by such a
            proceeding;

            And to snigglers we earnestly wish and desire

            To give the advice they so sadly seem
            needing.

            Let them think, as they work their inglorious
            plan,

            How old IZAAK must turn in his grave and
            must wriggle;

            And may they in future all see if they can,

            By learning to angle, forget how to
            sniggle!
        
    
    

    IN OUR GARDEN.

    Discovered on returning home that the Member for SARK had
    not at all exaggerated the facts picturing disaster to our
    onion-bed. This portion of the garden had been disappointing
    from the first. Early in the Spring, when hope beat high, and
    the young gardener's fancy lightly turned to thoughts of large
    crops, SARK and I were resting after a frugal luncheon, when
    ARPACHSHAD suddenly appeared at the open window. I knew from
    his beaming face that something was wrong.

    Perhaps I should explain that ARPACHSHAD is our head
    gardener. We have no other, therefore he is the head. Out of
    the garden he is known as PETER WALLOPS. It was SARK who
    insisted upon calling him ARPACHSHAD. SARK had noticed that
    about the time of the Flood there was singular deliberation in
    entering upon the marriage state. Matrimony did not seem to be
    thought of till a man had turned the corner of a century. SHEM,
    himself, for example, was fully a hundred before his third son,
    ARPACHSHAD, was born. But ARPACHSHAD was already a husband and
    a father at thirty-five.

    "That," said SARK, "is a remarkable circumstance that has
    escaped the notice of the commentators. It indicates unusual
    forwardness of character and a habit of swift decision. We hear
    nothing more of ARPACHSHAD, but we may be sure he made things
    move. Now what we want in this garden is a brisk man, a fellow
    always up to date, if not ahead of it. Let us encourage WALLOPS
    by calling him ARPACHSHAD."

    WALLOPS on being consulted said, he thought it ought to be a
    matter of another two shillings a-week in his wages; to which I
    demurred, and it was finally compromised on the basis of a rise
    of a shilling a-week. As far as I have observed, SARK'S device,
    like many others he has put forward, has nothing in it. WALLOPS
    couldn't be slower in going round than is ARPACHSHAD. The only
    time he ever displays any animation is when he discovers some
    fresh disaster. When things are going well (which isn't often)
    he is gloomy and apprehensive of an early change for the worse.
    When the worst comes he positively beams over it. Difficult to
    say whether he enjoys himself more in an over-wet season, or in
    one of drought. His special and ever-recurring joy is the
    discovery of some insect breaking out in a fresh place. He is
    always on the look-out for the Mottled Amber Moth, or the
    Frit-fly, or the Currant Scale, or the Apple-bark Beetle, or
    the Mustard Beetle,       "Black Jack," as he familiarly calls
    him. To see, as is not unfrequent, a promising apple-tree,
    cherry-tree, or damson-tree, fading under the attack of the
    caterpillars of the Winter Moth, makes ARPACHSHAD a new man.
    His back unbends, his wrinkles smooth out, the gleam of faded
    youth reillumines his countenance, and his eyes melt in softer
    glance.

    "The flies hev got at them honions," he said, on this Spring
    afternoon. "I thought they would, and I reckon they're done
    for. Ever seen a honion-fly, Sir? A nice, lively, busy-looking
    thing; pretty reddish-grey coat, with a whitish face, and pale
    grey wings. About this time of the year it lays its eggs on the
    sheath of the onion-leaf, and within a week you've got the
    larvey burrowing down into the bulb; after which, there's
    hardly any hope for your honion."

    "Can nothing be done to save them?" SARK asked. As far me, I
    was too down-hearted to speak.

    "Well," said ARPACHSHAD, ruefully, not liking the prospect
    of interfering with beneficent Nature, "if you was to get a bag
    of soot, wait about till a shower was a coming on, carefully
    sprinkle the plant, and let the soot wash in, that
     a name="page232"
       id="page232">[pg 232] might save a few here and
       there. Or if you were to get a can of paraffin, and syringe
       them, it would make the fly sit up. But I don't know as how
       it's worth the trouble. Nater will have its way, and, if the
       fly wants the honion, who are we that we should say it nay?
       I think, TOBY, M.P., if I was you, I'd let things take their
       swing. It's a terrible thing to go a interfering with
       Nater."

    But we didn't follow ARPACHSHAD'S advice. Having undertaken
    to run this garden, we were determined to do it thoroughly; so
    I got SARK to sweep out the flues of the furnace in the
    greenhouse, in the course of which he broke several panes of
    glass, not expecting, so he explained, to find the handle of
    his brush so near the roof. We half filled a sack with soot,
    and carried it to the onion-bed. Then we waited for a wet day,
    usually plentiful enough in haymaking time, now long deferred.
    ARPACHSHAD insisted that we were to make quite sure that rain
    was coming       then sprinkle the soot over the unsuspectiong
    onion. "We waited just too long, not starting till the rain
    began to fall. Found it exceedingly unpleasant handling the
    soot under conditions of moisture. But, as SARK said, having
    put our hands to the soot-bag, we were not going to turn back.
    Nor did we till we had completed the task, ARPACHSHAD looking
    on, cheered only by the hope that the heavy rain would wash the
    soot off before it could have any effect on the fly. On the
    whole, the task proved productive of reward. Either ARPACHSHAD
    had been mistaken, and the crop had not been attacked by the
    fly, or the soot had done its work. Anyhow, the bed bloomed and
    blossomed, and, at the time I left for Midlothian, was looking
    exceedingly well. Then came SARK'S telegram, as described in
    the last chapter. After the fly came the mildew. Close on the
    heels, or rather the wings, of the Anthomyia Ceparum,
    fell the Peronospora Schleideniana.

    "It isn't often it happens," said ARPACHSHAD, rubbing his
    hands gleefully;       "but, when you get one on the top of
    t'other, you don't look for much crop in that particular
    year."
    

    HOW IT'S DONE.

    A Hand-book to Honesty.

    No. V.       MONEY LENT (ONE WAY AMONG MANY.)

    SCENE I.       Apartment of innocent but
    temporarily impecunious person.

    I.P. discovered reading advertisements and
    correspondence.

    
         img width="100%"
             src="images/232.png"
             alt="HOW IT'S DONE" />
    

    Impecunious Person. Humph! It sounds all
    right. I have heard that these Loan-mongers are
    sometimes scoundrels and sharks. But this one is surely
    genuine. There is a manly frankness, a sort of considerate and
    sympathetic delicacy about him, that quite appeals to one. No
    inquiry fees, no publicity, no delay! Just what I want. Has
    clients, men of capital, but not speculators, who wish
    to invest money on sound security at reasonable interest. Just
    so! Note of hand of any respectable person sufficient.
    That's all right. Advance at a few hours' notice.
    Excellent! Let me see, the address is Fitz-Guelph Mansions, W.
    That sounds respectable enough. A penniless shark would hardly
    live there. By Jove, I'll write, and make an appointment
    at his own address, as he suggests.

    [Does so, hopefully.

    SCENE II.       Fitz-Guelph Mansions, W.,
    at 11 A.M. Enter Impecunious Person,
    hurriedly.

    Impecunious Person. Ah! I'm a little bit late, but
    here's the place sure enough, and that's the number. Fine
    house, too. Nothing sharkish about this, anyhow.

    [Makes for No. 14, consulting his watch.
    On door-step encounters another person, also apparently in a
    hurry, and also consulting his watch. This person is perhaps a
    trifle shabby-genteel in attire, but genially pompous and
    semi-military in bearing. He makes as if to go, but stopping
    suddenly, stares at I.P., and addresses
    him.       

    Ahem! I       a       beg pardon, I'm sure, but have you by
    any chance an appointment for 11 A.M. at this address, with a
    Mr. MUGSNAP?

    I.P. Why       a       yes, as a matter of fact, I
    have.

    Mr. Mugsnap. Quite so. And your name is
    SOFTSHELL?

    I.P. Well       yes, as a matter of fact, it is.

    Mr. Mugsnap (cheerily). Ah! that's all right. Well
    met, Mr. SOFTSHELL! (Produces letter.) This is yours, I
    fancy. The time was eleven sharp, and you're just seven minutes
    and a quarter behind. I was just off, for if I gave all my
    clients seven minutes and a quarter grace, I should lose about
    four hours a day, Sir. (Laughs jovially.) But no matter!
    Just step this way. (Produces latch-key.) But no, on
    second thoughts I won't go back. Unlucky, you know! We'll step
    across to the Wine Shades yonder, and talk our business over
    together with a glass of sound port, my boy. Best glass of port
    in London, BUMPUS sells, and as an old Army Man I appreciate
    it.

    [They cross to "The Shades," where
    Mr. MUGSNAP wins upon his companion by his hearty style, and
    all difficulties in the way of "an early advance" are smoothed
    away in a highly satisfactory manner. A couple of references,
    of course, "just as a matter of form," and a couple of guineas
    for visiting them. Not an Inquiry Fee, oh! dear no, merely
    "expenses." Some people apply for a loan, and, when everything
    is arranged, actually decline to receive it! Must provide
    against that, you knew. Within three days at the
    outside, Mr. SOFTSHELL is assured, that money will be in
    his hands without fail. Meanwhile the "couple o' guineas" leave
    his hands, and Mr. MUGSNAP leaves him, hopeful,
    and admiring.

    I.P. (strolling homeward). Very pleasant person, Mr.
    MUGSNAP. Quite a pleasure to deal with him. Sharks, indeed! How
    worthy people get misrepresented! By the way, though, there's
    one question I forgot to ask him. I'll just step back. Don't
    suppose he has gone yet.

    [Returns to No. 14, Fitz-Guelph Mansions.
    Knocks, and is answered by smart and austere-looking
    Domestic.

    I.P. Oh, just tell Mr. MUGSNAP I should like just
    one word more with him. Won't detain him a moment.

    Austere Domestic. Mr. MUGSNAP! And who's Mr. MUGSNAP,
    pray? Don't know any sech persing.

    I.P. Oh yes, he lives here. Met him, by appointment,
    only an hour ago. Hasn't he returned?

    A.D. (emphatically). I tell you there ain't no Mr.
    MUGSNAP lives here at all.

    I.P. Oh dear, yes! Stout
    gentleman       military appearance       white waistcoat!

    A.S. (scornfully). Oh, him! I saw sech a party
    'anging about suspiciously awhile ago, and spoke to the
    perliceman about him. But I don't know him, and he don't
    live here! [Shuts door sharply.

    I.P. (perspiring profusely, as the state of things dawns
    upon him! ) Phew! I see it all. "A plant." That's
    why he met me on the door-step. Of course he doesn't live here
    at all. Gave a respectable address, and watched for me
    outside! And the sleek-spoken shark is gone! So are my two
    guineas!

    [Retires a sadder, and a wiser
    man.
    

    THE MAN OF SCIENCE.

    
        [It has been suggested, with reference to an amusing
        article in Blackwood, on a new religion, that
        science is equal to it.]
    

    PROFESSOR PROTOPLASM sings:       

    
        
            I'm a mighty man of science, and on that I place
            reliance,

            And I hurl a stern defiance at what other
            people say:

            Learning's torch I fiercely kindle, with my HAECKEL,
            HUXLEY, TYNDALL,

            And all preaching is a swindle, that's
            the motto of to-day.

            I'd give the wildest latitude to each agnostic
            attitude,

            And everything's a platitude that springs
            not from my mind:

            I've studied entomology, astronomy, conchology,

            And every other 'ology that anyone can
            find.

            I am a man of science, with my bottles on
            the shelf,

            I'm game to make a little world, and
            govern it myself.
        

        
            I'm a demon at dissection, and I've always had
            affection

            For a curious collection from both
            animals and man:

            I've a lovely pterodactyle, some old bones a little
            cracked, I'll

            Get some mummies, and in fact I'll pounce
            on anything I can.

            I'm full of lore botanical, and chemistry
            organical,

            I oft put in a panic all the neighbours I
            must own:

            They smell the fumes and phosphorus from London to
            the Bosphorus:

            Oh, sad would be the loss for us, had I
            been never known.

            I am a man of science, with my bottles on
            the shelf;

            I'm game to make a little world, and

    Read The World and the Will, by JAMES PAYN, says the
    Baron. Successful novelist is our "J.P." for England and the
    Colonies generally. "The profits blazoned on the Payn," is a
    line he quotes, with a slight difference of spelling, in his
    present three volumes, which is full of good things; his own
    "asides" being, to my thinking, quoth the Baron, by far the
    most enjoyable part of his books. Herein he resembles
    THACKERAY, who used to delight in taking the reader behind the
    scenes, and exhibiting the wires. Not so JAMES PAYN. He comes
    in front, and comments upon the actions of his puppets, or upon
    men and morals in general, or he makes a quip, or utters a
    quirk, or proposes a quiddity, and pauses to laugh with you,
    before he resumes the story, and says, with the older
    romancers, "But to our tale." Most companionable writer is
    JAMES PAYN. Tells his story so clearly. A PAYN to be seen
    through.

    In the christening of his Christmas books, Mr. MERRY ANDREW
    LANG has hit upon a genuine Happy Thought, on which the Baron
    begs sincerely to congratulate him. It is a perfect little gold
    mine as a book-title series. Last year M. ANDREW LANG wrote,
    and LANGMAN'S       no, beg pardon       LONGMANS published
    The Blue Fairy Book. The Blue Fairy Book, when it
    appeared, however, was read everywhere, so this year the MERRY
    ANDREW issues The Red Fairy Book, which, of course, will
    be more read than the other. Excellent notion! Where will it
    stop? Why should it stop? Next year there'll be The Green
    Fairy Book; in '92 the Yellow Fairy Book (commencing
    with new version of Yellow Dwarf), then the White, then
    the Black, then the Ver-millionth edition, and so on and so on,
    ad infinitum, through all the possible stages of the
    combination and permutation of colour.

    The Magazine of Art for 1890, published by CASSELL
          Co., is one of the best of its kind for pictures and
    Art-articles, The Mixture as before.

    "Christmas is coming"       but the Publishers seem to think
    that the Merry Old Gentleman will be here to-morrow. Yet we
    know the proverbial history of to-morrow. However, to humour
    the up-to-date notion, the Baron recommends to his young
    friends who wish to amuse their elders, Dolldom, a
    dolls' opera, by CLIFTON BINGHAM, set to music by FLORIAN
    PASCAL. Some of the songs are exquisite. It would make a very
    funny play, children imitating dolls. Published by J.
    WILLIAMS.

    BLACKIE AND SON, are going it. Here are two more, by their
    indefatigable writer, G.A. HENTY: By Right of Conquest; or,
    With Cortez in Mexico. The young Sixteenth-Century boy, by
    his marvellous adventures, proves his right to be a hero
    in the Conquest of Mexico. Of a more modern date is A
    Chapter of Accidents, which deals with the Bombardment of
    Alexandria. The young fisher-lad has to go through many
    chapters of adventure before he reaches a happy ending. A
    Rough Shaking, by GEORGE MACDONALD, is a capital boys'
    book, while The Light Princess, and other Fairy Stories,
    by the same author, will please the Baron's old-fashioned
    fairy-book readers at Christmas-time.

    Whoever possesses the Henry Irving
    Shakspeare,       started originally by my dear old
    enthusiastic friend the late FRANK MARSHALL, and now concluded
    by the new volume of plays, poems, and sonnets,       possesses
    a literary treasure. The notes are varied, interesting, and all
    valuable. The illustrations exactly serve their purpose, which
    is the highest praise.

    MR. SMALLEY'S Letters are not to an Inconnue. They
    were written to his paper, the Tribune, and have
    redressed the balance between the Old World and the New by
    furnishing New York from week to week with brilliant, incisive,
    and faithful pictures of life in London. The initials,
    "G.W.S.," appended in their original form, are as familiar
    throughout the United States as are those of our own "G.A.S."
    in the still United Kingdom. Mr. SMALLEY goes everywhere, sees
    everything, knows everybody, and his readers in New York learn
    a great deal more of what is going on in London than some of us
    who live here. Most public men of the present day, whether in
    politics, literature, or art, have, all unconsciously, sat to
    "G.W.S." He has a wonderful gift of seizing the salient points
    of a character, and reproducing them in a few pellucid
    sentences. The men he treats of have many friends who will be
    delighted to find that Mr. SMALLEY'S pen is dipped in just
    enough gall to make the writing pleasant to those who are not
    its topic. Personalities is the alluring title of the
    first volume, which contains forty-two studies of character. It
    is dangerous kind of work; but Mr. SMALLEY has skilfully
    steered his passage. Written for a newspaper, London
    Letters (MACMILLAN       CO.) rank higher than journalism.
    They will take their place in Literature.

    November Number of the English Illustrated Magazine,
    excellent. Wykehamists, please note Mr. GALE'S article, and
    Lord SELBORNE'S introduction. The COOKE who presides in this
    particular kitchen serves up a capital dish every
    month       and "quite English, you know."

    My faithful "Co." has been rather startled by a volume
    called The Decline and Fall of the British Empire,
    written by "Anonymous," and published by the Messrs. TRISCHLER.
    The tome deals with Australia, rather than England, and is
    dated a thousand years hence; so those who have no immediate
    leisure will have plenty of time to read it before the events
    therein recorded, so to speak, reach maturity.

    I notice an advertisement of a book by Major ELLIS, entitled
    The Ewe-speaking People of the Slave Coast of West
    Africa. These Ewe-speaking folk must be a sheepish lot.
    Black-sheepish lot apparently, as being in West Africa. Major
    ELLIS is the author also of The Tshi-speaking People.
    These last must be either timidly bashful, or else a very T-shi
    lot. After this, there's nothing ELLIS this week, says

    DEAREST BECKY,       I have had such luck! Oh,
    so fortunate! Fancy, we did get in, after all!
    You know Mr. TENTERFORE, of Somerset House, has a friend a
    barrister, and this friend said, if we would be by the door of
    the Court at eleven, he thought he could slip us in. And
    he did, my dear       he did! We got capital places, and
    as we had brought with us some sherry and sandwiches, we had "a
    real good time of it," as your brother calls it! We had our
    work, too, and so were quite comfortable. The
    night-charges were such fun! A lot of men and women were
    brought before the Magistrate for being "drunk and incapable"
    (that's a legal term, my dear), and got so chaffed! One of the
    women was very old       such a silly frump!       she was
    still dreadfully intoxicated I am afraid! Very sad, of
    course, but we couldn't help laughing! She was such
    a figure before they got rid of her! But this was only the
    overture to the drama. After the night-charges were over, the
    Court was cleared, but we were allowed to remain, as Mr.
    WIGINBLOCK (our barrister friend) declared we belonged to the
    Press! He said that MARY contributed to the Blood and
    Thunder News, and I to the Murder Gazette! I am sure
    it must have been in fun, for we have never seen
    the papers. When lunch was over, in came the Magistrate with
    a number of the "smartest" people! Really, I was
    quite delighted to be in such good company. All
    sorts of nice people. And then       oh       it was
    lovely! We saw her quite close, and could watch
    the colour come and go in her cheeks! She is rather pretty! She
    was wearing her ordinary clothes; not the workhouse, nor
    the ones with the blood on them, but some that had been
    sent in to her since the inquest. I tried your opera-glasses.
    They are simply capital, darling! We were much amused
    with his evidence; and it was really excellent
    fun to listen to the howls of the crowd outside! But I am not
    sure he cared for them! We got away in excellent
    time, and I hope to go again. I am trying very hard
    (should it come to anything) to be present at the last scene
    of all! Wouldn't that be lovely? I should have to be
    at the place, though, at ten minutes to eight o'clock! I
    don't think I should go to bed that night at all! If I
    did, I am sure I should not sleep! It would be so very,
    very interesting! And now, my dearest,
    good-bye.

    Your ever most affectionate friend,

    LUCRETIA.
    

    "MINE EASE AT MY CLUB."       In its most useful and
    instructive theatrical column last Sunday's Observer
    (the only Observer of a Sunday in London!) inserted this
    notice:       

    
        "Mr. H.A. JONES is to read a paper at the Playgoers'
        Club, Henrietta Street, Tuesday next."
    

    Why announce it? Why not let the hard-worked HENRY AUTHOR
    JONES read his paper at his Club in peace and quietness? Very
    hard on poor HENRY DRAMATIC AUTHOR JONES, if he can't have a
    few minutes of peace (not "piece," bien entendu) to
    himself. Leave him alone to take his ease at his Club.

            The Durham men still brag on.

            How the "Laidly Worm" was made to squirm

            Old legends tell (they can't lie!);

            And of MORE, of More-hall, when, "with nothing at
            all,"

            He slew the Dragon of Wantley.
        

        
            Our Dragon here is a bigger beast

            Than LAMBTON slew, or MORE did;

            On poor men's bodies he doth feast,

            And ill-got gold long hoarded.

            He hath iron claws, and from his jaws

            Foul fumings are emitted.

            The folks, his prey, who cross his way,

            Are sorely to be pitied.
        

        
            Have you not heard how the Trojan horse

            Held seventy men inside him?

            This Dragon's bigger, and of such force

            That none may rein or ride him.

            Men hour by hour he doth devour,

            And would they with him grapple,

            At one big sup he'll gobble them up,

            As schoolboys munch an apple.
        

        
            All sorts of prey this Dragon doth eat;

            But his favourite food's poor people,

            But he 'd swallow a city, street by street,

            From cottage to church steeple.

            Like the Worm of Wear, this Dragon drear,

            Hath grown, and grown, and grown,
            Sir,

            And many a lair of dim despair

            The Worm hath made its own, Sir.
        

        
            In Bethnal Green our Laidly Worm

            Hath made a loathly den,

            And there hath fed for a weary term

            On the bodies and souls of men.

            There doth it writhe, and ramp, and slower,

            Whilst in its coils close prest

            Are the things it thrives on       "Landlord
            Power,"

            And "Vested Interest."
        

        
            Now, who shall tackle this Dragon bold?

            Lo! a champion appears.

            He seems but small, and he looks not old       

            A youth of scarce three years.

            But "he hath put on his coat of mail,

            Thick set with razors all,"

            And a blade as big as a thresher's nail,

            On that Dragon's crest to fall.
        

        
            And like young LAMBTON, or young MORE,

            He to the fight advances.

            Yet looks to that Slum Dragon o'er,

            With caution in his glances.

            If he make shift that sword to lift,

            And smite that Dragon dead,

            No hero young song yet hath sung

            A fouler pest hath sped.
        

        
            Now guard ye, guard ye, young County C.!

            That two-edged blade is big, Sir!

            That Dragon's so spiky, he well might be

            "Some Egyptian porcupig," Sir,

            (As the singer of Wantley's Dragon says,

            In his quaint and curious story.)

            If this Dragon he slays, he shall win men's
            praise,

            And legendary glory.
        

        
            When London's streets are haunts of health

            (Ah! happy if distant, when)

            And the death-rate ruleth low, and Wealth

            Feeds not on the filthy den;

            The men to this champion's memory

            Shall lift the brimming flagon,

            And drink with glee to young County C,

            Who slew the Grim Slum Dragon!
        
    
    

    A "DARK CONTINENT" HINT.       Mr. STANLEY, it is said, now
    wishes he had gone on his exploration journey quite alone,
    without any travelling TROUP. It is a curious fact, but worth
    mentioning here, that, up to now, the only mention of
    difficulties with a "Travelling Troupe" is to be found in a
    little shilling book recently published by Messrs. TRISCHLER
          CO., at present nearing its fifty thousandth copy,
    entitled, A New Light thrown across the Darkest Africa.
    Whether H.M. STANLEY will appeal to this as evidence remains to
    be seen. We must have the whole truth out about STANLEY'S Rear
    Column before we rear a column to STANLEY.
    

    The "NORFOLK BROADS," according to the Standard, are
    in future to be the English cradle of the German "Bass." Not
    beer, but fish. There are to be "no takers" at present, so the
    cradle will not be a Bass-in-net.

    OPERATIC NOTES.

    Wednesday.       Welcome once more to our old friend,
    Norma, the Deceived Druidess, who was called
    Norma for short, she being an orphan, and having "nor
    par, nor ma." The Ancient Order of Druids, with Arch-Druid
    Oroveso in the chair, might have had a better brass
    band. Norma nowadays is not particularly attractive, and
    the house, when it is given, cannot be expected to be more than
    normal or ordinary.

    Thursday.       Orf        o. First appearance of
    Miles. GIULIA and SOFIA RAVOGLI in GL      CK'S beautiful
    Opera, which has not been seen here for many years,
    but       judging from its reception by a full and delighted
    house       will be seen many times before Signor LAGO'S season
    comes to an end. Enthusiastic reception of GIULIA RAVOGLI as
    Orpheus; double recall after three of the four Acts;
    house insisting on having "Che far        " all over
    again. Orchestra, under Signor BEVIGNANI, admirable.
    Recreations of Demons and Furies, when let out of Gates of
    Erebus for a half-holiday, peculiar, not to say eccentric.
    Demons lie on rocks, with silver serpents round their necks as
    comforters, claw the air, and trot round in circles, after
    which they exhibit Dutch-metalled walking-sticks to one another
    with sombre pride. Furies trip measures and strike attitudes in
    pink tights and draperies of un       sthetic hues, when not
    engaged in witnessing, with qualified interest, incidental
    dances by two premi        res danseuses. Hades
    evidently less dull than generally supposed.
    

    SUGGESTION.       Curious that no enterprising shaving-soap
    proprietor has as yet, as far as we know, advertised his
    invention as "Tabula Rasa." This is worth thousands, and
    takes the cake       of soap.
    

    QUIS NOMINABIT?

    (Being a few Remarks          Apropos of a
    "British Academy of Letters.")

    
        MR. PUNCH, SIR,

        I have been reading with some morbid interest a series
        of contributions to the pages of a contemporary from
        several more or less distinguished literary men who have
        apparently been invited to express their opinions,
        favourable or the reverse, on the recently launched
        proposition to establish in our midst, after the French
        model, a "British Academy of Letters." Some ask, "What's
        the use?" Others want to know who is to elect the elected,
        and seem much exercised in their minds as to the status and
        qualifications of those who ought to be chosen for the
        purpose of discharging this all-important function. As to
        what would be the use of an institution of the kind, the
        answer is so obvious that I will not attempt to reply to
        it. But if it comes to naming a representative body capable
        of selecting the two or three thousand aspirants who have
        already, in imagination, seen their claims to the
        distinction recognised by the elective body to which has
        been entrusted the duty of weighing their respective
        merits       well then, to use a colloquial phrase, I may
        confidently say that "I am all there!"

        Of course. Royalty must head it, so I head the list of,
        say, twelve Academic Electors, with the name of H.R.H. the
        Prince of WALES. This should be followed up by that of some
        generally widely-known personage, who has the literary
        confidence of the public, and in this connection, I have no
        hesitation in supplying it by that of the Compiler of
        Bradshaw's Railway Guide. Several now should follow,
        of varied and even conflicting interests, so as to satisfy
        any over-captious criticism inclined to question the
        thoroughly cosmopolitan character of the elective body. And
        so I next add, Mr. Sheriff AUGUSTUS HARRIS, H.R.H. the Duke
        of CAMBRIDGE, the Proprietor of PEARS' Soap, and the Beadle
        of the Burlington Arcade.

        It might now be well to give a distinctively literary
        flavour to the body, and so I am disposed to continue my
        list with the names of the Poet Laureate and the City
        Editor of Tit Bits, following them up with the
        representatives of commercial enterprise, speculative art,
        and sportive leisure, guaranteed respectively by the names
        of the Chairman of the Chelsea Steam-boat Company, Mr. R.
        D'OYLY CARTE, and Prince HENRY OP BATTENBERG. For the
        twelfth, and remaining name, I would suggest that of Mr.
        HENRY IRVING, the Archbishop of CANTERBURY, the Manager of
        Madame TUSSAUD'S Wax Works, Sir WILFRID LAWSON, General
        BOOTH, Mr. SLAVIN, Mr. J.L. TOOLE, or any other striking or
        notable one that arrests the eye with the familiarity of
        long acquaintance. With the existing deplorable position of
        the Pantomime literature of the country, there can be
        little need to question further the necessity of a British
        Academy of Letters. The naming of those who are to
        constitute that institution is another thing; but if an
        authoritative fountain-head, to discharge this inevitable
        function, is sought, and the public puts the question,
        "Quis Nominabit?" I think, Sir, you will admit that
        I have most satisfactorily supplied the answer. Trusting to
        your judicious appreciation of the full gravity of the
        matter at issue, to publish this communication,

        I am, Sir, your obedient
           servant,

        A VERY POSSIBLE FUTURE ACADEMICIAN.
    
    

    BEFORE AND BEHIND.

    (From a Thoughtful Grammarian.)

    
        SIR,       In the Times' Court Circular, on
        Friday last, I read that       

        
            "Mr. WILLIAM NICHOLL had the honour of
            singing before Her MAJESTY and the Royal Family."
        

        This was indeed an honour. I regret that the Courtly
        Circularist did not tell us what Mr. NICHOLL sang before
        the QUEEN and Royal Family, and also what the QUEEN and
        Royal Family sang (solo and chorus?) after Mr. NICHOLL. But
        suppose "before" does not here relate to time, but to
        position. It would have been a novelty indeed, and one well
        worth recording, if Mr. NICHOLL had had the honour of
        sinking behind the Royal Family. And then, what a
        compliment if Her Gracious MAJESTY and the Royal Family had
        all turned round to listen to him! If I am wrong in my
        interpretation of the Court Circular's Circular Note,
        wouldn't it have prevented any possible error to have said,
        "In the presence of"? I only ask for information, and
        am

        Yours,

        FIDELITER.
    
    

    A NEW TRACT FOR THE SALVATION ARMY.       The "General," who
    is the biggest BOOTH in the show, announced last week that he
    had been offered a big tract of land. Hear! Hear! Where? Where?
    "Anywhere, anywhere out of the world "       at least, out of
    our little world of Great Britain       Co. Let not "the
    General" be too particular, but accept the tract,       though
    he is more used to distributing tracts than accepting
    them,       and let him and his army, his lads and lasses, go
    away and leave us to enjoy our Sundays in peace and quiet.

    AN EVENING WITH A CONJUROR.

    SCENE       A Suburban Hall. The
    Performance has not yet begun. The Audience is limited, and
    low-spirited, and may perhaps number       including the
    Attendants       eighteen. The only people in the front seats
    are, a man in full evening dress, which he tries to conceal
    under a caped cloak, and two Ladies in plush opera-cloaks. Fog
    is hanging about in the rafters, and the gas-stars sing a
    melancholy dirge. Each casual cough arouses dismal echoes.
    Enter an intending Spectator, who is conducted to a seat in the
    middle of an empty row. After removing his hat and coat, he
    suddenly thinks better       or worse       of it, puts them on
    again, and vanishes hurriedly.

    First Sardonic Attendant (at doorway). Reg'lar
    turnin' em away to-night, we are!

    Second Sardonic Attendant. He come up to me afore he
    goes to the pay-box, and sez he       "Is there a seat left?"
    he sez. And I sez to 'im, "Well, I think we can manage
    to squeeze you in somewhere." Like that, I sez.

    [The Orchestra, consisting of two
    thin-armed little girls, with pigtails, enter, and perform a
    stumbling Overture upon a cracked piano. Herr Von
    KAMBERWOHL, the Conjuror, appears on platform, amidst loud
    clapping from two obvious Confederates in a back row.

    Herr V. K. (in a mixed accent). Lyties and
    Shentilmans, pefoor I co-mence viz my hillusions zis hevenin',
    I 'ave, most hemphadically to repoodiate hall hassistance from

    of 'and, or Ledger-dee-Mang! (He invites any member of the
    Audience to step up and assist him, but the spectators remain
    coy.) I see zat I 'ave not to-night so larsh an orjence to
    select from as usual, still I 'ope              (Here one of
    the obvious Confederates slouches up, and joins him on the
    platform. ) Ah, zat is goot! I am vair moch oblige to you,
    Sare. (The Confederate grins sheepishly.) Led me
    see       I seem to remember your face some'ow. (Broader
    grin from Confederate.) Hah, you vos 'ere last

    You nevaire dell vat you gan do till you dry, as ze ole sow

    laugh       which doesn't come.) Now, Sare, you know a cart
    ven you see 'im? Ah, zat is somtings alretty! Now I vill ask
    you to choose any cart or carts out of zis back. (The
    Confederate fumbles.) I don't vish to 'urry you       but I

    The Man in Evening Dress. I remember giving BIMBO,
    the Wizard of the West, a guinea once to teach me that
    trick       there was nothing in it.

    First Lady in Plush Cloak. And can you do
    it?

    The M. in E.D. (guardedly). Well, I don't know that I
    could exactly do it now       but I know how it's
    done.

    [He explains elaborately how it is
    done.

    Herr Von K. (stamping, as a signal that the Orchestra may
    leave off). Next I shall show you my zelebrated hillusion
    of ze inexhaustible 'At, to gonclude viz ze Invisible 'En. And
    I shall be moch oblige if any shentelmans vill kindly favour me
    viz 'is 'at for ze burpose of my exberiment.

    The M. in E.D. Here's mine       it's quite at your
    service. [To his companions. ] This is a stale old
    trick, he merely       (explains as before. ) But you
    wait and see how I 'll score off him over it!

    Herr V.K. (to the M. in E.D). You are gvide sure,
    Sare, you leaf nossing insoide of your 'at?

    The M. in E.D. (with a wink to his neighbours). On
    the contrary, there are several little things there belonging
    to me, which I'll thank you to give me back by-and-by.

    Herr V.K. (diving into the hat). So? Vat 'ave we
    'ere? A bonch of flowairs! Anozzer bonch of flowairs?
    Anozzer       and anozzer! Ha, do you alvays garry
    flowairs insoide your 'at, Sare?

    The M. in E.D. Invariably       to keep my head cool;
    so hand them over, please; I want them.

    [His Companions titter, and declare "it
    really is too bad of him!"

    Herr V.K.. Bresently, Sare,       zere is somtings
    ailse, it feels loike       yes, it ees       a mahouse-drap.
    Your haid is drouble vid moice, Sare, yes? Bot zere is none

    The M. in E.D. (with rather feeble indignation.) I
    never said there were.

    Herr V.K. No, zere is no
    mahouse       bot       [diving again]       ha! a

    [He showers cards, commending somebody's
    self-adjusting trousers amongst the Audience, each person
    receiving about two dozen       chiefly in the eye       until
    the air is dark, and the floor thick with them.

    The M. in E.D. (much annoyed). Infernal liberty!
    Confounded impudence! Shouldn't have had my hat if I 'd
    known he was going to play the fool with it like this!

    First Lady in Plush Cloak. But I thought you knew
    what was coming?

    The M. in E.D. So I did       but this fellow does it
    differently.

    [Herr VON K. is preparing to fire a
    marked half-crown from a blunderbuss into a crystal
    casket.

    A Lady with Nerves (to her husband). JOHN, I'm
    sure he's going to let that thing off!

    John (a Brute). Well, I shouldn't be surprised if he
    is. I can't help it.

    The L. with N. You could if you liked       you could
    tell him my nerves won't stand it       the trick will be every
    bit as good if he only pretends to fire, I'm
    sure.

    John. Oh, nonsense!       you can stand it very well
    if you like.

    The L. w. N. I can't, John.... There, he's
    raising it to his shoulder. JOHN, I must go out. I shall
    scream if I sit here, I know I shall!

    John. No, no       what's the use? He'll have fired
    long before you get to the door. Much better stay where you
    are, and do your screaming sitting down. (The Conjuror
    fires.) There, you see, you didn't scream, after
    all!

    The L. w. N. I screamed to myself       which
    is ever so much worse for me; but you never will
    understand me till it's too late!

    [Herr VON K. performs another
    trick.

    First Lady in Plush Cloak. That was very clever,
    wasn't it? I can't imagine how it was done!

    The M. in E.D. (in whom the memory of his desecrated hat
    is still rankling). Oh, can't you? Simplest thing in the
    world       any child could do it!

    Second Lady. What, find the rabbit inside those
    boxes, when they were all corded up, and sealed!

    The M. in E.D. You don't mean to say you were taken
    in by that? Why, it was another rabbit, of
    course! a name="page240"
       id="page240">[pg 240]

    First Lady. But even if it was another rabbit,
    it was wearing the borrowed watch round its neck.

    The M. in E. D. Easy enough to slip the watch in, if
    all the boxes have false bottoms.

    Second L. Yes, but he passed the boxes round for us
    to examine.

    The M. in E. D. Boxes       but not those
    boxes.

    First L. But how could he slip the watch in when
    somebody was holding it all the time in a paper bag?

    The M. in E. D. Ah, I saw how it was
    done       but it would take too long to explain it now. I
    have seen it so well performed that you couldn't
    spot it. But this chap's a regular duffer!

    disturbing). Lyties and Shentilmans, I see zere is von

    my leedle dricks is done. Now       suddenly abandoning his

    distrack the attention of the orjonce from what is going on
    upon the Stige; naterally so, because it prevents you from
    follerin' my actions too closely, and so I now call upon this

    louder than what he 'as been doin', so that you will be enabled
    to 'ear hevery word of his hexplanation more puffickly than

    ROBERT AT BURN'EM BEACHES.

    They is still so jolly busy at the "Grand" that I had sum
    differculty in getting leaf of habsense for Satterday, larst
    week, for to go with a werry seleck Copperashun Party on a most
    himportent hexcurshun to Burn'em Beaches about cuttin all the
    trees down, so that then it woodn't be not Burn'em Beaches not
    no longer! Howewer, by promisin for to stick to the "Grand" all
    thro' the cumming Winter, the too Gentelmanly Managers let me
    go.

    The fust thing as summat staggered me, in a long day of
    staggerers, was the fack, that all the hole Party had a grand
    Royal Saloon all to theirselves for to take them to Slough, but
    my estonishment ceased when I saw that they was Chairmaned by
    the same "King of good fellers" as took 'em all to Ship Lake on
    a prewious ocasion. They didn't have not no refreshments all
    the way to Slough, so they was naterally all pretty well harf
    starved by the time they got there, but there they found a
    lovly Shampane Lunshon a waiting for to refresh xhawsted Natur,
    and at it they went like One o'Clock altho it wasn't only arf
    parst Elewen. Now for the second staggerer! One of the party, a
    rayther antient Deputty, insted of jining the rest of the
    Party, declared his intenshun to take his Lunch off the
    Sunshine which was shining most brillient outside the room, and
    acordingly off he set a warking up and down in it for three
    quorters of a hour, without not no wittels nor no drink! till
    "the King of all good fellers" coodn't stand it not no longer,
    and sent me out to him with sum sangwidges and a bottel of
    Sham. He woodn't not touch no sangwidges, and ony took one
    glass of wine, and told me to put by the bottel for his dinner,
    which I did in course; but somehows, when he arsked for it
    arterwards, the cork had got out, and the wine had got out, but
    I thinks I can wenture to say as that not one drop of it was
    wasted, and werry good it was too.

    We then set out on our luvly drive, me on the box-seat of
    one of the Carridges, and the other pore fellers cramped up
    hinside. Sumhows or other, weather it was hoeing to the nobel
    Lunch or not, I don't kno, we lost our way, and found ourselves
    at larst, not where we all wanted to be, but at a most
    bewtifool House of call, where they has the werry sensebel
    custom that, when they thinks as wisiters has had enuff drink,
    they won't let 'em have not a Drop More, and that is acshally
    the name by which the ouse is known, both far and wide! Whether
    it's a good plan for the howse, in course I don't kno, but Mr.
    FOURBES, the souperintendent of the Beeches, says as nothink
    woodn't injuice 'em to alter the name. Whether that singler
    custom had anythink to do with it I don't kno, but our party
    didn't stay there long, and we soon found ourselves at
    bewtifool Burn'em Beaches.

    In course I didn't intrewde myself when they was a settling
    of the himportant bizziness as they was cum about, so I
    strolled off to a little willage as I seed in the distance, and
    which is acshally called Egipt, tho it ain't much bigger than
    Whetstone Park, Hobern, the ome of my herly birth! From a
    rayther hurryed conwersashun with a real Native, I gathered the
    himportant fack that the one reason why all the great big Beach
    Trees of the Forest had had their tops cut off, was, that
    OLIWER CROMWEEL wanted the bows for his sojers to carry, so as
    to make 'em look more than they was when he marched at their
    Hed to the Seege of Winsor Carsel! What curius and hinteresting
    hinformashun we can get from the werry humblest of our Feller
    Creturs when we goes the rite way to git it!

    I got back to the Party jest as they had cum to the werry
    senserbil reserlushun that Nowember was not at all the best
    munth to see whether Trees was really dead, or was ony
    shamming, so they determined, like true patriots as they is, to
    adjourn the matter till the 1st of next April, by which time
    they woud be able to decide.

    On our way back to Slough they all got out to see Stoke
    Pogies Church, where some great Poet was buried long long ago,
    who had wrote a most lovely Poem there, all about what could be
    seen from the Churchyard of an evening, and one of the party
    said, that the sperrit of the bewtifool seen and of the luvly
    Poem was so strong upon him, that, if they woud stand round the
    Toom, he woud try to recite some of its sweetest lines, and he
    did so, and I heard one on 'em say, as we was a driving back,
    that more than one among them had his eyes filled with plessant
    tears as he lissened. Ah, it isn't for a pore Waiter like me to
    write on these matters, but I hopes as I don't offend not
    anybody when I says, that praps if jest a leetle more pains was
    taken for to make us pore fellers understand, and feel, and
    share in the rapshur as such poems seems to inspire in our
    betters, it might help to smooth, if not to shorten, the long
    dreary road as lies between the Hignorant and the
    Heddicated.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
