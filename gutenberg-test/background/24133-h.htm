      <i>The shade of those our days that had no tongue.</i> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <h2>
      I
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was last winter, after a twelve years' absence from New York, that I
      saw again, at one of the Jim Cumnors' dinners, my old friend Halston
      Merrick.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cumnors' house is one of the few where, even after such a lapse of
      time, one can be sure of finding familiar faces and picking up old
      threads; where for a moment one can abandon one's self to the illusion
      that New York humanity is a shade less unstable than its bricks and
      mortar. And that evening in particular I remember feeling that there could
      be no pleasanter way of re-entering the confused and careless world to
      which I was returning than through the quiet softly-lit diningroom in
      which Mrs. Cumnor, with a characteristic sense of my needing to be broken
      in gradually, had contrived to assemble so many friendly faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was glad to see them all, including the three or four I did not know, or
      failed to recognize, but had no difficulty in passing as in the tradition
      and of the group; but I was most of all glad&mdash;as I rather wonderingly
      found&mdash;to set eyes again on Halston Merrick.
    </p>
    <p>
      He and I had been at Harvard together, for one thing, and had shared there
      curiosities and ardours a little outside the current tendencies: had, on
      the whole, been more critical than our comrades, and less amenable to the
      accepted. Then, for the next following years, Merrick had been a vivid and
      promising figure in young American life. Handsome, careless, and free, he
      had wandered and tasted and compared. After leaving Harvard he had spent
      two years at Oxford; then he had accepted a private secretaryship to our
      Ambassador in England, and had come back from this adventure with a fresh
      curiosity about public affairs at home, and the conviction that men of his
      kind should play a larger part in them. This led, first, to his running
      for a State Senatorship which he failed to get, and ultimately to a few
      months of intelligent activity in a municipal office. Soon after being
      deprived of this post by a change of party he had published a small volume
      of delicate verse, and, a year later, an odd uneven brilliant book on
      Municipal Government. After that one hardly knew where to look for his
      next appearance; but chance rather disappointingly solved the problem by
      killing off his father and placing Halston at the head of the Merrick Iron
      Foundry at Yonkers.
    </p>
    <p>
      His friends had gathered that, whenever this regrettable contingency
      should occur, he meant to dispose of the business and continue his life of
      free experiment. As often happens in just such cases, however, it was not
      the moment for a sale, and Merrick had to take over the management of the
      foundry. Some two years later he had a chance to free himself; but when it
      came he did not choose to take it. This tame sequel to an inspiriting
      start was disappointing to some of us, and I was among those disposed to
      regret Merrick's drop to the level of the prosperous. Then I went away to
      a big engineering job in China, and from there to Africa, and spent the
      next twelve years out of sight and sound of New York doings.
    </p>
    <p>
      During that long interval I heard of no new phase in Merrick's evolution,
      but this did not surprise me, as I had never expected from him actions
      resonant enough to cross the globe. All I knew&mdash;and this did surprise
      me&mdash;was that he had not married, and that he was still in the iron
      business. All through those years, however, I never ceased to wish, in
      certain situations and at certain turns of thought, that Merrick were in
      reach, that I could tell this or that to Merrick. I had never, in the
      interval, found any one with just his quickness of perception and just his
      sureness of response.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner, therefore, we irresistibly drew together. In Mrs. Cumnor's
      big easy drawing-room cigars were allowed, and there was no break in the
      communion of the sexes; and, this being the case, I ought to have sought a
      seat beside one of the ladies among whom we were allowed to remain. But,
      as had generally happened of old when Merrick was in sight, I found myself
      steering straight for him past all minor ports of call.
    </p>
    <p>
      There had been no time, before dinner, for more than the barest expression
      of satisfaction at meeting, and our seats had been at opposite ends of the
      longish table, so that we got our first real look at each other in the
      secluded corner to which Mrs. Cumnor's vigilance now directed us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Merrick was still handsome in his stooping tawny way: handsomer perhaps,
      with thinnish hair and more lines in his face, than in the young excess of
      his good looks. He was very glad to see me and conveyed his gladness by
      the same charming smile; but as soon as we began to talk I felt a change.
      It was not merely the change that years and experience and altered values
      bring. There was something more fundamental the matter with Merrick,
      something dreadful, unforeseen, unaccountable: Merrick had grown
      conventional and dull.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the glow of his frank pleasure in seeing me I was ashamed to analyze
      the nature of the change; but presently our talk began to flag&mdash;fancy
      a talk with Merrick flagging!&mdash;and self-deception became impossible
      as I watched myself handing out platitudes with the gesture of the
      salesman offering something to a purchaser "equally good." The worst of it
      was that Merrick&mdash;Merrick, who had once felt everything!&mdash;didn't
      seem to feel the lack of spontaneity in my remarks, but hung on' them with
      a harrowing faith in the resuscitating power of our past. It was as if he
      hugged the empty vessel of our friendship without perceiving that the last
      drop of its essence was dry.
    </p>
    <p>
      But after all, I am exaggerating. Through my surprise and disappointment I
      felt a certain sense of well-being in the mere physical presence of my old
      friend. I liked looking at the way his dark hair waved away from the
      forehead, at the tautness of his dry brown cheek, the thoughtful backward
      tilt of his head, the way his brown eyes mused upon the scene through
      lowered lids. All the past was in his way of looking and sitting, and I
      wanted to stay near him, and felt that he wanted me to stay; but the devil
      of it was that neither of us knew what to talk about.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was this difficulty which caused me, after a while, since I could not
      follow Merrick's talk, to follow his eyes in their roaming circuit of the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the moment when our glances joined, his had paused on a lady seated at
      some distance from our corner. Immersed, at first, in the satisfaction of
      finding myself again with Merrick, I had been only half aware of this
      lady, as of one of the few persons present whom I did not know, or had
      failed to remember. There was nothing in her appearance to challenge my
      attention or to excite my curiosity, and I don't suppose I should have
      looked at her again if I had not noticed that my friend was doing so.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was a woman of about forty-seven, with fair faded hair and a young
      figure. Her gray dress was handsome but ineffective, and her pale and
      rather serious face wore a small unvarying smile which might have been
      pinned on with her ornaments. She was one of the women in whom increasing
      years show rather what they have taken than what they have bestowed, and
      only on looking closely did one see that what they had taken must have
      been good of its kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Phil Cumnor and another man were talking to her, and the very intensity of
      the attention she bestowed on them betrayed the straining of rebellious
      thoughts. She never let her eyes stray or her smile drop; and at the
      proper moment I saw she was ready with the proper sentiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The party, like most of those that Mrs. Cumnor gathered about her, was not
      composed of exceptional beings. The people of the old vanished New York
      set were not exceptional: they were mostly cut on the same convenient and
      unobtrusive pattern; but they were often exceedingly "nice." And this
      obsolete quality marked every look and gesture of the lady I was
      scrutinizing.
    </p>
    <p>
      While these reflections were passing through my mind I was aware that
      Merrick's eyes rested still on her. I took a cross-section of his look and
      found in it neither surprise nor absorption, but only a certain sober
      pleasure just about at the emotional level of the rest of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      If he continued to look at her, his expression seemed to say, it was only
      because, all things considered, there were fewer reasons for looking at
      anybody else.
    </p>
    <p>
      This made me wonder what were the reasons for looking at <i>her</i>; and
      as a first step toward enlightenment I said:&mdash;"I'm sure I've seen the
      lady over there in gray&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Merrick detached his eyes and turned them on me with a wondering look.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Seen her? You know her." He waited. "<i>Don't</i> you know her? It's Mrs.
      Reardon."
    </p>
    <p>
      I wondered that he should wonder, for I could not remember, in the Cumnor
      group or elsewhere, having known any one of the name he mentioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But perhaps," he continued, "you hadn't heard of her marriage? You knew
      her as Mrs. Trant."
    </p>
    <p>
      I gave him back his stare. "Not Mrs. Philip Trant?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; Mrs. Philip Trant."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not Paulina?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;Paulina," he said, with a just perceptible delay before the
      name.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my surprise I continued to stare at him. He averted his eyes from mine
      after a moment, and I saw that they had strayed back to her. "You find her
      so changed?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something in his voice acted as a warning signal, and I tried to reduce my
      astonishment to less unbecoming proportions. "I don't find that she looks
      much older."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. Only different?" he suggested, as if there were nothing new to him in
      my perplexity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;awfully different."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose we're all awfully different. To you, I mean&mdash;coming from
      so far?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I recognized all the rest of you," I said, hesitating. "And she used to
      be the one who stood out most."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a flash, a wave, a stir of something deep down in his eyes.
      "Yes," he said. "<i>That's</i> the difference."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see it is. She&mdash;she looks worn down. Soft but blurred, like the
      figures in that tapestry behind her."
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced at her again, as if to test the exactness of my analogy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Life wears everybody down," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;except those it makes more distinct. They're the rare ones, of
      course; but she <i>was</i> rare."
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood up suddenly, looking old and tired. "I believe I'll be off. I
      wish you'd come down to my place for Sunday.... No, don't shake hands&mdash;I
      want to slide away unawares."
    </p>
    <p>
      He had backed away to the threshold and was turning the noiseless
      door-knob. Even Mrs. Cumnor's doorknobs had tact and didn't tell.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course I'll come," I promised warmly. In the last ten minutes he had
      begun to interest me again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right Good-bye." Half through the door he paused to add:&mdash;"<i>She</i>
      remembers you. You ought to speak to her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm going to. But tell me a little more." I thought I saw a shade of
      constraint on his face, and did not add, as I had meant to: "Tell me&mdash;because
      she interests me&mdash;what wore her down?" Instead, I asked: "How soon
      after Trant's death did she remarry?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed to make an effort of memory. "It was seven years ago, I think."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And is Reardon here to-night?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; over there, talking to Mrs. Cumnor."
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked across the broken groupings and saw a large glossy man with
      straw-coloured hair and a red face, whose shirt and shoes and complexion
      seemed all to have received a coat of the same expensive varnish.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I looked there was a drop in the talk about us, and I heard Mr. Reardon
      pronounce in a big booming voice: "What I say is: what's the good of
      disturbing things? Thank the Lord, I'm content with what I've got!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is <i>that</i> her husband? What's he like?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, the best fellow in the world," said Merrick, going.

    <h2>
      II
    </h2>
    <p>
      Merrick had a little place at Riverdale, where he went occasionally to be
      near the Iron Works, and where he hid his week-ends when the world was too
      much with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, on the following Saturday afternoon I found him awaiting me in a
      pleasant setting of books and prints and faded parental furniture.
    </p>
    <p>
      We dined late, and smoked and talked afterward in his book-walled study
      till the terrier on the hearth-rug stood up and yawned for bed. When we
      took the hint and moved toward the staircase I felt, not that I had found
      the old Merrick again, but that I was on his track, had come across traces
      of his passage here and there in the thick jungle that had grown up
      between us. But I had a feeling that when I finally came on the man
      himself he might be dead....
    </p>
    <p>
      As we started upstairs he turned back with one of his abrupt shy
      movements, and walked into the study.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait a bit!" he called to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I waited, and he came out in a moment carrying a limp folio.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's typewritten. Will you take a look at it? I've been trying to get to
      work again," he explained, thrusting the manuscript into my hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What? Poetry, I hope?" I exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head with a gleam of derision. "No&mdash;just general
      considerations. The fruit of fifty years of inexperience."
    </p>
    <p>
      He showed me to my room and said good-night.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The following afternoon we took a long walk inland, across the hills, and
      I said to Merrick what I could of his book. Unluckily there wasn't much to
      say. The essays were judicious, polished and cultivated; but they lacked
      the freshness and audacity of his youthful work. I tried to conceal my
      opinion behind the usual generalisations, but he broke through these
      feints with a quick thrust to the heart of my meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's worn down&mdash;blurred? Like the figures in the Cumnors' tapestry?"
    </p>
    <p>
      I hesitated. "It's a little too damned resigned," I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," he exclaimed, "so am I. Resigned." He switched the bare brambles by
      the roadside. "A man can't serve two masters."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean business and literature?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; I mean theory and instinct. The gray tree and the green. You've got
      to choose which fruit you'll try; and you don't know till afterward which
      of the two has the dead core."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How can anybody be sure that only one of them has?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sure," said Merrick sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      We turned back to the subject of his essays, and I was astonished at the
      detachment with which he criticised and demolished them. Little by little,
      as we talked, his old perspective, his old standards came back to him; but
      with the difference that they no longer seemed like functions of his mind
      but merely like attitudes assumed or dropped at will. He could still, with
      an effort, put himself at the angle from which he had formerly seen
      things; but it was with the effort of a man climbing mountains after a
      sedentary life in the plain.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tried to cut the talk short, but he kept coming back to it with nervous
      insistence, forcing me into the last retrenchments of hypocrisy, and
      anticipating the verdict I held back. I perceived that a great deal&mdash;immensely
      more than I could see a reason for&mdash;had hung for him on my opinion of
      his book.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, as suddenly, his insistence dropped and, as if ashamed of having
      forced, himself so long on my attention, he began to talk rapidly and
      uninterestingly of other things.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were alone again that evening, and after dinner, wishing to efface the
      impression of the afternoon, and above all to show that I wanted him to
      talk about himself, I reverted to his work. "You must need an outlet of
      that sort. When a man's once had it in him, as you have&mdash;and when
      other things begin to dwindle&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed. "Your theory is that a man ought to be able to return to the
      Muse as he comes back to his wife after he's ceased to interest other
      women?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; as he comes back to his wife after the day's work is done." A new
      thought came to me as I looked at him. "You ought to have had one," I
      added.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed again. "A wife, you mean? So that there'd have been some one
      waiting for me even if the Muse decamped?" He went on after a pause: "I've
      a notion that the kind of woman worth coming back to wouldn't be much more
      patient than the Muse. But as it happens I never tried&mdash;because, for
      fear they'd chuck me, I put them both out of doors together."
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned his head and looked past me with a queer expression at the low
      panelled door at my back. "Out of that very door they went&mdash;the two
      of 'em, on a rainy night like this: and one stopped and looked back, to
      see if I wasn't going to call her&mdash;and I didn't&mdash;and so they
      both went...."

    <p>
      "The Muse?" (said Merrick, refilling my glass and stooping to pat the
      terrier as he went back to his chair)&mdash;"well, you've met the Muse in
      the little volume of sonnets you used to like; and you've met the woman
      too, and you used to like <i>her</i>; though you didn't know her when you
      saw her the other evening....
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I won't ask you how she struck you when you talked to her: I know.
      She struck you like that stuff I gave you to read last night She's
      conformed&mdash;I've conformed&mdash;the mills have caught us and ground
      us: ground us, oh, exceedingly small!
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you remember what she was; and that's the reason why I'm telling you
      this now....
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may recall that after my father's death I tried to sell the Works. I
      was impatient to free myself from anything that would keep me tied to New
      York. I don't dislike my trade, and I've made, in the end, a fairly good
      thing of it; but industrialism was not, at that time, in the line of my
      tastes, and I know now that it wasn't what I was meant for. Above all, I
      wanted to get away, to see new places and rub up against different ideas.
      I had reached a time of life&mdash;the top of the first hill, so to speak&mdash;where
      the distance draws one, and everything in the foreground seems tame and
      stale. I was sick to death of the particular set of conformities I had
      grown up among; sick of being a pleasant popular young man with a long
      line of dinners on my list, and the dead certainty of meeting the same
      people, or their prototypes, at all of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well&mdash;I failed to sell the Works, and that increased my discontent.
      I went through moods of cold unsociability, alternating with sudden
      flushes of curiosity, when I gloated over stray scraps of talk overheard
      in railway stations and omnibuses, when strange faces that I passed in the
      street tantalized me with fugitive promises. I wanted to be among things
      that were unexpected and unknown; and it seemed to me that nobody about me
      understood in the least what I felt, but that somewhere just out of reach
      there was some one who <i>did</i>, and whom I must find or despair....
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was just then that, one evening, I saw Mrs. Trant for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes: I know&mdash;you wonder what I mean. I'd known her, of course, as a
      girl; I'd met her several times after her marriage; and I'd lately been
      thrown with her, quite intimately and continuously, during a succession of
      country-house visits. But I had never, as it happened, really <i>seen</i>
      her....
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was at a dinner at the Cumnors'; and there she was, in front of the
      very tapestry we saw her against the other evening, with people about her,
      and her face turned from me, and nothing noticeable or different in her
      dress or manner; and suddenly she stood out for me against the familiar
      unimportant background, and for the first time I saw a meaning in the
      stale phrase of a picture's walking out of its frame. For, after all, most
      people <i>are</i> just that to us: pictures, furniture, the inanimate
      accessories of our little island-area of sensation. And then sometimes one
      of these graven images moves and throws out live filaments toward us, and
      the line they make draws us across the world as the moon-track seems to
      draw a boat across the water....
    </p>
    <p>
      "There she stood; and as this queer sensation came over me I felt that she
      was looking steadily at me, that her eyes were voluntarily, consciously
      resting on me with the weight of the very question I was asking.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I went over and joined her, and she turned and walked with me into the
      music-room. Earlier in the evening some one had been singing, and there
      were low lights there, and a few couples still sitting in those
      confidential corners of which Mrs. Cumnor has the art; but we were under
      no illusion as to the nature of these presences. We knew that they were
      just painted in, and that the whole of life was in us two, flowing back
      and forward between us. We talked, of course; we had the attitudes, even
      the words, of the others: I remember her telling me her plans for the
      spring and asking me politely about mine! As if there were the least sense
      in plans, now that this thing had happened!
    </p>
    <p>
      "When we went back into the drawing-room I had said nothing to her that I
      might not have said to any other woman of the party; but when we shook
      hands I knew we should meet the next day&mdash;and the next....
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's the way, I take it, that Nature has arranged the beginning of the
      great enduring loves; and likewise of the little epidermal flurries. And
      how is a man to know where he is going?
    </p>
    <p>
      "From the first my feeling for Paulina Trant seemed to me a grave
      business; but then the Enemy is given to producing that illusion. Many a
      man&mdash;I'm talking of the kind with imagination&mdash;has thought he
      was seeking a soul when all he wanted was a closer view of its tenement.
      And I tried&mdash;honestly tried&mdash;to make myself think I was in the
      latter case. Because, in the first place, I didn't, just then, want a big
      disturbing influence in my life; and because I didn't want to be a dupe;
      and because Paulina Trant was not, according to hearsay, the kind of woman
      for whom it was worth while to bring up the big batteries....
    </p>
    <p>
      "But my resistance was only half-hearted. What I really felt&mdash;<i>all</i>
      I really felt&mdash;was the flood of joy that comes of heightened emotion.
      She had given me that, and I wanted her to give it to me again. That's as
      near as I've ever come to analyzing my state in the beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I knew her story, as no doubt you know it: the current version, I mean.
      She had been poor and fond of enjoyment, and she had married that pompous
      stick Philip Trant because she needed a home, and perhaps also because she
      wanted a little luxury. Queer how we sneer at women for wanting the thing
      that gives them half their attraction!
    </p>
    <p>
      "People shook their heads over the marriage, and divided, prematurely,
      into Philip's partisans and hers: for no one thought it would work. And
      they were almost disappointed when, after all, it did. She and her wooden
      consort seemed to get on well enough. There was a ripple, at one time,
      over her friendship with young Jim Dalham, who was always with her during
      a summer at Newport and an autumn in Italy; then the talk died out, and
      she and Trant were seen together, as before, on terms of apparent
      good-fellowship.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This was the more surprising because, from the first, Paulina had never
      made the least attempt to change her tone or subdue her colours. In the
      gray Trant atmosphere she flashed with prismatic fires. She smoked, she
      talked subversively, she did as she liked and went where she chose, and
      danced over the Trant prejudices and the Trant principles as if they'd
      been a ball-room floor; and all without apparent offence to her solemn
      husband and his cloud of cousins. I believe her frankness and directness
      struck them dumb. She moved like a kind of primitive Una through the
      virtuous rout, and never got a finger-mark on her freshness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One of the finest things about her was the fact that she never, for an
      instant, used her situation as a means of enhancing her attraction. With a
      husband like Trant it would have been so easy! He was a man who always saw
      the small sides of big things. He thought most of life compressible into a
      set of by-laws and the rest unmentionable; and with his stiff frock-coated
      and tall-hatted mind, instinctively distrustful of intelligences in
      another dress, with his arbitrary classification of whatever he didn't
      understand into 'the kind of thing I don't approve of,' 'the kind of thing
      that isn't done,' and&mdash;deepest depth of all&mdash;'the kind of thing
      I'd rather not discuss,' he lived in bondage to a shadowy moral etiquette
      of which the complex rites and awful penalties had cast an abiding gloom
      upon his manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A woman like his wife couldn't have asked a better foil; yet I'm sure she
      never consciously used his dullness to relieve her brilliancy. She may
      have felt that the case spoke for itself. But I believe her reserve was
      rather due to a lively sense of justice, and to the rare habit (you said
      she was rare) of looking at facts as they are, without any throwing of
      sentimental lime-lights. She knew Trant could no more help being Trant
      than she could help being herself&mdash;and there was an end of it. I've
      never known a woman who 'made up' so little mentally....
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps her very reserve, the fierceness of her implicit rejection of
      sympathy, exposed her the more to&mdash;well, to what happened when we
      met. She said afterward that it was like having been shut up for months in
      the hold of a ship, and coming suddenly on deck on a day that was all
      flying blue and silver....
    </p>
    <p>
      "I won't try to tell you what she was. It's easier to tell you what her
      friendship made of me; and I can do that best by adopting her metaphor of
      the ship. Haven't you, sometimes, at the moment of starting on a journey,
      some glorious plunge into the unknown, been tripped up by the thought: 'If
      only one hadn't to come back'? Well, with her one had the sense that one
      would never have to come back; that the magic ship, would always carry one
      farther. And what an air one breathed on it! And, oh, the wind, and the
      islands, and the sunsets!
    </p>
    <p>
      "I said just now 'her friendship'; and I used the word advisedly. Love is
      deeper than friendship, but friendship is a good deal wider. The beauty of
      our relation was that it included both dimensions. Our thoughts met as
      naturally as our eyes: it was almost as if we loved each other because we
      liked each other. The quality of a love may be tested by the amount of
      friendship it contains, and in our case there was no dividing line between
      loving and liking, no disproportion between them, no barrier against which
      desire beat in vain or from which thought fell back unsatisfied. Ours was
      a robust passion that could give an open-eyed account of itself, and not a
      beautiful madness shrinking away from the proof....
    </p>
    <p>
      "For the first months friendship sufficed us, or rather gave us so much by
      the way that we were in no hurry to reach what we knew it was leading to.
      But we were moving there nevertheless, and one day we found ourselves on
      the borders. It came about through a sudden decision of Trant's to start
      on a long tour with his wife. We had never foreseen that: he seemed rooted
      in his New York habits and convinced that the whole social and financial
      machinery of the metropolis would cease to function if he did not keep an
      eye on it through the columns of his morning paper, and pronounce judgment
      on it in the afternoon at his club. But something new had happened to him:
      he caught a cold, which was followed by a touch of pleurisy, and instantly
      he perceived the intense interest and importance which ill-health may add
      to life. He took the fullest advantage of it. A discerning doctor
      recommended travel in a warm climate; and suddenly, the morning paper, the
      afternoon club, Fifth Avenue, Wall Street, all the complex phenomena of
      the metropolis, faded into insignificance, and the rest of the terrestrial
      globe, from being a mere geographical hypothesis, useful in enabling one
      to determine the latitude of New York, acquired reality and magnitude as a
      factor in the convalescence of Mr. Philip Trant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "His wife was absorbed in preparations for the journey. To move him was
      like mobilizing an army, and weeks before the date set for their departure
      it was almost as if she were already gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This foretaste of separation showed us what we were to each other. Yet I
      was letting her go&mdash;and there was no help for it, no way of
      preventing it. Resistance was as useless as the vain struggles in a
      nightmare. She was Trant's and not mine: part of his luggage when he
      travelled as she was part of his household furniture when he stayed at
      home....
    </p>
    <p>
      "The day she told me that their passages were taken&mdash;it was on a
      November afternoon, in her drawing-room in town&mdash;I turned away from
      her and, going to the window, stood looking out at the torrent of traffic
      interminably pouring down Fifth Avenue. I watched the senseless machinery
      of life revolving in the rain and mud, and tried to picture myself
      performing my small function in it after she had gone from me.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'It can't be&mdash;it can't be!' I exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'What can't be?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "I came back into the room and sat down by her. 'This&mdash;this&mdash;' I
      hadn't any words. 'Two weeks!' I said. 'What's two weeks?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She answered, vaguely, something about their thinking of Spain for the
      spring&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Two weeks&mdash;two weeks!' I repeated. 'And the months we've lost&mdash;the
      days that belonged to us!'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Yes,' she said, 'I'm thankful it's settled.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Our words seemed irrelevant, haphazard. It was as if each were answering
      a secret voice, and not what the other was saying.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Don't you <i>feel</i> anything at all?' I remember bursting out at her.
      As I asked it the tears were streaming down her face. I felt angry with
      her, and was almost glad to note that her lids were red and that she
      didn't cry becomingly. I can't express my sensation to you except by
      saying that she seemed part of life's huge league against me. And suddenly
      I thought of an afternoon we had spent together in the country, on a ferny
      hill-side, when we had sat under a beech-tree, and her hand had lain palm
      upward in the moss, close to mine, and I had watched a little
      black-and-red beetle creeping over it....
    </p>
    <p>
      "The bell rang, and we heard the voice of a visitor and the click of an
      umbrella in the umbrella-stand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She rose to go into the inner drawing-room, and I caught her suddenly by
      the wrist. 'You understand,' I said, 'that we can't go on like this?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I understand,' she answered, and moved away to meet her visitor. As I
      went out I heard her saying in the other room: 'Yes, we're really off on
      the twelfth.'"

    </h2>
    <p>
      "I wrote her a long letter that night, and waited two days for a reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "On the third day I had a brief line saying that she was going to spend
      Sunday with some friends who had a place near Riverdale, and that she
      would arrange to see me while she was there. That was all.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was on a Saturday that I received the note and I came out here the
      same night. The next morning was rainy, and I was in despair, for I had
      counted on her asking me to take her for a drive or a long walk. It was
      hopeless to try to say what I had to say to her in the drawing-room of a
      crowded country-house. And only eleven days were left!
    </p>
    <p>
      "I stayed indoors all the morning, fearing to go out lest she should
      telephone me. But no sign came, and I grew more and more restless and
      anxious. She was too free and frank for coquetry, but her silence and
      evasiveness made me feel that, for some reason, she did not wish to hear
      what she knew I meant to say. Could it be that she was, after all, more
      conventional, less genuine, than I had thought? I went again and again
      over the whole maddening round of conjecture; but the only conclusion I
      could rest in was that, if she loved me as I loved her, she would be as
      determined as I was to let no obstacle come between us during the days
      that were left.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The luncheon-hour came and passed, and there was no word from her. I had
      ordered my trap to be ready, so that I might drive over as soon as she
      summoned me; but the hours dragged on, the early twilight came, and I sat
      here in this very chair, or measured up and down, up and down, the length
      of this very rug&mdash;and still there was no message and no letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It had grown quite dark, and I had ordered away, impatiently, the servant
      who came in with the lamps: I couldn't <i>bear</i> any definite sign that
      the day was over! And I was standing there on the rug, staring at the
      door, and noticing a bad crack in its panel, when I heard the sound of
      wheels on the gravel. A word at last, no doubt&mdash;a line to explain....
      I didn't seem to care much for her reasons, and I stood where I was and
      continued to stare at the door. And suddenly it opened and she came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The servant followed her with a light, and then went out and closed the
      door. Her face looked pale in the lamplight, but her voice was as clear as
      a bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Well,' she said, 'you see I've come.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "I started toward her with hands outstretched. 'You've come&mdash;you've
      come!' I stammered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; it was like her to come in that way&mdash;without dissimulation or
      explanation or excuse. It was like her, if she gave at all, to give not
      furtively or in haste, but openly, deliberately, without stinting the
      measure or counting the cost. But her quietness and serenity disconcerted
      me. She did not look like a woman who has yielded impetuously to an
      uncontrollable impulse. There was something almost solemn in her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The effect of it stole over me as I looked at her, suddenly subduing the
      huge flush of gratified longing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'You're here, here, here!' I kept repeating, like a child singing over a
      happy word.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'You said,' she continued, in her grave clear voice, 'that we couldn't go
      on as we were&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Ah, it's divine of you!' I held out my arms to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She didn't draw back from them, but her faint smile said, 'Wait,' and
      lifting her hands she took the pins from her hat, and laid the hat on the
      table.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As I saw her dear head bare in the lamp-light, with the thick hair waving
      away from the parting, I forgot everything but the bliss and wonder of her
      being here&mdash;here, in my house, on my hearth&mdash;that fourth rose
      from the corner of the rug is the exact spot where she was standing....
    </p>
    <p>
      "I drew her to the fire, and made her sit down in the chair you're in, and
      knelt down by her, and hid my face on her knees. She put her hand on my
      head, and I was happy to the depths of my soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Oh, I forgot&mdash;' she exclaimed suddenly. I lifted my head and our
      eyes met. Hers were smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She reached out her hand, opened the little bag she had tossed down with
      her hat, and drew a small object from it. 'I left my trunk at the station.
      Here's the check. Can you send for it?' she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Her trunk&mdash;she wanted me to send for her trunk! Oh, yes&mdash;I see
      your smile, your 'lucky man!' Only, you see, I didn't love her in that
      way. I knew she couldn't come to my house without running a big risk of
      discovery, and my tenderness for her, my impulse to shield her, was
      stronger, even then, than vanity or desire. Judged from the point of view
      of those emotions I fell terribly short of my part. I hadn't any of the
      proper feelings. Such an act of romantic folly was so unlike her that it
      almost irritated me, and I found myself desperately wondering how I could
      get her to reconsider her plan without&mdash;well, without seeming to want
      her to.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's not the way a novel hero feels; it's probably not the way a man in
      real life ought to have felt. But it's the way I felt&mdash;and she saw
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She put her hands on my shoulders and looked at me with deep, deep eyes.
      'Then you didn't expect me to stay?' she asked.

      "I caught her hands and pressed them to me, stammering out that I hadn't
      dared to dream....
    </p>
    <p>
      "'You thought I'd come&mdash;just for an hour?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'How could I dare think more? I adore you, you know, for what you've
      done! But it would be known if you&mdash;if you stayed on. My servants&mdash;everybody
      about here knows you. I've no right to expose you to the risk.' She made
      no answer, and I went on tenderly: 'Give me, if you will, the next few
      hours: there's a train that will get you to town by midnight. And then
      we'll arrange something&mdash;in town&mdash;where it's safer for you&mdash;more
      easily managed.... It's beautiful, it's heavenly of you to have come; but
      I love you too much&mdash;I must take care of you and think for you&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't suppose it ever took me so long to say so few words, and though
      they were profoundly sincere they sounded unutterably shallow, irrelevant
      and grotesque. She made no effort to help me out, but sat silent,
      listening, with her meditative smile. 'It's my duty, dearest, as a man,' I
      rambled on. The more I love you the more I'm bound&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Yes; but you don't understand,' she interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She rose as she spoke, and I got up also, and we stood and looked at each
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I haven't come for a night; if you want me I've come for always,' she
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here again, if I give you an honest account of my feelings I shall write
      myself down as the poor-spirited creature I suppose I am. There wasn't, I
      swear, at the moment, a grain of selfishness, of personal reluctance, in
      my feeling. I worshipped every hair of her head&mdash;when we were
      together I was happy, when I was away from her something was gone from
      every good thing; but I had always looked on our love for each other, our
      possible relation to each other, as such situations are looked on in what
      is called society. I had supposed her, for all her freedom and
      originality, to be just as tacitly subservient to that view as I was:
      ready to take what she wanted on the terms on which society concedes such
      taking, and to pay for it by the usual restrictions, concealments and
      hypocrisies. In short, I supposed that she would 'play the game'&mdash;look
      out for her own safety, and expect me to look out for it. It sounds cheap
      enough, put that way&mdash;but it's the rule we live under, all of us. And
      the amazement of finding her suddenly outside of it, oblivious of it,
      unconscious of it, left me, for an awful minute, stammering at her like a
      graceless dolt.... Perhaps it wasn't even a minute; but in it she had gone
      the whole round of my thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'It's raining,' she said, very low. 'I suppose you can telephone for a
      trap?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "There was no irony or resentment in her voice. She walked slowly across
      the room and paused before the Brangwyn etching over there. 'That's a good
      impression. <i>Will</i> you telephone, please?' she repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I found my voice again, and with it the power of movement. I followed her
      and dropped at her feet. 'You can't go like this!' I cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She looked down on me from heights and heights. 'I can't stay like this,'
      she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I stood up and we faced each other like antagonists. 'You don't know,' I
      accused her passionately, 'in the least what you're asking me to ask of
      you!'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Yes, I do: <i>everything</i>,' she breathed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'And it's got to be that or nothing?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Oh, on both sides,' she reminded me.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'<i>Not</i> on both sides. It's not fair. That's why&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Why you won't?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Why I cannot&mdash;may not!'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Why you'll take a night and not a life?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "The taunt, for a woman usually so sure of her aim, fell so short of the
      mark that its only effect was to increase my conviction of her
      helplessness. The very intensity of my longing for her made me tremble
      where she was fearless. I had to protect her first, and think of my own
      attitude afterward.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She was too discerning not to see this too. Her face softened, grew
      inexpressibly appealing, and she dropped again into that chair you're in,
      leaned forward, and looked up with her grave smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'You think I'm beside myself&mdash;raving? (You're not thinking of
      yourself, I know.) I'm not: I never was saner. Since I've known you I've
      often thought this might happen. This thing between us isn't an ordinary
      thing. If it had been we shouldn't, all these months, have drifted. We
      should have wanted to skip to the last page&mdash;and then throw down the
      book. We shouldn't have felt we could <i>trust</i> the future as we did.
      We were in no hurry because we knew we shouldn't get tired; and when two
      people feel that about each other they must live together&mdash;or part. I
      don't see what else they can do. A little trip along the coast won't
      answer. It's the high seas&mdash;or else being tied up to Lethe wharf. And
      I'm for the high seas, my dear!'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Think of sitting here&mdash;here, in this room, in this chair&mdash;and
      listening to that, and seeing the tight on her hair, and hearing the sound
      of her voice! I don't suppose there ever was a scene just like it....
    </p>
    <p>
      "She was astounding&mdash;inexhaustible; through all my anguish of
      resistance I found a kind of fierce joy in following her. It was lucidity
      at white heat: the last sublimation of passion. She might have been an
      angel arguing a point in the empyrean if she hadn't been, so completely, a
      woman pleading for her life....
    </p>
    <p>
      "Her life: that was the thing at stake! She couldn't do with less of it
      than she was capable of; and a woman's life is inextricably part of the
      man's she cares for.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That was why, she argued, she couldn't accept the usual solution:
      couldn't enter into the only relation that society tolerates between
      people situated like ourselves. Yes: she knew all the arguments on <i>that</i>
      side: didn't I suppose she'd been over them and over them? She knew (for
      hadn't she often said it of others?) what is said of the woman who, by
      throwing in her lot with her lover's, binds him to a lifelong duty which
      has the irksomeness without the dignity of marriage. Oh, she could talk on
      that side with the best of them: only she asked me to consider the other&mdash;the
      side of the man and woman who love each other deeply and completely enough
      to want their lives enlarged, and not diminished, by their love. What, in
      such a case&mdash;she reasoned&mdash;must be the inevitable effect of
      concealing, denying, disowning, the central fact, the motive power of
      one's existence? She asked me to picture the course of such a love: first
      working as a fever in the blood, distorting and deflecting everything,
      making all other interests insipid, all other duties irksome, and then, as
      the acknowledged claims of life regained their hold, gradually dying&mdash;the
      poor starved passion!&mdash;for want of the wholesome necessary food of
      common living and doing, yet leaving life impoverished by the loss of all
      it might have been.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I'm not talking, dear&mdash;' I see her now, leaning toward me with
      shining eyes: 'I'm not talking of the people who haven't enough to fill
      their days, and to whom a little mystery, a little manoeuvring, gives an
      illusion of importance that they can't afford to miss; I'm talking of you
      and me, with all our tastes and curiosities and activities; and I ask you
      what our love would become if we had to keep it apart from our lives, like
      a pretty useless animal that we went to peep at and feed with sweetmeats
      through its cage?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "I won't, my dear fellow, go into the other side of our strange duel: the
      arguments I used were those that most men in my situation would have felt
      bound to use, and that most women in Paulina's accept instinctively,
      without even formulating them. The exceptionalness, the significance, of
      the case lay wholly in the fact that she had formulated them all and then
      rejected them....
    </p>
    <p>
      "There was one point I didn't, of course, touch on; and that was the
      popular conviction (which I confess I shared) that when a man and a woman
      agree to defy the world together the man really sacrifices much more than
      the woman. I was not even conscious of thinking of this at the time,
      though it may have lurked somewhere in the shadow of my scruples for her;
      but she dragged it out into the daylight and held me face to face with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Remember, I'm not attempting to lay down any general rule,' she
      insisted; 'I'm not theorizing about Man and Woman, I'm talking about you
      and me. How do I know what's best for the woman in the next house? Very
      likely she'll bolt when it would have been better for her to stay at home.
      And it's the same with the man: he'll probably do the wrong thing. It's
      generally the weak heads that commit follies, when it's the strong ones
      that ought to: and my point is that you and I are both strong enough to
      behave like fools if we want to....
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Take your own case first&mdash;because, in spite of the sentimentalists,
      it's the man who stands to lose most. You'll have to give up the Iron
      Works: which you don't much care about&mdash;because it won't be
      particularly agreeable for us to live in New York: which you don't care
      much about either. But you won't be sacrificing what is called "a career."
      You made up your mind long ago that your best chance of self-development,
      and consequently of general usefulness, lay in thinking rather than doing;
      and, when we first met, you were already planning to sell out your
      business, and travel and write. Well! Those ambitions are of a kind that
      won't be harmed by your dropping out of your social setting. On the
      contrary, such work as you want to do ought to gain by it, because you'll
      be brought nearer to life-as-it-is, in contrast to
      life-as-a-visiting-list....'
    </p>
    <p>
      "She threw back her head with a sudden laugh. 'And the joy of not having
      any more visits to make! I wonder if you've ever thought of <i>that?</i>
      Just at first, I mean; for society's getting so deplorably lax that,
      little by little, it will edge up to us&mdash;you'll see! I don't want to
      idealize the situation, dearest, and I won't conceal from you that in time
      we shall be called on. But, oh, the fun we shall have had in the interval!
      And then, for the first time we shall be able to dictate our own terms,
      one of which will be that no bores need apply. Think of being cured of all
      one's chronic bores! We shall feel as jolly as people do after a
      successful operation.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know why this nonsense sticks in my mind when some of the graver
      things we said are less distinct. Perhaps it's because of a certain
      iridescent quality of feeling that made her gaiety seem like sunshine
      through a shower....
    </p>
    <p>
      "'You ask me to think of myself?' she went on. 'But the beauty of our
      being together will be that, for the first time, I shall dare to! Now I
      have to think of all the tedious trifles I can pack the days with, because
      I'm afraid&mdash;I'm afraid&mdash;to hear the voice of the real me, down
      below, in the windowless underground hole where I keep her....
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Remember again, please, it's not Woman, it's Paulina Trant, I'm talking
      of. The woman in the next house may have all sorts of reasons&mdash;honest
      reasons&mdash;for staying there. There may be some one there who needs her
      badly: for whom the light would go out if she went. Whereas to Philip I've
      been simply&mdash;well, what New York was before he decided to travel: the
      most important thing in life till he made up his mind to leave it; and now
      merely the starting-place of several lines of steamers. Oh, I didn't have
      to love you to know that! I only had to live with <i>him</i>.... If he
      lost his eye-glasses he'd think it was the fault of the eye-glasses; he'd
      really feel that the eyeglasses had been careless. And he'd be convinced
      that no others would suit him quite as well. But at the optician's he'd
      probably be told that he needed something a little different, and after
      that he'd feel that the old eye-glasses had never suited him at all, and
      that <i>that</i> was their fault too....'
    </p>
    <p>
      "At one moment&mdash;but I don't recall when&mdash;I remember she stood up
      with one of her quick movements, and came toward me, holding out her arms.
      'Oh, my dear, I'm pleading for my life; do you suppose I shall ever want
      for arguments?' she cried....
    </p>
    <p>
      "After that, for a bit, nothing much remains with me except a sense of
      darkness and of conflict. The one spot of daylight in my whirling brain
      was the conviction that I couldn't&mdash;whatever happened&mdash;profit by
      the sudden impulse she had acted on, and allow her to take, in a moment of
      passion, a decision that was to shape her whole life. I couldn't so much
      as lift my little finger to keep her with me then, unless I were prepared
      to accept for her as well as for myself the full consequences of the
      future she had planned for us....
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well&mdash;there's the point: I wasn't. I felt in her&mdash;poor fatuous
      idiot that I was!&mdash;that lack of objective imagination which had
      always seemed to me to account, at least in part, for many of the
      so-called heroic qualities in women. When their feelings are involved they
      simply can't look ahead. Her unfaltering logic notwithstanding, I felt
      this about Paulina as I listened. She had a specious air of knowing where
      she was going, but she didn't. She seemed the genius of logic and
      understanding, but the demon of illusion spoke through her lips....
    </p>
    <p>
      "I said just now that I hadn't, at the outset, given my own side of the
      case a thought. It would have been truer to say that I hadn't given it a
      <i>separate</i> thought. But I couldn't think of her without seeing myself
      as a factor&mdash;the chief factor&mdash;in her problem, and without
      recognizing that whatever the experiment made of me, that it must fatally,
      in the end, make of her. If I couldn't carry the thing through she must
      break down with me: we should have to throw our separate selves into the
      melting-pot of this mad adventure, and be 'one' in a terrible indissoluble
      completeness of which marriage is only an imperfect counterpart....
    </p>
    <p>
      "There could be no better proof of her extraordinary power over me, and of
      the way she had managed to clear the air of sentimental illusion, than the
      fact that I presently found myself putting this before her with a
      merciless precision of touch.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'If we love each other enough to do a thing like this, we must love each
      other enough to see just what it is we're going to do.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "So I invited her to the dissecting-table, and I see now the fearless eye
      with which she approached the cadaver. 'For that's what it is, you know,'
      she flashed out at me, at the end of my long demonstration. 'It's a dead
      body, like all the instances and examples and hypothetical cases that ever
      were! What do you expect to learn from thai? The first great anatomist was
      the man who stuck his knife in a heart that was beating; and the only way
      to find out what doing a thing will be like is to do it!'
    </p>
    <p>
      "She looked away from me suddenly, as if she were fixing her eyes on some
      vision on the outer rim of consciousness. 'No: there's one other way,' she
      exclaimed; 'and that is, <i>not</i> to do it! To abstain and refrain; and
      then see what we become, or what we don't become, in the long run, and to
      draw our inferences. That's the game that almost everybody about us is
      playing, I suppose; there's hardly one of the dull people one meets at
      dinner who hasn't had, just once, the chance of a berth on a ship that was
      off for the Happy Isles, and hasn't refused it for fear of sticking on a
      sand-bank!
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I'm doing my best, you know,' she continued, 'to see the sequel as you
      see it, as you believe it's your duty to me to see it. I know the
      instances you're thinking of: the listless couples wearing out their lives
      in shabby watering places, and hanging on the favour of hotel
      acquaintances; or the proud quarrelling wretches shut up alone in a fine
      house because they're too good for the only society they can get, and
      trying to cheat their boredom by squabbling with their tradesmen and
      spying on their servants. No doubt there are such cases; but I don't
      recognize either of us in those dismal figures. Why, to do it would be to
      admit that our life, yours and mine, is in the people about us and not in
      ourselves; that we're parasites and not self-sustaining creatures; and
      that the lives we're leading now are so brilliant, full and satisfying
      that what we should have to give up would surpass even the blessedness of
      being together!'
    </p>
    <p>
      "At that stage, I confess, the solid ground of my resistance began to give
      way under me. It was not that my convictions were shaken, but that she had
      swept me into a world whose laws were different, where one could reach out
      in directions that the slave of gravity hasn't pictured. But at the same
      time my opposition hardened from reason into instinct. I knew it was her
      voice, and not her logic, that was unsettling me. I knew that if she'd
      written out her thesis and sent it me by post I should have made short
      work of it; and again the part of me which I called by all the finest
      names: my chivalry, my unselfishness, my superior masculine experience,
      cried out with one voice: 'You can't let a woman use her graces to her own
      undoing&mdash;you can't, for her own sake, let her eyes convince you when
      her reasons don't!'
    </p>
    <p>
      "And then, abruptly, and for the first time, a doubt entered me: a doubt
      of her perfect moral honesty. I don't know how else to describe my feeling
      that she wasn't playing fair, that in coming to my house, in throwing
      herself at my head (I called things by their names), she had perhaps not
      so much obeyed an irresistible impulse as deeply, deliberately reckoned on
      the dissolvent effect of her generosity, her rashness and her beauty....
    </p>
    <p>
      "From the moment that this mean doubt raised its head in me I was once
      more the creature of all the conventional scruples: I was repeating,
      before the looking-glass of my self-consciousness, all the stereotyped
      gestures of the 'man of honour.'... Oh, the sorry figure I must have cut!
      You'll understand my dropping the curtain on it as quickly as I can....
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yet I remember, as I made my point, being struck by its impressiveness. I
      was suffering and enjoying my own suffering. I told her that, whatever
      step we decided to take, I owed it to her to insist on its being taken
      soberly, deliberately&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "('No: it's "advisedly," isn't it? Oh, I was thinking of the Marriage
      Service,' she interposed with a faint laugh.)
    </p>
    <p>
      "&mdash;that if I accepted, there, on the spot, her headlong beautiful
      gift of herself, I should feel I had taken an unfair advantage of her, an
      advantage which she would be justified in reproaching me with afterward;
      that I was not afraid to tell her this because she was intelligent enough
      to know that my scruples were the surest proof of the quality of my love;
      that I refused to owe my happiness to an unconsidered impulse; that we
      must see each other again, in her own house, in less agitating
      circumstances, when she had had time to reflect on my words, to study her
      heart and look into the future....
    </p>
    <p>
      "The factitious exhilaration produced by uttering these beautiful
      sentiments did not last very long, as you may imagine. It fell, little by
      little, under her quiet gaze, a gaze in which there was neither contempt
      nor irony nor wounded pride, but only a tender wistfulness of
      interrogation; and I think the acutest point in my suffering was reached
      when she said, as I ended: 'Oh; yes, of course I understand.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'If only you hadn't come to me here!' I blurted out in the torture of my
      soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She was on the threshold when I said it, and she turned and laid her hand
      gently on mine. 'There was no other way,' she said; and at the moment it
      seemed to me like some hackneyed phrase in a novel that she had used
      without any sense of its meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't remember what I answered or what more we either of us said. At
      the end a desperate longing to take her in my arms and keep her with me
      swept aside everything else, and I went up to her, pleading, stammering,
      urging I don't know what.... But she held me back with a quiet look, and
      went. I had ordered the carriage, as she asked me to; and my last definite
      recollection is of watching her drive off in the rain....
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had her promise that she would see me, two days later, at her house in
      town, and that we should then have what I called 'a decisive talk'; but I
      don't think that even at the moment I was the dupe of my phrase. I knew,
      and she knew, that the end had come...."

      self-discipline seemed to me the only exercise worthy of a reflecting
      mind. I <i>had</i> to justify my great refusal, and I tried to do it by
      plunging myself up to the eyes into the very conditions I had been
      instinctively struggling to get away from. The only possible consolation
      would have been to find in a life of business routine and social
      submission such moral compensations as may reward the citizen if they fail
      the man; but to attain to these I should have had to accept the old
      delusion that the social and the individual man are two. Now, on the
      contrary, I found soon enough that I couldn't get one part of my machinery
      to work effectively while another wanted feeding: and that in rejecting
      what had seemed to me a negation of action I had made all my action
      negative.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The best solution, of course, would have been to fall in love with
      another woman; but it was long before I could bring myself to wish that
      this might happen to me.... Then, at length, I suddenly and violently
      desired it; and as such impulses are seldom without some kind of imperfect
      issue I contrived, a year or two later, to work myself up into the
      wished-for state.... She was a woman in society, and with all the awe of
      that institution that Paulina lacked. Our relation was consequently one of
      those unavowed affairs in which triviality is the only alternative to
      tragedy. Luckily we had, on both sides, risked only as much as prudent
      people stake in a drawingroom game; and when the match was over I take it
      that we came out fairly even.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My gain, at all events, was of an unexpected kind. The adventure had
      served only to make me understand Paulina's abhorrence of such
      experiments, and at every turn of the slight intrigue I had felt how
      exasperating and belittling such a relation was bound to be between two
      people who, had they been free, would have mated openly. And so from a
      brief phase of imperfect forgetting I was driven back to a deeper and more
      understanding remembrance....
    </p>
    <p>
      "This second incarnation of Paulina was one of the strangest episodes of
      the whole strange experience. Things she had said during our extraordinary
      talk, things I had hardly heard at the time, came back to me with singular
      vividness and a fuller meaning. I hadn't any longer the cold consolation
      of believing in my own perspicacity: I saw that her insight had been
      deeper and keener than mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I remember, in particular, starting up in bed one sleepless night as
      there flashed into my head the meaning of her last words: 'There was no
      other way'; the phrase I had half-smiled at at the time, as a parrot-like
      echo of the novel-heroine's stock farewell. I had never, up to that
      moment, wholly understood why Paulina had come to my house that night. I
      had never been able to make that particular act&mdash;which could hardly,
      in the light of her subsequent conduct, be dismissed as a blind surge of
      passion&mdash;square with my conception of her character. She was at once
      the most spontaneous and the steadiest-minded woman I had ever known, and
      the last to wish to owe any advantage to surprise, to unpreparedness, to
      any play on the spring of sex. The better I came, retrospectively, to know
      her, the more sure I was of this, and the less intelligible her act
      appeared. And then, suddenly, after a night of hungry restless thinking,
      the flash of enlightenment came. She had come to my house, had brought her
      trunk with her, had thrown herself at my head with all possible violence
      and publicity, in order to give me a pretext, a loophole, an honourable
      excuse, for doing and saying&mdash;why, precisely what I had said and
      done!
    </p>
    <p>
      "As the idea came to me it was as if some ironic hand had touched an
      electric button, and all my fatuous phrases had leapt out on me in fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course she had known all along just the kind of thing I should say if
      I didn't at once open my arms to her; and to save my pride, my dignity, my
      conception of the figure I was cutting in her eyes, she had recklessly and
      magnificently provided me with the decentest pretext a man could have for
      doing a pusillanimous thing....
    </p>
    <p>
      "With that discovery the whole case took a different aspect. It hurt less
      to think of Paulina&mdash;and yet it hurt more. The tinge of bitterness,
      of doubt, in my thoughts of her had had a tonic quality. It was harder to
      go on persuading myself that I had done right as, bit by bit, my theories
      crumbled under the test of time. Yet, after all, as she herself had said,
      one could judge of results only in the long run....
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Trants stayed away for two years; and about a year after they got
      back, you may remember, Trant was killed in a railway accident. You know
      Fate's way of untying a knot after everybody has given up tugging at it!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well&mdash;there I was, completely justified: all my weaknesses turned
      into merits! I had 'saved' a weak woman from herself, I had kept her to
      the path of duty, I had spared her the humiliation of scandal and the
      misery of self-reproach; and now I had only to put out my hand and take my
      reward.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had avoided Paulina since her return, and she had made no effort to see
      me. But after Trant's death I wrote her a few lines, to which she sent a
      friendly answer; and when a decent interval had elapsed, and I asked if I
      might call on her, she answered at once that she would see me.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I went to her house with the fixed intention of asking her to marry me&mdash;and
      I left it without having done so. Why? I don't know that I can tell you.
      Perhaps you would have had to sit there opposite her, knowing what I did
      and feeling as I did, to understand why. She was kind, she was
      compassionate&mdash;I could see she didn't want to make it hard for me.
      Perhaps she even wanted to make it easy. But there, between us, was the
      memory of the gesture I hadn't made, forever parodying the one I was
      attempting! There wasn't a word I could think of that hadn't an echo in it
      of words of hers I had been deaf to; there wasn't an appeal I could make
      that didn't mock the appeal I had rejected. I sat there and talked of her
      husband's death, of her plans, of my sympathy; and I knew she understood;
      and knowing that, in a way, made it harder.... The door-bell rang and the
      footman came in to ask if she would receive other visitors. She looked at
      me a moment and said 'Yes,' and I got up and shook hands and went away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A few days later she sailed for Europe, and the next time we met she had
      married Reardon...."

      Merrick rose from his chair, pushed back a fallen log and put up the
      fender. He walked across the room and stared a moment at the Brangwyn
      etching before which Paulina Trant had paused at a memorable turn of their
      talk. Then he came back and laid his hand on my shoulder.

      "She summed it all up, you know, when she said that one way of finding out
      whether a risk is worth taking is <i>not</i> to take it, and then to see
      what one becomes in the long run, and draw one's inferences. The long run&mdash;well,
      we've run it, she and I. I know what I've become, but that's nothing to
      the misery of knowing what she's become. She had to have some kind of
      life, and she married Reardon. Reardon's a very good fellow in his way;
      but the worst of it is that it's not her way....
    </p>
    <p>
      "No: the worst of it is that now she and I meet as friends. We dine at the
      same houses, we talk about the same people, we play bridge together, and I
      lend her books. And sometimes Reardon slaps me on the back and says: 'Come
      in and dine with us, old man! What you want is to be cheered up!' And I go
      and dine with them, and he tells me how jolly comfortable she makes him,
      and what an ass I am not to marry; and she presses on me a second helping
      of <i>poulet Maryland</i>, and I smoke one of Reardon's cigars, and at
      half-past ten I get into my overcoat, and walk back alone to my rooms...."

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
