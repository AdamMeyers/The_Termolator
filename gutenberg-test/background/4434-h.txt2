      CHAPTER I. ABOVE BUTTONS
    
    
      Long after the hours when tradesmen are in the habit of commencing
      business, the shutters of a certain shop in the town of Lymport-on-the-Sea
      remained significantly closed, and it became known that death had taken
      Mr. Melchisedec Harrington, and struck one off the list of living tailors.
      The demise of a respectable member of this class does not ordinarily
      create a profound sensation. He dies, and his equals debate who is to be
      his successor: while the rest of them who have come in contact with him,
      very probably hear nothing of his great launch and final adieu till the
      winding up of cash-accounts; on which occasions we may augur that he is
      not often blessed by one or other of the two great parties who subdivide
      this universe. In the case of Mr. Melchisedec it was otherwise. This had
      been a grand man, despite his calling, and in the teeth of opprobrious
      epithets against his craft. To be both generally blamed, and generally
      liked, evinces a peculiar construction of mortal. Mr. Melchisedec, whom
      people in private called the great Mel, had been at once the sad dog of
      Lymport, and the pride of the town. He was a tailor, and he kept horses;
      he was a tailor, and he had gallant adventures; he was a tailor, and he
      shook hands with his customers. Finally, he was a tradesman, and he never
      was known to have sent in a bill. Such a personage comes but once in a
      generation, and, when he goes, men miss the man as well as their money.
    
    
      That he was dead, there could be no doubt. Kilne, the publican opposite,
      had seen Sally, one of the domestic servants, come out of the house in the
      early morning and rush up the street to the doctor's, tossing her hands;
      and she, not disinclined to dilute her grief, had, on her return, related
      that her master was then at his last gasp, and had refused, in so many
      words, to swallow the doctor.
    
    
      '"I won't swallow the doctor!" he says, "I won't swallow the doctor!"'
      Sally moaned. '"I never touched him," he says, "and I never will."'
    
    
      Kilne angrily declared, that in his opinion, a man who rejected medicine
      in extremity, ought to have it forced down his throat: and considering
      that the invalid was pretty deeply in Kilne's debt, it naturally assumed
      the form of a dishonest act on his part; but Sally scornfully dared any
      one to lay hand on her master, even for his own good. 'For,' said she,
      'he's got his eyes awake, though he do lie so helpless. He marks ye!'
    
    
      'Ah! ah!' Kilne sniffed the air. Sally then rushed back to her duties.
    
    
      'Now, there 's a man!' Kilne stuck his hands in his pockets and began his
      meditation: which, however, was cut short by the approach of his neighbour
      Barnes, the butcher, to whom he confided what he had heard, and who
      ejaculated professionally, 'Obstinate as a pig!' As they stood together
      they beheld Sally, a figure of telegraph, at one of the windows, implying
      that all was just over.
    
    
      'Amen!' said Barnes, as to a matter-of-fact affair.
    
    
      Some minutes after, the two were joined by Grossby, the confectioner, who
      listened to the news, and observed:
    
    
      'Just like him! I'd have sworn he'd never take doctor's stuff'; and,
      nodding at Kilne, 'liked his medicine best, eh?'
    
    
      'Had a-hem!       good lot of it,' muttered Kilne, with a suddenly serious
      brow.
    
    
      'How does he stand on your books?' asked Barnes.
    
    
      Kilne shouldered round, crying: 'Who the deuce is to know?'
    
    
      'I don't,' Grossby sighed. 'In he comes with his "Good morning, Grossby,
      fine day for the hunt, Grossby," and a ten-pound note. "Have the kindness
      to put that down in my favour, Grossby." And just as I am going to say,
      "Look here,       this won't do," he has me by the collar, and there's one
      of the regiments going to give a supper party, which he's to order; or the
      Admiral's wife wants the receipt for that pie; or in comes my wife, and
      there's no talking of business then, though she may have been bothering
      about his account all the night beforehand. Something or other! and so we
      run on.'
    
    
      'What I want to know,' said Barnes, the butcher, 'is where he got his
      tenners from?'
    
    
      Kilne shook a sagacious head: 'No knowing!'
    
    
      'I suppose we shall get something out of the fire?' Barnes suggested.
    
    
      'That depends!' answered the emphatic Kilne.
    
    
      'But, you know, if the widow carries on the business,' said Grossby,
      'there's no reason why we shouldn't get it all, eh?'
    
    
      'There ain't two that can make clothes for nothing, and make a profit out
      of it,' said Kilne.
    
    
      'That young chap in Portugal,' added Barnes, 'he won't take to tailoring
      when he comes home. D' ye think he will?'
    
    
      Kilne muttered: 'Can't say!' and Grossby, a kindly creature in his way,
      albeit a creditor, reverting to the first subject of their discourse,
      ejaculated, 'But what a one he was!       eh?'
    
    
      'Fine!       to look on,' Kilne assented.
    
    
      'Well, he was like a Marquis,' said Barnes.
    
    
      Here the three regarded each other, and laughed, though not loudly. They
      instantly checked that unseemliness, and Kilne, as one who rises from the
      depths of a calculation with the sum in his head, spoke quite in a
      different voice:
    
    
      'Well, what do you say, gentlemen? shall we adjourn? No use standing
      here.'
    
    
      By the invitation to adjourn, it was well understood by the committee
      Kilne addressed, that they were invited to pass his threshold, and partake
      of a morning draught. Barnes, the butcher, had no objection whatever, and
      if Grossby, a man of milder make, entertained any, the occasion and common
      interests to be discussed, advised him to waive them. In single file these
      mourners entered the publican's house, where Kilne, after summoning them
      from behind the bar, on the important question, what it should be? and
      receiving, first, perfect acquiescence in his views as to what it should
      be, and then feeble suggestions of the drink best befitting that early
      hour and the speaker's particular constitution, poured out a toothful to
      each, and one to himself.
    
    
      'Here's to him, poor fellow!' said Kilne; and was deliberately echoed
      twice.
    
    
      'Now, it wasn't that,' Kilne pursued, pointing to the bottle in the midst
      of a smacking of lips, 'that wasn't what got him into difficulties. It was
      expensive luckshries. It was being above his condition. Horses! What's a
      tradesman got to do with horses? Unless he's retired! Then he's a
      gentleman, and can do as he likes. It's no use trying to be a gentleman if
      you can't pay for it. It always ends bad. Why, there was he, consorting
      with gentlefolks       gay as a lark! Who has to pay for it?'
    
    
      Kilne's fellow-victims maintained a rather doleful tributary silence.
    
    
      'I'm not saying anything against him now,' the publican further observed.
      'It 's too late. And there! I'm sorry he's gone, for one. He was as kind a
      hearted a man as ever breathed. And there! perhaps it was just as much my
      fault; I couldn't say "No" to him,       dash me, if I could!'
    
    
      Lymport was a prosperous town, and in prosperity the much-despised British
      tradesman is not a harsh, he is really a well-disposed, easy soul, and
      requires but management, manner, occasional instalments       just to
      freshen the account       and a surety that he who debits is on the spot,
      to be a right royal king of credit. Only the account must never drivel.
      'Stare aut crescere' appears to be his feeling on that point, and the
      departed Mr. Melchisedec undoubtedly understood him there; for the running
      on of the account looked deplorable and extraordinary now that Mr.
      Melchisedec was no longer in a position to run on with it, and it was
      precisely his doing so which had prevented it from being brought to a
      summary close long before. Both Barnes, the butcher; and Grossby, the
      confectioner, confessed that they, too, found it hard ever to say 'No' to
      him, and, speaking broadly, never could.
    
    
      'Except once,'said Barnes, 'when he wanted me to let him have a ox to
      roast whole out on the common, for the Battle of Waterloo. I stood out
      against him on that. "No, no," says I, "I'll joint him for ye, Mr.
      Harrington. You shall have him in joints, and eat him at home";-ha! ha!'
    
    
      'Just like him!' said Grossby, with true enjoyment of the princely
      disposition that had dictated the patriotic order.
    
    
      'Oh!       there!' Kilne emphasized, pushing out his arm across the bar,
      as much as to say, that in anything of such a kind, the great Mel never
      had a rival.
    
    
      'That "Marquis" affair changed him a bit,' said Barnes.
    
    
      'Perhaps it did, for a time,' said Kilne. 'What's in the grain, you know.
      He couldn't change. He would be a gentleman, and nothing 'd stop him.'
    
    
      'And I shouldn't wonder but what that young chap out in Portugal 'll want
      to be one, too; though he didn't bid fair to be so fine a man as his
      father.'
    
    
      'More of a scholar,' remarked Kilne. 'That I call his worst fault       shilly-shallying
      about that young chap. I mean his.' Kilne stretched a finger toward the
      dead man's house. 'First, the young chap's to be sent into the Navy; then
      it's the Army; then he's to be a judge, and sit on criminals; then he goes
      out to his sister in Portugal; and now there's nothing but a tailor open
      to him, as I see, if we're to get our money.'
    
    
      'Ah! and he hasn't got too much spirit to work to pay his father's debts,'
      added Barnes. 'There's a business there to make any man's fortune-properly
      directed, I say. But, I suppose, like father like son, he'll becoming the
      Marquis, too. He went to a gentleman's school, and he's had foreign
      training. I don't know what to think about it. His sisters over there       they
      were fine women.'
    
    
      'Oh! a fine family, every one of 'em! and married well!' exclaimed the
      publican.
    
    
      'I never had the exact rights of that "Marquis" affair,' said Grossby;
      and, remembering that he had previously laughed knowingly when it was
      alluded to, pursued: 'Of course I heard of it at the time, but how did he
      behave when he was blown upon?'
    
    
      Barnes undertook to explain; but Kilne, who relished the narrative quite
      as well, and was readier, said: 'Look here! I 'll tell you. I had it from
      his own mouth one night when he wasn't       not quite himself. He was
      coming down King William Street, where he stabled his horse, you know, and
      I met him. He'd been dining out-somewhere out over Fallow field, I think
      it was; and he sings out to me, "Ah! Kilne, my good fellow!" and I,
      wishing to be equal with him, says, "A fine night, my lord!" and he draws
      himself up       he smelt of good company       says he, "Kilne! I'm not a
      lord, as you know, and you have no excuse for mistaking me for one, sir!"
      So I pretended I had mistaken him, and then he tucked his arm under mine,
      and said, "You're no worse than your betters, Kilne. They took me for one
      at Squire Uplift's to-night, but a man who wishes to pass off for more
      than he is, Kilne, and impose upon people, he says, "he's contemptible,
      Kilne! contemptible!" So that, you know, set me thinking about "Bath" and
      the "Marquis," and I couldn't help smiling to myself, and just let slip a
      question whether he had enlightened them a bit. "Kilne," said he, "you're
      an honest man, and a neighbour, and I'll tell you what happened. The
      Squire," he says, "likes my company, and I like his table. Now the Squire
      'd never do a dirty action, but the Squire's nephew, Mr. George Uplift, he
      can't forget that I earn my money, and once or twice I have had to correct
      him." And I'll wager Mel did it, too! Well, he goes on: "There was Admiral
      Sir Jackson Racial and his lady, at dinner, Squire Falco of Bursted, Lady
      Barrington, Admiral Combleman       our admiral, that was; 'Mr. This and
      That', I forget their names       and other ladies and gentlemen whose
      acquaintance I was not honoured with." You know his way of talking. "And
      there was a goose on the table," he says; and, looking stern at me, "Don't
      laugh yet!" says he, like thunder. "Well, he goes on: Mr. George caught my
      eye across the table, and said, so as not to be heard by his uncle, 'If
      that bird was rampant, you would see your own arms, Marquis.'" And Mel
      replied, quietly for him to hear, 'And as that bird is couchant, Mr.
      George, you had better look to your sauce.' Couchant means squatting, you
      know. That's heraldry! Well, that wasn't bad sparring of Mel's. But, bless
      you! he was never taken aback, and the gentlefolks was glad enough to get
      him to sit down amongst 'em. So, says Mr. George, "I know you're a
      fire-eater, Marquis," and his dander was up, for he began marquising Mel,
      and doing the mock polite at such a rate, that, by-and-by, one of the
      ladies who didn't know Mel called him "my lord" and "his lordship." "And,"
      says Mel, "I merely bowed to her, and took no notice." So that passed off:
      and there sits Mel telling his anecdotes, as grand as a king. And, by
      and-by, young Mr. George, who hadn't forgiven Mel, and had been pulling at
      the bottle pretty well, he sings out, "It 's Michaelmas! the death of the
      goose! and I should like to drink the Marquis's health!" and he drank it
      solemn. But, as far as I can make out, the women part of the company was a
      little in the dark. So Mel waited till there was a sort of a pause, and
      then speaks rather loud to the Admiral, "By the way, Sir Jackson, may I
      ask you, has the title of Marquis anything to do with tailoring?" Now Mel
      was a great favourite with the Admiral, and with his lady, too, they say       and
      the Admiral played into his hands, you see, and, says he, "I 'm not aware
      that it has, Mr. Harrington." And he begged for to know why he asked the
      question       called him, "Mister," you understand. So Mel said, and I
      can see him now, right out from his chest he spoke, with his head up "When
      I was a younger man, I had the good taste to be fond of good society, and
      the bad taste to wish to appear different from what I was in it": that's
      Mel speaking; everybody was listening; so he goes on: "I was in the habit
      of going to Bath in the season, and consorting with the gentlemen I met
      there on terms of equality; and for some reason that I am quite guiltless
      of," says Mel, "the hotel people gave out that I was a Marquis in
      disguise; and, upon my honour, ladies and gentlemen       I was young
      then, and a fool       I could not help imagining I looked the thing. At
      all events, I took upon myself to act the part, and with some success, and
      considerable gratification; for, in my opinion," says Mel, "no real
      Marquis ever enjoyed his title so much as I did. One day I was in my shop       No.
      193, Main Street, Lymport       and a gentleman came in to order his
      outfit. I received his directions, when suddenly he started back, stared
      at me, and exclaimed:
    
    
      'My dear Marquis! I trust you will pardon me for having addressed you with
      so much familiarity.' I recognized in him one of my Bath acquaintances.
      That circumstance, ladies and gentlemen, has been a lesson to me. Since
      that time I have never allowed a false impression with regard to my
      position to exist. I desire," says Mel, smiling, "to have my exact measure
      taken everywhere; and if the Michaelmas bird is to be associated with me,
      I am sure I have no objection; all I can say is, that I cannot justify it
      by letters patent of nobility." That's how Mel put it. Do you think they
      thought worse of him? I warrant you he came out of it in flying colours.
      Gentlefolks like straight-forwardness in their inferiors       that's what
      they do. Ah!' said Kilne, meditatively, 'I see him now, walking across the
      street in the moonlight, after he 'd told me that. A fine figure of a man!
      and there ain't many Marquises to match him.'
    
    
      To this Barnes and Grossby, not insensible to the merits of the recital
      they had just given ear to, agreed. And with a common voice of praise in
      the mouths of his creditors, the dead man's requiem was sounded.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER II. THE HERITAGE OF THE SON
    
    
      Toward evening, a carriage drove up to the door of the muted house, and
      the card of Lady Racial, bearing a hurried line in pencil, was handed to
      the widow.
    
    
      It was when you looked upon her that you began to comprehend how great was
      the personal splendour of the husband who could eclipse such a woman. Mrs.
      Harrington was a tall and a stately dame. Dressed in the high waists of
      the matrons of that period, with a light shawl drawn close over her
      shoulders and bosom, she carried her head well; and her pale firm
      features, with the cast of immediate affliction on them, had much dignity:
      dignity of an unrelenting physical order, which need not express any
      remarkable pride of spirit. The family gossips who, on both sides, were
      vain of this rare couple, and would always descant on their beauty, even
      when they had occasion to slander their characters, said, to distinguish
      them, that Henrietta Maria had a Port, and Melchisedec a Presence: and
      that the union of a Port and a Presence, and such a Port and such a
      Presence, was so uncommon, that you might search England through and you
      would not find another, not even in the highest ranks of society. There
      lies some subtle distinction here; due to the minute perceptions which
      compel the gossips of a family to coin phrases that shall express the
      nicest shades of a domestic difference. By a Port, one may understand them
      to indicate something unsympathetically impressive; whereas a Presence
      would seem to be a thing that directs the most affable appeal to our poor
      human weaknesses. His Majesty King George IV., for instance, possessed a
      Port: Beau Brummel wielded a Presence. Many, it is true, take a Presence
      to mean no more than a shirt-frill, and interpret a Port as the art of
      walking erect. But this is to look upon language too narrowly.
    
    
      On a more intimate acquaintance with the couple, you acknowledge the
      aptness of the fine distinction. By birth Mrs. Harrington had claims to
      rank as a gentlewoman. That is, her father was a lawyer of Lymport. The
      lawyer, however, since we must descend the genealogical tree, was known to
      have married his cook, who was the lady's mother. Now Mr. Melchisedec was
      mysterious concerning his origin; and, in his cups, talked largely and
      wisely of a great Welsh family, issuing from a line of princes; and it is
      certain that he knew enough of their history to have instructed them on
      particular points of it. He never could think that his wife had done him
      any honour in espousing him; nor was she the woman to tell him so. She had
      married him for love, rejecting various suitors, Squire Uplift among them,
      in his favour. Subsequently she had committed the profound connubial error
      of transferring her affections, or her thoughts, from him to his business,
      which, indeed, was much in want of a mate; and while he squandered the
      guineas, she patiently picked up the pence. They had not lived unhappily.
      He was constantly courteous to her. But to see the Port at that sordid
      work considerably ruffled the Presence       put, as it were, the peculiar
      division between them; and to behave toward her as the same woman who had
      attracted his youthful ardours was a task for his magnificent mind, and
      may have ranked with him as an indemnity for his general conduct, if his
      reflections ever stretched so far. The townspeople of Lymport were correct
      in saying that his wife, and his wife alone, had, as they termed it, kept
      him together. Nevertheless, now that he was dead, and could no longer be
      kept together, they entirely forgot their respect for her, in the outburst
      of their secret admiration for the popular man. Such is the constitution
      of the inhabitants of this dear Island of Britain, so falsely accused by
      the Great Napoleon of being a nation of shopkeepers. Here let any one
      proclaim himself Above Buttons, and act on the assumption, his fellows
      with one accord hoist him on their heads, and bear him aloft, sweating,
      and groaning, and cursing, but proud of him! And if he can contrive, or
      has any good wife at home to help him, to die without going to the dogs,
      they are, one may say, unanimous in crying out the same eulogistic funeral
      oration as that commenced by Kilne, the publican, when he was interrupted
      by Barnes, the butcher, 'Now, there's a man!       '
    
    
      Mrs. Harrington was sitting in her parlour with one of her married nieces,
      Mrs. Fiske, and on reading Lady Racial's card she gave word for her to be
      shown up into the drawing-room. It was customary among Mrs. Harrington's
      female relatives, who one and all abused and adored the great Mel, to
      attribute his shortcomings pointedly to the ladies; which was as much as
      if their jealous generous hearts had said that he was sinful, but that it
      was not his fault. Mrs. Fiske caught the card from her aunt, read the
      superscription, and exclaimed: 'The idea! At least she might have had the
      decency! She never set her foot in the house before       and right enough
      too! What can she want now? I decidedly would refuse to see her, aunt!'
    
    
      The widow's reply was simply, 'Don't be a fool, Ann!'
    
    
      Rising, she said: 'Here, take poor Jacko, and comfort him till I come
      back.'
    
    
      Jacko was a middle-sized South American monkey, and had been a pet of her
      husband's. He was supposed to be mourning now with the rest of the family.
      Mrs. Fiske received him on a shrinking lap, and had found time to correct
      one of his indiscretions before she could sigh and say, in the rear of her
      aunt's retreating figure, 'I certainly never would let myself, down so';
      but Mrs. Harrington took her own counsel, and Jacko was of her persuasion,
      for he quickly released himself from Mrs. Fiske's dispassionate embrace,
      and was slinging his body up the balusters after his mistress.
    
    
      'Mrs. Harrington,' said Lady Racial, very sweetly swimming to meet her as
      she entered the room, 'I have intruded upon you, I fear, in venturing to
      call upon you at such a time?'
    
    
      The widow bowed to her, and begged her to be seated.
    
    
      Lady Racial was an exquisitely silken dame, in whose face a winning smile
      was cut, and she was still sufficiently youthful not to be accused of
      wearing a flower too artificial.
    
    
      'It was so sudden! so sad!' she continued. 'We esteemed him so much. I
      thought you might be in need of sympathy, and hoped I might       Dear
      Mrs. Harrington! can you bear to speak of it?'
    
    
      'I can tell you anything you wish to hear, my lady,' the widow replied.
      Lady Racial had expected to meet a woman much more like what she conceived
      a tradesman's wife would be: and the grave reception of her proffer of
      sympathy slightly confused her. She said:
    
    
      'I should not have come, at least not so early, but Sir Jackson, my
      husband, thought, and indeed I imagined       You have a son, Mrs.
      Harrington? I think his name is       '
    
    
      'Evan, my lady.'
    
    
      'Evan. It was of him we have been speaking. I imagined that is, we
      thought, Sir Jackson might       you will be writing to him, and will let
      him know we will use our best efforts to assist him in obtaining some
      position worthy of his       superior to       something that will secure
      him from the harassing embarrassments of an uncongenial employment.'
    
    
      The widow listened to this tender allusion to the shears without a smile
      of gratitude. She replied: 'I hope my son will return in time to bury his
      father, and he will thank you himself, my lady.'
    
    
      'He has no taste for       a       for anything in the shape of trade, has
      he, Mrs. Harrington?'
    
    
      'I am afraid not, my lady.'
    
    
      'Any position       a situation       that of a clerk even       would be
      so much better for him!'
    
    
      The widow remained impassive.
    
    
      'And many young gentlemen I know, who are clerks, and are enabled to live
      comfortably, and make a modest appearance in society; and your son, Mrs.
      Harrington, he would find it surely an improvement upon       many would
      think it a step for him.'
    
    
      'I am bound to thank you for the interest you take in my son, my lady.'
    
    
      'Does it not quite suit your views, Mrs. Harrington?' Lady Racial was
      surprised at the widow's manner.
    
    
      'If my son had only to think of himself, my lady.'
    
    
      'Oh! but of course,'       the lady understood her now       'of course!
      You cannot suppose, Mrs. Harrington, but that I should anticipate he would
      have you to live with him, and behave to you in every way as a dutiful
      son, surely?
    
    
      'A clerk's income is not very large, my lady.'
    
    
      'No; but enough, as I have said, and with the management you would bring,
      Mrs. Harrington, to produce a modest, respectable maintenance. My respect
      for your husband, Mrs. Harrington, makes me anxious to press my services
      upon you.' Lady Racial could not avoid feeling hurt at the widow's want of
      common gratitude.
    
    
      'A clerk's income would not be more than L100 a year, my lady.'
    
    
      'To begin with       no; certainly not more.' The lady was growing brief.
    
    
      'If my son puts by the half of that yearly, he can hardly support himself
      and his mother, my lady.'
    
    
      'Half of that yearly, Mrs. Harrington?'
    
    
      'He would have to do so, and be saddled till he dies, my lady.'
    
    
      'I really cannot see why.'
    
    
      Lady Racial had a notion of some excessive niggardly thrift in the widow,
      which was arousing symptoms of disgust.
    
    
      Mrs. Harrington quietly said: 'There are his father's debts to pay, my
      lady.'
    
    
      'His father's debts!'
    
    
      'Under L5000, but above L4000, my lady.'
    
    
      'Five thousand pounds! Mrs. Harrington!' The lady's delicately gloved hand
      gently rose and fell. 'And this poor young man       'she pursued.
    
    
      'My son will have to pay it, my lady.'
    
    
      For a moment the lady had not a word to instance. Presently she remarked:
      'But, Mrs. Harrington, he is surely under no legal obligation?'
    
    
      'He is only under the obligation not to cast disrespect on his father's
      memory, my lady; and to be honest, while he can.'
    
    
      'But, Mrs. Harrington! surely! what can the poor young man do?'
    
    
      'He will pay it, my lady.'
    
    
      'But how, Mrs. Harrington?'
    
    
      'There is his father's business, my lady.'
    
    
      His father's business! Then must the young man become a tradesman in order
      to show respect for his father? Preposterous! That was the lady's natural
      inward exclamation. She said, rather shrewdly, for one who knew nothing of
      such things: 'But a business which produces debts so enormous, Mrs.
      Harrington!'
    
    
      The widow replied: 'My son will have to conduct it in a different way. It
      would be a very good business, conducted properly, my lady.'
    
    
      'But if he has no taste for it, Mrs. Harrington? If he is altogether
      superior to it?'
    
    
      For the first time during the interview, the widow's inflexible
      countenance was mildly moved, though not to any mild expression.
    
    
      'My son will have not to consult his tastes,' she observed: and seeing the
      lady, after a short silence, quit her seat, she rose likewise, and touched
      the fingers of the hand held forth to her, bowing.
    
    
      'You will pardon the interest I take in your son,' said Lady Racial. 'I
      hope, indeed, that his relatives and friends will procure him the means of
      satisfying the demands made upon him.'
    
    
      'He would still have to pay them, my lady,' was the widow's answer.
    
    
      'Poor young man! indeed I pity him!' sighed her visitor. 'You have
      hitherto used no efforts to persuade him to take such a step,       Mrs.
      Harrington?'
    
    
      'I have written to Mr. Goren, who was my husband's fellow-apprentice in
      London, my lady; and he is willing to instruct him in cutting, and
      measuring, and keeping accounts.'
    
    
      Certain words in this speech were obnoxious to the fine ear of Lady
      Racial, and she relinquished the subject.
    
    
      'Your husband, Mrs. Harrington       I should so much have wished!       he
      did not pass away in       in pain!'
    
    
      'He died very calmly, my lady.'
    
    
      'It is so terrible, so disfiguring, sometimes. One dreads to see!       one
      can hardly distinguish! I have known cases where death was dreadful! But a
      peaceful death is very beautiful! There is nothing shocking to the mind.
      It suggests heaven! It seems a fulfilment of our prayers!'
    
    
      'Would your ladyship like to look upon him?' said the widow.
    
    
      Lady Racial betrayed a sudden gleam at having her desire thus intuitively
      fathomed.
    
    
      'For one moment, Mrs. Harrington! We esteemed him so much! May I?'
    
    
      The widow responded by opening the door, and leading her into the chamber
      where the dead man lay.
    
    
      At that period, when threats of invasion had formerly stirred up the
      military fire of us Islanders, the great Mel, as if to show the great
      Napoleon what character of being a British shopkeeper really was, had, by
      remarkable favour, obtained a lieutenancy of militia dragoons: in the
      uniform of which he had revelled, and perhaps, for the only time in his
      life, felt that circumstances had suited him with a perfect fit. However
      that may be, his solemn final commands to his wife, Henrietta Maria, on
      whom he could count for absolute obedience in such matters, had been, that
      as soon as the breath had left his body, he should be taken from his bed,
      washed, perfumed, powdered, and in that uniform dressed and laid out; with
      directions that he should be so buried at the expiration of three days,
      that havoc in his features might be hidden from men. In this array Lady
      Racial beheld him. The curtains of the bed were drawn aside. The beams of
      evening fell soft through the blinds of the room, and cast a subdued light
      on the figure of the vanquished warrior. The Presence, dumb now for
      evermore, was sadly illumined for its last exhibition. But one who looked
      closely might have seen that Time had somewhat spoiled that perfect fit
      which had aforetime been his pride; and now that the lofty spirit had
      departed, there had been extreme difficulty in persuading the sullen
      excess of clay to conform to the dimensions of those garments. The upper
      part of the chest alone would bear its buttons, and across one portion of
      the lower limbs an ancient seam had started; recalling an incident to them
      who had known him in his brief hour of glory. For one night, as he was
      riding home from Fallow field, and just entering the gates of the town, a
      mounted trooper spurred furiously past, and slashing out at him, gashed
      his thigh. Mrs. Melchisedec found him lying at his door in a not unwonted
      way; carried him up-stairs in her arms, as she had done many a time
      before, and did not perceive his condition till she saw the blood on her
      gown. The cowardly assailant was never discovered; but Mel was both
      gallant and had, in his military career, the reputation of being a
      martinet. Hence, divers causes were suspected. The wound failed not to
      mend, the trousers were repaired: Peace about the same time was made, and
      the affair passed over.
    
    
      Looking on the fine head and face, Lady Racial saw nothing of this. She
      had not looked long before she found covert employment for her
      handkerchief. The widow standing beside her did not weep, or reply to her
      whispered excuses at emotion; gazing down on his mortal length with a sort
      of benignant friendliness; aloof, as one whose duties to that form of
      flesh were well-nigh done. At the feet of his master, Jacko, the monkey,
      had jumped up, and was there squatted, with his legs crossed, very like a
      tailor! The imitative wretch had got a towel, and as often as Lady
      Racial's handkerchief travelled to her eyes, Jacko's peery face was
      hidden, and you saw his lithe skinny body doing grief's convulsions till,
      tired of this amusement, he obtained possession of the warrior's helmet,
      from a small round table on one side of the bed; a calque of the barbarous
      military-Georgian form, with a huge knob of horse-hair projecting over the
      peak; and under this, trying to adapt it to his rogue's head, the tricksy
      image of Death extinguished himself.
    
    
      All was very silent in the room. Then the widow quietly disengaged Jacko,
      and taking him up, went to the door, and deposited him outside. During her
      momentary absence, Lady Racial had time to touch the dead man's forehead
      with her lips, unseen.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER III. THE DAUGHTERS OF THE SHEARS
    
    
      Three daughters and a son were left to the world by Mr. Melchisedec. Love,
      well endowed, had already claimed to provide for the daughters: first in
      the shape of a lean Marine subaltern, whose days of obscuration had now
      passed, and who had come to be a major of that corps: secondly, presenting
      his addresses as a brewer of distinction: thirdly, and for a climax, as a
      Portuguese Count: no other than the Senor Silva Diaz, Conde de Saldar: and
      this match did seem a far more resplendent one than that of the two elder
      sisters with Major Strike and Mr. Andrew Cogglesby. But the rays of
      neither fell visibly on Lymport. These escaped Eurydices never reappeared,
      after being once fairly caught away from the gloomy realms of Dis,
      otherwise Trade. All three persons of singular beauty, a certain
      refinement, some Port, and some Presence, hereditarily combined, they
      feared the clutch of that fell king, and performed the widest possible
      circles around him. Not one of them ever approached the house of her
      parents. They were dutiful and loving children, and wrote frequently; but
      of course they had to consider their new position, and their husbands, and
      their husbands' families, and the world, and what it would say, if to it
      the dreaded rumour should penetrate! Lymport gossips, as numerous as in
      other parts, declared that the foreign nobleman would rave in an
      extraordinary manner, and do things after the outlandish fashion of his
      country: for from him, there was no doubt, the shop had been most
      successfully veiled, and he knew not of Pluto's close relationship to his
      lovely spouse.
    
    
      The marriages had happened in this way. Balls are given in country towns,
      where the graces of tradesmen's daughters may be witnessed and admired at
      leisure by other than tradesmen: by occasional country gentlemen of the
      neighbourhood, with light minds: and also by small officers: subalterns
      wishing to do tender execution upon man's fair enemy, and to find a
      distraction for their legs. The classes of our social fabric have, here
      and there, slight connecting links, and provincial public balls are one of
      these. They are dangerous, for Cupid is no respecter of class-prejudice;
      and if you are the son of a retired tea-merchant, or of a village doctor,
      or of a half-pay captain, or of anything superior, and visit one of them,
      you are as likely to receive his shot as any shopboy. Even masquerading
      lords at such places, have been known to be slain outright; and although
      Society allows to its highest and dearest to save the honour of their
      families, and heal their anguish, by indecorous compromise, you, if you
      are a trifle below that mark, must not expect it. You must absolutely give
      yourself for what you hope to get. Dreadful as it sounds to philosophic
      ears, you must marry. This, having danced with Caroline Harrington, the
      gallant Lieutenant Strike determined to do. Nor, when he became aware of
      her father's occupation, did he shrink from his resolve. After a month's
      hard courtship, he married her straight out of her father's house. That he
      may have all the credit due to him, it must be admitted that he did not
      once compare, or possibly permit himself to reflect on, the dissimilarity
      in their respective ranks, and the step he had taken downward, till they
      were man and wife: and then not in any great degree, before Fortune had
      given him his majority; an advance the good soldier frankly told his wife
      he did not owe to her. If we may be permitted to suppose the colonel of a
      regiment on friendly terms with one of his corporals, we have an estimate
      of the domestic life of Major and Mrs. Strike. Among the garrison males,
      his comrades, he passed for a disgustingly jealous brute.
    
    
      The ladies, in their pretty language, signalized him as a 'finick.'
    
    
      Now, having achieved so capital a marriage, Caroline, worthy creature, was
      anxious that her sisters should not be less happy, and would have them to
      visit her, in spite of her husband's protests.
    
    
      'There can be no danger,' she said, for she was in fresh quarters, far
      from the nest of contagion. The lieutenant himself ungrudgingly declared
      that, looking on the ladies, no one for an instant could suspect; and he
      saw many young fellows ready to be as great fools as he had been another
      voluntary confession he made to his wife; for the candour of which she
      thanked him, and pointed out that it seemed to run in the family; inasmuch
      as Mr. Andrew Cogglesby, his rich relative, had seen and had proposed for
      Harriet. The lieutenant flatly said he would never allow it. In fact he
      had hitherto concealed the non-presentable portion of his folly very
      satisfactorily from all save the mess-room, and Mr. Andrew's passion was a
      severe dilemma to him. It need scarcely be told that his wife, fortified
      by the fervid brewer, defeated him utterly. What was more, she induced him
      to be an accomplice in deception. For though the lieutenant protested that
      he washed his hands of it, and that it was a fraud and a snare, he
      certainly did not avow the condition of his wife's parents to Mr. Andrew,
      but alluded to them in passing as 'the country people.' He supposed 'the
      country people' must be asked, he said. The brewer offered to go down to
      them. But the lieutenant drew an unpleasant picture of the country people,
      and his wife became so grave at the proposal, that Mr. Andrew said he
      wanted to marry the lady and not the 'country people,' and if she would
      have him, there he was. There he was, behaving with a particular and
      sagacious kindness to the raw lieutenant since Harriet's arrival. If the
      lieutenant sent her away, Mr. Andrew would infallibly pursue her, and
      light on a discovery. Twice cursed by Love, twice the victim of tailordom,
      our excellent Marine gave away Harriet Harrington in marriage to Mr.
      Andrew Cogglesby.
    
    
      Thus Joy clapped hands a second time, and Horror deepened its shadows.
    
    
      From higher ground it was natural that the remaining sister should take a
      bolder flight. Of the loves of the fair Louisa Harrington and the foreign
      Count, and how she first encountered him in the brewer's saloons, and how
      she, being a humorous person, laughed at his 'loaf' for her, and wore the
      colours that pleased him, and kindled and soothed his jealousy, little is
      known beyond the fact that she espoused the Count, under the auspices of
      the affluent brewer, and engaged that her children should be brought up in
      the faith of the Catholic Church: which Lymport gossips called, paying the
      Devil for her pride.
    
    
      The three sisters, gloriously rescued by their own charms, had now to
      think of their one young brother. How to make him a gentleman! That was
      their problem.
    
    
      Preserve him from tailordom       from all contact with trade       they
      must; otherwise they would be perpetually linked to the horrid thing they
      hoped to outlive and bury. A cousin of Mr. Melchisedec's had risen to be
      an Admiral and a knight for valiant action in the old war, when men could
      rise. Him they besought to take charge of the youth, and make a
      distinguished seaman of him. He courteously declined. They then attacked
      the married Marine       Navy or Army being quite indifferent to them as
      long as they could win for their brother the badge of one Service, 'When
      he is a gentleman at once!' they said, like those who see the end of their
      labours. Strike basely pretended to second them. It would have been
      delightful to him, of course, to have the tailor's son messing at the same
      table, and claiming him when he pleased with a familiar 'Ah, brother!' and
      prating of their relationship everywhere. Strike had been a fool: in
      revenge for it he laid out for himself a masterly career of consequent
      wisdom. The brewer       uxorious Andrew Cogglesby       might and would
      have bought the commission. Strike laughed at the idea of giving money for
      what could be got for nothing. He told them to wait.
    
    
      In the meantime Evan, a lad of seventeen, spent the hours not devoted to
      his positive profession       that of gentleman       in the offices of
      the brewery, toying with big books and balances, which he despised with
      the combined zeal of the sucking soldier and emancipated tailor.
    
    
      Two years passed in attendance on the astute brother-in-law, to whom
      Fortune now beckoned to come to her and gather his laurels from the
      pig-tails. About the same time the Countess sailed over from Lisbon on a
      visit to her sister Harriet (in reality, it was whispered in the Cogglesby
      saloons, on a diplomatic mission from the Court of Lisbon; but that could
      not be made ostensible). The Countess narrowly examined Evan, whose steady
      advance in his profession both her sisters praised.
    
    
      'Yes,' said the Countess, in a languid alien accent. 'He has something of
      his father's carriage       something. Something of his delivery       his
      readiness.'
    
    
      It was a remarkable thing that these ladies thought no man on earth like
      their father, and always cited him as the example of a perfect gentleman,
      and yet they buried him with one mind, and each mounted guard over his
      sepulchre, to secure his ghost from an airing.
    
    
      'He can walk, my dears, certainly, and talk       a little. Tete-a-tete, I
      do not say. I should think there he would be       a stick! All you
      English are. But what sort of a bow has he got, I ask you? How does he
      enter a room? And, then his smile! his laugh! He laughs like a horse       absolutely!
      There's no music in his smile. Oh! you should see a Portuguese nobleman
      smile. O mio Deus! honeyed, my dears! But Evan has it not. None of you
      English have. You go so.'
    
    
      The Countess pressed a thumb and finger to the sides of her mouth, and set
      her sisters laughing.
    
    
      'I assure you, no better! not a bit! I faint in your society. I ask myself       Where
      am I? Among what boors have I fallen? But Evan is no worse than the rest
      of you; I acknowledge that. If he knew how to dress his shoulders
      properly, and to direct his eyes       Oh! the eyes! you should see how a
      Portuguese nobleman can use his eyes! Soul! my dears, soul! Can any of you
      look the unutterable without being absurd! You look so.'
    
    
      And the Countess hung her jaw under heavily vacuous orbits, something as a
      sheep might yawn.
    
    
      'But I acknowledge that Evan is no worse than the rest of you,' she
      repeated. 'If he understood at all the management of his eyes and mouth!
      But that's what he cannot possibly learn in England       not possibly! As
      for your poor husband, Harriet! one really has to remember his excellent
      qualities to forgive him, poor man! And that stiff bandbox of a man of
      yours, Caroline!' addressing the wife of the Marine, 'he looks as if he
      were all angles and sections, and were taken to pieces every night and put
      together in the morning. He may be a good soldier       good anything you
      will       but, Diacho! to be married to that! He is not civilized. None
      of you English are. You have no place in the drawing-room. You are like so
      many intrusive oxen       absolutely! One of your men trod on my toe the
      other night, and what do you think the creature did? Jerks back, then the
      half of him forward       I thought he was going to break in two       then
      grins, and grunts, "Oh! 'm sure, beg pardon, 'm sure!" I don't know
      whether he didn't say, MARM!'
    
    
      The Countess lifted her hands, and fell away in laughing horror. When her
      humour, or her feelings generally, were a little excited, she spoke her
      vernacular as her sisters did, but immediately subsided into the
      deliberate delicately-syllabled drawl.
    
    
      'Now that happened to me once at one of our great Balls,' she pursued. 'I
      had on one side of me the Duchesse Eugenia de Formosa de Fontandigua; on
      the other sat the Countess de Pel, a widow. And we were talking of the
      ices that evening. Eugenia, you must know, my dears, was in love with the
      Count Belmarana. I was her sole confidante. The Countess de Pel       a
      horrible creature! Oh! she was the Duchess's determined enemy-would have
      stabbed her for Belmarana, one of the most beautiful men! Adored by every
      woman! So we talked ices, Eugenic and myself, quite comfortably, and that
      horrible De Pel had no idea in life! Eugenia had just said, "This ice
      sickens me! I do not taste the flavour of the vanille." I answered, "It is
      here! It must       it cannot but be here! You love the flavour of the
      vanille?" With her exquisite smile, I see her now saying, "Too well! it is
      necessary to me! I live on it!"       when up he came. In his eagerness,
      his foot just effleured my robe. Oh! I never shall forget! In an instant
      he was down on one knee it was so momentary that none saw it but we three,
      and done with ineffable grace. "Pardon!" he said, in his sweet Portuguese;
      "Pardon!" looking up       the handsomest man I ever beheld; and when I
      think of that odious wretch the other night, with his "Oh! 'm sure, beg
      pardon, 'm sure! 'pon my honour!" I could have kicked him       I could,
      indeed!'
    
    
      Here the Countess laughed out, but relapsed into:
    
    
      'Alas! that Belmarana should have betrayed that beautiful trusting
      creature to De Pel. Such scandal! a duel!       the Duke was wounded. For
      a whole year Eugenia did not dare to appear at Court, but had to remain
      immured in her country-house, where she heard that Belmarana had married
      De Pel! It was for her money, of course. Rich as Croesus, and as wicked as
      the black man below! as dear papa used to say. By the way, weren't we
      talking of Evan? Ah,       yes!'
    
    
      And so forth. The Countess was immensely admired, and though her sisters
      said that she was 'foreignized' overmuch, they clung to her desperately.
      She seemed so entirely to have eclipsed tailordom, or 'Demogorgon,' as the
      Countess was pleased to call it. Who could suppose this grand-mannered
      lady, with her coroneted anecdotes and delicious breeding, the daughter of
      that thing? It was not possible to suppose it. It seemed to defy the fact
      itself.
    
    
      They congratulated her on her complete escape from Demogorgon. The
      Countess smiled on them with a lovely sorrow.
    
    
      'Safe from the whisper, my dears; the ceaseless dread? If you knew what I
      have to endure! I sometimes envy you. 'Pon my honour, I sometimes wish I
      had married a fishmonger! Silva, indeed, is a most excellent husband.
      Polished! such polish as you know not of in England. He has a way       a
      wriggle with his shoulders in company       I cannot describe it to you;
      so slight! so elegant! and he is all that a woman could desire. But who
      could be safe in any part of the earth, my dears, while papa will go about
      so, and behave so extraordinarily? I was at dinner at your English embassy
      a month ago, and there was Admiral Combleman, then on the station off
      Lisbon, Sir Jackson Racial's friend, who was the Admiral at Lymport
      formerly. I knew him at once, and thought, oh! what shall I do! My heart
      was like a lump of lead. I would have given worlds that we might one of us
      have smothered the other! I had to sit beside him       it always happens!
      Thank heaven! he did not identify me. And then he told an anecdote of
      Papa. It was the dreadful old "Bath" story. I thought I should have died.
      I could not but fancy the Admiral suspected. Was it not natural? And what
      do you think I had the audacity to do? I asked him coolly, whether the Mr.
      Harrington he mentioned was not the son of Sir Abraham Harrington, of
      Torquay,       the gentleman who lost his yacht in the Lisbon waters last
      year? I brought it on myself. 'Gentleman, ma'am,       MA'AM!' says the
      horrid old creature, laughing, 'gentleman! he's a                I cannot
      speak it: I choke!' And then he began praising Papa. Diacho! what I
      suffered. But, you know, I can keep my countenance, if I perish. I am a
      Harrington as much as any of us!'
    
    
      And the Countess looked superb in the pride with which she said she was
      what she would have given her hand not to be. But few feelings are single
      on this globe, and junction of sentiments need not imply unity in our
      yeasty compositions.
    
    
      'After it was over       my supplice,' continued the Countess, 'I was
      questioned by all the ladies       I mean our ladies       not your
      English. They wanted to know how I could be so civil to that intolerable
      man. I gained a deal of credit, my dears. I laid it all on       Diplomacy.'
      The Countess laughed bitterly. 'Diplomacy bears the burden of it all. I
      pretended that Combleman could be useful to Silva! Oh! what hypocrites we
      all are, mio Deus!'
    
    
      The ladies listening could not gainsay this favourite claim of universal
      brotherhood among the select who wear masks instead of faces.
    
    
      With regard to Evan, the Countess had far outstripped her sisters in her
      views. A gentleman she had discovered must have one of two things       a
      title or money. He might have all the breeding in the world; he might be
      as good as an angel; but without a title or money he was under eclipse
      almost total. On a gentleman the sun must shine. Now, Evan had no title,
      no money. The clouds were thick above the youth. To gain a title he would
      have to scale aged mountains. There was one break in his firmament through
      which the radiant luminary might be assisted to cast its beams on him
      still young. That divine portal was matrimony. If he could but make a rich
      marriage he would blaze transfigured; all would be well! And why should
      not Evan marry an heiress, as well as another?
    
    
      'I know a young creature who would exactly suit him,' said the Countess.
      'She is related to the embassy, and is in Lisbon now. A charming child       just
      sixteen! Dios! how the men rave about her! and she isn't a beauty,       there's
      the wonder; and she is a little too gauche too English in her habits and
      ways of thinking; likes to be admired, of course, but doesn't know yet how
      to set about getting it. She rather scandalizes our ladies, but when you
      know her!       She will have, they say, a hundred 'thousand pounds in her
      own right! Rose Jocelyn, the daughter of Sir Franks, and that eccentric
      Lady Jocelyn. She is with her uncle, Melville, the celebrated diplomate
      though, to tell you the truth, we turn him round our fingers, and spin him
      as the boys used to do the cockchafers. I cannot forget our old Fallow
      field school-life, you see, my dears. Well, Rose Jocelyn would just suit
      Evan. She is just of an age to receive an impression. And I would take
      care she did. Instance me a case where I have failed?
    
    
      'Or there is the Portuguese widow, the Rostral. She's thirty, certainly;
      but she possesses millions! Estates all over the kingdom, and the sweetest
      creature. But, no. Evan would be out of the way there, certainly. But       our
      women are very nice: they have the dearest, sweetest ways: but I would
      rather Evan did not marry one of them. And then there 's the religion!'
    
    
      This was a sore of the Countess's own, and she dropped a tear in coming
      across it.
    
    
      'No, my dears, it shall be Rose Jocelyn!' she concluded: 'I will take Evan
      over with me, and see that he has opportunities. It shall be Rose, and
      then I can call her mine; for in verity I love the child.'
    
    
      It is not my part to dispute the Countess's love for Miss Jocelyn; and I
      have only to add that Evan, unaware of the soft training he was to
      undergo, and the brilliant chance in store for him, offered no impediment
      to the proposition that he should journey to Portugal with his sister
      (whose subtlest flattery was to tell him that she should not be ashamed to
      own him there); and ultimately, furnished with cash for the trip by the
      remonstrating brewer, went.
    
    
      So these Parcae, daughters of the shears, arranged and settled the young
      man's fate. His task was to learn the management of his mouth, how to
      dress his shoulders properly, and to direct his eyes       rare qualities
      in man or woman, I assure you; the management of the mouth being
      especially admirable, and correspondingly difficult. These achieved, he
      was to place his battery in position, and win the heart and hand of an
      heiress.
    
    
      Our comedy opens with his return from Portugal, in company with Miss Rose,
      the heiress; the Honourable Melville Jocelyn, the diplomate; and the Count
      and Countess de Saldar, refugees out of that explosive little kingdom.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER IV. ON BOARD THE JOCASTA
    
    
      From the Tagus to the Thames the Government sloop-of-war, Jocasta, had
      made a prosperous voyage, bearing that precious freight, a removed
      diplomatist and his family; for whose uses let a sufficient vindication be
      found in the exercise he affords our crews in the science of seamanship.
      She entered our noble river somewhat early on a fine July morning. Early
      as it was, two young people, who had nothing to do with the trimming or
      guiding of the vessel, stood on deck, and watched the double-shore,
      beginning to embrace them more and more closely as they sailed onward.
      One, a young lady, very young in manner, wore a black felt hat with a
      floating scarlet feather, and was clad about the shoulders in a mantle of
      foreign style and pattern. The other you might have taken for a wandering
      Don, were such an object ever known; so simply he assumed the dusky
      sombrero and dangling cloak, of which one fold was flung across his breast
      and drooped behind him. The line of an adolescent dark moustache ran along
      his lip, and only at intervals could you see that his eyes were blue and
      of the land he was nearing. For the youth was meditative, and held his
      head much down. The young lady, on the contrary, permitted an open
      inspection of her countenance, and seemed, for the moment at least, to be
      neither caring nor thinking of what kind of judgement would be passed on
      her. Her pretty nose was up, sniffing the still salt breeze with vivacious
      delight.
    
    
      'Oh!' she cried, clapping her hands, 'there goes a dear old English gull!
      How I have wished to see him! I haven't seen one for two years and seven
      months. When I 'm at home, I 'll leave my window open all night, just to
      hear the rooks, when they wake in the morning. There goes another!'
    
    
      She tossed up her nose again, exclaiming:
    
    
      'I 'm sure I smell England nearer and nearer! I smell the fields, and the
      cows in them. I'd have given anything to be a dairy-maid for half an hour!
      I used to lie and pant in that stifling air among those stupid people, and
      wonder why anybody ever left England. Aren't you glad to come back?'
    
    
      This time the fair speaker lent her eyes to the question, and shut her
      lips; sweet, cold, chaste lips she had: a mouth that had not yet dreamed
      of kisses, and most honest eyes.
    
    
      The young man felt that they were not to be satisfied by his own, and
      after seeking to fill them with a doleful look, which was immediately
      succeeded by one of superhuman indifference, he answered:
    
    
      'Yes! We shall soon have to part!' and commenced tapping with his foot the
      cheerful martyr's march.
    
    
      Speech that has to be hauled from the depths usually betrays the effort.
      Listening an instant to catch the import of this cavernous gasp upon the
      brink of sound, the girl said:
    
    
      'Part? what do you mean?'
    
    
      Apparently it required a yet vaster effort to pronounce an explanation.
      The doleful look, the superhuman indifference, were repeated in due order:
      sound, a little more distinct, uttered the words:
    
    
      'We cannot be as we have been, in England!' and then the cheerful martyr
      took a few steps farther.
    
    
      'Why, you don't mean to say you're going to give me up, and not be friends
      with me, because we've come back to England?' cried the girl in a rapid
      breath, eyeing him seriously.
    
    
      Most conscientiously he did not mean it! but he replied with the quietest
      negative.
    
    
      'No?' she mimicked him. 'Why do you say "No" like that? Why are you so
      mysterious, Evan? Won't you promise me to come and stop with us for weeks?
      Haven't you said we would ride, and hunt, and fish together, and read
      books, and do all sorts of things?'
    
    
      He replied with the quietest affirmative.
    
    
      'Yes? What does "Yes!" mean?' She lifted her chest to shake out the
      dead-alive monosyllable, as he had done. 'Why are you so singular this
      morning, Evan? Have I offended you? You are so touchy!'
    
    
      The slur on his reputation for sensitiveness induced the young man to
      attempt being more explicit.
    
    
      'I mean,' he said, hesitating; 'why, we must part. We shall not see each
      other every day. Nothing more than that.' And away went the cheerful
      martyr in sublimest mood.
    
    
      'Oh! and that makes you, sorry?' A shade of archness was in her voice.
    
    
      The girl waited as if to collect something in her mind, and was now a
      patronizing woman.
    
    
      'Why, you dear sentimental boy! You don't suppose we could see each other
      every day for ever?'
    
    
      It was perhaps the cruelest question that could have been addressed to the
      sentimental boy from her mouth. But he was a cheerful martyr!
    
    
      'You dear Don Doloroso!' she resumed. 'I declare if you are not just like
      those young Portugals this morning; and over there you were such a dear
      English fellow; and that's why I liked you so much! Do change! Do, please,
      be lively, and yourself again. Or mind; I'll call you Don Doloroso, and
      that shall be your name in England. See there!       that's       that's?
      what's the name of that place? Hoy! Mr. Skerne!' She hailed the boatswain,
      passing, 'Do tell me the name of that place.'
    
    
      Mr. Skerne righted about to satisfy her minutely, and then coming up to
      Evan, he touched his hat, and said:
    
    
      'I mayn't have another opportunity       we shall be busy up there       of
      thankin' you again, sir, for what you did for my poor drunken brother
      Bill, and you may take my word I won't forget it, sir, if he does; and I
      suppose he'll be drowning his memory just as he was near drowning
      himself.'
    
    
      Evan muttered something, grimaced civilly, and turned away. The girl's
      observant brows were moved to a faintly critical frown, and nodding
      intelligently to the boatswain's remark, that the young gentleman did not
      seem quite himself, now that he was nearing home, she went up to Evan, and
      said:
    
    
      'I'm going to give you a lesson in manners, to be quits with you. Listen,
      sir. Why did you turn away so ungraciously from Mr. Skerne, while he was
      thanking you for having saved his brother's life? Now there's where you're
      too English. Can't you bear to be thanked?'
    
    
      'I don't want to be thanked because I can swim,' said Evan.
    
    
      'But it is not that. Oh, how you trifle!' she cried. 'There's nothing
      vexes me so much as that way you have. Wouldn't my eyes have sparkled if
      anybody had come up to me to thank me for such a thing? I would let them
      know how glad I was to have done such a thing! Doesn't it make them
      happier, dear Evan?'
    
    
      'My dear Miss Jocelyn!'
    
    
      'What?'
    
    
      The honest grey eyes fixed on him, narrowed their enlarged lids. She gazed
      before her on the deck, saying:
    
    
      'I'm sure I can't understand you. I suppose it's because I'm a girl, and I
      never shall till I'm a woman. Heigho!'
    
    
      A youth who is engaged in the occupation of eating his heart, cannot shine
      to advantage, and is as much a burden to himself as he is an enigma to
      others. Evan felt this; but he could do nothing and say nothing; so he
      retired deeper into the folds of the Don, and remained picturesque and
      scarcely pleasant.
    
    
      They were relieved by a summons to breakfast from below.
    
    
      She brightened and laughed. 'Now, what will you wager me, Evan, that the
      Countess doesn't begin:
    
    
      "Sweet child! how does she this morning? blooming?" when she kisses me?'
    
    
      Her capital imitation of his sister's manner constrained him to join in
      her laugh, and he said:
    
    
      'I'll back against that, I get three fingers from your uncle, and "Morrow,
      young sir!"'
    
    
      Down they ran together, laughing; and, sure enough, the identical words of
      the respective greetings were employed, which they had to enjoy with all
      the discretion they could muster.
    
    
      Rose went round the table to her little cousin Alec, aged seven, kissed
      his reluctant cheek, and sat beside him, announcing a sea appetite and
      great capabilities, while Evan silently broke bread. The Count de Saldar,
      a diminutive tawny man, just a head and neck above the tablecloth, sat
      sipping chocolate and fingering dry toast, which he would now and then dip
      in jelly, and suck with placidity, in the intervals of a curt exchange of
      French with the wife of the Hon. Melville, a ringleted English lady, or of
      Portuguese with the Countess; who likewise sipped chocolate and fingered
      dry toast, and was mournfully melodious. The Hon. Melville, as became a
      tall islander, carved beef, and ate of it, like a ruler of men. Beautiful
      to see was the compassionate sympathy of the Countess's face when Rose
      offered her plate for a portion of the world-subjugating viand, as who
      should say: 'Sweet child! thou knowest not yet of sorrows, thou canst
      ballast thy stomach with beef!' In any other than an heiress, she would
      probably have thought: 'This is indeed a disgusting little animal, and
      most unfeminine conduct!'
    
    
      Rose, unconscious of praise or blame, rivalled her uncle in enjoyment of
      the fare, and talked of her delight in seeing England again, and anything
      that belonged to her native land. Mrs. Melville perceived that it pained
      the refugee Countess, and gave her the glance intelligible; but the
      Countess never missed glances, or failed to interpret them. She said:
    
    
      'Let her. I love to hear the sweet child's prattle.'
    
    
      'It was fortunate' (she addressed the diplomatist) 'that we touched at
      Southampton and procured fresh provision!'
    
    
      'Very lucky for US!' said he, glaring shrewdly between a mouthful.
    
    
      The Count heard the word 'Southampton,' and wished to know how it was
      comprised. A passage of Portuguese ensued, and then the Countess said:
    
    
      'Silva, you know, desired to relinquish the vessel at Southampton. He does
      not comprehend the word "expense," but' (she shook a dumb Alas!) 'I must
      think of that for him now!'
    
    
      'Oh! always avoid expense,' said the Hon. Melville, accustomed to be paid
      for by his country.
    
    
      'At what time shall we arrive, may I ask, do you think?' the Countess
      gently inquired.
    
    
      The watch of a man who had his eye on Time was pulled out, and she was
      told it might be two hours before dark. Another reckoning, keenly
      balanced, informed the company that the day's papers could be expected on
      board somewhere about three o'clock in the afternoon.
    
    
      'And then,' said the Hon. Melville, nodding general gratulation, 'we shall
      know how the world wags.'
    
    
      How it had been wagging the Countess's straining eyes under closed eyelids
      were eloquent of.
    
    
      'Too late, I fear me, to wait upon Lord Livelyston to-night?' she
      suggested.
    
    
      'To-night?' The Hon. Melville gazed blank astonishment at the notion. 'Oh!
      certainly, too late tonight. A-hum! I think, madam, you had better not be
      in too great a hurry to see him. Repose a little. Recover your fatigue.'
    
    
      'Oh!' exclaimed the Countess, with a beam of utter confidence in him, 'I
      shall be too happy to place myself in your hands       believe me.'
    
    
      This was scarcely more to the taste of the diplomatist. He put up his
      mouth, and said, blandly:
    
    
      'I fear       you know, madam, I must warn you beforehand       I,
      personally, am but an insignificant unit over here, you know; I,
      personally, can't guarantee much assistance to you       not positive.
      What I can do       of course, very happy!' And he fell to again upon the
      beef.
    
    
      'Not so very insignificant!' said the Countess, smiling, as at a softly
      radiant conception of him.
    
    
      'Have to bob and bow like the rest of them over here,' he added, proof
      against the flattery.
    
    
      'But that you will not forsake Silva, I am convinced,' said the Countess;
      and, paying little heed to his brief 'Oh! what I can do,' continued: 'For
      over here, in England, we are almost friendless. My relations       such
      as are left of them       are not in high place.' She turned to Mrs.
      Melville, and renewed the confession with a proud humility. 'Truly, I have
      not a distant cousin in the Cabinet!'
    
    
      Mrs. Melville met her sad smile, and returned it, as one who understood
      its entire import.
    
    
      'My brother-in-law-my sister, I think, you know       married a       a
      brewer! He is rich; but, well! such was her taste! My brother-in-law is
      indeed in Parliament, and he       '
    
    
      'Very little use, seeing he votes with the opposite party,' the
      diplomatist interrupted her.
    
    
      'Ah! but he will not,' said the Countess, serenely. 'I can trust with
      confidence that, if it is for Silva's interest, he will assuredly so
      dispose of his influence as to suit the desiderations of his family, and
      not in any way oppose his opinions to the powers that would willingly
      stoop to serve us!'
    
    
      It was impossible for the Hon. Melville to withhold a slight grimace at
      his beef, when he heard this extremely alienized idea of the nature of a
      member of the Parliament of Great Britain. He allowed her to enjoy her
      delusion, as she pursued:
    
    
      'No. So much we could offer in repayment. It is little! But this, in
      verity, is a case. Silva's wrongs have only to be known in England, and I
      am most assured that the English people will not permit it. In the days of
      his prosperity, Silva was a friend to England, and England should not       should
      not       forget it now. Had we money! But of that arm our enemies have
      deprived us: and, I fear, without it we cannot hope to have the justice of
      our cause pleaded in the English papers. Mr. Redner, you know, the
      correspondent in Lisbon, is a sworn foe to Silva. And why but because I
      would not procure him an invitation to Court! The man was so horridly
      vulgar; his gloves were never clean; I had to hold a bouquet to my nose
      when I talked to him. That, you say, was my fault! Truly so. But what
      woman can be civil to a low-bred, pretentious, offensive man?'
    
    
      Mrs. Melville, again appealed to, smiled perfect sympathy, and said, to
      account for his character:
    
    
      'Yes. He is the son of a small shopkeeper of some kind, in Southampton, I
      hear.'
    
    
      'A very good fellow in his way,' said her husband.
    
    
      'Oh! I can't bear that class of people,' Rose exclaimed. 'I always keep
      out of their way. You can always tell them.'
    
    
      The Countess smiled considerate approbation of her exclusiveness and
      discernment. So sweet a smile!
    
    
      'You were on deck early, my dear?' she asked Evan, rather abruptly.
    
    
      Master Alec answered for him: 'Yes, he was, and so was Rose. They made an
      appointment, just as they used to do under the oranges.'
    
    
      'Children!' the Countess smiled to Mrs. Melville.
    
    
      'They always whisper when I'm by,' Alec appended.
    
    
      'Children!' the Countess's sweetened visage entreated Mrs. Melville to
      re-echo; but that lady thought it best for the moment to direct Rose to
      look to her packing, now that she had done breakfast.
    
    
      'And I will take a walk with my brother on deck,' said the Countess.
      'Silva is too harassed for converse.'
    
    
      The parties were thus divided. The silent Count was left to meditate on
      his wrongs in the saloon; and the diplomatist, alone with his lady,
      thought fit to say to her, shortly: 'Perhaps it would be as well to draw
      away from these people a little. We 've done as much as we could for them,
      in bringing them over here. They may be trying to compromise us. That
      woman's absurd. She 's ashamed of the brewer, and yet she wants to sell
      him       or wants us to buy him. Ha! I think she wants us to send a
      couple of frigates, and threaten bombardment of the capital, if they don't
      take her husband back, and receive him with honours.'
    
    
      'Perhaps it would be as well,' said Mrs. Melville. 'Rose's invitation to
      him goes for nothing.'
    
    
      'Rose? inviting the Count? down to Hampshire?' The diplomatist's brows
      were lifted.
    
    
      'No, I mean the other,' said the diplomatist's wife.
    
    
      'Oh! the young fellow! very good young fellow. Gentlemanly. No harm in
      him.'
    
    
      'Perhaps not,' said the diplomatist's wife.
    
    
      'You don't suppose he expects us to keep him on, or provide for him over
      here       eh?'
    
    
      The diplomatist's wife informed him that such was not her thought, that he
      did not understand, and that it did not matter; and as soon as the Hon.
      Melville saw that she was brooding something essentially feminine, and
      which had no relationship to the great game of public life, curiosity was
      extinguished in him.
    
    
      On deck the Countess paced with Evan, and was for a time pleasantly
      diverted by the admiration she could, without looking, perceive that her
      sorrow-subdued graces had aroused in the breast of a susceptible naval
      lieutenant. At last she spoke:
    
    
      'My dear! remember this. Your last word to Mr. Jocelyn will be: "I will do
      myself the honour to call upon my benefactor early." To Rose you will say:
      "Be assured, Miss Jocelyn 'Miss Jocelyn       ' I shall not fail in
      hastening to pay my respects to your family in Hampshire." You will
      remember to do it, in the exact form I speak it.'
    
    
      Evan laughed: 'What! call him benefactor to his face? I couldn't do it.'
    
    
      'Ah! my child!'
    
    
      'Besides, he isn't a benefactor at all. His private secretary died, and I
      stepped in to fill the post, because nobody else was handy.'
    
    
      'And tell me of her who pushed you forward, Evan?'
    
    
      'My dear sister, I'm sure I'm not ungrateful.'
    
    
      'No; but headstrong: opinionated. Now these people will endeavour       Oh!
      I have seen it in a thousand little things       they wish to shake us
      off. Now, if you will but do as I indicate! Put your faith in an older
      head, Evan. It is your only chance of society in England. For your
      brother-in-law       I ask you, what sort of people will you meet at the
      Cogglesbys? Now and then a nobleman, very much out of his element. In
      short, you have fed upon a diet which will make you to distinguish, and
      painfully to know the difference! Indeed! Yes, you are looking about for
      Rose. It depends upon your behaviour now, whether you are to see her at
      all in England. Do you forget? You wished once to inform her of your
      origin. Think of her words at the breakfast this morning!'
    
    
      The Countess imagined she had produced an impression. Evan said: 'Yes, and
      I should have liked to have told her this morning that I'm myself nothing
      more than the son of a       '
    
    
      'Stop! cried his sister, glancing about in horror. The admiring lieutenant
      met her eye. Blandishingly she smiled on him: 'Most beautiful weather for
      a welcome to dear England?' and passed with majesty.
    
    
      'Boy!' she resumed, 'are you mad?'
    
    
      'I hate being such a hypocrite, madam.'
    
    
      'Then you do not love her, Evan?'
    
    
      This may have been dubious logic, but it resulted from a clear sequence of
      ideas in the lady's head. Evan did not contest it.
    
    
      'And assuredly you will lose her, Evan. Think of my troubles! I have to
      intrigue for Silva; I look to your future; I smile, Oh heaven! how do I
      not smile when things are spoken that pierce my heart! This morning at the
      breakfast!'
    
    
      Evan took her hand, and patted it.
    
    
      'What is your pity?' she sighed.
    
    
      'If it had not been for you, my dear sister, I should never have held my
      tongue.'
    
    
      'You are not a Harrington! You are a Dawley!' she exclaimed, indignantly.
    
    
      Evan received the accusation of possessing more of his mother's spirit
      than his father's in silence.
    
    
      'You would not have held your tongue,' she said, with fervid severity:
      'and you would have betrayed yourself! and you would have said you were
      that! and you in that costume! Why, goodness gracious! could you bear to
      appear so ridiculous?'
    
    
      The poor young man involuntarily surveyed his person. The pains of an
      impostor seized him. The deplorable image of the Don making confession
      became present to his mind. It was a clever stroke of this female
      intriguer. She saw him redden grievously, and blink his eyes; and not
      wishing to probe him so that he would feel intolerable disgust at his
      imprisonment in the Don, she continued:
    
    
      'But you have the sense to see your duties, Evan. You have an excellent
      sense, in the main. No one would dream       to see you. You did not, I
      must say, you did not make enough of your gallantry. A Portuguese who had
      saved a man's life, Evan, would he have been so boorish? You behaved as if
      it was a matter of course that you should go overboard after anybody, in
      your clothes, on a dark night. So, then, the Jocelyns took it. I barely
      heard one compliment to you. And Rose       what an effect it should have
      had on her! But, owing to your manner, I do believe the girl thinks it
      nothing but your ordinary business to go overboard after anybody, in your
      clothes, on a dark night. 'Pon my honour, I believe she expects to see you
      always dripping!' The Countess uttered a burst of hysterical humour. 'So
      you miss your credit. That inebriated sailor should really have been gold
      to you. Be not so young and thoughtless.'
    
    
      The Countess then proceeded to tell him how foolishly he had let slip his
      great opportunity. A Portuguese would have fixed the young lady long
      before. By tender moonlight, in captivating language, beneath the
      umbrageous orange-groves, a Portuguese would have accurately calculated
      the effect of the perfume of the blossom on her sensitive nostrils, and
      know the exact moment when to kneel, and declare his passion sonorously.
    
    
      'Yes,' said Evan, 'one of them did. She told me.'
    
    
      'She told you? And you       what did you do?'
    
    
      'Laughed at him with her, to be sure.'
    
    
      'Laughed at him! She told you, and you helped her to laugh at love! Have
      you no perceptions? Why did she tell you?'
    
    
      'Because she thought him such a fool, I suppose.'
    
    
      'You never will know a woman,' said the Countess, with contempt.
    
    
      Much of his worldly sister at a time was more than Evan could bear.
      Accustomed to the symptoms of restiveness, she finished her discourse,
      enjoyed a quiet parade up and down under the gaze of the lieutenant, and
      could find leisure to note whether she at all struck the inferior seamen,
      even while her mind was absorbed by the multiform troubles and anxieties
      for which she took such innocent indemnification.
    
    
      The appearance of the Hon. Melville Jocelyn on deck, and without his wife,
      recalled her to business. It is a peculiarity of female diplomatists that
      they fear none save their own sex. Men they regard as their natural prey:
      in women they see rival hunters using their own weapons. The Countess
      smiled a slowly-kindling smile up to him, set her brother adrift, and
      delicately linked herself to Evan's benefactor.
    
    
      'I have been thinking,' she said, 'knowing your kind and most considerate
      attentions, that we may compromise you in England.'
    
    
      He at once assured her he hoped not, he thought not at all.
    
    
      'The idea is due to my brother,' she went on; 'for I       women know so
      little!       and most guiltlessly should we have done so. My brother
      perhaps does not think of us foremost; but his argument I can distinguish.
      I can see, that were you openly to plead Silva's cause, you might bring
      yourself into odium, Mr. Jocelyn; and heaven knows I would not that! May I
      then ask, that in England we may be simply upon the same footing of
      private friendship?'
    
    
      The diplomatist looked into her uplifted visage, that had all the sugary
      sparkles of a crystallized preserved fruit of the Portugal clime, and
      observed, confidentially, that, with every willingness in the world to
      serve her, he did think it would possibly be better, for a time, to be
      upon that footing, apart from political considerations.
    
    
      'I was very sure my brother would apprehend your views,' said the
      Countess. 'He, poor boy! his career is closed. He must sink into a
      different sphere. He will greatly miss the intercourse with you and your
      sweet family.'
    
    
      Further relieved, the diplomatist delivered a high opinion of the young
      gentleman, his abilities, and his conduct, and trusted he should see him
      frequently.
    
    
      By an apparent sacrifice, the lady thus obtained what she wanted.
    
    
      Near the hour speculated on by the diplomatist, the papers came on board,
      and he, unaware how he had been manoeuvred for lack of a wife at his
      elbow, was quickly engaged in appeasing the great British hunger for news;
      second only to that for beef, it seems, and equally acceptable salted when
      it cannot be had fresh.
    
    
      Leaving the devotee of statecraft with his legs crossed, and his face
      wearing the cognizant air of one whose head is above the waters of events,
      to enjoy the mighty meal of fresh and salted at discretion, the Countess
      dived below.
    
    
      Meantime the Jocasta, as smoothly as before she was ignorant of how the
      world wagged, slipped up the river with the tide; and the sun hung red
      behind the forest of masts, burnishing a broad length of the serpentine
      haven of the nations of the earth. A young Englishman returning home can
      hardly look on this scene without some pride of kinship. Evan stood at the
      fore part of the vessel. Rose, in quiet English attire, had escaped from
      her aunt to join him, singing in his ears, to spur his senses: 'Isn't it
      beautiful? Isn't it beautiful? Dear old England!'
    
    
      'What do you find so beautiful?' he asked.
    
    
      'Oh, you dull fellow! Why the ships, and the houses, and the smoke, to be
      sure.'
    
    
      'The ships? Why, I thought you despised trade, mademoiselle?'
    
    
      'And so I do. That is, not trade, but tradesmen. Of course, I mean
      shopkeepers.'
    
    
      'It's they who send the ships to and fro, and make the picture that
      pleases you, nevertheless.'
    
    
      'Do they?' said she, indifferently, and then with a sort of fervour, 'Why
      do you always grow so cold to me whenever we get on this subject?'
    
    
      'I cold?' Evan responded. The incessant fears of his diplomatic sister had
      succeeded in making him painfully jealous of this subject. He turned it
      off. 'Why, our feelings are just the same. Do you know what I was thinking
      when you came up? I was thinking that I hoped I might never disgrace the
      name of an Englishman.'
    
    
      'Now, that's noble!' cried the girl. 'And I'm sure you never will. Of an
      English gentleman, Evan. I like that better.'
    
    
      'Would your rather be called a true English lady than a true English
      woman, Rose?'
    
    
      'Don't think I would, my dear,' she answered, pertly; 'but "gentleman"
      always means more than "man" to me.'
    
    
      'And what's a gentleman, mademoiselle?'
    
    
      'Can't tell you, Don Doloroso. Something you are, sir,' she added,
      surveying him.
    
    
      Evan sucked the bitter and the sweet of her explanation. His sister in her
      anxiety to put him on his guard, had not beguiled him to forget his real
      state.
    
    
      His sister, the diplomatist and his lady, the refugee Count, with ladies'
      maids, servants, and luggage, were now on the main-deck, and Master Alec,
      who was as good as a newspaper correspondent for private conversations,
      put an end to the colloquy of the young people. They were all assembled in
      a circle when the vessel came to her moorings. The diplomatist glutted
      with news, and thirsting for confirmations; the Count dumb, courteous, and
      quick-eyed; the honourable lady complacent in the consciousness of boxes
      well packed; the Countess breathing mellifluous long-drawn adieux that
      should provoke invitations. Evan and Rose regarded each other.
    
    
      The boat to convey them on shore was being lowered, and they were
      preparing to move forward. Just then the vessel was boarded by a stranger.
    
    
      'Is that one of the creatures of your Customs? I did imagine we were safe
      from them,' exclaimed the Countess.
    
    
      The diplomatist laughingly requested her to save herself anxiety on that
      score, while under his wing. But she had drawn attention to the intruder,
      who was seen addressing one of the midshipmen. He was a man in a long
      brown coat and loose white neckcloth, spectacles on nose, which he wore
      considerably below the bridge and peered over, as if their main use were
      to sight his eye; a beaver hat, with broadish brim, on his head. A man of
      no station, it was evident to the ladies at once, and they would have
      taken no further notice of him had he not been seen stepping toward them
      in the rear of the young midshipman.
    
    
      The latter came to Evan, and said: 'A fellow of the name of Goren wants
      you. Says there's something the matter at home.'
    
    
      Evan advanced, and bowed stiffly.
    
    
      Mr. Goren held out his hand. 'You don't remember me, young man? I cut out
      your first suit for you when you were breeched, though! Yes-ah! Your poor
      father wouldn't put his hand to it. Goren!'
    
    
      Embarrassed, and not quite alive to the chapter of facts this name should
      have opened to him, Evan bowed again.
    
    
      'Goren!' continued the possessor of the name. He had a cracked voice, that
      when he spoke a word of two syllables, commenced with a lugubrious crow,
      and ended in what one might have taken for a curious question.
    
    
      'It is a bad business brings me, young man. I 'm not the best messenger
      for such tidings. It's a black suit, young man! It's your father!'
    
    
      The diplomatist and his lady gradually edged back but Rose remained beside
      the Countess, who breathed quick, and seemed to have lost her
      self-command.
    
    
      Thinking he was apprehended, Mr. Goren said: 'I 'm going down to-night to
      take care of the shop. He 's to be buried in his old uniform. You had
      better come with me by the night-coach, if you would see the last of him,
      young man.'
    
    
      Breaking an odd pause that had fallen, the Countess cried aloud, suddenly:
    
    
      'In his uniform!'
    
    
      Mr. Goren felt his arm seized and his legs hurrying him some paces into
      isolation. 'Thanks! thanks!' was murmured in his ear. 'Not a word more.
      Evan cannot bear it. Oh! you are good to have come, and we are grateful.
      My father! my father!'
    
    
      She had to tighten her hand and wrist against her bosom to keep herself
      up. She had to reckon in a glance how much Rose had heard, or divined. She
      had to mark whether the Count had understood a syllable. She had to
      whisper to Evan to hasten away with the horrible man.
    
    
      She had to enliven his stunned senses, and calm her own. And with mournful
      images of her father in her brain, the female Spartan had to turn to Rose,
      and speculate on the girl's reflective brows, while she said, as over a
      distant relative, sadly, but without distraction: 'A death in the family!'
      and preserved herself from weeping her heart out, that none might guess
      the thing who did not positively know it. Evan touched the hand of Rose
      without meeting her eyes. He was soon cast off in Mr. Goren's boat. Then
      the Countess murmured final adieux; twilight under her lids, but yet a
      smile, stately, affectionate, almost genial. Rose, her sweet Rose, she
      must kiss. She could have slapped Rose for appearing so reserved and cold.
      She hugged Rose, as to hug oblivion of the last few minutes into her. The
      girl leant her cheek, and bore the embrace, looking on her with a kind of
      wonder.
    
    
      Only when alone with the Count, in the brewer's carriage awaiting her on
      shore, did the lady give a natural course to her grief; well knowing that
      her Silva would attribute it to the darkness of their common exile. She
      wept: but in the excess of her misery, two words of strangely opposite
      signification, pronounced by Mr. Goren; two words that were at once poison
      and antidote, sang in her brain; two words that painted her dead father
      from head to foot, his nature and his fortune: these were the Shop, and
      the Uniform.
    
    
      Oh! what would she not have given to have-seen and bestowed on her beloved
      father one last kiss! Oh! how she hoped that her inspired echo of Uniform,
      on board the Jocasta, had drowned the memory, eclipsed the meaning, of
      that fatal utterance of Shop!
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER V. THE FAMILY AND THE FUNERAL
    
    
      It was the evening of the second day since the arrival of the black letter
      in London from Lymport, and the wife of the brewer and the wife of the
      Major sat dropping tears into one another's laps, in expectation of their
      sister the Countess. Mr. Andrew Cogglesby had not yet returned from his
      office. The gallant Major had gone forth to dine with General Sir George
      Frebuter, the head of the Marines of his time. It would have been
      difficult for the Major, he informed his wife, to send in an excuse to the
      General for non-attendance, without entering into particulars; and that he
      should tell the General he could not dine with him, because of the sudden
      decease of a tailor, was, as he let his wife understand, and requested her
      to perceive, quite out of the question. So he dressed himself carefully,
      and though peremptory with his wife concerning his linen, and requiring
      natural services from her in the button department, and a casual
      expression of contentment as to his ultimate make-up, he left her that day
      without any final injunctions to occupy her mind, and she was at liberty
      to weep if she pleased, a privilege she did not enjoy undisturbed when he
      was present; for the warrior hated that weakness, and did not care to hide
      his contempt for it.
    
    
      Of the three sisters, the wife of the Major was, oddly enough, the one who
      was least inveterately solicitous of concealing the fact of her parentage.
      Reticence, of course, she had to study with the rest; the Major was a
      walking book of reticence and the observances; he professed, also, in
      company with herself alone, to have had much trouble in drilling her to
      mark and properly preserve them. She had no desire to speak of her
      birthplace. But, for some reason or other, she did not share her hero's
      rather petulant anxiety to keep the curtain nailed down on that part of
      her life which preceded her entry into the ranks of the Royal Marines.
      Some might have thought that those fair large blue eyes of hers wandered
      now and then in pleasant unambitious walks behind the curtain, and toyed
      with little flowers of palest memory. Utterly tasteless, totally wanting
      in discernment, not to say gratitude, the Major could not presume her to
      be; and yet his wits perceived that her answers and the conduct she shaped
      in accordance with his repeated protests and long-reaching apprehensions
      of what he called danger, betrayed acquiescent obedience more than the
      connubial sympathy due to him. Danger on the field the Major knew not of;
      he did not scruple to name the word in relation to his wife. For, as he
      told her, should he, some day, as in the chapter of accidents might occur,
      sally into the street a Knight Companion of the Bath and become known to
      men as Sir Maxwell Strike, it would be decidedly disagreeable for him to
      be blown upon by a wind from Lymport. Moreover she was the mother of a
      son. The Major pointed out to her the duty she owed her offspring.
      Certainly the protecting aegis of his rank and title would be over the
      lad, but she might depend upon it any indiscretion of hers would damage
      him in his future career, the Major assured her. Young Maxwell must be
      considered.
    
    
      For all this, the mother and wife, when the black letter found them in the
      morning at breakfast, had burst into a fit of grief, and faltered that she
      wept for a father. Mrs. Andrew, to whom the letter was addressed, had
      simply held the letter to her in a trembling hand. The Major compared
      their behaviour, with marked encomiums of Mrs. Andrew. Now this lady and
      her husband were in obverse relative positions. The brewer had no will but
      his Harriet's. His esteem for her combined the constitutional feelings of
      an insignificantly-built little man for a majestic woman, and those of a
      worthy soul for the wife of his bosom. Possessing, or possessed by her,
      the good brewer was perfectly happy. She, it might be thought, under these
      circumstances, would not have minded much his hearing what he might hear.
      It happened, however, that she was as jealous of the winds of Lymport as
      the Major himself; as vigilant in debarring them from access to the
      brewery as now the Countess could have been. We are not dissecting human
      nature suffice it, therefore, from a mere glance at the surface, to say,
      that just as moneyed men are careful of their coin, women who have all the
      advantages in a conjunction, are miserly in keeping them, and shudder to
      think that one thing remains hidden, which the world they move in might
      put down pityingly in favour of their spouse, even though to the little
      man 'twere naught. She assumed that a revelation would diminish her moral
      stature; and certainly it would not increase that of her husband. So no
      good could come of it. Besides, Andrew knew, his whole conduct was a tacit
      admission, that she had condescended in giving him her hand. The features
      of their union might not be changed altogether by a revelation, but it
      would be a shock to her.
    
    
      Consequently, Harriet tenderly rebuked Caroline, for her outcry at the
      breakfast-table; and Caroline, the elder sister, who had not since
      marriage grown in so free an air, excused herself humbly, and the two were
      weeping when the Countess joined them and related what she had just
      undergone.
    
    
      Hearing of Caroline's misdemeanour, however, Louisa's eyes rolled aloft in
      a paroxysm of tribulation. It was nothing to Caroline; it was
      comparatively nothing to Harriet; but the Count knew not Louisa had a
      father: believed that her parents had long ago been wiped out. And the
      Count was by nature inquisitive: and if he once cherished a suspicion he
      was restless; he was pointed in his inquiries: he was pertinacious in
      following out a clue: there never would be peace with him! And then, as
      they were secure in their privacy, Louisa cried aloud for her father, her
      beloved father! Harriet wept silently. Caroline alone expressed regret
      that she had not set eyes on him from the day she became a wife.
    
    
      'How could we, dear?' the Countess pathetically asked, under drowning
      lids.
    
    
      'Papa did not wish it,' sobbed Mrs. Andrew.
    
    
      'I never shall forgive myself!' said the wife of the Major, drying her
      cheeks. Perhaps it was not herself whom she felt she never could forgive.
    
    
      Ah! the man their father was! Incomparable Melchisedec! he might well be
      called. So generous! so lordly! When the rain of tears would subside for a
      moment, one would relate an anecdote or childish reminiscence of him, and
      provoke a more violent outburst.
    
    
      'Never, among the nobles of any land, never have I seen one like him!'
      exclaimed the Countess, and immediately requested Harriet to tell her how
      it would be possible to stop Andrew's tongue in Silva's presence.
    
    
      'At present, you know, my dear, they may talk as much as they like       they
      can't understand one another one bit.'
    
    
      Mrs. Cogglesby comforted her by the assurance that Andrew had received an
      intimation of her wish for silence everywhere and toward everybody; and
      that he might be reckoned upon to respect it, without demanding a reason
      for the restriction. In other days Caroline and Louisa had a little looked
      down on Harriet's alliance with a dumpy man       a brewer       and had
      always kind Christian compassion for him if his name were mentioned. They
      seemed now, by their silence, to have a happier estimate of Andrew's
      qualities.
    
    
      While the three sisters sat mingling their sorrows and alarms, their young
      brother was making his way to the house. As he knocked at the door he
      heard his name pronounced behind him, and had no difficulty in recognizing
      the worthy brewer.
    
    
      'What, Van, my boy! how are you? Quite a foreigner! By George, what a
      hat!'
    
    
      Mr. Andrew bounced back two or three steps to regard the dusky sombrero.
    
    
      'How do you do, sir?' said Evan.
    
    
      'Sir to you!' Mr. Andrew briskly replied. 'Don't they teach you to give
      your fist in Portugal, eh? I'll "sir" you. Wait till I'm Sir Andrew, and
      then "sir" away. You do speak English still, Van, eh? Quite jolly, my
      boy?'
    
    
      Mr. Andrew rubbed his hands to express that state in himself. Suddenly he
      stopped, blinked queerly at Evan, grew pensive, and said, 'Bless my soul!
      I forgot.'
    
    
      The door opened, Mr. Andrew took Evan's arm, murmured a 'hush!' and trod
      gently along the passage to his library.
    
    
      'We're safe here,' he said. 'There       there's something the matter
      up-stairs. The women are upset about something. Harriet       ' Mr. Andrew
      hesitated, and branched off: 'You 've heard we 've got a new baby?'
    
    
      Evan congratulated him; but another inquiry was in Mr. Andrew's aspect,
      and Evan's calm, sad manner answered it.
    
    
      'Yes,'       Mr. Andrew shook his head dolefully       'a splendid little
      chap! a rare little chap! a we can't help these things, Van! They will
      happen. Sit down, my boy.'
    
    
      Mr. Andrew again interrogated Evan with his eyes.
    
    
      'My father is dead,' said Evan.
    
    
      'Yes!' Mr. Andrew nodded, and glanced quickly at the ceiling, as if to
      make sure that none listened overhead. 'My parliamentary duties will soon
      be over for the season,' he added, aloud; pursuing, in an under-breath:
    
    
      'Going down to-night, Van?'
    
    
      'He is to be buried to-morrow,' said Evan.
    
    
      'Then, of course, you go. Yes: quite right. Love your father and mother!
      always love your father and mother! Old Tom and I never knew ours. Tom's
      quite well-same as ever. I'll,' he rang the bell, 'have my chop in here
      with you. You must try and eat a bit, Van. Here we are, and there we go.
      Old Tom's wandering for one of his weeks. You'll see him some day. He
      ain't like me. No dinner to-day, I suppose, Charles?'
    
    
      This was addressed to the footman. He announced:
    
    
      'Dinner to-day at half-past six, as usual, sir,' bowed, and retired.
    
    
      Mr. Andrew pored on the floor, and rubbed his hair back on his head. 'An
      odd world!' was his remark.
    
    
      Evan lifted up his face to sigh: 'I 'm almost sick of it!'
    
    
      'Damn appearances!' cried Mr. Andrew, jumping on his legs.
    
    
      The action cooled him.
    
    
      'I 'm sorry I swore,' he said. 'Bad habit! The Major's here       you know
      that?' and he assumed the Major's voice, and strutted in imitation of the
      stalwart marine. 'Major       a       Strike! of the Royal Marines!
      returned from China! covered with glory!       a hero, Van! We can't
      expect him to be much of a mourner. And we shan't have him to dine with us
      to-day       that's something.' He sank his voice: 'I hope the widow 'll
      bear it.'
    
    
      'I hope to God my mother is well!' Evan groaned.
    
    
      'That'll do,' said Mr. Andrew. 'Don't say any more.'
    
    
      As he spoke, he clapped Evan kindly on the back.
    
    
      A message was brought from the ladies, requiring Evan to wait on them. He
      returned after some minutes.
    
    
      'How do you think Harriet's looking?' asked Mr. Andrew. And, not waiting
      for an answer, whispered,
    
    
      'Are they going down to the funeral, my boy?'
    
    
      Evan's brow was dark, as he replied: 'They are not decided.'
    
    
      'Won't Harriet go?'
    
    
      'She is not going       she thinks not.'
    
    
      'And the Countess       Louisa's upstairs, eh?       will she go?'
    
    
      'She cannot leave the Count       she thinks not.'
    
    
      'Won't Caroline go? Caroline can go. She       he       I mean       Caroline
      can go?'
    
    
      'The Major objects. She wishes to.'
    
    
      Mr. Andrew struck out his arm, and uttered, 'the Major!'       a
      compromise for a loud anathema. But the compromise was vain, for he sinned
      again in an explosion against appearances.
    
    
      'I'm a brewer, Van. Do you think I'm ashamed of it? Not while I brew good
      beer, my boy!       not while I brew good beer! They don't think worse of
      me in the House for it. It isn't ungentlemanly to brew good beer, Van. But
      what's the use of talking?'
    
    
      Mr. Andrew sat down, and murmured, 'Poor girl! poor girl!'
    
    
      The allusion was to his wife; for presently he said: 'I can't see why
      Harriet can't go. What's to prevent her?'
    
    
      Evan gazed at him steadily. Death's levelling influence was in Evan's
      mind. He was ready to say why, and fully.
    
    
      Mr. Andrew arrested him with a sharp 'Never mind! Harriet does as she
      likes. I'm accustomed to       hem! what she does is best, after all. She
      doesn't interfere with my business, nor I with hers. Man and wife.'
    
    
      Pausing a moment or so, Mr. Andrew intimated that they had better be
      dressing for dinner. With his hand on the door, which he kept closed, he
      said, in a businesslike way, 'You know, Van, as for me, I should be very
      willing       only too happy       to go down and pay all the respect I
      could.' He became confused, and shot his head from side to side, looking
      anywhere but at Evan. 'Happy now and to-morrow, to do anything in my
      power, if Harriet       follow the funeral       one of the family       anything
      I could do: but       a       we 'd better be dressing for dinner.' And
      out the enigmatic little man went.
    
    
      Evan partly divined him then. But at dinner his behaviour was perplexing.
      He was too cheerful. He pledged the Count. He would have the Portuguese
      for this and that, and make Anglican efforts to repeat it, and laugh at
      his failures. He would not see that there was a father dead. At a table of
      actors, Mr. Andrew overdid his part, and was the worst. His wife could not
      help thinking him a heartless little man.
    
    
      The poor show had its term. The ladies fled to the boudoir sacred to
      grief. Evan was whispered that he was to join them when he might, without
      seeming mysterious to the Count. Before he reached them, they had talked
      tearfully over the clothes he should wear at Lymport, agreeing that his
      present foreign apparel, being black, would be suitable, and would serve
      almost as disguise, to the inhabitants at large; and as Evan had no
      English wear, and there was no time to procure any for him, that was well.
      They arranged exactly how long he should stay at Lymport, whom he should
      visit, the manner he should adopt toward the different inhabitants. By all
      means he was to avoid the approach of the gentry. For hours Evan, in a
      trance, half stupefied, had to listen to the Countess's directions how he
      was to comport himself in Lymport.
    
    
      'Show that you have descended among them, dear Van, but are not of them.
      Our beautiful noble English poet expresses it so. You have come to pay the
      last mortal duties, which they will respect, if they are not brutes, and
      attempt no familiarities. Allow none: gently, but firmly. Imitate Silva.
      You remember, at Dona Risbonda's ball? When he met the Comte de Dartigues,
      and knew he was to be in disgrace with his Court on the morrow? Oh! the
      exquisite shade of difference in Silva's behaviour towards the Comte. So
      finely, delicately perceptible to the Comte, and not a soul saw it but
      that wretched Frenchman! He came to me: "Madame," he said, "is a question
      permitted?" I replied, "As-many as you please, M. le Comte, but no answers
      promised." He said: "May I ask if the Courier has yet come in?"       "Nay,
      M. le Comte," I replied, "this is diplomacy. Inquire of me, or better,
      give me an opinion on the new glace silk from Paris."       "Madame," said
      he, bowing, "I hope Paris may send me aught so good, or that I shall grace
      half so well." I smiled, "You shall not be single in your hopes, M. le
      Comte. The gift would be base that you did not embellish." He lifted his
      hands, French-fashion: "Madame, it is that I have received the gift."       "Indeed!
      M. le Comte."       "Even now from the Count de Saldar, your husband." I
      looked most innocently, "From my husband, M. le Comte?"       "From him,
      Madame. A portrait. An Ambassador without his coat! The portrait was a
      finished performance." I said: "And may one beg the permission to inspect
      it?"       "Mais," said he, laughing: "were it you alone, it would be a
      privilege to me." I had to check him. "Believe me, M. le Comte, that when
      I look upon it, my praise of the artist will be extinguished by my pity
      for the subject." He should have stopped there; but you cannot have the
      last word with a Frenchman       not even a woman. Fortunately the Queen
      just then made her entry into the saloon, and his mot on the charity of
      our sex was lost. We bowed mutually, and were separated.' (The Countess
      employed her handkerchief.) 'Yes, dear Van! that is how you should behave.
      Imply things. With dearest Mama, of course, you are the dutiful son. Alas!
      you must stand for son and daughters. Mama has so much sense! She will
      understand how sadly we are placed. But in a week I will come to her for a
      day, and bring you back.'
    
    
      So much his sister Louisa. His sister Harriet offered him her house for a
      home in London, thence to project his new career. His sister Caroline
      sought a word with him in private, but only to weep bitterly in his arms,
      and utter a faint moan of regret at marriages in general. He loved this
      beautiful creature the best of his three sisters (partly, it may be,
      because he despised her superior officer), and tried with a few smothered
      words to induce her to accompany him: but she only shook her fair locks
      and moaned afresh. Mr. Andrew, in the farewell squeeze of the hand at the
      street-door, asked him if he wanted anything. He negatived the requirement
      of anything whatever, with an air of careless decision, though he was
      aware that his purse barely contained more than would take him the
      distance, but the instincts of this amateur gentleman were very fine and
      sensitive on questions of money. His family had never known him beg for a
      shilling, or admit his necessity for a penny: nor could he be made to
      accept money unless it was thrust into his pocket. Somehow his sisters had
      forgotten this peculiarity of his. Harriet only remembered it when too
      late.
    
    
      'But I dare say Andrew has supplied him,' she said.
    
    
      Andrew being interrogated, informed her what had passed between them.
    
    
      'And you think a Harrington would confess he wanted money!' was her
      scornful exclamation. 'Evan would walk       he would die rather. It was
      treating him like a mendicant.'
    
    
      Andrew had to shrink in his brewer's skin.
    
    
      By some fatality all who were doomed to sit and listen to the Countess de
      Saldar, were sure to be behindhand in an appointment.
    
    
      When the young man arrived at the coach-office, he was politely informed
      that the vehicle, in which a seat had been secured for him, was in close
      alliance with time and tide, and being under the same rigid laws, could
      not possibly have waited for him, albeit it had stretched a point to the
      extent of a pair of minutes, at the urgent solicitation of a passenger.
    
    
      'A gentleman who speaks so, sir,' said a volunteer mimic of the office,
      crowing and questioning from his throat in Goren's manner. 'Yok! yok! That
      was how he spoke, sir.'
    
    
      Evan reddened, for it brought the scene on board the Jocasta vividly to
      his mind. The heavier business obliterated it. He took counsel with the
      clerks of the office, and eventually the volunteer mimic conducted him to
      certain livery stables, where Evan, like one accustomed to command,
      ordered a chariot to pursue the coach, received a touch of the hat for a
      lordly fee, and was soon rolling out of London.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER VI. MY GENTLEMAN ON THE ROAD
    
    
      The postillion had every reason to believe that he carried a real
      gentleman behind him; in other words, a purse long and liberal. He judged
      by all the points he knew of: a firm voice, a brief commanding style, an
      apparent indifference to expense, and the inexplicable minor
      characteristics, such as polished boots, and a striking wristband, and so
      forth, which will show a creature accustomed to step over the heads of
      men. He had, therefore, no particular anxiety to part company, and jogged
      easily on the white highway, beneath a moon that walked high and small
      over marble clouds.
    
    
      Evan reclined in the chariot, revolving his sensations. In another mood he
      would have called, them thoughts, perhaps, and marvelled at their
      immensity. The theme was Love and Death. One might have supposed, from his
      occasional mutterings at the pace regulated by the postillion, that he was
      burning with anxiety to catch the flying coach. He had forgotten it:
      forgotten that he was giving chase to anything. A pair of wondering
      feminine eyes pursued him, and made him fret for the miles to throw a
      thicker veil between him and them. The serious level brows of Rose haunted
      the poor youth; and reflecting whither he was tending, and to what sight,
      he had shadowy touches of the holiness there is in death, from which came
      a conflict between the imaged phantoms of his father and of Rose, and he
      sided against his love with some bitterness. His sisters, weeping for
      their father and holding aloof from his ashes, Evan swept from his mind.
      He called up the man his father was: the kindliness, the readiness, the
      gallant gaiety of the great Mel. Youths are fascinated by the barbarian
      virtues; and to Evan, under present influences, his father was a pattern
      of manhood. He asked himself: Was it infamous to earn one's bread? and
      answered it very strongly in his father's favour. The great Mel's
      creditors were not by to show him another feature of the case.
    
    
      Hitherto, in passive obedience to the indoctrination of the Countess, Evan
      had looked on tailors as the proscribed race of modern society. He had
      pitied his father as a man superior to his fate; but despite the fitfully
      honest promptings with Rose (tempting to him because of the wondrous
      chivalry they argued, and at bottom false probably as the hypocrisy they
      affected to combat), he had been by no means sorry that the world saw not
      the spot on himself. Other sensations beset him now. Since such a man was
      banned by the world, which was to be despised?
    
    
      The clear result of Evan's solitary musing was to cast a sort of halo over
      Tailordom. Death stood over the pale dead man, his father, and dared the
      world to sneer at him. By a singular caprice of fancy, Evan had no sooner
      grasped this image, than it was suggested that he might as well inspect
      his purse, and see how much money he was master of.
    
    
      Are you impatient with this young man? He has little character for the
      moment. Most youths are like Pope's women; they have no character at all.
      And indeed a character that does not wait for circumstances to shape it,
      is of small worth in the race that must be run. To be set too early, is to
      take the work out of the hands of the Sculptor who fashions men. Happily a
      youth is always at school, and if he was shut up and without mark two or
      three hours ago, he will have something to show you now: as I have seen
      blooming seaflowers and other graduated organisms, when left undisturbed
      to their own action. Where the Fates have designed that he shall present
      his figure in a story, this is sure to happen.
    
    
      To the postillion Evan was indebted for one of his first lessons.
    
    
      About an hour after midnight pastoral stillness and the moon begat in the
      postillion desire for a pipe. Daylight prohibits the dream of it to
      mounted postillions. At night the question is more human, and allows
      appeal. The moon smiles assentingly, and smokers know that she really
      lends herself to the enjoyment of tobacco.
    
    
      The postillion could remember gentlemen who did not object: who had even
      given him cigars. Turning round to see if haply the present inmate of the
      chariot might be smoking, he observed a head extended from the window.
    
    
      'How far are we?' was inquired.
    
    
      The postillion numbered the milestones passed.
    
    
      'Do you see anything of the coach?'
    
    
      'Can't say as I do, sir.'
    
    
      He was commanded to stop. Evan jumped out.
    
    
      'I don't think I'll take you any farther,' he said.
    
    
      The postillion laughed to scorn the notion of his caring how far he went.
      With a pipe in his mouth, he insinuatingly remarked, he could jog on all
      night, and throw sleep to the dogs. Fresh horses at Hillford; fresh at
      Fallow field: and the gentleman himself would reach Lymport fresh in the
      morning.
    
    
      'No, no; I won't take you any farther,' Evan repeated.
    
    
      'But what do it matter, sir?' urged the postillion.
    
    
      'I'd rather go on as I am. I       a       made no arrangement to take you
      the whole way.'
    
    
      'Oh!' cried the postillion, 'don't you go troublin' yourself about that,
      sir. Master knows it 's touch-and-go about catchin' the coach. I'm all
      right.'
    
    
      So infatuated was the fellow in the belief that he was dealing with a
      perfect gentleman       an easy pocket!
    
    
      Now you would not suppose that one who presumes he has sufficient, would
      find a difficulty in asking how much he has to pay. With an effort,
      indifferently masked, Evan blurted:
    
    
      'By the way, tell me       how much       what is the charge for the
      distance we've come?'
    
    
      There are gentlemen-screws: there are conscientious gentlemen. They
      calculate, and remonstrating or not, they pay. The postillion would rather
      have had to do with the gentleman royal, who is above base computation;
      but he knew the humanity in the class he served, and with his conception
      of Evan only partially dimmed, he remarked:
    
    
      'Oh-h-h! that won't hurt you, sir. Jump along in,       settle that
      by-and-by.'
    
    
      But when my gentleman stood fast, and renewed the demand to know the exact
      charge for the distance already traversed, the postillion dismounted,
      glanced him over, and speculated with his fingers tipping up his hat.
      Meantime Evan drew out his purse, a long one, certainly, but limp. Out of
      this drowned-looking wretch the last spark of life was taken by the sum
      the postillion ventured to name; and if paying your utmost farthing
      without examination of the charge, and cheerfully stepping out to walk
      fifty miles, penniless, constituted a postillion's gentleman, Evan would
      have passed the test. The sight of poverty, however, provokes familiar
      feelings in poor men, if you have not had occasion to show them you
      possess particular qualities. The postillion's eye was more on the purse
      than on the sum it surrendered.
    
    
      'There,' said Evan, 'I shall walk. Good night.' And he flung his cloak to
      step forward.
    
    
      'Stop a bit, sir!' arrested him.
    
    
      The postillion rallied up sideways, with an assumption of genial respect.
      'I didn't calc'late myself in that there amount.'
    
    
      Were these words, think you, of a character to strike a young man hard on
      the breast, send the blood to his head, and set up in his heart a derisive
      chorus? My gentleman could pay his money, and keep his footing gallantly;
      but to be asked for a penny beyond what he possessed; to be seen beggared,
      and to be claimed a debtor-aleck! Pride was the one developed faculty of
      Evan's nature. The Fates who mould us, always work from the main-spring. I
      will not say that the postillion stripped off the mask for him, at that
      instant completely; but he gave him the first true glimpse of his
      condition. From the vague sense of being an impostor, Evan awoke to the
      clear fact that he was likewise a fool.
    
    
      It was impossible for him to deny the man's claim, and he would not have
      done it, if he could. Acceding tacitly, he squeezed the ends of his purse
      in his pocket, and with a 'Let me see,' tried his waistcoat. Not too
      impetuously; for he was careful of betraying the horrid emptiness till he
      was certain that the powers who wait on gentlemen had utterly forsaken
      him. They had not. He discovered a small coin, under ordinary
      circumstances not contemptible; but he did not stay to reflect, and was
      guilty of the error of offering it to the postillion.
    
    
      The latter peered at it in the centre of his palm; gazed queerly in the
      gentleman's face, and then lifting the spit of silver for the disdain of
      his mistress, the moon, he drew a long breath of regret at the original
      mistake he had committed, and said:
    
    
      'That's what you're goin' to give me for my night's work?'
    
    
      The powers who wait on gentlemen had only helped the pretending youth to
      try him. A rejection of the demand would have been infinitely wiser and
      better than this paltry compromise. The postillion would have fought it:
      he would not have despised his fare.
    
    
      How much it cost the poor pretender to reply, 'It 's the last farthing I
      have, my man,' the postillion could not know.
    
    
      'A scabby sixpence?' The postillion continued his question.
    
    
      'You heard what I said,' Evan remarked.
    
    
      The postillion drew another deep breath, and holding out the coin at arm's
      length:
    
    
      'Well, sir!' he observed, as one whom mental conflict has brought to the
      philosophy of the case, 'now, was we to change places, I couldn't a' done
      it! I couldn't a' done it!' he reiterated, pausing emphatically.
    
    
      'Take it, sir!' he magnanimously resumed; 'take it! You rides when you
      can, and you walks when you must. Lord forbid I should rob such a
      gentleman as you!'
    
    
      One who feels a death, is for the hour lifted above the satire of
      postillions. A good genius prompted Evan to avoid the silly squabble that
      might have ensued and made him ridiculous. He took the money, quietly
      saying, 'Thank you.'
    
    
      Not to lose his vantage, the postillion, though a little staggered by the
      move, rejoined: 'Don't mention it.'
    
    
      Evan then said: 'Good night, my man. I won't wish, for your sake, that we
      changed places. You would have to walk fifty miles to be in time for your
      father's funeral. Good night.'
    
    
      'You are it to look at!' was the postillion's comment, seeing my gentleman
      depart with great strides. He did not speak offensively; rather, it
      seemed, to appease his conscience for the original mistake he had
      committed, for subsequently came, 'My oath on it, I don't get took in
      again by a squash hat in a hurry!'
    
    
      Unaware of the ban he had, by a sixpenny stamp, put upon an unoffending
      class, Evan went ahead, hearing the wheels of the chariot still dragging
      the road in his rear. The postillion was in a dissatisfied state of mind.
      He had asked and received more than his due. But in the matter of his
      sweet self, he had been choused, as he termed it. And my gentleman had
      baffled him, he could not quite tell how; but he had been got the better
      of; his sarcasms had not stuck, and returned to rankle in the bosom of
      their author. As a Jew, therefore, may eye an erewhile bondsman who has
      paid the bill, but stands out against excess of interest on legal grounds,
      the postillion regarded Evan, of whom he was now abreast, eager for a
      controversy.
    
    
      'Fine night,' said the postillion, to begin, and was answered by a short
      assent. 'Lateish for a poor man to be out       don't you think sir, eh?'
    
    
      'I ought to think so,' said Evan, mastering the shrewd unpleasantness he
      felt in the colloquy forced on him.
    
    
      'Oh, you! you're a gentleman!' the postillion ejaculated.
    
    
      'You see I have no money.'
    
    
      'Feel it, too, sir.'
    
    
      'I am sorry you should be the victim.'
    
    
      'Victim!' the postillion seized on an objectionable word. 'I ain't no
      victim, unless you was up to a joke with me, sir, just now. Was that the
      game?'
    
    
      Evan informed him that he never played jokes with money, or on men.
    
    
      'Cause it looks like it, sir, to go to offer a poor chap sixpence.' The
      postillion laughed hollow from the end of his lungs. 'Sixpence for a
      night's work! It is a joke, if you don't mean it for one. Why, do you
      know, sir, I could go       there, I don't care where it is!       I could
      go before any magistrate livin', and he'd make ye pay. It's a charge, as
      custom is, and he'd make ye pay. Or p'rhaps you're a goin' on my
      generosity, and 'll say, he gev back that sixpence! Well! I shouldn't a'
      thought a gentleman'd make that his defence before a magistrate. But
      there, my man! if it makes ye happy, keep it. But you take my advice, sir.
      When you hires a chariot, see you've got the shiners. And don't you go
      never again offerin' a sixpence to a poor man for a night's work. They
      don't like it. It hurts their feelin's. Don't you forget that, sir. Lay
      that up in your mind.'
    
    
      Now the postillion having thus relieved himself, jeeringly asked
      permission to smoke a pipe. To which Evan said, 'Pray, smoke, if it
      pleases you.' And the postillion, hardly mollified, added, 'The baccy's
      paid for,' and smoked.
    
    
      As will sometimes happen, the feelings of the man who had spoken out and
      behaved doubtfully, grew gentle and Christian, whereas those of the man
      whose bearing under the trial had been irreproachable were much the
      reverse. The postillion smoked       he was a lord on his horse; he beheld
      my gentleman trudging in the dust. Awhile he enjoyed the contrast,
      dividing his attention between the footfarer and moon. To have had the
      last word is always a great thing; and to have given my gentleman a
      lecture, because he shunned a dispute, also counts. And then there was the
      poor young fellow trudging to his father's funeral! The postillion chose
      to remember that now. In reality, he allowed, he had not very much to
      complain of, and my gentleman's courteous avoidance of provocation (the
      apparent fact that he, the postillion, had humbled him and got the better
      of him, equally, it may be), acted on his fine English spirit. I should
      not like to leave out the tobacco in this good change that was wrought in
      him. However, he presently astonished Evan by pulling up his horses, and
      crying that he was on his way to Hillford to bait, and saw no reason why
      he should not take a lift that part of the road, at all events. Evan
      thanked him briefly, but declined, and paced on with his head bent.
    
    
      'It won't cost you nothing-not a sixpence!' the postillion sang out,
      pursuing him. 'Come, sir! be a man! I ain't a hintin' at anything       jump
      in.'
    
    
      Evan again declined, and looked out for a side path to escape the fellow,
      whose bounty was worse to him than his abuse, and whose mention of the
      sixpence was unlucky.
    
    
      'Dash it!' cried the postillion, 'you're going down to a funeral       I
      think you said your father's, sir       you may as well try and get there
      respectable       as far as I go. It's one to me whether you're in or out;
      the horses won't feel it, and I do wish you'd take a lift and welcome.
      It's because you're too much of a gentleman to be beholden to a poor man,
      I suppose!'
    
    
      Evan's young pride may have had a little of that base mixture in it, and
      certainly he would have preferred that the invitation had not been made to
      him; but he was capable of appreciating what the rejection of a piece of
      friendliness involved, and as he saw that the man was sincere, he did
      violence to himself, and said: 'Very well; then I'll jump in.'
    
    
      The postillion was off his horse in a twinkling, and trotted his bandy
      legs to undo the door, as to a gentleman who paid. This act of service
      Evan valued.
    
    
      'Suppose I were to ask you to take the sixpence now?' he said, turning
      round, with one foot on the step.
    
    
      'Well, sir,' the postillion sent his hat aside to answer. 'I don't want it       I'd
      rather not have it; but there! I'll take it       dash the sixpence! and
      we'll cry quits.'
    
    
      Evan, surprised and pleased with him, dropped the bit of money in his
      hand, saying: 'It will fill a pipe for you. While you 're smoking it,
      think of me as in your debt. You're the only man I ever owed a penny to.'
    
    
      The postillion put it in a side pocket apart, and observed: 'A sixpence
      kindly meant is worth any crown-piece that's grudged       that it is! In
      you jump, sir. It's a jolly night!'
    
    
      Thus may one, not a conscious sage, play the right tune on this human
      nature of ours: by forbearance, put it in the wrong; and then, by not
      refusing the burden of an obligation, confer something better. The
      instrument is simpler than we are taught to fancy. But it was doubtless
      owing to a strong emotion in his soul, as well as to the stuff he was made
      of, that the youth behaved as he did. We are now and then above our own
      actions; seldom on a level with them. Evan, I dare say, was long in
      learning to draw any gratification from the fact that he had achieved
      without money the unparalleled conquest of a man. Perhaps he never knew
      what immediate influence on his fortune this episode effected.
    
    
      At Hillford they went their different ways. The postillion wished him good
      speed, and Evan shook his hand. He did so rather abruptly, for the
      postillion was fumbling at his pocket, and evidently rounding about a
      proposal in his mind.
    
    
      My gentleman has now the road to himself. Money is the clothing of a
      gentleman: he may wear it well or ill. Some, you will mark, carry great
      quantities of it gracefully: some, with a stinted supply, present a decent
      appearance: very few, I imagine, will bear inspection, who are absolutely
      stripped of it. All, save the shameless, are toiling to escape that trial.
      My gentleman, treading the white highway across the solitary heaths, that
      swell far and wide to the moon, is, by the postillion, who has seen him,
      pronounced no sham. Nor do I think the opinion of any man worthless, who
      has had the postillion's authority for speaking. But it is, I am told, a
      finer test to embellish much gentleman-apparel, than to walk with dignity
      totally unadorned. This simply tries the soundness of our faculties: that
      tempts them in erratic directions. It is the difference between active and
      passive excellence. As there is hardly any situation, however, so
      interesting to reflect upon as that of a man without a penny in his
      pocket, and a gizzard full of pride, we will leave Mr. Evan Harrington to
      what fresh adventures may befall him, walking toward the funeral plumes of
      the firs, under the soft midsummer flush, westward, where his father lies.

      Rare as epic song is the man who is thorough in what he does. And happily
      so; for in life he subjugates us, and he makes us bondsmen to his ashes.
      It was in the order of things that the great Mel should be borne to his
      final resting-place by a troop of creditors. You have seen (since the
      occasion demands a pompous simile) clouds that all day cling about the
      sun, and, in seeking to obscure him, are compelled to blaze in his livery
      at fall of night they break from him illumined, hang mournfully above him,
      and wear his natural glories long after he is gone. Thus, then, these
      worthy fellows, faithful to him to the dust, fulfilled Mel's triumphant
      passage amongst them, and closed his career.
    
    
      To regale them when they returned, Mrs. Mel, whose mind was not intent on
      greatness, was occupied in spreading meat and wine. Mrs. Fiske assisted
      her, as well as she could, seeing that one hand was entirely engaged by
      her handkerchief. She had already stumbled, and dropped a glass, which had
      brought on her sharp condemnation from her aunt, who bade her sit down, or
      go upstairs to have her cry out, and then return to be serviceable.
    
    
      'Oh! I can't help it!' sobbed Mrs. Fiske. 'That he should be carried away,
      and none of his children to see him the last time! I can understand Louisa       and
      Harriet, too, perhaps? But why could not Caroline? And that they should be
      too fine ladies to let their brother come and bury his father. Oh! it does
      seem              '
    
    
      Mrs. Fiske fell into a chair, and surrendered to grief.
    
    
      'Where is the cold tongue?' said Mrs. Mel to Sally, the maid, in a brief
      under-voice.
    
    
      'Please mum, Jacko              !'
    
    
      'He must be whipped. You are a careless slut.'
    
    
      'Please, I can't think of everybody and everything, and poor master              '
    
    
      Sally plumped on a seat, and took sanctuary under her apron. Mrs. Mel
      glanced at the pair, continuing her labour.
    
    
      'Oh, aunt, aunt!' cried Mrs. Fiske, 'why didn't you put it off for another
      day, to give Evan a chance?'
    
    
      'Master 'd have kept another two days, he would!' whimpered Sally.
    
    
      'Oh, aunt! to think!' cried Mrs. Fiske.
    
    
      'And his coffin not bearin' of his spurs!' whimpered Sally.
    
    
      Mrs. Mel interrupted them by commanding Sally to go to the drawing-room,
      and ask a lady there, of the name of Mrs. Wishaw, whether she would like
      to have some lunch sent up to her. Mrs. Fiske was requested to put towels
      in Evan's bedroom.
    
    
      'Yes, aunt, if you're not infatuated!' said Mrs. Fiske, as she prepared to
      obey; while Sally, seeing that her public exhibition of sorrow and
      sympathy could be indulged but an instant longer, unwound herself for a
      violent paroxysm, blurting between stops:
    
    
      'If he'd ony've gone to his last bed comfortable!... If he'd ony 've been
      that decent as not for to go to his last bed with his clothes on! ... If
      he'd ony've had a comfortable sheet!... It makes a woman feel cold to
      think of him full dressed there, as if he was goin' to be a soldier on the
      Day o' Judgement!'
    
    
      To let people speak was a maxim of Mrs. Mel's, and a wise one for any form
      of society when emotions are very much on the surface. She continued her
      arrangements quietly, and, having counted the number of plates and
      glasses, and told off the guests on her fingers, she, sat down to await
      them.
    
    
      The first one who entered the room was her son.
    
    
      'You have come,' said Mrs. Mel, flushing slightly, but otherwise outwardly
      calm.
    
    
      'You didn't suppose I should stay away from you, mother?'
    
    
      Evan kissed her cheek.
    
    
      'I knew you would not.'
    
    
      Mrs. Mel examined him with those eyes of hers that compassed objects in a
      single glance. She drew her finger on each side of her upper lip, and half
      smiled, saying:
    
    
      'That won't do here.'
    
    
      'What?' asked Evan, and proceeded immediately to make inquiries about her
      health, which she satisfied with a nod.
    
    
      'You saw him lowered, Van?'
    
    
      'Yes, mother.'
    
    
      'Then go and wash yourself, for you are dirty, and then come and take your
      place at the head of the table.'
    
    
      'Must I sit here, mother?'
    
    
      'Without a doubt       you must. You know your room. Quick!'
    
    
      In this manner their first interview passed.
    
    
      Mrs. Fiske rushed in to exclaim:
    
    
      'So, you were right, aunt       he has come. I met him on the stairs. Oh!
      how like dear uncle Mel he looks, in the militia, with that moustache. I
      just remember him as a child; and, oh, what a gentleman he is!'
    
    
      At the end of the sentence Mrs. Mel's face suddenly darkened: she said, in
      a deep voice:
    
    
      'Don't dare to talk that nonsense before him, Ann.'
    
    
      Mrs. Fiske looked astonished.
    
    
      'What have I done, aunt?'
    
    
      'He shan't be ruined by a parcel of fools,' said Mrs. Mel. 'There, go!
      Women have no place here.'
    
    
      'How the wretches can force themselves to touch a morsel, after this
      morning!' Mrs. Fiske exclaimed, glancing at the table.
    
    
      'Men must eat,' said Mrs. Mel.
    
    
      The mourners were heard gathering outside the door. Mrs. Fiske escaped
      into the kitchen. Mrs. Mel admitted them into the parlour, bowing much
      above the level of many of the heads that passed her.
    
    
      Assembled were Messrs. Barnes, Kilne, and Grossby, whom we know; Mr.
      Doubleday, the ironmonger; Mr. Joyce, the grocer; Mr. Perkins, commonly
      called Lawyer Perkins; Mr. Welbeck, the pier-master of Lymport;
      Bartholomew Fiske; Mr. Coxwell, a Fallow field maltster, brewer, and
      farmer; creditors of various dimensions, all of them. Mr. Goren coming
      last, behind his spectacles.
    
    
      'My son will be with you directly, to preside,' said Mrs. Mel. 'Accept my
      thanks for the respect you have shown my husband. I wish you good
      morning.'
    
    
      'Morning, ma'am,' answered several voices, and Mrs. Mel retired.
    
    
      The mourners then set to work to relieve their hats of the appendages of
      crape. An undertaker's man took possession of the long black cloaks. The
      gloves were generally pocketed.
    
    
      'That's my second black pair this year,' said Joyce.
    
    
      'They'll last a time to come. I don't need to buy gloves while neighbours
      pop off.'
    
    
      'Undertakers' gloves seem to me as if they're made for mutton fists,'
      remarked Welbeck; upon which Kilne nudged Barnes, the butcher, with a
      sharp 'Aha!' and Barnes observed:
    
    
      'Oh! I never wear 'em       they does for my boys on Sundays. I smoke a
      pipe at home.'
    
    
      The Fallow field farmer held his length of crape aloft and inquired: 'What
      shall do with this?'
    
    
      'Oh, you keep it,' said one or two.
    
    
      Coxwell rubbed his chin. 'Don't like to rob the widder.'
    
    
      'What's left goes to the undertaker?' asked Grossby.
    
    
      'To be sure,' said Barnes; and Kilne added: 'It's a job': Lawyer Perkins
      ejaculating confidently, 'Perquisites of office, gentlemen; perquisites of
      office!' which settled the dispute and appeased every conscience.
    
    
      A survey of the table ensued. The mourners felt hunger, or else thirst;
      but had not, it appeared, amalgamated the two appetites as yet. Thirst was
      the predominant declaration; and Grossby, after an examination of the
      decanters, unctuously deduced the fact, which he announced, that port and
      sherry were present.
    
    
      'Try the port,' said Kilne.
    
    
      'Good?' Barnes inquired.
    
    
      A very intelligent 'I ought to know,' with a reserve of regret at the
      extension of his intimacy with the particular vintage under that roof, was
      winked by Kilne.
    
    
      Lawyer Perkins touched the arm of a mourner about to be experimental on
      Kilne's port       
    
    
      'I think we had better wait till young Mr. Harrington takes the table,
      don't you see?'
    
    
      'Yes,-ah!' croaked Goren. 'The head of the family, as the saying goes!'
    
    
      'I suppose we shan't go into business to-day?' Joyce carelessly observed.
    
    
      Lawyer Perkins answered:
    
    
      'No. You can't expect it. Mr. Harrington has led me to anticipate that he
      will appoint a day. Don't you see?'
    
    
      'Oh! I see,' returned Joyce. 'I ain't in such a hurry. What's he doing?'
    
    
      Doubleday, whose propensities were waggish, suggested 'shaving,' but half
      ashamed of it, since the joke missed, fell to as if he were soaping his
      face, and had some trouble to contract his jaw.
    
    
      The delay in Evan's attendance on the guests of the house was caused by
      the fact that Mrs. Mel had lain in wait for him descending, to warn him
      that he must treat them with no supercilious civility, and to tell him
      partly the reason why. On hearing the potential relations in which they
      stood toward the estate of his father, Evan hastily and with the assurance
      of a son of fortune, said they should be paid.
    
    
      'That's what they would like to hear,' said Mrs. Mel. 'You may just
      mention it when they're going to leave. Say you will fix a day to meet
      them.'
    
    
      'Every farthing!' pursued Evan, on whom the tidings were beginning to
      operate. 'What! debts? my poor father!'
    
    
      'And a thumping sum, Van. You will open your eyes wider.'
    
    
      'But it shall be paid, mother,       it shall be paid. Debts? I hate them.
      I'd slave night and day to pay them.'
    
    
      Mrs. Mel spoke in a more positive tense: 'And so will I, Van. Now, go.'
    
    
      It mattered little to her what sort of effect on his demeanour her
      revelation produced, so long as the resolve she sought to bring him to was
      nailed in his mind; and she was a woman to knock and knock again, till it
      was firmly fixed there. With a strong purpose, and no plans, there were
      few who could resist what, in her circle, she willed; not even a youth who
      would gaily have marched to the scaffold rather than stand behind a
      counter. A purpose wedded to plans may easily suffer shipwreck; but an
      unfettered purpose that moulds circumstances as they arise, masters us,
      and is terrible. Character melts to it, like metal in the steady furnace.
      The projector of plots is but a miserable gambler and votary of chances.
      Of a far higher quality is the will that can subdue itself to wait, and
      lay no petty traps for opportunity. Poets may fable of such a will, that
      it makes the very heavens conform to it; or, I may add, what is almost
      equal thereto, one who would be a gentleman, to consent to be a tailor.
      The only person who ever held in his course against Mrs. Mel, was Mel,       her
      husband; but, with him, she was under the physical fascination of her
      youth, and it never left her. In her heart she barely blamed him. What he
      did, she took among other inevitable matters.
    
    
      The door closed upon Evan, and waiting at the foot, of the stairs a minute
      to hear how he was received, Mrs. Mel went to the kitchen and called the
      name of Dandy, which brought out an ill-built, low-browed, small man, in a
      baggy suit of black, who hopped up to her with a surly salute. Dandy was a
      bird Mrs. Mel had herself brought down, and she had for him something of a
      sportsman's regard for his victim. Dandy was the cleaner of boots and
      runner of errands in the household of Melchisedec, having originally
      entered it on a dark night by the cellar. Mrs. Mel, on that occasion, was
      sleeping in her dressing-gown, to be ready to give the gallant night-hawk,
      her husband, the service he might require on his return to the nest.
      Hearing a suspicious noise below, she rose, and deliberately loaded a pair
      of horse-pistols, weapons Mel had worn in his holsters in the heroic days
      gone; and with these she stepped downstairs straight to the cellar,
      carrying a lantern at her girdle. She could not only load, but present and
      fire. Dandy was foremost in stating that she called him forth steadily,
      three times, before the pistol was discharged. He admitted that he was
      frightened, and incapable of speech, at the apparition of the tall,
      terrific woman. After the third time of asking he had the ball lodged in
      his leg and fell. Mrs. Mel was in the habit of bearing heavier weights
      than Dandy. She made no ado about lugging him to a chamber, where, with
      her own hands (for this woman had some slight knowledge of surgery, and
      was great in herbs and drugs) she dressed his wound, and put him to bed;
      crying contempt (ever present in Dandy's memory) at such a poor creature
      undertaking the work of housebreaker. Taught that he really was a poor
      creature for the work, Dandy, his nursing over, begged to be allowed to
      stop and wait on Mrs. Mel; and she who had, like many strong natures, a
      share of pity for the objects she despised, did not cast him out. A jerk
      in his gait, owing to the bit of lead Mrs. Mel had dropped into him, and a
      little, perhaps, to her self-satisfied essay in surgical science on his
      person, earned him the name he went by.
    
    
      When her neighbours remonstrated with her for housing a reprobate, Mrs.
      Mel would say: 'Dandy is well-fed and well-physicked: there's no harm in
      Dandy'; by which she may have meant that the food won his gratitude, and
      the physic reduced his humours. She had observed human nature. At any
      rate, Dandy was her creature; and the great Mel himself rallied her about
      her squire.
    
    
      'When were you drunk last?' was Mrs. Mel's address to Dandy, as he stood
      waiting for orders.
    
    
      He replied to it in an altogether injured way:
    
    
      'There, now; you've been and called me away from my dinner to ask me that.
      Why, when I had the last chance, to be sure.'
    
    
      'And you were at dinner in your new black suit?'
    
    
      'Well,' growled Dandy, 'I borrowed Sally's apron. Seems I can't please
      ye.'
    
    
      Mrs. Mel neither enjoined nor cared for outward forms of respect, where
      she was sure of complete subserviency. If Dandy went beyond the limits,
      she gave him an extra dose. Up to the limits he might talk as he pleased,
      in accordance with Mrs. Mel's maxim, that it was a necessary relief to all
      talking creatures.
    
    
      'Now, take off your apron,' she said, 'and wash your hands, dirty pig, and
      go and wait at table in there'; she pointed to the parlour-door: 'Come
      straight to me when everybody has left.'
    
    
      'Well, there I am with the bottles again,' returned Dandy. 'It 's your
      fault this time, mind! I'll come as straight as I can.'
    
    
      Dandy turned away to perform her bidding, and Mrs. Mel ascended to the
      drawing-room to sit with Mrs. Wishaw, who was, as she told all who chose
      to hear, an old flame of Mel's, and was besides, what Mrs. Mel thought
      more of, the wife of Mel's principal creditor, a wholesale dealer in
      cloth, resident in London.
    
    
      The conviviality of the mourners did not disturb the house. Still, men who
      are not accustomed to see the colour of wine every day, will sit and enjoy
      it, even upon solemn occasions, and the longer they sit the more they
      forget the matter that has brought them together. Pleading their wives and
      shops, however, they released Evan from his miserable office late in the
      afternoon.
    
    
      His mother came down to him,       and saying, 'I see how you did the
      journey       you walked it,' told him to follow her.
    
    
      'Yes, mother,' Evan yawned, 'I walked part of the way. I met a fellow in a
      gig about ten miles out of Fallow field, and he gave me a lift to
      Flatsham. I just reached Lymport in time, thank Heaven! I wouldn't have
      missed that! By the way, I've satisfied these men.'
    
    
      'Oh!' said Mrs. Mel.
    
    
      'They wanted       one or two of them       what a penance it is to have
      to sit among those people an hour!       they wanted to ask me about the
      business, but I silenced them. I told them to meet me here this day week.'
    
    
      Mrs. Mel again said 'Oh!' and, pushing into one of the upper rooms,
      'Here's your bedroom, Van, just as you left it.'
    
    
      'Ah, so it is,' muttered Evan, eyeing a print. 'The Douglas and the Percy:
      "he took the dead man by the hand." What an age it seems since I last saw
      that. There's Sir Hugh Montgomery on horseback       he hasn't moved.
      Don't you remember my father calling it the Battle of Tit-for-Tat? Gallant
      Percy! I know he wished he had lived in those days of knights and
      battles.'
    
    
      'It does not much signify whom one has to make clothes for,' observed Mrs.
      Mel. Her son happily did not mark her.
    
    
      'I think we neither of us were made for the days of pence and pounds,' he
      continued. 'Now, mother, sit down, and talk to me about him. Did he
      mention me? Did he give me his blessing? I hope he did not suffer. I'd
      have given anything to press his hand,' and looking wistfully at the Percy
      lifting the hand of Douglas dead, Evan's eyes filled with big tears.
    
    
      'He suffered very little,' returned Mrs. Mel, 'and his last words were
      about you.'
    
    
      'What were they?' Evan burst out.
    
    
      'I will tell you another time. Now undress, and go to bed. When I talk to
      you, Van, I want a cool head to listen. You do nothing but yawn
      yard-measures.'
    
    
      The mouth of the weary youth instinctively snapped short the abhorred
      emblem.
    
    
      'Here, I will help you, Van.'
    
    
      In spite of his remonstrances and petitions for talk, she took off his
      coat and waistcoat, contemptuously criticizing the cloth of foreign
      tailors and their absurd cut.
    
    
      'Have you heard from Louisa?' asked Evan.
    
    
      'Yes, yes       about your sisters by-and-by. Now, be good, and go to
      bed.'
    
    
      She still treated him like a boy, whom she was going to force to the
      resolution of a man.
    
    
      Dandy's sleeping-room was on the same floor as Evan's. Thither, when she
      had quitted her son, she directed her steps. She had heard Dandy tumble
      up-stairs the moment his duties were over, and knew what to expect when
      the bottles had been in his way; for drink made Dandy savage, and a terror
      to himself. It was her command to him that, when he happened to come
      across liquor, he should immediately seek his bedroom and bolt the door,
      and Dandy had got the habit of obeying her. On this occasion he was
      vindictive against her, seeing that she had delivered him over to his
      enemy with malice prepense. A good deal of knocking, and summoning of
      Dandy by name, was required before she was admitted, and the sight of her
      did not delight him, as he testified.
    
    
      'I 'm drunk!' he bawled. 'Will that do for ye?'
    
    
      Mrs. Mel stood with her two hands crossed above her apron-string, noting
      his sullen lurking eye with the calm of a tamer of beasts.
    
    
      'You go out of the room; I'm drunk!' Dandy repeated, and pitched forward
      on the bed-post, in the middle of an oath.
    
    
      She understood that it was pure kindness on Dandy's part to bid her go and
      be out of his reach; and therefore, on his becoming so abusive as to be
      menacing, she, without a shade of anger, and in the most unruffled manner,
      administered to him the remedy she had reserved, in the shape of a smart
      box on the ear, which sent him flat to the floor. He rose, after two or
      three efforts, quite subdued.
    
    
      'Now, Dandy, sit on the edge of the bed.'
    
    
      Dandy sat on the extreme edge, and Mrs. Mel pursued:
    
    
      'Now, Dandy, tell me what your master said at the table.'
    
    
      'Talked at 'em like a lord, he did,' said Dandy, stupidly consoling the
      boxed ear.
    
    
      'What were his words?'
    
    
      Dandy's peculiarity was, that he never remembered anything save when
      drunk, and Mrs. Mel's dose had rather sobered him. By degrees, scratching
      at his head haltingly, he gave the context.
    
    
      "'Gentlemen, I hear for the first time, you've claims against my poor
      father. Nobody shall ever say he died, and any man was the worse for it.
      I'll meet you next week, and I'll bind myself by law. Here's Lawyer
      Perkins. No; Mr. Perkins. I'll pay off every penny. Gentlemen, look upon
      me as your debtor, and not my father."'
    
    
      Delivering this with tolerable steadiness, Dandy asked, 'Will that do?'
    
    
      'That will do,' said Mrs. Mel. 'I'll send you up some tea presently. Lie
      down, Dandy.'
    
    
      The house was dark and silent when Evan, refreshed by his rest, descended
      to seek his mother. She was sitting alone in the parlour. With a
      tenderness which Mrs. Mel permitted rather than encouraged, Evan put his
      arm round her neck, and kissed her many times. One of the symptoms of
      heavy sorrow, a longing for the signs of love, made Evan fondle his
      mother, and bend over her yearningly. Mrs. Mel said once: 'Dear Van; good
      boy!' and quietly sat through his caresses.
    
    
      'Sitting up for me, mother?' he whispered.
    
    
      'Yes, Van; we may as well have our talk out.'
    
    
      'Ah!' he took a chair close by her side, 'tell me my father's last words.'
    
    
      'He said he hoped you would never be a tailor.'
    
    
      Evan's forehead wrinkled up. 'There's not much fear of that, then!'
    
    
      His mother turned her face on him, and examined him with a rigorous
      placidity; all her features seeming to bear down on him. Evan did not like
      the look.
    
    
      'You object to trade, Van?'
    
    
      'Yes, decidedly, mother-hate it; but that's not what I want to talk to you
      about. Didn't my father speak of me much?'
    
    
      'He desired that you should wear his militia sword, if you got a
      commission.'
    
    
      'I have rather given up hope of the Army,' said Evan.
    
    
      Mrs. Mel requested him to tell her what a colonel's full pay amounted to;
      and again, the number of years it required, on a rough calculation, to
      attain that grade. In reply to his statement she observed: 'A tailor might
      realize twice the sum in a quarter of the time.'
    
    
      'What if he does-double, or treble?' cried Evan, impetuously; and to avoid
      the theme, and cast off the bad impression it produced on him, he rubbed
      his hands, and said: 'I want to talk to you about my prospects, mother.'
    
    
      'What are they?' Mrs. Mel inquired.
    
    
      The severity of her mien and sceptical coldness of her speech caused him
      to inspect them suddenly, as if she had lent him her eyes. He put them by,
      till the gold should recover its natural shine, saying: 'By the way,
      mother, I 've written the half of a History of Portugal.'
    
    
      'Have you?' said Mrs. Mel. 'For Louisa?'
    
    
      'No, mother, of course not: to sell it. Albuquerque! what a splendid
      fellow he was!'
    
    
      Informing him that he knew she abominated foreign names, she said: 'And
      your prospects are, writing Histories of Portugal?'
    
    
      'No, mother. I was going to tell you, I expect a Government appointment.
      Mr. Jocelyn likes my work       I think he likes me. You know, I was his
      private secretary for ten months.'
    
    
      'You write a good hand,' his mother interposed.
    
    
      'And I'm certain I was born for diplomacy.'
    
    
      'For an easy chair, and an ink-dish before you, and lacqueys behind.
      What's to be your income, Van?'
    
    
      Evan carelessly remarked that he must wait and see.
    
    
      'A very proper thing to do,' said Mrs. Mel; for now that she had fixed him
      to some explanation of his prospects, she could condescend in her stiff
      way to banter.
    
    
      Slightly touched by it, Evan pursued, half laughing, as men do who wish to
      propitiate common sense on behalf of what seems tolerably absurd: 'It 's
      not the immediate income, you know, mother: one thinks of one's future. In
      the diplomatic service, as Louisa says, you come to be known to Ministers
      gradually, I mean. That is, they hear of you; and if you show you have
      some capacity       Louisa wants me to throw it up in time, and stand for
      Parliament. Andrew, she thinks, would be glad to help me to his seat. Once
      in Parliament, and known to Ministers, you       your career is open to
      you.'
    
    
      In justice to Mr. Evan Harrington, it must be said, he built up this
      extraordinary card-castle to dazzle his mother's mind: he had lost his
      right grasp of her character for the moment, because of an undefined
      suspicion of something she intended, and which sent him himself to take
      refuge in those flimsy structures; while the very altitude he reached
      beguiled his imagination, and made him hope to impress hers.
    
    
      Mrs. Mel dealt it one fillip. 'And in the meantime how are you to live,
      and pay the creditors?'
    
    
      Though Evan answered cheerfully, 'Oh, they will wait, and I can live on
      anything,' he was nevertheless floundering on the ground amid the ruins of
      the superb edifice; and his mother, upright and rigid, continuing, 'You
      can live on anything, and they will wait, and call your father a rogue,'
      he started, grievously bitten by one of the serpents of earth.
    
    
      'Good heaven, mother! what are you saying?'
    
    
      'That they will call your father a rogue, and will have a right to,' said
      the relentless woman.
    
    
      'Not while I live!' Evan exclaimed.
    
    
      'You may stop one mouth with your fist, but you won't stop a dozen, Van.'
    
    
      Evan jumped up and walked the room.
    
    
      'What am I to do?' he cried. 'I will pay everything. I will bind myself to
      pay every farthing. What more can I possibly do?'
    
    
      'Make the money,' said Mrs. Mel's deep voice.
    
    
      Evan faced her: 'My dear mother, you are very unjust and inconsiderate. I
      have been working and doing my best. I promise       what do the debts
      amount to?'
    
    
      'Something like L5000 in all, Van.'
    
    
      'Very well.' Youth is not alarmed by the sound of big sums. 'Very well       I
      will pay it.'
    
    
      Evan looked as proud as if he had just clapped down the full amount on the
      table.
    
    
      'Out of the History of Portugal, half written, and the prospect of a
      Government appointment?'
    
    
      Mrs. Mel raised her eyelids to him.
    
    
      'In time-in time, mother!'
    
    
      'Mention your proposal to the creditors when you meet them this day week,'
      she said.
    
    
      Neither of them spoke for several minutes. Then Evan came close to her,
      saying:
    
    
      'What is it you want of me, mother?'
    
    
      'I want nothing, Van       I can support myself.'
    
    
      'But what would you have me do, mother?'
    
    
      'Be honest; do your duty, and don't be a fool about it.'
    
    
      'I will try,' he rejoined. 'You tell me to make the money. Where and how
      can I make it? I am perfectly willing to work.'
    
    
      'In this house,' said Mrs. Mel; and, as this was pretty clear speaking,
      she stood up to lend her figure to it.
    
    
      'Here?' faltered Evan. 'What! be a               '
    
    
      'Tailor!' The word did not sting her tongue.
    
    
      'I? Oh, that's quite impossible!' said Evan. And visions of leprosy, and
      Rose shrinking her skirts from contact with him, shadowed out and away in
      his mind.
    
    
      'Understand your choice!' Mrs. Mel imperiously spoke. 'What are brains
      given you for? To be played the fool with by idiots and women? You have
      L5000 to pay to save your father from being called a rogue. You can only
      make the money in one way, which is open to you. This business might
      produce a thousand pounds a-year and more. In seven or eight years you may
      clear your father's name, and live better all the time than many of your
      bankrupt gentlemen. You have told the creditors you will pay them. Do you
      think they're gaping fools, to be satisfied by a History of Portugal? If
      you refuse to take the business at once, they will sell me up, and quite
      right too. Understand your choice. There's Mr. Goren has promised to have
      you in London a couple of months, and teach you what he can. He is a kind
      friend. Would any of your gentlemen acquaintance do the like for you?
      Understand your choice. You will be a beggar       the son of a rogue       or
      an honest man who has cleared his father's name!'
    
    
      During this strenuously uttered allocution, Mrs. Mel, though her chest
      heaved but faintly against her crossed hands, showed by the dilatation of
      her eyes, and the light in them, that she felt her words. There is that in
      the aspect of a fine frame breathing hard facts, which, to a youth who has
      been tumbled headlong from his card-castles and airy fabrics, is
      masterful, and like the pressure of a Fate. Evan drooped his head.
    
    
      'Now,' said Mrs. Mel, 'you shall have some supper.'
    
    
      Evan told her he could not eat.
    
    
      'I insist upon your eating,' said Mrs. Mel; 'empty stomachs are foul
      counsellors.'
    
    
      'Mother! do you want to drive me mad?' cried Evan.
    
    
      She looked at him to see whether the string she held him by would bear the
      slight additional strain: decided not to press a small point.
    
    
      'Then go to bed and sleep on it,' she said       sure of him       and
      gave her cheek for his kiss, for she never performed the operation, but
      kept her mouth, as she remarked, for food and speech, and not for
      slobbering mummeries.
    
    
      Evan returned to his solitary room. He sat on the bed and tried to think,
      oppressed by horrible sensations of self-contempt, that caused whatever he
      touched to sicken him.
    
    
      There were the Douglas and the Percy on the wall. It was a happy and a
      glorious time, was it not, when men lent each other blows that killed
      outright; when to be brave and cherish noble feelings brought honour; when
      strength of arm and steadiness of heart won fortune; when the fair stars
      of earth       sweet women       wakened and warmed the love of squires of
      low degree. This legacy of the dead man's hand! Evan would have paid it
      with his blood; but to be in bondage all his days to it; through it to
      lose all that was dear to him; to wear the length of a loathed existence!       we
      should pardon a young man's wretchedness at the prospect, for it was in a
      time before our joyful era of universal equality. Yet he never cast a
      shade of blame upon his father.
    
    
      The hours moved on, and he found himself staring at his small candle,
      which struggled more and more faintly with the morning light, like his own
      flickering ambition against the facts of life.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER VIII. INTRODUCES AN ECCENTRIC
    
    
      At the Aurora       one of those rare antiquated taverns, smelling of
      comfortable time and solid English fare, that had sprung up in the great
      coffee days, when taverns were clubs, and had since subsisted on the
      attachment of steady bachelor Templars there had been dismay, and even
      sorrow, for a month. The most constant patron of the establishment       an
      old gentleman who had dined there for seven-and-twenty years, four days in
      the week, off dishes dedicated to the particular days, and had grown grey
      with the landlady, the cook, and the head-waiter       this old gentleman
      had abruptly withheld his presence. Though his name, his residence, his
      occupation, were things only to be speculated on at the Aurora, he was
      very well known there, and as men are best to be known: that is to say, by
      their habits. Some affection for him also was felt. The landlady looked on
      him as a part of the house. The cook and the waiter were accustomed to
      receive acceptable compliments from him monthly. His precise words, his
      regular ancient jokes, his pint of Madeira and after-pint of Port, his
      antique bow to the landlady, passing out and in, his method of spreading
      his table-napkin on his lap and looking up at the ceiling ere he fell to,
      and how he talked to himself during the repast, and indulged in short
      chuckles, and the one look of perfect felicity that played over his
      features when he had taken his first sip of Port       these were matters
      it pained them at the Aurora to have to remember.
    
    
      For three weeks the resolution not to regard him as of the past was
      general. The Aurora was the old gentleman's home. Men do not play truant
      from home at sixty years of age. He must, therefore, be seriously
      indisposed. The kind heart of the landlady fretted to think he might have
      no soul to nurse and care for him; but she kept his corner near the
      fire-place vacant, and took care that his pint of Madeira was there. The
      belief was gaining ground that he had gone, and that nothing but his ghost
      would ever sit there again. Still the melancholy ceremony continued: for
      the landlady was not without a secret hope, that in spite of his reserve
      and the mystery surrounding him, he would have sent her a last word. The
      cook and head-waiter, interrogated as to their dealings with the old
      gentleman, testified solemnly to the fact of their having performed their
      duty by him. They would not go against their interests so much as to
      forget one of his ways, they said-taking oath, as it were, by their lower
      nature, in order to be credited: an instinct men have of one another. The
      landlady could not contradict them, for the old gentleman had made no
      complaint; but then she called to memory that fifteen years back, in such
      and such a year, Wednesday's, dish had been, by shameful oversight,
      furnished him for Tuesday's, and he had eaten it quietly, but refused his
      Port; which pathetic event had caused alarm and inquiry, when the error
      was discovered, and apologized for, the old gentleman merely saying,
      'Don't let it happen again.' Next day he drank his Port, as usual, and the
      wheels of the Aurora went smoothly. The landlady was thus justified in
      averring that something had been done by somebody, albeit unable to point
      to anything specific. Women, who are almost as deeply bound to habit as
      old gentlemen, possess more of its spiritual element, and are warned by
      dreams, omens, creepings of the flesh, unwonted chills, suicide of china,
      and other shadowing signs, when a break is to be anticipated, or, has
      occurred. The landlady of the Aurora tavern was visited by none of these,
      and with that beautiful trust which habit gives, and which boastful love
      or vainer earthly qualities would fail in effecting, she ordered that the
      pint of Madeira should stand from six o'clock in the evening till seven       a
      small monument of confidence in him who was at one instant the 'poor old
      dear'; at another, the 'naughty old gad-about'; further, the 'faithless
      old-good-for-nothing'; and again, the 'blessed pet' of the landlady's
      parlour, alternately and indiscriminately apostrophized by herself, her
      sister, and daughter.
    
    
      On the last day of the month a step was heard coming up the long alley
      which led from the riotous scrambling street to the plentiful cheerful
      heart of the Aurora. The landlady knew the step. She checked the natural
      flutterings of her ribbons, toned down the strong simper that was on her
      lips, rose, pushed aside her daughter, and, as the step approached,
      curtsied composedly. Old Habit lifted his hat, and passed. With the same
      touching confidence in the Aurora that the Aurora had in him, he went
      straight to his corner, expressed no surprise at his welcome by the
      Madeira, and thereby apparently indicated that his appearance should enjoy
      a similar immunity.
    
    
      As of old, he called 'Jonathan!' and was not to be disturbed till he did
      so. Seeing that Jonathan smirked and twiddled his napkin, the old
      gentleman added, 'Thursday!'
    
    
      But Jonathan, a man, had not his mistress's keen intuition of the
      deportment necessitated by the case, or was incapable of putting the screw
      upon weak excited nature, for he continued to smirk, and was remarking how
      glad he was, he was sure, and something he had dared to think and almost
      to fear, when the old gentleman called to him, as if he were at the other
      end of the room, 'Will you order Thursday, or not, sir?' Whereat Jonathan
      flew, and two or three cosy diners glanced up from their plates, or the
      paper, smiled, and pursued their capital occupation.
    
    
      'Glad to see me!' the old gentleman muttered, querulously. 'Of course,
      glad to see a customer! Why do you tell me that? Talk! tattle! might as
      well have a woman to wait       just!'
    
    
      He wiped his forehead largely with his handkerchief; as one whom Calamity
      hunted a little too hard in summer weather.
    
    
      'No tumbling-room for the wine, too!'
    
    
      That was his next grievance. He changed the pint of Madeira from his left
      side to his right, and went under his handkerchief again, feverishly. The
      world was severe with this old gentleman.
    
    
      'Ah! clock wrong now!'
    
    
      He leaned back like a man who can no longer carry his burdens, informing
      Jonathan, on his coming up to place the roll of bread and firm butter,
      that he was forty seconds too fast, as if it were a capital offence, and
      he deserved to step into Eternity for outstripping Time.
    
    
      'But, I daresay, you don't understand the importance of a minute,' said
      the old gentleman, bitterly. 'Not you, or any of you. Better if we had run
      a little ahead of your minute, perhaps       and the rest of you! Do you
      think you can cancel the mischief that's done in the world in that minute,
      sir, by hurrying ahead like that? Tell me!'
    
    
      Rather at a loss, Jonathan scanned the clock seriously, and observed that
      it was not quite a minute too fast.
    
    
      The old gentleman pulled out his watch. He grunted that a lying clock was
      hateful to him; subsequently sinking into contemplation of his thumbs,       a
      sign known to Jonathan as indicative of the old gentleman's system having
      resolved, in spite of external outrages, to be fortified with calm to meet
      the repast.
    
    
      It is not fair to go behind an eccentric; but the fact was, this old
      gentleman was slightly ashamed of his month's vagrancy and cruel conduct,
      and cloaked his behaviour toward the Aurora, in all the charges he could
      muster against it. He was very human, albeit an odd form of the race.
    
    
      Happily for his digestion of Thursday, the cook, warned by Jonathan, kept
      the old gentleman's time, not the Aurora's: and the dinner was correct;
      the dinner was eaten in peace; he began to address his plate vigorously,
      poured out his Madeira, and chuckled, as the familiar ideas engendered by
      good wine were revived in him. Jonathan reported at the bar that the old
      gentleman was all right again.
    
    
      One would like here to pause, while our worthy ancient feeds, and indulge
      in a short essay on Habit, to show what a sacred and admirable thing it is
      that makes flimsy Time substantial, and consolidates his triple life. It
      is proof that we have come to the end of dreams and Time's delusions, and
      are determined to sit down at Life's feast and carve for ourselves. Its
      day is the child of yesterday, and has a claim on to-morrow. Whereas those
      who have no such plan of existence and sum of their wisdom to show, the
      winds blow them as they list. Consider, then, mercifully the wrath of him
      on whom carelessness or forgetfulness has brought a snap in the links of
      Habit. You incline to scorn him because, his slippers misplaced, or
      asparagus not on his table the first day of a particular Spring month, he
      gazes blankly and sighs as one who saw the End. To you it may appear
      small. You call to him to be a man. He is: but he is also an immortal, and
      his confidence in unceasing orderly progression is rudely dashed.
    
    
      But the old gentleman has finished his dinner and his Madeira, and says:
      'Now, Jonathan, "thock" the Port!'       his joke when matters have gone
      well: meant to express the sound of the uncorking, probably. The habit of
      making good jokes is rare, as you know: old gentlemen have not yet
      attained to it: nevertheless Jonathan enjoys this one, which has seen a
      generation in and out, for he knows its purport to be, 'My heart is open.'
    
    
      And now is a great time with this old gentleman. He sips, and in his eyes
      the world grows rosy, and he exchanges mute or monosyllable salutes here
      and there. His habit is to avoid converse; but he will let a light remark
      season meditation.
    
    
      He says to Jonathan: 'The bill for the month.'
    
    
      'Yes, sir,' Jonathan replies. 'Would you not prefer, sir, to have the
      items added on to the month ensuing?'
    
    
      'I asked you for the bill of the month,' said the old gentleman, with an
      irritated voice and a twinkle in his eye.
    
    
      Jonathan bowed; but his aspect betrayed perplexity, and that perplexity
      was soon shared by the landlady for Jonathan said, he was convinced the
      old gentleman intended to pay for sixteen days, and the landlady could not
      bring her hand to charge him for more than two. Here was the dilemma
      foreseen by the old gentleman, and it added vastly to the flavour of the
      Port.
    
    
      Pleasantly tickled, he sat gazing at his glass, and let the minutes fly.
      He knew the part he would act in his little farce. If charged for the
      whole month, he would peruse the bill deliberately, and perhaps cry out
      'Hulloa?' and then snap at Jonathan for the interposition of a remark. But
      if charged for two days, he would wish to be told whether they were
      demented, those people outside, and scornfully return the bill to
      Jonathan.
    
    
      A slap on the shoulder, and a voice: 'Found you at last, Tom!' violently
      shattered the excellent plot, and made the old gentleman start. He beheld
      Mr. Andrew Cogglesby.
    
    
      'Drinking Port, Tom?' said Mr. Andrew. 'I 'll join you': and he sat down
      opposite to him, rubbing his hands and pushing back his hair.
    
    
      Jonathan entering briskly with the bill, fell back a step, in alarm. The
      old gentleman, whose inviolacy was thus rudely assailed, sat staring at
      the intruder, his mouth compressed, and three fingers round his glass,
      which it' was doubtful whether he was not going to hurl at him.
    
    
      'Waiter!' Mr. Andrew carelessly hailed, 'a pint of this Port, if you
      please.'
    
    
      Jonathan sought the countenance of the old gentleman.
    
    
      'Do you hear, sir?' cried the latter, turning his wrath on him. 'Another
      pint!' He added: 'Take back the bill'; and away went Jonathan to relate
      fresh marvels to his mistress.
    
    
      Mr. Andrew then addressed the old gentleman in the most audacious manner.
    
    
      'Astonished to see me here, Tom? Dare say you are. I knew you came
      somewhere in this neighbourhood, and, as I wanted to speak to you very
      particularly, and you wouldn't be visible till Monday, why, I spied into
      two or three places, and here I am.'
    
    
      You might see they were brothers. They had the same bushy eyebrows, the
      same healthy colour in their cheeks, the same thick shoulders, and brisk
      way of speaking, and clear, sharp, though kindly, eyes; only Tom was cast
      in larger proportions than Andrew, and had gotten the grey furniture of
      Time for his natural wear. Perhaps, too, a cross in early life had a
      little twisted him, and set his mouth in a rueful bunch, out of which
      occasionally came biting things. Mr. Andrew carried his head up, and eyed
      every man living with the benevolence of a patriarch, dashed with the
      impudence of a London sparrow. Tom had a nagging air, and a trifle of
      acridity on his broad features. Still, any one at a glance could have
      sworn they were brothers, and Jonathan unhesitatingly proclaimed it at the
      Aurora bar.
    
    
      Mr. Andrew's hands were working together, and at them, and at his face,
      the old gentleman continued to look with a firmly interrogating air.
    
    
      'Want to know what brings me, Tom? I'll tell you presently. Hot,       isn't
      it?'
    
    
      'What the deuce are you taking exercise for?' the old gentleman burst out,
      and having unlocked his mouth, he began to puff and alter his posture.
    
    
      'There you are, thawed in a minute!' said Mr. Andrew. 'What's an
      eccentric? a child grown grey. It isn't mine; I read it somewhere. Ah,
      here's the Port! good, I'll warrant.'
    
    
      Jonathan deferentially uncorked, excessive composure on his visage. He
      arranged the table-cloth to a nicety, fixed the bottle with exactness, and
      was only sent scudding by the old gentleman's muttering of: 'Eavesdropping
      pie!' followed by a short, 'Go!' and even then he must delay to sweep off
      a particular crumb.
    
    
      'Good it is!' said Mr. Andrew, rolling the flavour on his lips, as he put
      down his glass. 'I follow you in Port, Tom. Elder brother!'
    
    
      The old gentleman also drank, and was mollified enough to reply: 'Shan't
      follow you in Parliament.'
    
    
      'Haven't forgiven that yet, Tom?'
    
    
      'No great harm done when you're silent.'
    
    
      'Capital Port!' said Mr. Andrew, replenishing the glasses. 'I ought to
      have inquired where they kept the best Port. I might have known you'd
      stick by it. By the way, talking of Parliament, there's talk of a new
      election for Fallow field. You have a vote there. Will you give it to
      Jocelyn? There's talk of his standing.
    
    
      'If he'll wear petticoats, I'll give him my vote.'
    
    
      'There you go, Tom!'
    
    
      'I hate masquerades. You're penny trumpets of the women. That tattle comes
      from the bed-curtains. When a petticoat steps forward I give it my vote,
      or else I button it up in my pocket.'
    
    
      This was probably one of the longest speeches he had ever delivered at the
      Aurora. There was extra Port in it. Jonathan, who from his place of
      observation noted the length of time it occupied, though he was unable to
      gather the context, glanced at Mr. Andrew with a sly satisfaction. Mr.
      Andrew, laughing, signalled for another pint.
    
    
      'So you've come here for my vote, have you?' said Mr. Tom.
    
    
      'Why, no; not exactly that,' Mr. Andrew answered, blinking and passing it
      by.
    
    
      Jonathan brought the fresh pint, and Tom filled for himself, drank, and
      said emphatically, and with a confounding voice:
    
    
      'Your women have been setting you on me, sir!'
    
    
      Andrew protested that he was entirely mistaken.
    
    
      'You're the puppet of your women!'
    
    
      'Well, Tom, not in this instance. Here's to the bachelors, and brother Tom
      at their head!'
    
    
      It seemed to be Andrew's object to help his companion to carry a certain
      quantity of Port, as if he knew a virtue it had to subdue him, and to have
      fixed on a particular measure that he should hold before he addressed him
      specially. Arrived at this, he said:
    
    
      'Look here, Tom. I know your ways. I shouldn't have bothered you here; I
      never have before; but we couldn't very well talk it over in business
      hours; and besides you're never at the Brewery till Monday, and the
      matter's rather urgent.'
    
    
      'Why don't you speak like that in Parliament?' the old man interposed.
    
    
      'Because Parliament isn't my brother,' replied Mr. Andrew. 'You know, Tom,
      you never quite took to my wife's family.'
    
    
      'I'm not a match for fine ladies, Nan.'
    
    
      'Well, Harriet would have taken to you, Tom, and will now, if you 'll let
      her. Of course, it 's a pity if she 's ashamed of       hem! You found it
      out about the Lymport people, Tom, and, you've kept the secret and
      respected her feelings, and I thank you for it. Women are odd in those
      things, you know. She mustn't imagine I 've heard a whisper. I believe it
      would kill her.'
    
    
      The old gentleman shook silently.
    
    
      'Do you want me to travel over the kingdom, hawking her for the daughter
      of a marquis?'
    
    
      'Now, don't joke, Tom. I'm serious. Are you not a Radical at heart? Why do
      you make such a set against the poor women? What do we spring from?'
    
    
      'I take off my hat, Nan, when I see a cobbler's stall.'
    
    
      'And I, Tom, don't care a rush who knows it. Homo       something; but we
      never had much schooling. We 've thriven, and should help those we can.
      We've got on in the world...'
    
    
      'Wife come back from Lymport?' sneered Tom.
    
    
      Andrew hurriedly, and with some confusion, explained that she had not been
      able to go, on account of the child.
    
    
      'Account of the child!' his brother repeated, working his chin
      contemptuously. 'Sisters gone?'
    
    
      'They're stopping with us,' said Andrew, reddening.
    
    
      'So the tailor was left to the kites and the crows. Ah! hum!' and Tom
      chuckled.
    
    
      'You're angry with me, Tom, for coming here,' said Andrew. 'I see what it
      is. Thought how it would be! You're offended, old Tom.'
    
    
      'Come where you like,' returned Tom, 'the place is open. It's a fool that
      hopes for peace anywhere. They sent a woman here to wait on me, this day
      month.'
    
    
      'That's a shame!' said Mr. Andrew, propitiatingly. 'Well, never mind, Tom:
      the women are sometimes in the way.       Evan went down to bury his
      father. He's there now. You wouldn't see him when he was at the Brewery,
      Tom. He's       upon my honour! he's a good young fellow.'
    
    
      'A fine young gentleman, I've no doubt, Nan.'
    
    
      'A really good lad, Tom. No nonsense. I've come here to speak to you about
      him.'
    
    
      Mr. Andrew drew a letter from his pocket, pursuing: 'Just throw aside your
      prejudices, and read this. It's a letter I had from him this morning. But
      first I must tell you how the case stands.'
    
    
      'Know more than you can tell me, Nan,' said Tom, turning over the flavour
      of a gulp of his wine.
    
    
      'Well, then, just let me repeat it. He has been capitally educated; he has
      always been used to good society: well, we mustn't sneer at it: good
      society's better than bad, you'll allow. He has refined tastes: well, you
      wouldn't like to live among crossing-sweepers, Tom. He 's clever and
      accomplished, can speak and write in three languages: I wish I had his
      abilities. He has good manners: well, Tom, you know you like them as well
      as anybody. And now       but read for yourself.'
    
    
      'Yah!' went old Tom. 'The women have been playing the fool with him since
      he was a baby. I read his rigmarole? No.'
    
    
      Mr. Andrew shrugged his shoulders, and opened the letter, saying: 'Well,
      listen'; and then he coughed, and rapidly skimmed the introductory part.
      'Excuses himself for addressing me formally       poor boy! Circumstances
      have altered his position towards the world found his father's affairs in
      a bad state: only chance of paying off father's debts to undertake
      management of business, and bind himself to so much a year. But there,
      Tom, if you won't read it, you miss the poor young fellow's character. He
      says that he has forgotten his station: fancied he was superior to trade,
      but hates debt; and will not allow anybody to throw dirt at his father's
      name, while he can work to clear it; and will sacrifice his pride. Come,
      Tom, that's manly, isn't it? I call it touching, poor lad!'
    
    
      Manly it may have been, but the touching part of it was a feature missed
      in Mr. Andrew's hands. At any rate, it did not appear favourably to
      impress Tom, whose chin had gathered its ominous puckers, as he inquired:
    
    
      'What's the trade? he don't say.'
    
    
      Andrew added, with a wave of the hand: 'Out of a sort of feeling for his
      sisters       I like him for it. Now what I want to ask you, Tom, is,
      whether we can't assist him in some way! Why couldn't we take him into our
      office, and fix him there, eh? If he works well       we're both getting
      old, and my brats are chicks       we might, by-and-by, give him a share.'
    
    
      'Make a brewer of him? Ha! there'd be another mighty sacrifice for his
      pride!'
    
    
      'Come, come, Tom,' said Andrew, 'he's my wife's brother, and I'm yours;
      and       there, you know what women are. They like to preserve
      appearances: we ought to consider them.'
    
    
      'Preserve appearances!' echoed Tom: 'ha! who'll do that for them better
      than a tailor?'
    
    
      Andrew was an impatient little man, fitter for a kind action than to plead
      a cause. Jeering jarred on him; and from the moment his brother began it,
      he was of small service to Evan. He flung back against the partition of
      the compound, rattling it to the disturbance of many a quiet digestion.
    
    
      'Tom,' he cried, 'I believe you're a screw!'
    
    
      'Never said I wasn't,' rejoined Tom, as he finished his glass. 'I 'm a
      bachelor, and a person       you're married, and an object. I won't have
      the tailor's family at my coat-tails.'
    
    
      Do you mean to say, Tom, you don't like the young fellow? The Countess
      says he's half engaged to an heiress; and he has a chance of appointments       of
      course, nothing may come of them. But do you mean to say, you don't like
      him for what he has done?'
    
    
      Tom made his jaw disagreeably prominent. ''Fraid I'm guilty of that
      crime.'
    
    
      'And you that swear at people pretending to be above their station!'
      exclaimed Andrew. 'I shall get in a passion. I can't stand this. Here,
      waiter! what have I to pay?'
    
    
      'Go,' cried the time-honoured guest of the Aurora to Jonathan advancing.
    
    
      Andrew pressed the very roots of his hair back from his red forehead, and
      sat upright and resolute, glancing at Tom. And now ensued a curious scene
      of family blood. For no sooner did elderly Tom observe this bantam-like
      demeanour of his brother, than he ruffled his feathers likewise, and
      looked down on him, agitating his wig over a prodigious frown. Whereof
      came the following sharp colloquy; Andrew beginning:
    
    
      I 'll pay off the debts out of my own pocket.'
    
    
      'You can make a greater fool of yourself, then?'
    
    
      'He shan't be a tailor!'
    
    
      'He shan't be a brewer!'
    
    
      'I say he shall live like a gentleman!'
    
    
      'I say he shall squat like a Turk!'
    
    
      Bang went Andrew's hand on the table: 'I 've pledged my word, mind!'
    
    
      Tom made a counter demonstration: 'And I'll have my way!'
    
    
      'Hang it! I can be as eccentric as you,' said Andrew.
    
    
      'And I as much a donkey as you, if I try hard,' said Tom.
    
    
      Something of the cobbler's stall followed this; till waxing furious, Tom
      sung out to Jonathan, hovering around them in watchful timidity, 'More
      Port!' and the words immediately fell oily on the wrath of the brothers;
      both commenced wiping their heads with their handkerchiefs the faces of
      both emerged and met, with a half-laugh: and, severally determined to keep
      to what they had spoken, there was a tacit accord between them to drop the
      subject.
    
    
      Like sunshine after smart rain, the Port shone on these brothers. Like a
      voice from the pastures after the bellowing of the thunder, Andrew's voice
      asked: 'Got rid of that twinge of the gout, Tom? Did you rub in that
      ointment?' while Tom replied: 'Ay. How about that rheumatism of yours?
      Have you tried that Indy oil?' receiving a like assurance.
    
    
      The remainder of the Port ebbed in meditation and chance remarks. The bit
      of storm had done them both good; and Tom especially       the cynical,
      carping, grim old gentleman       was much improved by the nearer
      resemblance of his manner to Andrew's.
    
    
      Behind this unaffected fraternal concord, however, the fact that they were
      pledged to a race in eccentricity, was present. They had been rivals
      before; and anterior to the date of his marriage, Andrew had done odd
      eclipsing things. But Andrew required prompting to it; he required to be
      put upon his mettle. Whereas, it was more nature with Tom: nature and the
      absence of a wife, gave him advantages over Andrew. Besides, he had his
      character to maintain. He had said the word: and the first vanity of your
      born eccentric is, that he shall be taken for infallible.
    
    
      Presently Andrew ducked his head to mark the evening clouds flushing over
      the court-yard of the Aurora.
    
    
      'Time to be off, Tom,' he said: 'wife at home.'
    
    
      'Ah!' Tom answered. 'Well, I haven't got to go to bed so early.'
    
    
      'What an old rogue you are, Tom!' Andrew pushed his elbows forward on the
      table amiably. 'Gad, we haven't drunk wine together since       by George!
      we'll have another pint.'
    
    
      'Many as you like,' said Tom.
    
    
      Over the succeeding pint, Andrew, in whose veins the Port was merry,
      favoured his brother with an imitation of Major Strike, and indicated his
      dislike to that officer. Tom informed him that Major Strike was
      speculating.
    
    
      'The ass eats at my table, and treats me with contempt.'
    
    
      'Just tell him that you're putting by the bones for him. He 'll want 'em.'
    
    
      Then Andrew with another glance at the clouds, now violet on a grey sky,
      said he must really be off. Upon which Tom observed: 'Don't come here
      again.'
    
    
      'You old rascal, Tom!' cried Andrew, swinging over the table: 'it's quite
      jolly for us to be hob-a-nobbing together once more. 'Gad!       no, we
      won't though! I promised       Harriet. Eh? What say, Tom?'
    
    
      'Nother pint, Nan?'
    
    
      Tom shook his head in a roguishly-cosy, irresistible way. Andrew, from a
      shake of denial and resolve, fell into the same; and there sat the two
      brothers       a jolly picture.
    
    
      The hour was ten, when Andrew Cogglesby, comforted by Tom's remark, that
      he, Tom, had a wig, and that he, Andrew, would have a wigging, left the
      Aurora; and he left it singing a song. Tom Cogglesby still sat at his
      table, holding before him Evan's letter, of which he had got possession;
      and knocking it round and round with a stroke of the forefinger, to the
      tune of, 'Tinker, tailor, soldier, sailor, 'pothecary, ploughboy, thief';
      each profession being sounded as a corner presented itself to the point of
      his nail. After indulging in this species of incantation for some length
      of time, Tom Cogglesby read the letter from beginning to end, and called
      peremptorily for pen, ink, and paper.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER IX. THE COUNTESS IN LOW SOCIETY
    
    
      By dint of stratagems worthy of a Court intrigue, the Countess de Saldar
      contrived to traverse the streets of Lymport, and enter the house where
      she was born, unsuspected and unseen, under cover of a profusion of lace
      and veil and mantilla, which only her heroic resolve to keep her beauties
      hidden from the profane townspeople could have rendered endurable beneath
      the fervid summer sun. Dress in a foreign style she must, as without it
      she lost that sense of superiority, which was the only comfort to her in
      her tribulations. The period of her arrival was ten days subsequent to the
      burial of her father. She had come in the coach, like any common mortal,
      and the coachman, upon her request, had put her down at the Governor's
      house, and the guard had knocked at the door, and the servant had informed
      her that General Hucklebridge was not the governor of Lymport, nor did
      Admiral Combleman then reside in the town; which tidings, the coach then
      being out of sight, it did not disconcert the Countess to hear; and she
      reached her mother, having, at least, cut off communication with the
      object of conveyance.
    
    
      The Countess kissed her mother, kissed Mrs. Fiske, and asked sharply for
      Evan. Mrs. Fiske let her know that Evan was in the house.
    
    
      'Where?' inquired the Countess. 'I have news of the utmost importance for
      him. I must see him.'
    
    
      'Where is he, aunt?' said Mrs. Fiske. 'In the shop, I think; I wonder he
      did not see you passing, Louisa.'
    
    
      The Countess went bolt down into a chair.
    
    
      'Go to him, Jane,' said Mrs. Mel. 'Tell him Louisa is here, and don't
      return.'
    
    
      Mrs. Fiske departed, and the Countess smiled.
    
    
      'Thank you, Mama! you know I never could bear that odious, vulgar little
      woman. Oh, the heat! You talk of Portugal! And, oh! poor dear Papa! what I
      have suffered!'
    
    
      Flapping her laces for air, and wiping her eyes for sorrow, the Countess
      poured a flood of sympathy into her mother's ears and then said:
    
    
      'But you have made a great mistake, Mama, in allowing Evan to put his foot
      into that place. He       beloved of an heiress! Why, if an enemy should
      hear of it, it would ruin him       positively blast him       for ever.
      And that she loves him I have proof positive. Yes; with all her frankness,
      the little thing cannot conceal that from me now. She loves him! And I
      desire you to guess, Mama, whether rivals will not abound? And what enemy
      so much to be dreaded as a rival? And what revelation so awful as that he
      has stood in a       in a       boutique?'
    
    
      Mrs. Mel maintained her usual attitude for listening. It had occurred to
      her that it might do no good to tell the grand lady, her daughter; of
      Evan's resolution, so she simply said, 'It is discipline for him,' and
      left her to speak a private word with the youth.
    
    
      Timidly the Countess inspected the furniture of the apartment, taking
      chills at the dingy articles she saw, in the midst of her heat. That she
      should have sprung from this! The thought was painful; still she could
      forgive Providence so much. But should it ever be known she had sprung
      from this! Alas! she felt she never could pardon such a dire betrayal. She
      had come in good spirits, but the mention of Evan's backsliding had
      troubled her extremely, and though she did not say to herself, What was
      the benefit resulting from her father's dying, if Evan would be so
      base-minded? she thought the thing indefinitely, and was forming the words
      on her mouth, One Harrington in a shop is equal to all! when Evan appeared
      alone.
    
    
      'Why, goodness gracious! where's your moustache?' cried the Countess.
    
    
      'Gone the way of hair!' said Evan, coldly stooping to her forehead.
    
    
      'Such a distinction!' the Countess continued, reproachfully. 'Why, mon
      Dieu! one could hardly tell you; as you look now, from the very commonest
      tradesman       if you were not rather handsome and something of a figure.
      It's a disguise, Evan       do you know that?'
    
    
      'And I 've parted with it       that 's all,' said Evan. 'No more
      disguises for me!'
    
    
      The Countess immediately took his arm, and walked with him to a window.
      His face was certainly changed. Murmuring that the air of Lymport was bad
      for him, and that he must leave it instantly, she bade him sit and attend
      to what she was about to say.
    
    
      While you have been here, degenerating, Evan, day by day       as you
      always do out of my sight       degenerating! no less a word!       I have
      been slaving in your interests. Yes; I have forced the Jocelyns socially
      to acknowledge us. I have not slept; I have eaten bare morsels. Do
      abstinence and vigils clear the wits? I know not! but indeed they have
      enabled me to do more in a week than would suffice for a lifetime. Hark to
      me. I have discovered Rose's secret. Si! It is so! Rose loves you. You
      blush; you blush like a girl. She loves you, and you have let yourself be
      seen in a shop! Contrast me the two things. Oh! in verity, dreadful as it
      is, one could almost laugh. But the moment I lose sight of you, my
      instructions vanish as quickly as that hair on your superior lip, which
      took such time to perfect. Alas! you must grow it again immediately. Use
      any perfumer's contrivance. Rowland! I have great faith in Rowland.
      Without him, I believe, there would have been many bald women committing
      suicide! You remember the bottle I gave to the Count de Villa Flor?
      "Countess," he said to me, "you have saved this egg-shell from a crack by
      helping to cover it"       for so he called his head       the top, you
      know, was beginning to shine like an egg. And I do fear me he would have
      done it. Ah! you do not conceive what the dread of baldness is! To a woman
      death       death is preferable to baldness! Baldness is death! And a wig       a
      wig! Oh, horror! total extinction is better than to rise again in a wig!
      But you are young, and play with hair. But I was saying, I went to see the
      Jocelyns. I was introduced to Sir Franks and his lady and the wealthy
      grandmother. And I have an invitation for you, Evan       you unmannered
      boy, that you do not bow! A gentle incline forward of the shoulders, and
      the eyes fixed softly, your upper lids drooping triflingly, as if you
      thanked with gentle sincerity, but were indifferent. Well, well, if you
      will not! An invitation for you to spend part of the autumn at Beckley
      Court, the ancestral domain, where there will be company the nobles of the
      land! Consider that. You say it was bold in me to face them after that
      horrible man committed us on board the vessel? A Harrington is anything
      but a coward. I did go and because I am devoted to your interests. That
      very morning, I saw announced in the paper, just beneath poor Andrew's
      hand, as he held it up at the breakfast-table, reading it, I saw among the
      deaths, Sir Abraham Harrington, of Torquay, Baronet, of quinsy! Twice that
      good man has come to my rescue! Oh! I welcomed him as a piece of
      Providence! I turned and said to Harriet, "I see they have put poor Papa
      in the paper." Harriet was staggered. I took the paper from Andrew, and
      pointed it to her. She has no readiness. She has had no foreign training.
      She could not comprehend, and Andrew stood on tiptoe, and peeped. He has a
      bad cough, and coughed himself black in the face. I attribute it to
      excessive bad manners and his cold feelings. He left the room. I
      reproached Harriet. But, oh! the singularity of the excellent fortune of
      such an event at such a time! It showed that our Harrington-luck had not
      forsaken us. I hurried to the Jocelyns instantly. Of course, it cleared
      away any suspicions aroused in them by that horrible man on board the
      vessel. And the tears I wept for Sir Abraham, Evan, in verity they were
      tears of deep and sincere gratitude! What is your mouth knitting the
      corners at? Are you laughing?'
    
    
      Evan hastily composed his visage to the melancholy that was no counterfeit
      in him just then.
    
    
      'Yes,' continued the Countess, easily reassured, 'I shall ever feel a debt
      to Sir Abraham Harrington, of Torquay. I dare say we are related to him.
      At least he has done us more service than many a rich and titled relative.
      No one supposes he would acknowledge poor Papa. I can forgive him that,
      Evan!' The Countess pointed out her finger with mournful and impressive
      majesty, 'As we look down on that monkey, people of rank and consideration
      in society look on what poor dear Papa was.'
    
    
      This was partly true, for Jacko sat on a chair, in his favourite attitude,
      copied accurately from the workmen of the establishment at their labour
      with needle and thread. Growing cognizant of the infamy of his posture,
      the Countess begged Evan to drive him out of her sight, and took a sniff
      at her smelling-bottle.
    
    
      She went on: 'Now, dear Van, you would hear of your sweet Rose?'
    
    
      'Not a word!' Evan hastily answered.
    
    
      'Why, what does this indicate? Whims! Then you do love?'
    
    
      'I tell you, Louisa, I don't want to hear a word of any of them,' said
      Evan, with an angry gleam in his eyes. 'They are nothing to me, nor I to
      them. I       my walk in life is not theirs.'
    
    
      'Faint heart! faint heart!' the Countess lifted a proverbial forefinger.
    
    
      'Thank heaven, I shall have the consolation of not going about, and bowing
      and smirking like an impostor!' Evan exclaimed.
    
    
      There was a wider intelligence in the Countess's arrested gaze than she
      chose to fashion into speech.
    
    
      'I knew,' she said, 'I knew how the air of this horrible Lymport would act
      on you. But while I live, Evan, you shall not sink in the sludge. You,
      with all the pains I have lavished on you! and with your presence!       for
      you have a presence, so rare among young men in this England! You, who
      have been to a Court, and interchanged bows with duchesses, and I know not
      what besides       nay, I do not accuse you; but if you had not been a
      mere boy, and an English boy-poor Eugenia herself confessed to me that you
      had a look       a tender cleaving of the underlids       that made her
      catch her hand to her heart sometimes: it reminded her so acutely of false
      Belmarafa. Could you have had a greater compliment than that? You shall
      not stop here another day!'
    
    
      'True,' said Evan, 'for I'm going to London to-night.'
    
    
      'Not to London,' the Countess returned, with a conquering glance, 'but to
      Beckley Court-and with me.'
    
    
      'To London, Louisa, with Mr. Goren.'
    
    
      Again the Countess eyed him largely; but took, as it were, a side-path
      from her broad thought, saying: 'Yes, fortunes are made in London, if you
      would they should be rapid.'
    
    
      She meditated. At that moment Dandy knocked at the door, and called
      outside: 'Please, master, Mr. Goren says there's a gentleman in the
      shop-wants to see you.'
    
    
      'Very well,' replied Evan, moving. He was swung violently round.
    
    
      The Countess had clutched him by the arm. A fearful expression was on her
      face.
    
    
      'Whither do you go?' she said.
    
    
      'To the shop, Louisa.'
    
    
      Too late to arrest the villanous word, she pulled at him. 'Are you quite
      insane? Consent to be seen by a gentleman there? What has come to you? You
      must be lunatic! Are we all to be utterly ruined       disgraced?'
    
    
      'Is my mother to starve?' said Evan.
    
    
      'Absurd rejoinder! No! You should have sold everything here before this.
      She can live with Harriet       she       once out of this horrible
      element       she would not show it. But, Evan, you are getting away from
      me: you are not going?       speak!'
    
    
      'I am going,' said Evan.
    
    
      The Countess clung to him, exclaiming: 'Never, while I have the power to
      detain you!' but as he was firm and strong, she had recourse to her
      woman's aids, and burst into a storm of sobs on his shoulder       a scene
      of which Mrs. Mel was, for some seconds, a composed spectator.
    
    
      'What 's the matter now?' said Mrs. Mel.
    
    
      Evan impatiently explained the case. Mrs. Mel desired her daughter to
      avoid being ridiculous, and making two fools in her family; and at the
      same time that she told Evan there was no occasion for him to go,
      contrived, with a look, to make the advice a command. He, in that state of
      mind when one takes bitter delight in doing an abhorred duty, was hardly
      willing to be submissive; but the despair of the Countess reduced him, and
      for her sake he consented to forego the sacrifice of his pride which was
      now his sad, sole pleasure. Feeling him linger, the Countess relaxed her
      grasp. Hers were tears that dried as soon as they had served their end;
      and, to give him the full benefit of his conduct, she said: 'I knew Evan
      would be persuaded by me.'
    
    
      Evan pitifully pressed her hand, and sighed.
    
    
      'Tea is on the table down-stairs,' said Mrs. Mel. 'I have cooked something
      for you, Louisa. Do you sleep here to-night?'
    
    
      'Can I tell you, Mama?' murmured the Countess. 'I am dependent on our
      Evan.'
    
    
      'Oh! well, we will eat first,' said Mrs. Mel, and they went to the table
      below, the Countess begging her mother to drop titles in designating her
      to the servants, which caused Mrs. Mel to say:
    
    
      'There is but one. I do the cooking'; and the Countess, ever disposed to
      flatter and be suave, even when stung by a fact or a phrase, added:
    
    
      'And a beautiful cook you used to be, dear Mama!'
    
    
      At the table, awaiting them, sat Mrs. Wishaw, Mrs. Fiske, and Mr. Goren,
      who soon found themselves enveloped in the Countess's graciousness. Mr.
      Goren would talk of trade, and compare Lymport business with London, and
      the Countess, loftily interested in his remarks, drew him out to disgust
      her brother. Mrs. Wishaw, in whom the Countess at once discovered a
      frivolous pretentious woman of the moneyed trading class, she treated as
      one who was alive to society, and surveyed matters from a station in the
      world, leading her to think that she tolerated Mr. Goren, as a
      lady-Christian of the highest rank should tolerate the insects that toil
      for us. Mrs. Fiske was not so tractable, for Mrs. Fiske was hostile and
      armed. Mrs. Fiske adored the great Mel, and she had never loved Louisa.
      Hence, she scorned Louisa on account of her late behaviour toward her dead
      parent. The Countess saw through her, and laboured to be friendly with
      her, while she rendered her disagreeable in the eyes of Mrs. Wishaw, and
      let Mrs. Wishaw perceive that sympathy was possible between them;
      manoeuvring a trifle too delicate, perhaps, for the people present, but
      sufficient to blind its keen-witted author to the something that was being
      concealed from herself, of which something, nevertheless, her senses
      apprehensively warned her: and they might have spoken to her wits, but
      that mortals cannot, unaided, guess, or will not, unless struck in the
      face by the fact, credit, what is to their minds the last horror.
    
    
      'I came down in the coach, quite accidental, with this gentleman,' said
      Mrs. Wishaw, fanning a cheek and nodding at Mr. Goren. 'I'm an old flame
      of dear Mel's. I knew him when he was an apprentice in London. Now, wasn't
      it odd? Your mother       I suppose I must call you "my lady"?'
    
    
      The Countess breathed a tender 'Spare me,' with a smile that added, 'among
      friends!'
    
    
      Mrs. Wishaw resumed: 'Your mother was an old flame of this gentleman's, I
      found out. So there were two old flames, and I couldn't help thinking! But
      I was so glad to have seen dear Mel once more:
    
    
      'Ah!' sighed the Countess.
    
    
      'He was always a martial-looking man, and laid out, he was quite imposing.
      I declare, I cried so, as it reminded me of when I couldn't have him, for
      he had nothing but his legs and arms       and I married Wishaw. But it's
      a comfort to think I have been of some service to dear, dear Mel! for
      Wishaw 's a man of accounts and payments; and I knew Mel had cloth from
      him, and, the lady suggested bills delayed, with two or three nods, 'you
      know! and I'll do my best for his son.'
    
    
      'You are kind,' said the Countess, smiling internally at the vulgar
      creature's misconception of Evan's requirements.
    
    
      'Did he ever talk much about Mary Fence?' asked Mrs. Wishaw. '"Polly
      Fence," he used to say, "sweet Polly Fence!"'
    
    
      'Oh! I think so. Frequently,' observed the Countess.
    
    
      Mrs. Fiske primmed her mouth. She had never heard the great Mel allude to
      the name of Fence.
    
    
      The Goren-croak was heard
    
    
      'Painters have painted out "Melchisedec" this afternoon. Yes,       ah! In
      and out-as the saying goes.'
    
    
      Here was an opportunity to mortify the Countess.
    
    
      Mrs. Fiske placidly remarked: 'Have we the other put up in its stead? It
      's shorter.'
    
    
      A twinge of weakness had made Evan request that the name of Evan
      Harrington should not decorate the shopfront till he had turned his back
      on it, for a time. Mrs. Mel crushed her venomous niece.
    
    
      'What have you to do with such things? Shine in your own affairs first,
      Ann, before you meddle with others.'
    
    
      Relieved at hearing that 'Melchisedec' was painted out, and unsuspicious
      of the announcement that should replace it, the Countess asked Mrs. Wishaw
      if she thought Evan like her dear Papa.
    
    
      'So like,' returned the lady, 'that I would not be alone with him yet, for
      worlds. I should expect him to be making love to me: for, you know, my
      dear       I must be familiar       Mel never could be alone with you,
      without! It was his nature. I speak of him before marriage. But, if I can
      trust myself with him, I shall take charge of Mr. Evan, and show him some
      London society.'
    
    
      'That is indeed kind,' said the Countess, glad of a thick veil for the
      utterance of her contempt. 'Evan, though       I fear       will be rather
      engaged. His friends, the Jocelyns of Beckley Court, will       I fear       hardly
      dispense with him and Lady Splenders       you know her? the Marchioness
      of Splenders? No?       by repute, at least: a most beautiful and most
      fascinating woman; report of him alone has induced her to say that Evan
      must and shall form a part of her autumnal gathering at Splenders Castle.
      And how he is to get out of it, I cannot tell. But I am sure his
      multitudinous engagements will not prevent his paying due court to
      Mistress Wishaw.'
    
    
      As the Countess intended, Mistress Wishaw's vanity was reproved, and her
      ambition excited: a pretty doublestroke, only possible to dexterous
      players.
    
    
      The lady rejoined that she hoped so, she was sure; and forthwith (because
      she suddenly seemed to possess him more than his son), launched upon Mel's
      incomparable personal attractions. This caused the Countess to enlarge
      upon Evan's vast personal prospects. They talked across each other a
      little, till the Countess remembered her breeding, allowed Mrs. Wishaw to
      run to an end in hollow exclamations, and put a finish to the undeclared
      controversy, by a traverse of speech, as if she were taking up the most
      important subject of their late colloquy. 'But Evan is not in his own
      hands       he is in the hands of a lovely young woman, I must tell you.
      He belongs to her, and not to us. You have heard of Rose Jocelyn, the
      celebrated heiress?'
    
    
      'Engaged?' Mrs. Wishaw whispered aloud.
    
    
      The Countess, an adept in the lie implied       practised by her, that she
      might not subject herself to future punishment (in which she was so devout
      a believer, that she condemned whole hosts to it)       deeply smiled.
    
    
      'Really!' said Mrs. Wishaw, and was about to inquire why Evan, with these
      brilliant expectations, could think of trade and tailoring, when the young
      man, whose forehead had been growing black, jumped up, and quitted them;
      thus breaking the harmony of the table; and as the Countess had said
      enough, she turned the conversation to the always welcome theme of low
      society. She broached death and corpses; and became extremely interesting,
      and very sympathetic: the only difference between the ghostly anecdotes
      she related, and those of the other ladies, being that her ghosts were all
      of them titled, and walked mostly under the burden of a coronet. For
      instance, there was the Portuguese Marquis de Col. He had married a
      Spanish wife, whose end was mysterious. Undressing, on the night of the
      anniversary of her death, and on the point of getting into bed, he beheld
      the dead woman lying on her back before him. All night long he had to
      sleep with this freezing phantom! Regularly, every fresh anniversary, he
      had to endure the same penance, no matter where he might be, or in what
      strange bed. On one occasion, when he took the live for the dead, a
      curious thing occurred, which the Countess scrupled less to relate than
      would men to hint at. Ghosts were the one childish enjoyment Mrs. Mel
      allowed herself, and she listened to her daughter intently, ready to cap
      any narrative; but Mrs. Fiske stopped the flood.
    
    
      'You have improved on Peter Smithers, Louisa,' she said.
    
    
      The Countess turned to her mildly.
    
    
      'You are certainly thinking of Peter Smithers,' Mrs. Fiske continued,
      bracing her shoulders. 'Surely, you remember poor Peter, Louisa? An old
      flame of your own! He was going to kill himself, but married a Devonshire
      woman, and they had disagreeables, and SHE died, and he was undressing,
      and saw her there in the bed, and wouldn't get into it, and had the
      mattress, and the curtains, and the counterpanes, and everything burnt. He
      told us it himself. You must remember it, Louisa?'
    
    
      The Countess remembered nothing of the sort. No doubt could exist of its
      having been the Portuguese Marquis de Col, because he had confided to her
      the whole affair, and indeed come to her, as his habit was, to ask her
      what he could possibly do, under the circumstances. If Mrs. Fiske's
      friend, who married the Devonshire person, had seen the same thing, the
      coincidence was yet more extraordinary than the case. Mrs. Fiske said it
      assuredly was, and glanced at her aunt, who, as the Countess now rose,
      declaring she must speak to Evan, chid Mrs. Fiske, and wished her and
      Peter Smithers at the bottom of the sea.
    
    
      'No, no, Mama,' said the Countess, laughing, 'that would hardly be
      proper,' and before Mrs. Fiske could reply, escaped to complain to Evan of
      the vulgarity of those women.
    
    
      She was not prepared for the burst of wrath with which Evan met her.
      'Louisa,' said he, taking her wrist sternly, 'you have done a thing I
      can't forgive. I find it hard to bear disgrace myself: I will not consent
      to bring it upon others. Why did you dare to couple Miss Jocelyn's name
      with mine?'
    
    
      The Countess gave him out her arm's length. 'Speak on, Van,' she said,
      admiring him with a bright gaze.
    
    
      'Answer me, Louisa; and don't take me for a fool any more,' he pursued.
      'You have coupled Miss Jocelyn's name with mine, in company, and I insist
      now upon your giving me your promise to abstain from doing it anywhere,
      before anybody.'
    
    
      'If she saw you at this instant, Van,' returned the incorrigible Countess,
      'would she desire it, think you? Oh! I must make you angry before her, I
      see that! You have your father's frown. You surpass him, for your delivery
      is more correct, and equally fluent. And if a woman is momentarily melted
      by softness in a man, she is for ever subdued by boldness and bravery of
      mien.'
    
    
      Evan dropped her hand. 'Miss Jocelyn has done me the honour to call me her
      friend. That was in other days.' His lip quivered. 'I shall not see Miss
      Jocelyn again. Yes; I would lay down my life for her; but that's idle
      talk. No such chance will ever come to me. But I can save her from being
      spoken of in alliance with me, and what I am, and I tell you, Louisa, I
      will not have it.' Saying which, and while he looked harshly at her,
      wounded pride bled through his eyes.
    
    
      She was touched. 'Sit down, dear; I must explain to you, and make you
      happy against your will,' she said, in another voice, and an English
      accent. 'The mischief is done, Van. If you do not want Rose Jocelyn to
      love you, you must undo it in your own way. I am not easily deceived. On
      the morning I went to her house in town, she took me aside, and spoke to
      me. Not a confession in words. The blood in her cheeks, when I mentioned
      you, did that for her. Everything about you she must know       how you
      bore your grief, and all. And not in her usual free manner, but timidly,
      as if she feared a surprise, or feared to be wakened to the secret in her
      bosom she half suspects       "Tell him!" she said, "I hope he will not
      forget me."'
    
    
      The Countess was interrupted by a great sob; for the picture of frank Rose
      Jocelyn changed, and soft, and, as it were, shadowed under a veil of
      bashful regard for him, so filled the young man with sorrowful tenderness,
      that he trembled, and was as a child.
    
    
      Marking the impression she had produced on him, and having worn off that
      which he had produced on her, the Countess resumed the art in her style of
      speech, easier to her than nature.
    
    
      'So the sweetest of Roses may be yours, dear Van; and you have her in a
      gold setting, to wear on your heart. Are you not enviable? I will not       no,
      I will not tell you she is perfect. I must fashion the sweet young
      creature. Though I am very ready to admit that she is much improved by
      this       shall I call it, desired consummation?'
    
    
      Evan could listen no more. Such a struggle was rising in his breast: the
      effort to quench what the Countess had so shrewdly kindled; passionate
      desire to look on Rose but for one lightning flash: desire to look on her,
      and muffled sense of shame twin-born with it: wild love and leaden misery
      mixed: dead hopelessness and vivid hope. Up to the neck in Purgatory, but
      his soul saturated with visions of Bliss! The fair orb of Love was all
      that was wanted to complete his planetary state, and aloft it sprang,
      showing many faint, fair tracts to him, and piling huge darknesses.
    
    
      As if in search of something, he suddenly went from the room.
    
    
      'I have intoxicated the poor boy,' said the Countess, and consulted an
      attitude by the evening light in a mirror. Approving the result, she rang
      for her mother, and sat with her till dark; telling her she could not and
      would not leave her dear Mama that night. At the supper-table Evan did not
      appear, and Mr. Goren, after taking counsel of Mrs. Mel, dispersed the
      news that Evan was off to London. On the road again, with a purse just as
      ill-furnished, and in his breast the light that sometimes leads gentlemen,
      as well as ladies, astray.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER X. MY GENTLEMAN ON THE ROAD AGAIN
    
    
      Near a milestone, under the moonlight, crouched the figure of a woman,
      huddled with her head against her knees, and careless hair falling to the
      summer's dust. Evan came upon this sight within a few miles of
      Fallowfield. At first he was rather startled, for he had inherited
      superstitious emotions from his mother, and the road was lone, the moon
      full. He went up to her and spoke a gentle word, which provoked no reply.
      He ventured to put his hand on her shoulder, continuing softly to address
      her. She was flesh and blood. Evan stooped his head to catch a whisper
      from her mouth, but nothing save a heavier fall of the breath she took, as
      of one painfully waking, was heard.
    
    
      A misery beyond our own is a wholesome picture for youth, and though we
      may not for the moment compare the deep with the lower deep, we, if we
      have a heart for outer sorrows, can forget ourselves in it. Evan had just
      been accusing the heavens of conspiracy to disgrace him. Those patient
      heavens had listened, as is their wont. They had viewed and had not been
      disordered by his mental frenzies. It is certainly hard that they do not
      come down to us, and condescend to tell us what they mean, and be
      dumb-foundered by the perspicuity of our arguments the argument, for
      instance, that they have not fashioned us for the science of the shears,
      and do yet impel us to wield them. Nevertheless, they to whom mortal life
      has ceased to be a long matter perceive that our appeals for conviction
      are answered, now and then very closely upon the call. When we have cast
      off the scales of hope and fancy, and surrender our claims on mad chance,
      it is given us to see that some plan is working out: that the heavens, icy
      as they are to the pangs of our blood, have been throughout speaking to
      our souls; and, according to the strength there existing, we learn to
      comprehend them. But their language is an element of Time, whom primarily
      we have to know.
    
    
      Evan Harrington was young. He wished not to clothe the generation. What
      was to the remainder of the exiled sons of Adam simply the brand of
      expulsion from Paradise, was to him hell. In his agony, anything less than
      an angel, soft-voiced in his path, would not have satisfied the poor boy,
      and here was this wretched outcast, and instead of being relieved, he was
      to act the reliever!
    
    
      Striving to rouse the desolate creature, he shook her slightly. She now
      raised her head with a slow, gradual motion, like that of a wax-work,
      showing a white young face, tearless,-dreadfully drawn at the lips. After
      gazing at him, she turned her head mechanically to her shoulder, as to ask
      him why he touched her. He withdrew his hand, saying:
    
    
      'Why are you here? Pardon me; I want, if possible, to help you.'
    
    
      A light sprang in her eyes. She jumped from the stone, and ran forward a
      step or two, with a gasp:
    
    
      'Oh, my God! I want to go and drown myself.'
    
    
      Evan lingered behind her till he saw her body sway, and in a fit of
      trembling she half fell on his outstretched arm. He led her to the stone,
      not knowing what on earth to do with her. There was no sign of a house
      near; they were quite solitary; to all his questions she gave an
      unintelligible moan. He had not the heart to leave her, so, taking a sharp
      seat on a heap of flints, thus possibly furnishing future occupation for
      one of his craftsmen, he waited, and amused himself by marking out
      diagrams with his stick in the thick dust.
    
    
      His thoughts were far away, when he heard, faintly uttered:
    
    
      'Why do you stop here?'
    
    
      'To help you.'
    
    
      'Please don't. Let me be. I can't be helped.'
    
    
      'My good creature,' said Evan, 'it 's quite impossible that I should leave
      you in this state. Tell me where you were going when your illness seized
      you?'
    
    
      'I was going,' she commenced vacantly, 'to the sea       the water,' she
      added, with a shivering lip.
    
    
      The foolish youth asked her if she could be cold on such a night.
    
    
      'No, I'm not cold,' she replied, drawing closer over her lap the ends of a
      shawl which would in that period have been thought rather gaudy for her
      station.
    
    
      'You were going to Lymport?'
    
    
      'Yes,       Lymport's nearest, I think.'
    
    
      'And why were you out travelling at this hour?'
    
    
      She dropped her head, and began rocking to right and left.
    
    
      While they talked the noise of waggon-wheels was heard approaching. Evan
      went into the middle of the road, and beheld a covered waggon, and a
      fellow whom he advanced to meet, plodding a little to the rear of the
      horses. He proved kindly. He was a farmer's man, he said, and was at that
      moment employed in removing the furniture of the farmer's son, who had
      failed as a corn-chandler in Lymport, to Hillford, which he expected to
      reach about morn. He answered Evan's request that he would afford the
      young woman conveyance as far as Fallowfield:
    
    
      'Tak' her in? That I will.
    
    
      'She won't hurt the harses,' he pursued, pointing his whip at the vehicle:
      'there's my mate, Gearge Stoakes, he's in there, snorin' his turn. Can't
      you hear 'n asnorin' thraugh the wheels? I can; I've been laughin'! He do
      snore that loud-Gearge do!'
    
    
      Proceeding to inform Evan how George Stokes had snored in that
      characteristic manner from boyhood, ever since he and George had slept in
      a hayloft together; and how he, kept wakeful and driven to distraction by
      George Stokes' nose, had been occasionally compelled, in sheer
      self-defence, madly to start up and hold that pertinacious alarum in tight
      compression between thumb and forefinger; and how George Stokes, thus
      severely handled, had burst his hold with a tremendous snort, as big as a
      bull, and had invariably uttered the exclamation, 'Hulloa!       same to
      you, my lad!' and rolled over to snore as fresh as ever;       all this
      with singular rustic comparisons, racy of the soil, and in raw Hampshire
      dialect, the waggoner came to a halt opposite the stone, and, while Evan
      strode to assist the girl, addressed himself to the great task of arousing
      the sturdy sleeper and quieting his trumpet, heard by all ears now that
      the accompaniment of the wheels was at an end.
    
    
      George, violently awakened, complained that it was before his time, to
      which he was true; and was for going off again with exalted contentment,
      though his heels had been tugged, and were dangling some length out of the
      machine; but his comrade, with a determined blow of the lungs, gave
      another valiant pull, and George Stokes was on his legs, marvelling at the
      world and man. Evan had less difficulty with the girl. She rose to meet
      him, put up her arms for him to clasp her waist, whispering sharply in an
      inward breath: 'What are you going to do with me?' and indifferent to his
      verbal response, trustingly yielded her limbs to his guidance. He could
      see blood on her bitten underlip; as, with the help of the waggoner, he
      lifted her on the mattress, backed by a portly bundle, which the sagacity
      of Mr. Stokes had selected for his couch.
    
    
      The waggoner cracked his whip, laughing at George Stokes, who yawned and
      settled into a composed ploughswing, without asking questions; apparently
      resolved to finish his nap on his legs.
    
    
      'Warn't he like that Myzepper chap, I see at the circus, bound athert gray
      mare!' chuckled the waggoner. 'So he 'd 'a gone on, had ye 'a let 'n. No
      wulves waddn't wake Gearge till he 'd slept it out. Then he 'd say,
      "marnin'!" to 'm. Are ye 'wake now, Gearge?'
    
    
      The admirable sleeper preferred to be a quiet butt, and the waggoner
      leisurely exhausted the fun that was to be had out of him; returning to it
      with a persistency that evinced more concentration than variety in his
      mind. At last Evan said: 'Your pace is rather slow. They'll be shut up in
      Fallowfield. I 'll go on ahead. You'll find me at one of the inns-the
      Green Dragon.'
    
    
      In return for this speech, the waggoner favoured him with a stare,
      followed by the exclamation:
    
    
      'Oh, no! dang that!'
    
    
      'Why, what's the matter?' quoth Evan.
    
    
      'You en't goin' to be off, for to leave me and Gearge in the lurch there,
      with that ther' young woman, in that ther' pickle!' returned the waggoner.
    
    
      Evan made an appeal to his reason, but finding that impregnable, he pulled
      out his scanty purse to guarantee his sincerity with an offer of
      pledgemoney. The waggoner waved it aside. He wanted no money, he said.
    
    
      'Look heer,' he went on; 'if you're for a start, I tells ye plain, I
      chucks that ther' young woman int' the road.'
    
    
      Evan bade him not to be a brute.
    
    
      'Nark and crop!' the waggoner doggedly ejaculated.
    
    
      Very much surprised that a fellow who appeared sound at heart, should
      threaten to behave so basely, Evan asked an explanation: upon which the
      waggoner demanded to know what he had eyes for: and as this query failed
      to enlighten the youth, he let him understand that he was a man of family
      experience, and that it was easy to tell at a glance that the complaint
      the young woman laboured under was one common to the daughters of Eve. He
      added that, should an emergency arise, he, though a family man, would be
      useless: that he always vacated the premises while those incidental scenes
      were being enacted at home; and that for him and George Stokes to be left
      alone with the young woman, why they would be of no more service to her
      than a couple of babies newborn themselves. He, for his part, he assured
      Evan, should take to his heels, and relinquish waggon, and horses, and
      all; while George probably would stand and gape; and the end of it would
      be, they would all be had up for murder. He diverged from the alarming
      prospect, by a renewal of the foregoing alternative to the gentleman who
      had constituted himself the young woman's protector. If he parted company
      with them, they would immediately part company with the young woman, whose
      condition was evident.
    
    
      'Why, couldn't you tall that?' said the waggoner, as Evan, tingling at the
      ears, remained silent.
    
    
      'I know nothing of such things,' he answered, hastily, like one hurt.
    
    
      I have to repeat the statement, that he was a youth, and a modest one. He
      felt unaccountably, unreasonably, but horridly, ashamed. The thought of
      his actual position swamped the sickening disgust at tailordom. Worse,
      then, might happen to us in this extraordinary world! There was something
      more abhorrent than sitting with one's legs crossed, publicly stitching,
      and scoffed at! He called vehemently to the waggoner to whip the horses,
      and hurry ahead into Fallowfield; but that worthy, whatever might be his
      dire alarms, had a regular pace, that was conscious of no spur: the reply
      of 'All right!' satisfied him at least; and Evan's chaste sighs for the
      appearance of an assistant petticoat round a turn of the road, were
      offered up duly, to the measure of the waggoner's steps.
    
    
      Suddenly the waggoner came to a halt, and said 'Blest if that Gearge
      bain't a snorin' on his pins!'
    
    
      Evan lingered by him with some curiosity, while the waggoner thumped his
      thigh to, 'Yes he be! no he bain't!' several times, in eager hesitation.
    
    
      'It's a fellow calling from the downs,' said Evan.
    
    
      'Ay, so!' responded the waggoner. 'Dang'd if I didn't think 'twere that
      Gearge of our'n. Hark awhile.'
    
    
      At a repetition of the call, the waggoner stopped his team. After a few
      minutes, a man appeared panting on the bank above them, down which he ran
      precipitately, knocked against Evan, apologized with the little breath
      that remained to him, and then held his hand as to entreat a hearing. Evan
      thought him half-mad; the waggoner was about to imagine him the victim of
      a midnight assault. He undeceived them by requesting, in rather flowery
      terms, conveyance on the road and rest for his limbs. It being explained
      to him that the waggon was already occupied, he comforted himself aloud
      with the reflection that it was something to be on the road again for one
      who had been belated, lost, and wandering over the downs for the last six
      hours.
    
    
      'Walcome to git in, when young woman gits out,' said the waggoner. 'I'll
      gi' ye my sleep on t' Hillford.'
    
    
      'Thanks, worthy friend,' returned the new comer. 'The state of the case is
      this       I'm happy to take from humankind whatsoever I can get. If this
      gentleman will accept of my company, and my legs hold out, all will yet be
      well.'
    
    
      Though he did not wear a petticoat, Evan was not sorry to have him. Next
      to the interposition of the Gods, we pray for human fellowship when we are
      in a mess. So he mumbled politely, dropped with him a little to the rear,
      and they all stepped out to the crack of the waggoner's whip.
    
    
      'Rather a slow pace,' said Evan, feeling bound to converse.
    
    
      'Six hours on the downs makes it extremely suitable to me,' rejoined the
      stranger.
    
    
      'You lost your way?'
    
    
      'I did, sir. Yes; one does not court those desolate regions wittingly. I
      am for life and society. The embraces of Diana do not agree with my
      constitution. If classics there be who differ from me, I beg them to take
      six hours on the downs alone with the moon, and the last prospect of bread
      and cheese, and a chaste bed, seemingly utterly extinguished. I am cured
      of my romance. Of course, when I say bread and cheese, I speak
      figuratively. Food is implied.'
    
    
      Evan stole a glance at his companion.
    
    
      'Besides,' the other continued, with an inflexion of grandeur, 'for a man
      accustomed to his hunters, it is, you will confess, unpleasant       I
      speak' hypothetically       to be reduced to his legs to that extent that
      it strikes him shrewdly he will run them into stumps.'
    
    
      The stranger laughed.
    
    
      The fair lady of the night illumined his face, like one who recognized a
      subject. Evan thought he knew the voice. A curious struggle therein
      between native facetiousness and an attempt at dignity, appeared to Evan
      not unfamiliar; and the egregious failure of ambition and triumph of the
      instinct, helped him to join, the stranger in his mirth.
    
    
      'Jack Raikes?' he said: 'surely?'
    
    
      'The man!' it was answered to him. 'But you? and near our old school       Viscount
      Harrington? These marvels occur, you see       we meet again by night.'
    
    
      Evan, with little gratification at the meeting, fell into their former
      comradeship; tickled by a recollection of his old schoolfellow's
      India-rubber mind.
    
    
      Mr. Raikes stood about a head under him. He had extremely mobile features;
      thick, flexible eyebrows; a loose, voluble mouth; a ridiculous figure on a
      dandified foot. He represented to you one who was rehearsing a part he
      wished to act before the world, and was not aware that he took the world
      into his confidence.
    
    
      How he had come there his elastic tongue explained in tropes and puns and
      lines of dramatic verse. His patrimony spent, he at once believed himself
      an actor, and he was hissed off the stage of a provincial theatre.
    
    
      'Ruined, the last ignominy endured, I fled from the gay vistas of the
      Bench       for they live who would thither lead me! and determined, the
      day before the yesterday       what think'st thou? why to go boldly, and
      offer myself as Adlatus to blessed old Cudford! Yes! a little Latin is all
      that remains to me, and I resolved, like the man I am, to turn, hic, hac,
      hoc, into bread and cheese, and beer: Impute nought foreign to me, in the
      matter of pride.'
    
    
      'Usher in our old school       poor old Jack!' exclaimed Evan.
    
    
      'Lieutenant in the Cudford Academy!' the latter rejoined. 'I walked the
      distance from London. I had my interview with the respected principal. He
      gave me of mutton nearest the bone, which, they say, is sweetest; and on
      sweet things you should not regale in excess. Endymion watched the sheep
      that bred that mutton! He gave me the thin beer of our boyhood, that I
      might the more soberly state my mission. That beer, my friend, was brewed
      by one who wished to form a study for pantomimic masks. He listened with
      the gravity which is all his own to the recital of my career; he
      pleasantly compared me to Phaethon, congratulated the river Thames at my
      not setting it on fire in my rapid descent, and extended to me the three
      fingers of affectionate farewell. "You an usher, a rearer of youth, Mr.
      Raikes? Oh, no! Oh, no!" That was all I could get out of him. 'Gad! he
      might have seen that I didn't joke with the mutton-bone. If I winced at
      the beer it was imperceptible. Now a man who can do that is what I call a
      man in earnest.'
    
    
      'You've just come from Cudford?' said Evan.
    
    
      'Short is the tale, though long the way, friend Harrington. From Bodley is
      ten miles to Beckley. I walked them. From Beckley is fifteen miles to
      Fallowfield. Them I was traversing, when, lo! near sweet eventide a fair
      horsewoman riding with her groom at her horse's heels. "Lady," says I,
      addressing her, as much out of the style of the needy as possible, "will
      you condescend to direct me to Fallowfield?"       "Are you going to the
      match?" says she. I answered boldly that I was. "Beckley's in," says she,
      "and you'll be in time to see them out, if you cut across the downs
      there." I lifted my hat       a desperate measure, for the brim won't bear
      much       but honour to women though we perish. She bowed: I cut across
      the downs. In fine, Harrington, old boy, I've been wandering among those
      downs for the last seven or eight hours. I was on the point of turning my
      back on the road for the twentieth time, I believe when I heard your
      welcome vehicular music, and hailed you; and I ask you, isn't it luck for
      a fellow who hasn't got a penny in his pocket, and is as hungry as five
      hundred hunters, to drop on an old friend like this?'
    
    
      Evan answered with the question:
    
    
      'Where was it you said you met the young lady?'
    
    
      'In the first place, O Amadis! I never said she was young. You're on the
      scent, I see.'
    
    
      Nursing the fresh image of his darling in his heart's recesses, Evan, as
      they entered Fallowfield, laid the state of his purse before Jack, and
      earned anew the epithet of Amadis, when it came to be told that the
      occupant of the waggon was likewise one of its pensioners.
    
    
      Sleep had long held its reign in Fallowfield. Nevertheless, Mr. Raikes,
      though blind windows alone looked on him, and nought foreign was to be
      imputed to him in the matter of pride, had become exceedingly solicitous
      concerning his presentation to the inhabitants of that quiet little
      country town; and while Evan and       the waggoner consulted the former
      with regard to the chances of procuring beds and supper, the latter as to
      his prospect of beer and a comfortable riddance of the feminine burden
      weighing on them all       Mr. Raikes was engaged in persuading his hat to
      assume something of the gentlemanly polish of its youth, and might have
      been observed now and then furtively catching up a leg to be dusted. Ere
      the wheels of the waggon stopped he had gained that ease of mind which the
      knowledge that you have done all a man may do and circumstances warrant,
      establishes. Capacities conscious of their limits may repose even proudly
      when they reach them; and, if Mr. Raikes had not quite the air of one come
      out of a bandbox, he at least proved to the discerning intelligence that
      he knew what sort of manner befitted that happy occasion, and was enabled
      by the pains he had taken to glance with a challenge at the sign of the
      hostelry, under which they were now ranked, and from which, though the
      hour was late, and Fallowfield a singularly somnolent little town, there
      issued signs of life approaching to festivity.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XI. DOINGS AT AN INN
    
    
      What every traveller sighs to find, was palatably furnished by the Green
      Dragon of Fallowfield       a famous inn, and a constellation for
      wandering coachmen. There pleasant smiles seasoned plenty, and the bill
      was gilded in a manner unknown to our days. Whoso drank of the ale of the
      Green Dragon kept in his memory a place apart for it. The secret, that to
      give a warm welcome is the breath of life to an inn, was one the Green
      Dragon boasted, even then, not to share with many Red Lions, or Cocks of
      the Morning, or Kings' Heads, or other fabulous monsters; and as if to
      show that when you are in the right track you are sure to be seconded,
      there was a friend of the Green Dragon, who, on a particular night of the
      year, caused its renown to enlarge to the dimensions of a miracle. But
      that, for the moment, is my secret.
    
    
      Evan and Jack were met in the passage by a chambermaid. Before either of
      them could speak, she had turned and fled, with the words:
    
    
      'More coming!' which, with the addition of 'My goodness me!' were echoed
      by the hostess in her recess. Hurried directions seemed to be consequent,
      and then the hostess sallied out, and said, with a curtsey:
    
    
      'Please to step in, gentlemen. This is the room, tonight.'
    
    
      Evan lifted his hat; and bowing, requested to know whether they could have
      a supper and beds.
    
    
      'Beds, Sir!' cried the hostess. 'What am I to do for beds! Yes, beds
      indeed you may have, but bed-rooms       if you ask for them, it really is
      more than I can supply you with. I have given up my own. I sleep with my
      maid Jane to-night.'
    
    
      'Anything will do for us, madam,' replied Evan, renewing his foreign
      courtesy. 'But there is a poor young woman outside.'
    
    
      'Another!' The hostess instantly smiled down her inhospitable outcry.
    
    
      'She,' said Evan, 'must have a room to herself. She is ill.'
    
    
      'Must is must, sir,' returned the gracious hostess. 'But I really haven't
      the means.'
    
    
      'You have bed-rooms, madam?'
    
    
      'Every one of them engaged, sir.'
    
    
      'By ladies, madam?'
    
    
      'Lord forbid, Sir!' she exclaimed with the honest energy of a woman who
      knew her sex.
    
    
      Evan bade Jack go and assist the waggoner to bring in the girl. Jack, who
      had been all the time pulling at his wristbands, and settling his
      coat-collar by the dim reflection of a window of the bar, departed, after,
      on his own authority, assuring the hostess that fever was not the young
      woman's malady, as she protested against admitting fever into her house,
      seeing that she had to consider her guests.
    
    
      'We're open to all the world to-night, except fever,' said the hostess.
      'Yes,' she rejoined to Evan's order that the waggoner and his mate should
      be supplied with ale, 'they shall have as much as they can drink,' which
      is not a speech usual at inns, when one man gives an order for others, but
      Evan passed it by, and politely begged to be shown in to one of the
      gentlemen who had engaged bedrooms.
    
    
      'Oh! if you can persuade any of them, sir, I'm sure I've nothing to say,'
      observed the hostess. 'Pray, don't ask me to stand by and back it, that's
      all.'
    
    
      Had Evan been familiar with the Green Dragon, he would have noticed that
      the landlady, its presiding genius, was stiffer than usual; the rosy smile
      was more constrained, as if a great host had to be embraced, and were
      trying it to the utmost stretch. There was, however, no asperity about
      her, and when she had led him to the door he was to enter to prefer his
      suit, and she had asked whether the young woman was quite common, and he
      had replied that he had picked her up on the road, and that she was
      certainly poor, the hostess said:
    
    
      'I 'm sure you're a very good gentleman, sir, and if I could spare your
      asking at all, I would.'
    
    
      With that she went back to encounter Mr. Raikes and his charge, and prime
      the waggoner and his mate.
    
    
      A noise of laughter and talk was stilled gradually, as Evan made his bow
      into a spacious room, wherein, as the tops of pines are seen swimming on
      the morning mist, about a couple of dozen guests of divers conditions sat
      partially revealed through wavy clouds of tobacco-smoke. By their
      postures, which Evan's appearance by no means disconcerted, you read in a
      glance men who had been at ease for so many hours that they had no
      troubles in the world save the two ultimate perplexities of the British
      Sybarite, whose bed of roses is harassed by the pair of problems: first,
      what to do with his legs; secondly, how to imbibe liquor with the
      slightest possible derangement of those members subordinate to his upper
      structure. Of old the Sybarite complained. Not so our self-helpful
      islanders. Since they could not, now that work was done and jollity the
      game, take off their legs, they got away from them as far as they might,
      in fashions original or imitative: some by thrusting them out at full
      length; some by cramping them under their chairs: while some, taking
      refuge in a mental effort, forgot them, a process to be recommended if it
      did not involve occasional pangs of consciousness to the legs of their
      neighbours. We see in our cousins West of the great water, who are said to
      exaggerate our peculiarities, beings labouring under the same difficulty,
      and intent on its solution. As to the second problem: that of drinking
      without discomposure to the subservient limbs: the company present worked
      out this republican principle ingeniously, but in a manner beneath the
      attention of the Muse. Let Clio record that mugs and glasses, tobacco and
      pipes, were strewn upon the table. But if the guests had arrived at that
      stage when to reach the arm, or arrange the person, for a sip of good
      stuff, causes moral debates, and presents to the mind impediments equal to
      what would be raised in active men by the prospect of a great excursion,
      it is not to be wondered at that the presence of a stranger produced no
      immediate commotion. Two or three heads were half turned; such as faced
      him imperceptibly lifted their eyelids.
    
    
      'Good evening, sir,' said one who sat as chairman, with a decisive nod.
    
    
      'Good night, ain't it?' a jolly-looking old fellow queried of the speaker,
      in an under-voice.
    
    
      'Gad, you don't expect me to be wishing the gentleman good-bye, do you?'
      retorted the former.
    
    
      'Ha! ha! No, to be sure,' answered the old boy; and the remark was
      variously uttered, that 'Good night,' by a caprice of our language, did
      sound like it.
    
    
      'Good evening's "How d' ye do?"       "How are ye?" Good night's "Be off,
      and be blowed to you,"' observed an interpreter with a positive mind; and
      another, whose intelligence was not so clear, but whose perceptions had
      seized the point, exclaimed: 'I never says it when I hails a chap; but,
      dash my buttons, if I mightn't 'a done, one day or another! Queer!'
    
    
      The chairman, warmed by his joke, added, with a sharp wink: 'Ay; it would
      be queer, if you hailed "Good night" in the middle of the day!' and this
      among a company soaked in ripe ale, could not fail to run the electric
      circle, and persuaded several to change their positions; in the rumble of
      which, Evan's reply, if he had made any, was lost. Few, however, were
      there who could think of him, and ponder on that glimpse of fun, at the
      same time; and he would have been passed over, had not the chairman said:
      'Take a seat, sir; make yourself comfortable.'
    
    
      'Before I have that pleasure,' replied Evan, 'I       '
    
    
      'I see where 'tis,' burst out the old boy who had previously superinduced
      a diversion: 'he's going to ax if he can't have a bed!'
    
    
      A roar of laughter, and 'Don't you remember this day last year?' followed
      the cunning guess. For awhile explication was impossible; and Evan
      coloured, and smiled, and waited for them.
    
    
      'I was going to ask       '
    
    
      'Said so!' shouted the old boy, gleefully.
    
    
      '       one of the gentlemen who has engaged a bed-room to do me the
      extreme favour to step aside with me, and allow me a moment's speech with
      him.'
    
    
      Long faces were drawn, and odd stares were directed toward him, in reply.
    
    
      'I see where 'tis'; the old boy thumped his knee. 'Ain't it now? Speak up,
      sir! There's a lady in the case?'
    
    
      'I may tell you thus much,' answered Evan, 'that it is an unfortunate
      young woman, very ill, who needs rest and quiet.'
    
    
      'Didn't I say so?' shouted the old boy.
    
    
      But this time, though his jolly red jowl turned all round to demand a
      confirmation, it was not generally considered that he had divined so
      correctly. Between a lady and an unfortunate young woman, there seemed to
      be a strong distinction, in the minds of the company.
    
    
      The chairman was the most affected by the communication. His bushy
      eyebrows frowned at Evan, and he began tugging at the brass buttons of his
      coat, like one preparing to arm for a conflict.
    
    
      'Speak out, sir, if you please,' he said. 'Above board       no asides       no
      taking advantages. You want me to give up my bed-room for the use of your
      young woman, sir?'
    
    
      Evan replied quietly: 'She is a stranger to me; and if you could see her,
      sir, and know her situation, I think she would move your pity.'
    
    
      'I don't doubt it, sir       I don't doubt it,' returned the chairman.
      'They all move our pity. That's how they get over us. She has diddled you,
      and she would diddle me, and diddle us all-diddle the devil, I dare say,
      when her time comes. I don't doubt it, sir.'
    
    
      To confront a vehement old gentleman, sitting as president in an assembly
      of satellites, requires command of countenance, and Evan was not
      browbeaten: he held him, and the whole room, from where he stood, under a
      serene and serious eye, for his feelings were too deeply stirred on behalf
      of the girl to let him think of himself. That question of hers, 'What are
      you going to do with me?' implying such helplessness and trust, was still
      sharp on his nerves.
    
    
      'Gentlemen,' he said, 'I humbly beg your pardon for disturbing you as I
      do.'
    
    
      But with a sudden idea that a general address on behalf of a particular
      demand must necessarily fail, he let his eyes rest on one there, whose
      face was neither stupid nor repellent, and who, though he did not look up,
      had an attentive, thoughtful cast about the mouth.
    
    
      'May I entreat a word apart with you, sir?'
    
    
      Evan was not mistaken in the index he had perused. The gentleman seemed to
      feel that he was selected from the company, and slightly raising his head,
      carelessly replied: 'My bed is entirely at your disposal,' resuming his
      contemplative pose.
    
    
      On the point of thanking him, Evan advanced a step, when up started the
      irascible chairman.
    
    
      'I don't permit it! I won't allow it!' And before Evan could ask his
      reasons, he had rung the bell, muttering: 'They follow us to our inns,
      now, the baggages! They must harry us at our inns! We can't have peace and
      quiet at our inns!       '
    
    
      In a state of combustion, he cried out to the waiter:
    
    
      'Here, Mark, this gentleman has brought in a dirty wench: pack her up to
      my bed-room, and lock her in lock her in, and bring down the key.'
    
    
      Agreeably deceived in the old gentleman's intentions, Evan could not
      refrain from joining the murmured hilarity created by the conclusion of
      his order. The latter glared at him, and added: 'Now, sir, you've done
      your worst. Sit down, and be merry.'
    
    
      Replying that he had a friend outside, and would not fail to accept the
      invitation, Evan retired. He was met by the hostess with the reproachful
      declaration on her lips, that she was a widow woman, wise in appearances,
      and that he had brought into her house that night work she did not expect,
      or bargain for. Rather (since I must speak truth of my gentleman) to
      silence her on the subject, and save his ears, than to propitiate her
      favour towards the girl, Evan drew out his constitutionally lean purse,
      and dropped it in her hand, praying her to put every expense incurred to
      his charge. She exclaimed:
    
    
      'If Dr. Pillie has his full sleep this night, I shall be astonished'; and
      Evan hastily led Jack into the passage to impart to him, that the extent
      of his resources was reduced to the smallest of sums in shillings.
    
    
      'I can beat my friend at that reckoning,' said Mr. Raikes; and they
      entered the room.
    
    
      Eyes were on him. This had ever the effect of causing him to swell to
      monstrous proportions in the histrionic line. Asking the waiter carelessly
      for some light supper dish, he suggested the various French, with 'not
      that?' and the affable naming of another. 'Nor that? Dear me, we shall
      have to sup on chops, I believe!'
    
    
      Evan saw the chairman scrutinizing Raikes, much as he himself might have
      done, and he said: 'Bread and cheese for me.'
    
    
      Raikes exclaimed: 'Really? Well, my lord, you lead, and your taste is
      mine!'
    
    
      A second waiter scudded past, and stopped before the chairman to say: 'If
      you please, sir, the gentlemen upstairs send their compliments, and will
      be happy to accept.'
    
    
      'Ha!' was the answer. 'Thought better of it, have they! Lay for three
      more, then. Five more, I guess.' He glanced at the pair of intruders.
    
    
      Among a portion of the guests there had been a return to common talk, and
      one had observed that he could not get that 'Good Evening,' and 'Good
      Night,' out of his head which had caused a friend to explain the meaning
      of these terms of salutation to him: while another, of a philosophic turn,
      pursued the theme: 'You see, when we meets, we makes a night of it. So,
      when we parts, it's Good Night       natural! ain't it?' A proposition
      assented to, and considerably dilated on; but whether he was laughing at
      that, or what had aroused the fit, the chairman did not say.
    
    
      Gentle chuckles had succeeded his laughter by the time the bread and
      cheese appeared.
    
    
      In the rear of the provision came three young gentlemen, of whom the
      foremost lumped in, singing to one behind him, 'And you shall have little
      Rosey!'
    
    
      They were clad in cricketing costume, and exhibited the health and manners
      of youthful Englishmen of station. Frolicsome young bulls bursting on an
      assemblage of sheep, they might be compared to. The chairman welcomed them
      a trifle snubbingly. The colour mounted to the cheeks of Mr. Raikes as he
      made incision in the cheese, under their eyes, knitting his brows
      fearfully, as if at hard work.
    
    
      The chairman entreated Evan to desist from the cheese; and, pulling out
      his watch, thundered: 'Time!'
    
    
      The company generally jumped on their legs; and, in the midst of a hum of
      talk and laughter, he informed Evan and Jack, that he invited them
      cordially to a supper up-stairs, and would be pleased if they would
      partake of it, and in a great rage if they would not.
    
    
      Raikes was for condescending to accept.
    
    
      Evan sprang up and cried: 'Gladly, sir,' and gladly would he have cast his
      cockney schoolmate to the winds, in the presence of these young
      cricketers; for he had a prognostication.
    
    
      The door was open, and the company of jolly yeomen, tradesmen, farmers,
      and the like, had become intent on observing all the ceremonies of
      precedence: not one would broaden his back on the other; and there was
      bowing, and scraping, and grimacing, till Farmer Broadmead was hailed
      aloud, and the old boy stepped forth, and was summarily pushed through:
      the chairman calling from the rear, 'Hulloa! no names to-night!' to which
      was answered lustily: 'All right, Mr. Tom!' and the speaker was reproved
      with, 'There you go! at it again!' and out and up they hustled.
    
    
      The chairman said quietly to Evan, as they were ascending the stairs: 'We
      don't have names to-night; may as well drop titles.' Which presented no
      peculiar meaning to Evan's mind, and he smiled the usual smile.
    
    
      To Raikes, at the door of the supper-room, the chairman repeated the same;
      and with extreme affability and alacrity of abnegation, the other
      rejoined, 'Oh, certainly!'
    
    
      No wonder that he rubbed his hands with more delight than aristocrats and
      people with gentlemanly connections are in the habit of betraying at the
      prospect of refection, for the release from bread and cheese was rendered
      overpoweringly glorious, in his eyes, by the bountiful contrast exhibited
      on the board before him.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XII. IN WHICH ALE IS SHOWN TO HAVE ONE QUALITY OF WINE
    
    
      To proclaim that yon ribs of beef and yonder ruddy Britons have met, is to
      furnish matter for an hour's comfortable meditation.
    
    
      Digest the fact. Here the Fates have put their seal to something Nature
      clearly devised. It was intended; and it has come to pass. A thing has
      come to pass which we feel to be right! The machinery of the world, then,
      is not entirely dislocated: there is harmony, on one point, among the
      mysterious powers who have to do with us.
    
    
      Apart from its eloquent and consoling philosophy, the picture is pleasant.
      You see two rows of shoulders resolutely set for action: heads in divers
      degrees of proximity to their plates: eyes variously twinkling, or
      hypocritically composed: chaps in vigorous exercise. Now leans a fellow
      right back with his whole face to the firmament: Ale is his adoration. He
      sighs not till he sees the end of the mug. Now from one a laugh is sprung;
      but, as if too early tapped, he turns off the cock, and primes himself
      anew. Occupied by their own requirements, these Britons allow that their
      neighbours have rights: no cursing at waste of time is heard when plates
      have to be passed: disagreeable, it is still duty. Field-Marshal Duty, the
      Briton's chief star, shines here. If one usurps more than his allowance of
      elbow-room, bring your charge against them that fashioned him: work away
      to arrive at some compass yourself.
    
    
      Now the mustard ceases to travel, and the salt: the guests have leisure to
      contemplate their achievements. Laughs are more prolonged, and come from
      the depths.
    
    
      Now Ale, which is to Beef what Eve was to Adam, threatens to take
      possession of the field. Happy they who, following Nature's direction,
      admitted not bright ale into their Paradise till their manhood was
      strengthened with beef. Some, impatient, had thirsted; had satisfied their
      thirst; and the ale, the light though lovely spirit, with nothing to hold
      it down, had mounted to their heads; just as Eve will do when Adam is not
      mature: just as she did       Alas!
    
    
      Now, the ruins of the feast being removed, and a clear course left for the
      flow of ale, Farmer Broadmead, facing the chairman, rises. He stands in an
      attitude of midway. He speaks:
    
    
      'Gentlemen! 'Taint fust time you and I be met here, to salbrate this here
      occasion. I say, not fust time, not by many a time, 'taint. Well,
      gentlemen, I ain't much of a speaker, gentlemen, as you know. Howsever,
      here I be. No denyin' that. I'm on my legs. This here's a strange enough
      world, and a man 's a gentleman, I say, we ought for to be glad when we
      got 'm. You know: I'm coming to it shortly. I ain't much of a speaker, and
      if you wants somethin' new, you must ax elsewhere: but what I say is       Bang
      it! here's good health and long life to Mr. Tom, up there!'
    
    
      'No names!' shouts the chairman, in the midst of a tremendous clatter.
    
    
      Farmer Broadmead moderately disengages his breadth from the seat. He
      humbly axes pardon, which is accorded him with a blunt nod.
    
    
      Ale (to Beef what Eve was to Adam) circulates beneath a dazzling foam,
      fair as the first woman.
    
    
      Mr. Tom (for the breach of the rules in mentioning whose name on a night
      when identities are merged, we offer sincere apologies every other
      minute), Mr. Tom is toasted. His parents, who selected that day sixty
      years ago, for his bow to be made to the world, are alluded to with
      encomiums, and float down to posterity on floods of liquid amber.
    
    
      But to see all the subtle merits that now begin to bud out from Mr. Tom,
      the chairman and giver of the feast; and also rightly to appreciate the
      speeches, we require to be enormously charged with Ale. Mr. Raikes did his
      best to keep his head above the surface of the rapid flood. He conceived
      the chairman in brilliant colours, and probably owing to the energy called
      for by his brain, the legs of the young man failed him twice, as he tried
      them. Attention was demanded. Mr. Raikes addressed the meeting.
    
    
      The three young gentlemen-cricketers had hitherto behaved with a certain
      propriety. It did not offend Mr. Raikes to see them conduct themselves as
      if they were at a play, and the rest of the company paid actors. He had
      likewise taken a position, and had been the first to laugh aloud at a
      particular slip of grammar; while his shrugs at the aspirates transposed
      and the pronunciation prevalent, had almost established a free-masonry
      between him and one of the three young gentlemen-cricketers       a
      fair-haired youth, with a handsome, reckless face, who leaned on the
      table, humorously eyeing the several speakers, and exchanging by-words and
      laughs with his friends on each side of him.
    
    
      But Mr. Raikes had the disadvantage of having come to the table empty in
      stomach       thirsty exceedingly; and, I repeat, that as, without
      experience, you are the victim of divinely given Eve, so, with no
      foundation to receive it upon, are you the victim of good sound Ale. He
      very soon lost his head. He would otherwise have seen that he must produce
      a wonderfully-telling speech if he was to keep the position he had taken,
      and had better not attempt one. The three young cricketers were hostile
      from the beginning. All of them leant forward, calling attention loudly
      laughing for the fun to come.
    
    
      'Gentlemen!' he said: and said it twice. The gap was wide, and he said,
      'Gentlemen!' again.
    
    
      This commencement of a speech proves that you have made the plunge, but
      not that you can swim. At a repetition of 'Gentlemen!' expectancy resolved
      into cynicism.
    
    
      'Gie'n a help,' sang out a son of the plough to a neighbour of the orator.
    
    
      'Hang it!' murmured another, 'we ain't such gentlemen as that comes to.'
    
    
      Mr. Raikes was politely requested to 'tune his pipe.'
    
    
      With a gloomy curiosity as to the results of Jack's adventurous
      undertaking, and a touch of anger at the three whose bearing throughout
      had displeased him, Evan regarded his friend. He, too, had drunk, and upon
      emptiness. Bright ale had mounted to his brain. A hero should be held as
      sacred as the Grand Llama: so let no more be said than that he drank
      still, nor marked the replenishing of his glass.
    
    
      Raikes cleared his throat for a final assault: he had got an image, and
      was dashing off; but, unhappily, as if to make the start seem fair, he was
      guilty of his reiteration, 'Gentlemen.'
    
    
      Everybody knew that it was a real start this time, and indeed he had made
      an advance, and had run straight through half a sentence. It was therefore
      manifestly unfair, inimical, contemptuous, overbearing, and base, for one
      of the three young cricketers at this period to fling back weariedly and
      exclaim: 'By the Lord; too many gentlemen here!'
    
    
      Evan heard him across the table. Lacking the key of the speaker's previous
      conduct, the words might have passed. As it was, they, to the ale-invaded
      head of a young hero, feeling himself the world's equal, and condemned
      nevertheless to bear through life the insignia of Tailordom, not
      unnaturally struck with peculiar offence. There was arrogance, too, in the
      young man who had interposed. He was long in the body, and, when he was
      not refreshing his sight by a careless contemplation of his finger-nails,
      looked down on his company at table, as one may do who comes from loftier
      studies. He had what is popularly known as the nose of our aristocracy: a
      nose that much culture of the external graces, and affectation of suavity,
      are required to soften. Thereto were joined thin lips and arched brows.
      Birth it was possible he could boast, hardly brains. He sat to the right
      of the fair-haired youth, who, with his remaining comrade, a quiet smiling
      fellow, appeared to be better liked by the guests, and had been hailed
      once or twice, under correction of the chairman, as Mr. Harry. The three
      had distinguished one there by a few friendly passages; and this was he
      who had offered his bed to Evan for the service of the girl. The
      recognition they extended to him did not affect him deeply. He was called
      Drummond, and had his place near the chairmen, whose humours he seemed to
      relish.
    
    
      The ears of Mr. Raikes were less keen at the moment than Evan's, but his
      openness to ridicule was that of a man on his legs solus, amid a company
      sitting, and his sense of the same       when he saw himself the victim of
      it       acute. His face was rather comic, and, under the shadow of
      embarrassment, twitching and working for ideas       might excuse a want
      of steadiness and absolute gravity in the countenances of others.
    
    
      The chairman's neighbour, Drummond, whispered him 'Laxley will get up a
      row with that fellow.'
    
    
      'It 's young Jocelyn egging him on,' said the chairman.
    
    
      'Um!' added Drummond: 'it's the friend of that talkative rascal that 's
      dangerous, if it comes to anything.'
    
    
      Mr. Raikes perceived that his host desired him to conclude. So, lifting
      his voice and swinging his arm, he ended: 'Allow me to propose to you the
      Fly in Amber. In other words, our excellent host embalmed in brilliant
      ale! Drink him! and so let him live in our memories for ever!'
    
    
      He sat down very well contented with himself, very little comprehended,
      and applauded loudly.
    
    
      'The Flyin' Number!' echoed Farmer Broadmead, confidently and with
      clamour; adding to a friend, when both had drunk the toast to the dregs,
      'But what number that be, or how many 'tis of 'em, dishes me! But that 's
      ne'ther here nor there.'
    
    
      The chairman and host of the evening stood up to reply, welcomed by
      thunders       'There ye be, Mr. Tom! glad I lives to see ye!' and 'No
      names!' and 'Long life to him!'
    
    
      This having subsided, the chairman spoke, first nodding. 'You don't want
      many words, and if you do, you won't get 'em from me.'
    
    
      Cries of 'Got something better!' took up the blunt address.
    
    
      'You've been true to it, most of you. I like men not to forget a custom.'
    
    
      'Good reason so to be,' and 'A jolly good custom,' replied to both
      sentences.
    
    
      'As to the beef, I hope you didn't find it tough: as to the ale       I
      know all about THAT!'
    
    
      'Aha! good!' rang the verdict.
    
    
      'All I can say is, that this day next year it will be on the table, and I
      hope that every one of you will meet Tom       will meet me here
      punctually. I'm not a Parliament man, so that 'll do.'
    
    
      The chairman's breach of his own rules drowned the termination of his
      speech in an uproar.
    
    
      Re-seating himself, he lifted his glass, and proposed: 'The
      Antediluvians!'
    
    
      Farmer Broadmead echoed: 'The Antediloovians!' appending, as a private
      sentiment, 'And dam rum chaps they were!'
    
    
      The Antediluvians, undoubtedly the toast of the evening, were
      enthusiastically drunk, and in an ale of treble brew.
    
    
      When they had quite gone down, Mr. Raikes ventured to ask for the reason
      of their receiving such honour from a posterity they had so little to do
      with. He put the question mildly, but was impetuously snapped at by the
      chairman.
    
    
      'You respect men for their luck, sir, don't you? Don't be a hypocrite, and
      say you don't       you do. Very well: so do I. That's why I drink "The
      Antediluvians"!'
    
    
      'Our worthy host here' (Drummond, gravely smiling, undertook to elucidate
      the case) 'has a theory that the constitutions of the Postdiluvians have
      been deranged, and their lives shortened, by the miasmas of the Deluge. I
      believe he carries it so far as to say that Noah, in the light of a
      progenitor, is inferior to Adam, owing to the shaking he had to endure in
      the ark, and which he conceives to have damaged the patriarch and the
      nervous systems of his sons. It's a theory, you know.'
    
    
      'They lived close on a thousand years, hale, hearty       and no water!'
      said the chairman.
    
    
      'Well!' exclaimed one, some way down the table, a young farmer, red as a
      cock's comb: 'no fools they, eh, master? Where there's ale, would you
      drink water, my hearty?' and back he leaned to enjoy the tribute to his
      wit; a wit not remarkable, but nevertheless sufficient in the noise it
      created to excite the envy of Mr. Raikes, who, inveterately silly when not
      engaged in a contest, now began to play on the names of the sons of Noah.
    
    
      The chairman lanced a keen light at him from beneath his bushy eyebrows.
    
    
      Before long he had again to call two parties to order. To Raikes, Laxley
      was a puppy: to Laxley, Mr. Raikes was a snob. The antagonism was natural:
      ale did but put the match to the magazine. But previous to an explosion,
      Laxley, who had observed Evan's disgust at Jack's exhibition of himself,
      and had been led to think, by his conduct and clothes in conjunction, that
      Evan was his own equal; a gentleman condescending to the society of a
      low-born acquaintance;       had sought with sundry propitiations,
      intelligent glances, light shrugs, and such like, to divide Evan from
      Jack. He did this, doubtless, because he partly sympathized with Evan, and
      to assure him that he took a separate view of him. Probably Evan was
      already offended, or he held to Jack, as a comrade should, or else it was
      that Tailordom and the pride of his accepted humiliation bellowed in his
      ears, every fresh minute: 'Nothing assume!' I incline to think that the
      more ale he drank the fiercer rebel he grew against conventional ideas of
      rank, and those class-barriers which we scorn so vehemently when we find
      ourselves kicking at them. Whatsoever the reason that prompted him, he did
      not respond to Laxley's advances; and Laxley, disregarding him, dealt with
      Raikes alone.
    
    
      In a tone plainly directed at him, he said: 'Well, Harry, tired of this?
      The agriculturals are good fun, but I can't stand much of the small
      cockney. A blackguard who tries to make jokes out of the Scriptures ought
      to be kicked!'
    
    
      Harry rejoined, with wet lips: 'Wopping stuff, this ale! Who's that you
      want to kick?'
    
    
      'Somebody who objects to his bray, I suppose,' Mr. Raikes struck in,
      across the table, negligently thrusting out his elbow to support his head.
    
    
      'Did you allude to me, sir?' Laxley inquired.
    
    
      'I alluded to a donkey, sir.' Raikes lifted his eyelids to the same level
      as Laxley's: 'a passing remark on that interesting animal.'
    
    
      His friend Harry now came into the ring to try a fall.
    
    
      'Are you an usher in a school?' he asked, meaning by his looks what men of
      science in fisticuffs call business.
    
    
      Mr. Raikes started in amazement. He recovered as quickly.
    
    
      'No, sir, not quite; but I have no doubt I should be able to instruct you
      upon a point or two.'
    
    
      'Good manners, for instance?' remarked the third young cricketer, without
      disturbing his habitual smile.
    
    
      'Or what comes from not observing them,' said Evan, unwilling to have Jack
      over-matched.
    
    
      'Perhaps you'll give me a lesson now?' Harry indicated a readiness to rise
      for either of them.
    
    
      At this juncture the chairman interposed.
    
    
      'Harmony, my lads!       harmony to-night.'
    
    
      Farmer Broadmead, imagining it to be the signal for a song, returned:
    
    
      'All right, Mr.       - Mr. Chair! but we an't got pipes in yet. Pipes
      before harmony, you know, to-night.'
    
    
      The pipes were summoned forthwith. System appeared to regulate the
      proceedings of this particular night at the Green Dragon. The pipes
      charged, and those of the guests who smoked, well fixed behind them,
      celestial Harmony was invoked through the slowly curling clouds. In
      Britain the Goddess is coy. She demands pressure to appear, and great
      gulps of ale. Vastly does she swell the chests of her island children, but
      with the modesty of a maid at the commencement. Precedence again disturbed
      the minds of the company. At last the red-faced young farmer led off with
      'The Rose and the Thorn.' In that day Chloe still lived; nor were the
      amorous transports of Strephon quenched. Mountainous inflation       mouse-like
      issue characterized the young farmer's first verse. Encouraged by manifest
      approbation he now told Chloe that he 'by Heaven! never would plant in
      that bosom a thorn,' with such a volume of sound as did indeed show how a
      lover's oath should be uttered in the ear of a British damsel to subdue
      her.
    
    
      'Good!' cried Mr. Raikes, anxious to be convivial.
    
    
      Subsiding into impertinence, he asked Laxley, 'Could you tip us a
      Strephonade, sir? Rejoiced to listen to you, I'm sure! Promise you my
      applause beforehand.'
    
    
      Harry replied hotly: 'Will you step out of the room with me a minute?'
    
    
      'Have you a confession to make?' quoth Jack, unmoved. 'Have you planted a
      thorn in the feminine flower-garden? Make a clean breast of it at the
      table. Confess openly and be absolved.'
    
    
      While Evan spoke a word of angry reproof to Raikes, Harry had to be
      restrained by his two friends. The rest of the company looked on with
      curiosity; the mouth of the chairman was bunched. Drummond had his eyes on
      Evan, who was gazing steadily at the three. Suddenly 'The fellow isn't a
      gentleman!' struck the attention of Mr. Raikes with alarming force.
    
    
      Raikes       and it may be because he knew he could do more than Evan in
      this respect       vociferated: 'I'm the son of a gentleman!'
    
    
      Drummond, from the head of the table, saw that a diversion was imperative.
      He leaned forward, and with a look of great interest said:
    
    
      'Are you? Pray, never disgrace your origin, then.'
    
    
      'If the choice were offered me, I think I would rather have known his
      father,' said the smiling fellow, yawning, and rocking on his chair.
    
    
      'You would, possibly, have been exceedingly intimate       with his right
      foot,' said Raikes.
    
    
      The other merely remarked: 'Oh! that is the language of the son of a
      gentleman.'
    
    
      The tumult of irony, abuse, and retort, went on despite the efforts of
      Drummond and the chairman. It was odd; for at Farmer Broadmead's end of
      the table, friendship had grown maudlin: two were seen in a drowsy
      embrace, with crossed pipes; and others were vowing deep amity, and
      offering to fight the man that might desire it.
    
    
      'Are ye a friend? or are ye a foe?' was heard repeatedly, and consequences
      to the career of the respondent, on his choice of affirmatives to either
      of these two interrogations, emphatically detailed.
    
    
      It was likewise asked, in reference to the row at the gentlemen's end:
      'Why doan' they stand up and have 't out?'
    
    
      'They talks, they speechifies       why doan' they fight for 't, and then
      be friendly?'
    
    
      'Where's the yarmony, Mr. Chair, I axes       so please ye?' sang out
      Farmer Broadmead.
    
    
      'Ay, ay! Silence!' the chairman called.
    
    
      Mr. Raikes begged permission to pronounce his excuses, but lapsed into a
      lamentation for the squandering of property bequeathed to him by his
      respected uncle, and for which       as far as he was intelligible       he
      persisted in calling the three offensive young cricketers opposite to
      account.
    
    
      Before he could desist, Harmony, no longer coy, burst on the assembly from
      three different sources. 'A Man who is given to Liquor,' soared aloft with
      'The Maid of sweet Seventeen,' who participated in the adventures of
      'Young Molly and the Kicking Cow'; while the guests selected the chorus of
      the song that first demanded it.
    
    
      Evan probably thought that Harmony was herself only when she came single,
      or he was wearied of his fellows, and wished to gaze a moment on the skies
      whose arms were over and around his young beloved. He went to the window
      and threw it up, and feasted his sight on the moon standing on the downs.
      He could have wept at the bitter ignominy that severed him from Rose. And
      again he gathered his pride as a cloak, and defied the world, and gloried
      in the sacrifice that degraded him. The beauty of the night touched him,
      and mixed these feelings with mournfulness. He quite forgot the bellow and
      clatter behind. The beauty of the night, and heaven knows what treacherous
      hope in the depths of his soul, coloured existence warmly.
    
    
      He was roused from his reverie by an altercation unmistakeably fierce.
    
    
      Raikes had been touched on a tender point. In reply to a bantering remark
      of his, Laxley had hummed over bits of his oration, amid the chuckles of
      his comrades. Unfortunately at a loss for a biting retort, Raikes was
      reduced to that plain confession of a lack of wit; he offered combat.
    
    
      'I 'll tell you what,' said Laxley, 'I never soil my hands with a
      blackguard; and a fellow who tries to make fun of Scripture, in my opinion
      is one. A blackguard       do you hear? But, if you'll give me
      satisfactory proofs that you really are what I have some difficulty in
      believing the son of a gentleman       I 'll meet you when and where you
      please.'
    
    
      'Fight him, anyhow,' said Harry. 'I 'll take him myself after we finish
      the match to-morrow.'
    
    
      Laxley rejoined that Mr. Raikes must be left to him.
    
    
      'Then I'll take the other,' said Harry. 'Where is he?'
    
    
      Evan walked round to his place.
    
    
      'I am here,' he answered, 'and at your service.'
    
    
      'Will you fight?' cried Harry.
    
    
      There was a disdainful smile on Evan's mouth, as he replied: 'I must first
      enlighten you. I have no pretensions to your blue blood, or yellow. If,
      sir, you will deign to challenge a man who is not the son of a gentleman,
      and consider the expression of his thorough contempt for your conduct
      sufficient to enable you to overlook that fact, you may dispose of me. My
      friend here has, it seems, reason to be proud of his connections. That you
      may not subsequently bring the charge against me of having led you to
      "soil your hands"       as your friend there terms it       I, with all
      the willingness in the world to chastise you or him for your impertinence,
      must first give you a fair chance of escape, by telling you that my father
      was a tailor.'
    
    
      The countenance of Mr. Raikes at the conclusion of this speech was a
      painful picture. He knocked the table passionately, exclaiming:
    
    
      'Who'd have thought it?'
    
    
      Yet he had known it. But he could not have thought it possible for a man
      to own it publicly.
    
    
      Indeed, Evan could not have mentioned it, but for hot fury and the ale. It
      was the ale in him expelling truth; and certainly, to look at him, none
      would have thought it.
    
    
      'That will do,' said Laxley, lacking the magnanimity to despise the
      advantage given him, 'you have chosen the very best means of saving your
      skins.'
    
    
      'We 'll come to you when our supply of clothes runs short,' added Harry.
      'A snip!'
    
    
      'Pardon me!' said Evan, with his eyes slightly widening, 'but if you come
      to me, I shall no longer give you a choice of behaviour. I wish you
      good-night, gentlemen. I shall be in this house, and am to be found here,
      till ten o'clock to-morrow morning. Sir,' he addressed the chairman, 'I
      must apologize to you for this interruption to your kindness, for which I
      thank you very sincerely. It 's "good-night," now, sir,' he pursued,
      bowing, and holding out his hand, with a smile.
    
    
      The chairman grasped it: 'You're a hot-headed young fool, sir: you're an
      ill-tempered ferocious young ass. Can't you see another young donkey
      without joining company in kicks-eh? Sit down, and don't dare to spoil the
      fun any more. You a tailor! Who'll believe it? You're a nobleman in
      disguise. Didn't your friend say so?       ha! ha! Sit down.' He pulled
      out his watch, and proclaiming that he was born into this world at the
      hour about to strike, called for a bumper all round.
    
    
      While such of the company as had yet legs and eyes unvanquished by the
      potency of the ale, stood up to drink and cheer, Mark, the waiter,
      scurried into the room, and, to the immense stupefaction of the chairman,
      and amusement of his guests, spread the news of the immediate birth of a
      little stranger on the premises, who was declared by Dr. Pillie to be a
      lusty boy, and for whom the kindly landlady solicited good luck to be
      drunk.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XIII. THE MATCH OF FALLOW FIELD AGAINST BECKLEY
    
    
      The dramatic proportions to which ale will exalt the sentiments within us,
      and our delivery of them, are apt to dwindle and shrink even below the
      natural elevation when we look back on them from the hither shore of the
      river of sleep       in other words, wake in the morning: and it was with
      no very self-satisfied emotions that Evan, dressing by the full light of
      day, reviewed his share in the events of the preceding night. Why, since
      he had accepted his fate, should he pretend to judge the conduct of people
      his superiors in rank? And where was the necessity for him to thrust the
      fact of his being that abhorred social pariah down the throats of an
      assembly of worthy good fellows? The answer was, that he had not accepted
      his fate: that he considered himself as good a gentleman as any man
      living, and was in absolute hostility with the prejudices of society. That
      was the state of the case: but the evaporation of ale in his brain caused
      him to view his actions from the humble extreme of that delightful liquor,
      of which the spirit had flown and the corpse remained.
    
    
      Having revived his system with soda-water, and finding no sign of his
      antagonist below, Mr. Raikes, to disperse the sceptical dimples on his
      friend's face, alluded during breakfast to a determination he had formed
      to go forth and show on the cricket-field.
    
    
      'For, you know,' he observed, 'they can't have any objection to fight
      one.'
    
    
      Evan, slightly colouring, answered: 'Why, you said up-stairs, you thought
      fighting duels disgraceful folly.'
    
    
      'So it is, so it is; everybody knows that,' returned Jack; 'but what can a
      gentleman do?'
    
    
      'Be a disgraceful fool, I suppose,' said Evan: and Raikes went on with his
      breakfast, as if to be such occasionally was the distinguished fate of a
      gentleman, of which others, not so happy in their birth, might well be
      envious.
    
    
      He could not help betraying that he bore in mind the main incidents of the
      festival over-night; for when he had inquired who it might be that had
      reduced his friend to wear mourning, and heard that it was his father
      (spoken by Evan with a quiet sigh), Mr. Raikes tapped an egg, and his
      flexible brows exhibited a whole Bar of contending arguments within. More
      than for the love of pleasure, he had spent his money to be taken for a
      gentleman. He naturally thought highly of the position, having bought it.
      But Raikes appreciated a capital fellow, and felt warmly to Evan, who,
      moreover, was feeding him.
    
    
      If not born a gentleman, this Harrington had the look of one, and was
      pleasing in female eyes, as the landlady, now present, bore witness,
      wishing them good morning, and hoping they had slept well. She handed to
      Evan his purse, telling him she had taken it last night, thinking it safer
      for the time being in her pocket; and that the chairman of the feast paid
      for all in the Green Dragon up to twelve that day, he having been born
      between the hours, and liking to make certain: and that every year he did
      the same; and was a seemingly rough old gentleman, but as soft-hearted as
      a chicken. His name must positively not be inquired, she said; to be
      thankful to him was to depart, asking no questions.
    
    
      'And with a dart in the bosom from those eyes       those eyes!' cried
      Jack, shaking his head at the landlady's resistless charms.
    
    
      'I hope you was not one of the gentlemen who came and disturbed us last
      night, Sir?' she turned on him sharply.
    
    
      Jack dallied with the imputation, but denied his guilt.
    
    
      'No; it wasn't your voice,' continued the landlady. 'A parcel of young
      puppies calling themselves gentlemen! I know him. It's that young Mr.
      Laxley: and he the nephew of a Bishop, and one of the Honourables! and
      then the poor gals get the blame. I call it a shame, I do. There's that
      poor young creature up-stairs-somebody's victim she is: and nobody's to
      suffer but herself, the little fool!'
    
    
      'Yes,' said Raikes. 'Ah! we regret these things in after life!' and he
      looked as if he had many gentlemanly burdens of the kind on his
      conscience.
    
    
      'It 's a wonder, to my mind,' remarked the landlady, when she had placidly
      surveyed Mr. Raikes, 'how young gals can let some of you men-folk mislead
      'em.'
    
    
      She turned from him huffily, and addressed Evan:
    
    
      'The old gentleman is gone, sir. He slept on a chair, breakfasted, and was
      off before eight. He left word, as the child was born on his birthright,
      he'd provide for it, and pay the mother's bill, unless you claimed the
      right. I'm afraid he suspected       what I never, never-no! but by what
      I've seen of you       never will believe. For you, I'd say, must be a
      gentleman, whatever your company. She asks one favour of you, sir:       for
      you to go and let her speak to you once before you go away for good. She's
      asleep now, and mustn't be disturbed. Will you do it, by-and-by? Please to
      comfort the poor creature, sir.'
    
    
      Evan consented. I am afraid also it was the landlady's flattering speech
      made him, without reckoning his means, add that the young mother and her
      child must be considered under his care, and their expenses charged to
      him. The landlady was obliged to think him a wealthy as well as a noble
      youth, and admiringly curtsied.
    
    
      Mr. John Raikes and Mr. Evan Harrington then strolled into the air, and
      through a long courtyard, with brewhouse and dairy on each side, and a
      pleasant smell of baking bread, and dogs winking in the sun, cats at the
      corners of doors, satisfied with life, and turkeys parading, and fowls,
      strutting cocks, that overset the dignity of Mr. Raikes by awakening his
      imitative propensities. Certain white-capped women, who were washing in a
      tub, laughed, and one observed: 'He's for all the world like the little
      bantam cock stickin' 'self up in a crow against the Spaniar'.' And this,
      and the landlady's marked deference to Evan, induced Mr. Raikes
      contemptuously to glance at our national blindness to the true diamond,
      and worship of the mere plumes in which a person is dressed.
    
    
      They passed a pretty flower-garden, and entering a smooth-shorn meadow,
      beheld the downs beautifully clear under sunlight and slowly-sailing
      images of cloud. At the foot of the downs, on a plain of grass, stood a
      white booth topped by a flag, which signalled that on that spot Fallow
      field and Beckley were contending.
    
    
      'A singular old gentleman! A very singular old gentleman, that!' Raikes
      observed, following an idea that had been occupying him. 'We did wrong to
      miss him. We ought to have waylaid him in the morning. Never miss a
      chance, Harrington.'
    
    
      'What chance?' Evan inquired.
    
    
      'Those old gentlemen are very odd,' Jack pursued, 'very strange. He
      wouldn't have judged me by my attire. Admetus' flocks I guard, yet am a
      God! Dress is nothing to those old cocks. He's an eccentric. I know it; I
      can see it. He 's a corrective of Cudford, who is abhorrent to my soul. To
      give you an instance, now, of what those old boys will do       I remember
      my father taking me, when I was quite a youngster, to a tavern he
      frequented, and we met one night just such an old fellow as this; and the
      waiter told us afterwards that he noticed me particularly. He thought me a
      very remarkable boy       predicted great things. For some reason or other
      my father never took me there again. I remember our having a Welsh rarebit
      there for supper, and when the waiter last night mentioned a rarebit, 'gad
      he started up before me. I gave chase into my early youth. However, my
      father never took me to meet the old fellow again. I believe it lost me a
      fortune.'
    
    
      Evan's thoughts were leaping to the cricket-field, or he would have
      condoled with Mr. Raikes for a loss that evidently afflicted him still.
    
    
      Now, it must be told that the lady's-maid of Mrs. Andrew Cogglesby,
      borrowed temporarily by the Countess de Saldar for service at Beckley
      Court, had slept in charge of the Countess's boxes at the Green Dragon:
      the Countess having told her, with the candour of high-born dames to their
      attendants, that it would save expense; and that, besides, Admiral
      Combleman, whom she was going to see, or Sir Perkins Ripley (her father's
      old friend), whom she should visit if Admiral Combleman was not at his
      mansion-both were likely to have full houses, and she could not take them
      by storm. An arrangement which left her upwards of twelve hours' liberty,
      seemed highly proper to Maria Conning, this lady's-maid, a very demure
      young person. She was at her bed-room window, as Evan passed up the
      courtyard of the inn, and recognized him immediately. 'Can it be him they
      mean that's the low tradesman?' was Maria's mysterious exclamation. She
      examined the pair, and added: 'Oh, no. It must be the tall one they
      mistook for the small one. But Mr. Harrington ought not to demean himself
      by keeping company with such, and my lady should know of it.'
    
    
      My lady, alighting from the Lymport coach, did know of it, within a few
      minutes after Evan had quitted the Green Dragon, and turned pale, as
      high-born dames naturally do when they hear of a relative's disregard of
      the company he keeps.
    
    
      'A tailor, my lady!' said scornful Maria; and the Countess jumped and
      complained of a pin.
    
    
      'How did you hear of this, Conning?' she presently asked with composure.
    
    
      'Oh, my lady, he was tipsy last night, and kept swearing out loud he was a
      gentleman.'
    
    
      'Tipsy!' the Countess murmured in terror. She had heard of inaccessible
      truths brought to light by the magic wand of alcohol. Was Evan
      intoxicated, and his dreadful secret unlocked last night?
    
    
      'And who may have told you of this, Conning?' she asked.
    
    
      Maria plunged into one of the boxes, and was understood to say that nobody
      in particular had told her, but that among other flying matters it had
      come to her ears.
    
    
      'My brother is Charity itself,' sighed the Countess. 'He welcomes high or
      low.'
    
    
      'Yes, but, my lady, a tailor!' Maria repeated, and the Countess, agreeing
      with her scorn as she did, could have killed her. At least she would have
      liked to run a bodkin into her, and make her scream. In her position she
      could not always be Charity itself: nor is this the required character for
      a high-born dame: so she rarely affected it.
    
    
      'Order a fly: discover the direction Mr. Harrington has taken; spare me
      further remarks,' she said; and Maria humbly flitted from her presence.
    
    
      When she was gone, the Countess covered her face with her hands. 'Even
      this creature would despise us!' she exclaimed.
    
    
      The young lady encountered by Mr. Raikes on the road to Fallow field, was
      wrong in saying that Beckley would be seen out before the shades of
      evening caught up the ball. Not one, but two men of Beckley       the last
      two       carried out their bats, cheered handsomely by both parties. The
      wickets pitched in the morning, they carried them in again, and plaudits
      renewed proved that their fame had not slumbered. To stand before a field,
      thoroughly aware that every successful stroke you make is adding to the
      hoards of applause in store for you is a joy to your friends, an
      exasperation to your foes; I call this an exciting situation, and one as
      proud as a man may desire. Then, again, the two last men of an eleven are
      twins: they hold one life between them; so that he who dies extinguishes
      the other. Your faculties are stirred to their depths. You become engaged
      in the noblest of rivalries: in defending your own, you fight for your
      comrade's existence. You are assured that the dread of shame, if not
      emulation, is making him equally wary and alert.
    
    
      Behold, then, the two bold men of Beckley fighting to preserve one life.
      Under the shadow of the downs they stand, beneath a glorious day, and
      before a gallant company. For there are ladies in carriages here, there
      are cavaliers; good county names may be pointed out. The sons of
      first-rate families are in the two elevens, mingled with the yeomen and
      whoever can best do the business. Fallow field and Beckley, without regard
      to rank, have drawn upon their muscle and science. One of the bold men of
      Beckley at the wickets is Nick Frim, son of the gamekeeper at Beckley
      Court; the other is young Tom Copping, son of Squire Copping, of Dox Hall,
      in the parish of Beckley. Last year, you must know, Fallow field beat.
      That is why Nick Frim, a renowned out-hitter, good to finish a score
      brilliantly with a pair of threes, has taken to blocking, and Mr. Tom cuts
      with caution, though he loves to steal his runs, and is usually dismissed
      by his remarkable cunning.
    
    
      The field was ringing at a stroke of Nick Frim's, who had lashed out in
      his old familiar style at last, and the heavens heard of it, when Evan
      came into the circle of spectators. Nick and Tom were stretching from post
      to post, might and main. A splendid four was scored. The field took breath
      with the heroes; and presume not to doubt that heroes they are. It is good
      to win glory for your country; it is also good to win glory for your
      village. A Member of Parliament, Sir George Lowton, notes this
      emphatically, from the statesman's eminence, to a group of gentlemen on
      horseback round a carriage wherein a couple of fair ladies reclined.
    
    
      'They didn't shout more at the news of the Battle of Waterloo. Now this is
      our peculiarity, this absence of extreme centralization. It must be
      encouraged. Local jealousies, local rivalries, local triumphs       these
      are the strength of the kingdom.'
    
    
      'If you mean to say that cricket's a               ' the old squire
      speaking (Squire Uplift of Fallow field) remembered the saving presences,
      and coughed       'good thing, I'm one with ye, Sir George. Encouraged,
      egad! They don't want much of that here. Give some of your lean London
      straws a strip o' clean grass and a bit o' liberty, and you'll do 'em a
      service.'
    
    
      'What a beautiful hit!' exclaimed one of the ladies, languidly watching
      the ascent of the ball.
    
    
      'Beautiful, d' ye call it?' muttered the squire.
    
    
      The ball, indeed, was dropping straight into the hands of the
      long-hit-off. Instantly a thunder rolled. But it was Beckley that took the
      joyful treble       Fallow field the deeply       cursing bass. The
      long-hit-off, he who never was known to miss a catch-butter-fingered
      beast!       he has let the ball slip through his fingers.
    
    
      Are there Gods in the air? Fred Linnington, the unfortunate of Fallow
      field, with a whole year of unhappy recollection haunting him in prospect,
      ere he can retrieve his character       Fred, if he does not accuse the
      powers of the sky, protests that he cannot understand it, which means the
      same.
    
    
      Fallow field's defeat       should such be the result of the contest       he
      knows now will be laid at his door. Five men who have bowled at the
      indomitable Beckleyans think the same. Albeit they are Britons, it abashes
      them. They are not the men they were. Their bowling is as the bowling of
      babies; and see! Nick, who gave the catch, and pretends he did it out of
      commiseration for Fallow field, the ball has flown from his bat sheer over
      the booth. If they don't add six to the score, it will be the fault of
      their legs. But no: they rest content with a fiver and cherish their wind.
    
    
      Yet more they mean to do, Success does not turn the heads of these
      Britons, as it would of your frivolous foreigners.
    
    
      And now small boys (who represent the Press here) spread out from the
      marking-booth, announcing foremost, and in larger type, as it were, quite
      in Press style, their opinion       which is, that Fallow field will get a
      jolly good hiding; and vociferating that Beckley is seventy-nine ahead,
      and that Nick Frim, the favourite of the field, has scored fifty-one to
      his own cheek. The boys are boys of both villages: but they are British
      boys       they adore prowess. The Fallow field boys wish that Nick Frim
      would come and live on their side; the boys of Beckley rejoice in
      possessing him. Nick is the wicketkeeper of the Beckley eleven;
      long-limbed, wiry, keen of eye. His fault as a batsman is, that he will be
      a slashing hitter. He is too sensible of the joys of a grand spanking hit.
      A short life and a merry one, has hitherto been his motto.
    
    
      But there were reasons for Nick's rare display of skill. That woman may
      have the credit due to her (and, as there never was a contest of which she
      did not sit at the springs, so is she the source of all superhuman efforts
      exhibited by men), be it told that Polly Wheedle is on the field; Polly,
      one of the upper housemaids of Beckley Court; Polly, eagerly courted by
      Fred Linnington, humbly desired by Nick Frim       a pert and blooming
      maiden       who, while her suitors combat hotly for an undivided smile,
      improves her holiday by instilling similar unselfish aspirations into the
      breasts of others.
    
    
      Between his enjoyment of society and the melancholy it engendered in his
      mind by reflecting on him the age and decrepitude of his hat, Mr. John
      Raikes was doubtful of his happiness for some time. But as his taste for
      happiness was sharp, he, with a great instinct amounting almost to genius
      in its pursuit, resolved to extinguish his suspicion by acting the
      perfectly happy man. To do this, it was necessary that he should have
      listeners: Evan was not enough, and was besides unsympathetic; he had not
      responded to Jack's cordial assurances of his friendship 'in spite of
      anything,' uttered before they came into the field.
    
    
      Heat and lustre were now poured from the sky, on whose soft blue a fleet
      of clouds sailed heavily. Nick Frim was very wonderful, no doubt. He
      deserved that the Gods should recline on those gold-edged cushions above,
      and lean over to observe him. Nevertheless, the ladies were beginning to
      ask when Nick Frim would be out. The small boys alone preserved their
      enthusiasm for Nick. As usual, the men took a middle position. Theirs was
      the pleasure of critics, which, being founded on the judgement, lasts
      long, and is without disappointment at the close. It was sufficient that
      the ladies should lend the inspiration of their bonnets to this fine
      match. Their presence on the field is another beautiful instance of the
      generous yielding of the sex simply to grace our amusement, and their
      acute perception of the part they have to play.
    
    
      Mr. Raikes was rather shy of them at first. But his acting rarely failing
      to deceive himself, he began to feel himself the perfectly happy man he
      impersonated, and where there were ladies he went, and talked of days when
      he had creditably handled a bat, and of a renown in the annals of Cricket
      cut short by mysterious calamity. The foolish fellow did not know that
      they care not a straw for cricketing fame. His gaiety presently forsook
      him as quickly as it had come. Instead of remonstrating at Evan's
      restlessness, it was he who now dragged Evan from spot to spot. He spoke
      low and nervously.
    
    
      'We're watched!'
    
    
      There was indeed a man lurking near and moving as they moved, with a
      speculative air. Writs were out against Raikes. He slipped from his
      friend, saying:
    
    
      'Never mind me. That old amphitryon's birthday hangs on till the meridian;
      you understand. His table invites. He is not unlikely to enjoy my
      conversation. What mayn't that lead to? Seek me there.'
    
    
      Evan strolled on, relieved by the voluntary departure of the weariful
      funny friend he would not shake off, but could not well link with.
    
    
      A long success is better when seen at a distance of time, and Nick Frim
      was beginning to suffer from the monotony of his luck. Fallow field could
      do nothing with him. He no longer blocked. He lashed out at every ball,
      and far flew every ball that was bowled. The critics saw, in this return
      to his old practices, promise of Nick's approaching extinction. The ladies
      were growing hot and weary. The little boys gasped on the grass, but like
      cunning circulators of excitement, spread a report to keep it up, that
      Nick, on going to his wickets the previous day, had sworn an oath that he
      would not lay down his bat till he had scored a hundred.
    
    
      So they had still matter to agitate their youthful breasts, and Nick's
      gradual building up of tens, and prophecies and speculations as to his
      chances of completing the hundred, were still vehemently confided to the
      field, amid a general mopping of faces.
    
    
      Evan did become aware that a man was following him. The man had not the
      look of a dreaded official. His countenance was sun-burnt and open, and he
      was dressed in a countryman's holiday suit. When Evan met his eyes, they
      showed perplexity. Evan felt he was being examined from head to heel, but
      by one unaccustomed to his part, and without the courage to decide what he
      ought consequently to do while a doubt remained, though his inspection was
      verging towards a certainty in his mind.
    
    
      At last, somewhat annoyed that the man should continue to dog him wherever
      he moved, he turned on him and asked him what he wanted?
    
    
      'Be you a Muster Eav'n Harrington, Esquire?' the man drawled out in the
      rustic music of inquiry.
    
    
      'That is my name,' said Evan.
    
    
      'Ay,' returned the man, 'it's somebody lookin' like a lord, and has a
      small friend wi' shockin' old hat, and I see ye come out o' the Green
      Drag'n this mornin'       I don't reck'n there's e'er a mistaak, but I
      likes to make cock sure. Be you been to Poortigal, sir?'
    
    
      'Yes,' answered Evan, 'I have been to Poortigal.'
    
    
      'What's the name o' the capital o' Portugal, sir?' The man looked
      immensely shrewd, and nodding his consent at the laughing reply, added:
    
    
      'And there you was born, sir? You'll excuse my boldness, but I only does
      what's necessary.'
    
    
      Evan said he was not born there.
    
    
      'No, not born there. That's good. Now, sir, did you happen to be born
      anywheres within smell o' salt water?'
    
    
      'Yes,' answered Evan, 'I was born by the sea.'
    
    
      'Not far beyond fifty mile from Fall'field here, sir?'
    
    
      'Something less.'
    
    
      'All right. Now I'm cock sure,' said the man. 'Now, if you'll have the
      kindness just to oblige me by       'he sped the words and the instrument
      jointly at Evan, takin' that there letter, I'll say good-bye, sir, and my
      work's done for the day.'
    
    
      Saying which, he left Evan with the letter in his hands. Evan turned it
      over curiously. It was addressed to 'Evan Harrington, Esquire, T              
      of Lymport.'
    
    
      A voice paralyzed his fingers: the clear ringing voice of a young
      horsewoman, accompanied by a little maid on a pony, who galloped up to the
      carriage upon which Squire Uplift, Sir George Lowton, Hamilton Jocelyn,
      and other cavaliers, were in attendance.
    
    
      'Here I am at last, and Beckley's in still! How d' ye do, Lady Racial? How
      d' ye do, Sir George. How d' ye do, everybody. Your servant, Squire! We
      shall beat you. Harry says we shall soon be a hundred a-head of you. Fancy
      those boys! they would sleep at Fallow field last night. How I wish you
      had made a bet with me, Squire.'
    
    
      'Well, my lass, it's not too late,' said the Squire, detaining her hand.
    
    
      'Oh, but it wouldn't be fair now. And I'm not going to be kissed on the
      field, if you please, Squire. Here, Dorry will do instead. Dorry! come and
      be kissed by the Squire.'
    
    
      It was Rose, living and glowing; Rose, who was the brilliant young Amazon,
      smoothing the neck of a mettlesome gray cob. Evan's heart bounded up to
      her, but his limbs were motionless.
    
    
      The Squire caught her smaller companion in his arms, and sounded a kiss
      upon both her cheeks; then settled her in the saddle, and she went to
      answer some questions of the ladies. She had the same lively eyes as Rose;
      quick saucy lips, red, and open for prattle. Rolls of auburn hair fell
      down her back, for being a child she was allowed privileges. To talk as
      her thoughts came, as well as to wear her hair as it grew, was a special
      privilege of this young person, on horseback or elsewhere.
    
    
      'Now, I know what you want to ask me, Aunt Shorne. Isn't it about my Papa?
      He's not come, and he won't be able to come for a week.       Glad to be
      with Cousin Rosey? I should think I am! She's the nicest girl I ever could
      suppose. She isn't a bit spoiled by Portugal; only browned; and she
      doesn't care for that; no more do I. I rather like the sun when it doesn't
      freckle you. I can't bear freckles, and I don't believe in milk for them.
      People who have them are such a figure. Drummond Forth has them, but he's
      a man, and it doesn't matter for a man to have freckles. How's my uncle
      Mel? Oh, he's quite well. I mean he has the gout in one of his fingers,
      and it's swollen so, it's just like a great fat fir cone! He can't write a
      bit, and rests his hand on a table. He wants to have me made to write with
      my left hand as well as my right. As if I was ever going to have the gout
      in one of my fingers!'
    
    
      Sir George Lowton observed to Hamilton Jocelyn, that Melville must take to
      his tongue now.
    
    
      'I fancy he will,' said Hamilton. 'My father won't give up his nominee; so
      I fancy he'll try Fallow field. Of course, we go in for the agricultural
      interest; but there's a cantankerous old ruffian down here       a brewer,
      or something       he's got half the votes at his bidding. We shall see.'
    
    
      'Dorothy, my dear child, are you not tired?' said Lady Racial. 'You are
      very hot.'
    
    
      'Yes, that's because Rose would tear along the road to get here in time,
      after we had left those tiresome Copping people, where she had to make a
      call. "What a slow little beast your pony is, Dorry!"       she said that
      at least twenty times.'
    
    
      'Oh, you naughty puss!' cried Rose. 'Wasn't it, "Rosey, Rosey, I'm sure we
      shall be too late, and shan't see a thing: do come along as hard as you
      can"?'
    
    
      'I 'm sure it was not,' Miss Dorothy retorted, with the large eyes of
      innocence. 'You said you wanted to see Nick Frim keeping the wicket, and
      Ferdinand Laxley bowl. And, oh! you know something you said about Drummond
      Forth.'
    
    
      'Now, shall I tell upon you?' said Rose.
    
    
      'No, don't!' hastily replied the little woman, blushing. And the cavaliers
      laughed out, and the ladies smiled, and Dorothy added: 'It isn't much,
      after all.'
    
    
      'Then, come; let's have it, or I shall be jealous,' said the Squire.
    
    
      'Shall I tell?' Rose asked slily.
    
    
      'It 's unfair to betray one of your sex, Rose,' remarked the
      sweetly-smiling lady.
    
    
      'Yes, Lady Racial       mayn't a woman have secrets?' Dorothy put it with
      great natural earnestness, and they all laughed aloud. 'But I know a
      secret of Rosey's,' continued Miss Dorothy, 'and if she tells upon me, I
      shall tell upon her.'
    
    
      'They're out!' cried Rose, pointing her whip at the wickets. 'Good night
      to Beckley! Tom Copping 's run out.'
    
    
      Questions as to how it was done passed from mouth to mouth. Questions as
      to whether it was fair sprang from Tom's friends, and that a doubt existed
      was certain: the whole field was seen converging toward the two umpires.
    
    
      Farmer Broadmead for Fallow field, Master Nat Hodges for Beckley.
    
    
      It really is a mercy there's some change in the game,' said Mrs. Shorne,
      waving her parasol. 'It 's a charming game, but it wants variety a little.
      When do you return, Rose?'
    
    
      'Not for some time,' said Rose, primly. 'I like variety very well, but I
      don't seek it by running away the moment I've come.'
    
    
      'No, but, my dear,' Mrs. Shorne negligently fanned her face, 'you will
      have to come with us, I fear, when we go. Your uncle accompanies us. I
      really think the Squire will, too; and Mr. Forth is no chaperon. Even you
      understand that.'
    
    
      'Oh, I can get an old man       don't be afraid, said Rose. 'Or must I
      have and old woman, aunt?'
    
    
      The lady raised her eyelids slowly on Rose, and thought: 'If you were
      soundly whipped, my little madam, what a good thing it would be for you.'
      And that good thing Mrs. Shorne was willing to do for Rose. She turned
      aside, and received the salute of an unmistakable curate on foot.
    
    
      'Ah, Mr. Parsley, you lend your countenance to the game, then?'
    
    
      The curate observed that sound Churchmen unanimously supported the game.
    
    
      'Bravo!' cried Rose. 'How I like to hear you talk like that, Mr. Parsley.
      I didn't think you had so much sense. You and I will have a game together       single
      wicket. We must play for something       what shall it be?'
    
    
      'Oh       for nothing,' the curate vacuously remarked.
    
    
      'That's for love, you rogue!' exclaimed the Squire. 'Come, come, none o'
      that, sir       ha! ha!'
    
    
      'Oh, very well; we'll play for love,' said Rose.
    
    
      'And I'll hold the stakes, my dear       eh?'
    
    
      'You dear old naughty Squire!       what do you mean?'
    
    
      Rose laughed. But she had all the men surrounding her, and Mrs. Shorne
      talked of departing.
    
    
      Why did not Evan bravely march away? Why, he asked himself, had he come on
      this cricket-field to be made thus miserable? What right had such as he to
      look on Rose? Consider, however, the young man's excuses. He could not
      possibly imagine that a damsel who rode one day to a match, would return
      on the following day to see it finished: or absolutely know that unseen
      damsel to be Rose Jocelyn. And if he waited, it was only to hear her sweet
      voice once again, and go for ever. As far as he could fathom his hopes,
      they were that Rose would not see him: but the hopes of youth are deep.
    
    
      Just then a toddling small rustic stopped in front of Evan, and set up a
      howl for his 'fayther.' Evan lifted him high to look over people's heads,
      and discover his wandering parent. The urchin, when he had settled to his
      novel position, surveyed the field, and shouting, 'Fayther, fayther! here
      I bes on top of a gentleman!' made lusty signs, which attracted not his
      father alone. Rose sang out, 'Who can lend me a penny?' Instantly the
      curate and the squire had a race in their pockets. The curate was first,
      but Rose favoured the squire, took his money with a nod and a smile, and
      rode at the little lad, to whom she was saying: 'Here, bonny boy, this
      will buy you       '
    
    
      She stopped and coloured.
    
    
      'Evan!'
    
    
      The child descended rapidly to the ground.
    
    
      A bow and a few murmured words replied to her.
    
    
      'Isn't this just like you, my dear Evan? Shouldn't I know that whenever I
      met you, you would be doing something kind? How did you come here? You
      were on your way to Beckley!'
    
    
      'To London,' said Evan.
    
    
      'To London! and not coming over to see me       us?'
    
    
      Here the little fellow's father intervened to claim his offspring, and
      thank the lady and the gentleman: and, with his penny firmly grasped, he
      who had brought the lady and the gentleman together, was borne off a
      wealthy human creature.
    
    
      Before much further could be said between them, the Countess de Saldar
      drove up.
    
    
      'My dearest Rose!' and 'My dear Countess!' and 'Not Louisa, then?' and, 'I
      am very glad to see you!' without attempting the endearing 'Louisa'       passed.
    
    
      The Countess de Saldar then admitted the presence of her brother.
    
    
      'Think!' said Rose. 'He talks of going on straight from here to London.'
    
    
      'That pretty pout will alone suffice to make him deviate, then,' said the
      Countess, with her sweetest open slyness. 'I am now on the point of
      accepting your most kind invitation. Our foreign habits allow us to visit
      thus early! He will come with me.'
    
    
      Evan tried to look firm, and speak as he was trying to look. Rose fell to
      entreaty, and from entreaty rose to command; and in both was utterly
      fascinating to the poor youth. Luxuriously       while he hesitated and
      dwelt on this and that faint objection       his spirit drank the
      delicious changes of her face. To have her face before him but one day
      seemed so rich a boon to deny himself, that he was beginning to wonder at
      his constancy in refusal; and now that she spoke to him so pressingly,
      devoting her guileless eyes to him alone, he forgot a certain envious
      feeling that had possessed him while she was rattling among the other
      males       a doubt whether she ever cast a thought on Mr. Evan
      Harrington.
    
    
      'Yes; he will come,' cried Rose; 'and he shall ride home with me and my
      friend Drummond; and he shall have my groom's horse, if he doesn't mind.
      Bob can ride home in the cart with Polly, my maid; and he'll like that,
      because Polly's always good fun       when they're not in love with her.
      Then, of course, she torments them.'
    
    
      'Naturally,' said the Countess.
    
    
      Mr. Evan Harrington's final objection, based on his not having clothes,
      and so forth, was met by his foreseeing sister.
    
    
      'I have your portmanteau packed, in with me, my dear brother; Conning has
      her feet on it. I divined that I should overtake you.'
    
    
      Evan felt he was in the toils. After a struggle or two he yielded; and,
      having yielded, did it with grace. In a moment, and with a power of
      self-compression equal to that of the adept Countess, he threw off his
      moodiness as easily as if it had been his Spanish mantle, and assumed a
      gaiety that made the Countess's eyes beam rapturously upon him, and was
      pleasing to Rose, apart from the lead in admiration the Countess had given
      her       not for the first time. We mortals, the best of us, may be silly
      sheep in our likes and dislikes: where there is no premeditated or
      instinctive antagonism, we can be led into warm acknowledgement of merits
      we have not sounded. This the Countess de Saldar knew right well.
    
    
      Rose now intimated her wish to perform the ceremony of introduction
      between her aunt and uncle present, and the visitors to Beckley Court. The
      Countess smiled, and in the few paces that separated the two groups,
      whispered to her brother: 'Miss Jocelyn, my dear.'
    
    
      The eye-glasses of the Beckley group were dropped with one accord. The
      ceremony was gone through. The softly-shadowed differences of a grand
      manner addressed to ladies, and to males, were exquisitely accomplished by
      the Countess de Saldar.
    
    
      'Harrington? Harrington?' her quick ear caught on the mouth of Squire
      Uplift, scanning Evan.
    
    
      Her accent was very foreign, as she said aloud: 'We are entirely strangers
      to your game       your creecket. My brother and myself are scarcely
      English. Nothing save diplomacy are we adepts in!'
    
    
      'You must be excessively dangerous, madam,' said Sir George, hat in air.
    
    
      'Even in that, I fear, we are babes and sucklings, and might take many a
      lesson from you. Will you instruct me in your creecket? What are they
      doing now? It seems very unintelligible       indistinct       is it not?'
    
    
      Inasmuch as Farmer Broadmead and Master Nat Hodges were surrounded by a
      clamorous mob, shouting both sides of the case, as if the loudest and
      longest-winded were sure to wrest a favourable judgement from those two
      infallible authorities on the laws of cricket, the noble game was
      certainly in a state of indistinctness.
    
    
      The squire came forward to explain, piteously entreated not to expect too
      much from a woman's inapprehensive wits, which he plainly promised (under
      eyes that had melted harder men) he would not. His forbearance and bucolic
      gallantry were needed, for he had the Countess's radiant full visage
      alone. Her senses were dancing in her right ear, which had heard the name
      of Lady Racial pronounced, and a voice respond to it from the carriage.
    
    
      Into what a pit had she suddenly plunged! You ask why she did not drive
      away as fast as the horses would carry her, and fly the veiled head of
      Demogorgon obscuring valley and hill and the shining firmament, and
      threatening to glare destruction on her? You do not know an intriguer. She
      relinquishes the joys of life for the joys of intrigue. This is her
      element. The Countess did feel that the heavens were hard on her. She
      resolved none the less to fight her way to her object; for where so much
      had conspired to favour her       the decease of the generous Sir Abraham
      Harrington, of Torquay, and the invitation to Beckley Court       could
      she believe the heavens in league against her? Did she not nightly pray to
      them, in all humbleness of body, for the safe issue of her cherished
      schemes? And in this, how unlike she was to the rest of mankind! She
      thought so; she relied on her devout observances; they gave her sweet
      confidence, and the sense of being specially shielded even when specially
      menaced. Moreover, tell a woman to put back, when she is once clearly
      launched! Timid as she may be, her light bark bounds to meet the tempest.
      I speak of women who do launch: they are not numerous, but, to the wise,
      the minorities are the representatives.
    
    
      'Indeed, it is an intricate game!' said the Countess, at the conclusion of
      the squire's explanation, and leaned over to Mrs. Shorne to ask her if she
      thoroughly understood it.
    
    
      'Yes, I suppose I do,' was the reply; 'it       rather than the amusement
      they find in it.' This lady had recovered Mr. Parsley from Rose, but had
      only succeeded in making the curate unhappy, without satisfying herself.
    
    
      The Countess gave her the shrug of secret sympathy.
    
    
      'We must not say so,' she observed aloud       most artlessly, and fixed
      the squire with a bewitching smile, under which her heart beat thickly. As
      her eyes travelled from Mrs. Shorne to the squire, she had marked Lady
      Racial looking singularly at Evan, who was mounting the horse of Bob the
      groom.
    
    
      'Fine young fellow, that,' said the squire to Lady Racial, as Evan rode
      off with Rose.
    
    
      'An extremely handsome, well-bred young man,' she answered. Her eyes met
      the Countess's, and the Countess, after resting on their surface with an
      ephemeral pause, murmured: 'I must not praise my brother,' and smiled a
      smile which was meant to mean: 'I think with you, and thank you, and love
      you for admiring him.'
    
    
      Had Lady Racial joined the smile and spoken with animation afterwards, the
      Countess would have shuddered and had chills of dread. As it was, she was
      passably content. Lady Racial slightly dimpled her cheek, for courtesy's
      sake, and then looked gravely on the ground. This was no promise; it was
      even an indication (as the Countess read her), of something beyond
      suspicion in the lady's mind; but it was a sign of delicacy, and a sign
      that her feelings had been touched, from which a truce might be reckoned
      on, and no betrayal feared.
    
    
      She heard it said that the match was for honour and glory. A match of two
      days' duration under a broiling sun, all for honour and glory! Was it not
      enough to make her despise the games of men? For something better she
      played. Her game was for one hundred thousand pounds, the happiness of her
      brother, and the concealment of a horror. To win a game like that was
      worth the trouble. Whether she would have continued her efforts, had she
      known that the name of Evan Harrington was then blazing on a shop-front in
      Lymport, I cannot tell. The possessor of the name was in love, and did not
      reflect.
    
    
      Smiling adieu to the ladies, bowing to the gentlemen, and apprehending all
      the homage they would pour out to her condescending beauty when she had
      left them, the Countess's graceful hand gave the signal for Beckley.
    
    
      She stopped the coachman ere the wheels had rolled off the muffling turf,
      to enjoy one glimpse of Evan and Rose riding together, with the little
      maid on her pony in the rear. How suitable they seemed! how happy! She had
      brought them together after many difficulties       might it not be? It
      was surely a thing to be hoped for!
    
    
      Rose, galloping freshly, was saying to Evan: 'Why did you cut off your
      moustache?'
    
    
      He, neck and neck with her, replied: 'You complained of it in Portugal.'
    
    
      And she: 'Portugal's old times now to me       and I always love old
      times. I'm sorry! And, oh, Evan! did you really do it for me?'
    
    
      And really, just then, flying through the air, close to the darling of his
      heart, he had not the courage to spoil that delicious question, but
      dallying with the lie, he looked in her eyes lingeringly.
    
    
      This picture the Countess contemplated. Close to her carriage two young
      gentlemen-cricketers were strolling, while Fallow field gained breath to
      decide which men to send in first to the wickets.
    
    
      One of these stood suddenly on tiptoe, and pointing to the pair on
      horseback, cried, with the vivacity of astonishment:
    
    
      'Look there! do you see that? What the deuce is little Rosey doing with
      the tailor-fellow?'
    
    
      The Countess, though her cheeks were blanched, gazed calmly in
      Demogorgon's face, took a mental impression of the speaker, and again
      signalled for Beckley.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XIV. THE COUNTESS DESCRIBES THE FIELD OF ACTION
    
    
      Now, to clear up a point or two: You may think the Comic Muse is straining
      human nature rather toughly in making the Countess de Saldar rush
      open-eyed into the jaws of Demogorgon, dreadful to her. She has seen her
      brother pointed out unmistakeably as the tailor-fellow. There is yet time
      to cast him off or fly with him. Is it her extraordinary heroism impelling
      her onward, or infatuated rashness? or is it her mere animal love of
      conflict?
    
    
      The Countess de Saldar, like other adventurers, has her star. They who
      possess nothing on earth, have a right to claim a portion of the heavens.
      In resolute hands, much may be done with a star. As it has empires in its
      gift, so may it have heiresses. The Countess's star had not blinked
      balefully at her. That was one reason why she went straight on to Beckley.
    
    
      Again: the Countess was a born general. With her star above, with certain
      advantages secured, with battalions of lies disciplined and zealous, and
      with one clear prize in view, besides other undeveloped benefits dimly
      shadowing forth, the Countess threw herself headlong into the enemy's
      country.
    
    
      But, that you may not think too highly of this lady, I must add that the
      trivial reason was the exciting cause       as in many great enterprises.
      This was nothing more than the simple desire to be located, if but for a
      day or two, on the footing of her present rank, in the English
      country-house of an offshoot of our aristocracy. She who had moved in the
      first society of a foreign capital       who had married a Count, a
      minister of his sovereign, had enjoyed delicious high-bred badinage with
      refulgent ambassadors, could boast the friendship of duchesses, and had
      been the amiable receptacle of their pardonable follies; she who,
      moreover, heartily despised things English:       this lady experienced
      thrills of proud pleasure at the prospect of being welcomed at a
      third-rate English mansion. But then, that mansion was Beckley Court. We
      return to our first ambitions, as to our first loves not that they are
      dearer to us,       quit that delusion: our ripened loves and mature
      ambitions are probably closest to our hearts, as they deserve to be       but
      we return to them because our youth has a hold on us which it asserts
      whenever a disappointment knocks us down. Our old loves (with the bad
      natures I know in them) are always lurking to avenge themselves on the new
      by tempting us to a little retrograde infidelity. A schoolgirl in Fallow
      field, the tailor's daughter, had sighed for the bliss of Beckley Court.
      Beckley Court was her Elysium ere the ardent feminine brain conceived a
      loftier summit. Fallen from that attained eminence, she sighed anew for
      Beckley Court. Nor was this mere spiritual longing; it had its material
      side. At Beckley Court she could feel her foreign rank. Moving with our
      nobility as an equal, she could feel that the short dazzling glitter of
      her career was not illusory, and had left her something solid; not coin of
      the realm exactly, but yet gold. She could not feel this in the Cogglesby
      saloons, among pitiable bourgeoises       middle-class people daily soiled
      by the touch of tradesmen. They dragged her down. Their very homage was a
      mockery.
    
    
      Let the Countess have due credit for still allowing Evan to visit Beckley
      Court to follow up his chance. If Demogorgon betrayed her there, the Count
      was her protector: a woman rises to her husband. But a man is what he is,
      and must stand upon that. She was positive Evan had committed himself in
      some manner. As it did not suit her to think so, she at once encouraged an
      imaginary conversation, in which she took the argument that it was quite
      impossible Evan could have been so mad, and others instanced his youth,
      his wrongheaded perversity, his ungenerous disregard for his devoted
      sister, and his known weakness: she replying, that undoubtedly they were
      right so far: but that he could not have said he himself was that horrible
      thing, because he was nothing of the sort: which faith in Evan's stedfast
      adherence to facts, ultimately silenced the phantom opposition, and gained
      the day.
    
    
      With admiration let us behold the Countess de Saldar alighting on the
      gravel sweep of Beckley Court, the footman and butler of the enemy bowing
      obsequious welcome to the most potent visitor Beckley Court has ever yet
      embraced.
    
    
      The despatches of a general being usually acknowledged to be the safest
      sources from which the historian of a campaign can draw, I proceed to set
      forth a letter of the Countess de Saldar, forwarded to her sister, Harriet
      Cogglesby, three mornings after her arrival at Beckley Court; and which,
      if it should prove false in a few particulars, does nevertheless let us
      into the state of the Countess's mind, and gives the result of that
      general's first inspection of the field of action. The Countess's
      epistolary English does small credit to her Fallow field education; but it
      is feminine, and flows more than her ordinary speech. Besides, leaders of
      men have always notoriously been above the honours of grammar. 'MY DEAREST
      HARRIET,
    
    
      'Your note awaited me. No sooner my name announced, than servitors in
      yellow livery, with powder and buckles started before me, and bowing one
      presented it on a salver. A venerable butler       most impressive! led
      the way. In future, my dear, let it be de Saldar de Sancorvo. That is our
      title by rights, and it may as well be so in England. English Countess is
      certainly best. Always put the de. But let us be systematic, as my poor
      Silva says. He would be in the way here, and had better not come till I
      see something he can do. Silva has great reliance upon me. The farther he
      is from Lymport, my dear!       and imagine me, Harriet, driving through
      Fallow field to Beckley Court! I gave one peep at Dubbins's, as I passed.
      The school still goes on. I saw three little girls skipping, and the old
      swing-pole. SEMINARY FOR YOUNG LADIES as bright as ever! I should have
      liked to have kissed the children and given them bonbons and a holiday.
    
    
      'How sparing you English are of your crests and arms! I fully expected to
      see the Jocelyns' over my bed; but no       four posts totally without
      ornament! Sleep, indeed, must be the result of dire fatigue in such a bed.
      The Jocelyn crest is a hawk in jesses. The Elburne arms are, Or, three
      falcons on a field, vert. How heraldry reminds me of poor Papa! the

      is the third son of Lord Elburne, made a Baronet for his patriotic support
      of the Ministry in a time of great trouble. The people are sometimes
      grateful, my dear. Lord Elburne is the fourteenth of his line       originally
      simple country squires. They talk of the Roses, but we need not go so very
      far back as that. I do not quite understand why a Lord's son should
      condescend to a Baronetcy. Precedence of some sort for his lady, I
      suppose. I have yet to learn whether she ranks by his birth, or his
      present title. If so, a young Baronetcy cannot possibly be a gain. One
      thing is certain. She cares very little about it. She is most eccentric.
      But remember what I have told you. It will be serviceable when you are
      speaking of the family.
    
    
      'The dinner-hour, six. It would no doubt be full seven in Town. I am
      convinced you are half-an-hour too early. I had the post of honour to the
      right of Sir Franks. Evan to the right of Lady Jocelyn. Most fortunately
      he was in the best of spirits       quite brilliant. I saw the eyes of
      that sweet Rose glisten. On the other side of me sat my pet diplomatist,
      and I gave him one or two political secrets which astonished him. Of
      course, my dear, I was wheedled out of them. His contempt for our weak
      intellects is ineffable. But a woman must now and then ingratiate herself
      at the expense of her sex. This is perfectly legitimate. Tory policy at
      the table. The Opposition, as Andrew says, not represented. So to show
      that we were human beings, we differed among ourselves, and it soon became
      clear to me that Lady Jocelyn is the rankest of Radicals. My secret
      suspicion is, that she is a person of no birth whatever, wherever her
      money came from. A fine woman       yes; still to be admired, I suppose,
      by some kind of men; but totally wanting in the essentially feminine
      attractions.
    
    
      'There was no party, so to say. I will describe the people present,
      beginning with the insignifacants.
    
    
      'First, Mr. Parsley, the curate of Beckley. He eats everything at table,
      and agrees with everything. A most excellent orthodox young clergyman.
      Except that he was nearly choked by a fish-bone, and could not quite
      conceal his distress       and really Rose should have repressed her
      desire to laugh till the time for our retirement       he made no
      sensation. I saw her eyes watering, and she is not clever in turning it
      off. In that nobody ever equalled dear Papa. I attribute the attack almost
      entirely to the tightness of the white neck-cloths the young clergymen of
      the Established Church wear. But, my dear, I have lived too long away from
      them to wish for an instant the slightest change in anything they think,
      say, or do. The mere sight of this young man was most refreshing to my
      spirit. He may be the shepherd of a flock, this poor Mr. Parsley, but he
      is a sheep to one young person.
    
    
      'Mr. Drummond Forth. A great favourite of Lady Jocelyn's; an old friend.
      He went with them to the East. Nothing improper. She is too cold for that.
      He is fair, with regular features, very self-possessed, and ready       your
      English notions of gentlemanly. But none of your men treat a woman as a
      woman. We are either angels, or good fellows, or heaven knows what that is
      bad. No exquisite delicacy, no insinuating softness, mixed with respect,
      none of that hovering over the border, as Papa used to say, none of that
      happy indefiniteness of manner which seems to declare "I would love you if
      I might," or "I do, but I dare not tell," even when engaged in the most
      trivial attentions       handing a footstool, remarking on the soup, etc.
      You none of you know how to meet a woman's smile, or to engage her eyes
      without boldness       to slide off them, as it were, gracefully. Evan
      alone can look between the eyelids of a woman. I have had to correct him,
      for to me he quite exposes the state of his heart towards dearest Rose.
      She listens to Mr. Forth with evident esteem. In Portugal we do not
      understand young ladies having male friends.
    
    
      'Hamilton Jocelyn       all politics. The stiff Englishman. Not a shade of
      manners. He invited me to drink wine. Before I had finished my bow his
      glass was empty       the man was telling an anecdote of Lord Livelyston!
      You may be sure, my dear, I did not say I had seen his lordship.
    
    
      'Seymour Jocelyn, Colonel of Hussars. He did nothing but sigh for the cold
      weather, and hunting. All I envied him was his moustache for Evan. Will
      you believe that the ridiculous boy has shaved!
    
    
      'Then there is Melville, my dear diplomatist; and here is another instance
      of our Harrington luck. He has the gout in his right hand; he can only
      just hold knife and fork, and is interdicted Port-wine and penmanship. The
      dinner was not concluded before I had arranged that Evan should resume
      (gratuitously, you know) his post of secretary to him. So here is Evan
      fixed at Beckley Court as long as Melville stays. Talking of him, I am
      horrified suddenly. They call him the great Mel! 'Sir Franks is most
      estimable, I am sure, as a man, and redolent of excellent qualities       a
      beautiful disposition, very handsome. He has just as much and no more of
      the English polish one ordinarily meets. When he has given me soup or
      fish, bowed to me over wine, and asked a conventional question, he has
      done with me. I should imagine his opinions to be extremely good, for they
      are not a multitude.
    
    
      'Then his lady-but I have not grappled with her yet. Now for the women,
      for I quite class her with the opposite sex.
    
    
      'You must know that before I retired for the night, I induced Conning to
      think she had a bad head-ache, and Rose lent me her lady's-maid       they
      call the creature Polly. A terrible talker. She would tell all about the
      family. Rose has been speaking of Evan. It would have looked better had
      she been quiet       but then she is so English!'
    
    
      Here the Countess breaks off to say, that from where she is writing, she
      can see Rose and Evan walking out to the cypress avenue, and that no eyes
      are on them; great praise being given to the absence of suspicion in the
      Jocelyn nature.
    
    
      The communication is resumed the night of the same day.
    
    
      'Two days at Beckley Court are over, and that strange sensation I had of
      being an intruder escaped from Dubbins's, and expecting every instant the
      old schoolmistress to call for me, and expose me, and take me to the dark
      room, is quite vanished, and I feel quite at home, quite happy. Evan is
      behaving well. Quite the young nobleman. With the women I had no fear of
      him; he is really admirable with the men       easy, and talks of sport
      and politics, and makes the proper use of Portugal. He has quite won the
      heart of his sister. Heaven smiles on us, dearest Harriet!
    
    
      'We must be favoured, my dear, for Evan is very troublesome       distressingly
      inconsiderate! I left him for a day-remaining to comfort poor Mama       and
      on the road he picked up an object he had known at school, and this
      creature, in shameful garments, is seen in the field where Rose and Evan
      are riding       in a dreadful hat       Rose might well laugh at it!       he
      is seen running away from an old apple woman, whose fruit he had consumed
      without means to liquidate; but, of course, he rushes bolt up to Evan
      before all his grand company, and claims acquaintance, and Evan was base
      enough to acknowledge him! He disengaged himself so far well by tossing
      his purse to the wretch, but if he knows not how to       cut, I assure
      him it will be his ruin. Resolutely he must cast the dust off his shoes,
      or he will be dragged down to their level. By the way, as to hands and
      feet, comparing him with the Jocelyn men, he has every mark of better
      blood. Not a question about it. As Papa would say       We have Nature's
      proof.
    
    
      'Looking out on a beautiful lawn, and the moon, and all sorts of trees, I
      must now tell you about the ladies here.
    
    
      'Conning undid me to-night. While Conning remains unattached, Conning is
      likely to be serviceable. If Evan, would only give her a crumb, she would
      be his most faithful dog. I fear he cannot be induced, and Conning will be
      snapped up by somebody else. You know how susceptible she is behind her
      primness       she will be of no use on earth, and I shall find excuse to
      send her back immediately. After all, her appearance here was all that was
      wanted.
    
    
      'Mrs. Melville and her dreadful juvenile are here, as you may imagine       the
      complete Englishwoman. I smile on her, but I could laugh. To see the
      crow's-feet under her eyes on her white skin, and those ringlets, is
      really too ridiculous. Then there is a Miss Carrington, Lady Jocelyn's
      cousin, aged thirty-two       if she has not tampered with the register of
      her birth. I should think her equal to it. Between dark and fair. Always
      in love with some man, Conning tells me she hears. Rose's maid, Polly,
      hinted the same. She has a little money.
    
    
      'But my sympathies have been excited by a little cripple       a niece of
      Lady Jocelyn's and the favourite grand-daughter of the rich old Mrs.
      Bonner       also here       Juliana Bonner. Her age must be twenty. You
      would take her for ten. In spite of her immense expectations, the Jocelyns
      hate her. They can hardly be civil to her. It is the poor child's temper.
      She has already begun to watch dear Evan       certainly the handsomest of
      the men here as yet, though I grant you, they are well-grown men, these
      Jocelyns, for an untravelled Englishwoman. I fear, dear Harriet, we have
      been dreadfully deceived about Rose. The poor child has not, in her own
      right, much more than a tenth part of what we supposed, I fear. It was
      that Mrs. Melville. I have had occasion to notice her quiet boasts here.
      She said this morning, "when Mel is in the Ministry"       he is not yet
      in Parliament! I feel quite angry with the woman, and she is not so
      cordial as she might be. I have her profile very frequently while I am
      conversing with her.
    
    
      'With Grandmama Bonner I am excellent good friends,       venerable silver
      hair, high caps, etc. More of this most interesting Juliana Bonner
      by-and-by. It is clear to me that Rose's fortune is calculated upon the
      dear invalid's death! Is not that harrowing? It shocks me to think of it.
    
    
      'Then there is Mrs. Shorne. She is a Jocelyn       and such a history! She
      married a wealthy manufacturer       bartered her blood for his money, and
      he failed, and here she resides, a bankrupt widow, petitioning any man
      that may be willing for his love AND a decent home. AND       I say in
      charity.
    
    
      'Mrs. Shorne comes here to-morrow. She is at present with       guess, my
      dear!       with Lady Racial. Do not be alarmed. I have met Lady Racial.
      She heard Evan's name, and by that and the likeness I saw she knew at
      once, and I saw a truce in her eyes. She gave me a tacit assurance of it       she
      was engaged to dine here yesterday, and put it off       probably to grant
      us time for composure. If she comes I do not fear her. Besides, has she
      not reasons? Providence may have designed her for a staunch ally       I
      will not say, confederate.
    
    
      'Would that Providence had fixed this beautiful mansion five hundred miles
      from L              -, though it were in a desolate region! And that
      reminds me of the Madre. She is in health. She always will be
      overbearingly robust till the day we are bereft of her. There was some
      secret in the house when I was there, which I did not trouble to
      penetrate. That little Jane F              was there       not improved.
    
    
      'Pray, be firm about Torquay. Estates mortgaged, but hopes of saving a
      remnant of the property. Third son! Don't commit yourself there. We dare
      not baronetize him. You need not speak it       imply. More can be done
      that way.
    
    
      'And remember, dear Harriet, that you must manage Andrew so that we may
      positively promise his vote to the Ministry on all questions when
      Parliament next assembles. I understood from Lord Livelyston, that
      Andrew's vote would be thought much of. A most amusing nobleman! He
      pledged himself to nothing! But we are above such a thing as a commercial
      transaction. He must countenance Silva. Women, my dear, have sent out
      armies       why not fleets? Do not spare me your utmost aid in my
      extremity, my dearest sister.
    
    
      'As for Strike, I refuse to speak of him. He is insufferable and next to
      useless. How can one talk with any confidence of relationship with a Major
      of Marines? When I reflect on what he is, and his conduct to Caroline, I
      have inscrutable longings to slap his face. Tell dear Carry her husband's
      friend       the chairman or something of that wonderful company of
      Strike's       you know       the Duke of Belfield is coming here. He is a
      blood-relation of the Elburnes, therefore of the Jocelyns. It will not
      matter at all. Breweries, I find, are quite in esteem in your England. It
      was highly commendable in his Grace to visit you. Did he come to see the
      Major of Marines? Caroline is certainly the loveliest woman I ever beheld,
      and I forgive her now the pangs of jealousy she used to make me feel.
    
    
      'Andrew, I hope, has received the most kind invitations of the Jocelyns.
      He must come. Melville must talk with him about the votes of his
      abominable brother in Fallow field. We must elect Melville and have the
      family indebted to us. But pray be careful that Andrew speaks not a word
      to his odious brother about our location here. It would set him dead
      against these hospitable Jocelyns. It will perhaps be as well, dear
      Harriet, if you do not accompany Andrew. You would not be able to account
      for him quite thoroughly. Do as you like       I do but advise, and you
      know I may be trusted       for our sakes, dear one! I am working for
      Carry to come with Andrew. Beautiful women always welcome. A prodigy!       if
      they wish to astonish the Duke. Adieu! Heaven bless your babes!'
    
    
      The night passes, and the Countess pursues:
    
    
      'Awakened by your fresh note from a dream of Evan on horseback, and a
      multitude hailing him Count Jocelyn for Fallow field! A morning dream.
      They might desire that he should change his name; but "Count" is
      preposterous, though it may conceal something.
    
    
      'You say Andrew will come, and talk of his bringing Caroline. Anything to
      give our poor darling a respite from her brute. You deserve great credit
      for your managing of that dear little good-natured piece of obstinate man.
      I will at once see to prepare dear Caroline's welcome, and trust her stay
      may be prolonged in the interest of common humanity. They have her story
      here already.
    
    
      'Conning has come in, and says that young Mr. Harry Jocelyn will be here
      this morning from Fallow field, where he has been cricketing. The family
      have not spoken of him in my hearing. He is not, I think, in good odour at
      home       a scapegrace. Rose's maid, Polly, quite flew out when I
      happened to mention him, and broke one of my laces. These English maids
      are domesticated savage animals.
    
    
      'My chocolate is sent up, exquisitely concocted, in plate of the purest
      quality       lovely little silver cups! I have already quite set the
      fashion for the ladies to have chocolate in bed. The men, I hear, complain
      that there is no lady at the breakfast-table. They have Miss Carrington to
      superintend. I read, in the subdued satisfaction of her eyes (completely
      without colour), how much she thanks me and the institution of chocolate
      in bed. Poor Miss Carrington is no match for her opportunities. One may
      give them to her without dread.
    
    
      'It is ten on the Sabbath morn. The sweet churchbells are ringing. It
      seems like a dream. There is nothing but the religion attaches me to
      England; but that       is not that everything? How I used to sigh on
      Sundays to hear them in Portugal!
    
    
      'I have an idea of instituting toilette-receptions. They will not please
      Miss Carrington so well.
    
    
      'Now to the peaceful village church, and divine worship. Adieu, my dear. I
      kiss my fingers to Silva. Make no effort to amuse him. He is always
      occupied. Bread!       he asks no more. Adieu! Carry will be invited with
      your little man.... You unhappily unable.... She, the sister I pine to
      see, to show her worthy of my praises. Expectation and excitement! Adieu!'
    
    
      Filled with pleasing emotions at the thought of the service in the quiet
      village church, and worshipping in the principal pew, under the blazonry
      of the Jocelyn arms, the Countess sealed her letter and addressed it, and
      then examined the name of Cogglesby; which plebeian name, it struck her,
      would not sound well to the menials of Beckley Court. While she was
      deliberating what to do to conceal it, she heard, through her open window,
      the voices of some young men laughing. She beheld her brother pass these
      young men, and bow to them. She beheld them stare at him without at all
      returning his salute, and then one of them       the same who had filled
      her ears with venom at Fallow field       turned to the others and laughed
      outrageously, crying       
    
    
      'By Jove! this comes it strong. Fancy the snipocracy here       eh?'
    
    
      What the others said the Countess did not wait to hear. She put on her
      bonnet hastily, tried the effect of a peculiar smile in the mirror, and
      lightly ran down-stairs.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XV. A CAPTURE
    
    
      The three youths were standing in the portico when the Countess appeared
      among them. She singled out him who was specially obnoxious to her, and
      sweetly inquired the direction to the village post. With the renowned
      gallantry of his nation, he offered to accompany her, but presently, with
      a different exhibition of the same, proposed that they should spare
      themselves the trouble by dropping the letter she held prominently, in the
      bag.
    
    
      'Thanks,' murmured the Countess, 'I will go.' Upon which his eager air
      subsided, and he fell into an awkward silent march at her side, looking so
      like the victim he was to be, that the Countess could have emulated his
      power of laughter.
    
    
      'And you are Mr. Harry Jocelyn, the very famous cricketer?'
    
    
      He answered, glancing back at his friends, that he was, but did not know
      about the 'famous.'
    
    
      'Oh! but I saw you       I saw you hit the ball most beautifully, and
      dearly wished my brother had an equal ability. Brought up in the Court of
      Portugal, he is barely English. There they have no manly sports. You saw
      him pass you?'
    
    
      'Him! Who?' asked Harry.
    
    
      'My brother, on the lawn, this moment. Your sweet sister's friend. Your
      uncle Melville's secretary.'
    
    
      'What's his name?' said Harry, in blunt perplexity.
    
    
      The Countess repeated his name, which in her pronunciation was
      'Hawington,' adding, 'That was my brother. I am his sister. Have you heard
      of the Countess de Saldar?'
    
    
      'Countess!' muttered Harry. 'Dash it! here's a mistake.'
    
    
      She continued, with elegant fan-like motion of her gloved fingers: 'They
      say there is a likeness between us. The dear Queen of Portugal often
      remarked it, and in her it was a compliment to me, for she thought my
      brother a model! You I should have known from your extreme resemblance to
      your lovely young sister.'
    
    
      Coarse food, but then Harry was a youthful Englishman; and the Countess
      dieted the vanity according to the nationality. With good wine to wash it
      down, one can swallow anything. The Countess lent him her eyes for that
      purpose; eyes that had a liquid glow under the dove       like drooping
      lids. It was a principle of hers, pampering our poor sex with swinish
      solids or the lightest ambrosia, never to let the accompanying cordial be
      other than of the finest quality. She knew that clowns, even more than
      aristocrats, are flattered by the inebriation of delicate celestial
      liquors.
    
    
      'Now,' she said, after Harry had gulped as much of the dose as she chose
      to administer direct from the founts, 'you must accord me the favour to
      tell me all about yourself, for I have heard much of you, Mr. Harry
      Jocelyn, and you have excited my woman's interest. Of me you know
      nothing.'
    
    
      'Haven't I?' cried Harry, speaking to the pitch of his new warmth. 'My
      uncle Melville goes on about you tremendously       makes his wife as
      jealous as fire. How could I tell that was your brother?'
    
    
      'Your uncle has deigned to allude to me?' said the Countess, meditatively.
      'But not of him       of you, Mr. Harry! What does he say?'
    
    
      'Says you're so clever you ought to be a man.'
    
    
      'Ah! generous!' exclaimed the Countess. 'The idea, I think, is novel to
      him. Is it not?'
    
    
      'Well, I believe, from what I hear, he didn't back you for much over in
      Lisbon,' said veracious Harry.
    
    
      'I fear he is deceived in me now. I fear I am but a woman       I am not
      to be "backed." But you are not talking of yourself.'
    
    
      'Oh! never mind me,' was Harry's modest answer.
    
    
      'But I do. Try to imagine me as clever as a man, and talk to me of your
      doings. Indeed I will endeavour to comprehend you.'
    
    
      Thus humble, the Countess bade him give her his arm. He stuck it out with
      abrupt eagerness.
    
    
      'Not against my cheek.' She laughed forgivingly. 'And you need not start
      back half-a-mile,' she pursued with plain humour: 'and please do not look
      irresolute and awkward       It is not necessary,' she added. 'There!';
      and she settled her fingers on him, 'I am glad I can find one or two
      things to instruct you in. Begin. You are a great cricketer. What else?'
    
    
      Ay! what else? Harry might well say he had no wish to talk of himself. He
      did not know even how to give his arm to a lady! The first flattery and
      the subsequent chiding clashed in his elated soul, and caused him to deem
      himself one of the blest suddenly overhauled by an inspecting angel and
      found wanting: or, in his own more accurate style of reflection, 'What a
      rattling fine woman this is, and what a deuce of a fool she must think
      me!'
    
    
      The Countess leaned on his arm with dainty languor.
    
    
      'You walk well,' she said.
    
    
      Harry's backbone straightened immediately.
    
    
      'No, no; I do not want you to be a drill-sergeant. Can you not be told you
      are perfect without seeking to improve, vain boy? You can cricket, and you
      can walk, and will very soon learn how to give your arm to a lady. I have
      hopes of you. Of your friends, from whom I have ruthlessly dragged you, I
      have not much. Am I personally offensive to them, Mr. Harry? I saw them
      let my brother pass without returning his bow, and they in no way
      acknowledged my presence as I passed. Are they gentlemen?'
    
    
      'Yes,' said Harry, stupefied by the question. 'One 's Ferdinand Laxley,
      Lord Laxley's son, heir to the title; the other's William Harvey, son of
      the Chief Justice       both friends of mine.'
    
    
      'But not of your manners,' interposed the Countess. 'I have not so much
      compunction as I ought to have in divorcing you from your associates for a
      few minutes. I think I shall make a scholar of you in one or two
      essentials. You do want polish. Have I not a right to take you in hand? I
      have defended you already.'
    
    
      'Me?' cried Harry.
    
    
      'None other than Mr. Harry Jocelyn. Will he vouchsafe to me his pardon? It
      has been whispered in my ears that his ambition is to be the Don Juan of a
      country district, and I have said for him, that however grovelling his
      undirected tastes, he is too truly noble to plume himself upon the
      reputation they have procured him. Why did I defend you? Women, you know,
      do not shrink from Don Juans       even provincial Don Juans       as they
      should, perhaps, for their own sakes! You are all of you dangerous, if a
      woman is not strictly on her guard. But you will respect your champion,
      will you not?'
    
    
      Harry was about to reply with wonderful briskness. He stopped, and
      murmured boorishly that he was sure he was very much obliged.
    
    
      Command of countenance the Countess possessed in common with her sex.
      Those faces on which we make them depend entirely, women can entirely
      control. Keenly sensible to humour as the Countess was, her face sidled up
      to his immovably sweet. Harry looked, and looked away, and looked again.
      The poor fellow was so profoundly aware of his foolishness that he even
      doubted whether he was admired.
    
    
      The Countess trifled with his English nature; quietly watched him bob
      between tugging humility and airy conceit, and went on:
    
    
      'Yes! I will trust you, and that is saying very much, for what protection
      is a brother? I am alone here       defenceless!'
    
    
      Men, of course, grow virtuously zealous in an instant on behalf of the
      lovely dame who tells them bewitchingly, she is alone and defenceless,
      with pitiful dimples round the dewy mouth that entreats their guardianship
      and mercy!
    
    
      The provincial Don Juan found words       a sign of clearer sensations
      within. He said:
    
    
      'Upon my honour, I'd look after you better than fifty brothers!'
    
    
      The Countess eyed him softly, and then allowed herself the luxury of a
      laugh.
    
    
      'No, no! it is not the sheep, it is the wolf I fear.'
    
    
      And she went through a bit of the concluding portion of the drama of
      Little Red Riding Hood very prettily, and tickled him so that he became
      somewhat less afraid of her.
    
    
      'Are you truly so bad as report would have you to be, Mr. Harry?' she
      asked, not at all in the voice of a censor.
    
    
      'Pray don't think me       a       anything you wouldn't have me,' the
      youth stumbled into an apt response.
    
    
      'We shall see,' said the Countess, and varied her admiration for the noble
      creature beside her with gentle ejaculations on the beauty of the deer
      that ranged the park of Beckley Court, the grand old oaks and beeches, the
      clumps of flowering laurel, and the rich air swarming Summer.
    
    
      She swept out her arm. 'And this most magnificent estate will be yours?
      How happy will she be who is led hither to reside by you, Mr. Harry!'
    
    
      'Mine? No; there's the bother,' he answered, with unfeigned chagrin.
      'Beckley isn't Elburne property, you know. It belongs to old Mrs. Bonner,
      Rose's grandmama.'
    
    
      'Oh!' interjected the Countess, indifferently.
    
    
      'I shall never get it       no chance,' Harry pursued. 'Lost my luck with
      the old lady long ago.' He waxed excited on a subject that drew him from
      his shamefacedness. 'It goes to Juley Bonner, or to Rosey; it's a toss-up
      which. If I'd stuck up to Juley, I might have had a pretty fair chance.
      They wanted me to, that's why I scout the premises. But fancy Juley
      Bonner!'
    
    
      'You couldn't, upon your honour!' rhymed the Countess. (And Harry let
      loose a delighted 'Ha! ha!' as at a fine stroke of wit.) 'Are we enamoured
      of a beautiful maiden, Senor Harry?'
    
    
      'Not a bit,' he assured her eagerly. 'I don't know any girl. I don't care
      for 'em. I don't, really.'
    
    
      The Countess impressively declared to him that he must be guided by her;
      and that she might the better act his monitress, she desired to hear the
      pedigree of the estate, and the exact relations in which it at present
      stood toward the Elburne family.
    
    
      Glad of any theme he could speak on, Harry informed her that Beckley Court
      was bought by his grandfather Bonner from the proceeds of a successful oil
      speculation.
    
    
      'So we ain't much on that side,' he said.
    
    
      'Oil!' was the Countess's weary exclamation. 'I imagined Beckley Court to
      be your ancestral mansion. Oil!'
    
    
      Harry deprecatingly remarked that oil was money.
    
    
      'Yes,' she replied; 'but you are not one to mix oil with your Elburne
      blood. Let me see       oil! That, I conceive, is grocery. So, you are
      grocers on one side!'
    
    
      'Oh, come! hang it!' cried Harry, turning red.
    
    
      'Am I leaning on the grocer's side, or on the lord's?'
    
    
      Harry felt dreadfully taken down. 'One ranks with one's father,' he said.
    
    
      'Yes,' observed the Countess; 'but you should ever be careful not to
      expose the grocer. When I beheld my brother bow to you, and that your only
      return was to stare at him in that singular way, I was not aware of this,
      and could not account for it.'
    
    
      I declare I'm very sorry,' said Harry, with a nettled air. 'Do just let me
      tell you how it happened. We were at an inn, where there was an odd old
      fellow gave a supper; and there was your brother, and another fellow       as
      thorough an upstart as I ever met, and infernally impudent. He got
      drinking, and wanted to fight us. Now I see it! Your brother, to save his
      friend's bones, said he was a tailor! Of course no gentleman could fight a
      tailor; and it blew over with my saying we'd order our clothes of him.'
    
    
      'Said he was a       !' exclaimed the Countess, gazing blankly.
    
    
      'I don't wonder at your feeling annoyed,' returned Harry. 'I saw him with
      Rosey next day, and began to smell a rat then, but Laxley won't give up
      the tailor. He's as proud as Lucifer. He wanted to order a suit of your
      brother to-day; but I said       not while he's in the house, however he
      came here.'
    
    
      The Countess had partially recovered. They were now in the village street,
      and Harry pointed out the post-office.
    
    
      'Your divination with regard to my brother's most eccentric behaviour was
      doubtless correct,' she said. 'He wished to succour his wretched
      companion. Anywhere       it matters not to him what!       he allies
      himself with miserable mortals. He is the modern Samaritan. You should
      thank him for saving you an encounter with some low creature.'
    
    
      Swaying the letter to and fro, she pursued archly: 'I can read your
      thoughts. You are dying to know to whom this dear letter is addressed!'
    
    
      Instantly Harry, whose eyes had previously been quite empty of expression,
      glanced at the letter wistfully.
    
    
      Shall I tell you?'
    
    
      'Yes, do.'
    
    
      'It's to somebody I love.'
    
    
      'Are you in love then?' was his disconcerted rejoinder.
    
    
      'Am I not married?'
    
    
      'Yes; but every woman that's married isn't in love with her husband, you
      know.'
    
    
      'Oh! Don Juan of the provinces!' she cried, holding the seal of the letter
      before him in playful reproof. 'Fie!'
    
    
      'Come! who is it?' Harry burst out.
    
    
      'I am not, surely, obliged to confess my correspondence to you? Remember!'
      she laughed lightly. 'He already assumes the airs of a lord and master!
      You are rapid, Mr. Harry.'
    
    
      'Won't you really tell me?' he pleaded.
    
    
      She put a corner of the letter in the box. 'Must I?'
    
    
      All was done with the archest elegance: the bewildering condescension of a
      Goddess to a boor.
    
    
      'I don't say you must, you know: but I should like to see it,' returned
      Harry.
    
    
      'There!' She showed him a glimpse of 'Mrs.,' cleverly concealing plebeian
      'Cogglesby,' and the letter slid into darkness. 'Are you satisfied?'
    
    
      'Yes,' said Harry, wondering why he felt a relief at the sight of 'Mrs.'
      written on a letter by a lady he had only known half an hour.
    
    
      'And now,' said she, 'I shall demand a boon of you, Mr. Harry. Will it be
      accorded?'
    
    
      She was hurriedly told that she might count upon him for whatever she
      chose to ask; and after much trifling and many exaggerations of the boon
      in question, he heard that she had selected him as her cavalier for the
      day, and that he was to consent to accompany her to the village church.
    
    
      'Is it so great a request, the desire that you should sit beside a
      solitary lady for so short a space?' she asked, noting his rueful visage.
    
    
      Harry assured her he would be very happy, but hinted at the bother of
      having to sit and listen to that fool of a Parsley: again assuring her,
      and with real earnestness, which the lady now affected to doubt, that he
      would be extremely happy.
    
    
      'You know, I haven't been there for ages,' he explained.
    
    
      'I hear it!' she sighed, aware of the credit his escort would bring her in
      Beckley, and especially with Harry's grandmama Bonner.
    
    
      They went together to the village church. The Countess took care to be
      late, so that all eyes beheld her stately march up the aisle, with her
      captive beside her.
    
    
      Nor was her captive less happy than he professed he would be. Charming
      comic side-play, at the expense of Mr. Parsley, she mingled with exceeding
      devoutness, and a serious attention to Mr. Parsley's discourse. In her
      heart this lady really thought her confessed daily sins forgiven her by
      the recovery of the lost sheep to Mr. Parsley's fold. The results of this
      small passage of arms were, that Evan's disclosure at Fallow field was
      annulled in the mind of Harry Jocelyn, and the latter gentleman became the
      happy slave of the Countess de Saldar.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XVI. LEADS TO A SMALL SKIRMISH BETWEEN ROSE AND EVAN
    
    
      Lady Jocelyn belonged properly to that order which the Sultans and the
      Roxalanas of earth combine to exclude from their little games, under the
      designation of blues, or strong-minded women: a kind, if genuine, the
      least dangerous and staunchest of the sex, as poor fellows learn when the
      flippant and the frail fair have made mummies of them. She had the
      frankness of her daughter, the same direct eyes and firm step: a face
      without shadows, though no longer bright with youth. It may be charged to
      her as one of the errors of her strong mind, that she believed friendship
      practicable between men and women, young or old. She knew the world pretty
      well, and was not amazed by extraordinary accidents; but as she herself
      continued to be an example of her faith: we must presume it natural that
      her delusion should cling to her. She welcomed Evan as her daughter's
      friend, walked half-way across the room to meet him on his introduction to
      her, and with the simple words, 'I have heard of you,' let him see that he
      stood upon his merits in her house. The young man's spirit caught
      something of hers even in their first interview, and at once mounted to
      that level. Unconsciously he felt that she took, and would take him, for
      what he was, and he rose to his worth in the society she presided over. A
      youth like Evan could not perceive, that in loving this lady's daughter,
      and accepting the place she offered him, he was guilty of a breach of
      confidence; or reflect, that her entire absence of suspicion imposed upon
      him a corresponding honesty toward her. He fell into a blindness. Without
      dreaming for a moment that she designed to encourage his passion for Rose,
      he yet beheld himself in the light she had cast on him; and, received as
      her daughter's friend, it seemed to him not so utterly monstrous that he
      might be her daughter's lover. A haughty, a grand, or a too familiar
      manner, would have kept his eyes clearer on his true condition. Lady
      Jocelyn spoke to his secret nature, and eclipsed in his mind the outward
      aspects with which it was warring. To her he was a gallant young man, a
      fit companion for Rose, and when she and Sir Franks said, and showed him,
      that they were glad to know him, his heart swam in a flood of happiness
      they little suspected.
    
    
      This was another of the many forms of intoxication to which circumstances
      subjected the poor lover. In Fallow field, among impertinent young men,
      Evan's pride proclaimed him a tailor. At Beckley Court, acted on by one
      genuine soul, he forgot it, and felt elate in his manhood. The shades of
      Tailordom dispersed like fog before the full South-west breeze. When I say
      he forgot it, the fact was present enough to him, but it became an outward
      fact: he had ceased to feel it within him. It was not a portion of his
      being, hard as Mrs. Mel had struck to fix it. Consequently, though he was
      in a far worse plight than when he parted with Rose on board the Jocasta,
      he felt much less of an impostor now. This may have been partly because he
      had endured his struggle with the Demogorgon the Countess painted to him
      in such frightful colours, and found him human after all; but it was
      mainly owing to the hearty welcome Lady Jocelyn had extended to him as the
      friend of Rose.
    
    
      Loving Rose, he nevertheless allowed his love no tender liberties. The
      eyes of a lover are not his own; but his hands and lips are, till such
      time as they are claimed. The sun must smile on us with peculiar warmth to
      woo us forth utterly-pluck our hearts out. Rose smiled on many. She smiled
      on Drummond Forth, Ferdinand Laxley, William Harvey, and her brother
      Harry; and she had the same eyes for all ages. Once, previous to the
      arrival of the latter three, there was a change in her look, or Evan
      fancied it. They were going to ride out together, and Evan, coming to his
      horse on the gravel walk, saw her talking with Drummond Forth. He mounted,
      awaiting her, and either from a slight twinge of jealousy, or to mark her
      dainty tread with her riding-habit drawn above her heels, he could not
      help turning his head occasionally. She listened to Drummond with
      attention, but presently broke from him, crying: 'It's an absurdity. Speak
      to them yourself       I shall not.'
    
    
      On the ride that day, she began prattling of this and that with the
      careless glee that became her well, and then sank into a reverie.
      Between-whiles her eyes had raised tumults in Evan's breast by dropping on
      him in a sort of questioning way, as if she wished him to speak, or wished
      to fathom something she would rather have unspoken. Ere they had finished
      their ride, she tossed off what burden may have been on her mind as
      lightly as a stray lock from her shoulders. He thought that the singular
      look recurred. It charmed him too much for him to speculate on it.
    
    
      The Countess's opportune ally, the gout, which had reduced the Hon.
      Melville Jocelyn's right hand to a state of uselessness, served her with
      her brother equally: for, having volunteered his services to the invalided
      diplomatist, it excused his stay at Beckley Court to himself, and was a
      mask to his intimacy with Rose, besides earning him the thanks of the
      family. Harry Jocelyn, released from the wing of the Countess, came
      straight to him, and in a rough kind of way begged Evan to overlook his
      rudeness.
    
    
      'You took us all in at Fallow field, except Drummond,' he said. 'Drummond
      would have it you were joking. I see it now. And you're a confoundedly
      clever fellow into the bargain, or you wouldn't be quill-driving for Uncle
      Mel. Don't be uppish about it       will you?'
    
    
      'You have nothing to fear on that point,' said Evan. With which promise
      the peace was signed between them. Drummond and William Harvey were
      cordial, and just laughed over the incident. Laxley, however, held aloof.
      His retention of ideas once formed befitted his rank and station. Some
      trifling qualms attended Evan's labours with the diplomatist; but these
      were merely occasioned by the iteration of a particular phrase. Mr. Goren,
      an enthusiastic tailor, had now and then thrown out to Evan stirring hints
      of an invention he claimed: the discovery of a Balance in Breeches:
      apparently the philosopher's stone of the tailor craft, a secret that
      should ensure harmony of outline to the person and an indubitable
      accommodation to the most difficult legs.
    
    
      Since Adam's expulsion, it seemed, the tailors of this wilderness had been
      in search of it. But like the doctors of this wilderness, their science
      knew no specific: like the Babylonian workmen smitten with confusion of
      tongues, they had but one word in common, and that word was 'cut.' Mr.
      Goren contended that to cut was not the key of the science: but to find a
      Balance was. An artistic admirer of the frame of man, Mr. Goren was not
      wanting in veneration for the individual who had arisen to do it justice.
      He spoke of his Balance with supreme self-appreciation. Nor less so the
      Honourable Melville, who professed to have discovered the Balance of
      Power, at home and abroad. It was a capital Balance, but inferior to Mr.
      Goren's. The latter gentleman guaranteed a Balance with motion: whereas
      one step not only upset the Honourable Melville's, but shattered the limbs
      of Europe. Let us admit, that it is easier to fit a man's legs than to
      compress expansive empires.
    
    
      Evan enjoyed the doctoring of kingdoms quite as well as the diplomatist.
      It suited the latent grandeur of soul inherited by him from the great Mel.
      He liked to prop Austria and arrest the Czar, and keep a watchful eye on
      France; but the Honourable Melville's deep-mouthed phrase conjured up to
      him a pair of colossal legs imperiously demanding their Balance likewise.
      At first the image scared him. In time he was enabled to smile it into
      phantom vagueness. The diplomatist diplomatically informed him, it might
      happen that the labours he had undertaken might be neither more nor less
      than education for a profession he might have to follow. Out of this, an
      ardent imagination, with the Countess de Saldar for an interpreter, might
      construe a promise of some sort. Evan soon had high hopes. What though his
      name blazed on a shop-front? The sun might yet illumine him to honour!
    
    
      Where a young man is getting into delicate relations with a young woman,
      the more of his sex the better       they serve as a blind; and the
      Countess hailed fresh arrivals warmly. There was Sir John Loring,
      Dorothy's father, who had married the eldest of the daughters of Lord
      Elburne. A widower, handsome, and a flirt, he capitulated to the Countess
      instantly, and was played off against the provincial Don Juan, who had
      reached that point with her when youths of his description make bashful
      confidences of their successes, and receive delicious chidings for their
      naughtiness       rebukes which give immeasurable rebounds. Then came Mr.
      Gordon Graine, with his daughter, Miss Jenny Graine, an early friend of
      Rose's, and numerous others. For the present, Miss Isabella Current need
      only be chronicled among the visitors       a sprightly maid fifty years
      old, without a wrinkle to show for it       the Aunt Bel of fifty houses
      where there were young women and little boys. Aunt Bel had quick wit and
      capital anecdotes, and tripped them out aptly on a sparkling tongue with
      exquisite instinct for climax and when to strike for a laugh. No sooner
      had she entered the hall than she announced the proximate arrival of the
      Duke of Belfield at her heels, and it was known that his Grace was as sure
      to follow as her little dog, who was far better paid for his devotion.
    
    
      The dinners at Beckley Court had hitherto been rather languid to those who
      were not intriguing or mixing young love with the repast. Miss Current was
      an admirable neutral, sent, as the Countess fervently believed, by
      Providence. Till now the Countess had drawn upon her own resources to
      amuse the company, and she had been obliged to restrain herself from doing
      it with that unctuous feeling for rank which warmed her Portuguese
      sketches in low society and among her sisters. She retired before Miss
      Current and formed audience, glad of a relief to her inventive labour.
      While Miss Current and her ephemerals lightly skimmed the surface of human
      life, the Countess worked in the depths. Vanities, passions, prejudices
      beneath the surface, gave her full employment. How naturally poor Juliana
      Bonner was moved to mistake Evan's compassion for a stronger sentiment!
      The Countess eagerly assisted Providence to shuffle the company into their
      proper places. Harry Jocelyn was moodily happy, but good; greatly improved
      in the eyes of his grandmama Bonner, who attributed the change to the
      Countess, and partly forgave her the sinful consent to the conditions of
      her love-match with the foreign Count, which his penitent wife had
      privately confessed to that strict Churchwoman.
    
    
      'Thank Heaven that you have no children,' Mrs. Bonner had said; and the
      Countess humbly replied:
    
    
      'It is indeed my remorseful consolation!'
    
    
      'Who knows that it is not your punishment?' added Mrs. Bonner; the
      Countess weeping.
    
    
      She went and attended morning prayers in Mrs. Bonner's apartments, alone
      with the old lady. 'To make up for lost time in Catholic Portugal!' she
      explained it to the household.
    
    
      On the morning after Miss Current had come to shape the party, most of the
      inmates of Beckley Court being at breakfast, Rose gave a lead to the
      conversation.
    
    
      'Aunt Bel! I want to ask you something. We've been making bets about you.
      Now, answer honestly, we're all friends. Why did you refuse all your
      offers?'
    
    
      'Quite simple, child,' replied the unabashed ex-beauty.
    
    
      'A matter of taste. I liked twenty shillings better than a sovereign.'
    
    
      Rose looked puzzled, but the men laughed, and Rose exclaimed:
    
    
      'Now I see! How stupid I am! You mean, you may have friends when you are
      not married. Well, I think that's the wisest, after all. You don't lose
      them, do you? Pray, Mr. Evan, are you thinking Aunt Bel might still alter
      her mind for somebody, if she knew his value?'
    
    
      'I was presuming to hope there might be a place vacant among the twenty,'
      said Evan, slightly bowing to both. 'Am I pardoned?'
    
    
      'I like you!' returned Aunt Bel, nodding at him. 'Where do you come from?
      A young man who'll let himself go for small coin's a jewel worth knowing.'
    
    
      'Where do I come from?' drawled Laxley, who had been tapping an egg with a
      dreary expression.
    
    
      'Aunt Bel spoke to Mr. Harrington,' said Rose, pettishly.
    
    
      'Asked him where he came from,' Laxley continued his drawl. 'He didn't
      answer, so I thought it polite for another of the twenty to strike in.'
    
    
      'I must thank you expressly,' said Evan, and achieved a cordial bow.
    
    
      Rose gave Evan one of her bright looks, and then called the attention of
      Ferdinand Laxley to the fact that he had lost a particular bet made among
      them.
    
    
      'What bet?' asked Laxley. 'About the profession?'
    
    
      A stream of colour shot over Rose's face. Her eyes flew nervously from
      Laxley to Evan, and then to Drummond. Laxley appeared pleased as a man who
      has made a witty sally: Evan was outwardly calm, while Drummond replied to
      the mute appeal of Rose, by saying:
    
    
      'Yes; we've all lost. But who could hit it? The lady admits no sovereign
      in our sex.'
    
    
      'So you've been betting about me?' said Aunt Bel. 'I 'll settle the
      dispute. Let him who guessed "Latin" pocket the stakes, and, if I guess
      him, let him hand them over to me.'
    
    
      'Excellent!' cried Rose. 'One did guess "Latin," Aunt Bel! Now, tell us
      which one it was.'
    
    
      'Not you, my dear. You guessed "temper."'
    
    
      'No! you dreadful Aunt Bel!'
    
    
      'Let me see,' said Aunt Bel, seriously. 'A young man would not marry a
      woman with Latin, but would not guess it the impediment. Gentlemen
      moderately aged are mad enough to slip their heads under any yoke, but see
      the obstruction. It was a man of forty guessed "Latin." I request the Hon.
      Hamilton Everard Jocelyn to confirm it.'
    
    
      Amid laughter and exclamations Hamilton confessed himself the man who had
      guessed Latin to be the cause of Miss Current's remaining an old maid;
      Rose, crying:
    
    
      'You really are too clever, Aunt Bel!'
    
    
      A divergence to other themes ensued, and then Miss Jenny Graine said:
      'Isn't Juley learning Latin? I should like to join her while I'm here.'
    
    
      'And so should I,' responded Rose. 'My friend Evan is teaching her during
      the intervals of his arduous diplomatic labours. Will you take us into
      your class, Evan?'
    
    
      'Don't be silly, girls,' interposed Aunt Bel. 'Do you want to graduate for
      my state with your eyes open?'
    
    
      Evan objected his poor qualifications as a tutor, and Aunt Bel remarked,
      that if Juley learnt Latin at all, she should have regular instruction.
    
    
      'I am quite satisfied,' said Juley, quietly.
    
    
      'Of course you are,' Rose snubbed her cousin. 'So would anybody be. But
      Mama really was talking of a tutor for Juley, if she could find one.
      There's a school at Bodley; but that's too far for one of the men to come
      over.'
    
    
      A school at Bodley! thought Evan, and his probationary years at the
      Cudford Establishment rose before him; and therewith, for the first time
      since his residence at Beckley, the figure of John Raikes.
    
    
      'There's a friend of mine,' he said, aloud, 'I think if Lady Jocelyn does
      wish Miss Bonner to learn Latin thoroughly, he would do very well for the
      groundwork and would be glad of the employment. He is very poor.'
    
    
      'If he's poor, and a friend of yours, Evan, we'll have him,' said Rose:
      'we'll ride and fetch him.'
    
    
      'Yes,' added Miss Carrington, 'that must be quite sufficient
      qualification.'
    
    
      Juliana was not gazing gratefully at Evan for his proposal.
    
    
      Rose asked the name of Evan's friend. 'His name is Raikes,' answered Evan.
      'I don't know where he is now. He may be at Fallow field. If Lady Jocelyn
      pleases, I will ride over to-day and see.'
    
    
      'My dear Evan!' cried Rose, 'you don't mean that absurd figure we saw on
      the cricket-field?' She burst out laughing. 'Oh! what fun it will be! Let
      us have him here by all means.'
    
    
      'I shall not bring him to be laughed at,' said Evan.
    
    
      'I will remember he is your friend,' Rose returned demurely; and again
      laughed, as she related to Jenny Graine the comic appearance Mr. Raikes
      had presented.
    
    
      Laxley waited for a pause, and then said: 'I have met this Mr. Raikes. As
      a friend of the family, I should protest against his admission here in any
      office whatever into the upper part of the house, at least. He is not a
      gentleman.'
    
    
      We don't want teachers to be gentlemen,' observed Rose.
    
    
      'This fellow is the reverse,' Laxley pronounced, and desired Harry to
      confirm it; but Harry took a gulp of coffee.
    
    
      'Oblige me by recollecting that I have called him a friend of mine,' said
      Evan.
    
    
      Rose murmured to him: 'Pray forgive me! I forgot.' Laxley hummed something
      about 'taste.' Aunt Bel led from the theme by a lively anecdote.
    
    
      After breakfast the party broke into knots, and canvassed Laxley's
      behaviour to Evan, which was generally condemned. Rose met the young men
      strolling on the lawn; and, with her usual bluntness, accused Laxley of
      wishing to insult her friend.
    
    
      'I speak to him       do I not?' said Laxley. 'What would you have more? I
      admit the obligation of speaking to him when I meet him in your house. Out
      of it       that 's another matter.'
    
    
      'But what is the cause for your conduct to him, Ferdinand?'
    
    
      'By Jove!' cried Harry, 'I wonder he puts up with it I wouldn't. I'd have
      a shot with you, my boy.'
    
    
      'Extremely honoured,' said Laxley. 'But neither you nor I care to fight
      tailors.'
    
    
      'Tailors!' exclaimed Rose. There was a sharp twitch in her body, as if she
      had been stung or struck.
    
    
      'Look here, Rose,' said Laxley; 'I meet him, he insults me, and to get out
      of the consequences tells me he's the son of a tailor, and a tailor
      himself; knowing that it ties my hands. Very well, he puts himself hors de
      combat to save his bones. Let him unsay it, and choose whether he 'll
      apologize or not, and I'll treat him accordingly. At present I'm not bound
      to do more than respect the house I find he has somehow got admission to.'
    
    
      'It's clear it was that other fellow,' said Harry, casting a side-glance
      up at the Countess's window.
    
    
      Rose looked straight at Laxley, and abruptly turned on her heel.
    
    
      In the afternoon, Lady Jocelyn sent a message to Evan that she wished to
      see him. Rose was with her mother. Lady Jocelyn had only to say, that if
      he thought his friend a suitable tutor for Miss Bonner, they would be
      happy to give him the office at Beckley Court. Glad to befriend poor Jack,
      Evan gave the needful assurances, and was requested to go and fetch him
      forthwith. When he left the room, Rose marched out silently beside him.
    
    
      'Will you ride over with me, Rose?' he said, though scarcely anxious that
      she should see Mr. Raikes immediately.
    
    
      The singular sharpness of her refusal astonished him none the less.
    
    
      'Thank you, no; I would rather not.'
    
    
      A lover is ever ready to suspect that water has been thrown on the fire
      that burns for him in the bosom of his darling. Sudden as the change was,
      it was very decided. His sensitive ears were pained by the absence of his
      Christian name, which her lips had lavishly made sweet to him. He stopped
      in his walk.
    
    
      'You spoke of riding to Fallow field. Is it possible you don't want me to
      bring my friend here? There's time to prevent it.'
    
    
      Judged by the Countess de Saldar, the behaviour of this well-born English
      maid was anything but well-bred. She absolutely shrugged her shoulders and
      marched a-head of him into the conservatory, where she began smelling at
      flowers and plucking off sere leaves.
    
    
      In such cases a young man always follows; as her womanly instinct must
      have told her, for she expressed no surprise when she heard his voice two
      minutes after.
    
    
      'Rose! what have I done?'
    
    
      'Nothing at all,' she said, sweeping her eyes over his a moment, and
      resting them on the plants.
    
    
      'I must have uttered something that has displeased you.'
    
    
      'No.'
    
    
      Brief negatives are not re-assuring to a lover's uneasy mind.
    
    
      'I beg you       Be frank with me, Rose!'
    
    
      A flame of the vanished fire shone in her face, but subsided, and she
      shook her head darkly.
    
    
      'Have you any objection to my friend?'
    
    
      Her fingers grew petulant with an orange leaf. Eyeing a spot on it, she
      said, hesitatingly:
    
    
      'Any friend of yours I am sure I should like to help. But       but I wish
      you wouldn't associate with that       that kind of friend. It gives
      people all sorts of suspicions.'
    
    
      Evan drew a sharp breath.
    
    
      The voices of Master Alec and Miss Dorothy were heard shouting on the
      lawn. Alec gave Dorothy the slip and approached the conservatory on
      tip-toe, holding his hand out behind him to enjoin silence and secrecy.
      The pair could witness the scene through the glass before Evan spoke.
    
    
      'What suspicions?' he asked.
    
    
      Rose looked up, as if the harshness of his tone pleased her.
    
    
      'Do you like red roses best, or white?' was her answer, moving to a couple
      of trees in pots.
    
    
      'Can't make up your mind?' she continued, and plucked both a white and red
      rose, saying: 'There! choose your colour by-and-by,' and ask Juley to sew
      the one you choose in your button-hole.'
    
    
      She laid the roses in his hand, and walked away. She must have known that
      there was a burden of speech on his tongue. She saw him move to follow
      her, but this time she did not linger, and it may be inferred that she
      wished to hear no more.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XVII. IN WHICH EVAN WRITES HIMSELF TAILOR
    
    
      The only philosophic method of discovering what a young woman means, and
      what is in her mind, is that zigzag process of inquiry conducted by
      following her actions, for she can tell you nothing, and if she does not
      want to know a particular matter, it must be a strong beam from the
      central system of facts that shall penetrate her. Clearly there was a
      disturbance in the bosom of Rose Jocelyn, and one might fancy that amiable
      mirror as being wilfully ruffled to confuse a thing it was asked by the
      heavens to reflect: a good fight fought by all young people at a certain
      period, and now and then by an old fool or two. The young it seasons and
      strengthens; the old it happily kills off; and thus, what is, is made to
      work harmoniously with what we would have be.
    
    
      After quitting Evan, Rose hied to her friend Jenny Graine, and in the
      midst of sweet millinery talk, darted the odd question, whether baronets
      or knights ever were tradesmen: to which Scottish Jenny, entirely putting
      aside the shades of beatified aldermen and the illustrious list of mayors
      that have welcomed royalty, replied that it was a thing quite impossible.
      Rose then wished to know if tailors were thought worse of than other
      tradesmen. Jenny, premising that she was no authority, stated she imagined
      she had heard that they were.
    
    
      'Why?' said Rose, no doubt because she was desirous of seeing justice
      dealt to that class. But Jenny's bosom was a smooth reflector of facts
      alone.
    
    
      Rose pondered, and said with compressed eagerness, 'Jenny, do you think
      you could ever bring yourself to consent to care at all for anybody ever
      talked of as belonging to them? Tell me.'
    
    
      Now Jenny had come to Beckley Court to meet William Harvey: she was
      therefore sufficiently soft to think she could care for him whatever his
      origin were, and composed in the knowledge that no natal stigma was upon
      him to try the strength of her affection. Designing to generalize, as
      women do (and seem tempted to do most when they are secretly speaking from
      their own emotions), she said, shyly moving her shoulders, with a
      forefinger laying down the principle:
    
    
      'You know, my dear, if one esteemed such a person very very much, and were
      quite sure, without any doubt, that he liked you in return       that is,
      completely liked you, and was quite devoted, and made no concealment       I
      mean, if he was very superior, and like other men       you know what I
      mean       and had none of the cringing ways some of them have       I
      mean; supposing him gay and handsome, taking       '
    
    
      'Just like William,' Rose cut her short; and we may guess her to have had
      some one in her head for her to conceive that Jenny must be speaking of
      any one in particular.
    
    
      A young lady who can have male friends, as well as friends of her own sex,
      is not usually pressing and secret in her confidences, possibly because
      such a young lady is not always nursing baby-passions, and does not
      require her sex's coddling and posseting to keep them alive. With Rose
      love will be full grown when it is once avowed, and will know where to go
      to be nourished.
    
    
      'Merely an idea I had,' she said to Jenny, who betrayed her mental
      pre-occupation by putting the question for the questions last.
    
    
      Her Uncle Melville next received a visit from the restless young woman. To
      him she spoke not a word of the inferior classes, but as a special
      favourite of the diplomatist's, begged a gift of him for her proximate
      birthday. Pushed to explain what it was, she said, 'It's something I want
      you to do for a friend of mine, Uncle Mel.'
    
    
      The diplomatist instanced a few of the modest requests little maids prefer
      to people they presume to have power to grant.
    
    
      'No, it's nothing nonsensical,' said Rose; 'I want you to get my friend
      Evan an appointment. You can if you like, you know, Uncle Mel, and it's a
      shame to make him lose his time when he's young and does his work so well       that
      you can't deny! Now, please, be positive, Uncle Mel. You know I hate       I
      have no faith in your 'nous verrons'. Say you will, and at once.'
    
    
      The diplomatist pretended to have his weather-eye awakened.
    
    
      'You seem very anxious about feathering the young fellow's nest, Rosey?'
    
    
      'There,' cried Rose, with the maiden's mature experience of us, 'isn't
      that just like men? They never can believe you can be entirely
      disinterested!'
    
    
      'Hulloa!' the diplomatist sung out, 'I didn't say anything, Rosey.'
    
    
      She reddened at her hastiness, but retrieved it by saying:
    
    
      'No, but you listen to your wife; you know you do, Uncle Mel; and now
      there's Aunt Shorne and the other women, who make you think just what they
      like about me, because they hate Mama.'
    
    
      'Don't use strong words, my dear.'
    
    
      'But it's abominable!' cried Rose. 'They asked Mama yesterday what Evan's
      being here meant? Why, of course, he's your secretary, and my friend, and
      Mama very properly stopped them, and so will I! As for me, I intend to
      stay at Beckley, I can tell you, dear old boy.' Uncle Mel had a soft arm
      round his neck, and was being fondled. 'And I 'm not going to be bred up
      to go into a harem, you may be sure.'
    
    
      The diplomatist whistled, 'You talk your mother with a vengeance, Rosey.'
    
    
      'And she's the only sensible woman I know,' said Rose. 'Now promise me       in
      earnest. Don't let them mislead you, for you know you're quite a child,
      out of your politics, and I shall take you in hand myself. Why, now,
      think, Uncle Mel! wouldn't any girl, as silly as they make me out, hold
      her tongue       not talk of him, as I do; and because I really do feel
      for him as a friend. See the difference between me and Juley!'
    
    
      It was a sad sign if Rose was growing a bit of a hypocrite, but this
      instance of Juliana's different manner of showing her feelings toward Evan
      would have quieted suspicion in shrewder men, for Juliana watched Evan's
      shadow, and it was thought by two or three at Beckley Court, that Evan
      would be conferring a benefit on all by carrying off the
      romantically-inclined but little presentable young lady.
    
    
      The diplomatist, with a placid 'Well, well!' ultimately promised to do his
      best for Rose's friend, and then Rose said, 'Now I leave you to the
      Countess,' and went and sat with her mother and Drummond Forth. The latter
      was strange in his conduct to Evan. While blaming Laxley's unmannered
      behaviour, he seemed to think Laxley had grounds for it, and treated Evan
      with a sort of cynical deference that had, for the last couple of days,
      exasperated Rose.
    
    
      'Mama, you must speak to Ferdinand,' she burst upon the conversation,
      'Drummond is afraid to       he can stand by and see my friend insulted.
      Ferdinand is insufferable with his pride       he's jealous of everybody
      who has manners, and Drummond approves him, and I will not bear it.'
    
    
      Lady Jocelyn hated household worries, and quietly remarked that the young
      men must fight it out together.
    
    
      'No, but it's your duty to interfere, Mama,' said Rose; 'and I know you
      will when I tell you that Ferdinand declares my friend Evan is a tradesman       beneath
      his notice. Why, it insults me!'
    
    
      Lady Jocelyn looked out from a lofty window on such veritable squabbles of
      boys and girls as Rose revealed.
    
    
      'Can't you help them to run on smoothly while they're here?' she said to
      Drummond, and he related the scene at the Green Dragon.
    
    
      'I think I heard he was the son of Sir Something Harrington, Devonshire
      people,' said Lady Jocelyn.
    
    
      'Yes, he is,' cried Rose, 'or closely related. I'm sure I understood the
      Countess that it was so. She brought the paper with the death in it to us
      in London, and shed tears over it.'
    
    
      'She showed it in the paper, and shed tears over it?' said Drummond,
      repressing an inclination to laugh. 'Was her father's title given in
      full?'
    
    
      'Sir Abraham Harrington, replied Rose. 'I think she said father, if the
      word wasn't too common-place for her.'
    
    
      'You can ask old Tom when he comes, if you are anxious to know,' said
      Drummond to her ladyship. 'His brother married one of the sisters. By the
      way, he's coming, too. He ought to clear up the mystery.'
    
    
      'Now you're sneering, Drummond,' said Rose: 'for you know there 's no
      mystery to clear up.'
    
    
      Drummond and Lady Jocelyn began talking of old Tom Cogglesby, whom, it
      appeared, the former knew intimately, and the latter had known.
    
    
      'The Cogglesbys are sons of a cobbler, Rose,' said Lady Jocelyn. 'You must
      try and be civil to them.'
    
    
      'Of course I shall, Mama,' Rose answered seriously.
    
    
      'And help the poor Countess to bear their presence as well as possible,'
      said Drummond. 'The Harringtons have had to mourn a dreadful mesalliance.
      Pity the Countess!'
    
    
      'Oh! the Countess! the Countess!' exclaimed Rose to Drummond's pathetic
      shake of the head. She and Drummond were fully agreed about the Countess;
      Drummond mimicking the lady: 'In verity, she is most mellifluous!' while
      Rose sugared her lips and leaned gracefully forward with 'De Saldar, let
      me petition you       since we must endure our title       since it is not
      to be your Louisa?' and her eyes sought the ceiling, and her hand slowly
      melted into her drapery, as the Countess was wont to effect it.
    
    
      Lady Jocelyn laughed, but said: 'You're too hard upon the Countess. The
      female euphuist is not to be met with every day. It's a different kind
      from the Precieuse. She is not a Precieuse. She has made a capital
      selection of her vocabulary from Johnson, and does not work it badly, if
      we may judge by Harry and Melville. Euphuism       [affectation D.W.]       in
      "woman" is the popular ideal of a Duchess. She has it by nature, or she
      has studied it: and if so, you must respect her abilities.'
    
    
      'Yes       Harry!' said Rose, who was angry at a loss of influence over
      her rough brother, 'any one could manage Harry! and Uncle Mel 's a goose.
      You should see what a "female euphuist" Dorry is getting. She says in the
      Countess's hearing: "Rose! I should in verity wish to play, if it were
      pleasing to my sweet cousin?" I'm ready to die with laughing. I don't do
      it, Mama.'
    
    
      The Countess, thus being discussed, was closeted with old Mrs. Bonner: not
      idle. Like Hannibal in Italy, she had crossed her Alps in attaining
      Beckley Court, and here in the enemy's country the wary general found
      herself under the necessity of throwing up entrenchments to fly to in case
      of defeat. Sir Abraham Harrington of Torquay, who had helped her to cross
      the Alps, became a formidable barrier against her return.
    
    
      Meantime Evan was riding over to Fallow field, and as he rode under black
      visions between the hedgeways crowned with their hop-garlands, a fragrance
      of roses saluted his nostril, and he called to mind the red and the white
      the peerless representative of the two had given him, and which he had
      thrust sullenly in his breast-pocket and he drew them out to look at them
      reproachfully and sigh farewell to all the roses of life, when in company
      with them he found in his hand the forgotten letter delivered to him on
      the cricket-field the day of the memorable match. He smelt at the roses,
      and turned the letter this way and that. His name was correctly worded on
      the outside. With an odd reluctance to open it, he kept trifling over the
      flowers, and then broke the broad seal, and these are the words that met
      his eyes:
    
    
      'Mr. EVAN HARRINGTON.
    
    
      'You have made up your mind to be a tailor, instead of a Tomnoddy. You're
      right. Not too many men in the world       plenty of nincompoops.
    
    
      'Don't be made a weathercock of by a parcel of women. I want to find a man
      worth something. If you go on with it, you shall end by riding in your
      carriage, and cutting it as fine as any of them. I 'll take care your
      belly is not punished while you're about it.
    
    
      'From the time your name is over your shop, I give you L300 per annum.
    
    
      'Or stop. There's nine of you. They shall have L40. per annum apiece, 9
      times 40, eh? That's better than L300., if you know how to reckon. Don't
      you wish it was ninety-nine tailors to a man! I could do that too, and it
      would not break me; so don't be a proud young ass, or I 'll throw my money
      to the geese. Lots of them in the world. How many geese to a tailor?
    
    
      'Go on for five years, and I double it.
    
    
      'Give it up, and I give you up.
    
    
      'No question about me. The first tailor can be paid his L40 in advance, by
      applying at the offices of Messrs. Grist, Gray's Inn Square, Gray's Inn.
      Let him say he is tailor No. 1, and show this letter, signed Agreed, with
      your name in full at bottom. This will do       money will be paid       no
      questions one side or other. So on       the whole nine. The end of the
      year they can give a dinner to their acquaintance. Send in bill to Messrs.
      Grist.
    
    
      'The advice to you to take the cash according to terms mentioned is advice
      of
    
    
      'A FRIEND.
    
    
      'P.S. You shall have your wine. Consult among yourselves, and carry it by
      majority what wine it's to be. Five carries it. Dozen and half per tailor,
      per annum       that's the limit.'
    
    
      It was certainly a very hot day. The pores of his skin were prickling, and
      his face was fiery; and yet he increased his pace, and broke into a wild
      gallop for a mile or so; then suddenly turned his horse's head back for
      Beckley. The secret of which evolution was, that he had caught the idea of
      a plotted insult of Laxley's in the letter, for when the blood is up we
      are drawn the way the tide sets strongest, and Evan was prepared to swear
      that Laxley had written the letter, because he was burning to chastise the
      man who had injured him with Rose.
    
    
      Sure that he was about to confirm his suspicion, he read it again, gazed
      upon Beckley Court in the sultry light, and turned for Fallow field once
      more, devising to consult Mr. John Raikes on the subject.
    
    
      The letter had a smack of crabbed age hardly counterfeit. The savour of an
      old eccentric's sour generosity was there. Evan fell into bitter laughter
      at the idea of Rose glancing over his shoulder and asking him what nine of
      him to a man meant. He heard her clear voice pursuing him. He could not
      get away from the mocking sound of Rose beseeching him to instruct her on
      that point. How if the letter were genuine? He began to abhor the sight
      and touch of the paper, for it struck division cold as death between him
      and his darling. He saw now the immeasurable hopes his residence at
      Beckley had lured him to. Rose had slightly awakened him: this letter was
      blank day to his soul. He saw the squalid shop, the good, stern,
      barren-spirited mother, the changeless drudgery, the existence which
      seemed indeed no better than what the ninth of a man was fit for. The
      influence of his mother came on him once more. Dared he reject the gift if
      true? No spark of gratitude could he feel, but chained, dragged at the
      heels of his fate, he submitted to think it true; resolving the next
      moment that it was a fabrication and a trap: but he flung away the roses.
    
    
      As idle as a painted cavalier upon a painted drop-scene, the figure of Mr.
      John Raikes was to be observed leaning with crossed legs against a shady
      pillar of the Green Dragon; eyeing alternately, with an indifference he
      did not care to conceal, the assiduous pecking in the dust of some cocks
      and hens that had strayed from the yard of the inn, and the sleepy
      blinking in the sun of an old dog at his feet: nor did Evan's appearance
      discompose the sad sedateness of his demeanour.
    
    
      'Yes; I am here still,' he answered Evan's greeting, with a flaccid
      gesture. 'Don't excite me too much. A little at a time. I can't bear it!'
    
    
      'How now? What is it now, Jack?' said Evan.
    
    
      Mr. Raikes pointed at the dog. 'I've made a bet with myself he won't wag
      his tail within the next ten minutes. I beg of you, Harrington, to remain
      silent for both our sakes.'
    
    
      Evan was induced to look at the dog, and the dog looked at him, and gently
      moved his tail.
    
    
      'I 've lost!' cried Raikes, in languid anguish. 'He 's getting excited.
      He'll go mad. We're not accustomed to this in Fallow field.'
    
    
      Evan dismounted, and was going to tell him the news he had for him, when
      his attention was distracted by the sight of Rose's maid, Polly Wheedle,
      splendidly bonneted, who slipped past them into the inn, after repulsing
      Jack's careless attempt to caress her chin; which caused him to tell Evan
      that he could not get on without the society of intellectual women.
    
    
      Evan called a boy to hold the horse.
    
    
      'Have you seen her before, Jack?'
    
    
      Jack replied: 'Once. Your pensioner up-stairs she comes to visit. I do
      suspect there kinship is betwixt them. Ay! one might swear them sisters.
      She's a relief to the monotony of the petrified street       the old man
      with the brown-gaitered legs and the doubled-up old woman with the crutch.
      I heard the London horn this morning.'
    
    
      Evan thrust the letter in his hands, telling him to read and form an
      opinion on it, and went in the track of Miss Wheedle.
    
    
      Mr. Raikes resumed his station against the pillar, and held the letter out
      on a level with his thigh. Acting (as it was his nature to do off the
      stage), he had not exaggerated his profound melancholy. Of a light soil
      and with a tropical temperament, he had exhausted all lively recollection
      of his brilliant career, and, in the short time since Evan had parted with
      him, sunk abjectly down into the belief that he was fixed in Fallow field
      for life. His spirit pitied for agitation and events. The horn of the
      London coach had sounded distant metropolitan glories in the ears of the
      exile in rustic parts.
    
    
      Sighing heavily, Raikes opened the letter, in simple obedience to the
      wishes of his friend; for he would have preferred to stand contemplating
      his own state of hopeless stagnation. The sceptical expression he put on
      when he had read the letter through must not deceive us. John Raikes had
      dreamed of a beneficent eccentric old gentleman for many years: one
      against whom, haply, he had bumped in a crowded thoroughfare, and had with
      cordial politeness begged pardon of; had then picked up his walking-stick;
      restored it, venturing a witty remark; retired, accidentally dropping his
      card-case; subsequently, to his astonishment and gratification, receiving
      a pregnant missive from that old gentleman's lawyer. Or it so happened
      that Mr. Raikes met the old gentleman at a tavern, and, by the exercise of
      a signal dexterity, relieved him from a bone in his throat, and
      reluctantly imparted his address on issuing from the said tavern. Or
      perhaps it was a lonely highway where the old gentleman walked, and John
      Raikes had his name in the papers for a deed of heroism, nor was man
      ungrateful. Since he had eaten up his uncle, this old gentleman of his
      dreams walked in town and country-only, and alas! Mr. Raikes could never
      encounter him in the flesh. The muscles of his face, therefore, are no
      index to the real feelings of the youth when he had thoroughly mastered
      the contents of the letter, and reflected that the dream of his luck       his
      angelic old gentleman       had gone and wantonly bestowed himself upon
      Evan Harrington, instead of the expectant and far worthier John Raikes.
      Worthier inasmuch as he gave him credence for existing long ere he knew of
      him and beheld him manifest.
    
    
      Raikes retreated to the vacant parlour of the Green Dragon, and there Evan
      found him staring at the unfolded letter, his head between his cramped
      fists, with a contraction of his mouth. Evan was troubled by what he had
      seen up-stairs, and did not speak till Jack looked up and said, 'Oh, there
      you are.'
    
    
      'Well, what do you think, Jack?'
    
    
      'Yes       it's all right,' Raikes rejoined in most matter-of-course tone,
      and then he stepped to the window, and puffed a very deep breath indeed,
      and glanced from the straight line of the street to the heavens, with
      whom, injured as he was, he felt more at home now that he knew them
      capable of miracles.
    
    
      'Is it a bad joke played upon me?' said Evan.
    
    
      Raikes upset a chair. 'It's quite childish. You're made a gentleman for
      life, and you ask if it's a joke played upon you! It's maddening! There       there
      goes my hat!'
    
    
      With a vehement kick, Mr. Raikes despatched his ancient head-gear to the
      other end of the room, saying that he must have some wine, and would; and
      disdainful was his look at Evan, when the latter attempted to reason him
      into economy. He ordered the wine; drank a glass, which coloured a new
      mood in him; and affecting a practical manner, said:
    
    
      'I confess I have been a little hurt with you, Harrington. You left me
      stranded on the desert isle. I thought myself abandoned. I thought I
      should never see anything but the lengthening of an endless bill on my
      landlady's face       my sole planet. I was resigned till I heard my
      friend "to-lool!" this morning. He kindled recollection. But, this is a
      tidy Port, and that was a delectable sort of young lady that you were
      riding with when we parted last! She laughs like the true metal. I suppose
      you know it 's the identical damsel I met the day before, and owe it to
      for my run on the downs       I 've a compliment ready made for her.'
    
    
      'You think that letter written in good faith?' said Evan.
    
    
      'Look here.' Mr. Raikes put on a calmness. 'You got up the other night,
      and said you were a tailor       a devotee of the cabbage and the goose.
      Why the notion didn't strike me is extraordinary       I ought to have
      known my man. However, the old gentleman who gave the supper       he's
      evidently one of your beastly rich old ruffianly republicans       spent
      part of his time in America, I dare say. Put two and two together.'
    
    
      But as Harrington desired plain, prose, Mr. Raikes tamed his imagination
      to deliver it. He pointed distinctly at the old gentleman who gave the
      supper as the writer of the letter. Evan, in return, confided to him his
      history and present position, and Mr. Raikes, without cooling to his
      fortunate friend, became a trifle patronizing.
    
    
      'You said your father       I think I remember at old Cudford's       was
      a cavalry officer, a bold dragoon?'
    
    
      'I did,' replied Evan. 'I told a lie.'
    
    
      'We knew it; but we feared your prowess, Harrington.'
    
    
      Then they talked over the singular letter uninterruptedly, and Evan, weak
      among his perplexities of position and sentiment: wanting money for the
      girl up-stairs, for this distasteful comrade's bill at the Green Dragon,
      and for his own immediate requirements, and with the bee buzzing of Rose
      in his ears: 'She despises you,' consented in a desperation ultimately to
      sign his name to it, and despatch Jack forthwith to Messrs. Grist.
    
    
      'You'll find it's an imposition,' he said, beginning less to think it so,
      now that his name was put to the hated monstrous thing; which also now
      fell to pricking at curiosity. For he was in the early steps of his
      career, and if his lady, holding to pride, despised him       as, he was
      tortured into the hypocrisy of confessing, she justly might, why, then,
      unless he was the sport of a farceur, here seemed a gilding of the path of
      duty: he could be serviceable to friends. His claim on fair young Rose's
      love had grown in the short while so prodigiously asinine that it was a
      minor matter to constitute himself an old eccentric's puppet.
    
    
      'No more an imposition than it's 50 of Virgil,' quoth the rejected usher.
    
    
      'It smells of a plot,' said Evan.
    
    
      'It 's the best joke that will be made in my time,' said Mr. Raikes,
      rubbing his hands.
    
    
      'And now listen to your luck,' said Evan; 'I wish mine were like it!' and
      Jack heard of Lady Jocelyn's offer. He heard also that the young lady he
      was to instruct was an heiress, and immediately inspected his garments,
      and showed the sacred necessity there was for him to refit in London,
      under the hands of scientific tailors. Evan wrote him an introduction to
      Mr. Goren, counted out the contents of his purse (which Jack had reduced
      in his study of the pastoral game of skittles, he confessed), and
      calculated in a niggardly way, how far it would go to supply the fellow's
      wants; sighing, as he did it, to think of Jack installed at Beckley Court,
      while Jack, comparing his luck with Evan's, had discovered it to be
      dismally inferior.
    
    
      'Oh, confound those bellows you keep blowing!' he exclaimed. 'I wish to be
      decently polite, Harrington, but you annoy me. Excuse me, pray, but the
      most unexampled case of a lucky beggar that ever was known       and to
      hear him panting and ready to whimper!       it's outrageous. You've only
      to put up your name, and there you are       an independent gentleman! By
      Jove! this isn't such a dull world. John Raikes! thou livest in times. I
      feel warm in the sun of your prosperity, Harrington. Now listen to me.
      Propound thou no inquiries anywhere about the old fellow who gave the
      supper. Humour his whim       he won't have it. All Fallow field is paid
      to keep him secret; I know it for a fact. I plied my rustic friends every
      night. "Eat you yer victuals, and drink yer beer, and none o' yer pryin's
      and peerin's among we!" That's my rebuff from Farmer Broadmead. And that
      old boy knows more than he will tell. I saw his cunning old eye on-cock.
      Be silent, Harrington. Let discretion be the seal of thy luck.'
    
    
      'You can reckon on my silence,' said Evan. 'I believe in no such folly.
      Men don't do these things.'
    
    
      'Ha!' went Mr. Raikes contemptuously.
    
    
      Of the two he was the foolisher fellow; but quacks have cured
      incomprehensible maladies, and foolish fellows have an instinct for
      eccentric actions.
    
    
      Telling Jack to finish the wine, Evan rose to go.
    
    
      'Did you order the horse to be fed?'
    
    
      'Did I order the feeding of the horse?' said Jack, rising and yawning.
      'No, I forgot him. Who can think of horses now?'
    
    
      'Poor brute!' muttered Evan, and went out to see to him.
    
    
      The ostler had required no instructions to give the horse a feed of corn.
      Evan mounted, and rode out of the yard to where Jack was standing,
      bare-headed, in his old posture against the pillar, of which the shade had
      rounded, and the evening sun shone full on him over a black cloud. He now
      looked calmly gay.
    
    
      'I 'm laughing at the agricultural Broadmead!' he said: "'None o' yer
      pryin's and peerin's!" He thought my powers of amusing prodigious. "Dang
      'un, he do maak a chap laugh!" Well, Harrington, that sort of homage isn't
      much, I admit.'
    
    
      Raikes pursued: 'There's something in a pastoral life, after all.'
    
    
      'Pastoral!' muttered Evan. 'I was speaking of you at Beckley, and hope
      when you're there you won't make me regret my introduction of you. Keep
      your mind on old Cudford's mutton-bone.'
    
    
      'I perfectly understood you,' said Jack. 'I 'm Presumed to be in luck.
      Ingratitude is not my fault       I'm afraid ambition is!'
    
    
      'Console yourself with it or what you can get till we meet       here or
      in London. But the Dragon shall be the address for both of us,' Evan said,
      and nodded, trotting off.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XVIII. IN WHICH EVAN CALLS HIMSELF GENTLEMAN
    
    
      The young cavalier perused that letter again in memory. Genuine, or a joke
      of the enemy, it spoke wakening facts to him. He leapt from the spell Rose
      had encircled him with. Strange that he should have rushed into his dream
      with eyes open! But he was fully awake now. He would speak his last
      farewell to her, and so end the earthly happiness he paid for in deep
      humiliation, and depart into that gray cold mist where his duty lay. It is
      thus that young men occasionally design to burst from the circle of the
      passions, and think that they have done it, when indeed they are but
      making the circle more swiftly. Here was Evan mouthing his farewell to
      Rose, using phrases so profoundly humble, that a listener would have taken
      them for bitter irony. He said adieu to her,       pronouncing it with a
      pathos to melt scornful princesses. He tried to be honest, and was as much
      so as his disease permitted.
    
    
      The black cloud had swallowed the sun; and turning off to the short cut
      across the downs, Evan soon rode between the wind and the storm. He could
      see the heavy burden breasting the beacon-point, round which curled leaden
      arms, and a low internal growl saluted him advancing. The horse laid back
      his ears. A last gust from the opposing quarter shook the furzes and the
      clumps of long pale grass, and straight fell columns of rattling white
      rain, and in a minute he was closed in by a hissing ring. Men thus pelted
      abandon without protest the hope of retaining a dry particle of clothing
      on their persons. Completely drenched, the track lost, everything in dense
      gloom beyond the white enclosure that moved with him, Evan flung the reins
      to the horse, and curiously watched him footing on; for physical
      discomfort balanced his mental perturbation, and he who had just been
      chafing was now quite calm.
    
    
      Was that a shepherd crouched under the thorn? The place betokened a
      shepherd, but it really looked like a bundle of the opposite sex; and it
      proved to be a woman gathered up with her gown over her head. Apparently,
      Mr. Evan Harrington was destined for these encounters. The thunder rolled
      as he stopped by her side and called out to her. She heard him, for she
      made a movement, but without sufficiently disengaging her head of its
      covering to show him a part of her face.
    
    
      Bellowing against the thunder, Evan bade her throw back her garment, and
      stand and give him up her arms, that he might lift her on the horse behind
      him.
    
    
      There came a muffled answer, on a big sob, as it seemed. And as if heaven
      paused to hear, the storm was mute.
    
    
      Could he have heard correctly? The words he fancied he had heard sobbed
      were:
    
    
      'Best bonnet.'
    
    
      The elements hereupon crashed deep and long from end to end, like a table
      of Titans passing a jest.
    
    
      Rain-drops, hard as hail, were spattering a pool on her head. Evan stooped
      his shoulder, seized the soaked garment, and pulled it back, revealing the
      features of Polly Wheedle, and the splendid bonnet in ruins       all limp
      and stained.
    
    
      Polly blinked at him penitentially.
    
    
      'Oh, Mr. Harrington; oh, ain't I punished!' she whimpered.
    
    
      In truth, the maid resembled a well-watered poppy.
    
    
      Evan told her to stand up close to the horse, and Polly stood up close,
      looking like a creature that expected a whipping. She was suffering, poor
      thing, from that abject sense of the lack of a circumference, which takes
      the pride out of women more than anything. Note, that in all material
      fashions, as in all moral observances, women demand a circumference, and
      enlarge it more and more as civilization advances. Respect the mighty
      instinct, however mysterious it seem.
    
    
      'Oh, Mr. Harrington, don't laugh at me,' said Polly.
    
    
      Evan assured her that he was seriously examining her bonnet.
    
    
      'It 's the bonnet of a draggletail,' said Polly, giving up her arms, and
      biting her under-lip for the lift.
    
    
      With some display of strength, Evan got the lean creature up behind him,
      and Polly settled there, and squeezed him tightly with her arms, excusing
      the liberty she took.
    
    
      They mounted the beacon, and rode along the ridge whence the West became
      visible, and a washed edge of red over Beckley Church spire and the woods
      of Beckley Court.
    
    
      'And what have you been doing to be punished? What brought you here?' said
      Evan.
    
    
      'Somebody drove me to Fallow field to see my poor sister Susan,' returned
      Polly, half crying.
    
    
      'Well, did he bring you here and leave you?
    
    
      'No: he wasn't true to his appointment the moment I wanted to go back; and
      I, to pay him out, I determined I'd walk it where he shouldn't overtake
      me, and on came the storm... And my gown spoilt, and such a bonnet!'
    
    
      'Who was the somebody?'
    
    
      'He's a Mr. Nicholas Frim, sir.'
    
    
      'Mr. Nicholas Frim will be very unhappy, I should think.'
    
    
      'Yes, that's one comfort,' said Polly ruefully, drying her eyes.
    
    
      Closely surrounding a young man as a young woman must be when both are on
      the same horse, they, as a rule, talk confidentially together in a very
      short time. His 'Are you cold?' when Polly shivered, and her 'Oh, no; not
      very,' and a slight screwing of her body up to him, as she spoke, to
      assure him and herself of it, soon made them intimate.
    
    
      'I think Mr. Nicholas Frim mustn't see us riding into Beckley,' said Evan.
    
    
      'Oh, my gracious! Ought I to get down, sir?' Polly made no move, however.
    
    
      'Is he jealous?'
    
    
      'Only when I make him, he is.'
    
    
      'That's very naughty of you.'
    
    
      'Yes, I know it is       all the Wheedles are. Mother says, we never go
      right till we 've once got in a pickle.'
    
    
      'You ought to go right from this hour,' said Evan.
    
    
      'It's 'dizenzy       [?? D.W.]       does it,' said Polly. 'And then we're
      ashamed to show it. My poor Susan went to stay with her aunt at Bodley,
      and then at our cousin's at Hillford, and then she was off to Lymport to
      drown her poor self, I do believe, when you met her. And all because we
      can't bear to be seen when we 're in any of our pickles. I wish you
      wouldn't look at me, Mr. Harrington.'
    
    
      'You look very pretty.'
    
    
      'It 's quite impossible I can now,' said Polly, with a wretched effort to
      spread open her collar. 'I can see myself a fright, like my Miss Rose did,
      making a face in the looking-glass when I was undressing her last night.
      But, do you know, I would much rather Nicholas saw us than somebody!
    
    
      'Who's that?'
    
    
      'Miss Bonner. She'd never forgive me.'
    
    
      'Is she so strict?'
    
    
      'She only uses servants for spies,' said Polly. 'And since my Miss Rose
      come       though I'm up a step       I'm still a servant, and Miss Bonner
      'd be in a fury to see my       though I'm sure we're quite respectable,
      Mr. Harrington       my having hold of you as I'm obliged to, and can't
      help myself. But she'd say I ought to tumble off rather than touch her
      engaged with a little finger.'
    
    
      'Her engaged?' cried Evan.
    
    
      'Ain't you, sir?' quoth Polly. 'I understand you were going to be, from my
      lady, the Countess. We all think so at Beckley. Why, look how Miss Bonner
      looks at you, and she's sure to have plenty of money.'
    
    
      This was Polly's innocent way of bringing out a word about her own young
      mistress.
    
    
      Evan controlled any denial of his pretensions to the hand of Miss Bonner.
      He said: 'Is it your mistress's habit to make faces in the looking-glass?'
    
    
      'I'll tell you how it happened,' said Polly. 'But I'm afraid I'm in your
      way, sir. Shall I get off now?'
    
    
      'Not by any means,' said Evan. 'Make your arm tighter.'
    
    
      'Will that do?' asked Polly.
    
    
      Evan looked round and met her appealing face, over which the damp locks of
      hair straggled. The maid was fair: it was fortunate that he was thinking
      of the mistress.
    
    
      'Speak on,' said Evan, but Polly put the question whether her face did not
      want washing, and so earnestly that he had to regard it again, and
      compromised the case by saying that it wanted kissing by Nicholas Frim,
      which set Polly's lips in a pout.
    
    
      'I 'm sure it wants kissing by nobody,' she said, adding with a spasm of
      passion: 'Oh! I know the colours of my bonnet are all smeared over it, and
      I'm a dreadful fright.'
    
    
      Evan failed to adopt the proper measures to make Miss Wheedle's mind easy
      with regard to her appearance, and she commenced her story rather
      languidly.
    
    
      'My Miss Rose       what was it I was going to tell? Oh!       my Miss
      Rose. You must know, Mr. Harrington, she's very fond of managing; I can
      see that, though I haven't known her long before she gave up short frocks;
      and she said to Mr. Laxley, who's going to marry her some day, "She didn't
      like my lady, the Countess, taking Mr. Harry to herself like that." I
      can't a-bear to speak his name, but I suppose he's not a bit more selfish
      than the rest of men. So Mr. Laxley said       just like the jealousy of
      men       they needn't talk of women! I'm sure nobody can tell what we
      have to put up with. We mustn't look out of this eye, or out of the other,
      but they're up and       oh, dear me! there's such a to-do as never was
      known       all for nothing!'
    
    
      'My good girl!' said Evan, recalling her to the subject-matter with all
      the patience he could command.
    
    
      'Where was I?' Polly travelled meditatively back. 'I do feel a little
      cold.'
    
    
      'Come closer,' said Evan. 'Take this handkerchief       it 's the only dry
      thing I have       cover your chest with it.'
    
    
      'The shoulders feel wettest,' Polly replied, 'and they can't be helped.
      I'll tie it round my neck, if you'll stop, sir. There, now I'm warmer.'
    
    
      To show how concisely women can narrate when they feel warmer, Polly
      started off:
    
    
      'So, you know, Mr. Harrington, Mr. Laxley said       he said to Miss Rose,
      "You have taken her brother, and she has taken yours." And Miss Rose said,
      "That was her own business, and nobody else's." And Mr. Laxley said, "He
      was glad she thought it a fair exchange." I heard it all! And then Miss
      Rose said       for she can be in a passion about some things"       What
      do you mean, Ferdinand," was her words, "I insist upon your speaking out."
      Miss Rose always will call gentlemen by their Christian names when she
      likes them; that's always a sign with her. And he wouldn't tell her. And
      Miss Rose got awful angry, and she's clever, is my Miss Rose, for what
      does she do, Mr. Harrington, but begins praising you up so that she knew
      it must make him mad, only because men can't abide praise of another man
      when it's a woman that says it       meaning, young lady; for my Miss Rose
      has my respect, however familiar she lets herself be to us that she likes.
      The others may go and drown themselves. Are you took ill, sir?'
    
    
      'No,' said Evan, 'I was only breathing.'
    
    
      'The doctors say it's bad to take such long breaths,' remarked artless
      Polly. 'Perhaps my arms are pressing you?'
    
    
      It 's the best thing they can do,' murmured Evan, dejectedly.
    
    
      'What, sir?'
    
    
      'Go and drown themselves.'
    
    
      Polly screwed her lips, as if she had a pin between them, and continued:
      'Miss Rose was quite sensible when she praised you as her friend; she
      meant it       every word; and then sudden what does Mr. Laxley do, but
      say you was something else besides friend       worse or better; and she
      was silent, which made him savage, I could hear by his voice. And he said,
      Mr. Harrington, "You meant it if she did not." "No," says she, "I know
      better; he's as honest as the day." Out he flew and said such things: he
      said, Mr. Harrington, you wasn't fit to be Miss Rose's friend, even. Then
      she said, she heard he had told lies about you to her Mama, and her aunts;
      but her Mama, my lady, laughed at him, and she at her aunts. Then he said
      you       oh, abominable of him!'
    
    
      'What did he say?' asked Evan, waking up.
    
    
      'Why, if I were to tell my Miss Rose some things of him,' Polly went on,
      'she'd never so much as speak to him another instant.'
    
    
      'What did he say?' Evan repeated.
    
    
      'I hate him!' cried Polly. 'It's Mr. Laxley that misleads Mr. Harry, who
      has got his good nature, and means no more harm than he can help. Oh, I
      didn't hear what he said of you, sir. Only I know it was abominable,
      because Miss Rose was so vexed, and you were her dearest friend.'
    
    
      'Well, and about the looking-glass?'
    
    
      'That was at night, Mr. Harrington, when I was undressing of her. Miss
      Rose has a beautiful figure, and no need of lacing. But I'd better get
      down now.'
    
    
      'For heaven's sake, stay where you are.'
    
    
      'I tell her she stands as if she'd been drilled for a soldier,' Polly
      quietly continued. 'You're squeezing my arm with your elbow, Mr.
      Harrington. It didn't hurt me. So when I had her nearly undressed, we were
      talking about this and that, and you amongst 'em       and I, you know,
      rather like you, sir, if you'll not think me too bold       she started
      off by asking me what was the nickname people gave to tailors. It was one
      of her whims. I told her they were called snips       I'm off!'
    
    
      Polly gave a shriek. The horse had reared as if violently stung.
    
    
      'Go on,' said Evan. 'Hold hard, and go on.'
    
    
      'Snips       Oh! and I told her they were called snips. It is a word that
      seems to make you hate the idea. I shouldn't like to hear my intended
      called snip. Oh, he's going to gallop!'
    
    
      And off in a gallop Polly was borne.
    
    
      'Well,' said Evan, 'well?'
    
    
      'I can't, Mr. Harrington; I have to press you so,' cried Polly; 'and I'm
      bounced so       I shall bite my tongue.'
    
    
      After a sharp stretch, the horse fell to a canter, and then trotted
      slowly, and allowed Polly to finish.
    
    
      'So Miss Rose was standing sideways to the glass, and she turned her neck,
      and just as I'd said "snip," I saw her saying it in the glass; and you
      never saw anything so funny. It was enough to make anybody laugh; but Miss
      Rose, she seemed as if she couldn't forget how ugly it had made her look.
      She covered her face with her hands, and she shuddered! It is a word-snip!
      that makes you seem to despise yourself.'
    
    
      Beckley was now in sight from the edge of the downs, lying in its foliage
      dark under the grey sky backed by motionless mounds of vapour. Miss
      Wheedle to her great surprise was suddenly though safely dropped; and on
      her return to the ground the damsel instantly 'knew her place,' and
      curtseyed becoming gratitude for his kindness; but he was off in a fiery
      gallop, the gall of Demogorgon in his soul.
    
    
      What 's that the leaves of the proud old trees of Beckley Court hiss as he
      sweeps beneath them? What has suddenly cut him short? Is he diminished in
      stature? Are the lackeys sneering? The storm that has passed has
      marvellously chilled the air.
    
    
      His sister, the Countess, once explained to him what Demogorgon was, in
      the sensation it entailed. 'You are skinned alive!' said the Countess.
      Evan was skinned alive. Fly, wretched young man! Summon your pride, and
      fly! Fly, noble youth, for whom storms specially travel to tell you that
      your mistress makes faces in the looking-glass! Fly where human lips and
      noses are not scornfully distorted, and get thee a new skin, and grow and
      attain to thy natural height in a more genial sphere! You, ladies and
      gentlemen, who may have had a matter to conceal, and find that it is
      oozing out: you, whose skeleton is seen stalking beside you, you know what
      it is to be breathed upon: you, too, are skinned alive: but this miserable
      youth is not only flayed, he is doomed calmly to contemplate the hideous
      image of himself burning on the face of her he loves; making beauty
      ghastly. In vain       for he is two hours behind the dinner-bell       Mr.
      Burley, the butler, bows and offers him viands and wine. How can he eat,
      with the phantom of Rose there, covering her head, shuddering, loathing
      him? But he must appear in company: he has a coat, if he has not a skin.
      Let him button it, and march boldly. Our comedies are frequently youth's
      tragedies. We will smile reservedly as we mark Mr. Evan Harrington step
      into the midst of the fair society of the drawing-room. Rose is at the
      piano. Near her reclines the Countess de Saldar, fanning the languors from
      her cheeks, with a word for the diplomatist on one side, a whisper for Sir
      John Loring on the other, and a very quiet pair of eyes for everybody.
      Providence, she is sure, is keeping watch to shield her sensitive cuticle;
      and she is besides exquisitely happy, albeit outwardly composed: for, in
      the room sits his Grace the Duke of Belfield, newly arrived. He is talking
      to her sister, Mrs. Strike, masked by Miss Current. The wife of the Major
      has come this afternoon, and Andrew Cogglesby, who brought her, chats with
      Lady Jocelyn like an old acquaintance.
    
    
      Evan shakes the hands of his relatives. Who shall turn over the leaves of
      the fair singer's music-book? The young men are in the billiard-room:
      Drummond is engaged in converse with a lovely person with Giorgione hair,
      which the Countess intensely admires, and asks the diplomatist whether he
      can see a soupcon of red in it. The diplomatist's taste is for dark
      beauties: the Countess is dark.
    
    
      Evan must do duty by Rose. And now occurred a phenomenon in him. Instead
      of shunning her, as he had rejoiced in doing after the Jocasta scene, ere
      she had wounded him, he had a curious desire to compare her with the
      phantom that had dispossessed her in his fancy. Unconsciously when he saw
      her, he transferred the shame that devoured him, from him to her, and
      gazed coldly at the face that could twist to that despicable contortion.
    
    
      He was in love, and subtle love will not be shamed and smothered. Love
      sits, we must remember, mostly in two hearts at the same time, and the one
      that is first stirred by any of the passions to wakefulness, may know more
      of the other than its owner. Why had Rose covered her head and shuddered?
      Would the girl feel that for a friend? If his pride suffered, love was not
      so downcast; but to avenge him for the cold she had cast on him, it could
      be critical, and Evan made his bearing to her a blank.
    
    
      This somehow favoured him with Rose. Sheep's eyes are a dainty dish for
      little maids, and we know how largely they indulge in it; but when they
      are just a bit doubtful of the quality of the sheep, let the good animal
      shut his lids forthwith, for a time. Had she not been a little unkind to
      him in the morning? She had since tried to help him, and that had appeased
      her conscience, for in truth he was a good young man. Those very words she
      mentally pronounced, while he was thinking, 'Would she feel it for a
      friend?' We dare but guess at the puzzle young women present now and then,
      but I should say that Evan was nearer the mark, and that the 'good young
      man' was a sop she threw to that within her which wanted quieting, and was
      thereby passably quieted. Perhaps the good young man is offended? Let us
      assure him of our disinterested graciousness.
    
    
      'Is your friend coming?' she asked, and to his reply said, 'I'm glad'; and
      pitched upon a new song-one that, by hazard, did not demand his
      attentions, and he surveyed the company to find a vacant seat with a
      neighbour. Juley Bonner was curled up on the sofa, looking like a damsel
      who has lost the third volume of an exciting novel, and is divining the
      climax. He chose to avoid Miss Bonner. Drummond was leaving the side of
      the Giorgione lady. Evan passed leisurely, and Drummond said 'You know
      Mrs. Evremonde? Let me introduce you.'
    
    
      He was soon in conversation with the glorious-haired dame.
    
    
      'Excellently done, my brother!' thinks the Countess de Saldar.
    
    
      Rose sees the matter coolly. What is it to her? But she had finished with
      song. Jenny takes her place at the piano; and, as Rose does not care for
      instrumental music, she naturally talks and laughs with Drummond, and
      Jenny does not altogether like it, even though she is not playing to the
      ear of William Harvey, for whom billiards have such attractions; but, at
      the close of the performance, Rose is quiet enough, and the Countess
      observes her sitting, alone, pulling the petals of a flower in her lap, on
      which her eyes are fixed. Is the doe wounded? The damsel of the
      disinterested graciousness is assuredly restless. She starts up and goes
      out upon the balcony to breathe the night-air, mayhap regard the moon, and
      no one follows her.
    
    
      Had Rose been guiltless of offence, Evan might have left Beckley Court the
      next day, to cherish his outraged self-love. Love of woman is strongly
      distinguished from pure egoism when it has got a wound: for it will not go
      into a corner complaining, it will fight its duel on the field or die. Did
      the young lady know his origin, and scorn him? He resolved to stay and
      teach her that the presumption she had imputed to him was her own mistake.
      And from this Evan graduated naturally enough the finer stages of
      self-deception downward.
    
    
      A lover must have his delusions, just as a man must have a skin. But here
      was another singular change in Evan. After his ale-prompted speech in
      Fallow field, he was nerved to face the truth in the eyes of all save
      Rose. Now that the truth had enmeshed his beloved, he turned to battle
      with it; he was prepared to deny it at any moment; his burnt flesh was as
      sensitive as the Countess's.
    
    
      Let Rose accuse him, and he would say, 'This is true, Miss Jocelyn       what
      then?' and behold Rose confused and dumb! Let not another dare suspect it.
      For the fire that had scorched him was in some sort healing, though
      horribly painful; but contact with the general air was not to be endured       was
      death! This, I believe, is common in cases of injury by fire. So it befell
      that Evan, meeting Rose the next morning was playfully asked by her what
      choice he had made between the white and the red; and he, dropping on her
      the shallow eyes of a conventional smile, replied, that unable to decide
      and form a choice, he had thrown both away; at which Miss Jocelyn gave him
      a look in the centre of his brows, let her head slightly droop, and walked
      off.
    
    
      'She can look serious as well as grimace,' was all that Evan allowed
      himself to think, and he strolled out on the lawn with the careless
      serenity of lovers when they fancy themselves heart-free.
    
    
      Rose, whipping the piano in the drawing-room, could see him go to sit by
      Mrs. Evremonde, till they were joined by Drummond, when he left her and
      walked with Harry, and apparently shadowed the young gentleman's
      unreflective face; after which Harry was drawn away by the appearance of
      that dark star, the Countess de Saldar, whom Rose was beginning to detest.
      Jenny glided by William Harvey's side, far off. Rose, the young Queen of
      Friendship, was left deserted on her music-stool for a throne, and when
      she ceased to hammer the notes she was insulted by a voice that cried from
      below:
    
    
      'Go on, Rose, it's nice in the sun to hear you,' causing her to close her
      performances and the instrument vigorously.
    
    
      Rose was much behind her age: she could not tell what was the matter with
      her. In these little torments young people have to pass through they gain
      a rapid maturity. Let a girl talk with her own heart an hour, and she is
      almost a woman. Rose came down-stairs dressed for riding. Laxley was doing
      her the service of smoking one of her rose-trees. Evan stood disengaged,
      prepared for her summons. She did not notice him, but beckoned to Laxley
      drooping over a bud, while the curled smoke floated from his lips.
    
    
      'The very gracefullest of chimney-pots-is he not?' says the Countess to
      Harry, whose immense guffaw fails not to apprise Laxley that something has
      been said of him, for in his dim state of consciousness absence of the
      power of retort is the prominent feature, and when he has the suspicion of
      malicious tongues at their work, all he can do is silently to resent it.
      Probably this explains his conduct to Evan. Some youths have an acute
      memory for things that have shut their mouths.
    
    
      The Countess observed to Harry that his dear friend Mr. Laxley appeared,
      by the cast of his face, to be biting a sour apple.
    
    
      'Grapes, you mean?' laughed Harry. 'Never mind! she'll bite at him when he
      comes in for the title.'
    
    
      'Anything crude will do,' rejoined the Countess. 'Why are you not courting
      Mrs. Evremonde, naughty Don?'
    
    
      'Oh! she's occupied       castle's in possession. Besides       !' and
      Harry tried hard to look sly.
    
    
      'Come and tell me about her,' said the Countess.
    
    
      Rose, Laxley, and Evan were standing close together.
    
    
      'You really are going alone, Rose?' said Laxley.
    
    
      'Didn't I say so?       unless you wish to join us?' She turned upon Evan.
    
    
      'I am at your disposal,' said Evan.
    
    
      Rose nodded briefly.
    
    
      'I think I'll smoke the trees,' said Laxley, perceptibly huffing.
    
    
      'You won't come, Ferdinand?'
    
    
      'I only offered to fill up the gap. One does as well as another.'
    
    
      Rose flicked her whip, and then declared she would not ride at all, and,
      gathering up her skirts, hurried back to the house.
    
    
      As Laxley turned away, Evan stood before him.
    
    
      The unhappy fellow was precipitated by the devil of his false position.
    
    
      'I think one of us two must quit the field; if I go I will wait for you,'
      he said.
    
    
      'Oh; I understand,' said Laxley. 'But if it 's what I suppose you to mean,
      I must decline.'
    
    
      'I beg to know your grounds.'
    
    
      'You have tied my hands.'
    
    
      'You would escape under cover of superior station?'
    
    
      'Escape! You have only to unsay       tell me you have a right to demand
      it.'
    
    
      The battle of the sophist victorious within him was done in a flash, as
      Evan measured his qualities beside this young man's, and without a sense
      of lying, said: 'I have.'
    
    
      He spoke firmly. He looked the thing he called himself now. The Countess,
      too, was a dazzling shield to her brother. The beautiful Mrs. Strike was a
      completer vindicator of him; though he had queer associates, and talked
      oddly of his family that night in Fallow field.
    
    
      'Very well, sir: I admit you manage to annoy me,' said Laxley. 'I can give
      you a lesson as well as another, if you want it.'
    
    
      Presently the two youths were seen bowing in the stiff curt style of those
      cavaliers who defer a passage of temper for an appointed settlement. Harry
      rushed off to them with a shout, and they separated; Laxley speaking a
      word to Drummond, Evan       most judiciously, the Countess thought       joining
      his fair sister Caroline, whom the Duke held in converse.
    
    
      Drummond returned laughing to the side of Mrs. Evremonde, nearing whom,
      the Countess, while one ear was being filled by Harry's eulogy of her
      brother's recent handling of Laxley, and while her intense gratification
      at the success of her patient management of her most difficult subject
      made her smiles no mask, heard, 'Is it not impossible to suppose such a
      thing?' A hush ensued       the Countess passed.
    
    
      In the afternoon, the Jocelyns, William Harvey, and Drummond met together
      to consult about arranging the dispute; and deputations went to Laxley and
      to Evan. The former demanded an apology for certain expressions that day;
      and an equivalent to an admission that Mr. Harrington had said, in Fallow
      field, that he was not a gentleman, in order to escape the consequences.
      All the Jocelyns laughed at his tenacity, and 'gentleman' began to be
      bandied about in ridicule of the arrogant lean-headed adolescent. Evan was
      placable enough, but dogged; he declined to make any admission, though
      within himself he admitted that his antagonist was not in the position of
      an impostor; which he for one honest word among them would be exposed as
      being, and which a simple exercise of resolution to fly the place would
      save him from being further.
    
    
      Lady Jocelyn enjoyed the fun, and still more the serious way in which her
      relatives regarded it.
    
    
      'This comes of Rose having friends, Emily,' said Mrs. Shorne.
    
    
      There would have been a dispute to arrange between Lady Jocelyn and Mrs.
      Shorne, had not her ladyship been so firmly established in her phlegmatic
      philosophy. She said: 'Quelle enfantillage! I dare say Rose was at the
      bottom of it: she can settle it best. Defer the encounter between the boys
      until they see they are in the form of donkeys. They will; and then
      they'll run on together, as long as their goddess permits.'
    
    
      'Indeed, Emily,' said Mrs. Shorne, 'I desire you, by all possible means,
      to keep the occurrence secret from Rose. She ought not to hear of it.'
    
    
      'No; I dare say she ought not,' returned Lady Jocelyn; 'but I wager you
      she does. You can teach her to pretend not to, if you like. Ecce signum.'
    
    
      Her ladyship pointed through the library window at Rose, who was walking
      with Laxley, and showing him her pearly teeth in return for one of his
      jokes: an exchange so manifestly unfair, that Lady Jocelyn's womanhood,
      indifferent as she was, could not but feel that Rose had an object in
      view; which was true, for she was flattering Laxley into a consent to meet
      Evan half way.
    
    
      The ladies murmured and hummed of these proceedings, and of Rose's
      familiarity with Mr. Harrington; and the Countess in trepidation took Evan
      to herself, and spoke to him seriously; a thing she had not done since her
      residence in Beckley. She let him see that he must be on a friendly
      footing with everybody in the house, or go which latter alternative Evan
      told her he had decided on. 'Yes,' said the Countess, 'and then you give
      people full warrant to say it was jealousy drove you hence; and you do but
      extinguish yourself to implicate dear Rose. In love, Evan, when you run
      away, you don't live to fight another day.'
    
    
      She was commanded not to speak of love.
    
    
      'Whatever it may be, my dear,' said the Countess, 'Mr. Laxley has used you
      ill. It may be that you put yourself at his feet'; and his sister looked
      at him, sighing a great sigh. She had, with violence, stayed her mouth
      concerning what she knew of the Fallow field business, dreading to alarm
      his sensitiveness; but she could not avoid giving him a little slap. It
      was only to make him remember by the smart that he must always suffer when
      he would not be guided by her.
    
    
      Evan professed to the Jocelyns that he was willing to apologize to Laxley
      for certain expressions; determining to leave the house when he had done
      it. The Countess heard and nodded. The young men, sounded on both sides,
      were accordingly lured to the billiard-room, and pushed together: and when
      he had succeeded in thrusting the idea of Rose from the dispute, it did
      seem such folly to Evan's common sense, that he spoke with pleasant
      bonhommie about it. That done, he entered into his acted part, and towered
      in his conceit considerably above these aristocratic boors, who were
      speechless and graceless, but tigers for their privileges and advantages.
    
    
      It will not be thought that the Countess intended to permit her brother's
      departure. To have toiled, and yet more, to have lied and fretted her
      conscience, for nothing, was as little her principle, as to quit the field
      of action till she is forcibly driven from it is that of any woman.
    
    
      'Going, my dear,' she said coolly. 'To-morrow? Oh! very well. You are the
      judge. And this creature       the insolvent to the apple-woman, who is
      coming, whom you would push here       will expose us, without a soul to
      guide his conduct, for I shall not remain. And Carry will not remain.
      Carry       -!' The Countess gave a semisob. 'Carry must return to her
      brute       ' meaning the gallant Marine, her possessor.
    
    
      And the Countess, knowing that Evan loved his sister Caroline,
      incidentally related to him an episode in the domestic life of Major and
      Mrs. Strike.
    
    
      'Greatly redounding to the credit of the noble martinet for the discipline
      he upholds,' the Countess said, smiling at the stunned youth.
    
    
      'I would advise you to give her time to recover from one bruise,' she
      added. 'You will do as it pleases you.'
    
    
      Evan was sent rushing from the Countess to Caroline, with whom the
      Countess was content to leave him.
    
    
      The young man was daintily managed. Caroline asked him to stay, as she did
      not see him often, and (she brought it in at the close) her home was not
      very happy. She did not entreat him, but looking resigned, her lovely face
      conjured up the Major to Evan, and he thought, 'Can I drive her back to
      her tyrant?' For so he juggled with himself to have but another day in the
      sunshine of Rose.
    
    
      Andrew, too, threw out genial hints about the Brewery. Old Tom intended to
      retire, he said, and then they would see what they would see! He silenced
      every word about Lymport; called him a brewer already, and made absurd
      jokes, that were serviceable stuff nevertheless to the Countess, who
      deplored to this one and to that the chance existing that Evan might, by
      the urgent solicitations of his brother-in-law, give up diplomacy and its
      honours for a brewery and lucre!
    
    
      Of course Evan knew that he was managed. The memoirs of a managed man have
      yet to be written; but if he be sincere he will tell you that he knew it
      all the time. He longed for the sugar-plum; he knew it was naughty to take
      it: he dared not for fear of the devil, and he shut his eyes while
      somebody else popped it into his mouth, and assumed his responsibility.
      Being man-driven or chicaned, is different from being managed. Being
      managed implies being led the way this other person thinks you should go:
      altogether for your own benefit, mind: you are to see with her eyes, that
      you may not disappoint your own appetites: which does not hurt the flesh,
      certainly; but does damage the conscience; and from the moment you have
      once succumbed, that function ceases to perform its office of moral
      strainer so well.
    
    
      After all, was he not happier when he wrote himself tailor, than when he
      declared himself gentleman?
    
    
      So he now imagined, till Rose, wishing him 'Good night' on the balcony,
      and abandoning her hand with a steady sweet voice and gaze, said: 'How
      generous of you to forgive my friend, dear Evan!' And the ravishing little
      glimpse of womanly softness in her, set his heart beating. If he thought
      at all, it was that he would have sacrificed body and soul for her.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XIX. SECOND DESPATCH OF THE COUNTESS
    
    
      We do not advance very far in this second despatch, and it will be found
      chiefly serviceable for the indications it affords of our General's skill
      in mining, and addiction to that branch of military science. For the
      moment I must beg that a little indulgence be granted to her.
    
    
      'Purely business. Great haste. Something has happened. An event? I know
      not; but events may flow from it.
    
    
      'A lady is here who has run away from the conjugal abode, and Lady Jocelyn
      shelters her, and is hospitable to another, who is more concerned in this
      lady's sad fate than he should be. This may be morals, my dear: but please
      do not talk of Portugal now. A fineish woman with a great deal of hair
      worn as if her maid had given it one comb straight down and then rolled it
      up in a hurry round one finger. Malice would say carrots. It is called
      gold. Mr. Forth is in a glass house, and is wrong to cast his sneers at
      perfectly inoffensive people.
    
    
      'Perfectly impossible we can remain at Beckley Court together       if not
      dangerous. Any means that Providence may designate, I would employ. It
      will be like exorcising a demon. Always excuseable. I only ask a little
      more time for stupid Evan. He might have little Bonner now. I should not
      object; but her family is not so good.
    
    
      'Now, do attend. At once obtain a copy of Strike's Company people. You
      understand       prospectuses. Tell me instantly if the Captain Evremonde
      in it is Captain Lawson Evremonde. Pump Strike. Excuse vulgar words.
      Whether he is not Lord Laxley's half-brother. Strike shall be of use to
      us. Whether he is not mad. Captain E              's address. Oh! when I
      think of Strike       brute! and poor beautiful uncomplaining Carry and
      her shoulder! But let us indeed most fervently hope that his Grace may be
      balm to it. We must not pray for vengeance. It is sinful. Providence will
      inflict that. Always know that Providence is quite sure to. It comforts
      exceedingly.
    
    
      'Oh, that Strike were altogether in the past tense! No knowing what the
      Duke might do       a widower and completely subjugated. It makes my bosom
      bound. The man tempts me to the wickedest Frenchy ideas. There!
    
    
      We progress with dear venerable Mrs. Bonner. Truly pious       interested
      in your Louisa. She dreads that my husband will try to convert me to his
      creed. I can but weep and say       never!
    
    
      'I need not say I have my circle. To hear this ridiculous boy Harry
      Jocelyn grunt under my nose when he has led me unsuspectingly away from
      company       Harriet! dearest! He thinks it a sigh! But there is no time
      for laughing.
    
    
      'My maxim in any house is       never to despise the good opinion of the
      nonentities. They are the majority. I think they all look up to me. But
      then of course you must fix that by seducing the stars. My diplomatist
      praises my abilities       Sir John Loring my style       the rest follow
      and I do not withhold my smiles, and they are happy, and I should be but
      that for ungrateful Evan's sake I sacrificed my peace by binding myself to
      a dreadful sort of half-story. I know I did not quite say it. It seems as
      if Sir A.'s ghost were going to haunt me. And then I have the most
      dreadful fears that what I have done has disturbed him in the other world.
      Can it be so? It is not money or estates we took at all, dearest! And
      these excellent young curates       I almost wish it was Protestant to
      speak a word behind a board to them and imbibe comfort. For after all it
      is nothing: and a word even from this poor thin mopy Mr. Parsley might be
      relief to a poor soul in trouble. Catholics tell you that what you do in a
      good cause is redeemable if not exactly right. And you know the Catholic
      is the oldest Religion of the two. I would listen to the Pope, staunch
      Protestant as I am, in preference to King Henry the Eighth. Though, as a
      woman, I bear him no rancour, for his wives were       fools, point blank.
      No man was ever so manageable. My diplomatist is getting liker and liker
      to him every day. Leaner, of course, and does not habitually straddle.
      Whiskers and morals, I mean. We must be silent before our prudish sister.
      Not a prude? We talk diplomacy, dearest. He complains of the exclusiveness
      of the port of Oporto, and would have strict alliance between Portugal and
      England, with mutual privileges. I wish the alliance, and think it better
      to maintain the exclusiveness. Very trifling; but what is life!
    
    
      'Adieu. One word to leave you laughing. Imagine her situation! This stupid
      Miss Carrington has offended me. She has tried to pump Conning, who, I do
      not doubt, gave her as much truth as I chose she should have in her well.
      But the quandary of the wretched creature! She takes Conning into her
      confidence       a horrible malady just covered by high-neck dress! Skin!
      and impossible that she can tell her engaged       who is       guess       Mr.
      George Up                     ! Her name is Louisa Carrington. There was a
      Louisa Harrington once. Similarity of names perhaps. Of course I could not
      let her come to the house; and of course Miss C. is in a state of
      wonderment and bad passions, I fear. I went straight to Lady Racial, my
      dear. There was nothing else for it but to go and speak. She is truly a
      noble woman       serves us in every way. As she should!       much
      affected by sight of Evan, and keeps aloof from Beckley Court. The finger
      of Providence is in all. Adieu! but do pray think of Miss Carrington! It
      was foolish of her to offend me. Drives and walks-the Duke attentive.
      Description of him when I embrace you. I give amiable Sir Franks
      Portuguese dishes. Ah, my dear, if we had none but men to contend against,
      and only women for our tools! But this is asking for the world, and
      nothing less.
    
    
      'Open again,' she pursues. 'Dear Carry just come in. There are fairies, I
      think, where there are dukes! Where could it have come from? Could any
      human being have sent messengers post to London, ordered, and had it
      despatched here within this short time? You shall not be mystified! I do
      not think I even hinted; but the afternoon walk I had with his Grace, on
      the first day of his arrival, I did shadow it very delicately how much it
      was to be feared our poor Carry could not, that she dared not, betray her
      liege lord in an evening dress. Nothing more, upon my veracity! And Carry
      has this moment received the most beautiful green box, containing two of
      the most heavenly old lace shawls that you ever beheld. We divine it is to
      hide poor Carry's matrimonial blue mark! We know nothing. Will you imagine
      Carry is for not accepting it! Priority of birth does not imply superior
      wits, dear       no allusion to you. I have undertaken all. Arch looks,
      but nothing pointed. His Grace will understand the exquisite expression of
      feminine gratitude. It is so sweet to deal with true nobility. Carry has
      only to look as she always does. One sees Strike sitting on her. Her very
      pliability has rescued her from being utterly squashed long ere this! The
      man makes one vulgar. It would have been not the slightest use asking me
      to be a Christian had I wedded Strike. But think of the fairy presents! It
      has determined me not to be expelled by Mr. Forth       quite. Tell Silva
      he is not forgotten. But, my dear, between us alone, men are so selfish,
      that it is too evident they do not care for private conversations to turn
      upon a lady's husband: not to be risked, only now and then.
    
    
      'I hear that the young ladies and the young gentlemen have been out riding
      a race. The poor little Bonner girl cannot ride, and she says to Carry
      that Rose wishes to break our brother's neck. The child hardly wishes
      that, but she is feelingless. If Evan could care for Miss Bonner, he might
      have B. C.! Oh, it is not so very long a shot, my dear. I am on the spot,
      remember. Old Mrs. Bonner is a most just-minded spirit. Juliana is a
      cripple, and her grandmother wishes to be sure that when she departs to
      her Lord the poor cripple may not be chased from this home of hers. Rose
      cannot calculate       Harry is in disgrace       there is really no
      knowing. This is how I have reckoned; L10,000 extra to Rose; perhaps L1000
      or nothing to H.; all the rest of ready-money       a large sum       no
      use guessing       to Lady Jocelyn; and B. C. to little Bonner       it is
      worth L40,000 Then she sells, or stops       permanent resident. It might
      be so soon, for I can see worthy Mrs. Bonner to be breaking visibly. But
      young men will not see with wiser eyes than their own. Here is Evan
      risking his neck for an indifferent       there's some word for "not
      soft." In short, Rose is the cold-blooded novice, as I have always said,
      the most selfish of the creatures on two legs.
    
    
      'Adieu! Would you have dreamed that Major Nightmare's gallantry to his
      wife would have called forth a gallantry so truly touching and delicate?
      Can you not see Providence there? Out of Evil       the Catholics again!
    
    
      'Address. If Lord Lax       -'s half-brother. If wrong in noddle. This I
      know you will attend to scrupulously. Ridiculous words are sometimes the
      most expressive. Once more, may Heaven bless you all! I thought of you in
      church last Sunday.
    
    
      'I may tell you this: young Mr. Laxley is here. He       but it was Evan's
      utter madness was the cause, and I have not ventured a word to him. He
      compelled Evan to assert his rank, and Mr. Forth's face has been one
      concentrated sneer since THEN. He must know the origin of the Cogglesbys,
      or something. Now you will understand the importance. I cannot be more
      explicit. Only       the man must go.
    
    
      'P.S. I have just ascertained that Lady Jocelyn is quite familiar with
      Andrew's origin!! She must think my poor Harriet an eccentric woman. Of
      course I have not pretended to rank here, merely gentry. It is gentry in
      reality, for had poor Papa been legitimized, he would have been a
      nobleman. You know that; and between the two we may certainly claim
      gentry. I twiddle your little good Andrew to assert it for us twenty times
      a day. Of all the dear little manageable men! It does you infinite credit
      that you respect him as you do. What would have become of me I do not
      know.
    
    
      'P.S. I said two shawls       a black and a white. The black not so costly       very
      well. And so delicate of him to think of the mourning! But the white, my
      dear, must be family       must! Old English point. Exquisitely chaste. So
      different from that Brussels poor Andrew surprised you with. I know it
      cost money, but this is a question of taste. The Duke reconciles me to
      England and all my troubles! He is more like poor Papa than any one of the
      men I have yet seen. The perfect gentleman! I do praise myself for
      managing an invitation to our Carry. She has been a triumph.'
    
    
      Admire the concluding stroke. The Countess calls this letter a purely
      business communication. Commercial men might hardly think so; but perhaps
      ladies will perceive it. She rambles concentrically, if I may so expound
      her. Full of luxurious enjoyment of her position, her mind is active, and
      you see her at one moment marking a plot, the next, with a light
      exclamation, appeasing her conscience, proud that she has one; again she
      calls up rival forms of faith, that she may show the Protestant its little
      shortcomings, and that it is slightly in debt to her (like Providence) for
      her constancy, notwithstanding. The Protestant you see, does not confess,
      and she has to absolve herself, and must be doing it internally while she
      is directing outer matters. Hence her slap at King Henry VIII. In fact,
      there is much more business in this letter than I dare to indicate; but as
      it is both impertinent and unpopular to dive for any length of time
      beneath the surface (especially when there are few pearls to show for it),
      we will discontinue our examination.
    
    
      The Countess, when she had dropped the letter in the bag, returned to her
      chamber, and deputed Dorothy Loring, whom she met on the stairs, to run
      and request Rose to lend her her album to beguile the afternoon with; and
      Dorothy dances to Rose, saying, 'The Countess de Lispy-Lispy would be
      delighted to look at your album all the afternoon.'
    
    
      'Oh what a woman that is!' says Rose. 'Countess de Lazy-Lazy, I think.'
    
    
      The Countess, had she been listening, would have cared little for
      accusations on that head. Idlesse was fashionable: exquisite languors were
      a sign of breeding; and she always had an idea that she looked more
      interesting at dinner after reclining on a couch the whole of the
      afternoon. The great Mel and his mate had given her robust health, and she
      was able to play the high-born invalid without damage to her constitution.
      Anything amused her; Rose's album even, and the compositions of W. H., E.
      H., D. F., and F. L. The initials F. L. were diminutive, and not unlike
      her own hand, she thought. They were appended to a piece of facetiousness
      that would not have disgraced the abilities of Mr. John Raikes; but we
      know that very stiff young gentlemen betray monkey-minds when sweet young
      ladies compel them to disport. On the whole, it was not a lazy afternoon
      that the Countess passed, and it was not against her wish that others
      should think it was.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XX. BREAK-NECK LEAP
    
    
      The August sun was in mid-sky, when a troop of ladies and cavaliers issued
      from the gates of Beckley Court, and winding through the hopgardens,
      emerged on the cultivated slopes bordering the downs. Foremost, on her
      grey cob, was Rose, having on her right her uncle Seymour, and on her left
      Ferdinand Laxley. Behind came Mrs. Evremonde, flanked by Drummond and
      Evan. Then followed Jenny Graine, supported by Harry and William Harvey.
      In the rear came an open carriage, in which Miss Carrington and the
      Countess de Saldar were borne, attended by Lady Jocelyn and Andrew
      Cogglesby on horseback. The expedition had for its object the selection of
      a run of ground for an amateur steeple-chase: the idea of which had sprung
      from Laxley's boasts of his horsemanship: and Rose, quick as fire, had
      backed herself, and Drummond and Evan, to beat him. The mention of the
      latter was quite enough for Laxley.
    
    
      'If he follows me, let him take care of his neck,' said that youth.
    
    
      'Why, Ferdinand, he can beat you in anything!' exclaimed Rose,
      imprudently.
    
    
      But the truth was, she was now more restless than ever. She was not
      distant with Evan, but she had a feverish manner, and seemed to thirst to
      make him show his qualities, and excel, and shine. Billiards, or jumping,
      or classical acquirements, it mattered not       Evan must come first. He
      had crossed the foils with Laxley, and disarmed him; for Mel his father
      had seen him trained for a military career. Rose made a noise about the
      encounter, and Laxley was eager for his opportunity, which he saw in the
      proposed mad gallop.
    
    
      Now Mr. George Uplift, who usually rode in buckskins whether he was after
      the fox or fresh air, was out on this particular morning; and it happened
      that, as the cavalcade wound beneath the down, Mr. George trotted along
      the ridge. He was a fat-faced, rotund young squire       a bully where he
      might be, and an obedient creature enough where he must be       good-humoured
      when not interfered with; fond of the table, and brimful of all the jokes
      of the county, the accent of which just seasoned his speech. He had
      somehow plunged into a sort of half-engagement with Miss Carrington. At
      his age, and to ladies of Miss Carrington's age, men unhappily do not
      plunge head-foremost, or Miss Carrington would have had him long before.
      But he was at least in for it half a leg; and a desperate maiden, on the
      criminal side of thirty, may make much of that. Previous to the visit of
      the Countess de Saldar, Mr. George had been in the habit of trotting over
      to Beckley three or four times a week. Miss Carrington had a little money:
      Mr. George was heir to his uncle. Miss Carrington was lean and blue-eyed.
    
    
      Mr. George was black-eyed and obese. By everybody, except Mr. George, the
      match was made: but that exception goes for little in the country, where
      half the population are talked into marriage, and gossips entirely devote
      themselves to continuing the species. Mr. George was certain that he had
      not been fighting shy of the fair Carrington of late, nor had he been
      unfaithful. He had only been in an extraordinary state of occupation.
      Messages for Lady Racial had to be delivered, and he had become her
      cavalier and escort suddenly. The young squire was bewildered; but as he
      was only one leg in love       if the sentiment may be thus spoken of
      figuratively       his vanity in his present office kept him from remorse
      or uneasiness.
    
    
      He rode at an easy pace within sight of the home of his treasure, and his
      back turned to it. Presently there rose a cry from below. Mr. George
      looked about. The party of horsemen hallooed: Mr. George yoicked. Rose set
      her horse to gallop up; Seymour Jocelyn cried 'fox,' and gave the view;
      hearing which Mr. George shouted, and seemed inclined to surrender; but
      the fun seized him, and, standing up in his stirrups, he gathered his
      coat-tails in a bunch, and waggled them with a jolly laugh, which was
      taken up below, and the clamp of hoofs resounded on the turf as Mr. George
      led off, after once more, with a jocose twist in his seat, showing them
      the brush mockingly. Away went fox, and a mad chase began. Seymour acted
      as master of the hunt. Rose, Evan, Drummond, and Mrs. Evremonde and
      Dorothy, skirted to the right, all laughing, and full of excitement. Harry
      bellowed the direction from above. The ladies in the carriage, with Lady
      Jocelyn and Andrew, watched them till they flowed one and all over the
      shoulder of the down.
    
    
      'And who may the poor hunted animal be?' inquired the Countess.
    
    
      'George Uplift,' said Lady Jocelyn, pulling out her watch. 'I give him
      twenty minutes.'
    
    
      'Providence speed him!' breathed the Countess, with secret fervour.
    
    
      'Oh, he hasn't a chance,' said Lady Jocelyn. 'The squire keeps wretched
      beasts.'
    
    
      'Is there not an attraction that will account for his hasty capture?' said
      the Countess, looking tenderly at Miss Carrington, who sat a little
      straighter, and the Countess, hating manifestations of stiff-backedness,
      could not forbear adding: 'I am at war with my sympathies, which should be
      with the poor brute flying from his persecutors.'
    
    
      She was in a bitter state of trepidation, or she would have thought twice
      before she touched a nerve of the enamoured lady, as she knew she did in
      calling her swain a poor brute, and did again by pertinaciously pursuing:
    
    
      'Does he then shun his captivity?'
    
    
      'Touching a nerve' is one of those unforgivable small offences which, in
      our civilized state, produce the social vendettas and dramas that, with
      savage nations, spring from the spilling of blood. Instead of an eye for
      an eye, a tooth for a tooth, we demand a nerve for a nerve. 'Thou hast
      touched me where I am tender thee, too, will I touch.'
    
    
      Miss Carrington had been alarmed and hurt at the strange evasion of Mr.
      George; nor could she see the fun of his mimicry of the fox and his flight
      away from instead of into her neighbourhood. She had also, or she now
      thought it, remarked that when Mr. George had been spoken of casually, the
      Countess had not looked a natural look. Perhaps it was her present
      inflamed fancy. At any rate the Countess was offensive now. She was
      positively vulgar, in consequence, to the mind of Miss Carrington, and
      Miss Carrington was drawn to think of a certain thing Ferdinand Laxley had
      said he had heard from the mouth of this lady's brother when ale was in
      him. Alas! how one seed of a piece of folly will lurk and sprout to
      confound us; though, like the cock in the eastern tale, we peck up
      zealously all but that one!
    
    
      The carriage rolled over the turf, attended by Andrew, and Lady Jocelyn,
      and the hunt was seen; Mr. George some forty paces a-head; Seymour gaining
      on him, Rose next.
    
    
      'Who's that breasting Rose?' said Lady Jocelyn, lifting her glass.
    
    
      'My brother-in-law, Harrington,' returned Andrew.
    
    
      'He doesn't ride badly,' said Lady Jocelyn. 'A little too military. He
      must have been set up in England.'
    
    
      'Oh, Evan can do anything,' said Andrew enthusiastically. 'His father was
      a capital horseman, and taught him fencing, riding, and every
      accomplishment. You won't find such a young fellow, my lady       '
    
    
      'The brother like him at all?' asked Lady Jocelyn, still eyeing the chase.
    
    
      'Brother? He hasn't got a brother,' said Andrew.
    
    
      Lady Jocelyn continued: 'I mean the present baronet.'
    
    
      She was occupied with her glass, and did not observe the flush that took
      hold of Andrew's ingenuous cheeks, and his hurried glance at and off the
      quiet eye of the Countess. Miss Carrington did observe it.
    
    
      Mr. Andrew dashed his face under the palm of his hand, and murmured:
    
    
      'Oh-yes! His brother-in-law isn't much like him       ha! ha!'
    
    
      And then the poor little man rubbed his hands, unconscious of the
      indignant pity for his wretched abilities in the gaze of the Countess; and
      he must have been exposed       there was a fear that the ghost of Sir
      Abraham would have darkened this day, for Miss Carrington was about to
      speak, when Lady Jocelyn cried: 'There's a purl! Somebody's down.'
    
    
      The Countess was unaware of the nature of a purl, but she could have sworn
      it to be a piece of Providence.
    
    
      'Just by old Nat Hodges' farm, on Squire Copping's ground,' cried Andrew,
      much relieved by the particular individual's misfortune. 'Dear me, my
      lady! how old Tom and I used to jump the brook there, to be sure! and when
      you were no bigger than little Miss Loring       do you remember old Tom?
      We're all fools one time in our lives!'
    
    
      'Who can it be?' said Lady Jocelyn, spying at the discomfited horseman.
      'I'm afraid it's poor Ferdinand.'
    
    
      They drove on to an eminence from which the plain was entirely laid open.
    
    
      'I hope my brother will enjoy his ride this day,' sighed the Countess. 'It
      will be his limit of enjoyment for a lengthened period!'
    
    
      She perceived that Mr. George's capture was inevitable, and her heart
      sank; for she was sure he would recognize her, and at the moment she
      misdoubted her powers. She dreamed of flight.
    
    
      'You're not going to leave us?' said Lady Jocelyn. 'My dear Countess, what
      will the future member do without you? We have your promise to stay till
      the election is over.'
    
    
      'Thanks for your extreme kind courtesy, Lady Jocelyn,' murmured the
      Countess: 'but my husband       the Count.'
    
    
      'The favour is yours,' returned her ladyship. 'And if the Count cannot
      come, you at least are at liberty?'
    
    
      'You are most kind,' said the Countess.
    
    
      'Andrew and his wife I should not dare to separate for more than a week,'
      said Lady Jocelyn. 'He is the great British husband. The proprietor! "My
      wife" is his unanswerable excuse.'
    
    
      'Yes,' Andrew replied cheerily. 'I don't like division between man and
      wife, I must say.'
    
    
      The Countess dared no longer instance the Count, her husband. She was
      heard to murmur that citizen feelings were not hers:
    
    
      'You suggested Fallow field to Melville, did you not?' asked Lady Jocelyn.
    
    
      'It was the merest suggestion,' said the Countess, smiling.
    
    
      'Then you must really stay to see us through it,' said her ladyship.
      'Where are they now? They must be making straight for break-neck fence.
      They'll have him there. George hasn't pluck for that.'
    
    
      'Hasn't what?'
    
    
      It was the Countess who requested to know the name of this other piece of
      Providence Mr. George Uplift was deficient in.
    
    
      'Pluck-go,' said her ladyship hastily, and telling the coachman to drive
      to a certain spot, trotted on with Andrew, saying to him: 'I'm afraid we
      are thought vulgar by the Countess.'
    
    
      Andrew considered it best to reassure her gravely.
    
    
      'The young man, her brother, is well-bred,' said Lady Jocelyn, and Andrew
      was very ready to praise Evan.
    
    
      Lady Jocelyn, herself in slimmer days a spirited horsewoman, had correctly
      estimated Mr. George's pluck. He was captured by Harry and Evan close on
      the leap, in the act of shaking his head at it; and many who inspected the
      leap would have deemed it a sign that wisdom weighted the head that would
      shake long at it; for it consisted of a post and rails, with a double
      ditch.
    
    
      Seymour Jocelyn, Mrs. Evremonde, Drummond, Jenny Graine, and William
      Harvey, rode with Mr. George in quest of the carriage, and the captive was
      duly delivered over.
    
    
      'But where's the brush?' said Lady Jocelyn, laughing, and introducing him
      to the Countess, who dropped her head, and with it her veil.
    
    
      'Oh! they leave that on for my next run,' said Mr. George, bowing civilly.
    
    
      'You are going to run again?'
    
    
      Miss Carrington severely asked this question; and Mr. George protested.
    
    
      'Secure him, Louisa,' said Lady Jocelyn. 'See here: what's the matter with
      poor Dorothy?'
    
    
      Dorothy came slowly trotting up to them along the green lane, and thus
      expressed her grief, between sobs:
    
    
      'Isn't it a shame? Rose is such a tyrant. They're going to ride a race and
      a jump down in the field, and it's break-neck leap, and Rose won't allow
      me to stop and see it, though she knows I'm just as fond of Evan as she
      is; and if he's killed I declare it will be her fault; and it's all for
      her stupid, dirty old pocket handkerchief!'
    
    
      'Break-neck fence!' said Lady Jocelyn; 'that's rather mad.'
    
    
      'Do let's go and see it, darling Aunty Joey,' pleaded the little maid.
      Lady Jocelyn rode on, saying to herself: 'That girl has a great deal of
      devil in her.' The lady's thoughts were of Rose.
    
    
      'Black Lymport'd take the leap,' said Mr. George, following her with the
      rest of the troop. 'Who's that fellow on him?'
    
    
      'His name's Harrington,' quoth Drummond.
    
    
      'Oh, Harrington!' Mr. George responded; but immediately laughed       'Harrington?
      'Gad, if he takes the leap it'll be odd       another of the name. That's
      where old Mel had his spill.'
    
    
      'Who?' Drummond inquired.
    
    
      'Old Mel Harrington       the Lymport wonder. Old Marquis Mel,' said Mr.
      George. 'Haven't ye heard of him?'
    
    
      'What! the gorgeous tailor!' exclaimed Lady Jocelyn. 'How I regret never
      meeting that magnificent snob! that efflorescence of sublime imposture!
      I've seen the Regent; but one's life doesn't seem complete without having
      seen his twin-brother. You must give us warning when you have him down at
      Croftlands again, Mr. George.'
    
    
      'Gad, he'll have to come a long distance       poor old Mel!' said Mr.
      George; and was going on, when Seymour Jocelyn stroked his moustache to
      cry, 'Look! Rosey 's starting 'em, by Jove!'
    
    
      The leap, which did not appear formidable from where they stood, was four
      fields distant from the point where Rose, with a handkerchief in her hand,
      was at that moment giving the signal to Laxley and Evan.
    
    
      Miss Carrington and the Countess begged Lady Jocelyn to order a shout to
      be raised to arrest them, but her ladyship marked her good sense by
      saying: 'Let them go, now they're about it'; for she saw that to make a
      fuss now matters had proceeded so far, was to be uncivil to the
      inevitable.
    
    
      The start was given, and off they flew. Harry Jocelyn, behind them, was
      evidently caught by the demon, and clapped spurs to his horse to have his
      fling as well, for the fun of the thing; but Rose, farther down the field,
      rode from her post straight across him, to the imminent peril of a mutual
      overset; and the party on the height could see Harry fuming, and Rose
      coolly looking him down, and letting him understand what her will was; and
      her mother, and Drummond, and Seymour who beheld this, had a common
      sentiment of admiration for the gallant girl. But away went the rivals.
      Black Lymport was the favourite, though none of the men thought he would
      be put at the fence. The excitement became contagious. The Countess threw
      up her veil. Lady Jocelyn, and Seymour, and Drummond, galloped down the
      lane, and Mr. George was for accompanying them, till the line of Miss
      Carrington's back gave him her unmistakeable opinion of such a course of
      conduct, and he had to dally and fret by her side. Andrew's arm was
      tightly grasped by the Countess. The rivals were crossing the second
      field, Laxley a little a-head.
    
    
      'He 's holding in the black mare       that fellow!' said Mr. George.
      'Gad, it looks like going at the fence. Fancy Harrington!'
    
    
      They were now in the fourth field, a smooth shorn meadow. Laxley was two
      clear lengths in advance, but seemed riding, as Mr. George remarked, more
      for pace than to take the jump. The ladies kept plying random queries and
      suggestions: the Countess wishing to know whether they could not be
      stopped by a countryman before they encountered any danger. In the midst
      of their chatter, Mr. George rose in his stirrups, crying:
    
    
      'Bravo, the black mare!'
    
    
      'Has he done it?' said Andrew, wiping his poll.
    
    
      'He? No, the mare!' shouted Mr. George, and bolted off, no longer to be
      restrained.
    
    
      The Countess, doubly relieved, threw herself back in the carriage, and
      Andrew drew a breath, saying: 'Evan has beat him       I saw that! The
      other's horse swerved right round.'
    
    
      'I fear,' said Mrs. Evremonde, 'Mr. Harrington has had a fall. Don't be
      alarmed       it may not be much.'
    
    
      'A fall!' exclaimed the Countess, equally divided between alarms of
      sisterly affection and a keen sense of the romance of the thing.
    
    
      Miss Carrington ordered the carriage to be driven round. They had not gone
      far when they were met by Harry Jocelyn riding in hot haste, and he
      bellowed to the coachman to drive as hard as he could, and stop opposite
      Brook's farm.
    
    
      The scene on the other side of the fence would have been a sweet one to
      the central figure in it had his eyes then been open. Surrounded by Lady
      Jocelyn, Drummond, Seymour, and the rest, Evan's dust-stained body was
      stretched along the road, and his head was lying in the lap of Rose, who,
      pale, heedless of anything spoken by those around her, and with her lips
      set and her eyes turning wildly from one to the other, held a gory
      handkerchief to his temple with one hand, and with the other felt for the
      motion of his heart.
    
    
      But heroes don't die, you know.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XXI. TRIBULATIONS AND TACTICS OF THE COUNTESS
    
    
      'You have murdered my brother, Rose Jocelyn!'
    
    
      'Don't say so now.'
    
    
      Such was the interchange between the two that loved the senseless youth,
      as he was being lifted into the carriage.
    
    
      Lady Jocelyn sat upright in her saddle, giving directions about what was
      to be done with Evan and the mare, impartially.
    
    
      'Stunned, and a good deal shaken, I suppose; Lymport's knees are terribly
      cut,' she said to Drummond, who merely nodded. And Seymour remarked,
      'Fifty guineas knocked off her value!' One added, 'Nothing worse, I should
      think'; and another, 'A little damage inside, perhaps.' Difficult to say
      whether they spoke of Evan or the brute.
    
    
      No violent outcries; no reproaches cast on the cold-blooded coquette; no
      exclamations on the heroism of her brother! They could absolutely spare a
      thought for the animal! And Evan had risked his life for this, and might
      die unpitied. The Countess diversified her grief with a deadly bitterness
      against the heartless Jocelyns.
    
    
      Oh, if Evan dies! will it punish Rose sufficiently?
    
    
      Andrew expressed emotion, but not of a kind the Countess liked a relative
      to be seen exhibiting; for in emotion worthy Andrew betrayed to her his
      origin offensively.
    
    
      'Go away and puke, if you must,' she said, clipping poor Andrew's word
      about his 'dear boy.' She could not help speaking in that way       he was
      so vulgar. A word of sympathy from Lady Jocelyn might have saved her from
      the sourness into which her many conflicting passions were resolving; and
      might also have saved her ladyship from the rancour she had sown in the
      daughter of the great Mel by her selection of epithets to characterize
      him.
    
    
      Will it punish Rose at all, if Evan dies?
    
    
      Rose saw that she was looked at. How could the Countess tell that Rose
      envied her the joy of holding Evan in the carriage there? Rose, to judge
      by her face, was as calm as glass. Not so well seen through, however. Mrs.
      Evremonde rode beside her, whose fingers she caught, and twined her own
      with them tightly once for a fleeting instant. Mrs. Evremonde wanted no
      further confession of her state.
    
    
      Then Rose said to her mother, 'Mama, may I ride to have the doctor ready?'
    
    
      Ordinarily, Rose would have clapped heel to horse the moment the thought
      came. She waited for the permission, and flew off at a gallop, waving back
      Laxley, who was for joining her.
    
    
      'Franks will be a little rusty about the mare,' the Countess heard Lady
      Jocelyn say; and Harry just then stooped his head to the carriage, and
      said, in his blunt fashion, 'After all, it won't show much.'
    
    
      'We are not cattle!' exclaimed the frenzied Countess, within her bosom.
      Alas! it was almost a democratic outcry they made her guilty of; but she
      was driven past patience. And as a further provocation, Evan would open
      his eyes. She laid her handkerchief over them with loving delicacy,
      remembering in a flash that her own face had been all the while exposed to
      Mr. George Uplift; and then the terrors of his presence at Beckley Court
      came upon her, and the fact that she had not for the last ten minutes been
      the serene Countess de Saldar; and she quite hated Andrew, for vulgarity
      in others evoked vulgarity in her, which was the reason why she ranked
      vulgarity as the chief of the deadly sins. Her countenance for Harry and
      all the others save poor Andrew was soon the placid heaven-confiding
      sister's again; not before Lady Jocelyn had found cause to observe to
      Drummond:
    
    
      'Your Countess doesn't ruffle well.'
    
    
      But a lady who is at war with two or three of the facts of Providence, and
      yet will have Providence for her ally, can hardly ruffle well. Do not
      imagine that the Countess's love for her brother was hollow. She was
      assured when she came up to the spot where he fell, that there was no
      danger; he had but dislocated his shoulder, and bruised his head a little.
      Hearing this, she rose out of her clamorous heart, and seized the
      opportunity for a small burst of melodrama. Unhappily, Lady Jocelyn, who
      gave the tone to the rest, was a Spartan in matters of this sort; and as
      she would have seen those dearest to her bear the luck of the field, she
      could see others. When the call for active help reached her, you beheld a
      different woman.
    
    
      The demonstrativeness the Countess thirsted for was afforded her by Juley
      Bonner, and in a measure by her sister Caroline, who loved Evan
      passionately. The latter was in riding attire, about to mount to ride and
      meet them, accompanied by the Duke. Caroline had hastily tied up her hair;
      a rich golden brown lump of it hung round her cheek; her limpid eyes and
      anxiously-nerved brows impressed the Countess wonderfully as she ran down
      the steps and bent her fine well-filled bust forward to ask the first
      hurried question.
    
    
      The Countess patted her shoulder. 'Safe, dear,' she said aloud, as one who
      would not make much of it. And in a whisper, 'You look superb.'
    
    
      I must charge it to Caroline's beauty under the ducal radiance, that a
      stream of sweet feelings entering into the Countess made her forget to
      tell her sister that George Uplift was by. Caroline had not been abroad,
      and her skin was not olive-hued; she was a beauty, and a majestic figure,
      little altered since the day when the wooden marine marched her out of
      Lymport.
    
    
      The Countess stepped from the carriage to go and cherish Juliana's
      petulant distress; for that unhealthy little body was stamping with
      impatience to have the story told to her, to burst into fits of pathos;
      and while Seymour and Harry assisted Evan to descend, trying to laugh off
      the pain he endured, Caroline stood by, soothing him with words and tender
      looks.
    
    
      Lady Jocelyn passed him, and took his hand, saying, 'Not killed this
      time!'
    
    
      'At your ladyship's service to-morrow,' he replied, and his hand was
      kindly squeezed.
    
    
      'My darling Evan, you will not ride again?' Caroline cried, kissing him on
      the steps; and the Duke watched the operation, and the Countess observed
      the Duke.
    
    
      That Providence should select her sweetest moments to deal her wounds, was
      cruel; but the Countess just then distinctly heard Mr. George Uplift ask
      Miss Carrington.
    
    
      'Is that lady a Harrington?'
    
    
      'You perceive a likeness?' was the answer.
    
    
      Mr. George went 'Whew!       tit-tit-tit!' with the profound expression of
      a very slow mind.
    
    
      The scene was quickly over. There was barely an hour for the ladies to
      dress for dinner. Leaving Evan in the doctor's hand, and telling Caroline
      to dress in her room, the Countess met Rose, and gratified her
      vindictiveness, while she furthered her projects, by saying:
    
    
      'Not till my brother is quite convalescent will it be adviseable that you
      should visit him. I am compelled to think of him entirely now. In his
      present state he is not fit to be, played with.'
    
    
      Rose, stedfastly eyeing her, seemed to swallow down something in her
      throat, and said:
    
    
      'I will obey you, Countess. I hoped you would allow me to nurse him.'
    
    
      'Quiet above all things, Rose Jocelyn!' returned the Countess, with the
      suavity of a governess, who must be civil in her sourness. 'If you would
      not complete this morning's achievement       stay away.'
    
    
      The Countess declined to see that Rose's lip quivered. She saw an
      unpleasantness in the bottom of her eyes; and now that her brother's
      decease was not even remotely to be apprehended, she herself determined to
      punish the cold, unimpressionable coquette of a girl. Before returning to
      Caroline, she had five minutes' conversation with. Juliana, which fully
      determined her to continue the campaign at Beckley Court, commence
      decisive movements, and not to retreat, though fifty George Uplofts
      menaced her. Consequently, having dismissed Conning on a message to Harry
      Jocelyn, to ask him for a list of the names of the new people they were to
      meet that day at dinner, she said to Caroline:
    
    
      'My dear, I think it will be incumbent on us to depart very quickly.'
    
    
      Much to the Countess's chagrin and astonishment, Caroline replied:
    
    
      'I shall hardly be sorry.'
    
    
      'Not sorry? Why, what now, dear one? Is it true, then, that a flagellated
      female kisses the rod? Are you so eager for a repetition of Strike?'
    
    
      Caroline, with some hesitation, related to her more than the Countess had
      ventured to petition for in her prayers.
    
    
      'Oh! how exceedingly generous!' the latter exclaimed. How very refreshing
      to think that there are nobles in your England as romantic, as courteous,
      as delicate as our own foreign ones! But his Grace is quite an exceptional
      nobleman. Are you not touched, dearest Carry?'
    
    
      Caroline pensively glanced at the reflection of her beautiful arm in the
      glass, and sighed, pushing back the hair from her temples.
    
    
      'But, for mercy's sake!' resumed the Countess, in alarm at the sigh, 'do
      not be too       too touched. Do, pray, preserve your wits. You weep!
      Caroline, Caroline! O my goodness; it is just five-and-twenty minutes to
      the first dinner-bell, and you are crying! For God's sake, think of your
      face! Are you going to be a Gorgon? And you show the marks twice as long
      as any other, you fair women. Squinnying like this! Caroline, for your
      Louisa's sake, do not!'
    
    
      Hissing which, half angrily and half with entreaty, the Countess dropped
      on her knees. Caroline's fit of tears subsided. The eldest of the sisters,
      she was the kindest, the fairest, the weakest.
    
    
      'Not,' said the blandishing Countess, when Caroline's face was clearer,
      'not that my best of Carrys does not look delicious in her shower. Cry,
      with your hair down, and you would subdue any male creature on two legs.
      And that reminds me of that most audacious Marquis de Remilla. He saw a
      dirty drab of a fruit-girl crying in Lisbon streets one day, as he was
      riding in the carriage of the Duchesse de Col da Rosta, and her husband
      and duena, and he had a letter for her       the Duchesse. They loved! How
      deliver the letter? "Save me!" he cried to the Duchesse, catching her
      hand, and pressing his heart, as if very sick. The Duchesse felt the paper       turned
      her hand over on her knee, and he withdrew his. What does my Carry think
      was the excuse he tendered the Duke? This       and this gives you some
      idea of the wonderful audacity of those dear Portuguese       that he       he
      must precipitate himself and marry any woman he saw weep, and be her slave
      for the term of his natural life, unless another woman's hand at the same
      moment restrained him! There!' and the Countess's eyes shone brightly.
    
    
      'How excessively imbecile!' Caroline remarked, hitherto a passive listener
      to these Lusitanian contes.
    
    
      It was the first sign she had yet given of her late intercourse with a
      positive Duke, and the Countess felt it, and drew back. No more anecdotes
      for Caroline, to whom she quietly said:
    
    
      'You are very English, dear!'
    
    
      'But now, the Duke       his Grace,' she went on, 'how did he inaugurate?'
    
    
      'I spoke to him of Evan's position. God forgive me!       I said that was
      the cause of my looks being sad.'
    
    
      'You could have thought of nothing better,' interposed the Countess.
      'Yes?'
    
    
      'He said, if he might clear them he should be happy!
    
    
      'In exquisite language, Carry, of course.'
    
    
      'No; just as others talk.'
    
    
      'Hum!' went the Countess, and issued again brightly from a cloud of
      reflection, with the remark: 'It was to seem business-like       the
      commerciality of the English mind. To the point       I know. Well, you
      perceive, my sweetest, that Evan's interests are in your hands. You dare
      not quit the field. In one week, I fondly trust, he will be secure. What
      more did his Grace say? May we not be the repository of such delicious
      secresies?'
    
    
      Caroline gave tremulous indications about the lips, and the Countess
      jumped to the bell and rang it, for they were too near dinner for the
      trace of a single tear to be permitted. The bell and the appearance of
      Conning effectually checked the flood.
    
    
      While speaking to her sister, the Countess had hesitated to mention George
      Uplift's name, hoping that, as he had no dinner-suit, he would not stop to
      dinner that day, and would fall to the charge of Lady Racial once more.
      Conning, however, brought in a sheet of paper on which the names of the
      guests were written out by Harry, a daily piece of service he performed
      for the captivating dame, and George Uplift's name was in the list.
    
    
      'We will do the rest, Conning-retire,' she said, and then folding Caroline
      in her arms, murmured, the moment they were alone, 'Will my Carry dress
      her hair plain to-day, for the love of her Louisa?'
    
    
      'Goodness! what a request!' exclaimed Caroline, throwing back her head to
      see if her Louisa could be serious.
    
    
      'Most inexplicable       is it not? Will she do it?'
    
    
      'Flat, dear? It makes a fright of me.'
    
    
      'Possibly. May I beg it?'
    
    
      'But why, dearest, why? If I only knew why!'
    
    
      'For the love of your Louy.'
    
    
      'Plain along the temples?'
    
    
      'And a knot behind.'
    
    
      'And a band along the forehead?'
    
    
      'Gems, if they meet your favour.'
    
    
      'But my cheek-bones, Louisa?'
    
    
      'They are not too prominent, Carry.'
    
    
      'Curls relieve them.'
    
    
      'The change will relieve the curls, dear one.'
    
    
      Caroline looked in the glass, at the Countess, as polished a reflector,
      and fell into a chair. Her hair was accustomed to roll across her
      shoulders in heavy curls. The Duke would find a change of the sort
      singular. She should not at all know herself with her hair done
      differently: and for a lovely woman to be transformed to a fright is hard
      to bear in solitude, or in imagination.
    
    
      'Really!' she petitioned.
    
    
      'Really       yes, or no?' added the Countess.
    
    
      'So unaccountable a whim!' Caroline looked in the glass dolefully, and
      pulled up her thick locks from one cheek, letting them fall on the
      instant.
    
    
      'She will?' breathed the Countess.
    
    
      'I really cannot,' said Caroline, with vehemence.
    
    
      The Countess burst into laughter, replying: 'My poor child! it is not my
      whim       it is your obligation. George Uplift dines here to-day. Now do
      you divine it? Disguise is imperative for you.'
    
    
      Mrs. Strike, gazing in her sister's face, answered slowly, 'George? But
      how will you meet him?' she hurriedly asked.
    
    
      'I have met him,' rejoined the Countess, boldly. 'I defy him to know me. I
      brazen him! You with your hair in my style are equally safe. You see there
      is no choice. Pooh! contemptible puppy!'
    
    
      'But I never,'       Caroline was going to say she never could face him.
      'I will not dine. I will nurse Evan.'
    
    
      'You have faced him, my dear,' said the Countess, 'and you are to change
      your head-dress simply to throw him off his scent.'
    
    
      As she spoke the Countess tripped about, nodding her head like a girl.
      Triumph in the sense of her power over all she came in contact with,
      rather elated the lady.
    
    
      Do you see why she worked her sister in this roundabout fashion? She would
      not tell her George Uplift was in the house till she was sure he intended
      to stay, for fear of frightening her. When the necessity became apparent,
      she put it under the pretext of a whim in order to see how far Caroline,
      whose weak compliance she could count on, and whose reticence concerning
      the Duke annoyed her, would submit to it to please her sister; and if she
      rebelled positively, why to be sure it was the Duke she dreaded to shock:
      and, therefore, the Duke had a peculiar hold on her: and, therefore, the
      Countess might reckon that she would do more than she pleased to confess
      to remain with the Duke, and was manageable in that quarter. All this she
      learnt without asking. I need not add, that Caroline sighingly did her
      bidding.
    
    
      'We must all be victims in our turn, Carry,' said the Countess. 'Evan's
      prospects       it may be, Silva's restoration       depend upon your hair
      being dressed plain to-day. Reflect on that!'
    
    
      Poor Caroline obeyed; but she was capable of reflecting only that her face
      was unnaturally lean and strange to her.
    
    
      The sisters tended and arranged one another, taking care to push their
      mourning a month or two ahead and the Countess animadverted on the vulgar
      mind of Lady Jocelyn, who would allow a 'gentleman to sit down at a
      gentlewoman's table, in full company, in pronounced undress': and
      Caroline, utterly miserable, would pretend that she wore a mask and kept
      grimacing as they do who are not accustomed to paint on the cheeks, till
      the Countess checked her by telling her she should ask her for that before
      the Duke.
    
    
      After a visit to Evan, the sisters sailed together into the drawing-room.
    
    
      'Uniformity is sometimes a gain,' murmured the Countess, as they were
      parting in the middle of the room. She saw that their fine figures, and
      profiles, and resemblance in contrast, produced an effect. The Duke wore
      one of those calmly intent looks by which men show they are aware of
      change in the heavens they study, and are too devout worshippers to
      presume to disapprove. Mr. George was standing by Miss Carrington, and he
      also watched Mrs. Strike. To bewilder him yet more the Countess persisted
      in fixing her eyes upon his heterodox apparel, and Mr. George became
      conscious and uneasy. Miss Carrington had to address her question to him
      twice before he heard. Melville Jocelyn, Sir John Loring, Sir Franks, and
      Hamilton surrounded the Countess, and told her what they had decided on
      with regard to the election during the day; for Melville was warm in his
      assertion that they would not talk to the Countess five minutes without
      getting a hint worth having.
    
    
      'Call to us that man who is habited like a groom,' said the Countess,
      indicating Mr. George. 'I presume he is in his right place up here?'
    
    
      'Whew       take care, Countess       our best man. He's good for a
      dozen,' said Hamilton.
    
    
      Mr. George was brought over and introduced to the Countess de Saldar.
    
    
      'So the oldest Tory in the county is a fox?' she said, in allusion to the
      hunt. Never did Caroline Strike admire her sister's fearful genius more
      than at that moment.
    
    
      Mr. George ducked and rolled his hand over his chin, with 'ah-um!' and the
      like, ended by a dry laugh.
    
    
      'Are you our supporter, Mr. Uplift?'
    
    
      'Tory interest, ma       um       my lady.'
    
    
      'And are you staunch and may be trusted?'
    
    
      ''Pon my honour, I think I have that reputation.'
    
    
      'And you would not betray us if we give you any secrets? Say "'Pon my
      honour," again. You launch it out so courageously.'
    
    
      The men laughed, though they could not see what the Countess was driving
      at. She had for two minutes spoken as she spoke when a girl, and George       entirely
      off his guard and unsuspicious       looked unenlightened. If he knew,
      there were hints enough for him in her words.
    
    
      If he remained blind, they might pass as air. The appearance of the butler
      cut short his protestation as to his powers of secresy.
    
    
      The Countess dismissed him.
    
    
      'You will be taken into our confidence when we require you.' And she
      resumed her foreign air in a most elaborate and overwhelming bow.
    
    
      She was now perfectly satisfied that she was safe from Mr. George, and, as
      she thoroughly detested the youthful squire, she chose to propagate a
      laugh at him by saying with the utmost languor and clearness of voice, as
      they descended the stairs:
    
    
      'After all, a very clever fox may be a very dull dog       don't you
      think?'
    
    
      Gentlemen in front of her, and behind, heard it, and at Mr. George's
      expense her reputation rose.
    
    
      Thus the genius of this born general prompted her to adopt the principle
      in tactics       boldly to strike when you are in the dark as to your
      enemy's movements.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XXII. IN WHICH THE DAUGHTERS OF THE GREAT MEL HAVE TO DIGEST HIM
    
    
      AT DINNER
    
    
      You must know, if you would form an estimate of the Countess's heroic
      impudence, that a rumour was current in Lymport that the fair and
      well-developed Louisa Harrington, in her sixteenth year, did advisedly,
      and with the intention of rendering the term indefinite, entrust her
      guileless person to Mr. George Uplift's honourable charge. The rumour,
      unflavoured by absolute malignity, was such; and it went on to say, that
      the sublime Mel, alive to the honour of his family, followed the fugitives
      with a pistol, and with a horsewhip, that he might chastise the offender
      according to the degree of his offence. It was certain that he had not
      used the pistol: it was said that he had used the whip. The details of the
      interview between Mel and Mr. George were numerous, but at the same time
      various. Some declared that he put a pistol to Mr. George's ear, and under
      pressure of that persuader got him into the presence of a clergyman, when
      he turned sulky; and when the pistol was again produced, the ceremony
      would have been performed, had not the outraged Church cried out for help.
      Some vowed that Mr. George had referred all questions implying a
      difference between himself and Mel to their mutual fists for decision. At
      any rate, Mr. George turned up in Fallow field subsequently; the fair
      Louisa, unhurt and with a quiet mind, in Lymport; and this amount of truth
      the rumours can be reduced to       that Louisa and Mr. George had been
      acquainted. Rumour and gossip know how to build: they always have some
      solid foundation, however small. Upwards of twelve years had run since
      Louisa went to the wife of the brewer       a period quite long enough for
      Mr. George to forget any one in; and she was altogether a different
      creature; and, as it was true that Mr. George was a dull one, she was,
      after the test she had put him to, justified in hoping that Mel's progeny
      might pass unchallenged anywhere out of Lymport. So, with Mr. George
      facing her at table, the Countess sat down, determined to eat and be
      happy.
    
    
      A man with the education and tastes of a young country squire is not
      likely to know much of the character of women; and of the marvellous power
      they have of throwing a veil of oblivion between themselves and what they
      don't want to remember, few men know much. Mr. George had thought, when he
      saw Mrs. Strike leaning to Evan, and heard she was a Harrington, that she
      was rather like the Lymport family; but the reappearance of Mrs. Strike,
      the attention of the Duke of Belfield to her, and the splendid tactics of
      the Countess, which had extinguished every thought in the thought of
      himself, drove Lymport out of his mind.
    
    
      There were some dinner guests at the table-people of Fallow field,
      Beckley, and Bodley. The Countess had the diplomatist on one side, the
      Duke on the other. Caroline was under the charge of Sir Franks. The
      Countess, almost revelling in her position opposite Mr. George, was
      ambitious to lead the conversation, and commenced, smiling at Melville:
    
    
      'We are to be spared politics to-day? I think politics and cookery do not
      assimilate.'
    
    
      'I'm afraid you won't teach the true Briton to agree with you,' said
      Melville, shaking his head over the sums involved by this British
      propensity.
    
    
      'No,' said Seymour. 'Election dinners are a part of the Constitution': and
      Andrew laughed: 'They make Radicals pay as well as Tories, so it's pretty
      square.'
    
    
      The topic was taken up, flagged, fell, and was taken up again. And then
      Harry Jocelyn said:
    
    
      'I say, have you worked the flags yet? The great Mel must have his flags.'
    
    
      The flags were in the hands of ladies, and ladies would look to the
      rosettes, he was told.
    
    
      Then a lady of the name of Barrington laughed lightly, and said:
    
    
      'Only, pray, my dear Harry, don't call your uncle the "Great Mel" at the
      election.'
    
    
      'Oh! very well,' quoth Harry: 'why not?'
    
    
      'You 'll get him laughed at       that 's all.'
    
    
      'Oh! well, then, I won't,' said Harry, whose wits were attracted by the
      Countess's visage.
    
    
      Mrs. Barrington turned to Seymour, her neighbour, and resumed:
    
    
      'He really would be laughed at. There was a tailor       he was called the
      Great Mel       and he tried to stand for Fallow field once. I believe he
      had the support of Squire Uplift       George's uncle       and others.
      They must have done it for fun! Of course he did not get so far as the
      hustings; but I believe he had flags, and principles, and all sorts of
      things worked ready. He certainly canvassed.'
    
    
      'A tailor       canvassed       for Parliament?' remarked an old Dowager,
      the mother of Squire Copping. 'My what are we coming to next?'
    
    
      'He deserved to get in,' quoth Aunt Bel: 'After having his principles
      worked ready, to eject the man was infamous.'
    
    
      Amazed at the mine she had sprung, the Countess sat through it, lamenting
      the misery of owning a notorious father. Happily Evan was absent, on his
      peaceful blessed bed!
    
    
      Bowing over wine with the Duke, she tried another theme, while still, like
      a pertinacious cracker, the Great Mel kept banging up and down the table.
    
    
      'We are to have a feast in the open air, I hear. What you call pic-nic.'
    
    
      The Duke believed there was a project of the sort.
    
    
      'How exquisitely they do those things in Portugal! I suppose there would
      be no scandal in my telling something now. At least we are out of
      Court-jurisdiction.'
    
    
      'Scandal of the Court!' exclaimed his Grace, in mock horror.
    
    
      'The option is yours to listen. The Queen, when young, was sweetly pretty;
      a divine complexion; and a habit of smiling on everybody. I presume that
      the young Habral, son of the first magistrate of Lisbon, was also smiled
      on. Most innocently, I would swear! But it operated on the wretched youth!
      He spent all his fortune in the purchase and decoration of a fairy villa,
      bordering on the Val das Rosas, where the Court enjoyed its rustic
      festivities, and one day a storm! all the ladies hurried their young
      mistress to the house where the young Habral had been awaiting her for
      ages. None so polished as he! Musicians started up, the floors were ready,
      and torches beneath them!       there was a feast of exquisite wines and
      viands sparkling. Quite enchantment. The girl-Queen was in ecstasies. She
      deigned a dance with the young Habral, and then all sat down to supper;
      and in the middle of it came the cry of Fire! The Queen shrieked; the
      flames were seen all around; and if the arms of the young Habral were
      opened to save her, or perish, could she cast a thought on Royalty, and
      refuse? The Queen was saved the villa was burnt; the young Habral was
      ruined, but, if I know a Portuguese, he was happy till he died, and well
      remunerated! For he had held a Queen to his heart! So that was a pic-nic!'
    
    
      The Duke slightly inclined his head.
    
    
      'Vrai Portughez derrendo,' he said. 'They tell a similar story in Spain,
      of one of the Queens       I forget her name. The difference between us
      and your Peninsular cavaliers is, that we would do as much for uncrowned
      ladies.'
    
    
      'Ah! your Grace!' The Countess swam in the pleasure of a nobleman's
      compliment.
    
    
      'What's the story?' interposed Aunt Bel.
    
    
      An outline of it was given her. Thank heaven, the table was now rid of the
      Great Mel. For how could he have any, the remotest relation with Queens
      and Peninsular pic-nics? You shall hear.
    
    
      Lady Jocelyn happened to catch a word or two of the story.
    
    
      'Why,' said she, 'that's English! Franks, you remember the ballet
      divertissement they improvised at the Bodley race-ball, when the
      magnificent footman fired a curtain and caught up Lady Racial, and carried
      her       '
    
    
      'Heaven knows where!' cried Sir Franks. 'I remember it perfectly. It was
      said that the magnificent footman did it on purpose to have that
      pleasure.'
    
    
      'Ay, of course,' Hamilton took him up. 'They talked of prosecuting the
      magnificent footman.'
    
    
      'Ay,' followed Seymour, 'and nobody could tell where the magnificent
      footman bolted. He vanished into thin air.'
    
    
      'Ay, of course,' Melville struck in; 'and the magic enveloped the lady for
      some time.'
    
    
      At this point Mr. George Uplift gave a horse-laugh. He jerked in his seat
      excitedly.
    
    
      'Bodley race-ball!' he cried; and looking at Lady Jocelyn: 'Was your
      ladyship there, then? Why       ha! ha! why, you have seen the Great Mel,
      then! That tremendous footman was old Mel himself!'
    
    
      Lady Jocelyn struck both her hands on the table, and rested her large grey
      eyes, full of humorous surprise, on Mr. George.
    
    
      There was a pause, and then the ladies and gentlemen laughed.
    
    
      'Yes,' Mr. George went on, 'that was old Mel. I'll swear to him.'
    
    
      'And that's how it began?' murmured Lady Jocelyn.
    
    
      Mr. George nodded at his plate discreetly.
    
    
      'Well,' said Lady Jocelyn, leaning back, and lifting her face upward in
      the discursive fulness of her fancy, 'I feel I am not robbed. 'Il y a des
      miracles, et j'en ai vu'. One's life seems more perfect when one has seen
      what nature can do. The fellow was stupendous! I conceive him present.
      Who'll fire a house for me? Is it my deficiency of attraction, or a total
      dearth of gallant snobs?'
    
    
      The Countess was drowned. The muscles of her smiles were horribly stiff
      and painful. Caroline was getting pale. Could it be accident that thus
      resuscitated Mel, their father, and would not let the dead man die? Was
      not malice at the bottom of it? The Countess, though she hated Mr. George
      infinitely, was clear-headed enough to see that Providence alone was
      trying her. No glances were exchanged between him and Laxley, or Drummond.
    
    
      Again Mel returned to his peace, and again he had to come forth.
    
    
      'Who was this singular man you were speaking about just now?' Mrs.
      Evremonde asked.
    
    
      Lady Jocelyn answered her: 'The light of his age. The embodied protest
      against our social prejudice. Combine       say, Mirabeau and Alcibiades,
      and the result is the Lymport Tailor:       he measures your husband in
      the morning: in the evening he makes love to you, through a series of
      pantomimic transformations. He was a colossal Adonis, and I'm sorry he's
      dead!'
    
    
      'But did the man get into society?' said Mrs. Evremonde. 'How did he
      manage that?'
    
    
      'Yes, indeed! and what sort of a society!' the dowager Copping
      interjected. 'None but bachelor-tables, I can assure you. Oh! I remember
      him. They talked of fetching him to Dox Hall. I said, No, thank you, Tom;
      this isn't your Vauxhall.'
    
    
      'A sharp retort,' said Lady Jocelyn, 'a most conclusive rhyme; but you're
      mistaken. Many families were glad to see him, I hear. And he only
      consented to be treated like a footman when he dressed like one. The
      fellow had some capital points. He fought two or three duels, and behaved
      like a man. Franks wouldn't have him here, or I would have received him. I
      hear that, as a conteur, he was inimitable. In short, he was a robust
      Brummel, and the Regent of low life.'
    
    
      This should have been Mel's final epitaph.
    
    
      Unhappily, Mrs. Melville would remark, in her mincing manner, that the
      idea of the admission of a tailor into society seemed very unnatural; and
      Aunt Bel confessed that her experience did not comprehend it.
    
    
      'As to that,' said Lady Jocelyn, 'phenomena are unnatural. The rules of
      society are lightened by the exceptions. What I like in this Mel is, that
      though he was a snob, and an impostor, he could still make himself
      respected by his betters. He was honest, so far; he acknowledged his
      tastes, which were those of Franks, Melville, Seymour, and George       the
      tastes of a gentleman. I prefer him infinitely to your cowardly democrat,
      who barks for what he can't get, and is generally beastly. In fact, I'm
      not sure that I haven't a secret passion for the great tailor.'
    
    
      'After all, old Mel wasn't so bad,' Mr. George Uplift chimed in.
    
    
      'Granted a tailor       you didn't see a bit of it at table. I've known
      him taken for a lord. And when he once got hold of you, you couldn't give
      him up. The squire met him first in the coach, one winter. He took him for
      a Russian nobleman       didn't find out what he was for a month or so.
      Says Mel, "Yes, I make clothes. You find the notion unpleasant; guess how
      disagreeable it is to me." The old squire laughed, and was glad to have
      him at Croftlands as often as he chose to come. Old Mel and I used to spar
      sometimes; but he's gone, and I should like to shake his fist again.'
    
    
      Then Mr. George told the 'Bath' story, and episodes in Mel's career as
      Marquis; and while he held the ear of the table, Rose, who had not spoken
      a word, and had scarcely eaten a morsel during dinner, studied the sisters
      with serious eyes. Only when she turned them from the Countess to Mrs.
      Strike, they were softened by a shadowy drooping of the eyelids, as if for
      some reason she deeply pitied that lady.
    
    
      Next to Rose sat Drummond, with a face expressive of cynical enjoyment. He
      devoted uncommon attention to the Countess, whom he usually shunned and
      overlooked. He invited her to exchange bows over wine, in the fashion of
      that day, and the Countess went through the performance with finished
      grace and ease. Poor Andrew had all the time been brushing back his hair,
      and making strange deprecatory sounds in his throat, like a man who felt
      bound to assure everybody at table he was perfectly happy and comfortable.
    
    
      'Material enough for a Sartoriad,' said Drummond to Lady Jocelyn.
    
    
      'Excellent. Pray write it forthwith, Drummond', replied her ladyship; and
      as they exchanged talk unintelligible to the Countess, this lady observed
      to the Duke:
    
    
      'It is a relief to have buried that subject.'
    
    
      The Duke smiled, raising an eyebrow; but the persecuted Countess perceived
      she had been much too hasty when Drummond added,
    
    
      'I'll make a journey to Lymport in a day or two, and master his history.'
    
    
      'Do,' said her ladyship; and flourishing her hand, '"I sing the Prince of
      Snobs!"'
    
    
      'Oh, if it's about old Mel, I 'll sing you material enough,' said Mr.
      George. 'There! you talk of it's being unnatural, his dining out at
      respectable tables. Why, I believe       upon my honour, I believe it's a
      fact       he's supped and thrown dice with the Regent.'
    
    
      Lady Jocelyn clapped her hands. 'A noble culmination, Drummond! The man's
      an Epic!'
    
    
      'Well, I think old Mel was equal to it,' Mr. George pursued. 'He gave me
      pretty broad hints; and this is how it was, if it really happened, you
      know. Old Mel had a friend; some say he was more. Well, that was a fellow,
      a great gambler. I dare say you 've heard of him       Burley Bennet       him
      that won Ryelands Park of one of the royal dukes       died worth upwards
      of L100,000; and old Mel swore he ought to have had it, and would if he
      hadn't somehow offended him. He left the money to Admiral Harrington, and
      he was a relation of Mel's.'
    
    
      'But are we then utterly mixed up with tailors?' exclaimed Mrs.
      Barrington.
    
    
      'Well, those are the facts,' said Mr. George.
    
    
      The wine made the young squire talkative. It is my belief that his
      suspicions were not awake at that moment, and that, like any other young
      country squire, having got a subject he could talk on, he did not care to
      discontinue it. The Countess was past the effort to attempt to stop him.
      She had work enough to keep her smile in the right place.
    
    
      Every dinner may be said to have its special topic, just as every age has
      its marked reputation. They are put up twice or thrice, and have to
      contend with minor lights, and to swallow them, and then they command the
      tongues of men and flow uninterruptedly. So it was with the great Mel upon
      this occasion. Curiosity was aroused about him. Aunt Bel agreed with Lady
      Jocelyn that she would have liked to know the mighty tailor. Mrs. Shorne
      but very imperceptibly protested against the notion, and from one to
      another it ran. His Grace of Belfield expressed positive approval of Mel
      as one of the old school.
    
    
      'Si ce n'est pas le gentilhomme, au moins, c'est le gentilhomme manque,'
      said Lady Jocelyn. 'He is to be regretted, Duke. You are right. The stuff
      was in him, but the Fates were unkind. I stretch out my hand to the pauvre
      diable.'
    
    
      'I think one learns more from the mock magnifico than from anything else,'
      observed his Grace.
    
    
      'When the lion saw the donkey in his own royal skin, said Aunt Bel, 'add
      the rhyme at your discretion       he was a wiser lion, that's all.'
    
    
      'And the ape that strives to copy one       he's an animal of judgement,'
      said Lady Jocelyn. 'We will be tolerant to the tailor, and the Countess
      must not set us down as a nation of shopkeepers: philosophically
      tolerant.'
    
    
      The Countess started, and ran a little broken 'Oh!' affably out of her
      throat, dipped her lips to her tablenapkin, and resumed her smile.
    
    
      'Yes,' pursued her ladyship; 'old Mel stamps the age gone by. The gallant
      adventurer tied to his shop! Alternate footman and marquis, out of
      intermediate tailor! Isn't there something fine in his buffoon imitation
      of the real thing? I feel already that old Mel belongs to me. Where is the
      great man buried? Where have they, set the funeral brass that holds his
      mighty ashes?'
    
    
      Lady Jocelyn's humour was fully entered into by the men. The women smiled
      vacantly, and had a common thought that it was ill-bred of her to hold
      forth in that way at table, and unfeminine of any woman to speak
      continuously anywhere.
    
    
      'Oh, come!' cried Mr. George, who saw his own subject snapped away from
      him by sheer cleverness; 'old Mel wasn't only a buffoon, my lady, you
      know. Old Mel had his qualities. He was as much a "no-nonsense" fellow, in
      his way, as a magistrate, or a minister.'
    
    
      'Or a king, or a constable,' Aunt Bel helped his illustration.
    
    
      'Or a prince, a poll-parrot, a Perigord-pie,' added Drummond, whose
      gravity did not prevent Mr. George from seeing that he was laughed at.
    
    
      'Well, then, now, listen to this,' said Mr. George, leaning his two hands
      on the table resolutely. Dessert was laid, and, with a full glass beside
      him, and a pear to peel, he determined to be heard.
    
    
      The Countess's eyes went mentally up to the vindictive heavens. She stole
      a glance at Caroline, and was alarmed at her excessive pallor. Providence
      had rescued Evan from this!
    
    
      'Now, I know this to be true,' Mr. George began. 'When old Mel was alive,
      he and I had plenty of sparring, and that       but he's dead, and I'll do
      him justice. I spoke of Burley Bennet just now. Now, my lady, old Burley
      was, I think, Mel's half-brother, and he came, I know, somewhere out of
      Drury Lane-one of the courts near the theatre       I don't know much of
      London. However, old Mel wouldn't have that. Nothing less than being born
      in St. James's Square would content old Mel, and he must have a Marquis
      for his father. I needn't be more particular. Before ladies       ahem!
      But Burley was the shrewd hand of the two. Oh-h-h! such a card! He knew
      the way to get into company without false pretences. Well, I told you, he
      had lots more than L100,000       some said two       and he gave up
      Ryelands; never asked for it, though he won it. Consequence was, he
      commanded the services of somebody pretty high. And it was he got Admiral
      Harrington made a captain, posted, commodore, admiral, and K.C.B., all in
      seven years! In the Army it 'd have been half the time, for the H.R.H. was
      stronger in that department. Now, I know old Burley promised Mel to leave
      him his money, and called the Admiral an ungrateful dog. He didn't give
      Mel much at a time       now and then a twenty-pounder or so       I saw
      the cheques. And old Mel expected the money, and looked over his daughters
      like a turkey-cock. Nobody good enough for them. Whacking handsome gals       three!
      used to be called the Three Graces of Lymport. And one day Burley comes
      and visits Mel, and sees the girls. And he puts his finger on the eldest,
      I can tell you. She was a spanker! She was the handsomest gal, I think,
      ever I saw. For the mother's a fine woman, and what with the mother, and
      what with old Mel       '
    
    
      'We won't enter into the mysteries of origin,' quoth Lady Jocelyn.
    
    
      'Exactly, my lady. Oh, your servant, of course. Before ladies. A Burley
      Bennet, I said. Long and short was, he wanted to take her up to London.
      Says old Mel: "London 's a sad place."       "Place to make money," says
      Burley. "That's not work for a young gal," says Mel. Long and short was,
      Burley wanted to take her, and Mel wouldn't let her go.' Mr. George
      lowered his tone, and mumbled, 'Don't know how to explain it very well
      before ladies. What Burley wanted was       it wasn't quite honourable,
      you know, though there was a good deal of spangles on it, and whether a
      real H.R.H., or a Marquis, or a Viscount, I can't say, but       the offer
      was tempting to a tradesman. "No," says Mel; like a chap planting his
      flagstaff and sticking to it. I believe that to get her to go with him,
      Burley offered to make a will on the spot, and to leave every farthing of
      his money and property       upon my soul, I believe it to be true       to
      Mel and his family, if he'd let the gal go. "No," says Mel. I like the old
      bird! And Burley got in a rage, and said he'd leave every farthing to the
      sailor. Says Mel: "I'm a poor tradesman; but I have and I always will have
      the feelings of a gentleman, and they're more to me than hard cash, and
      the honour of my daughter, sir, is dearer to me than my blood. Out of the
      house!" cries Mel. And away old Burley went, and left every penny to the
      sailor, Admiral Harrington, who never noticed 'em an inch. Now, there!'
    
    
      All had listened to Mr. George attentively, and he had slurred the
      apologetic passages, and emphasized the propitiatory 'before ladies' in a
      way to make himself well understood a generation back.
    
    
      'Bravo, old Mel!' rang the voice of Lady Jocelyn, and a murmur ensued, in
      the midst of which Rose stood up and hurried round the table to Mrs.
      Strike, who was seen to rise from her chair; and as she did so, the
      ill-arranged locks fell from their unnatural restraint down over her
      shoulders; one great curl half forward to the bosom, and one behind her
      right ear. Her eyes were wide, her whole face, neck, and fingers, white as
      marble. The faintest tremor of a frown on her brows, and her shut lips,
      marked the continuation of some internal struggle, as if with her last
      conscious force she kept down a flood of tears and a wild outcry which it
      was death to hold. Sir Franks felt his arm touched, and looked up, and
      caught her, as Rose approached. The Duke and other gentlemen went to his
      aid, and as the beautiful woman was borne out white and still as a corpse,
      the Countess had this dagger plunged in her heart from the mouth of Mr.
      George, addressing Miss Carrington:
    
    
      'I swear I didn't do it on purpose. She 's Carry Harrington, old Mel's
      daughter, as sure as she 's flesh and blood!'
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XXIII. TREATS OF A HANDKERCHIEF
    
    
      Running through Beckley Park, clear from the chalk, a little stream gave
      light and freshness to its pasturage. Near where it entered, a
      bathing-house of white marble had been built, under which the water
      flowed, and the dive could be taken to a paved depth, and you swam out
      over a pebbly bottom into sun-light, screened by the thick-weeded banks,
      loose-strife and willow-herb, and mint, nodding over you, and in the later
      season long-plumed yellow grasses. Here at sunrise the young men washed
      their limbs, and here since her return home English Rose loved to walk by
      night. She had often spoken of the little happy stream to Evan in
      Portugal, and when he came to Beckley Court, she arranged that he should
      sleep in a bed-room overlooking it. The view was sweet and pleasant to
      him, for all the babbling of the water was of Rose, and winding in and
      out, to East, to North, it wound to embowered hopes in the lover's mind,
      to tender dreams; and often at dawn, when dressing, his restless heart
      embarked on it, and sailed into havens, the phantom joys of which coloured
      his life for him all the day. But most he loved to look across it when the
      light fell. The palest solitary gleam along its course spoke to him rich
      promise. The faint blue beam of a star chained all his longings, charmed
      his sorrows to sleep. Rose like a fairy had breathed her spirit here, and
      it was a delight to the silly luxurious youth to lie down, and fix some
      image of a flower bending to the stream on his brain, and in the cradle of
      fancies that grew round it, slide down the tide of sleep.
    
    
      From the image of a flower bending to the stream, like his own soul to the
      bosom of Rose, Evan built sweet fables. It was she that exalted him, that
      led him through glittering chapters of adventure. In his dream of deeds
      achieved for her sake, you may be sure the young man behaved worthily,
      though he was modest when she praised him, and his limbs trembled when the
      land whispered of his great reward to come. The longer he stayed at
      Beckley the more he lived in this world within world, and if now and then
      the harsh outer life smote him, a look or a word from Rose encompassed him
      again, and he became sensible only of a distant pain.
    
    
      At first his hope sprang wildly to possess her, to believe, that after he
      had done deeds that would have sent ordinary men in the condition of
      shattered hulks to the hospital, she might be his. Then blow upon blow was
      struck, and he prayed to be near her till he died: no more. Then she,
      herself, struck him to the ground, and sitting in his chamber, sick and
      weary, on the evening of his mishap, Evan's sole desire was to obtain the
      handkerchief he had risked his neck for. To have that, and hold it to his
      heart, and feel it as a part of her, seemed much.
    
    
      Over a length of the stream the red round harvest-moon was rising, and the
      weakened youth was this evening at the mercy of the charm that encircled
      him. The water curved, and dimpled, and flowed flat, and the whole body of
      it rushed into the spaces of sad splendour. The clustered trees stood like
      temples of darkness; their shadows lengthened supernaturally; and a pale
      gloom crept between them on the sward. He had been thinking for some time
      that Rose would knock at his door, and give him her voice, at least; but
      she did not come; and when he had gazed out on the stream till his eyes
      ached, he felt that he must go and walk by it. Those little flashes of the
      hurrying tide spoke to him of a secret rapture and of a joy-seeking
      impulse; the pouring onward of all the blood of life to one illumined
      heart, mournful from excess of love.
    
    
      Pardon me, I beg. Enamoured young men have these notions. Ordinarily Evan
      had sufficient common sense and was as prosaic as mankind could wish him;
      but he has had a terrible fall in the morning, and a young woman rages in
      his brain. Better, indeed, and 'more manly,' were he to strike and raise
      huge bosses on his forehead, groan, and so have done with it. We must let
      him go his own way.
    
    
      At the door he was met by the Countess. She came into the room without a
      word or a kiss, and when she did speak, the total absence of any euphuism
      gave token of repressed excitement yet more than her angry eyes and eager
      step. Evan had grown accustomed to her moods, and if one moment she was
      the halcyon, and another the petrel, it no longer disturbed him, seeing
      that he was a stranger to the influences by which she was affected. The
      Countess rated him severely for not seeking repose and inviting sympathy.
      She told him that the Jocelyns had one and all combined in an infamous
      plot to destroy the race of Harrington, and that Caroline had already
      succumbed to their assaults; that the Jocelyns would repent it, and sooner
      than they thought for; and that the only friend the Harringtons had in the
      house was Miss Bonner, whom Providence would liberally reward.
    
    
      Then the Countess changed to a dramatic posture, and whispered aloud,
      'Hush: she is here. She is so anxious. Be generous, my brother, and let
      her see you!'
    
    
      'She?' said Evan, faintly. 'May she come, Louisa?' He hoped for Rose.
    
    
      'I have consented to mask it,' returned the Countess. 'Oh, what do I not
      sacrifice for you!'
    
    
      She turned from him, and to Evan's chagrin introduced Juliana Bonner.
    
    
      'Five minutes, remember!' said the Countess. 'I must not hear of more.'
      And then Evan found himself alone with Miss Bonner, and very uneasy. This
      young lady had restless brilliant eyes, and a contraction about the
      forehead which gave one the idea of a creature suffering perpetual
      headache. She said nothing, and when their eyes met she dropped hers in a
      manner that made silence too expressive. Feeling which, Evan began:
    
    
      'May I tell you that I think it is I who ought to be nursing you, not you
      me?'
    
    
      Miss Bonner replied by lifting her eyes and dropping them as before,
      murmuring subsequently, 'Would you do so?'
    
    
      'Most certainly, if you did me the honour to select me.'
    
    
      The fingers of the young lady commenced twisting and intertwining on her
      lap. Suddenly she laughed:
    
    
      'It would not do at all. You won't be dismissed from your present service
      till you 're unfit for any other.'
    
    
      'What do you mean?' said Evan, thinking more of the unmusical laugh than
      of the words.
    
    
      He received no explanation, and the irksome silence caused him to look
      through the window, as an escape for his mind, at least. The waters
      streamed on endlessly into the golden arms awaiting them. The low moon
      burnt through the foliage. In the distance, over a reach of the flood, one
      tall aspen shook against the lighted sky.
    
    
      'Are you in pain?' Miss Bonner asked, and broke his reverie.
    
    
      'No; I am going away, and perhaps I sigh involuntarily.'
    
    
      'You like these grounds?'
    
    
      'I have never been so happy in any place.'
    
    
      'With those cruel young men about you?'
    
    
      Evan now laughed. 'We don't call young men cruel, Miss Bonner.'
    
    
      'But were they not? To take advantage of what Rose told them       it was
      base!'
    
    
      She had said more than she intended, possibly, for she coloured under his
      inquiring look, and added: 'I wish I could say the same as you of Beckley.
      Do you know, I am called Rose's thorn?'
    
    
      'Not by Miss Jocelyn herself, certainly!'
    
    
      'How eager you are to defend her. But am I not       tell me       do I
      not look like a thorn in company with her?'
    
    
      'There is but the difference that ill health would make.'
    
    
      'Ill health? Oh, yes! And Rose is so much better born.'
    
    
      'To that, I am sure, she does not give a thought.'
    
    
      'Not Rose? Oh!'
    
    
      An exclamation, properly lengthened, convinces the feelings more
      satisfactorily than much logic. Though Evan claimed only the hand-kerchief
      he had won, his heart sank at the sound. Miss Bonner watched him, and
      springing forward, said sharply:
    
    
      'May I tell you something?'
    
    
      'You may tell me what you please.'
    
    
      'Then, whether I offend you or not, you had better leave this.'
    
    
      'I am going,' said Evan. 'I am only waiting to introduce your tutor to
      you.'
    
    
      She kept her eyes on him, and in her voice as well there was a depth, as
      she returned:
    
    
      'Mr. Laxley, Mr. Forth, and Harry, are going to Lymport to-morrow.'
    
    
      Evan was looking at a figure, whose shadow was thrown towards the house
      from the margin of the stream.
    
    
      He stood up, and taking the hand of Miss Bonner, said:
    
    
      'I thank you. I may, perhaps, start with them. At any rate, you have done
      me a great service, which I shall not forget.'
    
    
      The figure by the stream he knew to be that of Rose. He released Miss
      Bonner's trembling moist hand, and as he continued standing, she moved to
      the door, after once following the line of his eyes into the moonlight.
    
    
      Outside the door a noise was audible. Andrew had come to sit with his dear
      boy, and the Countess had met and engaged and driven him to the other end
      of the passage, where he hung remonstrating with her.
    
    
      'Why, Van,' he said, as Evan came up to him, 'I thought you were in a
      profound sleep. Louisa said       '
    
    
      'Silly Andrew!' interposed the Countess, 'do you not observe he is
      sleep-walking now?' and she left them with a light laugh to go to Juliana,
      whom she found in tears. The Countess was quite aware of the efficacy of a
      little bit of burlesque lying to cover her retreat from any petty
      exposure.
    
    
      Evan soon got free from Andrew. He was under the dim stars, walking to the
      great fire in the East. The cool air refreshed him. He was simply going to
      ask for his own, before he went, and had no cause to fear what would be
      thought by any one. A handkerchief! A man might fairly win that, and carry
      it out of a very noble family, without having to blush for himself.
    
    
      I cannot say whether he inherited his feeling for rank from Mel, his
      father, or that the Countess had succeeded in instilling it, but Evan
      never took Republican ground in opposition to those who insulted him, and
      never lashed his 'manhood' to assert itself, nor compared the fineness of
      his instincts with the behaviour of titled gentlemen. Rather he seemed to
      admit the distinction between his birth and that of a gentleman, admitting
      it to his own soul, as it were, and struggled simply as men struggle
      against a destiny. The news Miss Bonner had given him sufficed to break a
      spell which could not have endured another week; and Andrew, besides, had
      told him of Caroline's illness. He walked to meet Rose, honestly intending
      to ask for his own, and wish her good-bye.
    
    
      Rose saw him approach, and knew him in the distance. She was sitting on a
      lower branch of the aspen, that shot out almost from the root, and
      stretched over the intervolving rays of light on the tremulous water. She
      could not move to meet him. She was not the Rose whom we have hitherto
      known. Love may spring in the bosom of a young girl, like Helper in the
      evening sky, a grey speck in a field of grey, and not be seen or known,
      till surely as the circle advances the faint planet gathers fire, and,
      coming nearer earth, dilates, and will and must be seen and known. When
      Evan lay like a dead man on the ground, Rose turned upon herself as the
      author of his death, and then she felt this presence within her, and her
      heart all day had talked to her of it, and was throbbing now, and would
      not be quieted. She could only lift her eyes and give him her hand; she
      could not speak. She thought him cold, and he was; cold enough to think
      that she and her cousin were not unlike in their manner, though not deep
      enough to reflect that it was from the same cause.
    
    
      She was the first to find her wits: but not before she spoke did she feel,
      and start to feel, how long had been the silence, and that her hand was
      still in his.
    
    
      'Why did you come out, Evan? It was not right.'
    
    
      'I came to speak to you. I shall leave early to-morrow, and may not see
      you alone.'
    
    
      'You are going              ?'
    
    
      She checked her voice, and left the thrill of it wavering in him.
    
    
      'Yes, Rose, I am going; I should have gone before.'
    
    
      'Evan!' she grasped his hand, and then timidly retained it. 'You have not
      forgiven me? I see now. I did not think of any risk to you. I only wanted
      you to beat. I wanted you to be first and best. If you knew how I thank
      God for saving you! What my punishment would have been!'
    
    
      Till her eyes were full she kept them on him, too deep in emotion to be
      conscious of it.
    
    
      He could gaze on her tears coldly.
    
    
      'I should be happy to take the leap any day for the prize you offered. I
      have come for that.'
    
    
      'For what, Evan?' But while she was speaking the colour mounted in her
      cheeks, and she went on rapidly:
    
    
      'Did you think it unkind of me not to come to nurse you. I must tell you,
      to defend myself. It was the Countess, Evan. She is offended with me       very
      justly, I dare say. She would not let me come. What could I do? I had no
      claim to come.'
    
    
      Rose was not aware of the import of her speech. Evan, though he felt more
      in it, and had some secret nerves set tingling and dancing, was not to be
      moved from his demand.
    
    
      'Do you intend to withhold it, Rose?'
    
    
      'Withhold what, Evan? Anything that you wish for is yours.'
    
    
      'The handkerchief. Is not that mine?'
    
    
      Rose faltered a word. Why did he ask for it? Because he asked for nothing
      else, and wanted no other thing save that.
    
    
      Why did she hesitate? Because it was so poor a gift, and so unworthy of
      him.
    
    
      And why did he insist? Because in honour she was bound to surrender it.
    
    
      And why did she hesitate still? Let her answer.
    
    
      'Oh, Evan! I would give you anything but that; and if you are going away,
      I should beg so much to keep it.'
    
    
      He must have been in a singular state not to see her heart in the refusal,
      as was she not to see his in the request. But Love is blindest just when
      the bandage is being removed from his forehead.
    
    
      'Then you will not give it me, Rose? Do you think I shall go about
      boasting "This is Miss Jocelyn's handkerchief, and I, poor as I am, have
      won it"?'
    
    
      The taunt struck aslant in Rose's breast with a peculiar sting. She stood
      up.
    
    
      'I will give it you, Evan.'
    
    
      Turning from him she drew it forth, and handed it to him hurriedly. It was
      warm. It was stained with his blood. He guessed where it had been
      nestling, and, now, as if by revelation, he saw that large sole star in
      the bosom of his darling, and was blinded by it and lost his senses.
    
    
      'Rose! beloved!'
    
    
      Like the flower of his nightly phantasy bending over the stream, he looked
      and saw in her sweet face the living wonders that encircled his image; she
      murmuring: 'No, you must hate me.'
    
    
      'I love you, Rose, and dare to say it       and it 's unpardonable. Can
      you forgive me?'
    
    
      She raised her face to him.
    
    
      'Forgive you for loving me?' she said.
    
    
      Holy to them grew the stillness: the ripple suffused in golden moonlight:
      the dark edges of the leaves against superlative brightness. Not a chirp
      was heard, nor anything save the cool and endless carol of the happy
      waters, whose voices are the spirits of silence. Nature seemed consenting
      that their hands should be joined, their eyes intermingling. And when
      Evan, with a lover's craving, wished her lips to say what her eyes said so
      well, Rose drew his fingers up, and, with an arch smile and a blush,
      kissed them. The simple act set his heart thumping, and from the look of
      love, she saw an expression of pain pass through him. Her fealty       her
      guileless, fearless truth       which the kissing of his hand brought
      vividly before him, conjured its contrast as well in this that was hidden
      from her, or but half suspected. Did she know       know and love him
      still? He thought it might be: but that fell dead on her asking:
    
    
      'Shall I speak to Mama to-night?'
    
    
      A load of lead crushed him.
    
    
      'Rose!' he said; but could get no farther.
    
    
      Innocently, or with well-masked design, Rose branched off into little
      sweet words about his bruised shoulder, touching it softly, as if she knew
      the virtue that was in her touch, and accusing her selfish self as she
      caressed it:
    
    
      'Dearest Evan! you must have been sure I thought no one like you. Why did
      you not tell me before? I can hardly believe it now! Do you know,' she
      hurried on, 'they think me cold and heartless,       am I? I must be, to
      have made you run such risk; but yet I'm sure I could not have survived
      you.'
    
    
      Dropping her voice, Rose quoted Ruth. As Evan listened, the words were
      like food from heaven poured into his spirit.
    
    
      'To-morrow,' he kept saying to himself, 'to-morrow I will tell her all.
      Let her think well of me a few short hours.'
    
    
      But the passing minutes locked them closer; each had a new link       in a
      word, or a speechless breath, or a touch: and to break the marriage of
      their eyes there must be infinite baseness on one side, or on the other
      disloyalty to love.
    
    
      The moon was a silver ball, high up through the aspen-leaves. Evan kissed
      the hand of Rose, and led her back to the house. He had appeased his
      conscience by restraining his wild desire to kiss her lips.
    
    
      In the hall they parted. Rose whispered, 'Till death!' giving him her
      hands.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XXIV. THE COUNTESS MAKES HERSELF FELT
    
    
      There is a peculiar reptile whose stroke is said to deprive men of motion.
      On the day after the great Mel had stalked the dinner-table of Beckley
      Court, several of the guests were sensible of the effect of this
      creature's mysterious touch, without knowing what it was that paralyzed
      them. Drummond Forth had fully planned to go to Lymport. He had special
      reasons for making investigations with regard to the great Mel. Harry, who
      was fond of Drummond, offered to accompany him, and Laxley, for the sake
      of a diversion, fell into the scheme. Mr. George Uplift was also to be of
      the party, and promised them fun. But when the time came to start, not one
      could be induced to move: Laxley was pressingly engaged by Rose: Harry
      showed the rope the Countess held him by; Mr. George made a singular face,
      and seriously advised Drummond to give up the project.
    
    
      'Don't rub that woman the wrong way,' he said, in a private colloquy they
      had. 'By Jingo, she's a Tartar. She was as a gal, and she isn't changed,
      Lou Harrington. Fancy now: she knew me, and she faced me out, and made me
      think her a stranger! Gad, I'm glad I didn't speak to the others. Lord's
      sake, keep it quiet. Don't rouse that woman, now, if you want to keep a
      whole skin.'
    
    
      Drummond laughed at his extreme earnestness in cautioning him, and
      appeared to enjoy his dread of the Countess. Mr. George would not tell how
      he had been induced to change his mind. He repeated his advice with a very
      emphatic shrug of the shoulder.
    
    
      'You seem afraid of her,' said Drummond.
    
    
      'I am. I ain't ashamed to confess it. She's a regular viper, my boy!' said
      Mr. George. 'She and I once were pretty thick       least said soonest
      mended, you know. I offended her. Wasn't quite up to her mark       a
      tailor's daughter, you know. Gad, if she didn't set an Irish Dragoon
      Captain on me!       I went about in danger of my life. The fellow began
      to twist his damned black moustaches the moment he clapped eyes on me       bullied
      me till, upon my soul, I was almost ready to fight him! Oh, she was a
      little tripping Tartar of a bantam hen then. She's grown since she's been
      countessed, and does it peacocky. Now, I give you fair warning, you know.
      She's more than any man's match.'
    
    
      'I dare say I shall think the same when she has beaten me,' quoth cynical
      Drummond, and immediately went and gave orders for his horse to be
      saddled, thinking that he would tread on the head of the viper.
    
    
      But shortly before the hour of his departure, Mrs. Evremonde summoned him
      to her, and showed him a slip of paper, on which was written, in an
      uncouth small hand:
    
    
      'Madam: a friend warns you that your husband is coming here. Deep interest
      in your welfare is the cause of an anonymous communication. The writer
      wishes only to warn you in time.'
    
    
      Mrs. Evremonde told Drummond that she had received it from one of the
      servants when leaving the breakfast-room. Beyond the fact that a man on
      horseback had handed it to a little boy, who had delivered it over to the
      footman, Drummond could learn nothing. Of course, all thought of the
      journey to Lymport was abandoned. If but to excogitate a motive for the
      origin of the document, Drummond was forced to remain; and now he had it,
      and now he lost it again; and as he was wandering about in his maze, the
      Countess met him with a 'Good morning, Mr., Forth. Have I impeded your
      expedition by taking my friend Mr. Harry to cavalier me to-day?'
    
    
      Drummond smilingly assured her that she had not in any way disarranged his
      projects, and passed with so absorbed a brow that the Countess could
      afford to turn her head and inspect him, without fear that he would
      surprise her in the act. Knocking the pearly edge of her fan on her teeth,
      she eyed him under her joined black lashes, and deliberately read his
      thoughts in the mere shape of his back and shoulders. She read him through
      and through, and was unconscious of the effective attitude she stood in
      for the space of two full minutes, and even then it required one of our
      unhappy sex to recall her. This was Harry Jocelyn.
    
    
      'My friend,' she said to him, with a melancholy smile, 'my one friend
      here!'
    
    
      Harry went through the form of kissing her hand, which he had been taught,
      and practised cunningly as the first step of the ladder.
    
    
      'I say, you looked so handsome, standing as you did just now,' he
      remarked; and she could see how far beneath her that effective attitude
      had precipitated the youth.
    
    
      'Ah!' she sighed, walking on, with the step of majesty in exile.
    
    
      'What the deuce is the matter with everybody to-day?' cried Harry. 'I 'm
      hanged if I can make it out. There's the Carrington, as you call her, I
      met her with such a pair of eyes, and old George looking as if he'd been
      licked, at her heels; and there's Drummond and his lady fair moping about
      the lawn, and my mother positively getting excited       there's a
      miracle! and Juley 's sharpening her nails for somebody, and if Ferdinand
      don't look out, your brother 'll be walking off with Rosey       that 's
      my opinion.'
    
    
      'Indeed,' said the Countess. 'You really think so?'
    
    
      'Well, they come it pretty strong together.'
    
    
      'And what constitutes the "come it strong," Mr. Harry?'
    
    
      'Hold of hands; you know,' the young gentleman indicated.
    
    
      'Alas, then! must not we be more discreet?'
    
    
      'Oh! but it's different. With young people one knows what that means.'
    
    
      'Deus!' exclaimed the Countess, tossing her head weariedly, and Harry
      perceived his slip, and down he went again.
    
    
      What wonder that a youth in such training should consent to fetch and
      carry, to listen and relate, to play the spy and know no more of his
      office than that it gave him astonishing thrills of satisfaction, and now
      and then a secret sweet reward?
    
    
      The Countess had sealed Miss Carrington's mouth by one of her most
      dexterous strokes. On leaving the dinner-table over-night, and seeing that
      Caroline's attack would preclude their instant retreat, the gallant
      Countess turned at bay. A word aside to Mr. George Uplift, and then the
      Countess took a chair by Miss Carrington. She did all the conversation,
      and supplied all the smiles to it, and when a lady has to do that she is
      justified in striking, and striking hard, for to abandon the pretence of
      sweetness is a gross insult from one woman to another.
    
    
      The Countess then led circuitously, but with all the ease in the world, to
      the story of a Portuguese lady, of a marvellous beauty, and who was deeply
      enamoured of the Chevalier Miguel de Rasadio, and engaged to be married to
      him: but, alas for her! in the insolence of her happiness she wantonly
      made an enemy in the person of a most unoffending lady, and she repented
      it. While sketching the admirable Chevalier, the Countess drew a telling
      portrait of Mr. George Uplift, and gratified her humour and her wrath at
      once by strong truth to nature in the description and animated encomiums
      on the individual. The Portuguese lady, too, a little resembled Miss
      Carrington, in spite of her marvellous beauty. And it was odd that Miss
      Carrington should give a sudden start and a horrified glance at the
      Countess just when the Countess was pathetically relating the proceeding
      taken by the revengeful lady on the beautiful betrothed of the Chevalier
      Miguel de Rasadio: which proceeding was nothing other than to bring to the
      Chevalier's knowledge that his beauty had a defect concealed by her
      apparel, and that the specks in his fruit were not one, or two, but, Oh!
      And the dreadful sequel to the story the Countess could not tell:
      preferring ingeniously to throw a tragic veil over it. Miss Carrington
      went early to bed that night.
    
    
      The courage that mounteth with occasion was eminently the attribute of the
      Countess de Saldar. After that dreadful dinner she (since the weaknesses
      of great generals should not be altogether ignored), did pray for flight
      and total obscurity, but Caroline could not be left in her hysteric state,
      and now that she really perceived that Evan was progressing and on the
      point of sealing his chance, the devoted lady resolved to hold her ground.
      Besides, there was the pic-nic. The Countess had one dress she had not yet
      appeared in, and it was for the picnic she kept it. That small motives are
      at the bottom of many illustrious actions is a modern discovery; but I
      shall not adopt the modern principle of magnifying the small motive till
      it overshadows my noble heroine. I remember that the small motive is only
      to be seen by being borne into the range of my vision by a powerful
      microscope; and if I do more than see       if I carry on my reflections
      by the aid of the glass, I arrive at conclusions that must be false. Men
      who dwarf human nature do this. The gods are juster. The Countess, though
      she wished to remain for the pic-nic, and felt warm in anticipation of the
      homage to her new dress, was still a gallant general and a devoted sister,
      and if she said to herself, 'Come what may, I will stay for that pic-nic,
      and they shall not brow-beat me out of it,' it is that trifling pleasures
      are noisiest about the heart of human nature: not that they govern us
      absolutely. There is mob-rule in minds as in communities, but the Countess
      had her appetites in excellent drill. This pic-nic surrendered,
      represented to her defeat in all its ignominy. The largest longest-headed
      of schemes ask occasionally for something substantial and immediate. So
      the Countess stipulated with Providence for the pic-nic. It was a point to
      be passed: 'Thorough flood, thorough fire.'
    
    
      In vain poor Andrew Cogglesby, to whom the dinner had been torture, and
      who was beginning to see the position they stood in at Beckley, begged to
      be allowed to take them away, or to go alone. The Countess laughed him
      into submission. As a consequence of her audacious spirits she grew more
      charming and more natural, and the humour that she possessed, but which,
      like her other faculties, was usually subordinate to her plans, gave
      spontaneous bursts throughout the day, and delighted her courtiers. Nor
      did the men at all dislike the difference of her manner with them, and
      with the ladies. I may observe that a woman who shows a marked depression
      in the presence of her own sex will be thought very superior by ours; that
      is, supposing she is clever and agreeable. Manhood distinguishes what
      flatters it. A lady approaches. 'We must be proper,' says the Countess,
      and her hearty laugh dies with suddenness and is succeeded by the maturest
      gravity. And the Countess can look a profound merriment with perfect
      sedateness when there appears to be an equivoque in company. Finely secret
      are her glances, as if under every eye-lash there lurked the shade of a
      meaning. What she meant was not so clear. All this was going on, and Lady
      Jocelyn was simply amused, and sat as at a play.
    
    
      'She seems to have stepped out of a book of French memoirs,' said her
      ladyship. 'La vie galante et devote       voila la Comtesse.'
    
    
      In contradistinction to the other ladies, she did not detest the Countess
      because she could not like her.
    
    
      'Where 's the harm in her?' she asked. 'She doesn't damage the men, that I
      can see. And a person you can laugh at and with, is inexhaustible.'
    
    
      'And how long is she to stay here?' Mrs. Shorne inquired. Mrs. Melville
      remarking: 'Her visit appears to be inexhaustible.'
    
    
      'I suppose she'll stay till the Election business is over,' said Lady
      Jocelyn.
    
    
      The Countess had just driven with Melville to Fallow field in Caroline's
      black lace shawl.
    
    
      'Upwards of four weeks longer!' Mrs. Melville interjected.
    
    
      Lady Jocelyn chuckled.
    
    
      Miss Carrington was present. She had been formerly sharp in her
      condemnation of the Countess       her affectedness, her euphuism, and her
      vulgarity. Now she did not say a word, though she might have done it with
      impunity.
    
    
      'I suppose, Emily, you see what Rose is about?' said Mrs. Melville. 'I
      should not have thought it adviseable to have that young man here, myself.
      I think I let you know that.'
    
    
      'One young man's as good as another,' responded her ladyship. 'I 've my
      doubts of the one that's much better. I fancy Rose is as good a judge by
      this time as you or I.'
    
    
      Mrs. Melville made an effort or two to open Lady Jocelyn's eyes, and then
      relapsed into the confident serenity inspired by evil prognostications.
    
    
      'But there really does seem some infatuation about these people!'
      exclaimed Mrs. Shorne, turning to Miss Current. 'Can you understand it?
      The Duke, my dear! Things seem to be going on in the house, that really       and
      so openly.'
    
    
      'That's one virtue,' said Miss Current, with her imperturbable metallic
      voice, and face like a cold clear northern sky. 'Things done in secret
      throw on the outsiders the onus of raising a scandal.'
    
    
      'You don't believe, then?' suggested Mrs. Shorne.
    
    
      Miss Current replied: 'I always wait for a thing to happen first.'
    
    
      'But haven't you seen, my dear?'
    
    
      'I never see anything, my dear.'
    
    
      'Then you must be blind, my dear.'
    
    
      'On the contrary, that 's how I keep my sight, my dear.'
    
    
      'I don't understand you,' said Mrs. Shorne.
    
    
      'It's a part of the science of optics, and requires study,' said Miss
      Current.
    
    
      Neither with the worldly nor the unworldly woman could the ladies do
      anything. But they were soon to have their triumph.
    
    
      A delicious morning had followed the lovely night. The stream flowed under
      Evan's eyes, like something in a lower sphere, now. His passion took him
      up, as if a genie had lifted him into mid-air, and showed him the world on
      a palm of a hand; and yet, as he dressed by the window, little chinks in
      the garden wall, and nectarines under their shiny leaves, and the white
      walks of the garden, were stamped on his hot brain accurately and
      lastingly. Ruth upon the lips of Rose: that voice of living constancy made
      music to him everywhere. 'Thy God shall be my God.' He had heard it all
      through the night. He had not yet broken the tender charm sufficiently to
      think that he must tell her the sacrifice she would have to make. When
      partly he did, the first excuse he clutched at was, that he had not even
      kissed her on the forehead. Surely he had been splendidly chivalrous? Just
      as surely he would have brought on himself the scorn of the chivalrous or
      of the commonly balanced if he had been otherwise. The grandeur of this or
      of any of his proceedings, then, was forfeited, as it must needs be when
      we are in the false position: we can have no glory though martyred. The
      youth felt it, even to the seeing of why it was; and he resolved, in
      justice to the dear girl, that he would break loose from his fetters, as
      we call our weakness. Behold, Rose met him descending the stairs, and,
      taking his hand, sang, unabashed, by the tell-tale colour coming over her
      face, a stave of a little Portuguese air that they had both been fond of
      in Portugal; and he, listening to it, and looking in her eyes, saw that
      his feelings in       the old time had been hers. Instantly the old time
      gave him its breath, the present drew back.
    
    
      Rose, now that she had given her heart out, had no idea of concealment.
      She would have denied nothing to her aunts: she was ready to confide it to
      her mother. Was she not proud of the man she loved? When Evan's hand
      touched hers she retained it, and smiled up at him frankly, as it were to
      make him glad in her gladness. If before others his eyes brought the blood
      to her cheeks, she would perhaps drop her eye-lids an instant, and then
      glance quickly level again to reassure him. And who would have thought
      that this boisterous, boyish creature had such depths of eye! Cold, did
      they call her? Let others think her cold. The tender knowledge of her       the
      throbbing secret they held in common sang at his heart. Rose made no
      confidante, but she attempted no mystery. Evan should have risen to the
      height of the noble girl. But the dearer and sweeter her bearing became,
      the more conscious he was of the dead weight he was dragging: in truth her
      behaviour stamped his false position to hard print the more he admired her
      for it, and he had shrinkings from the feminine part it imposed on him to
      play.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XXV. IN WHICH THE STREAM FLOWS MUDDY AND CLEAR
    
    
      An Irish retriever-pup of the Shannon breed, Pat by name, was undergoing
      tuition on the sward close by the kennels, Rose's hunting-whip being
      passed through his collar to restrain erratic propensities. The particular
      point of instruction which now made poor Pat hang out his tongue, and
      agitate his crisp brown curls, was the performance of the 'down-charge'; a
      ceremony demanding implicit obedience from the animal in the midst of
      volatile gambadoes, and a simulation of profound repose when his desire to
      be up and bounding was mighty. Pat's Irish eyes were watching Rose, as he
      lay with his head couched between his forepaws in the required attitude.
      He had but half learnt his lesson; and something in his half-humorous,
      half-melancholy look talked to Rose more eloquently than her friend
      Ferdinand at her elbow. Laxley was her assistant dog-breaker. Rose would
      not abandon her friends because she had accepted a lover. On the contrary,
      Rose was very kind to Ferdinand, and perhaps felt bound to be so to-day.
      To-day, also, her face was lighted; a readiness to colour, and an
      expression of deeper knowledge, which she now had, made the girl dangerous
      to friends. This was not Rose's fault but there is no doubt among the
      faculty that love is a contagious disease, and we ought not to come within
      miles of the creatures in whom it lodges.
    
    
      Pat's tail kept hinting to his mistress that a change would afford him
      satisfaction. After a time she withdrew her wistful gaze from him, and
      listened entirely to Ferdinand: and it struck her that he spoke
      particularly well to-day, though she did not see so much in his eyes as in
      Pat's. The subject concerned his departure, and he asked Rose if she
      should be sorry. Rose, to make him sure of it, threw a music into her
      voice dangerous to friends. For she had given heart and soul to Evan, and
      had a sense, therefore, of being irredeemably in debt to her old
      associates, and wished to be doubly kind to them.
    
    
      Pat took advantage of the diversion to stand up quietly and have a shake.
      He then began to kiss his mistress's hand, to show that all was right on
      both sides; and followed this with a playful pretence at a bite, that
      there might be no subsequent misunderstanding, and then a bark and a
      whine. As no attention was paid to this amount of plain-speaking, Pat made
      a bolt. He got no farther than the length of the whip, and all he gained
      was to bring on himself the terrible word of drill once more. But Pat had
      tasted liberty. Irish rebellion against constituted authority was
      exhibited. Pat would not: his ears tossed over his head, and he jumped to
      right and left, and looked the raggedest rapparee that ever his ancestry
      trotted after. Rose laughed at his fruitless efforts to get free; but
      Ferdinand meditatively appeared to catch a sentiment in them.
    
    
      'Down-charge, Sir, will you? Ah, Pat! Pat! You'll have to obey me, my boy.
      Now, down-charge!'
    
    
      While Rose addressed the language of reason to Pat, Ferdinand slipped in a
      soft word or two. Presently she saw him on one knee.
    
    
      'Pat won't, and I will,' said he.
    
    
      'But Pat shall, and you had better not,' said she. 'Besides, my dear
      Ferdinand,' she added, laughing, 'you don't know how to do it.'
    
    
      'Do you want me to prostrate on all fours, Rose?'
    
    
      'No. I hope not. Do get up, Ferdinand. You'll be seen from the windows.'
    
    
      Instead of quitting his posture, he caught her hand, and scared her with a
      declaration.
    
    
      'Of all men, you to be on your knees! and to me, Ferdinand!' she cried, in
      discomfort.
    
    
      'Why shouldn't I, Rose?' was this youth's answer.
    
    
      He had got the idea that foreign cavalier manners would take with her; but
      it was not so easy to make his speech correspond with his posture, and he
      lost his opportunity, which was pretty. However, he spoke plain English.
      The interview ended by Rose releasing Pat from drill, and running off in a
      hurry. Where was Evan? She must have his consent to speak to her mother,
      and prevent a recurrence of these silly scenes.
    
    
      Evan was with Caroline, his sister.
    
    
      It was contrary to the double injunction of the Countess that Caroline
      should receive Evan during her absence, or that he should disturb the dear
      invalid with a visit. These two were not unlike both in organization and
      character, and they had not sat together long before they found each other
      out. Now, to further Evan's love-suit, the Countess had induced Caroline
      to continue yet awhile in the Purgatory Beckley Court had become to her;
      but Evan, in speaking of Rose, expressed a determination to leave her, and
      Caroline caught at it.
    
    
      'Can you?       will you? Oh, dear Van! have you the courage? I       look
      at me       you know the home I go to, and       and I think of it here as
      a place to be happy in. What have our marriages done for us? Better that
      we had married simple stupid men who earn their bread, and would not have
      been ashamed of us! And, my dearest, it is not only that. None can tell
      what our temptations are. Louisa has strength, but I feel I have none; and
      though, dear, for your true interest, I would indeed sacrifice myself       I
      would, Van! I would!       it is not good for you to stay,       I know it
      is not. For you have Papa's sense of honour       and oh! if you should
      learn to despise me, my dear brother!'
    
    
      She kissed him; her nerves were agitated by strong mental excitement. He
      attributed it to her recent attack of illness, but could not help asking,
      while he caressed her:
    
    
      'What's that? Despise you?'
    
    
      It may have been that Caroline felt then, that to speak of something was
      to forfeit something. A light glimmered across the dewy blue of her
      beautiful eyes. Desire to breathe it to him, and have his loving aid: the
      fear of forfeiting it, evil as it was to her, and at the bottom of all,
      that doubt we choose to encourage of the harm in a pleasant sin
      unaccomplished; these might be read in the rich dim gleam that swept like
      sunlight over sea-water between breaks of clouds.
    
    
      'Dear Van! do you love her so much?'
    
    
      Caroline knew too well that she was shutting her own theme with iron
      clasps when she once touched on Evan's.
    
    
      Love her? Love Rose? It became an endless carol with Evan. Caroline sighed
      for him from her heart.
    
    
      'You know       you understand me; don't you?' he said, after a breathless
      excursion of his fancy.
    
    
      'I believe you love her, dear. I think I have never loved any one but my
      one brother.'
    
    
      His love for Rose he could pour out to Caroline; when it came to Rose's
      love for him his blood thickened, and his tongue felt guilty. He must
      speak to her, he said,       tell her all.
    
    
      'Yes, tell her all,' echoed Caroline. 'Do, do tell her. Trust a woman
      utterly if she loves you, dear. Go to her instantly.'
    
    
      'Could you bear it?' said Evan. He began to think it was for the sake of
      his sisters that he had hesitated.
    
    
      'Bear it? bear anything rather than perpetual imposture. What have I not
      borne? Tell her, and then, if she is cold to you, let us go. Let us go. I
      shall be glad to. Ah, Van! I love you so.' Caroline's voice deepened. 'I
      love you so, my dear. You won't let your new love drive me out? Shall you
      always love me?'
    
    
      Of that she might be sure, whatever happened.
    
    
      'Should you love me, Van, if evil befel me?'
    
    
      Thrice as well, he swore to her.
    
    
      'But if I       if I, Van Oh! my life is intolerable! Supposing I should
      ever disgrace you in any way, and not turn out all you fancied me. I am
      very weak and unhappy.'
    
    
      Evan kissed her confidently, with a warm smile. He said a few words of the
      great faith he had in her: words that were bitter comfort to Caroline.
      This brother, who might save her, to him she dared not speak. Did she wish
      to be saved? She only knew that to wound Evan's sense of honour and the
      high and chivalrous veneration for her sex and pride in himself and those
      of his blood, would be wicked and unpardonable, and that no earthly
      pleasure could drown it. Thinking this, with her hands joined in pale
      dejection, Caroline sat silent, and Evan left her to lay bare his heart to
      Rose. On his way to find Rose he was stopped by the announcement of the
      arrival of Mr. Raikes, who thrust a bundle of notes into his hand, and
      after speaking loudly of 'his curricle,' retired on important business, as
      he said, with a mysterious air. 'I 'm beaten in many things, but not in
      the article Luck,' he remarked; 'you will hear of me, though hardly as a
      tutor in this academy.'
    
    
      Scanning the bundle of notes, without a reflection beyond the thought that
      money was in his hand; and wondering at the apparition of the curricle,
      Evan was joined by Harry Jocelyn, and Harry linked his arm in Evan's and
      plunged with extraordinary spontaneity and candour into the state of his
      money affairs. What the deuce he was to do for money he did not know. From
      the impressive manner in which he put it, it appeared to be one of
      Nature's great problems that the whole human race were bound to set their
      heads together to solve. A hundred pounds       Harry wanted no more, and
      he could not get it. His uncles? they were as poor as rats; and all the
      spare money they could club was going for Mel's Election expenses. A
      hundred and fifty was what Harry really wanted; but he could do with a
      hundred. Ferdinand, who had plenty, would not even lend him fifty.
      Ferdinand had dared to hint at a debt already unsettled, and he called
      himself a gentleman!
    
    
      'You wouldn't speak of money-matters now, would you, Harrington?'
    
    
      'I dislike the subject, I confess,' said Evan.
    
    
      'And so do I' Harry jumped at the perfect similarity between them. 'You
      can't think how it bothers one to have to talk about it. You and I are
      tremendously alike.'
    
    
      Evan might naturally suppose that a subject Harry detested, he would not
      continue, but for a whole hour Harry turned it over and over with grim
      glances at Jewry.
    
    
      'You see,' he wound up, 'I'm in a fix. I want to help that poor girl, and
      one or two things       '
    
    
      'It 's for that you want it?' cried Evan, brightening to him. 'Accept it
      from me.'
    
    
      It is a thing familiar to the experience of money-borrowers, that your
      'last chance' is the man who is to accommodate you; but we are always
      astonished, nevertheless; and Harry was, when notes to the amount of the
      largest sum named by him were placed in his hand by one whom he looked
      upon as the last to lend.
    
    
      'What a trump you are, Harrington!' was all he could say; and then he was
      for hurrying Evan into the house, to find pen and paper, and write down a
      memorandum of the loan: but Evan insisted upon sparing him the trouble,
      though Harry, with the admirable scruples of an inveterate borrower,
      begged hard to be allowed to bind himself legally to repay the money.
    
    
      ''Pon my soul, Harrington, you make me remember I once doubted whether you
      were one of us       rather your own fault, you know!' said Harry. 'Bury
      that, won't you?'
    
    
      ''Till your doubts recur,' Evan observed; and Harry burst out, 'Gad, if
      you weren't such a melancholy beggar, you'd be the jolliest fellow I know!
      There, go after Rosey. Dashed if I don't think you're ahead of Ferdinand,
      long chalks. Your style does for girls. I like women.'
    
    
      With a chuckle and a wink, Harry swung-off. Evan had now to reflect that
      he had just thrown away part of the price of his bondage to Tailordom; the
      mention of Rose filled his mind. Where was she? Both were seeking one
      another. Rose was in the cypress walk. He saw the star-like figure up the
      length of it, between the swelling tall dark pillars, and was hurrying to
      her, resolute not to let one minute of deception blacken further the soul
      that loved so true a soul. She saw him, and stood smiling, when the
      Countess issued, shadow-like, from a side path, and declared that she must
      claim her brother for a few instants. Would her sweet Rose pardon her?
      Rose bowed coolly. The hearts of the lovers were chilled, not that they
      perceived any malice in the Countess, but their keen instincts felt an
      evil fate.
    
    
      The Countess had but to tell Evan that she had met the insolvent in
      apples, and recognized him under his change of fortune, and had no doubt
      that at least he would amuse the company. Then she asked her brother the
      superfluous question, whether he loved her, which Evan answered
      satisfactorily enough, as he thought; but practical ladies require proofs.
    
    
      'Quick,' said Evan, seeing Rose vanish, 'what do you want? I'll do
      anything.'
    
    
      'Anything? Ah, but this will be disagreeable to you.'
    
    
      'Name it at once. I promise beforehand.'
    
    
      The Countess wanted Evan to ask Andrew to be the very best brother-in-law
      in the world, and win, unknown to himself, her cheerful thanks, by lending
      Evan to lend to her the sum of one hundred pounds, as she was in absolute
      distress for money.
    
    
      'Really, Louisa, this is a thing you might ask him yourself,' Evan
      remonstrated.
    
    
      'It would not become me to do so, dear,' said the Countess, demurely; and
      inasmuch as she had already drawn on Andrew in her own person pretty
      largely, her views of propriety were correct in this instance.
    
    
      Evan had to consent before he could be released. He ran to the end of the
      walk through the portal, into the park. Rose was not to be seen. She had
      gone in to dress for dinner. The opportunity might recur, but would his
      courage come with it? His courage had sunk on a sudden; or it may have
      been that it was worst for this young man to ask for a loan of money, than
      to tell his beloved that he was basely born, vile, and unworthy, and had
      snared her into loving him; for when he and Andrew were together, money
      was not alluded to. Andrew, however, betrayed remarkable discomposure. He
      said plainly that he wanted to leave Beckley Court, and wondered why he
      didn't leave, and whether he was on his head or his feet, and how he had
      been such a fool as to come.
    
    
      'Do you mean that for me?' said sensitive Evan.
    
    
      'Oh, you! You're a young buck,' returned Andrew, evasively. 'We
      common-place business men-we 're out of our element; and there's poor
      Carry can't sit down to their dinners without an upset. I thank God I'm a
      Radical, Van; one man's the same as another to me, how he's born, as long
      as he's honest and agreeable. But a chap like that George Uplift to look
      down on anybody! 'Gad, I've a good mind to bring in a Bill for the
      Abolition of the Squirearchy.'
    
    
      Ultimately, Andrew somehow contrived to stick a hint or two about the
      terrible dinner in Evan's quivering flesh. He did it as delicately as
      possible, half begging pardon, and perspiring profusely. Evan grasped his
      hand, and thanked him. Caroline's illness was now explained to him.
    
    
      'I'll take Caroline with me to-morrow,' he said. 'Louisa wishes to stay       there
      's a pic-nic. Will you look to her, and bring her with you?'
    
    
      'My dear Van,' replied Andrew, 'stop with Louisa? Now, in confidence, it's
      as bad as a couple of wives; no disrespect to my excellent good Harry at
      home; but Louisa       I don't know how it is       but Louisa, you lose
      your head, you're in a whirl, you're an automaton, a teetotum! I haven't a
      notion of what I've been doing or saying since I came here. My belief is,
      I 've been lying right and left. I shall be found out to a certainty: Oh!
      if she's made her mind up for the pic-nic, somebody must stop. I can only
      tell you, Van, it's one perpetual vapour-bath to me. There 'll be room for
      two in my trousers when I get back. I shall have to get the tailor to take
      them in a full half.'
    
    
      Here occurred an opening for one of those acrid pleasantries which console
      us when there is horrid warfare within.
    
    
      'You must give me the work,' said Evan, partly pleased with his hated self
      for being able to jest on the subject, as a piece of preliminary
      self-conquest.
    
    
      'Aha!' went Andrew, as if the joke were too good to be dwelt on; 'Hem';
      and by way of diverting from it cleverly and naturally, he remarked that
      the weather was fine. This made Evan allude to his letter written from
      Lymport, upon which Andrew said: 'tush! pish! humbug! nonsense! won't hear
      a word. Don't know anything about it. Van, you're going to be a brewer. I
      say you are. You're afraid you can't? I tell you, sir, I've got a bet on
      it. You're not going to make me lose, are you       eh? I have, and a
      stiff bet, too. You must and shall, so there's an end. Only we can't make
      arrangements just yet, my boy. Old Tom       very good old fellow       but,
      you know       must get old Tom out of the way, first. Now go and dress
      for dinner. And Lord preserve us from the Great Mel to-day!' Andrew
      mumbled as he turned away.
    
    
      Evan could not reach his chamber without being waylaid by the Countess.
      Had he remembered the sister who sacrificed so much for him? 'There,
      there!' cried Evan, and her hand closed on the delicious golden whispers
      of bank-notes. And, 'Oh, generous Andrew! dear good Evan!' were the
      exclamations of the gratified lady.
    
    
      There remained nearly another hundred. Evan laid out the notes, and eyed
      them while dressing. They seemed to say to him, 'We have you now.' He was
      clutched by a beneficent or a most malignant magician. The former seemed
      due to him, considering the cloud on his fortunes. This enigma might mean,
      that by submitting to a temporary humiliation, for a trial of him       in
      fact, by his acknowledgement of the fact, loathed though it was,       he
      won a secret overlooker's esteem, gained a powerful ally. Here was the
      proof, he held the proof. He had read Arabian Tales and could believe in
      marvels; especially could he believe in the friendliness of a magical
      thing that astounded without hurting him.
    
    
      He, sat down in his room at night and wrote a fairly manful letter to
      Rose; and it is to be said of the wretch he then saw himself, that he
      pardoned her for turning from so vile a pretender. He heard a step in the
      passage. It was Polly Wheedle. Polly had put her young mistress to bed,
      and was retiring to her own slumbers. He made her take the letter and
      promise to deliver it immediately. Would not to-morrow morning do, she
      asked, as Miss Rose was very sleepy. He seemed to hesitate       he was
      picturing how Rose looked when very sleepy. Why should he surrender this
      darling? And subtler question       why should he make her unhappy? Why
      disturb her at all in her sweet sleep?
    
    
      'Well,' said Evan. 'To-morrow will do.       No, take it to-night, for
      God's sake!' he cried, as one who bursts the spell of an opiate. 'Go at
      once.' The temptation had almost overcome him.
    
    
      Polly thought his proceedings queer. And what could the letter contain? A
      declaration, of course. She walked slowly along the passage, meditating on
      love, and remotely on its slave, Mr. Nicholas Frim. Nicholas had never
      written her a letter; but she was determined that he should, some day. She
      wondered what love-letters were like? Like valentines without the Cupids.
      Practical valentines, one might say. Not vapoury and wild, but hot and to
      the point. Delightful things! No harm in peeping at a love-letter, if you
      do it with the eye of a friend.
    
    
      Polly spelt just a word when a door opened at her elbow. She dropped her
      candle and curtsied to the Countess's voice. The Countess desired her to
      enter, and all in a tremble Polly crept in. Her air of guilt made the
      Countess thrill. She had merely called her in to extract daily gossip. The
      corner of the letter sticking up under Polly's neck attracted her
      strangely, and beginning with the familiar, 'Well, child,' she talked of
      things interesting to Polly, and then exhibited the pic-nic dress. It was
      a lovely half-mourning; airy sorrows, gauzy griefs, you might imagine to
      constitute the wearer. White delicately striped, exquisitely trimmed, and
      of a stuff to make the feminine mouth water!
    
    
      Could Polly refuse to try it on, when the flattering proposal met her
      ears? Blushing, shame-faced, adoring the lady who made her look adorable,
      Polly tried it on, and the Countess complimented her, and made a doll of
      her, and turned her this way and that way, and intoxicated her.
    
    
      'A rich husband, Polly, child! and you are a lady ready made.'
    
    
      Infamous poison to poor Polly; but as the thunder destroys small insects,
      exalted schemers are to be excused for riding down their few thousands.
      Moreover, the Countess really looked upon domestics as being only
      half-souls.
    
    
      Dressed in her own attire again, Polly felt in her pockets, and at her
      bosom, and sang out: 'Oh, my       Oh, where! Oh!'
    
    
      The letter was lost. The letter could not be found. The Countess grew
      extremely fatigued, and had to dismiss Polly, in spite of her eager
      petitions to be allowed to search under the carpets and inside the bed.
    
    
      In the morning came Evan's great trial. There stood Rose. She turned to
      him, and her eyes were happy and unclouded.
    
    
      'You are not changed?' he said.
    
    
      'Changed? what could change me?'
    
    
      The God of true hearts bless her! He could hardly believe it.
    
    
      'You are the Rose I knew yesterday?'
    
    
      'Yes, Evan. But you       you look as if you had not slept.'
    
    
      'You will not leave me this morning, before I go, Rose? Oh, my darling!
      this that you do for me is the work of an angel-nothing less! I have been
      a coward. And my beloved! to feel vile is agony to me       it makes me
      feel unworthy of the hand I press. Now all is clear between us. I go: I am
      forgiven.'
    
    
      Rose repeated his last words, and then added hurriedly:
    
    
      'All is clear between us? Shall I speak to Mama this morning? Dear Evan!
      it will be right that I should.'
    
    
      For the moment he could not understand why, but supposing a scrupulous
      honesty in her, said: 'Yes, tell Lady Jocelyn all.'
    
    
      'And then, Evan, you will never need to go.'
    
    
      They separated. The deep-toned sentence sang in Evan's heart. Rose and her
      mother were of one stamp. And Rose might speak for her mother. To take the
      hands of such a pair and be lifted out of the slough, he thought no shame:
      and all through the hours of the morning the image of two angels stooping
      to touch a leper, pressed on his brain like a reality, and went divinely
      through his blood.
    
    
      Toward mid-day Rose beckoned to him, and led him out across the lawn into
      the park, and along the borders of the stream.
    
    
      'Evan,' she said, 'shall I really speak to Mama?'
    
    
      'You have not yet?' he answered.
    
    
      'No. I have been with Juliana and with Drummond. Look at this, Evan.' She
      showed a small black speck in the palm of her hand, which turned out, on
      your viewing it closely, to be a brand of the letter L. 'Mama did that
      when I was a little girl, because I told lies. I never could distinguish
      between truth and falsehood; and Mama set that mark on me, and I have
      never told a lie since. She forgives anything but that. She will be our
      friend; she will never forsake us, Evan, if we do not deceive her. Oh,
      Evan! it never is of any use. But deceive her, and she cannot forgive you.
      It is not in her nature.'
    
    
      Evan paused before he replied: 'You have only to tell her what I have told
      you. You know everything.'
    
    
      Rose gave him a flying look of pain: 'Everything, Evan? What do I know?'
    
    
      'Ah, Rose! do you compel me to repeat it?'
    
    
      Bewildered, Rose thought: 'Have I slept and forgotten it?'
    
    
      He saw the persistent grieved interrogation of her eyebrows.
    
    
      'Well!' she sighed resignedly: 'I am yours; you know that, Evan.'
    
    
      But he was a lover, and quarrelled with her sigh.
    
    
      'It may well make you sad now, Rose.'
    
    
      'Sad? no, that does not make me sad. No; but my hands are tied. I cannot
      defend you or justify myself; and induce Mama to stand by us. Oh, Evan!
      you love me! why can you not open your heart to me entirely, and trust
      me?'
    
    
      'More?' cried Evan: 'Can I trust you more?' He spoke of the letter: Rose
      caught his hand.
    
    
      'I never had it, Evan. You wrote it last night? and all was written in it?
      I never saw it       but I know all.'
    
    
      Their eyes fronted. The gates of Rose's were wide open, and he saw no
      hurtful beasts or lurking snakes in the happy garden within, but Love,
      like a fixed star.
    
    
      'Then you know why I must leave, Rose.'
    
    
      'Leave? Leave me? On the contrary, you must stay by me, and support me.
      Why, Evan, we have to fight a battle.'
    
    
      Much as he worshipped her, this intrepid directness of soul startled
      him-almost humbled him. And her eyes shone with a firm cheerful light, as
      she exclaimed: 'It makes me so happy to think you were the first to
      mention this. You meant to be, and that's the same thing. I heard it this
      morning: you wrote it last night. It's you I love, Evan. Your birth, and
      what you were obliged to do       that's nothing. Of course I'm sorry for
      it, dear. But I'm more sorry for the pain I must have sometimes put you
      to. It happened through my mother's father being a merchant; and that side
      of the family the men and women are quite sordid and unendurable; and
      that's how it came that I spoke of disliking tradesmen. I little thought I
      should ever love one sprung from that class.'
    
    
      She turned to him tenderly.
    
    
      'And in spite of what my birth is, you love me, Rose?'
    
    
      'There's no spite in it, Evan. I do.'
    
    
      Hard for him, while his heart was melting to caress her, the thought that
      he had snared this bird of heaven in a net! Rose gave him no time for
      reflection, or the moony imagining of their raptures lovers love to dwell
      upon.
    
    
      'You gave the letter to Polly, of course?'
    
    
      'Yes.'
    
    
      'Oh, naughty Polly! I must punish you,' Rose apostrophized her. 'You might
      have divided us for ever. Well, we shall have to fight a battle, you
      understand that. Will you stand by me?'
    
    
      Would he not risk his soul for her?
    
    
      'Very well, Evan. Then       but don't be sensitive. Oh, how sensitive you
      are! I see it all now. This is what we shall have to do. We shall have to
      speak to Mama to-day       this morning. Drummond has told me he is going
      to speak to her, and we must be first. That 's decided. I begged a couple
      of hours. You must not be offended with Drummond. He does it out of pure
      affection for us, and I can see he's right       or, at least, not quite
      wrong. He ought, I think, to know that he cannot change me. Very well, we
      shall win Mama by what we do. My mother has ten times my wits, and yet I
      manage her like a feather. I have only to be honest and straightforward.
      Then Mama will gain over Papa. Papa, of course, won't like it. He's quiet
      and easy, but he likes blood, but he also likes peace better; and I think
      he loves Rosey       as well as somebody       almost? Look, dear, there
      is our seat where we       where you would rob me of my handkerchief. I
      can't talk any more.'
    
    
      Rose had suddenly fallen from her prattle, soft and short-breathed.
    
    
      'Then, dear,' she went on, 'we shall have to fight the family. Aunt Shorne
      will be terrible. My poor uncles! I pity them. But they will come round.
      They always have thought what I did was right, and why should they change
      their minds now? I shall tell them that at their time of life a change of
      any kind is very unwise and bad for them. Then there is Grandmama Bonner.
      She can hurt us really, if she pleases. Oh, my dear Evan! if you had only
      been a curate! Why isn't your name Parsley? Then my Grandmama the Countess
      of Elburne. Well, we have a Countess on our side, haven't we? And that
      reminds me, Evan, if we're to be happy and succeed, you must promise one
      thing: you will not tell the Countess, your sister. Don't confide this to
      her. Will you promise?'
    
    
      Evan assured her he was not in the habit of pouring secrets into any
      bosom, the Countess's as little as another's.
    
    
      'Very well, then, Evan, it's unpleasant while it lasts, but we shall gain
      the day. Uncle Melville will give you an appointment, and then?'
    
    
      'Yes, Rose,' he said, 'I will do this, though I don't think you can know
      what I shall have to endure-not in confessing what I am, but in feeling
      that I have brought you to my level.'
    
    
      'Does it not raise me?' she cried.
    
    
      He shook his head.
    
    
      'But in reality, Evan       apart from mere appearances       in reality
      it does! it does!'
    
    
      'Men will not think so, Rose, nor can I. Oh, my Rose! how different you
      make me. Up to this hour I have been so weak! torn two ways! You give me
      double strength.'
    
    
      Then these lovers talked of distant days       compared their feelings on
      this and that occasion with mutual wonder and delight. Then the old hours
      lived anew. And       did you really think that, Evan? And       Oh, Rose!
      was that your dream? And the meaning of that by-gone look: was it what
      they fancied? And such and such a tone of voice; would it bear the wished
      interpretation? Thus does Love avenge himself on the unsatisfactory Past
      and call out its essence.
    
    
      Could Evan do less than adore her? She knew all, and she loved him! Since
      he was too shy to allude more than once to his letter, it was natural that
      he should not ask her how she came to know, and how much the 'all' that
      she knew comprised. In his letter he had told all; the condition of his
      parents, and his own. Honestly, now, what with his dazzled state of mind,
      his deep inward happiness, and love's endless delusions, he abstained from
      touching the subject further. Honestly, therefore, as far as a lover can
      be honest.
    
    
      So they toyed, and then Rose, setting her fingers loose, whispered: 'Are
      you ready?' And Evan nodded; and Rose, to make him think light of the
      matter in hand, laughed: 'Pluck not quite up yet?'
    
    
      'Quite, my Rose!' said Evan, and they walked to the house, not quite
      knowing what they were going to do.
    
    
      On the steps they met Drummond with Mrs. Evremonde. Little imagining how
      heart and heart the two had grown, and that Evan would understand him,
      Drummond called to Rose playfully: 'Time's up.'
    
    
      'Is it?' Rose answered, and to Mrs. Evremonde
    
    
      'Give Drummond a walk. Poor Drummond is going silly.'
    
    
      Evan looked into his eyes calmly as he passed.
    
    
      'Where are you going, Rose?' said Mrs. Evremonde.
    
    
      'Going to give my maid Polly a whipping for losing a letter she ought to
      have delivered to me last night,' said Rose, in a loud voice, looking at
      Drummond. 'And then going to Mama. Pleasure first       duty after. Isn't
      that the proverb, Drummond?'
    
    
      She kissed her fingers rather scornfully to her old friend.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XXVI. MRS. MEL MAKES A BED FOR HERSELF AND FAMILY
    
    
      The last person thought of by her children at this period was Mrs. Mel:
      nor had she been thinking much of them till a letter from Mr. Goren
      arrived one day, which caused her to pass them seriously in review. Always
      an early bird, and with maxims of her own on the subject of rising and
      getting the worm, she was standing in a small perch in the corner of the
      shop, dictating accounts to Mrs. Fiske, who was copying hurriedly, that
      she might earn sweet intervals for gossip, when Dandy limped up and
      delivered the letter. Mrs. Fiske worked hard while her aunt was occupied
      in reading it, for a great deal of fresh talk follows the advent of the
      post, and may be reckoned on. Without looking up, however, she could tell
      presently that the letter had been read through. Such being the case, and
      no conversation coming of it, her curiosity was violent. Her aunt's face,
      too, was an index of something extraordinary. That inflexible woman,
      instead of alluding to the letter in any way, folded it up, and renewed
      her dictation. It became a contest between them which should show her
      human nature first. Mrs. Mel had to repress what she knew; Mrs. Fiske to
      control the passion for intelligence. The close neighbourhood of one
      anxious to receive, and one capable of giving, waxed too much for both.
    
    
      'I think, Anne, you are stupid this morning,' said Mrs. Mel.
    
    
      'Well, I am, aunt,' said Mrs. Fiske, pretending not to see which was the
      first to unbend, 'I don't know what it is. The figures seem all dazzled
      like. I shall really be glad when Evan comes to take his proper place.'
    
    
      'Ah!' went Mrs. Mel, and Mrs. Fiske heard her muttering. Then she cried
      out: 'Are Harriet and Caroline as great liars as Louisa?'
    
    
      Mrs. Fiske grimaced. 'That would be difficult, would it not, aunt?'
    
    
      'And I have been telling everybody that my son is in town learning his
      business, when he's idling at a country house, and trying to play his
      father over again! Upon my word, what with liars and fools, if you go to
      sleep a minute you have a month's work on your back.'
    
    
      'What is it, aunt?' Mrs. Fiske feebly inquired.
    
    
      'A gentleman, I suppose! He wouldn't take an order if it was offered. Upon
      my word, when tailors think of winning heiresses it's time we went back to
      Adam and Eve.'
    
    
      'Do you mean Evan, aunt?' interposed Mrs. Fiske, who probably did not see
      the turns in her aunt's mind.
    
    
      'There       read for yourself,' said Mrs. Mel, and left her with the
      letter.
    
    
      Mrs. Fiske read that Mr. Goren had been astonished at Evan's
      non-appearance, and at his total silence; which he did not consider
      altogether gentlemanly behaviour, and certainly not such as his father
      would have practised. Mr. Goren regretted his absence the more as he would
      have found him useful in a remarkable invention he was about to patent,
      being a peculiar red cross upon shirts       a fortune to the patentee;
      but as Mr. Goren had no natural heirs of his body, he did not care for
      that. What affected him painfully was the news of Evan's doings at a noble
      house, Beckley Court, to wit, where, according to the report of a rich
      young gentleman friend, Mr. Raikes (for whose custom Mr. Goren was bound
      to thank Evan), the youth who should have been learning the science of
      Tailoring, had actually passed himself off as a lord, or the son of one,
      or something of the kind, and had got engaged to a wealthy heiress, and
      would, no doubt, marry her if not found out. Where the chances of
      detection were so numerous, Mr. Goren saw much to condemn in the idea of
      such a marriage. But 'like father like son,' said Mr. Goren. He thanked
      the Lord that an honest tradesman was not looked down upon in this
      country; and, in fact, gave Mrs. Mel a few quiet digs to waken her remorse
      in having missed the man that he was.
    
    
      When Mrs. Fiske met her aunt again she returned her the letter, and simply
      remarked: 'Louisa.'
    
    
      Mrs. Mel nodded. She understood the implication.
    
    
      The General who had schemed so successfully to gain Evan time at Beckley
      Court in his own despite and against a hundred obstructions, had now
      another enemy in the field, and one who, if she could not undo her work,
      could punish her. By the afternoon coach, Mrs. Mel, accompanied by Dandy
      her squire, was journeying to Fallow field, bent upon things. The faithful
      squire was kept by her side rather as a security for others than for, his
      particular services. Dandy's arms were crossed, and his countenance was
      gloomy. He had been promised a holiday that afternoon to give his
      mistress, Sally, Kilne's cook, an airing, and Dandy knew in his soul that
      Sally, when she once made up her mind to an excursion, would go, and would
      not go alone, and that her very force of will endangered her constancy. He
      had begged humbly to be allowed to stay, but Mrs. Mel could not trust him.
      She ought to have told him so, perhaps. Explanations were not approved of
      by this well-intended despot, and however beneficial her resolves might
      turn out for all parties, it was natural that in the interim the children
      of her rule should revolt, and Dandy, picturing his Sally flaunting on the
      arm of some accursed low marine, haply, kicked against Mrs. Mel's
      sovereignty, though all that he did was to shoot out his fist from time to
      time, and grunt through his set teeth: 'Iron!' to express the character of
      her awful rule.
    
    
      Mrs. Mel alighted at the Dolphin, the landlady of which was a Mrs.
      Hawkshaw, a rival of Mrs. Sockley of the Green Dragon. She was welcomed by
      Mrs. Hawkshaw with considerable respect. The great Mel had sometimes slept
      at the Dolphin.
    
    
      'Ah, that black!' she sighed, indicating Mrs. Mel's dress and the story it
      told.
    
    
      'I can't give you his room, my dear Mrs. Harrington, wishing I could! I'm
      sorry to say it's occupied, for all I ought to be glad, I dare say, for
      he's an old gentleman who does you a good turn, if you study him. But
      there! I'd rather have had poor dear Mr. Harrington in my best bed than
      old or young       Princes or nobodies, I would       he was that grand
      and pleasant.'
    
    
      Mrs. Mel had her tea in Mrs. Hawkshaw's parlour, and was entertained about
      her husband up to the hour of supper, when a short step and a querulous
      voice were heard in the passage, and an old gentleman appeared before
      them.
    
    
      'Who's to carry up my trunk, ma'am? No man here?'
    
    
      Mrs. Hawkshaw bustled out and tried to lay her hand on a man. Failing to
      find the growth spontaneous, she returned and begged the old gentleman to
      wait a few moments and the trunk would be sent up.
    
    
      'Parcel o' women!' was his reply. 'Regularly bedevilled. Gets worse and
      worse. I 'll carry it up myself.'
    
    
      With a wheezy effort he persuaded the trunk to stand on one end, and then
      looked at it. The exertion made him hot, which may account for the rage he
      burst into when Mrs. Hawkshaw began flutteringly to apologize.
    
    
      'You're sure, ma'am, sure       what are you sure of? I'll tell you what I
      am sure of       eh? This keeping clear of men's a damned pretence. You
      don't impose upon me. Don't believe in your pothouse nunneries       not a
      bit. Just like you! when you are virtuous it's deuced inconvenient. Let
      one of the maids try? No. Don't believe in 'em.'
    
    
      Having thus relieved his spleen the old gentleman addressed himself to
      further efforts and waxed hotter. He managed to tilt the trunk over, and
      thus gained a length, and by this method of progression arrived at the
      foot of the stairs, where he halted, and wiped his face, blowing lustily.
    
    
      Mrs. Mel had been watching him with calm scorn all the while. She saw him
      attempt most ridiculously to impel the trunk upwards by a similar process,
      and thought it time to interfere.
    
    
      'Don't you see you must either take it on your shoulders, or have a help?'
    
    
      The old gentleman sprang up from his peculiarly tight posture to blaze
      round at her. He had the words well-peppered on his mouth, but somehow he
      stopped, and was subsequently content to growl: 'Where 's the help in a
      parcel of petticoats?'
    
    
      Mrs. Mel did not consider it necessary to give him an answer. She went up
      two or three steps, and took hold of one handle of the trunk, saying:
      'There; I think it can be managed this way,' and she pointed for him to
      seize the other end with his hand.
    
    
      He was now in that unpleasant state of prickly heat when testy old
      gentlemen could commit slaughter with ecstasy. Had it been the maid
      holding a candle who had dared to advise, he would have overturned her
      undoubtedly, and established a fresh instance of the impertinence, the
      uselessness and weakness of women. Mrs. Mel topped him by half a head, and
      in addition stood three steps above him; towering like a giantess. The
      extreme gravity of her large face dispersed all idea of an assault. The
      old gentleman showed signs of being horribly injured: nevertheless, he put
      his hand to the trunk; it was lifted, and the procession ascended the
      stairs in silence.
    
    
      The landlady waited for Mrs. Mel to return, and then said:
    
    
      'Really, Mrs. Harrington, you are clever. That lifting that trunk's as
      good as a lock and bolt on him. You've as good as made him a Dolphin       him
      that was one o' the oldest Green Dragons in Fallifield. My thanks to you
      most sincere.'
    
    
      Mrs. Mel sent out to hear where Dandy had got to after which, she said:
      'Who is the man?'
    
    
      'I told you, Mrs. Harrington       the oldest Green Dragon. His name, you
      mean? Do you know, if I was to breathe it out, I believe he'd jump out of
      the window. He 'd be off, that you might swear to. Oh, such a whimsical!
      not ill-meaning       quite the contrary. Study his whims, and you'll
      never want. There's Mrs. Sockley       she 's took ill. He won't go there       that
      's how I've caught him, my dear       but he pays her medicine, and she
      looks to him the same. He hate a sick house: but he pity a sick woman.
      Now, if I can only please him, I can always look on him as half a Dolphin,
      to say the least; and perhaps to-morrow I'll tell you who he is, and what,
      but not to-night; for there's his supper to get over, and that, they say,
      can be as bad as the busting of one of his own vats. Awful!'
    
    
      'What does he eat?' said Mrs. Mel.
    
    
      'A pair o' chops. That seem simple, now, don't it? And yet they chops make
      my heart go pitty-pat.'
    
    
      'The commonest things are the worst done,' said Mrs. Mel.
    
    
      'It ain't that; but they must be done his particular way, do you see, Mrs.
      Harrington. Laid close on the fire, he say, so as to keep in the juice.
      But he ups and bounces in a minute at a speck o' black. So, one thing or
      the other, there you are: no blacks, no juices, I say.'
    
    
      'Toast the chops,' said Mrs. Mel.
    
    
      The landlady of the Dolphin accepted this new idea with much
      enlightenment, but ruefully declared that she was afraid to go against his
      precise instructions. Mrs. Mel then folded her hands, and sat in quiet
      reserve. She was one of those numerous women who always know themselves to
      be right. She was also one of those very few whom Providence favours by
      confounding dissentients. She was positive the chops would be ill-cooked:
      but what could she do? She was not in command here; so she waited serenely
      for the certain disasters to enthrone her. Not that the matter of the
      chops occupied her mind particularly: nor could she dream that the pair in
      question were destined to form a part of her history, and divert the
      channel of her fortunes. Her thoughts were about her own immediate work;
      and when the landlady rushed in with the chops under a cover, and said:
      'Look at 'em, dear Mrs. Harrington!' she had forgotten that she was again
      to be proved right by the turn of events.
    
    
      'Oh, the chops!' she responded. 'Send them while they are hot.'
    
    
      'Send 'em! Why you don't think I'd have risked their cooling? I have sent
      'em; and what do he do but send 'em travelling back, and here they be; and
      what objections his is I might study till I was blind, and I shouldn't see
      'em.'
    
    
      'No; I suppose not,' said Mrs. Mel. 'He won't eat 'em?'
    
    
      'Won't eat anything: but his bed-room candle immediately. And whether his
      sheets are aired. And Mary says he sniffed at the chops; and that gal
      really did expect he 'd fling them at her. I told you what he was. Oh,
      dear!'
    
    
      The bell was heard ringing in the midst of the landlady's lamentations.
    
    
      'Go to him yourself,' said Mrs. Mel. 'No Christian man should go to sleep
      without his supper.'
    
    
      'Ah! but he ain't a common Christian,' returned Mrs. Hawkshaw.
    
    
      The old gentleman was in a hurry to know when his bed-room candle was
      coming up, or whether they intended to give him one at all that night; if
      not, let them say so, as he liked plain-speaking. The moment Mrs. Hawkshaw
      touched upon the chops, he stopped her mouth.
    
    
      'Go about your business, ma'am. You can't cook 'em. I never expected you
      could: I was a fool to try you. It requires at least ten years'
      instruction before a man can get a woman to cook his chop as he likes it.'
    
    
      'But what was your complaint, sir?' said Mrs. Hawkshaw, imploringly.
    
    
      'That's right!' and he rubbed his hands, and brightened his eyes savagely.
      'That's the way. Opportunity for gossip! Thing's well done       down it
      goes: you know that. You can't have a word over it       eh? Thing's done
      fit to toss on a dungheap, aha! Then there's a cackle! My belief is, you
      do it on purpose. Can't be such rank idiots. You do it on purpose. All
      done for gossip!'
    
    
      'Oh, sir, no!' The landlady half curtsied.
    
    
      'Oh, ma'am, yes!' The old gentleman bobbed his head.
    
    
      'No, indeed, sir!' The landlady shook hers.
    
    
      'Damn it, ma'am, I swear you do.'
    
    
      Symptoms of wrath here accompanied the declaration; and, with a sigh and a
      very bitter feeling, Mrs. Hawkshaw allowed him to have the last word.
      Apparently this       which I must beg to call the lady's morsel       comforted
      his irascible system somewhat; for he remained in a state of composure
      eight minutes by the clock. And mark how little things hang together.
      Another word from the landlady, precipitating a retort from him, and a
      gesture or muttering from her; and from him a snapping outburst, and from
      her a sign that she held out still; in fact, had she chosen to battle for
      that last word, as in other cases she might have done, then would he have
      exploded, gone to bed in the dark, and insisted upon sleeping: the
      consequence of which would have been to change this history. Now while
      Mrs. Hawkshaw was upstairs, Mrs. Mel called the servant, who took her to
      the kitchen, where she saw a prime loin of mutton; off which she cut two
      chops with a cunning hand: and these she toasted at a gradual distance,
      putting a plate beneath them, and a tin behind, and hanging the chops so
      that they would turn without having to be pierced. The bell rang twice
      before she could say the chops were ready. The first time, the maid had to
      tell the old gentleman she was taking up his water. Her next excuse was,
      that she had dropped her candle. The chops ready       who was to take
      them?
    
    
      'Really, Mrs. Harrington, you are so clever, you ought, if I might be so
      bold as say so; you ought to end it yourself,' said the landlady. 'I can't
      ask him to eat them: he was all but on the busting point when I left him.'
    
    
      'And that there candle did for him quite,' said Mary, the maid.
    
    
      'I'm afraid it's chops cooked for nothing,' added the landlady.
    
    
      Mrs. Mel saw them endangered. The maid held back: the landlady feared.
    
    
      'We can but try,' she said.
    
    
      'Oh! I wish, mum, you'd face him, 'stead o' me,' said Mary; 'I do dread
      that old bear's den.'
    
    
      'Here, I will go,' said Mrs. Mel. 'Has he got his ale? Better draw it
      fresh, if he drinks any.'
    
    
      And upstairs she marched, the landlady remaining below to listen for the
      commencement of the disturbance. An utterance of something certainly
      followed Mrs. Mel's entrance into the old bear's den. Then silence. Then
      what might have been question and answer. Then       was Mrs. Mel
      assaulted? and which was knocked down? It really was a chair being moved
      to the table. The door opened.
    
    
      'Yes, ma'am; do what you like,' the landlady heard. Mrs. Mel descended,
      saying: 'Send him up some fresh ale.'
    
    
      'And you have made him sit down obedient to those chops?' cried the
      landlady. 'Well might poor dear Mr. Harrington       pleasant man as he
      was!       say, as he used to say, "There's lovely women in the world,
      Mrs. Hawkshaw," he'd say, "and there's Duchesses," he'd say, "and there's
      they that can sing, and can dance, and some," he says, "that can cook."
      But he'd look sly as he'd stoop his head and shake it. "Roll 'em into
      one," he says, "and not any of your grand ladies can match my wife at
      home."
    
    
      And, indeed, Mrs. Harrington, he told me he thought so many a time in the
      great company he frequented.'
    
    
      Perfect peace reigning above, Mrs. Hawkshaw and Mrs. Mel sat down to
      supper below; and Mrs. Hawkshaw talked much of the great one gone. His
      relict did not care to converse about the dead, save in their practical
      aspect as ghosts; but she listened, and that passed the time. By-and-by,
      the old gentleman rang, and sent a civil message to know if the landlady
      had ship's rum in the house.
    
    
      'Dear! here's another trouble,' cried the poor woman. 'No       none!'
    
    
      'Say, yes,' said Mrs. Mel, and called Dandy, and charged him to run down
      the street to the square, and ask for the house of Mr. Coxwell, the
      maltster, and beg of him, in her name, a bottle of his ship's rum.
    
    
      'And don't you tumble down and break the bottle, Dandy. Accidents with
      spirit-bottles are not excused.'
    
    
      Dandy went on the errand, after an energetic grunt.
    
    
      In due time he returned with the bottle, whole and sound, and Mr.
      Coxwell's compliments. Mrs. Mel examined the cork to see that no process
      of suction had been attempted, and then said:
    
    
      'Carry it up to him, Dandy. Let him see there's a man in the house besides
      himself.'
    
    
      'Why, my dear,' the landlady turned to her, 'it seems natural to you to be
      mistress where you go. I don't at all mind, for ain't it my profit? But
      you do take us off our legs.'
    
    
      Then the landlady, warmed by gratitude, told her that the old gentleman
      was the great London brewer, who brewed there with his brother, and brewed
      for himself five miles out of Fallow field, half of which and a good part
      of the neighbourhood he owned, and his name was Mr. Tom Cogglesby.
    
    
      'Oh!' said Mrs. Mel. 'And his brother is Mr. Andrew.'
    
    
      'That 's it,' said the landlady. 'And because he took it into his head to
      go and to choose for himself, and be married, no getting his brother, Mr.
      Tom, to speak to him. Why not, indeed? If there's to be no marrying, the
      sooner we lay down and give up, the better, I think. But that 's his way.
      He do hate us women, Mrs. Harrington. I have heard he was crossed. Some
      say it was the lady of Beckley Court, who was a Beauty, when he was only a
      poor cobbler's son.'
    
    
      Mrs. Mel breathed nothing of her relationship to Mr. Tom, but continued
      from time to time to express solicitude about Dandy. They heard the door
      open, and old Tom laughing in a capital good temper, and then Dandy came
      down, evidently full of ship's rum.
    
    
      'He's pumped me!' said Dandy, nodding heavily at his mistress.
    
    
      Mrs. Mel took him up to his bed-room, and locked the door. On her way back
      she passed old Tom's chamber, and his chuckles were audible to her.
    
    
      'They finished the rum,' said Mrs. Hawkshaw.
    
    
      'I shall rate him for that to-morrow,' said Mrs. Mel. 'Giving that poor
      beast liquor!'
    
    
      'Rate Mr. Tom! Oh! Mrs. Harrington! Why, he'll snap your head off for a
      word.'
    
    
      Mrs. Mel replied that her head would require a great deal of snapping to
      come off.
    
    
      During this conversation they had both heard a singular intermittent noise
      above. Mrs. Hawkshaw was the first to ask:
    
    
      'What can it be? More trouble with him? He's in his bed-room now.'
    
    
      'Mad with drink, like Dandy, perhaps,' said Mrs. Mel.
    
    
      'Hark!' cried the landlady. 'Oh!'
    
    
      It seemed that Old Tom was bouncing about in an extraordinary manner. Now
      came a pause, as if he had sworn to take his rest: now the room shook and
      the windows rattled.
    
    
      'One 'd think, really, his bed was a frying-pan, and him a live fish in
      it,' said the landlady. 'Oh       there, again! My goodness! have he got a
      flea?'
    
    
      The thought was alarming. Mrs. Mel joined in:
    
    
      'Or a                      '
    
    
      'Don't! don't, my dear!' she was cut short. 'Oh! one o' them little things
      'd be ruin to me. To think o' that! Hark at him! It must be. And what's to
      do? I 've sent the maids to bed. We haven't a man. If I was to go and
      knock at his door, and ask?'
    
    
      'Better try and get him to be quiet somehow.'
    
    
      'Ah! I dare say I shall make him fire out fifty times worse.'
    
    
      Mrs. Hawkshaw stipulated that Mrs. Mel should stand by her, and the two
      women went up-stairs and stood at Old Tom's door. There they could hear
      him fuming and muttering imprecations, and anon there was an interval of
      silence, and then the room was shaken, and the cursings recommenced.
    
    
      'It must be a fight he 's having with a flea,' said the landlady. 'Oh!
      pray heaven, it is a flea. For a flea, my dear-gentlemen may bring that
      theirselves; but a b              -, that's a stationary, and born of a
      bed. Don't you hear? The other thing 'd give him a minute's rest; but a
      flea's hop-hop-off and on. And he sound like an old gentleman worried by a
      flea. What are you doing?'
    
    
      Mrs. Mel had knocked at the door. The landlady waited breathlessly for the
      result. It appeared to have quieted Old Tom.
    
    
      'What's the matter?' said Mrs. Mel, severely.
    
    
      The landlady implored her to speak him fair, and reflect on the desperate
      things he might attempt.
    
    
      'What's the matter? Can anything be done for you?'
    
    
      Mr. Tom Cogglesby's reply comprised an insinuation so infamous regarding
      women when they have a solitary man in their power, that it cannot be
      placed on record.
    
    
      'Is anything the matter with your bed?'
    
    
      'Anything? Yes; anything is the matter, ma'am. Hope twenty live geese
      inside it's enough-eh? Bed, do you call it? It's the rack! It's damnation!
      Bed? Ha!'
    
    
      After delivering this, he was heard stamping up and down the room.
    
    
      'My very best bed!' whispered the landlady. 'Would it please you, sir, to
      change       I can give you another?'
    
    
      'I'm not a man of experiments, ma'am-'specially in strange houses.'
    
    
      'So very, very sorry!'
    
    
      'What the deuce!' Old Tom came close to the door. 'You whimpering! You put
      a man in a beast of a bed       you drive him half mad       and then
      begin to blubber! Go away.'
    
    
      'I am so sorry, sir!'
    
    
      'If you don't go away, ma'am, I shall think your intentions are improper.'
    
    
      'Oh, my goodness!' cried poor Mrs. Hawkshaw. 'What can one do with him?'
      Mrs. Mel put Mrs. Hawkshaw behind her.
    
    
      'Are you dressed?' she called out.
    
    
      In this way Mrs. Mel tackled Old Tom. He was told that should he consent
      to cover himself decently, she would come into his room and make his bed
      comfortable. And in a voice that dispersed armies of innuendoes, she bade
      him take his choice, either to rest quiet or do her bidding. Had Old Tom
      found his master at last, and in one of the hated sex? Breathlessly Mrs.
      Hawkshaw waited his answer, and she was an astonished woman when it came.
    
    
      'Very well, ma'am. Wait a couple of minutes. Do as you like.'
    
    
      On their admission to the interior of the chamber, Old Tom was exhibited
      in his daily garb, sufficiently subdued to be civil and explain the cause
      of his discomfort. Lumps in his bed: he was bruised by them. He supposed
      he couldn't ask women to judge for themselves       they'd be shrieking       but
      he could assure them he was blue all down his back. Mrs. Mel and Mrs.
      Hawkshaw turned the bed about, and punched it, and rolled it.
    
    
      'Ha!' went Old Tom, 'what's the good of that? That's just how I found it.
      Moment I got into bed geese began to put up their backs.'
    
    
      Mrs. Mel seldom indulged in a joke, and then only when it had a proverbial
      cast. On the present occasion, the truth struck her forcibly, and she
      said:
    
    
      'One fool makes many, and so, no doubt, does one goose.'
    
    
      Accompanied by a smile the words would have seemed impudent; but spoken as
      a plain fact, and with a grave face, it set Old Tom blinking like a small
      boy ten minutes after the whip.
    
    
      'Now,' she pursued, speaking to him as to an old child, 'look here. This
      is how you manage. Knead down in the middle of the bed. Then jump into the
      hollow. Lie there, and you needn't wake till morning.'
    
    
      Old Tom came to the side of the bed. He had prepared himself for a
      wretched night, an uproar, and eternal complaints against the house, its
      inhabitants, and its foundations; but a woman stood there who as much as
      told him that digging his fist into the flock and jumping into the hole       into
      that hole under his, eyes       was all that was wanted! that he had been
      making a noise for nothing, and because he had not the wit to hit on a
      simple contrivance! Then, too, his jest about the geese       this woman
      had put a stop to that! He inspected the hollow cynically. A man might
      instruct him on a point or two: Old Tom was not going to admit that a
      woman could.
    
    
      'Oh, very well; thank you, ma'am; that's your idea. I'll try it. Good
      night.'
    
    
      'Good night,' returned Mrs. Mel. 'Don't forget to jump into the middle.'
    
    
      'Head foremost, ma'am?'
    
    
      'As you weigh,' said Mrs. Mel, and Old Tom trumped his lips, silenced if
      not beaten. Beaten, one might almost say, for nothing more was heard of
      him that night.
    
    
      He presented himself to Mrs. Mel after breakfast next morning.
    
    
      'Slept well, ma'am.'
    
    
      'Oh! then you did as I directed you,' said Mrs. Mel.
    
    
      'Those chops, too, very good. I got through 'em.'
    
    
      'Eating, like scratching, only wants a beginning,' said Mrs. Mel.
    
    
      'Ha! you've got your word, then, as well as everybody else. Where's your
      Dandy this morning, ma'am?'
    
    
      'Locked up. You ought to be ashamed to give that poor beast liquor. He
      won't get fresh air to-day.'
    
    
      'Ha! May I ask you where you're going to-day, ma'am?'
    
    
      'I am going to Beckley.'
    
    
      'So am I, ma'am. What d' ye say, if we join company. Care for
      insinuations?'
    
    
      'I want a conveyance of some sort,' returned Mrs. Mel.
    
    
      'Object to a donkey, ma'am?'
    
    
      'Not if he's strong and will go.'
    
    
      'Good,' said Old Tom; and while he spoke a donkey-cart stopped in front of
      the Dolphin, and a well-dressed man touched his hat.
    
    
      'Get out of that damned bad habit, will you?' growled Old Tom. What do you
      mean by wearing out the brim o' your hat in that way? Help this woman in.'
    
    
      Mrs. Mel helped herself to a part of the seat.
    
    
      'We are too much for the donkey,' she said.
    
    
      'Ha, that's right. What I have, ma'am, is good. I can't pretend to horses,
      but my donkey's the best. Are you going to cry about him?'
    
    
      'No. When he's tired I shall either walk or harness you,' said Mrs. Mel.
    
    
      This was spoken half-way down the High Street of Fallow field. Old Tom
      looked full in her face, and bawled out:
    
    
      'Deuce take it. Are you a woman?'
    
    
      'I have borne three girls and one boy,' said Mrs. Mel.
    
    
      'What sort of a husband?'
    
    
      'He is dead.'
    
    
      'Ha! that's an opening, but 'tain't an answer. I'm off to Beckley on a
      marriage business. I 'm the son of a cobbler, so I go in a donkey-cart. No
      damned pretences for me. I'm going to marry off a young tailor to a gal
      he's been playing the lord to. If she cares for him she'll take him: if
      not, they're all the luckier, both of 'em.'
    
    
      'What's the tailor's name?' said Mrs. Mel.
    
    
      'You are a woman,' returned Old Tom. 'Now, come, ma'am, don't you feel
      ashamed of being in a donkeycart?'
    
    
      'I 'm ashamed of men, sometimes,' said Mrs. Mel; 'never of animals.'
    
    
      ''Shamed o' me, perhaps.'
    
    
      'I don't know you.'
    
    
      'Ha! well! I'm a man with no pretences. Do you like 'em? How have you
      brought up your three girls and one boy? No pretences       eh?'
    
    
      Mrs. Mel did not answer, and Old Tom jogged the reins and chuckled, and
      asked his donkey if he wanted to be a racer.
    
    
      'Should you take me for a gentleman, ma'am?'
    
    
      'I dare say you are, sir, at heart. Not from your manner of speech.'
    
    
      'I mean appearances, ma'am.'
    
    
      'I judge by the disposition.'
    
    
      'You do, ma'am? Then, deuce take it, if you are a woman, you 're               -'
      Old Tom had no time to conclude.
    
    
      A great noise of wheels, and a horn blown, caused them both to turn their
      heads, and they beheld a curricle descending upon them vehemently, and a
      fashionably attired young gentleman straining with all his might at the
      reins. The next instant they were rolling on the bank. About twenty yards
      ahead the curricle was halted and turned about to see the extent of the
      mischief done.
    
    
      'Pardon, a thousand times, my worthy couple,' cried the sonorous Mr.
      Raikes. 'What we have seen we swear not to divulge. Franco and Fred       your
      pledge!'
    
    
      'We swear!' exclaimed this couple.
    
    
      But suddenly the cheeks of Mr. John Raikes flushed. He alighted from the
      box, and rushing up to Old Tom, was shouting, 'My bene       '
    
    
      'Do you want my toe on your plate?' Old Tom stopped him with.
    
    
      The mysterious words completely changed the aspect of Mr. John Raikes. He
      bowed obsequiously and made his friend Franco step down and assist in the
      task of reestablishing the donkey, who fortunately had received no damage.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XXVII. EXHIBITS ROSE'S GENERALSHIP; EVAN'S PERFORMANCE ON THE
    
    
      SECOND FIDDLE; AND THE WRETCHEDNESS OF THE COUNTESS
    
    
      We left Rose and Evan on their way to Lady Jocelyn. At the library-door
      Rose turned to him, and with her chin archly lifted sideways, said:
    
    
      'I know what you feel; you feel foolish.'
    
    
      Now the sense of honour, and of the necessity of acting the part it
      imposes on him, may be very strong in a young man; but certainly, as a
      rule, the sense of ridicule is more poignant, and Evan was suffering
      horrid pangs. We none of us like to play second fiddle. To play second
      fiddle to a young woman is an abomination to us all. But to have to
      perform upon that instrument to the darling of our hearts       would we
      not rather die? nay, almost rather end the duet precipitately and with
      violence. Evan, when he passed Drummond into the house, and quietly
      returned his gaze, endured the first shock of this strange feeling. There
      could be no doubt that he was playing second fiddle to Rose. And what was
      he about to do? Oh, horror! to stand like a criminal, and say, or worse,
      have said for him, things to tip the ears with fire! To tell the young
      lady's mother that he had won her daughter's love, and meant       what
      did he mean? He knew not. Alas! he was second fiddle; he could only mean
      what she meant. Evan loved Rose deeply and completely, but noble manhood
      was strong in him. You may sneer at us, if you please, ladies. We have
      been educated in a theory, that when you lead off with the bow, the order
      of Nature is reversed, and it is no wonder therefore, that, having stript
      us of one attribute, our fine feathers moult, and the majestic cock-like
      march which distinguishes us degenerates. You unsex us, if I may dare to
      say so. Ceasing to be men, what are we? If we are to please you rightly,
      always allow us to play First.
    
    
      Poor Evan did feel foolish. Whether Rose saw it in his walk, or had a
      loving feminine intuition of it, and was aware of the golden rule I have
      just laid down, we need not inquire. She hit the fact, and he could only
      stammer, and bid her open the door.
    
    
      'No,' she said, after a slight hesitation, 'it will be better that I
      should speak to Mama alone, I see. Walk out on the lawn, dear, and wait
      for me. And if you meet Drummond, don't be angry with him. Drummond is
      very fond of me, and of course I shall teach him to be fond of you. He
      only thinks... what is not true, because he does not know you. I do
      thoroughly, and there, you see, I give you my hand.'
    
    
      Evan drew the dear hand humbly to his lips. Rose then nodded meaningly,
      and let her eyes dwell on him, and went in to her mother to open the
      battle.
    
    
      Could it be that a flame had sprung up in those grey eyes latterly? Once
      they were like morning before sunrise. How soft and' warm and tenderly
      transparent they could now be! Assuredly she loved him. And he, beloved by
      the noblest girl ever fashioned, why should he hang his head, and shrink
      at the thought of human faces, like a wretch doomed to the pillory? He
      visioned her last glance, and lightning emotions of pride and happiness
      flashed through his veins. The generous, brave heart! Yes, with her hand
      in his, he could stand at bay       meet any fate. Evan accepted Rose
      because he believed in her love, and judged it by the strength of his own;
      her sacrifice of her position he accepted, because in his soul he knew he
      should have done no less. He mounted to the level of her nobleness, and
      losing nothing of the beauty of what she did, it was not so strange to
      him.
    
    
      Still there was the baleful reflection that he was second fiddle to his
      beloved. No harmony came of it in his mind. How could he take an
      initiative? He walked forth on the lawn, where a group had gathered under
      the shade of a maple, consisting of Drummond Forth, Mrs. Evremonde, Mrs.
      Shorne, Mr. George Uplift, Seymour Jocelyn, and Ferdinand Laxley. A little
      apart Juliana Bonner was walking with Miss Carrington. Juliana, when she
      saw him, left her companion, and passing him swiftly, said, 'Follow me
      presently into the conservatory.'
    
    
      Evan strolled near the group, and bowed to Mrs. Shorne, whom he had not
      seen that morning.
    
    
      The lady's acknowledgement of his salute was constrained, and but a shade
      on the side of recognition. They were silent till he was out of earshot.
      He noticed that his second approach produced the same effect. In the
      conservatory Juliana was awaiting him.
    
    
      'It is not to give you roses I called you here, Mr. Harrington,' she said.
    
    
      'Not if I beg one?' he responded.
    
    
      'Ah! but you do not want them from... It depends on the person.'
    
    
      'Pluck this,' said Evan, pointing to a white rose.
    
    
      She put her fingers to the stem.
    
    
      What folly!' she cried, and turned from it.
    
    
      'Are you afraid that I shall compromise you?' asked Evan.
    
    
      'You care for me too little for that.'
    
    
      'My dear Miss Bonner!'
    
    
      'How long did you know Rose before you called her by her Christian name?'
    
    
      Evan really could not remember, and was beginning to wonder what he had
      been called there for. The little lady had feverish eyes and fingers, and
      seemed to be burning to speak, but afraid.
    
    
      'I thought you had gone,' she dropped her voice, 'without wishing me
      good-bye.'
    
    
      'I certainly should not do that, Miss Bonner.'
    
    
      'Formal!' she exclaimed, half to herself. 'Miss Bonner thanks you. Do you
      think I wish you to stay? No friend of yours would wish it. You do not
      know the selfishness       brutal!       of these people of birth, as they
      call it.'
    
    
      'I have met with nothing but kindness here,' said Evan.
    
    
      'Then go while you can feel that,' she answered; 'for it cannot last
      another hour. Here is the rose.' She broke it from the stem and handed it
      to him. 'You may wear that, and they are not so likely to call you an
      adventurer, and names of that sort. I am hardly considered a lady by
      them.'
    
    
      An adventurer! The full meaning of the phrase struck Evan's senses when he
      was alone. Miss Bonner knew something of his condition, evidently. Perhaps
      it was generally known, and perhaps it was thought that he had come to win
      Rose for his worldly advantage! The idea was overwhelmingly new to him. Up
      started self-love in arms. He would renounce her.
    
    
      It is no insignificant contest when love has to crush self-love utterly.
      At moments it can be done. Love has divine moments. There are times also
      when Love draws part of his being from self-love, and can find no support
      without it.
    
    
      But how could he renounce her, when she came forth to him,       smiling,
      speaking freshly and lightly, and with the colour on her cheeks which
      showed that she had done her part? How could he retract a step?
    
    
      'I have told Mama, Evan. That's over. She heard it first from me.'
    
    
      'And she?'
    
    
      'Dear Evan, if you are going to be sensitive, I'll run away. You that fear
      no danger, and are the bravest man I ever knew! I think you are really
      trembling. She will speak to Papa, and then       and then, I suppose,
      they will both ask you whether you intend to give me up, or no. I'm afraid
      you'll do the former.'
    
    
      'Your mother       Lady Jocelyn listened to you, Rose? You told her all?'
    
    
      'Every bit.'
    
    
      'And what does she think of me?'
    
    
      'Thinks you very handsome and astonishing, and me very idiotic and
      natural, and that there is a great deal of bother in the world, and that
      my noble relatives will lay the blame of it on her. No, dear, not all
      that; but she talked very sensibly to me, and kindly. You know she is
      called a philosopher: nobody knows how deep-hearted she is, though. My
      mother is true as steel. I can't separate the kindness from the sense, or
      I would tell you all she said. When I say kindness, I don't mean any "Oh,
      my child," and tears, and kisses, and maundering, you know. You mustn't
      mind her thinking me a little fool. You want to know what she thinks of
      you. She said nothing to hurt you, Evan, and we have gained ground so far,
      and now we'll go and face our enemies. Uncle Mel expects to hear about
      your appointment, in a day or two, and              '
    
    
      'Oh, Rose!' Evan burst out.
    
    
      'What is it?'
    
    
      'Why must I owe everything to you?'
    
    
      'Why, dear? Why, because, if you do, it's very much better than your owing
      it to anybody else. Proud again?'
    
    
      Not proud: only second fiddle.
    
    
      'You know, dear Evan, when two people love, there is no such thing as
      owing between them.'
    
    
      'Rose, I have been thinking. It is not too late. I love you, God knows! I
      did in Portugal: I do now       more and more. But Oh, my bright angel!'
      he ended the sentence in his breast.
    
    
      'Well? but       what?'
    
    
      Evan sounded down the meaning of his 'but.' Stripped of the usual heroics,
      it was, 'what will be thought of me?' not a small matter to any of us. He
      caught a distant glimpse of the little bit of bare selfishness, and shrank
      from it.
    
    
      'Too late,' cried Rose. 'The battle has commenced now, and, Mr.
      Harrington, I will lean on your arm, and be led to my dear friends yonder.
      Do they think that I am going to put on a mask to please them? Not for
      anybody! What they are to know they may as well know at once.'
    
    
      She looked in Evan's face.
    
    
      'Do you hesitate?'
    
    
      He felt the contrast between his own and hers; between the niggard spirit
      of the beggarly receiver, and the high bloom of the exalted giver.
      Nevertheless, he loved her too well not to share much of her nature, and
      wedding it suddenly, he said:
    
    
      'Rose; tell me, now. If you were to see the place where I was born, could
      you love me still?'
    
    
      'Yes, Evan.'
    
    
      'If you were to hear me spoken of with contempt       '
    
    
      'Who dares?' cried Rose. 'Never to me!'
    
    
      'Contempt of what I spring from, Rose. Names used... Names are used ...'
    
    
      'Tush!       names!' said Rose, reddening. 'How cowardly that is! Have you
      finished? Oh, faint heart! I suppose I'm not a fair lady, or you wouldn't
      have won me. Now, come. Remember, Evan, I conceal nothing; and if anything
      makes you wretched here, do think how I love you.'
    
    
      In his own firm belief he had said everything to arrest her in her course,
      and been silenced by transcendent logic. She thought the same.
    
    
      Rose made up to the conclave under the maple.
    
    
      The voices hushed as they approached.
    
    
      'Capital weather,' said Rose. 'Does Harry come back from London to-morrow       does
      anybody know?'
    
    
      'Not aware,' Laxley was heard to reply.
    
    
      'I want to speak a word to you, Rose,' said Mrs. Shorne.
    
    
      'With the greatest pleasure, my dear aunt': and Rose walked after her.
    
    
      'My dear Rose,' Mrs. Shorne commenced, 'your conduct requires that I
      should really talk to you most seriously. You are probably not aware of
      what you are doing: Nobody likes ease and natural familiarity more than I
      do. I am persuaded it is nothing but your innocence. You are young to the
      world's ways, and perhaps a little too headstrong, and vain.'
    
    
      'Conceited and wilful,' added Rose.
    
    
      'If you like the words better. But I must say       I do not wish to
      trouble your father       you know he cannot bear worry       but I must
      say, that if you do not listen to me, he must be spoken to.'
    
    
      'Why not Mama?'
    
    
      'I should naturally select my brother first. No doubt you understand me.'
    
    
      'Any distant allusion to Mr. Harrington?'
    
    
      'Pertness will not avail you, Rose.'
    
    
      'So you want me to do secretly what I am doing openly?'
    
    
      'You must and shall remember you are a Jocelyn, Rose.'
    
    
      'Only half, my dear aunt!'
    
    
      'And by birth a lady, Rose.'
    
    
      'And I ought to look under my eyes, and blush, and shrink, whenever I come
      near a gentleman, aunt!'
    
    
      'Ah! my dear. No doubt you will do what is most telling. Since you have
      spoken of this Mr. Harrington, I must inform you that I have it on certain
      authority from two or three sources, that he is the son of a small
      shopkeeper at Lymport.'
    
    
      Mrs. Shorne watched the effect she had produced.
    
    
      'Indeed, aunt?' cried Rose. 'And do you know this to be true?'
    
    
      'So when you talk of gentlemen, Rose, please be careful whom you include.'
    
    
      'I mustn't include poor Mr. Harrington? Then my Grandpapa Bonner is out of
      the list, and such numbers of good worthy men?'
    
    
      Mrs. Shorne understood the hit at the defunct manufacturer. She said: 'You
      must most distinctly give me your promise, while this young adventurer
      remains here       I think it will not be long       not to be
      compromising yourself further, as you now do. Or       indeed I must       I
      shall let your parents perceive that such conduct is ruin to a young girl
      in your position, and certainly you will be sent to Elburne House for the
      winter.'
    
    
      Rose lifted her hands, crying: 'Ye Gods!       as Harry says. But I'm very
      much obliged to you, my dear aunt. Concerning Mr. Harrington, wonderfully
      obliged. Son of a small              -! Is it a t-t-tailor, aunt?'
    
    
      'It is       I have heard.'
    
    
      'And that is much worse. Cloth is viler than cotton! And don't they call
      these creatures sn-snips? Some word of that sort?'
    
    
      'It makes little difference what they are called.'
    
    
      'Well, aunt, I sincerely thank you. As this subject seems to interest you,
      go and see Mama, now. She can tell you a great deal more: and, if you want
      her authority, come back to me.'
    
    
      Rose then left her aunt in a state of extreme indignation. It was a clever
      move to send Mrs. Shorne to Lady Jocelyn. They were antagonistic, and,
      rational as Lady Jocelyn was, and with her passions under control, she was
      unlikely to side with Mrs. Shorne.
    
    
      Now Rose had fought against herself, and had, as she thought, conquered.
      In Portugal Evan's half insinuations had given her small suspicions, which
      the scene on board the Jocasta had half confirmed: and since she came to
      communicate with her own mind, she bore the attack of all that rose
      against him, bit by bit. She had not been too blind to see the
      unpleasantness of the fresh facts revealed to her. They did not change
      her; on the contrary, drew her to him faster       and she thought she had
      completely conquered whatever could rise against him. But when Juliana
      Bonner told her that day that Evan was not only the son of the thing, but
      the thing himself, and that his name could be seen any day in Lymport, and
      that he had come from the shop to Beckley, poor Rosey had a sick feeling
      that almost sank her. For a moment she looked back wildly to the doors of
      retreat. Her eyes had to feed on Evan, she had to taste some of the luxury
      of love, before she could gain composure, and then her arrogance towards
      those she called her enemies did not quite return.
    
    
      'In that letter you told me all       all       all, Evan?'
    
    
      'Yes, all-religiously.'
    
    
      'Oh, why did I miss it!'
    
    
      'Would it give you pleasure?'
    
    
      She feared to speak, being tender as a mother to his sensitiveness. The
      expressive action of her eyebrows sufficed. She could not bear
      concealment, or doubt, or a shadow of dishonesty; and he, gaining force of
      soul to join with hers, took her hands and related the contents of the
      letter fully. She was pale when he had finished. It was some time before
      she was able to get free from the trammels of prejudice, but when she did,
      she did without reserve, saying: 'Evan, there is no man who would have
      done so much.' These little exaltations and generosities bind lovers
      tightly. He accepted the credit she gave him, and at that we need not
      wonder. It helped him further to accept herself, otherwise could he       his
      name known to be on a shop-front       have aspired to her still? But, as
      an unexampled man, princely in soul, as he felt, why, he might kneel to
      Rose Jocelyn. So they listened to one another, and blinded the world by
      putting bandages on their eyes, after the fashion of little boys and
      girls.
    
    
      Meantime the fair being who had brought these two from the ends of the
      social scale into this happy tangle, the beneficent Countess, was
      wretched. When you are in the enemy's country you are dependent on the
      activity and zeal of your spies and scouts, and the best of these       Polly
      Wheedle, to wit       had proved defective, recalcitrant even. And because
      a letter had been lost in her room! as the Countess exclaimed to herself,
      though Polly gave her no reasons. The Countess had, therefore, to rely
      chiefly upon personal observation, upon her intuitions, upon her
      sensations in the proximity of the people to whom she was opposed; and
      from these she gathered that she was, to use the word which seemed fitting
      to her, betrayed. Still to be sweet, still to smile and to amuse,       still
      to give her zealous attention to the business of the diplomatist's
      Election, still to go through her church-services devoutly, required
      heroism; she was equal to it, for she had remarkable courage; but it was
      hard to feel no longer at one with Providence. Had not Providence
      suggested Sir Abraham to her? killed him off at the right moment in aid of
      her? And now Providence had turned, and the assistance she had formerly
      received from that Power, and given thanks for so profusely, was the cause
      of her terror. It was absolutely as if she had been borrowing from a Jew,
      and were called upon to pay fifty-fold interest.
    
    
      'Evan!' she writes in a gasp to Harriet. 'We must pack up and depart.
      Abandon everything. He has disgraced us all, and ruined himself.
      Impossible that we can stay for the pic-nic. We are known, dear. Think of
      my position one day in this house! Particulars when I embrace you. I dare
      not trust a letter here. If Evan had confided in me! He is impenetrable.
      He will be low all his life, and I refuse any more to sully myself in
      attempting to lift him. For Silva's sake I must positively break the
      connection. Heaven knows what I have done for this boy, and will support
      me in the feeling that I have done enough. My conscience at least is
      safe.'
    
    
      Like many illustrious Generals, the Countess had, for the hour, lost
      heart. We find her, however, the next day, writing:
    
    
      'Oh! Harriet! what trials for sisterly affection! Can I possibly       weather
      the gale, as the old L               sailors used to say? It is dreadful.
      I fear I am by duty bound to stop on. Little Bonner thinks Evan quite a
      duke's son, has been speaking to her Grandmama, and to-day, this morning,
      the venerable old lady quite as much as gave me to understand that an
      union between our brother and her son's child would sweetly gratify her,
      and help her to go to her rest in peace. Can I chase that spark of comfort
      from one so truly pious? Dearest Juliana! I have anticipated Evan's
      feeling for her, and so she thinks his conduct cold. Indeed, I told her,
      point blank, he loved her. That, you know, is different from saying, dying
      of love, which would have been an untruth. But, Evan, of course! No
      getting him! Should Juliana ever reproach me, I can assure the child that
      any man is in love with any woman       which is really the case. It is,
      you dear humdrum! what the dictionary calls "nascent." I never liked the
      word, but it stands for a fact.'
    
    
      The Countess here exhibits the weakness of a self-educated intelligence.
      She does not comprehend the joys of scholarship in her employment of
      Latinisms. It will be pardoned to her by those who perceive the profound
      piece of feminine discernment which precedes it.
    
    
      'I do think I shall now have courage to stay out the pic-nic,' she
      continues. 'I really do not think all is known. Very little can be known,
      or I am sure I could not feel as I do. It would burn me up. George Up       -does
      not dare; and his most beautiful lady-love had far better not. Mr. Forth
      may repent his whispers. But, Oh! what Evan may do! Rose is almost
      detestable. Manners, my dear? Totally deficient!
    
    
      'An ally has just come. Evan's good fortune is most miraculous. His low
      friend turns out to be a young Fortunatus; very original, sparkling, and
      in my hands to be made much of. I do think he will       for he is most
      zealous       he will counteract that hateful Mr. Forth, who may soon have
      work enough. Mr. Raikes (Evan's friend) met a mad captain in Fallow field!
      Dear Mr. Raikes is ready to say anything; not from love of falsehood, but
      because he is ready to think it. He has confessed to me that Evan told
      him! Louisa de Saldar has changed his opinion, and much impressed this
      eccentric young gentleman. Do you know any young girl who wants a fortune,
      and would be grateful?
    
    
      'Dearest! I have decided on the pic-nic. Let your conscience be clear, and
      Providence cannot be against you. So I feel. Mr. Parsley spoke very
      beautifully to that purpose last Sunday in the morning service. A little
      too much through his nose, perhaps; but the poor young man's nose is a
      great organ, and we will not cast it in his teeth more than nature has
      done. I said so to my diplomatist, who was amused. If you are sparklingly
      vulgar with the English, you are aristocratic. Oh! what principle we women
      require in the thorny walk of life. I can show you a letter when we meet
      that will astonish humdrum. Not so diplomatic as the writer thought! Mrs.
      Melville (sweet woman!) must continue to practise civility; for a woman
      who is a wife, my dear, in verity she lives in a glass house, and let her
      fling no stones. "Let him who is without sin." How beautiful that
      Christian sentiment! I hope I shall be pardoned, but it always seems to me
      that what we have to endure is infinitely worse than any other suffering,
      for you find no comfort for the children of T              s in Scripture,
      nor any defence of their dreadful position. Robbers, thieves, Magdalens!
      but, no! the unfortunate offspring of that class are not even mentioned:
      at least, in my most diligent perusal of the Scriptures, I never lighted
      upon any remote allusion; and we know the Jews did wear clothing.
      Outcasts, verily! And Evan could go, and write       but I have no
      patience with him. He is the blind tool of his mother, and anybody's
      puppet.'
    
    
      The letter concludes, with horrid emphasis:
    
    
      'The Madre in Beckley! Has sent for Evan from a low public-house! I have
      intercepted the messenger. Evan closeted with Sir Franks. Andrew's
      horrible old brother with Lady Jocelyn. The whole house, from garret to
      kitchen, full of whispers!'
    
    
      A prayer to Providence closes the communication.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XXVIII. TOM COGGLESEY'S PROPOSITION
    
    
      The appearance of a curricle and a donkey-cart within the gates of Beckley
      Court, produced a sensation among the men of the lower halls, and a couple
      of them rushed out, with the left calf considerably in advance, to defend
      the house from violation. Toward the curricle they directed what should
      have been a bow, but was a nod. Their joint attention was then given to
      the donkey-cart, in which old Tom Cogglesby sat alone, bunchy in figure,
      bunched in face, his shrewd grey eyes twinkling under the bush of his
      eyebrows.
    
    
      'Oy, sir       you! my man!' exclaimed the tallest of the pair,
      resolutely. 'This won't do. Don't you know driving this sort of conveyance
      slap along the gravel 'ere, up to the pillars, 's unparliamentary? Can't
      be allowed. Now, right about!'
    
    
      This address, accompanied by a commanding elevation of the dexter hand,
      seemed to excite Mr. Raikes far more than Old Tom. He alighted from his
      perch in haste, and was running up to the stalwart figure, crying,
      'Fellow!' when, as you tell a dog to lie down, Old Tom called out, 'Be
      quiet, Sir!' and Raikes halted with prompt military obedience.
    
    
      The sight of the curricle acting satellite to the donkey-cart staggered
      the two footmen.
    
    
      'Are you lords?' sang out Old Tom.
    
    
      A burst of laughter from the friends of Mr. Raikes, in the curricle,
      helped to make the powdered gentlemen aware of a sarcasm, and one with no
      little dignity replied that they were not lords.
    
    
      'Oh! Then come and hold my donkey.'
    
    
      Great irresolution was displayed at the injunction, but having consulted
      the face of Mr. Raikes, one fellow, evidently half overcome by what was
      put upon him, with the steps of Adam into exile, descended to the gravel,
      and laid his hand on the donkey's head.
    
    
      'Hold hard!' cried Old Tom. 'Whisper in his ear. He'll know your
      language.'
    
    
      'May I have the felicity of assisting you to terra firma?' interposed Mr.
      Raikes, with the bow of deferential familiarity.
    
    
      'Done that once too often,' returned Old Tom, jumping out. 'There. What's
      the fee? There's a crown for you that ain't afraid of a live donkey; and
      there 's a sixpenny bit for you that are       to keep up your courage;
      and when he's dead you shall have his skin       to shave by.'
    
    
      'Excellent!' shouted Raikes.
    
    
      'Thomas!' he addressed a footman, 'hand in my card. Mr. John Feversham
      Raikes.'
    
    
      'And tell my lady, Tom Cogglesby's come,' added the owner of that name.
    
    
      We will follow Tom Cogglesby, as he chooses to be called.
    
    
      Lady Jocelyn rose on his entering the library, and walking up to him,
      encountered him with a kindly full face.
    
    
      'So I see you at last, Tom?' she said, without releasing his hand; and Old
      Tom mounted patches of red in his wrinkled cheeks, and blinked, and
      betrayed a singular antiquated bashfulness, which ended, after a mumble of
      'Yes, there he was, and he hoped her ladyship was well,' by his seeking
      refuge in a chair, where he sat hard, and fixed his attention on the leg
      of a table.
    
    
      'Well, Tom, do you find much change in me?' she was woman enough to
      continue.
    
    
      He was obliged to look up.
    
    
      'Can't say I do, my lady.'
    
    
      'Don't you see the grey hairs, Tom?'
    
    
      'Better than a wig,' rejoined he.
    
    
      Was it true that her ladyship had behaved rather ill to Old Tom in her
      youth? Excellent women have been naughty girls, and young Beauties will
      have their train. It is also very possible that Old Tom had presumed upon
      trifles, and found it difficult to forgive her his own folly.
    
    
      'Preferable to a wig? Well, I would rather see you with your natural
      thatch. You're bent, too. You look as if you had kept away from Beckley a
      little too long.'
    
    
      'Told you, my lady, I should come when your daughter was marriageable.'
    
    
      'Oho! that's it? I thought it was the Election!
    
    
      'Election be                       hem!       beg pardon, my lady.'
    
    
      'Swear, Tom, if it relieves you. I think it bad to check an oath or a
      sneeze.'
    
    
      'I 'm come to see you on business, my lady, or I shouldn't have troubled
      you.'
    
    
      'Malice?'
    
    
      'You 'll see I don't bear any, my lady.'
    
    
      'Ah! if you had only sworn roundly twenty-five years ago, what a much
      younger man you would have been! and a brave capital old friend whom I
      should not have missed all that time.'
    
    
      'Come!' cried Old Tom, varying his eyes rapidly between her ladyship's
      face and the floor, 'you acknowledge I had reason to.'
    
    
      'Mais, cela va sans dire.'
    
    
      'Cobblers' sons ain't scholars, my lady.'
    
    
      'And are not all in the habit of throwing their fathers in our teeth, I
      hope!'
    
    
      Old Tom wriggled in his chair. 'Well, my lady, I'm not going to make a
      fool of myself at my time o' life. Needn't be alarmed now. You've got the
      bell-rope handy and a husband on the premises.'
    
    
      Lady Jocelyn smiled, stood up, and went to him. 'I like an honest fist,'
      she said, taking his. 'We 're not going to be doubtful friends, and we
      won't snap and snarl. That's for people who're independent of wigs, Tom. I
      find, for my part, that a little grey on the top of any head cools the
      temper amazingly. I used to be rather hot once.'
    
    
      'You could be peppery, my lady.'
    
    
      'Now I'm cool, Tom, and so must you be; or, if you fight, it must be in my
      cause, as you did when you thrashed that saucy young carter. Do you
      remember?'
    
    
      'If you'll sit ye down, my lady, I'll just tell you what I'm come for,'
      said Old Tom, who plainly showed that he did remember, and was alarmingly
      softened by her ladyship's retention of the incident.
    
    
      Lady Jocelyn returned to her place.
    
    
      'You've got a marriageable daughter, my lady?'
    
    
      'I suppose we may call her so,' said Lady Jocelyn, with a composed glance
      at the ceiling.
    
    
      ''Gaged to be married to any young chap?'
    
    
      'You must put the question to her, Tom.'
    
    
      'Ha! I don't want to see her.'
    
    
      At this Lady Jocelyn looked slightly relieved. Old Tom continued.
    
    
      'Happen to have got a little money       not so much as many a lord's got,
      I dare say; such as 'tis, there 'tis. Young fellow I know wants a wife,
      and he shall have best part of it. Will that suit ye, my lady?'
    
    
      Lady Jocelyn folded her hands. 'Certainly; I've no objection. What it has
      to do with me I can't perceive.'
    
    
      'Ahem!' went Old Tom. 'It won't hurt your daughter to be married now, will
      it?'
    
    
      'Oh! my daughter is the destined bride of your "young fellow,"' said Lady
      Jocelyn. 'Is that how it's to be?'
    
    
      'She'       Old Tom cleared his throat 'she won't marry a lord, my lady;
      but she       'hem       if she don't mind that       'll have a deuced
      sight more hard cash than many lord's son 'd give her, and a young fellow
      for a husband, sound in wind and limb, good bone and muscle, speaks
      grammar and two or three languages, and       '
    
    
      'Stop!' cried Lady Jocelyn. 'I hope this is not a prize young man? If he
      belongs, at his age, to the unco quid, I refuse to take him for a
      son-in-law, and I think Rose will, too.'
    
    
      Old Tom burst out vehemently: 'He's a damned good young fellow, though he
      isn't a lord.'
    
    
      'Well,' said Lady Jocelyn, 'I 've no doubt you're in earnest, Tom. It 's
      curious, for this morning Rose has come to me and given me the first
      chapter of a botheration, which she declares is to end in the common rash
      experiment. What is your "young fellow's" name? Who is he? What is he?'
    
    
      'Won't take my guarantee, my lady?'
    
    
      'Rose       if she marries       must have a name, you know?'
    
    
      Old Tom hit his knee. 'Then there's a pill for ye to swallow, for he ain't
      the son of a lord.'
    
    
      'That's swallowed, Tom. What is he?'
    
    
      'He's the son of a tradesman, then, my lady.' And Old Tom watched her to
      note the effect he had produced.
    
    
      'More 's the pity,' was all she remarked.
    
    
      'And he 'll have his thousand a year to start with; and he's a tailor, my
      lady.'
    
    
      Her ladyship opened her eyes.
    
    
      'Harrington's his name, my lady. Don't know whether you ever heard of it.'
    
    
      Lady Jocelyn flung herself back in her chair. 'The queerest thing I ever
      met!' said she.
    
    
      'Thousand a year to start with,' Old Tom went on, 'and if she marries       I
      mean if he marries her, I'll settle a thousand per ann. on the first
      baby-boy or gal.'
    
    
      'Hum! Is this gross collusion, Mr. Tom?' Lady Jocelyn inquired.
    
    
      'What does that mean?'
    
    
      'Have you spoken of this before to any one?'
    
    
      'I haven't, my lady. Decided on it this morning. Hem! you got a son, too.
      He's fond of a young gal, or he ought to be. I'll settle him when I've
      settled the daughter.'
    
    
      'Harry is strongly attached to a dozen, I believe,' said his mother.
      'Well, Tom, we'll think of it. I may as well tell you: Rose has just been
      here to inform me that this Mr. Harrington has turned her head, and that
      she has given her troth, and all that sort of thing. I believe such was
      not to be laid to my charge in my day.'
    
    
      'You were open enough, my lady,' said Old Tom. 'She's fond of the young
      fellow? She'll have a pill to swallow! poor young woman!'
    
    
      Old Tom visibly chuckled. Lady Jocelyn had a momentary temptation to lead
      him out, but she did not like the subject well enough to play with it.
    
    
      'Apparently Rose has swallowed it,' she said.
    
    
      'Goose, shears, cabbage, and all!' muttered Old Tom. 'Got a stomach!       she
      knows he's a tailor, then? The young fellow told her? He hasn't been
      playing the lord to her?'
    
    
      'As far as he's concerned, I think he has been tolerably honest, Tom, for
      a man and a lover.'
    
    
      'And told her he was born and bound a tailor?'
    
    
      'Rose certainly heard it from him.'
    
    
      Slapping his knee, Old Tom cried: 'Bravo!' For though one part of his
      nature was disappointed, and the best part of his plot disarranged, he
      liked Evan's proceeding and felt warm at what seemed to him Rose's scorn
      of rank.
    
    
      'She must be a good gal, my lady. She couldn't have got it from t' other
      side. Got it from you. Not that you       '
    
    
      'No,' said Lady Jocelyn, apprehending him. 'I'm afraid I have no
      Republican virtues. I 'm afraid I should have rejected the pill. Don't be
      angry with me,' for Old Tom looked sour again; 'I like birth and position,
      and worldly advantages, and, notwithstanding Rose's pledge of the
      instrument she calls her heart, and in spite of your offer, I shall, I
      tell you honestly, counsel her to have nothing to do with       '
    
    
      'Anything less than lords,' Old Tom struck in. 'Very well. Are you going
      to lock her up, my lady?'
    
    
      'No. Nor shall I whip her with rods.'
    
    
      'Leave her free to her choice?'
    
    
      'She will have my advice. That I shall give her. And I shall take care
      that before she makes a step she shall know exactly what it leads to. Her
      father, of course, will exercise his judgement.' (Lady Jocelyn said this
      to uphold the honour of Sir Franks, knowing at the same time perfectly
      well that he would be wheedled by Rose.) 'I confess I like this Mr.
      Harrington. But it's a great misfortune for him to have had a notorious
      father. A tailor should certainly avoid fame, and this young man will have
      to carry his father on his back. He 'll never throw the great Mel off.'
    
    
      Tom Cogglesby listened, and was really astonished at her ladyship's calm
      reception of his proposal.
    
    
      'Shameful of him! shameful!' he muttered perversely: for it would have
      made him desolate to have had to change his opinion of her ladyship after
      cherishing it, and consoling himself with it, five-and-twenty years.
      Fearing the approach of softness, he prepared to take his leave.
    
    
      'Now       your servant, my lady. I stick to my word, mind: and if your
      people here are willing, I       I 've got a candidate up for Fall'field       I'll
      knock him down, and you shall sneak in your Tory. Servant, my lady.'
    
    
      Old Tom rose to go. Lady Jocelyn took his hand cordially, though she could
      not help smiling at the humility of the cobbler's son in his manner of
      speaking of the Tory candidate.
    
    
      'Won't you stop with us a few days?'
    
    
      'I 'd rather not, I thank ye.'
    
    
      'Won't you see Rose?'
    
    
      'I won't. Not till she's married.'
    
    
      'Well, Tom, we're friends now?'
    
    
      'Not aware I've ever done you any harm, my lady.'
    
    
      'Look me in the face.'
    
    
      The trial was hard for him. Though she had been five-and-twenty years a
      wife, she was still very handsome: but he was not going to be melted, and
      when the perverse old fellow obeyed her, it was with an aspect of resolute
      disgust that would have made any other woman indignant. Lady Jocelyn
      laughed.
    
    
      'Why, Tom, your brother Andrew's here, and makes himself comfortable with
      us. We rode by Brook's farm the other day. Do you remember Copping's pond       how
      we dragged it that night? What days we had!'
    
    
      Old Tom tugged once or twice at his imprisoned fist, while these youthful
      frolics of his too stupid self and the wild and beautiful Miss Bonner were
      being recalled.
    
    
      'I remember!' he said savagely, and reaching the door hurled out: 'And I
      remember the Bull-dogs, too! servant, my lady.' With which he effected a
      retreat, to avoid a ringing laugh he heard in his ears.
    
    
      Lady Jocelyn had not laughed. She had done no more than look and smile
      kindly on the old boy. It was at the Bull-dogs, a fall of water on the
      borders of the park, that Tom Cogglesby, then a hearty young man, had been
      guilty of his folly: had mistaken her frank friendliness for a return of
      his passion, and his stubborn vanity still attributed her rejection of his
      suit to the fact of his descent from a cobbler, or, as he put it, to her
      infernal worship of rank.
    
    
      'Poor old Tom!' said her ladyship, when alone. 'He 's rough at the rind,
      but sound at the core.' She had no idea of the long revenge Old Tom
      cherished, and had just shaped into a plot to be equal with her for the
      Bull-dogs.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XXIX. PRELUDE TO AN ENGAGEMENT
    
    
      Money was a strong point with the Elburne brood. The Jocelyns very
      properly respected blood; but being, as Harry, their youngest
      representative, termed them, poor as rats, they were justified in
      considering it a marketable stuff; and when they married they married for
      money. The Hon. Miss Jocelyn had espoused a manufacturer, who failed in
      his contract, and deserved his death. The diplomatist, Melville, had not
      stepped aside from the family traditions in his alliance with Miss Black,
      the daughter of a bold bankrupt, educated in affluence; and if he touched
      nothing but L5000 and some very pretty ringlets, that was not his fault.
      Sir Franks, too, mixed his pure stream with gold. As yet, however, the
      gold had done little more than shine on him; and, belonging to expectancy,
      it might be thought unsubstantial. Beckley Court was in the hands of Mrs.
      Bonner, who, with the highest sense of duty toward her only living child,
      was the last to appreciate Lady Jocelyn's entire absence of demonstrative
      affection, and severely reprobated her daughter's philosophic handling of
      certain serious subjects. Sir Franks, no doubt, came better off than the
      others; her ladyship brought him twenty thousand pounds, and Harry had ten
      in the past tense, and Rose ten in the future; but living, as he had done,
      a score of years anticipating the demise of an incurable invalid, he,
      though an excellent husband and father, could scarcely be taught to
      imagine that the Jocelyn object of his bargain was attained. He had the
      semblance of wealth, without the personal glow which absolute possession
      brings. It was his habit to call himself a poor man, and it was his dream
      that Rose should marry a rich one. Harry was hopeless. He had been his
      Grandmother's pet up to the years of adolescence: he was getting too old
      for any prospect of a military career he had no turn for diplomacy, no
      taste for any of the walks open to blood and birth, and was in headlong
      disgrace with the fountain of goodness at Beckley Court, where he was
      still kept in the tacit understanding that, should Juliana inherit the
      place, he must be at hand to marry her instantly, after the fashion of the
      Jocelyns. They were an injured family; for what they gave was good, and
      the commercial world had not behaved honourably to them. Now, Ferdinand
      Laxley was just the match for Rose. Born to a title and fine estate, he
      was evidently fond of her, and there had been a gentle hope in the bosom
      of Sir Franks that the family fatality would cease, and that Rose would
      marry both money and blood.
    
    
      From this happy delusion poor Sir Franks was awakened to hear that his
      daughter had plighted herself to the son of a tradesman: that, as the
      climax to their evil fate, she who had some blood and some money of her
      own       the only Jocelyn who had ever united the two       was desirous
      of wasting herself on one who had neither. The idea was so utterly opposed
      to the principles Sir Franks had been trained in, that his intellect could
      not grasp it. He listened to his sister, Mrs. Shorne: he listened to his
      wife; he agreed with all they said, though what they said was widely
      diverse: he consented to see and speak to Evan, and he did so, and was
      much the most distressed. For Sir Franks liked many things in life, and
      hated one thing alone       which was 'bother.' A smooth world was his
      delight. Rose knew this, and her instruction to Evan was: 'You cannot give
      me up       you will go, but you cannot give me up while I am faithful to
      you: tell him that.' She knew that to impress this fact at once on the
      mind of Sir Franks would be a great gain; for in his detestation of bother
      he would soon grow reconciled to things monstrous: and hearing the same on
      both sides, the matter would assume an inevitable shape to him. Mr. Second
      Fiddle had no difficulty in declaring the eternity of his sentiments; but
      he toned them with a despair Rose did not contemplate, and added also his
      readiness to repair, in any way possible, the evil done. He spoke of his
      birth and position. Sir Franks, with a gentlemanly delicacy natural to all
      lovers of a smooth world, begged him to see the main and the
      insurmountable objection. Birth was to be desired, of course, and
      position, and so forth: but without money how can two young people marry?
      Evan's heart melted at this generous way of putting it. He said he saw it,
      he had no hope: he would go and be forgotten: and begged that for any
      annoyance his visit might have caused Sir Franks and Lady Jocelyn, they
      would pardon him. Sir Franks shook him by the hand, and the interview
      ended in a dialogue on the condition of the knees of Black Lymport, and on
      horseflesh in Portugal and Spain.
    
    
      Following Evan, Rose went to her father and gave him a good hour's
      excitement, after which the worthy gentleman hurried for consolation to
      Lady Jocelyn, whom he found reading a book of French memoirs, in her usual
      attitude, with her feet stretched out and her head thrown back, as in a
      distant survey of the lively people screening her from a troubled world.
      Her ladyship read him a piquant story, and Sir Franks capped it with
      another from memory; whereupon her ladyship held him wrong in one turn of
      the story, and Sir Franks rose to get the volume to verify, and while he
      was turning over the leaves, Lady Jocelyn told him incidentally of old Tom
      Cogglesby's visit and proposal. Sir Franks found the passage, and that her
      ladyship was right, which it did not move her countenance to hear.
    
    
      'Ah!' said he, finding it no use to pretend there was no bother in the
      world, 'here's a pretty pickle! Rose says she will have that fellow.'
    
    
      'Hum!' replied her ladyship. 'And if she keeps her mind a couple of years,
      it will be a wonder.'
    
    
      'Very bad for her this sort of thing       talked about,' muttered Sir
      Franks. 'Ferdinand was just the man.'
    
    
      'Well, yes; I suppose it's her mistake to think brains an absolute
      requisite,' said Lady Jocelyn, opening her book again, and scanning down a
      column.
    
    
      Sir Franks, being imitative, adopted a similar refuge, and the talk
      between them was varied by quotations and choice bits from the authors
      they had recourse to. Both leaned back in their chairs, and spoke with
      their eyes on their books.
    
    
      'Julia's going to write to her mother,' said he.
    
    
      'Very filial and proper,' said she.
    
    
      'There'll be a horrible hubbub, you know, Emily.'
    
    
      'Most probably. I shall get the blame; 'cela se concoit'.'
    
    
      'Young Harrington goes the day after to-morrow. Thought it better not to
      pack him off in a hurry.'
    
    
      'And just before the pic-nic; no, certainly. I suppose it would look odd.'
    
    
      'How are we to get rid of the Countess?'
    
    
      'Eh? This Bautru is amusing, Franks; but he's nothing to Vandy. 'Homme
      incomparable!' On the whole I find Menage rather dull. The Countess? what
      an accomplished liar that woman is! She seems to have stepped out of
      Tallemant's Gallery. Concerning the Countess, I suppose you had better
      apply to Melville.'
    
    
      'Where the deuce did this young Harrington get his breeding from?'
    
    
      'He comes of a notable sire.'
    
    
      'Yes, but there's no sign of the snob in him.'
    
    
      'And I exonerate him from the charge of "adventuring" after Rose. George
      Uplift tells me       I had him in just now       that the mother is a
      woman of mark and strong principle. She has probably corrected the too
      luxuriant nature of Mel in her offspring. That is to say in this one.
      'Pour les autres, je ne dis pas'. Well, the young man will go; and if Rose
      chooses to become a monument of constancy, we can do nothing. I shall give
      my advice; but as she has not deceived me, and she is a reasonable being,
      I shan't interfere. Putting the case at the worst, they will not want
      money. I have no doubt Tom Cogglesby means what he says, and will do it.
      So there we will leave the matter till we hear from Elburne House.'
    
    
      Sir Franks groaned at the thought.
    
    
      'How much does he offer to settle on them?' he asked.
    
    
      'A thousand a year on the marriage, and the same amount to the first
      child. I daresay the end would be that they would get all.'
    
    
      Sir Franks nodded, and remained with one eye-brow pitiably elevated above
      the level of the other.
    
    
      'Anything but a tailor!' he exclaimed presently, half to himself.
    
    
      'There is a prejudice against that craft,' her ladyship acquiesced.
      'Beranger       let me see       your favourite Frenchman, Franks, wasn't
      it his father?       no, his grandfather. "Mon pauvre et humble
      grand-pyre," I think, was a tailor. Hum! the degrees of the thing, I
      confess, don't affect me. One trade I imagine to be no worse than
      another.'
    
    
      'Ferdinand's allowance is about a thousand,' said Sir Franks,
      meditatively.
    
    
      'And won't be a farthing more till he comes to the title,' added her
      ladyship.
    
    
      'Well,' resumed Sir Franks, 'it's a horrible bother!'
    
    
      His wife philosophically agreed with him, and the subject was dropped.
    
    
      Lady Jocelyn felt with her husband, more than she chose to let him know,
      and Sir Franks could have burst into anathemas against fate and
      circumstances, more than his love of a smooth world permitted. He,
      however, was subdued by her calmness; and she, with ten times the weight
      of brain, was manoeuvred by the wonderful dash of General Rose Jocelyn.
      For her ladyship, thinking, 'I shall get the blame of all this,' rather
      sided insensibly with the offenders against those who condemned them
      jointly; and seeing that Rose had been scrupulously honest and
      straightforward in a very delicate matter, this lady was so constituted
      that she could not but applaud her daughter in her heart. A worldly woman
      would have acted, if she had not thought, differently; but her ladyship
      was not a worldly woman.
    
    
      Evan's bearing and character had, during his residence at Beckley Court,
      become so thoroughly accepted as those of a gentleman, and one of their
      own rank, that, after an allusion to the origin of his breeding, not a
      word more was said by either of them on that topic. Besides, Rose had
      dignified him by her decided conduct.
    
    
      By the time poor Sir Franks had read himself into tranquillity, Mrs.
      Shorne, who knew him well, and was determined that he should not enter
      upon his usual negociations with an unpleasantness: that is to say, to
      forget it, joined them in the library, bringing with her Sir John Loring
      and Hamilton Jocelyn. Her first measure was to compel Sir Franks to put
      down his book. Lady Jocelyn subsequently had to do the same.
    
    
      'Well, what have you done, Franks?' said Mrs. Shorne.
    
    
      'Done?' answered the poor gentleman. 'What is there to be done? I've
      spoken to young Harrington.'
    
    
      'Spoken to him! He deserves horsewhipping! Have you not told him to quit
      the house instantly?'
    
    
      Lady Jocelyn came to her husband's aid: 'It wouldn't do, I think, to kick
      him out. In the first place, he hasn't deserved it.'
    
    
      'Not deserved it, Emily!       the commonest, low, vile, adventuring
      tradesman!'
    
    
      'In the second place,' pursued her ladyship, 'it's not adviseable to do
      anything that will make Rose enter into the young woman's sublimities. It
      's better not to let a lunatic see that you think him stark mad, and the
      same holds with young women afflicted with the love-mania. The sound of
      sense, even if they can't understand it, flatters them so as to keep them
      within bounds. Otherwise you drive them into excesses best avoided.'
    
    
      'Really, Emily,' said Mrs. Shorne, 'you speak almost, one would say, as an
      advocate of such unions.'
    
    
      'You must know perfectly well that I entirely condemn them,' replied her
      ladyship, who had once, and once only, delivered her opinion of the
      nuptials of Mr. and Mrs. Shorne.
    
    
      In self-defence, and to show the total difference between the cases, Mrs.
      Shorne interjected: 'An utterly penniless young adventurer!'
    
    
      'Oh, no; there's money,' remarked Sir Franks.
    
    
      'Money is there?' quoth Hamilton, respectfully.
    
    
      'And there's wit,' added Sir John, 'if he has half his sister's talent.'
    
    
      'Astonishing woman!' Hamilton chimed in; adding, with a shrug, 'But,
      egad!'
    
    
      'Well, we don't want him to resemble his sister,' said Lady Jocelyn. 'I
      acknowledge she's amusing.'
    
    
      'Amusing, Emily!' Mrs. Shorne never encountered her sister-in-law's
      calmness without indignation. 'I could not rest in the house with such a
      person, knowing her what she is. A vile adventuress, as I firmly believe.
      What does she do all day with your mother? Depend upon it, you will repent
      her visit in more ways than one.'
    
    
      'A prophecy?' asked Lady Jocelyn, smiling.
    
    
      On the grounds of common sense, on the grounds of propriety, and
      consideration of what was due to themselves, all agreed to condemn the
      notion of Rose casting herself away on Evan. Lady Jocelyn agreed with Mrs.
      Shorne; Sir Franks with his brother, and Sir John. But as to what they
      were to do, they were divided. Lady Jocelyn said she should not prevent
      Rose from writing to Evan, if she had the wish to do so.
    
    
      'Folly must come out,' said her ladyship. 'It's a combustible material. I
      won't have her health injured. She shall go into the world more. She will
      be presented at Court, and if it's necessary to give her a dose or two to
      counteract her vanity, I don't object. This will wear off, or, 'si c'est
      veritablement une grande passion, eh bien' we must take what Providence
      sends us.'
    
    
      'And which we might have prevented if we had condescended to listen to the
      plainest worldly wisdom,' added Mrs. Shorne.
    
    
      'Yes,' said Lady Jocelyn, equably, 'you know, you and I, Julia, argue from
      two distinct points. Girls may be shut up, as you propose. I don't think
      nature intended to have them the obverse of men. I 'm sure their mothers
      never designed that they should run away with footmen, riding-masters,
      chance curates, as they occasionally do, and wouldn't if they had points
      of comparison. My opinion is that Prospero was just saved by the Prince of
      Naples being wrecked on his island, from a shocking mis-alliance between
      his daughter and the son of Sycorax. I see it clearly. Poetry conceals the
      extreme probability, but from what I know of my sex, I should have no
      hesitation in turning prophet also, as to that.'
    
    
      What could Mrs. Shorne do with a mother who talked in this manner? Mrs.
      Melville, when she arrived to take part in the conference, which gradually
      swelled to a family one, was equally unable to make Lady Jocelyn perceive
      that her plan of bringing up Rose was, in the present result of it, other
      than unlucky.
    
    
      Now the two Generals       Rose Jocelyn and the Countess de Saldar       had
      brought matters to this pass; and from the two tactical extremes: the
      former by openness and dash; the latter by subtlety, and her own
      interpretations of the means extended to her by Providence. I will not be
      so bold as to state which of the two I think right. Good and evil work
      together in this world. If the Countess had not woven the tangle, and
      gained Evan time, Rose would never have seen his blood,       never have
      had her spirit hurried out of all shows and forms and habits of thought,
      up to the gates of existence, as it were, where she took him simply as God
      created him and her, and clave to him. Again, had Rose been secret, when
      this turn in her nature came, she would have forfeited the strange power
      she received from it, and which endowed her with decision to say what was
      in her heart, and stamp it lastingly there. The two Generals were quite
      antagonistic, but no two, in perfect ignorance of one another's
      proceedings, ever worked so harmoniously toward the main result. The
      Countess was the skilful engineer: Rose the General of cavalry. And it did
      really seem that, with Tom Cogglesby and his thousands in reserve, the
      victory was about to be gained. The male Jocelyns, an easy race, decided
      that, if the worst came to the worst, and Rose proved a wonder, there was
      money, which was something.
    
    
      But social prejudice was about to claim its champion. Hitherto there had
      been no General on the opposite side. Love, aided by the Countess, had
      engaged an inert mass. The champion was discovered in the person of the
      provincial Don Juan, Mr. Harry Jocelyn. Harry had gone on a mysterious
      business of his own to London. He returned with a green box under his arm,
      which, five minutes after his arrival, was entrusted to Conning, in
      company with a genial present for herself, of a kind not perhaps so fit
      for exhibition; at least they both thought so, for it was given in the
      shades. Harry then went to pay his respects to his mother, who received
      him with her customary ironical tolerance. His father, to whom he was an
      incarnation of bother, likewise nodded to him and gave him a finger. Duty
      done, Harry looked round him for pleasure, and observed nothing but glum
      faces. Even the face of John Raikes was, heavy. He had been hovering about
      the Duke and Miss Current for an hour, hoping the Countess would come and
      give him a promised introduction. The Countess stirred not from above, and
      Jack drifted from group to group on the lawn, and grew conscious that
      wherever he went he brought silence with him. His isolation made him
      humble, and when Harry shook his hand, and said he remembered Fallow field
      and the fun there, Mr. Raikes thanked him.
    
    
      Harry made his way to join his friend Ferdinand, and furnished him with
      the latest London news not likely to appear in the papers. Laxley was
      distant and unamused. From the fact, too, that Harry was known to be the
      Countess's slave, his presence produced the same effect in the different
      circles about the grounds, as did that of John Raikes. Harry began to yawn
      and wish very ardently for his sweet lady. She, however, had too fine an
      instinct to descend.
    
    
      An hour before dinner, Juliana sent him a message that she desired to see
      him.
    
    
      'Jove! I hope that girl's not going to be blowing hot again,' sighed the
      conqueror.
    
    
      He had nothing to fear from Juliana. The moment they were alone she asked
      him, 'Have you heard of it?'
    
    
      Harry shook his head and shrugged.
    
    
      'They haven't told you? Rose has engaged herself to Mr. Harrington, a
      tradesman, a tailor!'
    
    
      'Pooh! have you got hold of that story?' said Harry. 'But I'm sorry for
      old Ferdy. He was fond of Rosey. Here's another bother!'
    
    
      'You don't believe me, Harry?'
    
    
      Harry was mentally debating whether, in this new posture of affairs, his
      friend Ferdinand would press his claim for certain moneys lent.
    
    
      'Oh, I believe you,' he said. 'Harrington has the knack with you women.
      Why, you made eyes at him. It was a toss-up between you and Rosey once.'
    
    
      Juliana let this accusation pass.
    
    
      'He is a tradesman. He has a shop in Lymport, I tell you, Harry, and his
      name on it. And he came here on purpose to catch Rose. And now he has
      caught her, he tells her. And his mother is now at one of the village
      inns, waiting to see him. Go to Mr. George Uplift; he knows the family.
      Yes, the Countess has turned your head, of course; but she has schemed,
      and schemed, and told such stories       God forgive her!'
    
    
      The girl had to veil her eyes in a spasm of angry weeping.
    
    
      'Oh, come! Juley!' murmured her killing cousin. Harry boasted an
      extraordinary weakness at the sight of feminine tears. 'I say! Juley! you
      know if you begin crying I'm done for, and it isn't fair.'
    
    
      He dropped his arm on her waist to console her, and generously declared to
      her that he always had been, very fond of her. These scenes were not
      foreign to the youth. Her fits of crying, from which she would burst in a
      frenzy of contempt at him, had made Harry say stronger things; and the
      assurances of profound affection uttered in a most languid voice will
      sting the hearts of women.
    
    
      Harry still went on with his declarations, heating them rapidly, so as to
      bring on himself the usual outburst and check. She was longer in coming to
      it this time, and he had a horrid fear, that instead of dismissing him
      fiercely, and so annulling his words, the strange little person was going
      to be soft and hold him to them. There were her tears, however, which she
      could not stop.
    
    
      'Well, then, Juley, look. I do, upon my honour, yes       there, don't cry
      any more       I do love you.'
    
    
      Harry held his breath in awful suspense. Juliana quietly disengaged her
      waist, and looking at him, said, 'Poor Harry! You need not lie any more to
      please me.'
    
    
      Such was Harry's astonishment, that he exclaimed,
    
    
      'It isn't a lie! I say, I do love you.' And for an instant he thought and
      hoped that he did love her.
    
    
      'Well, then, Harry, I don't love you,' said Juliana; which revealed to our
      friend that he had been mistaken in his own emotions. Nevertheless, his
      vanity was hurt when he saw she was sincere, and he listened to her, a
      moody being. This may account for his excessive wrath at Evan Harrington
      after Juliana had given him proofs of the truth of what she said.
    
    
      But the Countess was Harrington's sister! The image of the Countess swam
      before him. Was it possible? Harry went about asking everybody he met. The
      initiated were discreet; those who had the whispers were open. A bare
      truth is not so convincing as one that discretion confirms. Harry found
      the detestable news perfectly true.
    
    
      'Stop it by all means if you can,' said his father.
    
    
      'Yes, try a fall with Rose,' said his mother.
    
    
      'And I must sit down to dinner to-day with a confounded fellow, the son of
      a tailor, who's had the impudence to make love to my sister!' cried Harry.
      'I'm determined to kick him out of the house!       half.'
    
    
      'To what is the modification of your determination due?' Lady Jocelyn
      inquired, probably suspecting the sweet and gracious person who divided
      Harry's mind.
    
    
      Her ladyship treated her children as she did mankind generally, from her
      intellectual eminence. Harry was compelled to fly from her cruel shafts.
      He found comfort with his Aunt Shorne, and she as much as told Harry that
      he was the head of the house, and must take up the matter summarily. It
      was expected of him. Now was the time for him to show his manhood.
    
    
      Harry could think of but one way to do that.
    
    
      'Yes, and if I do       all up with the old lady,' he said, and had to
      explain that his Grandmama Bonner would never leave a penny to a fellow
      who had fought a duel.
    
    
      'A duel!' said Mrs. Shorne. 'No, there are other ways. Insist upon his
      renouncing her. And Rose       treat her with a high hand, as becomes you.
      Your mother is incorrigible, and as for your father, one knows him of old.
      This devolves upon you. Our family honour is in your hands, Harry.'
    
    
      Considering Harry's reputation, the family honour must have got low:
      Harry, of course, was not disposed to think so. He discovered a great deal
      of unused pride within him, for which he had hitherto not found an
      agreeable vent. He vowed to his aunt that he would not suffer the
      disgrace, and while still that blandishing olive-hued visage swam before
      his eyes, he pledged his word to Mrs. Shorne that he would come to an
      understanding with Harrington that night.
    
    
      'Quietly,' said she. 'No scandal, pray.'
    
    
      'Oh, never mind how I do it,' returned Harry, manfully. 'How am I to do
      it, then?' he added, suddenly remembering his debt to Evan.
    
    
      Mrs. Shorne instructed him how to do it quietly, and without fear of
      scandal. The miserable champion replied that it was very well for her to
      tell him to say this and that, but       and she thought him demented       he
      must, previous to addressing Harrington in those terms, have money.
    
    
      'Money!' echoed the lady. 'Money!'
    
    
      'Yes, money!' he iterated doggedly, and she learnt that he had borrowed a
      sum of Harrington, and the amount of the sum.
    
    
      It was a disastrous plight, for Mrs. Shorne was penniless.
    
    
      She cited Ferdinand Laxley as a likely lender.
    
    
      'Oh, I'm deep with him already,' said Harry, in apparent dejection.
    
    
      'How dreadful are these everlasting borrowings of yours!' exclaimed his
      aunt, unaware of a trifling incongruity in her sentiments. 'You must speak
      to him without       pay him by-and-by. We must scrape the money together.
      I will write to your grandfather.'
    
    
      'Yes; speak to him! How can I when I owe him? I can't tell a fellow he's a
      blackguard when I owe him, and I can't speak any other way. I ain't a
      diplomatist. Dashed if I know what to do!'
    
    
      'Juliana,' murmured his aunt.
    
    
      'Can't ask her, you know.'
    
    
      Mrs. Shorne combated the one prominent reason for the objection: but there
      were two. Harry believed that he had exhausted Juliana's treasury.
      Reproaching him further for his wastefulness, Mrs. Shorne promised him the
      money should be got, by hook or by crook, next day.
    
    
      'And you will speak to this Mr. Harrington to-night, Harry? No allusion to
      the loan till you return it. Appeal to his sense of honour.'
    
    
      The dinner-bell assembled the inmates of the house. Evan was not among
      them. He had gone, as the Countess said aloud, on a diplomatic mission to
      Fallow field, with Andrew Cogglesby. The truth being that he had finally
      taken Andrew into his confidence concerning the letter, the annuity, and
      the bond. Upon which occasion Andrew had burst into a laugh, and said he
      could lay his hand on the writer of the letter.
    
    
      'Trust Old Tom for plots, Van! He'll blow you up in a twinkling, the
      cunning old dog! He pretends to be hard       he 's as soft as I am, if it
      wasn't for his crotchets. We'll hand him back the cash, and that's ended.
      And       eh? what a dear girl she is! Not that I'm astonished. My Harry
      might have married a lord       sit at top of any table in the land! And
      you're as good as any man.
    
    
      That's my opinion. But I say she's a wonderful girl to see it.'
    
    
      Chattering thus, Andrew drove with the dear boy into Fallow field. Evan
      was still in his dream. To him the generous love and valiant openness of
      Rose, though they were matched in his own bosom, seemed scarcely human.
      Almost as noble to him were the gentlemanly plainspeaking of Sir Franks
      and Lady Jocelyn's kind commonsense. But the more he esteemed them, the
      more unbounded and miraculous appeared the prospect of his calling their
      daughter by the sacred name, and kneeling with her at their feet. Did the
      dear heavens have that in store for him? The horizon edges were dimly
      lighted.
    
    
      Harry looked about under his eye-lids for Evan, trying at the same time to
      compose himself for the martyrdom he had to endure in sitting at table
      with the presumptuous fellow. The Countess signalled him to come within
      the presence. As he was crossing the room, Rose entered, and moved to meet
      him, with: 'Ah, Harry! back again! Glad to see you.'
    
    
      Harry gave her a blunt nod, to which she was inattentive.
    
    
      'What!' whispered the Countess, after he pressed the tips of her fingers.
      'Have you brought back the grocer?'
    
    
      Now this was hard to stand. Harry could forgive her her birth, and pass it
      utterly by if she chose to fall in love with him; but to hear the grocer
      mentioned, when he knew of the tailor, was a little too much, and what
      Harry felt his ingenuous countenance was accustomed to exhibit. The
      Countess saw it. She turned her head from him to the diplomatist, and he
      had to remain like a sentinel at her feet. He did not want to be thanked
      for the green box: still he thought she might have favoured him with one
      of her much-embracing smiles:
    
    
      In the evening, after wine, when he was warm, and had almost forgotten the
      insult to his family and himself, the Countess snubbed him. It was unwise
      on her part, but she had the ghastly thought that facts were oozing out,
      and were already half known. She was therefore sensitive tenfold to
      appearances; savage if one failed to keep up her lie to her, and was
      guilty of a shadow of difference of behaviour. The pic-nic over, our
      General would evacuate Beckley Court, and shake the dust off her shoes,
      and leave the harvest of what she had sown to Providence. Till then,
      respect, and the honours of war! So the Countess snubbed him, and he being
      full of wine, fell into the hands of Juliana, who had witnessed the little
      scene.
    
    
      'She has made a fool of others as well as of you,' said Juliana.
    
    
      'How has she?' he inquired.
    
    
      'Never mind. Do you want to make her humble and crouch to you?'
    
    
      'I want to see Harrington,' said Harry.
    
    
      'He will not return to-night from Fallow field. He has gone there to get
      Mr. Andrew Cogglesby's brother to do something for him. You won't have
      such another chance of humbling them both       both! I told you his
      mother is at an inn here. The Countess has sent Mr. Harrington to Fallow
      field to be out of the way, and she has told her mother all sorts of
      falsehoods.'
    
    
      'How do you know all that?' quoth Harry. 'By Jove, Juley! talk about
      plotters! No keeping anything from you, ever!'
    
    
      'Never mind. The mother is here. She must be a vulgar woman. Oh! if you
      could manage, Harry, to get this woman to come       you could do it so
      easily! while they are at the pie-nic tomorrow. It would have the best
      effect on Rose. She would then understand! And the Countess!'
    
    
      'I could send the old woman a message!' cried Harry, rushing into the
      scheme, inspired by Juliana's fiery eyes. 'Send her a sort of message to
      say where we all were.'
    
    
      'Let her know that her son is here, in some way,' Juley resumed.
    
    
      'And, egad! what an explosion!' pursued Harry. 'But, suppose       '
    
    
      'No one shall know, if you leave it to me-if you do just as I tell you,
      Harry. You won't be treated as you were this evening after that, if you
      bring down her pride. And, Harry, I hear you want money       I can give
      you some.'
    
    
      'You're a perfect trump, Juley!' exclaimed her enthusiastic cousin.
    
    
      'But, no; I can't take it. I must kiss you, though.'
    
    
      He put a kiss upon her cheek. Once his kisses had left a red waxen stamp;
      she was callous to these compliments now.
    
    
      'Will you do what I advise you to-morrow?' she asked.
    
    
      After a slight hesitation, during which the olive-hued visage flitted
      faintly in the distances of his brain, Harry said:
    
    
      'It 'll do Rose good, and make Harrington cut. Yes! I declare I will.'
    
    
      Then they parted. Juliana went to her bed-room, and flung herself upon the
      bed hysterically. As the tears came thick and fast, she jumped up to lock
      the door, for this outrageous habit of crying had made her contemptible in
      the eyes of Lady Jocelyn, and an object of pity to Rose. Some excellent
      and noble natures cannot tolerate disease, and are mystified by its
      ebullitions. It was very sad to see the slight thin frame grasped by those
      wan hands to contain the violence of the frenzy that possessed her! the
      pale, hapless face rigid above the torment in her bosom! She had prayed to
      be loved like other girls, and her readiness to give her heart in return
      had made her a by-word in the house. She went to the window and leaned out
      on the casement, looking towards Fallowfield over the downs, weeping
      bitterly, with a hard shut mouth. One brilliant star hung above the ridge,
      and danced on her tears.
    
    
      'Will he forgive me?' she murmured. 'Oh, my God! I wish we were dead
      together!'
    
    
      Her weeping ceased, and she closed the window, and undressed as far away
      from the mirror as she could get; but its force was too much for her, and
      drew her to it. Some undefined hope had sprung in her suddenly. With
      nervous slow steps she approached the glass, and first brushing back the
      masses of black hair from her brow, looked as for some new revelation.
      Long and anxiously she perused her features: the wide bony forehead; the
      eyes deep-set and rounded with the scarlet of recent tears, the thin
      nose-sharp as the dead; the weak irritable mouth and sunken cheeks. She
      gazed like a spirit disconnected from what she saw. Presently a sort of
      forlorn negative was indicated by the motion of her head.
    
    
      'I can pardon him,' she said, and sighed. 'How could he love such a face!'
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XXX. THE BATTLE OF THE BULL-DOGS. PART I.
    
    
      At the South-western extremity of the park, with a view extending over
      wide meadows and troubled mill waters, yellow barn-roofs and weather-gray
      old farm-walls, two grassy mounds threw their slopes to the margin of the
      stream. Here the bull-dogs held revel. The hollow between the slopes was
      crowned by a bending birch, which rose three-stemmed from the root, and
      hung a noiseless green shower over the basin of green it shadowed. Beneath
      it the interminable growl sounded pleasantly; softly shot the sparkle of
      the twisting water, and you might dream things half-fulfilled. Knots of
      fern were about, but the tops of the mounds were firm grass, evidently
      well rolled, and with an eye to airy feet. Olympus one eminence was
      called, Parnassus the other. Olympus a little overlooked Parnassus, but
      Parnassus was broader and altogether better adapted for the games of the
      Muses. Round the edges of both there was a well-trimmed bush of laurel,
      obscuring only the feet of the dancers from the observing gods. For on
      Olympus the elders reclined. Great efforts had occasionally been made to
      dispossess and unseat them, and their security depended mainly on a hump
      in the middle of the mound which defied the dance.
    
    
      Watteau-like groups were already couched in the shade. There were ladies
      of all sorts: town-bred and country-bred: farmers' daughters and daughters
      of peers: for this pic-nic, as Lady Jocelyn, disgusting the Countess,
      would call it, was in reality a 'fete champetre', given annually, to which
      the fair offspring of the superior tenants were invited the brothers and
      fathers coming to fetch them in the evening. It struck the eye of the
      Countess de Saldar that Olympus would be a fitting throne for her, and a
      point whence her shafts might fly without fear of a return. Like another
      illustrious General at Salamanca, she directed a detachment to take
      possession of the height. Courtly Sir John Loring ran up at once, and gave
      the diplomatist an opportunity to thank her flatteringly for gaining them
      two minutes to themselves. Sir John waved his handkerchief in triumph,
      welcoming them under an awning where carpets and cushions were spread, and
      whence the Countess could eye the field. She was dressed ravishingly;
      slightly in a foreign style, the bodice being peaked at the waist, as was
      then the Portuguese persuasion. The neck, too, was deliciously veiled with
      fine lace       and thoroughly veiled, for it was a feature the Countess
      did not care to expose to the vulgar daylight. Off her gentle shoulders,
      as it were some fringe of cloud blown by the breeze this sweet lady opened
      her bosom to, curled a lovely black lace scarf: not Caroline's. If she
      laughed, the tinge of mourning lent her laughter new charms. If she
      sighed, the exuberant array of her apparel bade the spectator be of good
      cheer. Was she witty, men surrendered reason and adored her. Only when she
      entered the majestic mood, and assumed the languors of greatness, and
      recited musky anecdotes of her intimacy with it, only then did mankind, as
      represented at Beckley Court, open an internal eye and reflect that it was
      wonderful in a tailor's daughter. And she felt that mankind did so
      reflect. Her instincts did not deceive her. She knew not how much was
      known; in the depths of her heart she kept low the fear that possibly all
      might be known; and succeeding in this, she said to herself that probably
      nothing was known after all. George Uplift, Miss Carrington, and Rose,
      were the three she abhorred. Partly to be out of their way, and to be out
      of the way of chance shots (for she had heard names of people coming that
      reminded her of Dubbins's, where, in past days, there had been on one
      awful occasion a terrific discovery made), the Countess selected Olympus
      for her station. It was her last day, and she determined to be happy.
      Doubtless, she was making a retreat, but have not illustrious Generals
      snatched victory from their pursuers? Fair, then, sweet, and full of
      grace, the Countess moved. As the restless shifting of colours to her
      motions was the constant interchange of her semisorrowful manner and ready
      archness. Sir John almost capered to please her, and the diplomatist in
      talking to her forgot his diplomacy and the craft of his tongue.
    
    
      It was the last day also of Caroline and the Duke. The Countess clung to
      Caroline and the Duke more than to Evan and Rose. She could see the first
      couple walking under an avenue of limes, and near them that young man or
      monkey, Raikes, as if in ambush. Twice they passed him, and twice he
      doffed his hat and did homage.
    
    
      'A most singular creature!' exclaimed the Countess. 'It is my constant
      marvel where my brother discovered such a curiosity. Do notice him.'
    
    
      'That man? Raikes?' said the diplomatist. 'Do you know he is our rival?
      Harry wanted an excuse for another bottle last night, and proposed the
      "Member" for Fallowfield. Up got this Mr. Raikes and returned thanks.'
    
    
      'Yes?' the Countess negligently interjected in a way she had caught from
      Lady Jocelyn.
    
    
      'Cogglesby's nominee, apparently.'
    
    
      'I know it all,' said the Countess. 'We need have no apprehension. He is
      docile. My brother-in-law's brother, you see, is most eccentric. We can
      manage him best through this Mr. Raikes, for a personal application would
      be ruin. He quite detests our family, and indeed all the aristocracy.'
    
    
      Melville's mouth pursed, and he looked very grave.
    
    
      Sir John remarked: 'He seems like a monkey just turned into a man.'
    
    
      'And doubtful about the tail,' added the Countess.
    
    
      The image was tolerably correct, but other causes were at the bottom of
      the air worn by John Raikes. The Countess had obtained an invitation for
      him, with instructions that he should come early, and he had followed them
      so implicitly that the curricle was flinging dust on the hedges between
      Fallow field and Beckley but an hour or two after the chariot of Apollo
      had mounted the heavens, and Mr. Raikes presented himself at the breakfast
      table. Fortunately for him the Countess was there. After the repast she
      introduced him to the Duke: and he bowed to the Duke, and the Duke bowed
      to him: and now, to instance the peculiar justness in the mind of Mr.
      Raikes, he, though he worshipped a coronet and would gladly have recalled
      the feudal times to a corrupt land, could not help thinking that his bow
      had beaten the Duke's and was better. He would rather not have thought so,
      for it upset his preconceptions and threatened a revolution in his ideas.
      For this reason he followed the Duke, and tried, if possible, to correct,
      or at least chasten the impressions he had of possessing a glaring
      advantage over the nobleman. The Duke's second notice of him was hardly a
      nod. 'Well!' Mr. Raikes reflected, 'if this is your Duke, why, egad! for
      figure and style my friend Harrington beats him hollow.' And Raikes
      thought he knew who could conduct a conversation with superior dignity and
      neatness. The torchlight of a delusion was extinguished in him, but he did
      not wander long in that gloomy cavernous darkness of the disenchanted, as
      many of us do, and as Evan had done, when after a week at Beckley Court he
      began to examine of what stuff his brilliant father, the great Mel, was
      composed. On the contrary, as the light of the Duke dwindled, Raikes
      gained in lustre. 'In fact,' he said, 'there's nothing but the title
      wanting.' He was by this time on a level with the Duke in his elastic
      mind.
    
    
      Olympus had been held in possession by the Countess about half an hour,
      when Lady Jocelyn mounted it, quite unconscious that she was scaling a
      fortified point. The Countess herself fired off the first gun at her.
    
    
      'It has been so extremely delightful up alone here, Lady Jocelyn: to look
      at everybody below! I hope many will not intrude on us!'
    
    
      'None but the dowagers who have breath to get up,' replied her ladyship,
      panting. 'By the way, Countess, you hardly belong to us yet. You dance?'
    
    
      'Indeed, I do not.'
    
    
      'Oh, then you are in your right place. A dowager is a woman who doesn't
      dance: and her male attendant is       what is he? We will call him a
      fogy.'
    
    
      Lady Jocelyn directed a smile at Melville and Sir John, who both protested
      that it was an honour to be the Countess's fogy.
    
    
      Rose now joined them, with Laxley morally dragged in her wake.
    
    
      'Another dowager and fogy!' cried the Countess, musically. 'Do you not
      dance, my child?'
    
    
      'Not till the music strikes up,' rejoined Rose. 'I suppose we shall have
      to eat first.'
    
    
      'That is the Hamlet of the pic-nic play, I believe,' said her mother.
    
    
      'Of course you dance, don't you, Countess?' Rose inquired, for the sake of
      amiable conversation.
    
    
      The Countess's head signified: 'Oh, no! quite out of the question': she
      held up a little bit of her mournful draperies, adding: 'Besides, you,
      dear child, know your company, and can select; I do not, and cannot do so.
      I understand we have a most varied assembly!'
    
    
      Rose shut her eyes, and then looked at her mother. Lady Jocelyn's face was
      undisturbed; but while her eyes were still upon the Countess, she drew her
      head gently back, imperceptibly. If anything, she was admiring the lady;
      but Rose could be no placid philosophic spectator of what was to her a
      horrible assumption and hypocrisy. For the sake of him she loved, she had
      swallowed a nauseous cup bravely. The Countess was too much for her. She
      felt sick to think of being allied to this person. She had a shuddering
      desire to run into the ranks of the world, and hide her head from
      multitudinous hootings. With a pang of envy she saw her friend Jenny
      walking by the side of William Harvey, happy, untried, unoffending: full
      of hope, and without any bitter draughts to swallow!
    
    
      Aunt Bel now came tripping up gaily.
    
    
      'Take the alternative, 'douairiere or demoiselle'?' cried Lady Jocelyn.
      'We must have a sharp distinction, or Olympus will be mobbed.'
    
    
      'Entre les deux, s'il vous plait,' responded Aunt Bel. 'Rose, hurry down,
      and leaven the mass. I see ten girls in a bunch. It's shocking. Ferdinand,
      pray disperse yourself. Why is it, Emily, that we are always in excess at
      pic-nics? Is man dying out?'
    
    
      'From what I can see,' remarked Lady Jocelyn, 'Harry will be lost to his
      species unless some one quickly relieves him. He's already half eaten up
      by the Conley girls. Countess, isn't it your duty to rescue him?'
    
    
      The Countess bowed, and murmured to Sir John:
    
    
      'A dismissal!'
    
    
      'I fear my fascinations, Lady Jocelyn, may not compete with those fresh
      young persons.'
    
    
      'Ha! ha! "fresh young persons,"' laughed Sir John for the ladies in
      question were romping boisterously with Mr. Harry.
    
    
      The Countess inquired for the names and condition of the ladies, and was
      told that they sprang from Farmer Conley, a well-to-do son of the soil,
      who farmed about a couple of thousand acres between Fallow field and
      Beckley, and bore a good reputation at the county bank.
    
    
      'But I do think,' observed the Countess, 'it must indeed be pernicious for
      any youth to associate with that class of woman. A deterioration of
      manners!'
    
    
      Rose looked at her mother again. She thought 'Those girls would scorn to
      marry a tradesman's son!'
    
    
      The feeling grew in Rose that the Countess lowered and degraded her. Her
      mother's calm contemplation of the lady was more distressing than if she
      had expressed the contempt Rose was certain, according to her young ideas,
      Lady Jocelyn must hold.
    
    
      Now the Countess had been considering that she would like to have a word
      or two with Mr. Harry, and kissing her fingers to the occupants of
      Olympus, and fixing her fancy on the diverse thoughts of the ladies and
      gentlemen, deduced from a rapturous or critical contemplation of her
      figure from behind, she descended the slope.
    
    
      Was it going to be a happy day? The well-imagined opinions of the
      gentleman on her attire and style, made her lean to the affirmative; but
      Rose's demure behaviour, and something       something would come across
      her hopes. She had, as she now said to herself, stopped for the pic-nic,
      mainly to give Caroline a last opportunity of binding the Duke to visit
      the Cogglesby saloons in London. Let Caroline cleverly contrive this, as
      she might, without any compromise, and the stay at Beckley Court would be
      a great gain. Yes, Caroline was still with the Duke; they were talking
      earnestly. The Countess breathed a short appeal to Providence that
      Caroline might not prove a fool. Overnight she had said to Caroline: 'Do
      not be so English. Can one not enjoy friendship with a nobleman without
      wounding one's conscience or breaking with the world? My dear, the Duke
      visiting you, you cow that infamous Strike of yours. He will be utterly
      obsequious! I am not telling you to pass the line. The contrary. But we
      continentals have our grievous reputation because we dare to meet as
      intellectual beings, and defy the imputation that ladies and gentlemen are
      no better than animals.'
    
    
      It sounded very lofty to Caroline, who, accepting its sincerity, replied:
    
    
      'I cannot do things by halves. I cannot live a life of deceit. A life of
      misery       not deceit.'
    
    
      Whereupon, pitying her poor English nature, the Countess gave her advice,
      and this advice she now implored her familiars to instruct or compel
      Caroline to follow.
    
    
      The Countess's garment was plucked at. She beheld little Dorothy Loring
      glancing up at her with the roguish timidity of her years.
    
    
      'May I come with you?' asked the little maid, and went off into a prattle:
      'I spent that five shillings       I bought a shilling's worth of sweet
      stuff, and nine penn'orth of twine, and a shilling for small wax candles
      to light in my room when I'm going to bed, because I like plenty of light
      by the looking-glass always, and they do make the room so hot! My Jane
      declared she almost fainted, but I burnt them out! Then I only had very
      little left for a horse to mount my doll on; and I wasn't going to get a
      screw, so I went to Papa, and he gave me five shillings. And, oh, do you
      know, Rose can't bear me to be with you. Jealousy, I suppose, for you're
      very agreeable. And, do you know, your Mama is coming to-day? I've got a
      Papa and no Mama, and you've got a Mama and no Papa. Isn't it funny? But I
      don't think so much of it, as you 're grown up. Oh, I'm quite sure she is
      coming, because I heard Harry telling Juley she was, and Juley said it
      would be so gratifying to you.'
    
    
      A bribe and a message relieved the Countess of Dorothy's attendance on
      her.
    
    
      What did this mean? Were people so base as to be guilty of hideous plots
      in this house? Her mother coming! The Countess's blood turned deadly
      chill. Had it been her father she would not have feared, but her mother
      was so vilely plain of speech; she never opened her mouth save to deliver
      facts: which was to the Countess the sign of atrocious vulgarity.
    
    
      But her mother had written to say she would wait for Evan in Fallow field!
      The Countess grasped at straws. Did Dorothy hear that? And if Harry and
      Juliana spoke of her mother, what did that mean? That she was hunted, and
      must stand at bay!
    
    
      'Oh, Papa! Papa! why did you marry a Dawley?' she exclaimed, plunging to
      what was, in her idea, the root of the evil.
    
    
      She had no time for outcries and lamentations. It dawned on her that this
      was to be a day of battle. Where was Harry? Still in the midst of the
      Conley throng, apparently pooh-poohing something, to judge by the twist of
      his mouth.
    
    
      The Countess delicately signed for him to approach her. The extreme
      delicacy of the signal was at least an excuse for Harry to perceive
      nothing. It was renewed, and Harry burst into a fit of laughter at some
      fun of one of the Conley girls. The Countess passed on, and met Juliana
      pacing by herself near the lower gates of the park. She wished only to see
      how Juliana behaved. The girl looked perfectly trustful, as much so as
      when the Countess was pouring in her ears the tales of Evan's growing but
      bashful affection for her.
    
    
      'He will soon be here,' whispered the Countess. 'Has he told you he will
      come by this entrance?'
    
    
      'No,' replied Juliana.
    
    
      'You do not look well, sweet child.'
    
    
      'I was thinking that you did not, Countess?'
    
    
      'Oh, indeed, yes! With reason, alas! All our visitors have by this time
      arrived, I presume?'
    
    
      'They come all day.'
    
    
      The Countess hastened away from one who, when roused, could be almost as
      clever as herself, and again stood in meditation near the joyful Harry.
      This time she did not signal so discreetly. Harry could not but see it,
      and the Conley girls accused him of cruelty to the beautiful dame, which
      novel idea stung Harry with delight, and he held out to indulge in it a
      little longer. His back was half turned, and as he talked noisily, he
      could not observe the serene and resolute march of the Countess toward
      him. The youth gaped when he found his arm taken prisoner by the insertion
      of a small deliciously-gloved and perfumed hand through it. 'I must claim
      you for a few moments,' said the Countess, and took the startled Conley
      girls one and all in her beautiful smile of excuse.
    
    
      'Why do you compromise me thus, sir?'
    
    
      These astounding words were spoken out of the hearing of the Conley girls.
    
    
      'Compromise you!' muttered Harry.
    
    
      Masterly was the skill with which the Countess contrived to speak angrily
      and as an injured woman, while she wore an indifferent social countenance.
    
    
      'I repeat, compromise me. No, Mr. Harry Jocelyn, you are not the
      jackanapes you try to make people think you: you understand me.'
    
    
      The Countess might accuse him, but Harry never had the ambition to make
      people think him that: his natural tendency was the reverse: and he
      objected to the application of the word jackanapes to himself, and was
      ready to contest the fact of people having that opinion at all. However,
      all he did was to repeat: 'Compromise!'
    
    
      'Is not open unkindness to me compromising me?'
    
    
      'How?' asked Harry.
    
    
      'Would you dare to do it to a strange lady? Would you have the impudence
      to attempt it with any woman here but me? No, I am innocent; it is my
      consolation; I have resisted you, but you by this cowardly behaviour place
      me       and my reputation, which is more       at your mercy. Noble
      behaviour, Mr. Harry Jocelyn! I shall remember my young English
      gentleman.'
    
    
      The view was totally new to Harry.
    
    
      'I really had no idea of compromising you,' he said. 'Upon my honour, I
      can't see how I did it now!'
    
    
      'Oblige me by walking less in the neighbourhood of those fat-faced glaring
      farm-girls,' the Countess spoke under her breath; 'and don't look as if
      you were being whipped. The art of it is evident       you are but
      carrying on the game.       Listen. If you permit yourself to exhibit an
      unkindness to me, you show to any man who is a judge, and to every woman,
      that there has been something between us. You know my innocence       yes!
      but you must punish me for having resisted you thus long.'
    
    
      Harry swore he never had such an idea, and was much too much of a man and
      a gentleman to behave in that way.       And yet it seemed wonderfully
      clever! And here was the Countess saying:
    
    
      'Take your reward, Mr. Harry Jocelyn. You have succeeded; I am your humble
      slave. I come to you and sue for peace. To save my reputation I endanger
      myself. This is generous of you.'
    
    
      'Am I such a clever fellow?' thought the young gentleman. 'Deuced lucky
      with women': he knew that: still a fellow must be wonderfully,
      miraculously, clever to be able to twist and spin about such a woman as
      this in that way. He did not object to conceive that he was the fellow to
      do it. Besides, here was the Countess de Saldar-worth five hundred of the
      Conley girls       almost at his feet!
    
    
      Mollified, he said: 'Now, didn't you begin it?'
    
    
      'Evasion!' was the answer. 'It would be such pleasure to you so see a
      proud woman weep! And if yesterday, persecuted as I am, with dreadful
      falsehoods abroad respecting me and mine, if yesterday I did seem cold to
      your great merits, is it generous of you to take this revenge?'
    
    
      Harry began to scent the double meaning in her words. She gave him no time
      to grow cool over it. She leaned, half abandoned, on his arm. Arts
      feminine and irresistible encompassed him. It was a fatal mistake of
      Juliana's to enlist Harry Jocelyn against the Countess de Saldar. He
      engaged, still without any direct allusion to the real business, to move
      heaven and earth to undo all that he had done, and the Countess implied an
      engagement to do       what? more than she intended to fulfil.
    
    
      Ten minutes later she was alone with Caroline.
    
    
      'Tie yourself to the Duke at the dinner,' she said, in the forcible phrase
      she could use when necessary. 'Don't let them scheme to separate you.
      Never mind looks       do it!'
    
    
      Caroline, however, had her reasons for desiring to maintain appearances.
      The Countess dashed at her hesitation.
    
    
      'There is a plot to humiliate us in the most abominable way. The whole
      family have sworn to make us blush publicly. Publicly blush! They have
      written to Mama to come and speak out. Now will you attend to me,
      Caroline? You do not credit such atrocity? I know it to be true.'
    
    
      'I never can believe that Rose would do such a thing,' said Caroline.' We
      can hardly have to endure more than has befallen us already.'
    
    
      Her speech was pensive, as of one who had matter of her own to ponder
      over. A swift illumination burst in the Countess's mind.
    
    
      'No? Have you, dear, darling Carry? not that I intend that you should! but
      to-day the Duke would be such ineffable support to us. May I deem you have
      not been too cruel to-day? You dear silly English creature, "Duck," I used
      to call you when I was your little Louy. All is not yet lost, but I will
      save you from the ignominy if I can. I will!'
    
    
      Caroline denied nothing       confirmed nothing, just as the Countess had
      stated nothing. Yet they understood one another perfectly. Women have a
      subtler language than ours: the veil pertains to them morally as bodily,
      and they see clearer through it.
    
    
      The Countess had no time to lose. Wrath was in her heart. She did not lend
      all her thoughts to self-defence.
    
    
      Without phrasing a word, or absolutely shaping a thought in her head, she
      slanted across the sun to Mr. Raikes, who had taken refreshment, and in
      obedience to his instinct, notwithstanding his enormous pretensions, had
      commenced a few preliminary antics.
    
    
      'Dear Mr. Raikes!' she said, drawing him aside, 'not before dinner!'
    
    
      'I really can't contain the exuberant flow!' returned that gentleman. 'My
      animal spirits always get the better of me,' he added confidentially.
    
    
      'Suppose you devote your animal spirits to my service for half an hour.'
    
    
      'Yours, Countess, from the 'os frontis' to the chine!' was the exuberant
      rejoinder.
    
    
      The Countess made a wry mouth.
    
    
      'Your curricle is in Beckley?'
    
    
      'Behold!' said Jack. 'Two juveniles, not half so blest as I, do from the
      seat regard the festive scene o'er yon park palings. They are there, even
      Franko and Fred. I 'm afraid I promised to get them in at a later period
      of the day. Which sadly sore my conscience doth disturb! But what is to be
      done about the curricle, my Countess?'
    
    
      'Mr. Raikes,' said the Countess, smiling on him fixedly, 'you are amusing;
      but in addressing me, you must be precise, and above all things accurate.
      I am not your Countess!'
    
    
      He bowed profoundly. 'Oh, that I might say my Queen!'
    
    
      The Countess replied: 'A conviction of your lunacy would prevent my taking
      offence, though I might wish you enclosed and guarded.'
    
    
      Without any further exclamations, Raikes acknowledged a superior.
    
    
      'And, now, attend to me,' said the Countess. 'Listen:
    
    
      You go yourself, or send your friends instantly to Fallow field. Bring
      with you that girl and her child. Stop: there is such a person. Tell her
      she is to be spoken to about the prospects of the poor infant. I leave
      that to your inventive genius. Evan wishes her here. Bring her, and should
      you see the mad captain who behaves so oddly, favour him with a ride. He
      says he dreams his wife is here, and he will not reveal his name! Suppose
      it should be my own beloved husband! I am quite anxious.'
    
    
      The Countess saw him go up to the palings and hold a communication with
      his friends Franko and Fred. One took the whip, and after mutual
      flourishes, drove away.
    
    
      'Now!' mused the Countess, 'if Captain Evremonde should come!' It would
      break up the pic-nic. Alas! the Countess had surrendered her humble hopes
      of a day's pleasure. But if her mother came as well, what a diversion that
      would be! If her mother came before the Captain, his arrival would cover
      the retreat; if the Captain preceded her, she would not be noticed.
      Suppose her mother refrained from coming? In that case it was a pity, but
      the Jocelyns had brought it on themselves.
    
    
      This mapping out of consequences followed the Countess's deeds, and did
      not inspire them. Her passions sharpened her instincts, which produced her
      actions. The reflections ensued: as in nature, the consequences were all
      seen subsequently! Observe the difference between your male and female
      Generals.
    
    
      On reflection, too, the Countess praised herself for having done all that
      could be done. She might have written to her mother: but her absence would
      have been remarked: her messenger might have been overhauled and, lastly,
      Mrs. Mel       'Gorgon of a mother!' the Countess cried out: for Mrs. Mel
      was like a Fate to her. She could remember only two occasions in her whole
      life when she had been able to manage her mother, and then by lying in
      such a way as to distress her conscience severely.
    
    
      'If Mama has conceived this idea of coming, nothing will impede her. My
      prayers will infuriate her!' said the Countess, and she was sure that she
      had acted both rightly and with wisdom.
    
    
      She put on her armour of smiles: she plunged into the thick of the enemy.
      Since they would not allow her to taste human happiness       she had
      asked but for the pic-nic! a small truce! since they denied her that,
      rather than let them triumph by seeing her wretched, she took into her
      bosom the joy of demons. She lured Mr. George Uplift away from Miss
      Carrington, and spoke to him strange hints of matrimonial disappointments,
      looking from time to time at that apprehensive lady, doating on her
      terrors. And Mr. George seconded her by his clouded face, for he was
      ashamed not to show that he did not know Louisa Harrington in the Countess
      de Saldar, and had not the courage to declare that he did. The Countess
      spoke familiarly, but without any hint of an ancient acquaintance between
      them. 'What a post her husband's got!' thought Mr. George, not envying the
      Count. He was wrong: she was an admirable ally. All over the field the
      Countess went, watching for her mother, praying that if she did come,
      Providence might prevent her from coming while they were at dinner. How
      clearly Mrs. Shorne and Mrs. Melville saw her vulgarity now! By the new
      light of knowledge, how certain they were that they had seen her ungentle
      training in a dozen little instances.
    
    
      'She is not well-bred, 'cela se voit',' said Lady Jocelyn.
    
    
      'Bred! it's the stage! How could such a person be bred?' said Mrs. Shorne.
    
    
      Accept in the Countess the heroine who is combating class-prejudices, and
      surely she is pre-eminently noteworthy. True, she fights only for her
      family, and is virtually the champion of the opposing institution
      misplaced. That does not matter: the Fates may have done it purposely: by
      conquering she establishes a principle. A Duke adores her sister, the
      daughter of the house her brother, and for herself she has many
      protestations in honour of her charms: nor are they empty ones. She can
      confound Mrs. Melville, if she pleases to, by exposing an adorer to lose a
      friend. Issuing out of Tailordom, she, a Countess, has done all this; and
      it were enough to make her glow, did not little evils, and angers, and
      spites, and alarms so frightfully beset her.
    
    
      The sun of the pic-nic system is dinner. Hence philosophers may deduce
      that the pic-nic is a British invention. There is no doubt that we do not
      shine at the pic-nic until we reflect the face of dinner. To this, then,
      all who were not lovers began seriously to look forward, and the advance
      of an excellent county band, specially hired to play during the
      entertainment, gave many of the guests quite a new taste for sweet music;
      and indeed we all enjoy a thing infinitely more when we see its meaning.
    
    
      About this time Evan entered the lower park-gates with Andrew. The first
      object he encountered was John Raikes in a state of great depression. He
      explained his case:
    
    
      'Just look at my frill! Now, upon my honour, you know, I'm good-tempered;
      I pass their bucolic habits, but this is beyond bearing. I was near the
      palings there, and a fellow calls out, "Hi! will you help the lady over?"
      Holloa! thinks I, an adventure! However, I advised him to take her round
      to the gates. The beast burst out laughing. "Now, then," says he, and I
      heard a scrambling at the pales, and up came the head of a dog. "Oh! the
      dog first," says I. "Catch by the ears," says he. I did so. "Pull," says
      he. "'Gad, pull indeed!", The beast gave a spring and came slap on my
      chest, with his dirty wet muzzle on my neck! I felt instantly it was the
      death of my frill, but gallant as you know me, I still asked for the lady.
      "If you will please, or an it meet your favour, to extend your hand to
      me!" I confess I did think it rather odd, the idea of a lady coming in
      that way over the palings! but my curst love of adventure always blinds
      me. It always misleads my better sense, Harrington. Well, instead of a
      lady, I see a fellow       he may have been a lineal descendant of Cedric
      the Saxon. "Where's the lady?" says I. "Lady?" says he, and stares, and
      then laughs: "Lady! why," he jumps over, and points at his beast of a dog,
      "don't you know a bitch when you see one?" I was in the most ferocious
      rage! If he hadn't been a big burly bully, down he'd have gone. "Why
      didn't you say what it was?" I roared. "Why," says he, "the word isn't
      considered polite!" I gave him a cut there. I said, "I rejoice to be
      positively assured that you uphold the laws and forms of civilization,
      sir." My belief is he didn't feel it.'
    
    
      'The thrust sinned in its shrewdness,' remarked Evan, ending a laugh.
    
    
      'Hem!' went Mr. Raikes, more contentedly: 'after all, what are appearances
      to the man of wit and intellect? Dress, and women will approve you: but I
      assure you they much prefer the man of wit in his slouched hat and
      stockings down. I was introduced to the Duke this morning. It is a curious
      thing that the seduction of a Duchess has always been one of my dreams.'
    
    
      At this Andrew Cogglesby fell into a fit of laughter.
    
    
      'Your servant,' said Mr. Raikes, turning to him. And then he muttered
      'Extraordinary likeness! Good Heavens! Powers!'
    
    
      From a state of depression, Mr. Raikes       changed into one of
      bewilderment. Evan paid no attention to him, and answered none of his
      hasty undertoned questions. Just then, as they were on the skirts of the
      company, the band struck up a lively tune, and quite unconsciously, the
      legs of Raikes, affected, it may be, by supernatural reminiscences,
      loosely hornpiped. It was but a moment: he remembered himself the next:
      but in that fatal moment eyes were on him. He never recovered his dignity
      in Beckley Court: he was fatally mercurial.
    
    
      'What is the joke against this poor fellow?' asked Evan of Andrew.
    
    
      'Never mind, Van. You'll roar. Old Tom again. We 'll see by-and-by, after
      the champagne. He       this young Raikes-ha! ha!       but I can't tell
      you.' And Andrew went away to Drummond, to whom he was more communicative.
      Then he went to Melville, and one or two others, and the eyes of many
      became concentrated on Raikes, and it was observed as a singular sign that
      he was constantly facing about, and flushing the fiercest red. Once he
      made an effort to get hold of Evan's arm and drag him away, as one who had
      an urgent confession to be delivered of, but Evan was talking to Lady
      Jocelyn, and other ladies, and quietly disengaged his arm without even
      turning to notice the face of his friend. Then the dinner was announced,
      and men saw the dinner. The Countess went to shake her brother's hand, and
      with a very gratulatory visage, said through her half-shut teeth.
    
    
      'If Mama appears, rise up and go away with her, before she has time to
      speak a word.' An instant after Evan found himself seated between Mrs.
      Evremonde and one of the Conley girls. The dinner had commenced. The first
      half of the Battle of the Bull-dogs was as peaceful as any ordinary
      pic-nic, and promised to the general company as calm a conclusion.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XXXI. THE BATTLE OF THE BULL-DOGS. PART II.
    
    
      If it be a distinct point of wisdom to hug the hour that is, then does
      dinner amount to a highly intellectual invitation to man, for it furnishes
      the occasion; and Britons are the wisest of their race, for more than all
      others they take advantage of it. In this Nature is undoubtedly our guide,
      seeing that he who, while feasting his body allows to his soul a thought
      for the morrow, is in his digestion curst, and becomes a house of evil
      humours. Now, though the epicure may complain of the cold meats, a
      dazzling table, a buzzing company, blue sky, and a band of music, are
      incentives to the forgetfulness of troubles past and imminent, and produce
      a concentration of the faculties. They may not exactly prove that peace is
      established between yourself and those who object to your carving of the
      world, but they testify to an armistice.
    
    
      Aided by these observations, you will understand how it was that the
      Countess de Saldar, afflicted and menaced, was inspired, on taking her
      seat, to give so graceful and stately a sweep to her dress that she was
      enabled to conceive woman and man alike to be secretly overcome by it. You
      will not refuse to credit the fact that Mr. Raikes threw care to the dogs,
      heavy as was that mysterious lump suddenly precipitated on his bosom; and
      you will think it not impossible that even the springers of the mine about
      to explode should lose their subterranean countenances. A generous
      abandonment to one idea prevailed. As for Evan, the first glass of
      champagne rushed into reckless nuptials with the music in his head,
      bringing Rose, warm almost as life, on his heart. Sublime are the visions
      of lovers! He knew he must leave her on the morrow; he feared he might
      never behold her again; and yet he tasted bliss, for it seemed within the
      contemplation of the Gods that he should dance with his darling before
      dark-haply waltz with her! Oh, heaven! he shuts his eyes, blinded. The
      band wheels off meltingly in a tune all cadences, and twirls, and risings
      and sinkings, and passionate outbursts trippingly consoled. Ah! how sweet
      to waltz through life with the right partner. And what a singular thing it
      is to look back on the day when we thought something like it! Never mind:
      there may be spheres where it is so managed       doubtless the planets
      have their Hanwell and Bedlam.
    
    
      I confess that the hand here writing is not insensible to the effects of
      that first glass of champagne. The poetry of our Countess's achievements
      waxes rich in manifold colours: I see her by the light of her own pleas to
      Providence. I doubt almost if the hand be mine which dared to make a hero
      play second fiddle, and to his beloved. I have placed a bushel over his
      light, certainly. Poor boy! it was enough that he should have tailordom on
      his shoulders: I ought to have allowed him to conquer Nature, and so come
      out of his eclipse. This shall be said of him: that he can play second
      fiddle without looking foolish, which, for my part, I call a greater
      triumph than if he were performing the heroics we are more accustomed to.
      He has steady eyes, can gaze at the right level into the eyes of others,
      and commands a tongue which is neither struck dumb nor set in a flutter by
      any startling question. The best instances to be given that he does not
      lack merit are that the Jocelyns, whom he has offended by his birth,
      cannot change their treatment of him, and that the hostile women, whatever
      they may say, do not think Rose utterly insane. At any rate, Rose is
      satisfied, and her self-love makes her a keen critic. The moment Evan
      appeared, the sickness produced in her by the Countess passed, and she was
      ready to brave her situation. With no mock humility she permitted Mrs.
      Shorne to place her in a seat where glances could not be interchanged. She
      was quite composed, calmly prepared for conversation with any one. Indeed,
      her behaviour since the hour of general explanation had been so perfectly
      well-contained, that Mrs. Melville said to Lady Jocelyn:
    
    
      'I am only thinking of the damage to her. It will pass over       this
      fancy. You can see she is not serious. It is mere spirit of opposition.
      She eats and drinks just like other girls. You can see that the fancy has
      not taken such very strong hold of her.'
    
    
      'I can't agree with you,' replied her ladyship. 'I would rather have her
      sit and sigh by the hour, and loathe roast beef. That would look nearer a
      cure.'
    
    
      'She has the notions of a silly country girl,' said Mrs. Shorne.
    
    
      'Exactly,' Lady Jocelyn replied. 'A season in London will give her
      balance.'
    
    
      So the guests were tolerably happy, or at least, with scarce an exception,
      open to the influences of champagne and music. Perhaps Juliana was the
      wretchedest creature present. She was about to smite on both cheeks him
      she loved, as well as the woman she despised and had been foiled by. Still
      she had the consolation that Rose, seeing the vulgar mother, might turn
      from Evan: a poor distant hope, meagre and shapeless like herself. Her
      most anxious thoughts concerned the means of getting money to lockup
      Harry's tongue. She could bear to meet the Countess's wrath, but not
      Evan's offended look. Hark to that Countess!
    
    
      'Why do you denominate this a pic-nic, Lady Jocelyn? It is in verity a
      fete!'
    
    
      'I suppose we ought to lie down 'A la Grecque' to come within the term,'
      was the reply. 'On the whole, I prefer plain English for such matters.'
    
    
      'But this is assuredly too sumptuous for a pic-nic, Lady Jocelyn. From
      what I can remember, pic-nic implies contribution from all the guests. It
      is true I left England a child!'
    
    
      Mr. George Uplift could not withhold a sharp grimace: The Countess had
      throttled the inward monitor that tells us when we are lying, so
      grievously had she practised the habit in the service of her family.
    
    
      'Yes,' said Mrs. Melville, 'I have heard of that fashion, and very stupid
      it is.'
    
    
      'Extremely vulgar,' murmured Miss Carrington.
    
    
      'Possibly,' Lady Jocelyn observed; 'but good fun. I have been to pic-nics,
      in my day. I invariably took cold pie and claret. I clashed with
      half-a-dozen, but all the harm we did was to upset the dictum that there
      can be too much of a good thing. I know for certain that the bottles were
      left empty.'
    
    
      'And this woman,' thought the Countess, 'this woman, with a soul so
      essentially vulgar, claims rank above me!' The reflection generated
      contempt of English society, in the first place, and then a passionate
      desire for self-assertion.
    
    
      She was startled by a direct attack which aroused her momentarily lulled
      energies.
    
    
      A lady, quite a stranger, a dry simpering lady, caught the Countess's
      benevolent passing gaze, and leaning forward, said: 'I hope her ladyship
      bears her affliction as well as can be expected?'
    
    
      In military parlance, the Countess was taken in flank. Another would have
      asked       What ladyship? To whom do you allude, may I beg to inquire?
      The Countess knew better. Rapid as light it shot through her that the
      relict of Sir Abraham was meant, and this she divined because she was
      aware that devilish malignity was watching to trip her.
    
    
      A little conversation happening to buzz at the instant, the Countess
      merely turned her chin to an angle, agitated her brows very gently, and
      crowned the performance with a mournful smile. All that a woman must feel
      at the demise of so precious a thing as a husband, was therein eloquently
      expressed: and at the same time, if explanations ensued, there were
      numerous ladyships in the world, whom the Countess did not mind
      afflicting, should she be hard pressed.
    
    
      'I knew him so well!' resumed the horrid woman, addressing anybody. 'It
      was so sad! so unexpected! but he was so subject to affection of the
      throat. And I was so sorry I could not get down to him in time. I had not
      seen him since his marriage, when I was a girl!       and to meet one of
      his children!       But, my dear, in quinsey, I have heard that there is
      nothing on earth like a good hearty laugh.'
    
    
      Mr. Raikes hearing this, sucked down the flavour of a glass of champagne,
      and with a look of fierce jollity, interposed, as if specially charged by
      Providence to make plain to the persecuted Countess his mission and
      business there: 'Then our vocation is at last revealed to us!
      Quinsey-doctor! I remember when a boy, wandering over the paternal
      mansion, and envying the life of a tinker, which my mother did not think a
      good omen in me. But the traps of a Quinsey-doctor are even lighter. Say
      twenty good jokes, and two or three of a practical kind. A man most
      enviable!'
    
    
      'It appears,' he remarked aloud to one of the Conley girls, 'that quinsey
      is needed before a joke is properly appreciated.'
    
    
      'I like fun,' said she, but had not apparently discovered it.
    
    
      What did that odious woman mean by perpetually talking about Sir Abraham?
      The Countess intercepted a glance between her and the hated Juliana. She
      felt it was a malignant conspiracy: still the vacuous vulgar air of the
      woman told her that most probably she was but an instrument, not a
      confederate, and was only trying to push herself into acquaintance with
      the great: a proceeding scorned and abominated by the Countess, who longed
      to punish her for her insolent presumption. The bitterness of her
      situation stung her tenfold when she considered that she dared not.
    
    
      Meantime the champagne became as regular in its flow as the Bull-dogs, and
      the monotonous bass of these latter sounded through the music, like life
      behind the murmur of pleasure, if you will. The Countess had a not
      unfeminine weakness for champagne, and old Mr. Bonner's cellar was well
      and choicely stocked. But was this enjoyment to the Countess?       this
      dreary station in the background! 'May I emerge?' she as much as implored
      Providence.
    
    
      The petition was infinitely tender. She thought she might, or it may be
      that nature was strong, and she could not restrain herself.
    
    
      Taking wine with Sir John, she said:
    
    
      'This bowing! Do you know how amusing it is deemed by us Portuguese? Why
      not embrace? as the dear Queen used to say to me.'
    
    
      'I am decidedly of Her Majesty's opinion,' observed Sir John, with
      emphasis, and the Countess drew back into a mingled laugh and blush.
    
    
      Her fiendish persecutor gave two or three nods. 'And you know the Queen!'
      she said.
    
    
      She had to repeat the remark: whereupon the Countess murmured,
      'Intimately.'
    
    
      'Ah, we have lost a staunch old Tory in Sir Abraham,' said the lady,
      performing lamentation.
    
    
      What did it mean? Could design lodge in that empty-looking head with its
      crisp curls, button nose, and diminishing simper? Was this pic-nic to be
      made as terrible to the Countess by her putative father as the dinner had
      been by the great Mel? The deep, hard, level look of Juliana met the
      Countess's smile from time to time, and like flimsy light horse before a
      solid array of infantry, the Countess fell back, only to be worried afresh
      by her perfectly unwitting tormentor.
    
    
      'His last days?       without pain? Oh, I hope so!' came after a lapse of
      general talk.
    
    
      'Aren't we getting a little funereal, Mrs. Perkins?' Lady Jocelyn asked,
      and then rallied her neighbours.
    
    
      Miss Carrington looked at her vexedly, for the fiendish Perkins was
      checked, and the Countess in alarm, about to commit herself, was a
      pleasant sight to Miss Carrington.
    
    
      'The worst of these indiscriminate meetings is that there is no
      conversation,' whispered the Countess, thanking Providence for the relief.
    
    
      Just then she saw Juliana bend her brows at another person. This was
      George Uplift, who shook his head, and indicated a shrewd-eyed, thin,
      middle-aged man, of a lawyer-like cast; and then Juliana nodded, and
      George Uplift touched his arm, and glanced hurriedly behind for champagne.
      The Countess's eyes dwelt on the timid young squire most affectionately.
      You never saw a fortress more unprepared for dread assault.
    
    
      'Hem!' was heard, terrific. But the proper pause had evidently not yet
      come, and now to prevent it the Countess strained her energies and tasked
      her genius intensely. Have you an idea of the difficulty of keeping up the
      ball among a host of ill-assorted, stupid country people, who have no open
      topics, and can talk of nothing continuously but scandal of their
      neighbours, and who, moreover, feel they are not up to the people they are
      mixing with? Darting upon Seymour Jocelyn, the Countess asked touchingly
      for news of the partridges. It was like the unlocking of a machine.
      Seymour was not blythe in his reply, but he was loud and forcible; and
      when he came to the statistics       oh, then you would have admired the
      Countess!       for comparisons ensued, braces were enumerated, numbers
      given were contested, and the shooting of this one jeered at, and
      another's sure mark respectfully admitted. And how lay the coveys? And
      what about the damage done by last winter's floods? And was there good
      hope of the pheasants? Outside this latter the Countess hovered. Twice the
      awful 'Hem!' was heard. She fought on. She kept them at it. If it flagged
      she wished to know this or that, and finally thought that, really, she
      should like herself to try one shot. The women had previously been left
      behind. This brought in the women. Lady Jocelyn proposed a female
      expedition for the morrow.
    
    
      'I believe I used to be something of a shot, formerly,' she said.
    
    
      'You peppered old Tom once, my lady,' remarked Andrew, and her ladyship
      laughed, and that foolish Andrew told the story, and the Countess, to
      revive her subject, had to say: 'May I be enrolled to shoot?' though she
      detested and shrank from fire-arms.
    
    
      'Here are two!' said the hearty presiding dame. 'Ladies, apply immediately
      to have your names put down.'
    
    
      The possibility of an expedition of ladies now struck Seymour vividly, and
      said he: 'I 'll be secretary'; and began applying to the ladies for
      permission to put down their names. Many declined, with brevity,
      muttering, either aloud or to themselves, 'unwomanly'; varied by
      'unladylike': some confessed cowardice; some a horror of the noise close
      to their ears; and there was the plea of nerves. But the names of
      half-a-dozen ladies were collected, and then followed much laughter, and
      musical hubbub, and delicate banter. So the ladies and gentlemen fell one
      and all into the partridge pit dug for them by the Countess: and that
      horrible 'Hem!' equal in force and terror to the roar of artillery
      preceding the charge of ten thousand dragoons, was silenced       the pit
      appeared impassable. Did the Countess crow over her advantage? Mark her:
      the lady's face is entirely given up to partridges. 'English sports are so
      much envied abroad,' she says: but what she dreads is a reflection, for
      that leads off from the point. A portion of her mind she keeps to combat
      them in Lady Jocelyn and others who have the tendency: the rest she
      divides between internal-prayers for succour, and casting about for
      another popular subject to follow partridges. Now, mere talent, as critics
      say when they are lighting candles round a genius, mere talent would have
      hit upon pheasants as the natural sequitur, and then diverged to sports       a
      great theme, for it ensures a chorus of sneers at foreigners, and so on
      probably to a discussion of birds and beasts best adapted to enrapture the
      palate of man. Stories may succeed, but they are doubtful, and not to be
      trusted, coming after cookery. After an exciting subject which has made
      the general tongue to wag, and just enough heated the brain to cause it to
      cry out for spiced food       then start your story: taking care that it
      be mild; for one too marvellous stops the tide, the sense of climax being
      strongly implanted in all bosoms. So the Countess told an anecdote       one
      of Mel's. Mr. George Uplift was quite familiar with it, and knew of one
      passage that would have abashed him to relate 'before ladies.' The
      sylph-like ease with which the Countess floated over this foul abysm was
      miraculous. Mr. George screwed his eye-lids queerly, and closed his jaws
      with a report, completely beaten. The anecdote was of the character of an
      apologue, and pertained to game. This was, as it happened, a misfortune;
      for Mr. Raikes had felt himself left behind by the subject; and the stuff
      that was in this young man being naturally ebullient, he lay by to trip
      it, and take a lead. His remarks brought on him a shrewd cut from the
      Countess, which made matters worse; for a pun may also breed puns, as doth
      an anecdote. The Countess's stroke was so neat and perfect that it was
      something for the gentlemen to think over; and to punish her for giving
      way to her cleverness and to petty vexation, 'Hem!' sounded once more, and
      then: 'May I ask you if the present Baronet is in England?'
    
    
      Now Lady Jocelyn perceived that some attack was directed against her
      guest. She allowed the Countess to answer:
    
    
      'The eldest was drowned in the Lisbon waters'
    
    
      And then said: 'But who is it that persists in serving up the funeral
      baked meats to us?'
    
    
      Mrs. Shorne spoke for her neighbour: 'Mr. Farnley's cousin was the steward
      of Sir Abraham Harrington's estates.'
    
    
      The Countess held up her head boldly. There is a courageous exaltation of
      the nerves known to heroes and great generals in action when they feel
      sure that resources within themselves will spring up to the emergency, and
      that over simple mortals success is positive.
    
    
      'I had a great respect for Sir Abraham,' Mr. Farnley explained, 'very
      great. I heard that this lady' (bowing to the Countess) 'was his
      daughter.'
    
    
      Lady Jocelyn's face wore an angry look, and Mrs. Shorne gave her the shade
      of a shrug and an expression implying, 'I didn't!'
    
    
      Evan was talking to Miss Jenny Graine at the moment rather earnestly. With
      a rapid glance at him, to see that his ears were closed, the Countess
      breathed:
    
    
      'Not the elder branch!       Cadet!'
    
    
      The sort of noisy silence produced by half-a-dozen people respirating
      deeply and moving in their seats was heard. The Countess watched Mr.
      Farnley's mystified look, and whispered to Sir John: 'Est-ce qu'il
      comprenne le Francais, lui?'
    
    
      It was the final feather-like touch to her triumph. She saw safety and a
      clear escape, and much joyful gain, and the pleasure of relating her
      sufferings in days to come. This vista was before her when, harsh as an
      execution bell, telling her that she had vanquished man, but that
      Providence opposed her, 'Mrs. Melchisedec Harrington!' was announced to
      Lady Jocelyn.
    
    
      Perfect stillness reigned immediately, as if the pic-nic had heard its
      doom.
    
    
      'Oh! I will go to her,' said her ladyship, whose first thought was to
      spare the family. 'Andrew, come and give me your arm.'
    
    
      But when she rose Mrs. Mel was no more than the length of an arm from her
      elbow.
    
    
      In the midst of the horrible anguish she was enduring, the Countess could
      not help criticizing her mother's curtsey to Lady Jocelyn. Fine, but a
      shade too humble. Still it was fine; all might not yet be lost.
    
    
      'Mama!' she softly exclaimed, and thanked heaven that she had not denied
      her parent.
    
    
      Mrs. Mel did not notice her or any of her children. There was in her bosom
      a terrible determination to cast a devil out of the one she best loved.
      For this purpose, heedless of all pain to be given, or of impropriety, she
      had come to speak publicly, and disgrace and humiliate, that she might
      save him from the devils that had ruined his father.
    
    
      'My lady,' said the terrible woman, thanking her in reply to an invitation
      that she should be seated, 'I have come for my son. I hear he has been
      playing the lord in your house, my lady. I humbly thank your ladyship for
      your kindness to him, but he is nothing more than a tailor's son, and is
      bound a tailor himself that his father may be called an honest man. I am
      come to take him away.'
    
    
      Mrs. Mel seemed to speak without much effort, though the pale flush of her
      cheeks showed that she felt what she was doing. Juliana was pale as death,
      watching Rose. Intensely bright with the gem-like light of her gallant
      spirit, Rose's eyes fixed on Evan. He met them. The words of Ruth passed
      through his heart. But the Countess, who had given Rose to Evan, and the
      Duke to Caroline, where was her supporter? The Duke was entertaining
      Caroline with no less dexterity, and Rose's eyes said to Evan: 'Feel no
      shame that I do not feel!' but the Countess stood alone. It is ever thus
      with genius! to quote the numerous illustrious authors who have written of
      it.
    
    
      What mattered it now that in the dead hush Lady Jocelyn should assure her
      mother that she had been misinformed, and that Mrs. Mel was presently
      quieted, and made to sit with others before the fruits and wines? All eyes
      were hateful       the very thought of Providence confused her brain.
      Almost reduced to imbecility, the Countess imagined, as a reality, that
      Sir Abraham had borne with her till her public announcement of
      relationship, and that then the outraged ghost would no longer be
      restrained, and had struck this blow.
    
    
      The crushed pic-nic tried to get a little air, and made attempts at
      conversation. Mrs. Mel sat upon the company with the weight of all
      tailordom.
    
    
      And now a messenger came for Harry. Everybody was so zealously employed in
      the struggle to appear comfortable under Mrs. Mel, that his departure was
      hardly observed. The general feeling for Evan and his sisters, by their
      superiors in rank, was one of kindly pity. Laxley, however, did not behave
      well. He put up his glass and scrutinized Mrs. Mel, and then examined
      Evan, and Rose thought that in his interchange of glances with any one
      there was a lurking revival of the scene gone by. She signalled with her
      eyebrows for Drummond to correct him, but Drummond had another occupation.
      Andrew made the diversion. He whispered to his neighbour, and the whisper
      went round, and the laugh; and Mr. Raikes grew extremely uneasy in his
      seat, and betrayed an extraordinary alarm. But he also was soon relieved.
      A messenger had come from Harry to Mrs. Evremonde, bearing a slip of
      paper. This the lady glanced at, and handed it to Drummond. A straggling
      pencil had traced these words:
    
    
      'Just running by S.W. gates       saw the Captain coming in       couldn't
      stop to stop him       tremendous hurry       important. Harry J.'
    
    
      Drummond sent the paper to Lady Jocelyn. After her perusal of it a scout
      was despatched to the summit of Olympus, and his report proclaimed the
      advance in the direction of the Bull-dogs of a smart little figure of a
      man in white hat and white trousers, who kept flicking his legs with a
      cane.
    
    
      Mrs. Evremonde rose and conferred with her ladyship an instant, and then
      Drummond took her arm quietly, and passed round Olympus to the East, and
      Lady Jocelyn broke up the sitting.
    
    
      Juliana saw Rose go up to Evan, and make him introduce her to his mother.
      She turned lividly white, and went to a corner of the park by herself, and
      cried bitterly.
    
    
      Lady Jocelyn, Sir Franks, and Sir John, remained by the tables, but before
      the guests were out of ear-shot, the individual signalled from Olympus
      presented himself.
    
    
      'There are times when one can't see what else to do but to lie,' said her
      ladyship to Sir Franks, 'and when we do lie the only way is to lie
      intrepidly.'
    
    
      Turning from her perplexed husband, she exclaimed:
    
    
      'Ah! Lawson?'
    
    
      Captain Evremonde lifted his hat, declining an intimacy.
    
    
      'Where is my wife, madam?'
    
    
      'Have you just come from the Arctic Regions?'
    
    
      'I have come for my wife, madam!'
    
    
      His unsettled grey eyes wandered restlessly on Lady Jocelyn's face. The
      Countess standing near the Duke, felt some pity for the wife of that
      cropped-headed, tight-skinned lunatic at large, but deeper was the
      Countess's pity for Lady Jocelyn, in thinking of the account she would
      have to render on the Day of Judgement, when she heard her ladyship reply       
    
    
      'Evelyn is not here.'
    
    
      Captain Evremonde bowed profoundly, trailing his broad white hat along the
      sward.
    
    
      'Do me the favour to read this, madam,' he said, and handed a letter to
      her.
    
    
      Lady Jocelyn raised her brows as she gathered the contents of the letter.
    
    
      'Ferdinand's handwriting!' she exclaimed.
    
    
      'I accuse no one, madam,       I make no accusation. I have every respect
      for you, madam,       you have my esteem. I am sorry to intrude, madam, an
      intrusion is regretted. My wife runs away from her bed, madam, and I have
      the law, madam, the law is with the husband. No force!' He lashed his cane
      sharply against his white legs. 'The law, madam. No brute force!' His cane
      made a furious whirl, cracking again on his legs, as he reiterated, 'The
      law!'
    
    
      'Does the law advise you to strike at a tangent all over the country in
      search for her?' inquired Lady Jocelyn.
    
    
      Captain Evremonde became ten times more voluble and excited.
    
    
      Mrs. Mel was heard by the Countess to say: 'Her ladyship does not know how
      to treat madmen.'
    
    
      Nor did Sir Franks and Sir John. They began expostulating with him.
    
    
      'A madman gets madder when you talk reason to him,' said Mrs. Mel.
    
    
      And now the Countess stepped forward to Lady Jocelyn, and hoped she would
      not be thought impertinent in offering her opinion as to how this frantic
      person should be treated. The case indeed looked urgent. Many gentlemen
      considered themselves bound to approach and be ready in case of need.
      Presently the Countess passed between Sir Franks and Sir John, and with
      her hand put up, as if she feared the furious cane, said:
    
    
      'You will not strike me?'
    
    
      'Strike a lady, madam?' The cane and hat were simultaneously lowered.
    
    
      'Lady Jocelyn permits me to fetch for you a gentleman of the law. Or will
      you accompany me to him?'
    
    
      In a moment, Captain Evremonde's manners were subdued and civilized, and
      in perfectly sane speech he thanked the Countess and offered her his arm.
      The Countess smilingly waved back Sir John, who motioned to attend on her,
      and away she went with the Captain, with all the glow of a woman who feels
      that she is heaping coals of fire on the heads of her enemies.
    
    
      Was she not admired now?
    
    
      'Upon my honour,' said Lady Jocelyn, 'they are a remarkable family,'
      meaning the Harringtons.
    
    
      What farther she thought she did not say, but she was a woman who looked
      to natural gifts more than the gifts of accidents; and Evan's chance stood
      high with her then. So the battle of the Bull-dogs was fought, and cruelly
      as the Countess had been assailed and wounded, she gained a victory; yea,
      though Demogorgon, aided by the vindictive ghost of Sir Abraham, took
      tangible shape in the ranks opposed to her. True, Lady Jocelyn, forgetting
      her own recent intrepidity, condemned her as a liar; but the fruits of the
      Countess's victory were plentiful. Drummond Forth, fearful perhaps of
      exciting unjust suspicions in the mind of Captain Evremonde, disappeared
      altogether. Harry was in a mess which threw him almost upon Evan's mercy,
      as will be related. And, lastly, Ferdinand Laxley, that insufferable young
      aristocrat, was thus spoken to by Lady Jocelyn.
    
    
      'This 'letter addressed to Lawson, telling him that his wife is here, is
      in your handwriting, Ferdinand. I don't say you wrote it       I don't
      think you could have written it. But, to tell you the truth, I have an
      unpleasant impression about it, and I think we had better shake hands and
      not see each other for some time.'
    
    
      Laxley, after one denial of his guilt, disdained to repeat it. He met her
      ladyship's hand haughtily, and, bowing to Sir Franks, turned on his heel.
    
    
      So, then, in glorious complete victory, the battle of the Bull-dogs ended!
    
    
      Of the close of the pic-nic more remains to be told.
    
    
      For the present I pause, in observance of those rules which demand that
      after an exhibition of consummate deeds, time be given to the spectator to
      digest what has passed before him.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XXXII. IN WHICH EVANS LIGHT BEGINS TO TWINKLE AGAIN
    
    
      The dowagers were now firmly planted on Olympus. Along the grass lay the
      warm strong colours of the evening sun, reddening the pine-stems and
      yellowing the idle aspen-leaves. For a moment it had hung in doubt whether
      the pic-nic could survive the two rude shocks it had received. Happily the
      youthful element was large, and when the band, refreshed by chicken and
      sherry, threw off half-a-dozen bars of one of those irresistible waltzes
      that first catch the ear, and then curl round the heart, till on a sudden
      they invade and will have the legs, a rush up Parnassus was seen, and
      there were shouts and laughter and commotion, as over other great fields
      of battle the corn will wave gaily and mark the reestablishment of
      nature's reign.
    
    
      How fair the sight! Approach the twirling couples. They talk as they
      whirl. 'Fancy the run-away tailor!' is the male's remark, and he expects
      to be admired for it, and is.
    
    
      'That make-up Countess       his sister, you know       didn't you see
      her? she turned green,' says Creation's second effort, almost occupying
      the place of a rib.
    
    
      'Isn't there a run-away wife, too?'
    
    
      'Now, you mustn't be naughty!'
    
    
      They laugh and flatter one another. The power to give and take flattery to
      any amount is the rare treasure of youth.
    
    
      Undoubtedly they are a poetical picture; but some poetical pictures talk
      dreary prose; so we will retire.
    
    
      Now, while the dancers carried on their business, and distance lent them
      enchantment, Rose stood by Juliana, near an alder which hid them from the
      rest.
    
    
      'I don't accuse you,' she was saying; 'but who could have done this but
      you? Ah, Juley! you will never get what you want if you plot for it. I
      thought once you cared for Evan. If he had loved you, would I not have
      done all that I could for you both? I pardon you with all my heart.'
    
    
      'Keep your pardon!' was the angry answer. 'I have done more for you, Rose.
      He is an adventurer, and I have tried to open your eyes and make you
      respect your family. You may accuse me of what you like, I have my
      conscience.'
    
    
      'And the friendship of the Countess,' added Rose.
    
    
      Juliana's figure shook as if she had been stung.
    
    
      'Go and be happy       don't stay here and taunt me,' she said, with a
      ghastly look. 'I suppose he can lie like his sister, and has told you all
      sorts of tales.'
    
    
      'Not a word       not a word!' cried Rose. 'Do you think my lover could
      tell a lie?'
    
    
      The superb assumption of the girl, and the true portrait of Evan's
      character which it flashed upon Juliana, were to the latter such intense
      pain, that she turned like one on the rack, exclaiming:
    
    
      'You think so much of him? You are so proud of him? Then, yes! I love him
      too, ugly, beastly as I am to look at! Oh, I know what you think! I loved
      him from the first, and I knew all about him, and spared him pain. I did
      not wait for him to fall from a horse. I watched every chance of his being
      exposed. I let them imagine he cared for me. Drummond would have told what
      he knew long before       only he knew there would not be much harm in a
      tradesman's son marrying me. And I have played into your hands, and now
      you taunt me!'
    
    
      Rose remembered her fretful unkindness to Evan on the subject of his
      birth, when her feelings toward him were less warm. Dwelling on that
      alone, she put her arms round Juliana's stiffening figure, and said: 'I
      dare say I am much more selfish than you. Forgive me, dear.'
    
    
      Staring at her, Juliana replied, 'Now you are acting.'
    
    
      'No,' said Rose, with a little effort to fondle her; 'I only feel that I
      love you better for loving him.'
    
    
      Generous as her words sounded, and were, Juliana intuitively struck to the
      root of them, which was comfortless. For how calm in its fortune, how
      strong in its love, must Rose's heart be, when she could speak in this
      unwonted way!
    
    
      'Go, and leave me, pray,' she said.
    
    
      Rose kissed her burning cheek. 'I will do as you wish, dear. Try and know
      me better, and be sister Juley as you used to be. I know I am thoughtless,
      and horribly vain and disagreeable sometimes. Do forgive me. I will love
      you truly.'
    
    
      Half melting, Juliana pressed her hand.
    
    
      'We are friends?' said Rose. 'Good-bye'; and her countenance lighted, and
      she moved away, so changed by her happiness! Juliana was jealous of a love
      strong as she deemed her own to overcome obstacles. She called to her:
      'Rose! Rose, you will not take advantage of what I have told you, and
      repeat it to any one?'
    
    
      Instantly Rose turned with a glance of full contempt over her shoulder.
    
    
      'To whom?' she asked.
    
    
      'To any one.'
    
    
      'To him? He would not love me long if I did!'
    
    
      Juliana burst into fresh tears, but Rose walked into the sunbeams and the
      circle of the music.
    
    
      Mounting Olympus, she inquired whether Ferdinand was within hail, as they
      were pledged to dance the first dance together. A few hints were given,
      and then Rose learnt that Ferdinand had been dismissed.
    
    
      'And where is he?' she cried with her accustomed impetuosity. 'Mama!       of
      course you did not accuse him       but, Mama! could you possibly let him
      go with the suspicion that you thought him guilty of writing an anonymous
      letter?'
    
    
      'Not at all,' Lady Jocelyn replied. 'Only the handwriting was so extremely
      like, and he was the only person who knew the address and the
      circumstances, and who could have a motive       though I don't quite see
      what it is       I thought it as well to part for a time.'
    
    
      'But that's sophistry!' said Rose. 'You accuse or you exonerate. Nobody
      can be half guilty. If you do not hold him innocent you are unjust!' Lady
      Jocelyn rejoined: 'Yes? It's singular what a stock of axioms young people
      have handy for their occasions.'
    
    
      Rose loudly announced that she would right this matter.
    
    
      'I can't think where Rose gets her passion for hot water,' said her
      mother, as Rose ran down the ledge.
    
    
      Two or three young gentlemen tried to engage her for a dance. She gave
      them plenty of promises, and hurried on till she met Evan, and, almost out
      of breath, told him the shameful injustice that had been done to her
      friend.
    
    
      'Mama is such an Epicurean! I really think she is worse than Papa. This
      disgraceful letter looks like Ferdinand's writing, and she tells him so;
      and, Evan! will you believe that instead of being certain it's impossible
      any gentleman could do such a thing, she tells Ferdinand she shall feel
      more comfortable if she doesn't see him for some time? Poor Ferdinand! He
      has had so much to bear!'
    
    
      Too sure of his darling to be envious now of any man she pitied, Evan
      said, 'I would forfeit my hand on his innocence!'
    
    
      'And so would I,' echoed Rose. 'Come to him with me, dear. Or no,' she
      added, with a little womanly discretion, 'perhaps it would not be so well       you're
      not very much cast down by what happened at dinner?'
    
    
      'My darling! I think of you.'
    
    
      'Of me, dear? Concealment is never of any service. What there is to be
      known people may as well know at once. They'll gossip for a month, and
      then forget it. Your mother is dreadfully outspoken, certainly; but she
      has better manners than many ladies       I mean people in a position: you
      understand me? But suppose, dear, this had happened, and I had said
      nothing to Mama, and then we had to confess? Ah, you'll find I'm wiser
      than you imagine, Mr. Evan.'
    
    
      'Haven't I submitted to somebody's lead?'
    
    
      'Yes, but with a sort of "under protest." I saw it by the mouth. Not quite
      natural. You have been moody ever since       just a little. I suppose
      it's our manly pride. But I'm losing time. Will you promise me not to
      brood over that occurrence? Think of me. Think everything of me. I am
      yours; and, dearest, if I love you, need you care what anybody else
      thinks? We will soon change their opinion.'
    
    
      'I care so little,' said Evan, somewhat untruthfully, 'that till you
      return I shall go and sit with my mother.'
    
    
      'Oh, she has gone. She made her dear old antiquated curtsey to Mama and
      the company. "If my son has not been guilty of deception, I will leave him
      to your good pleasure, my lady." That's what she said. Mama likes her, I
      know. But I wish she didn't mouth her words so precisely: it reminds me of       '
      the Countess, Rose checked herself from saying. 'Good-bye. Thank heaven!
      the worst has happened. Do you know what I should do if I were you, and
      felt at all distressed? I should keep repeating,' Rose looked archly and
      deeply up under his eyelids, "'I am the son of a tradesman, and Rose loves
      me," over and over, and then, if you feel ashamed, what is it of?'
    
    
      She nodded adieu, laughing at her own idea of her great worth; an idea
      very firmly fixed in her fair bosom, notwithstanding. Mrs. Melville said
      of her, 'I used to think she had pride.' Lady Jocelyn answered, 'So she
      has. The misfortune is that it has taken the wrong turning.'
    
    
      Evan watched the figure that was to him as that of an angel       no less!
      She spoke so frankly to them as she passed: or here and there went on with
      a light laugh. It seemed an act of graciousness that she should open her
      mouth to one! And, indeed, by virtue of a pride which raised her to the
      level of what she thought it well to do, Rose was veritably on higher
      ground than any present. She no longer envied her friend Jenny, who,
      emerging from the shades, allured by the waltz, dislinked herself from
      William's arm, and whispered exclamations of sorrow at the scene created
      by Mr. Harrington's mother. Rose patted her hand, and said: 'Thank you,
      Jenny dear but don't be sorry. I'm glad. It prevents a number of private
      explanations.'
    
    
      'Still, dear!' Jenny suggested.
    
    
      'Oh! of course, I should like to lay my whip across the shoulders of the
      person who arranged the conspiracy,' said Rose. 'And afterwards I don't
      mind returning thanks to him, or her, or them.'
    
    
      William cried out, 'I 'm always on your side, Rose.'
    
    
      'And I'll be Jenny's bridesmaid,' rejoined Rose, stepping blithely away
      from them.
    
    
      Evan debated whither to turn when Rose was lost to his eyes. He had no
      heart for dancing. Presently a servant approached, and said that Mr. Harry
      particularly desired to see him. From Harry's looks at table, Evan judged
      that the interview was not likely to be amicable. He asked the direction
      he was to take, and setting out with long strides, came in sight of
      Raikes, who walked in gloom, and was evidently labouring under one of his
      mountains of melancholy. He affected to be quite out of the world; but
      finding that Evan took the hint in his usual prosy manner, was reduced to
      call after him, and finally to run and catch him.
    
    
      'Haven't you one single spark of curiosity?' he began.
    
    
      'What about?' said Evan.
    
    
      'Why, about my amazing luck! You haven't asked a question. A matter of
      course.'
    
    
      Evan complimented him by asking a question: saying that Jack's luck
      certainly was wonderful.
    
    
      'Wonderful, you call it,' said Jack, witheringly. 'And what's more
      wonderful is, that I'd give up all for quiet quarters in the Green Dragon.
      I knew I was prophetic. I knew I should regret that peaceful hostelry.
      Diocletian, if you like. I beg you to listen. I can't walk so fast without
      danger.'
    
    
      'Well, speak out, man. What's the matter with you?' cried Evan,
      impatiently.
    
    
      Jack shook his head: 'I see a total absence of sympathy,' he remarked. 'I
      can't.'
    
    
      'Then stand out of the way.'
    
    
      Jack let him pass, exclaiming, with cold irony, 'I will pay homage to a
      loftier Nine!'
    
    
      Mr. Raikes could not in his soul imagine that Evan was really so little
      inquisitive concerning a business of such importance as the trouble that
      possessed him. He watched his friend striding off, incredulously, and then
      commenced running in pursuit.
    
    
      'Harrington, I give in; I surrender; you reduce me to prose. Thy nine have
      conquered my nine!       pardon me, old fellow. I'm immensely upset. This
      is the first day in my life that I ever felt what indigestion is. Egad,
      I've got something to derange the best digestion going!
    
    
      'Look here, Harrington. What happened to you today, I declare I think
      nothing of. You owe me your assistance, you do, indeed; for if it hadn't
      been for the fearful fascinations of your sister       that divine
      Countess       I should have been engaged to somebody by this time, and
      profited by the opportunity held out to me, and which is now gone. I 'm
      disgraced. I 'm known. And the worst of it is, I must face people. I
      daren't turn tail. Did you ever hear of such a dilemma?'
    
    
      'Ay,' quoth Evan, 'what is it?'
    
    
      Raikes turned pale. 'Then you haven't heard of it?' 'Not a word.'
    
    
      'Then it's all for me to tell. I called on Messrs. Grist. I dined at the
      Aurora afterwards. Depend upon it, Harrington, we're led by a star. I
      mean, fellows with anything in them are. I recognized our Fallow field
      host, and thinking to draw him out, I told our mutual histories. Next day
      I went to these Messrs. Grist. They proposed the membership for Fallow
      field, five hundred a year, and the loan of a curricle, on condition. It
      's singular, Harrington; before anybody knew of the condition I didn't
      care about it a bit. It seemed to me childish. Who would think of minding
      wearing a tin plate? But now!       the sufferings of Orestes       what
      are they to mine? He wasn't tied to his Furies. They did hover a little
      above him; but as for me, I'm scorched; and I mustn't say where: my mouth
      is locked; the social laws which forbid the employment of obsolete words
      arrest my exclamations of despair. What do you advise?'
    
    
      Evan stared a moment at the wretched object, whose dream of meeting a
      beneficent old gentleman had brought him to be the sport of a cynical
      farceur. He had shivers on his own account, seeing something of himself
      magnified, and he loathed the fellow, only to feel more acutely what a
      stigma may be.
    
    
      'It 's a case I can't advise in,' he said, as gently as he could. 'I
      should be off the grounds in a hurry.'
    
    
      'And then I'm where I was before I met the horrid old brute!' Raikes
      moaned.
    
    
      'I told him over a pint of port-and noble stuff is that Aurora port!       I
      told him       I amused him till he was on the point of bursting       I
      told him I was such a gentleman as the world hadn't seen       minus
      money. So he determined to launch me. He said I should lead the life of
      such a gentleman as the world had not yet seen       on that simple
      condition, which appeared to me childish, a senile whim; rather an
      indulgence of his.'
    
    
      Evan listened to the tribulations of his friend as he would to those of a
      doll       the sport of some experimental child. By this time he knew
      something of old Tom Cogglesby, and was not astonished that he should have
      chosen John Raikes to play one of his farces on. Jack turned off abruptly
      the moment he saw they were nearing human figures, but soon returned to
      Evan's side, as if for protection.
    
    
      'Hoy! Harrington!' shouted Harry, beckoning to him. 'Come, make haste! I'm
      in a deuce of a mess.'
    
    
      The two Wheedles       Susan and Polly       were standing in front of
      him, and after his call to Evan, he turned to continue some exhortation or
      appeal to the common sense of women, largely indulged in by young men when
      the mischief is done.
    
    
      'Harrington, do speak to her. She looks upon you as a sort of parson. I
      can't make her believe I didn't send for her. Of course, she knows I 'm
      fond of her. My dear fellow,' he whispered, 'I shall be ruined if my
      grandmother hears of it. Get her away, please. Promise anything.'
    
    
      Evan took her hand and asked for the child.
    
    
      'Quite well, sir,' faltered Susan.
    
    
      'You should not have come here.'
    
    
      Susan stared, and commenced whimpering: 'Didn't you wish it, sir?'
    
    
      'Oh, she's always thinking of being made a lady of,' cried Polly. 'As if
      Mr. Harry was going to do that. It wants a gentleman to do that.'
    
    
      'The carriage came for me, sir, in the afternoon,' said Susan,
      plaintively, 'with your compliments, and would I come. I thought       '
    
    
      'What carriage?' asked Evan.
    
    
      Raikes, who was ogling Polly, interposed grandly, 'Mine!'
    
    
      'And you sent in my name for this girl to come here?' Evan turned
      wrathfully on him.
    
    
      'My dear Harrington, when you hit you knock down. The wise require but one
      dose of experience. The Countess wished it, and I did dispatch.'
    
    
      'The Countess!' Harry exclaimed; 'Jove! do you mean to say that the
      Countess       '
    
    
      'De Saldar,' added Jack. 'In Britain none were worthy found.'
    
    
      Harry gave a long whistle.
    
    
      'Leave at once,' said Evan to Susan. 'Whatever you may want send to me
      for. And when you think you can meet your parents, I will take you to
      them. Remember that is what you must do.'
    
    
      'Make her give up that stupidness of hers, about being made a lady of, Mr.
      Harrington,' said the inveterate Polly.
    
    
      Susan here fell a-weeping.
    
    
      'I would go, sir,' she said. 'I 'm sure I would obey you: but I can't. I
      can't go back to the inn. They 're beginning to talk about me, because       because
      I can't       can't pay them, and I'm ashamed.'
    
    
      Evan looked at Harry.
    
    
      'I forgot,' the latter mumbled, but his face was crimson. He put his hands
      in his pockets. 'Do you happen to have a note or so?' he asked.
    
    
      Evan took him aside and gave him what he had; and this amount, without
      inspection or reserve, Harry offered to Susan. She dashed his hand
      impetuously from her sight.
    
    
      'There, give it to me,' said Polly. 'Oh, Mr. Harry! what a young man you
      are!'
    
    
      Whether from the rebuff, or the reproach, or old feelings reviving, Harry
      was moved to go forward, and lay his hand on Susan's shoulder and mutter
      something in her ear that softened her.
    
    
      Polly thrust the notes into her bosom, and with a toss of her nose, as who
      should say, 'Here 's nonsense they 're at again,' tapped Susan on the
      other shoulder, and said imperiously: 'Come, Miss!'
    
    
      Hurrying out a dozen sentences in one, Harry ended by suddenly kissing
      Susan's cheek, and then Polly bore her away; and Harry, with great
      solemnity, said to Evan:
    
    
      ''Pon my honour, I think I ought to! I declare I think I love that girl.
      What's one's family? Why shouldn't you button to the one that just suits
      you? That girl, when she's dressed, and in good trim, by Jove! nobody 'd
      know her from a born lady. And as for grammar, I'd soon teach her that.'
    
    
      Harry began to whistle: a sign in him that he was thinking his hardest.
    
    
      'I confess to being considerably impressed by the maid Wheedle,' said
      Raikes.
    
    
      'Would you throw yourself away on her?' Evan inquired.
    
    
      Apparently forgetting how he stood, Mr. Raikes replied:
    
    
      'You ask, perhaps, a little too much of me. One owes consideration to
      one's position. In the world's eyes a matrimonial slip outweighs a
      peccadillo. No. To much the maid might wheedle me, but to Hymen! She's
      decidedly fresh and pert       the most delicious little fat lips and
      cocky nose; but cease we to dwell on her, or of us two, to! one will be
      undone.'
    
    
      Harry burst into a laugh: 'Is this the T.P. for Fallow field?'
    
    
      'M.P. I think you mean,' quoth Raikes, serenely; but a curious glance
      being directed on him, and pursuing him pertinaciously, it was as if the
      pediment of the lofty monument he topped were smitten with violence. He
      stammered an excuse, and retreated somewhat as it is the fashion to do
      from the presence of royalty, followed by Harry's roar of laughter, in
      which Evan cruelly joined.
    
    
      'Gracious powers!' exclaimed the victim of ambition, 'I'm laughed at by
      the son of a tailor!' and he edged once more into the shade of trees.
    
    
      It was a strange sight for Harry's relatives to see him arm-in-arm with
      the man he should have been kicking, challenging, denouncing, or whatever
      the code prescribes: to see him talking to this young man earnestly,
      clinging to him affectionately, and when he separated from him, heartily
      wringing his hand. Well might they think that there was something
      extraordinary in these Harringtons. Convicted of Tailordom, these
      Harringtons appeared to shine with double lustre. How was it? They were at
      a loss to say. They certainly could say that the Countess was egregiously
      affected and vulgar; but who could be altogether complacent and sincere
      that had to fight so hard a fight? In this struggle with society I see one
      of the instances where success is entirely to be honoured and remains a
      proof of merit. For however boldly antagonism may storm the ranks of
      society, it will certainly be repelled, whereas affinity cannot be
      resisted; and they who, against obstacles of birth, claim and keep their
      position among the educated and refined, have that affinity. It is, on the
      whole, rare, so that society is not often invaded. I think it will have to
      front Jack Cade again before another Old Mel and his progeny shall appear.
      You refuse to believe in Old Mel? You know not nature's cunning.
    
    
      Mrs. Shorne, Mrs. Melville, Miss Carrington, and many of the guests who
      observed Evan moving from place to place, after the exposure, as they
      called it, were amazed at his audacity. There seemed such a quietly superb
      air about him. He would not look out of his element; and this, knowing
      what they knew, was his offence. He deserved some commendation for still
      holding up his head, but it was love and Rose who kept the fires of his
      heart alive.
    
    
      The sun had sunk. The figures on the summit of Parnassus were seen bobbing
      in happy placidity against the twilight sky. The sun had sunk, and many of
      Mr. Raikes' best things were unspoken. Wandering about in his gloom, he
      heard a feminine voice:
    
    
      'Yes, I will trust you.'
    
    
      'You will not repent it,' was answered.
    
    
      Recognizing the Duke, Mr. Raikes cleared his throat.
    
    
      'A-hem, your Grace! This is how the days should pass. I think we should
      diurnally station a good London band on high, and play his Majesty to bed       the
      sun. My opinion is, it would improve the crops. I'm not, as yet, a landed
      proprietor       '
    
    
      The Duke stepped aside with him, and Raikes addressed no one for the next
      twenty minutes. When he next came forth Parnassus was half deserted. It
      was known that old Mrs. Bonner had been taken with a dangerous attack, and
      under this third blow the pic-nic succumbed. Simultaneously with the
      messenger that brought the news to Lady Jocelyn, one approached Evan, and
      informed him that the Countess de Saldar urgently entreated him to come to
      the house without delay. He also wished to speak a few words to her, and
      stepped forward briskly. He had no prophetic intimations of the change
      this interview would bring upon him.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XXXIII. THE HERO TAKES HIS RANK IN THE ORCHESTRA
    
    
      The Countess was not in her dressing-room when Evan presented himself. She
      was in attendance on Mrs. Bonner, Conning said; and the primness of
      Conning was a thing to have been noticed by any one save a dreamy youth in
      love. Conning remained in the room, keeping distinctly aloof. Her duties
      absorbed her, but a presiding thought mechanically jerked back her head
      from time to time: being the mute form of, 'Well, I never!' in Conning's
      rank of life and intellectual capacity. Evan remained quite still in a
      chair, and Conning was certainly a number of paces beyond suspicion, when
      the Countess appeared, and hurling at the maid one of those feminine looks
      which contain huge quartos of meaning, vented the cold query:
    
    
      'Pray, why did you not come to me, as you were commanded?'
    
    
      'I was not aware, my lady,' Conning drew up to reply, and performed with
      her eyes a lofty rejection of the volume cast at her, and a threat of
      several for offensive operations, if need were.
    
    
      The Countess spoke nearer to what she was implying 'You know I object to
      this: it is not the first time.'
    
    
      'Would your ladyship please to say what your ladyship means?'
    
    
      In return for this insolent challenge to throw off the mask, the Countess
      felt justified in punishing her by being explicit. 'Your irregularities
      are not of yesterday,' she said, kindly making use of a word of double
      signification still.
    
    
      'Thank you, my lady.' Conning accepted the word in its blackest meaning.
      'I am obliged to you. If your ladyship is to be believed, my character is
      not worth much. But I can make distinctions, my lady.'
    
    
      Something very like an altercation was continued in a sharp, brief
      undertone; and then Evan, waking up to the affairs of the hour, heard
      Conning say:
    
    
      'I shall not ask your ladyship to give me a character.'
    
    
      The Countess answering with pathos: 'It would, indeed, be to give you
      one.'
    
    
      He was astonished that the Countess should burst into tears when Conning
      had departed, and yet more so that his effort to console her should bring
      a bolt of wrath upon himself.
    
    
      'Now, Evan, now see what you have done for us-do, and rejoice at it. The
      very menials insult us. You heard what that creature said? She can make
      distinctions. Oh! I could beat her. They know it: all the servants know
      it: I can see it in their faces. I feel it when I pass them. The insolent
      wretches treat us as impostors; and this Conning       to defy me! Oh! it
      comes of my devotion to you. I am properly chastized. I passed Rose's maid
      on the stairs, and her reverence was barely perceptible.'
    
    
      Evan murmured that he was very sorry, adding, foolishly: 'Do you really
      care, Louisa, for what servants think and say?'
    
    
      The Countess sighed deeply: 'Oh! you are too thickskinned! Your mother
      from top to toe! It is too dreadful! What have I done to deserve it? Oh,
      Evan, Evan!'
    
    
      Her head dropped in her lap. There was something ludicrous to Evan in this
      excess of grief on account of such a business; but he was tender-hearted
      and wrought upon to declare that, whether or not he was to blame for his
      mother's intrusion that afternoon, he was ready to do what he could to
      make up to the Countess for her sufferings: whereat the Countess sighed
      again: asked him what he possibly could do, and doubted his willingness to
      accede to the most trifling request.
    
    
      'No; I do in verity believe that were I to desire you to do aught for your
      own good alone, you would demur, Van.'
    
    
      He assured her that she was mistaken.
    
    
      'We shall see,' she said.
    
    
      'And if once or twice, I have run counter to you, Louisa       '
    
    
      'Abominable language!' cried the Countess, stopping her ears like a child.
      'Do not excruciate me so. You laugh! My goodness! what will you come to!'
    
    
      Evan checked his smile, and, taking her hand, said:
    
    
      'I must tell you; that, on the whole, I see nothing to regret in what has
      happened to-day. You may notice a change in the manners of the servants
      and some of the country squiresses, but I find none in the bearing of the
      real ladies, the true gentlemen, to me.'
    
    
      'Because the change is too fine for you to perceive it,' interposed the
      Countess.
    
    
      'Rose, then, and her mother, and her father!' Evan cried impetuously.
    
    
      'As for Lady Jocelyn!' the Countess shrugged:
    
    
      'And Sir Franks!' her head shook: 'and Rose, Rose is, simply self-willed;
      a "she will" or "she won't" sort of little person. No criterion!
      Henceforth the world is against us. We have to struggle with it: it does
      not rank us of it!'
    
    
      'Your feeling on the point is so exaggerated, my dear Louisa', said Evan,
      'one can't bring reason to your ears. The tattle we shall hear we shall
      outlive. I care extremely for the good opinion of men, but I prefer my
      own; and I do not lose it because my father was in trade.'
    
    
      'And your own name, Evan Harrington, is on a shop,' the Countess struck
      in, and watched him severely from under her brow, glad to mark that he
      could still blush.
    
    
      'Oh, heaven!' she wailed to increase the effect, 'on a shop! a brother of
      mine!'
    
    
      'Yes, Louisa. It may not last... I did it       is it not better that a
      son should blush, than cast dishonour on his father's memory?'
    
    
      'Ridiculous boy-notion!'
    
    
      'Rose has pardoned it, Louisa       cannot you? I find that the naturally
      vulgar and narrow-headed people, and cowards who never forego mean
      advantages, are those only who would condemn me and my conduct in that.'
    
    
      'And you have joy in your fraction of the world left to you!' exclaimed
      his female-elder.
    
    
      Changeing her manner to a winning softness, she said:
    
    
      'Let me also belong to the very small party! You have been really
      romantic, and most generous and noble; only the shop smells! But, never
      mind, promise me you will not enter it.'
    
    
      'I hope not,' said Evan.
    
    
      'You do hope that you will not officiate? Oh, Evan the eternal
      contemplation of gentlemen's legs! think of that! Think of yourself
      sculptured in that attitude!' Innumerable little prickles and stings shot
      over Evan's skin.
    
    
      'There       there, Louisa!' he said, impatiently; 'spare your ridicule.
      We go to London to-morrow, and when there I expect to hear that I have an
      appointment, and that this engagement is over.' He rose and walked up and
      down the room.
    
    
      'I shall not be prepared to go to-morrow,' remarked the Countess, drawing
      her figure up stiffly.
    
    
      'Oh! well, if you can stay, Andrew will take charge of you, I dare say.'
    
    
      'No, my dear, Andrew will not       a nonentity cannot       you must.'
    
    
      'Impossible, Louisa,' said Evan, as one who imagines he is uttering a
      thing of little consequence. 'I promised Rose.'
    
    
      'You promised Rose that you would abdicate and retire? Sweet, loving
      girl!'
    
    
      Evan made no answer.
    
    
      'You will stay with me, Evan.'
    
    
      'I really can't,' he said in his previous careless tone.
    
    
      'Come and sit down,' cried the Countess, imperiously.
    
    
      'The first trifle is refused. It does not astonish me. I will honour you
      now by talking seriously to you. I have treated you hitherto as a child.
      Or, no       ' she stopped her mouth; 'it is enough if I tell you, dear,
      that poor Mrs. Bonner is dying, and that she desires my attendance on her
      to refresh her spirit with readings on the Prophecies, and Scriptural
      converse. No other soul in the house can so soothe her.'
    
    
      'Then, stay,' said Evan.
    
    
      'Unprotected in the midst of enemies! Truly!'
    
    
      'I think, Louisa, if you can call Lady Jocelyn an enemy, you must read the
      Scriptures by a false light.'
    
    
      'The woman is an utter heathen!' interjected the Countess. 'An infidel can
      be no friend. She is therefore the reverse. Her opinions embitter her
      mother's last days. But now you will consent to remain with me, dear Van!'
    
    
      An implacable negative responded to the urgent appeal of her eyes.
    
    
      'By the way,' he said, for a diversion, 'did you know of a girl stopping
      at an inn in Fallow field?'
    
    
      'Know a barmaid?' the Countess's eyes and mouth were wide at the question.
    
    
      'Did you send Raikes for her to-day?'
    
    
      'Did Mr. Raikes       ah, Evan! that creature reminds me, you have no
      sense of contrast. For a Brazilian ape       he resembles, if he is not
      truly one       what contrast is he to an English gentleman! His proximity
      and acquaintance       rich as he may be       disfigure you. Study
      contrast!'
    
    
      Evan had to remind her that she had not answered him: whereat she
      exclaimed: 'One would really think you had never been abroad. Have you not
      evaded me, rather?'
    
    
      The Countess commenced fanning her languid brows, and then pursued: 'Now,
      my dear brother, I may conclude that you will acquiesce in my moderate
      wishes. You remain. My venerable friend cannot last three days. She is on
      the brink of a better world! I will confide to you that it is of the
      utmost importance we should be here, on the spot, until the sad
      termination! That is what I summoned you for. You are now at liberty.
      Ta-ta, as soon as you please.'
    
    
      She had baffled his little cross-examination with regard to Raikes, but on
      the other point he was firm. She would listen to nothing: she affected
      that her mandate had gone forth, and must be obeyed; tapped with her foot,
      fanned deliberately, and was a consummate queen, till he turned the handle
      of the door, when her complexion deadened, she started up, trembling, and
      tripping towards him, caught him by the arm, and said: 'Stop! After all
      that I have sacrificed for you! As well try to raise the dead as a Dawley
      from the dust he grovels in! Why did I consent to visit this place? It was
      for you. I came, I heard that you had disgraced yourself in drunkenness at
      Fallow field, and I toiled to eclipse that, and I did. Young Jocelyn
      thought you were what you are I could spit the word at you! and I dazzled
      him to give you time to win this minx, who will spin you like a top if you
      get her. That Mr. Forth knew it as well, and that vile young Laxley. They
      are gone! Why are they gone? Because they thwarted me       they crossed
      your interests       I said they should go. George Uplift is going to-day.
      The house is left to us; and I believe firmly that Mrs. Bonner's will
      contains a memento of the effect of our frequent religious conversations.
      So you would leave now? I suspect nobody, but we are all human, and Wills
      would not have been tampered with for the first time. Besides, and the
      Countess's imagination warmed till she addressed her brother as a
      confederate, 'we shall then see to whom Beckley Court is bequeathed.
      Either way it may be yours. Yours! and you suffer their plots to drive you
      forth. Do you not perceive that Mama was brought here to-day on purpose to
      shame us and cast us out? We are surrounded by conspiracies, but if our
      faith is pure who can hurt us? If I had not that consolation       would
      that you had it, too!       would it be endurable to me to see those
      menials whispering and showing their forced respect? As it is, I am
      fortified to forgive them. I breathe another atmosphere. Oh, Evan! you did
      not attend to Mr. Parsley's beautiful last sermon. The Church should have
      been your vocation.'
    
    
      From vehemence the Countess had subsided to a mournful gentleness. She had
      been too excited to notice any changes in her brother's face during her
      speech, and when he turned from the door, and still eyeing her fixedly,
      led her to a chair, she fancied from his silence that she had subdued and
      convinced him. A delicious sense of her power, succeeded by a weary
      reflection that she had constantly to employ it, occupied her mind, and
      when presently she looked up from the shade of her hand, it was to agitate
      her head pitifully at her brother.
    
    
      'All this you have done for me, Louisa,' he said.
    
    
      'Yes, Evan,       all!' she fell into his tone.
    
    
      'And you are the cause of Laxley's going? Did you know anything of that
      anonymous letter?'
    
    
      He was squeezing her hand-with grateful affection, as she was deluded to
      imagine.
    
    
      'Perhaps, dear,       a little,' her conceit prompted her to admit.
    
    
      'Did you write it?'
    
    
      He gazed intently into her eyes, and as the question shot like a javelin,
      she tried ineffectually to disengage her fingers; her delusion waned; she
      took fright, but it was too late; he had struck the truth out of her
      before she could speak. Her spirit writhed like a snake in his hold.
      Innumerable things she was ready to say, and strove to; the words would
      not form on her lips.
    
    
      'I will be answered, Louisa.'
    
    
      The stern manner he had assumed gave her no hope of eluding him. With an
      inward gasp, and a sensation of nakedness altogether new to her, dismal,
      and alarming, she felt that she could not lie. Like a creature forsaken of
      her staunchest friend, she could have flung herself to the floor. The next
      instant her natural courage restored her. She jumped up and stood at bay.
    
    
      'Yes. I did.'
    
    
      And now he was weak, and she was strong, and used her strength.
    
    
      'I wrote it to save you. Yes. Call on your Creator, and be my judge, if
      you dare. Never, never will you meet a soul more utterly devoted to you,
      Evan. This Mr. Forth, this Laxley, I said, should go, because they were
      resolved to ruin you, and make you base. They are gone. The responsibility
      I take on myself. Nightly       during the remainder of my days       I
      will pray for pardon.'
    
    
      He raised his head to ask sombrely: 'Is your handwriting like Laxley's?'
    
    
      'It seems so,' she answered, with a pitiful sneer for one who could arrest
      her exaltation to inquire about minutiae. 'Right or wrong, it is done, and
      if you choose to be my judge, think whether your own conscience is clear.
      Why did you come here? Why did you stay? You have your free will,       do
      you deny that? Oh, I will take the entire blame, but you must not be a
      hypocrite, Van. You know you were aware. We had no confidences. I was
      obliged to treat you like a child; but for you to pretend to suppose that
      roses grow in your path       oh, that is paltry! You are a hypocrite or
      an imbecile, if that is your course.'
    
    
      Was he not something of the former? The luxurious mist in which he had
      been living, dispersed before his sister's bitter words, and, as she
      designed he should, he felt himself her accomplice. But, again, reason
      struggled to enlighten him; for surely he would never have done a thing so
      disproportionate to the end to be gamed! It was the unconnected action of
      his brain that thus advised him. No thoroughly-fashioned, clear-spirited
      man conceives wickedness impossible to him: but wickedness so largely
      mixed with folly, the best of us may reject as not among our temptations.
      Evan, since his love had dawned, had begun to talk with his own nature,
      and though he knew not yet how much it would stretch or contract, he knew
      that he was weak and could not perform moral wonders without severe
      struggles. The cynic may add, if he likes       or without potent liquors.
    
    
      Could he be his sister's judge? It is dangerous for young men to be too
      good. They are so sweeping in their condemnations, so sublime in their
      conceptions of excellence, and the most finished Puritan cannot out-do
      their demands upon frail humanity. Evan's momentary self-examination saved
      him from this, and he told the Countess, with a sort of cold compassion,
      that he himself dared not blame her.
    
    
      His tone was distinctly wanting in admiration of her, but she was somewhat
      over-wrought, and leaned her shoulder against him, and became immediately
      his affectionate, only too-zealous, sister; dearly to be loved, to be
      forgiven, to be prized: and on condition of inserting a special petition
      for pardon in her orisons, to live with a calm conscience, and to be
      allowed to have her own way with him during the rest of her days.
    
    
      It was a happy union       a picture that the Countess was lured to admire
      in the glass.
    
    
      Sad that so small a murmur should destroy it for ever!
    
    
      'What?' cried the Countess, bursting from his arm.
    
    
      'Go?' she emphasized with the hardness of determined unbelief, as if
      plucking the words, one by one, out of her reluctant ears. 'Go to Lady
      Jocelyn, and tell her I wrote the letter?'
    
    
      'You can do no less, I fear,' said Evan, eyeing the floor and breathing a
      deep breath.
    
    
      'Then I did hear you correctly? Oh, you must be mad-idiotic! There, pray
      go away, Evan. Come in the morning. You are too much for my nerves.'
    
    
      Evan rose, putting out his hand as if to take hers and plead with her. She
      rejected the first motion, and repeated her desire for him to leave her;
      saying, cheerfully       
    
    
      'Good night, dear; I dare say we shan't meet till the morning.'
    
    
      'You can't let this injustice continue a single night, Louisa?' said he.
    
    
      She was deep in the business of arrangeing a portion of her attire.
    
    
      'Go-go; please,' she responded.
    
    
      Lingering, he said: 'If I go, it will be straight to Lady Jocelyn.'
    
    
      She stamped angrily.
    
    
      'Only go!' and then she found him gone, and she stooped lower to the
      glass, to mark if the recent agitation were observable under her eyes.
      There, looking at herself, her heart dropped heavily in her bosom. She ran
      to the door and hurried swiftly after Evan, pulling him back speechlessly.
    
    
      'Where are you going, Evan?'
    
    
      'To Lady Jocelyn.'
    
    
      The unhappy victim of her devotion stood panting.
    
    
      'If you go, I       I take poison!' It was for him now to be struck; but
      he was suffering too strong an anguish to be susceptible to mock tragedy.
      The Countess paused to study him. She began to fear her brother. 'I will!'
      she reiterated wildly, without moving him at all. And the quiet
      inflexibility of his face forbade the ultimate hope which lies in giving
      men a dose of hysterics when they are obstinate. She tried by taunts and
      angry vituperations to make him look fierce, if but an instant, to
      precipitate her into an exhibition she was so well prepared for.
    
    
      'Evan! what! after all my love, my confidence in you       I need not have
      told you       to expose us! Brother? would you? Oh!'
    
    
      'I will not let this last another hour,' said Evan, firmly, at the same
      time seeking to caress her. She spurned his fruitless affection, feeling,
      nevertheless, how cruel was her fate; for, with any other save a brother,
      she had arts at her disposal to melt the manliest resolutions. The glass
      showed her that her face was pathetically pale; the tones of her voice
      were rich and harrowing. What did they avail with a brother? 'Promise me,'
      she cried eagerly, 'promise me to stop here       on this spot-till I
      return.'
    
    
      The promise was extracted. The Countess went to fetch Caroline. Evan did
      not count the minutes. One thought was mounting in his brain-the scorn of
      Rose. He felt that he had lost her. Lost her when he had just won her! He
      felt it, without realizing it. The first blows of an immense grief are
      dull, and strike the heart through wool, as it were. The belief of the
      young in their sorrow has to be flogged into them, on the good old
      educational principle. Could he do less than this he was about to do? Rose
      had wedded her noble nature to him, and it was as much her spirit as his
      own that urged him thus to forfeit her, to be worthy of her by assuming
      unworthiness.
    
    
      There he sat neither conning over his determination nor the cause for it,
      revolving Rose's words about Laxley, and nothing else. The words were so
      sweet and so bitter; every now and then the heavy smiting on his heart set
      it quivering and leaping, as the whip starts a jaded horse.
    
    
      Meantime the Countess was participating in a witty conversation in the
      drawing-room with Sir John and the Duke, Miss Current, and others; and it
      was not till after she had displayed many graces, and, as one or two
      ladies presumed to consider, marked effrontery, that she rose and drew
      Caroline away with her. Returning to her dressing-room, she found that
      Evan had faithfully kept his engagement; he was on the exact spot where
      she had left him.
    
    
      Caroline came to him swiftly, and put her hand to his forehead that she
      might the better peruse his features, saying, in her mellow caressing
      voice: 'What is this, dear Van, that you will do? Why do you look so
      wretched?'
    
    
      'Has not Louisa told you?'
    
    
      'She has told me something, dear, but I don't know what it is. That you
      are going to expose us? What further exposure do we need? I'm sure, Van,
      my pride       what I had       is gone. I have none left!'
    
    
      Evan kissed her brows warmly. An explanation, full of the Countess's
      passionate outcries of justification, necessity, and innocence in higher
      than fleshly eyes, was given, and then the three were silent.
    
    
      'But, Van,' Caroline commenced, deprecatingly, 'my darling! of what use       now!
      Whether right or wrong, why should you, why should you, when the thing is
      done, dear?       think!'
    
    
      'And you, too, would let another suffer under an unjust accusation?' said
      Evan.
    
    
      'But, dearest, it is surely your duty to think of your family first. Have
      we not been afflicted enough? Why should you lay us under this fresh
      burden?'
    
    
      'Because it 's better to bear all now than a life of remorse,' answered
      Evan.
    
    
      'But this Mr. Laxley       I cannot pity him; he has behaved so insolently
      to you throughout! Let him suffer.'
    
    
      'Lady Jocelyn,' said Evan, 'has been unintentionally unjust to him, and
      after her kindness       apart from the right or wrong       I will not       I
      can't allow her to continue so.'
    
    
      'After her kindness!' echoed the Countess, who had been fuming at
      Caroline's weak expostulations. 'Kindness! Have I not done ten times for
      these Jocelyns what they have done for us? O mio Deus! why, I have
      bestowed on them the membership for Fallow field: I have saved her from
      being a convicted liar this very day. Worse! for what would have been
      talked of the morals of the house, supposing the scandal. Oh! indeed I was
      tempted to bring that horrid mad Captain into the house face to face with
      his flighty doll of a wife, as I, perhaps, should have done, acting by the
      dictates of my conscience. I lied for Lady Jocelyn, and handed the man to
      a lawyer, who withdrew him. And this they owe to me! Kindness? They have
      given us bed and board, as the people say. I have repaid them for that.'
    
    
      'Pray be silent, Louisa,' said Evan, getting up hastily, for the sick
      sensation Rose had experienced came over him. His sister's plots, her
      untruth, her coarseness, clung to him and seemed part of his blood. He now
      had a personal desire to cut himself loose from the wretched entanglement
      revealed to him, whatever it cost.
    
    
      'Are you really, truly going?' Caroline exclaimed, for he was near the
      door.
    
    
      'At a quarter to twelve at night!' sneered the Countess, still imagining
      that he, like herself, must be partly acting.
    
    
      'But, Van, is it       dearest, think! is it manly for a brother to go and
      tell of his sister? And how would it look?'
    
    
      Evan smiled. 'Is it that that makes you unhappy? Louisa's name will not be
      mentioned       be sure of that.'
    
    
      Caroline was stooping forward to him. Her figure straightened: 'Good
      Heaven, Evan! you are not going to take it on yourself? Rose!       she
      will hate you.'
    
    
      'God help me!' he cried internally.
    
    
      'Oh, Evan, darling! consider, reflect!' She fell on her knees, catching
      his hand. 'It is worse for us that you should suffer, dearest! Think of
      the dreadful meanness and baseness of what you will have to acknowledge.'
    
    
      'Yes!' sighed the youth, and his eyes, in his extreme pain, turned to the
      Countess reproachfully.
    
    
      'Think, dear,' Caroline hurried on, 'he gains nothing for whom you do this       you
      lose all. It is not your deed. You will have to speak an untruth. Your
      ideas are wrong       wrong, I know they are. You will have to lie. But if
      you are silent, the little, little blame that may attach to us will pass
      away, and we shall be happy in seeing our brother happy.'
    
    
      'You are talking to Evan as if he had religion,' said the Countess, with
      steady sedateness. And at that moment, from the sublimity of his pagan
      virtue, the young man groaned for some pure certain light to guide him:
      the question whether he was about to do right made him weak. He took
      Caroline's head between his two hands, and kissed her mouth. The act
      brought Rose to his senses insufferably, and she       his Goddess of
      truth and his sole guiding light-spurred him afresh.
    
    
      'My family's dishonour is mine, Caroline. Say nothing more       don't
      think of me. I go to Lady Jocelyn tonight. To-morrow we leave, and there's
      the end. Louisa, if you have any new schemes for my welfare, I beg you to
      renounce them.'
    
    
      'Gratitude I never expected from a Dawley!' the Countess retorted.
    
    
      'Oh, Louisa! he is going!' cried Caroline; 'kneel to him with me: stop
      him: Rose loves him, and he is going to make her hate him.'
    
    
      'You can't talk reason to one who's mad,' said the Countess, more like the
      Dawley she sprang from than it would have pleased her to know.
    
    
      'My darling! My own Evan! it will kill me,' Caroline exclaimed, and
      passionately imploring him, she looked so hopelessly beautiful, that Evan
      was agitated, and caressed her, while he said, softly: 'Where our honour
      is not involved I would submit to your smallest wish.'
    
    
      'It involves my life       my destiny!' murmured Caroline.
    
    
      Could he have known the double meaning in her words, and what a saving
      this sacrifice of his was to accomplish, he would not have turned to do it
      feeling abandoned of heaven and earth.
    
    
      The Countess stood rigidly as he went forth. Caroline was on her knees,
      sobbing.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XXXIV. A PAGAN SACRIFICE
    
    
      Three steps from the Countess's chamber door, the knot of Evan's
      resolution began to slacken. The clear light of his simple duty grew
      cloudy and complex. His pride would not let him think that he was
      shrinking, but cried out in him, 'Will you be believed?' and whispered
      that few would believe him guilty of such an act. Yet, while something
      said that full surely Lady Jocelyn would not, a vague dread that Rose
      might, threw him back on the luxury of her love and faith in him. He found
      himself hoping that his statement would be laughed at. Then why make it?
    
    
      No: that was too blind a hope. Many would take him at his word; all       all
      save Lady Jocelyn! Rose the first! Because he stood so high with her now
      he feared the fall. Ah, dazzling pinnacle! our darlings shoot us up on a
      wondrous juggler's pole, and we talk familiarly to the stars, and are so
      much above everybody, and try to walk like creatures with two legs,
      forgetting that we have but a pin's point to stand on up there. Probably
      the absence of natural motion inspires the prophecy that we must
      ultimately come down: our unused legs wax morbidly restless. Evan thought
      it good that Rose should lift her head to look at him; nevertheless, he
      knew that Rose would turn from him the moment he descended from his
      superior station. Nature is wise in her young children, though they wot
      not of it, and are always trying to rush away from her. They escape their
      wits sooner than their instincts.
    
    
      But was not Rose involved in him, and part of him? Had he not sworn never
      to renounce her? What was this but a betrayal?
    
    
      Go on, young man: fight your fight. The little imps pluck at you: the big
      giant assails you: the seductions of the soft-mouthed siren are not
      wanting. Slacken the knot an instant, and they will all have play. And the
      worst is, that you may be wrong, and they may be right! For is it, can it
      be proper for you to stain the silvery whiteness of your skin by plunging
      headlong into yonder pitch-bath? Consider the defilement! Contemplate your
      hideous aspect on issuing from that black baptism!
    
    
      As to the honour of your family, Mr. Evan Harrington, pray, of what sort
      of metal consists the honour of a tailor's family?
    
    
      One little impertinent imp ventured upon that question on his own account.
      The clever beast was torn back and strangled instantaneously by his
      experienced elders, but not before Evan's pride had answered him. Exalted
      by Love, he could dread to abase himself and strip off his glittering
      garments; lowered by the world, he fell back upon his innate worth.
    
    
      Yes, he was called on to prove it; he was on his way to prove it.
      Surrendering his dearest and his best, casting aside his dreams, his
      desires, his aspirations, for this stern duty, he at least would know that
      he made himself doubly worthy of her who abandoned him, and the world
      would scorn him by reason of his absolute merit. Coming to this point, the
      knot of his resolve tightened again; he hugged it with the furious zeal of
      a martyr.
    
    
      Religion, the lack of which in him the Countess deplored, would have
      guided him and silenced the internal strife. But do not despise a virtue
      purely Pagan. The young who can act readily up to the Christian light are
      happier, doubtless: but they are led, they are passive: I think they do
      not make such capital Christians subsequently. They are never in such
      danger, we know; but some in the flock are more than sheep. The heathen
      ideal it is not so very easy to attain, and those who mount from it to the
      Christian have, in my humble thought, a firmer footing.
    
    
      So Evan fought his hard fight from the top of the stairs to the bottom. A
      Pagan, which means our poor unsupported flesh, is never certain of his
      victory. Now you will see him kneeling to his Gods, and anon drubbing
      them; or he makes them fight for him, and is complacent at the issue. Evan
      had ceased to pick his knot with one hand and pull it with the other: but
      not finding Lady Jocelyn below, and hearing that she had retired for the
      night, he mounted the stairs, and the strife recommenced from the bottom
      to the top. Strange to say, he was almost unaware of any struggle going on
      within him. The suggestion of the foolish little imp alone was loud in the
      heart of his consciousness; the rest hung more in his nerves than in his
      brain. He thought: 'Well, I will speak it out to her in the morning'; and
      thought so sincerely, while an ominous sigh of relief at the reprieve rose
      from his over-burdened bosom.
    
    
      Hardly had the weary deep breath taken flight, when the figure of Lady
      Jocelyn was seen advancing along the corridor, with a lamp in her hand.
      She trod heavily, in a kind of march, as her habit was; her large
      fully-open grey eyes looking straight ahead. She would have passed him,
      and he would have let her pass, but seeing the unusual pallor on her face,
      his love for this lady moved him to step forward and express a hope that
      she had no present cause for sorrow.
    
    
      Hearing her mother's name, Lady Jocelyn was about to return a conventional
      answer. Recognizing Evan, she said:
    
    
      'Ah! Mr. Harrington! Yes, I fear it's as bad as it can be. She can
      scarcely outlive the night.'
    
    
      Again he stood alone: his chance was gone. How could he speak to her in
      her affliction? Her calm sedate visage had the beauty of its youth, when
      lighted by the animation that attends meetings or farewells. In her bow to
      Evan, he beheld a lovely kindness more unique, if less precious, than
      anything he had ever seen on the face of Rose. Half exultingly, he
      reflected that no opportunity would be allowed him now to teach that noble
      head and truest of human hearts to turn from him: the clear-eyed morrow
      would come: the days of the future would be bright as other days!
    
    
      Wrapped in the comfort of his cowardice, he started to see Lady Jocelyn
      advancing to him again.
    
    
      'Mr. Harrington,' she said, 'Rose tells me you leave us early in the
      morning. I may as well shake your hand now. We part very good friends. I
      shall always be glad to hear of you.'
    
    
      Evan pressed her hand, and bowed. 'I thank you, madam,' was all he could
      answer.
    
    
      'It will be better if you don't write to Rose.'
    
    
      Her tone was rather that of a request than an injunction.
    
    
      'I have no right to do so, my lady.'
    
    
      'She considers that you have: I wish her to have, a fair trial.'
    
    
      His voice quavered. The philosophic lady thought it time to leave him.
    
    
      'So good-bye. I can trust you without extracting a promise. If you ever
      have need of a friend, you know you are at liberty to write to me.'
    
    
      'You are tired, my lady?' He put this question more to dally with what he
      ought to be saying.
    
    
      'Tolerably. Your sister, the Countess, relieves me in the night. I fancy
      my mother finds her the better nurse of the two.'
    
    
      Lady Jocelyn's face lighted in its gracious pleasant way, as she just
      inclined her head: but the mention of the Countess and her attendance on
      Mrs. Bonner had nerved Evan: the contrast of her hypocrisy and vile
      scheming with this most open, noble nature, acted like a new force within
      him. He begged Lady Jocelyn's permission to speak with her in private.
      Marking his fervid appearance, she looked at him seriously.
    
    
      'Is it really important?'
    
    
      'I cannot rest, madam, till it is spoken.'
    
    
      'I mean, it doesn't pertain to the delirium? We may sleep upon that.'
    
    
      He divined her sufficiently to answer: 'It concerns a piece of injustice
      done by you, madam, and which I can help you to set right.'
    
    
      Lady Jocelyn stared somewhat. 'Follow me into my dressing-room,' she said,
      and led the way.
    
    
      Escape was no longer possible. He was on the march to execution, and into
      the darkness of his brain danced John Raikes, with his grotesque
      tribulations. It was the harsh savour of reality that conjured up this
      flighty being, who probably never felt a sorrow or a duty. The farce Jack
      lived was all that Evan's tragic bitterness could revolve, and seemed to
      be the only light in his mind. You might have seen a smile on his mouth
      when he was ready to ask for a bolt from heaven to crush him.
    
    
      'Now,' said her ladyship, and he found that the four walls enclosed them,
      'what have I been doing?'
    
    
      She did not bid him be seated. Her brevity influenced him to speak to the
      point.
    
    
      'You have dismissed Mr. Laxley, my lady: he is innocent.'
    
    
      'How do you know that?'
    
    
      'Because,'       a whirl of sensations beset the wretched youth, 'because
      I am guilty.'
    
    
      His words had run ahead of his wits; and in answer to Lady Jocelyn's
      singular exclamation he could but simply repeat them.
    
    
      Her head drew back; her face was slightly raised; she looked, as he had
      seen her sometimes look at the Countess, with a sort of speculative
      amazement.
    
    
      'And why do you come to tell me?'
    
    
      'For the reason that I cannot allow you to be unjust, madam.'
    
    
      'What on earth was your motive?'
    
    
      Evan stood silent, flinching from her frank eyes.
    
    
      'Well, well, well!' Her ladyship dropped into a chair, and thumped her
      knees.
    
    
      There was lawyer's blood in Lady Jocelyn's veins she had the judicial
      mind. A confession was to her a confession. She tracked actions up to a
      motive; but one who came voluntarily to confess needed no sifting. She had
      the habit of treating things spoken as facts.
    
    
      'You absolutely wrote that letter to Mrs. Evremonde's husband!'
    
    
      Evan bowed, to avoid hearing his own lie.
    
    
      'You discovered his address and wrote to him, and imitated Mr. Laxley's
      handwriting, to effect the purpose you may have had?'
    
    
      Her credulity did require his confirmation of it, and he repeated: 'It is
      my deed.'
    
    
      'Hum! And you sent that premonitory slip of paper to her?'
    
    
      'To Mrs. Evremonde?'
    
    
      'Somebody else was the author of that, perhaps?'
    
    
      'It is all on me.'
    
    
      'In that case, Mr. Harrington, I can only say that it's quite right you
      should quit this house to-morrow morning.'
    
    
      Her ladyship commenced rocking in her chair, and then added: 'May I ask,
      have you madness in your family? No? Because when one can't discern a
      motive, it's natural to ascribe certain acts to madness. Had Mrs.
      Evremonde offended you? or Ferdinand       but one only hears of such
      practices towards fortunate rivals, and now you have come to undo what you
      did! I must admit, that taking the monstrousness of the act and the
      inconsequence of your proceedings together, the whole affair becomes more
      incomprehensible to me than it was before. Would it be unpleasant to you
      to favour me with explanations?'
    
    
      She saw the pain her question gave him, and, passing it, said:
    
    
      'Of course you need not be told that Rose must hear of this?'
    
    
      'Yes,' said Evan, 'she must hear it.'
    
    
      'You know what that 's equivalent to? But, if you like, I will not speak
      to her till you, have left us.'
    
    
      'Instantly,' cried Evan. 'Now-to-night! I would not have her live a minute
      in a false estimate of me.'
    
    
      Had Lady Jocelyn's intellect been as penetrating as it was masculine, she
      would have taken him and turned him inside out in a very short time; for
      one who would bear to see his love look coldly on him rather than endure a
      minute's false estimate of his character, and who could yet stoop to
      concoct a vile plot, must either be mad or simulating the baseness for
      some reason or other. She perceived no motive for the latter, and she held
      him to be sound in the head, and what was spoken from the mouth she
      accepted. Perhaps, also, she saw in the complication thus offered an
      escape for Rose, and was the less inclined to elucidate it herself. But if
      her intellect was baffled, her heart was unerring. A man proved guilty of
      writing an anonymous letter would not have been allowed to stand long in
      her room. She would have shown him to the door of the house speedily; and
      Evan was aware in his soul that he had not fallen materially in her
      esteem. He had puzzled and confused her, and partly because she had the
      feeling that this young man was entirely trustworthy, and because she
      never relied on her feelings, she let his own words condemn him, and did
      not personally discard him. In fact, she was a veritable philosopher. She
      permitted her fellows to move the world on as they would, and had no other
      passions in the contemplation of the show than a cultured audience will
      usually exhibit.
    
    
      'Strange,       most strange! I thought I was getting old!' she said, and
      eyed the culprit as judges generally are not wont to do. 'It will be a
      shock to Rose. I must tell you that I can't regret it. I would not have
      employed force with her, but I should have given her as strong a taste of
      the world as it was in my power to give. Girls get their reason from
      society. But, come! if you think you can make your case out better to her,
      you shall speak to her first yourself.'
    
    
      'No, my lady,' said Evan, softly.
    
    
      'You would rather not?'
    
    
      'I could not.'
    
    
      'But, I suppose, she'll want to speak to you when she knows it.'
    
    
      'I can take death from her hands, but I cannot slay myself.'
    
    
      The language was natural to his condition, though the note was pitched
      high. Lady Jocelyn hummed till the sound of it was over, and an idea
      striking her, she said:
    
    
      'Ah, by the way, have you any tremendous moral notions?'
    
    
      'I don't think I have, madam.'
    
    
      'People act on that mania sometimes, I believe. Do you think it an outrage
      on decency for a wife to run away from a mad husband whom they won't shut
      up, and take shelter with a friend? Is that the cause? Mr. Forth is an old
      friend of mine. I would trust my daughter with him in a desert, and stake
      my hand on his honour.'
    
    
      'Oh, Lady Jocelyn!' cried Evan. 'Would to God you might ever have said
      that of me! Madam, I love you. I shall never see you again. I shall never
      meet one to treat me so generously. I leave you, blackened in character       you
      cannot think of me without contempt. I can never hope that this will
      change. But, for your kindness let me thank you.'
    
    
      And as speech is poor where emotion is extreme       and he knew his own
      to be especially so       he took her hand with petitioning eyes, and
      dropping on one knee, reverentially kissed it.
    
    
      Lady Jocelyn was human enough to like to be appreciated. She was a veteran
      Pagan, and may have had the instinct that a peculiar virtue in this young
      one was the spring of his conduct. She stood up and said: 'Don't forget
      that you have a friend here.'
    
    
      The poor youth had to turn his head from her.
    
    
      'You wish that I should tell Rose what you have told me at once, Mr.
      Harrington?'
    
    
      'Yes, my lady; I beg that you will do so.'
    
    
      'Well!'
    
    
      And the queer look Lady Jocelyn had been wearing dimpled into absolute
      wonder. A stranger to Love's cunning, she marvelled why he should desire
      to witness the scorn Rose would feel for him.
    
    
      'If she's not asleep, then, she shall hear it now,' said her ladyship.
      'You understand that it will be mentioned to no other person.'
    
    
      'Except to Mr. Laxley, madam, to whom I shall offer the satisfaction he
      may require. But I will undertake that.'
    
    
      'Just as you think proper on that matter,' remarked her philosophical
      ladyship, who held that man was a fighting animal, and must not have his
      nature repressed.
    
    
      She lighted him part of the way, and then turned off to Rose's chamber.
    
    
      Would Rose believe it of him? Love combated his dismal foreboding.
      Strangely, too, now that he had plunged into his pitch-bath, the guilt
      seemed to cling to him, and instead of hoping serenely, or fearing
      steadily, his spirit fell in a kind of abject supplication to Rose, and
      blindly trusted that she would still love even if she believed him base.
      In his weakness he fell so low as to pray that she might love that
      crawling reptile who could creep into a house and shrink from no vileness
      to win her.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XXXV. ROSE WOUNDED
    
    
      The light of morning was yet cold along the passages of the house when
      Polly Wheedle, hurrying to her young mistress, met her loosely dressed and
      with a troubled face.
    
    
      'What 's the matter, Polly? I was coming to you.'
    
    
      'O, Miss Rose! and I was coming to you. Miss Bonner's gone back to her
      convulsions again. She's had them all night. Her hair won't last till
      thirty, if she keeps on giving way to temper, as I tell her: and I know
      that from a barber.'
    
    
      'Tush, you stupid Polly! Does she want to see me?'
    
    
      'You needn't suspect that, Miss. But you quiet her best, and I thought I'd
      come to you. But, gracious!'
    
    
      Rose pushed past her without vouchsafing any answer to the look in her
      face, and turned off to Juliana's chamber, where she was neither welcomed
      nor repelled. Juliana said she was perfectly well, and that Polly was
      foolishly officious: whereupon Rose ordered Polly out of the room, and
      said to Juliana, kindly: 'You have not slept, dear, and I have not either.
      I am so unhappy.'
    
    
      Whether Rose intended by this communication to make Juliana eagerly
      attentive, and to distract her from her own affair, cannot be said, but
      something of the effect was produced.
    
    
      'You care for him, too,' cried Rose, impetuously. 'Tell me, Juley: do you
      think him capable of any base action? Do you think he would do what any
      gentleman would be ashamed to own? Tell me.'
    
    
      Juliana looked at Rose intently, but did not reply.
    
    
      Rose jumped up from the bed. 'You hesitate, Juley? What? Could you think
      so?'
    
    
      Young women after a common game are shrewd. Juliana may have seen that
      Rose was not steady on the plank she walked, and required support.
    
    
      'I don't know,' she said, turning her cheek to her pillow.
    
    
      'What an answer!' Rose exclaimed. 'Have you no opinion? What did you say
      yesterday? It's silent as the grave with me: but if you do care for him,
      you must think one thing or the other.'
    
    
      'I suppose not, then       no,' said Juliana.
    
    
      Repeating the languid words bitterly, Rose continued:
    
    
      'What is it to love without having faith in him you love? You make my mind
      easier.'
    
    
      Juliana caught the implied taunt, and said, fretfully:
    
    
      'I'm ill. You're so passionate. You don't tell me what it is. How can I
      answer you?'
    
    
      'Never mind,' said Rose, moving to the door, wondering why she had spoken
      at all: but when Juliana sprang forward, and caught her by the dress to
      stop her, and with a most unwonted outburst of affection, begged of her to
      tell her all, the wound in Rose's breast began to bleed, and she was glad
      to speak.
    
    
      'Juley, do you-can you believe that he wrote that letter which poor
      Ferdinand was       accused of writing?'
    
    
      Juliana appeared to muse, and then responded: 'Why should he do such a
      thing?'
    
    
      'O my goodness, what a girl!' Rose interjected.
    
    
      'Well, then, to please you, Rose, of course I think he is too honourable.'
    
    
      'You do think so, Juley? But if he himself confessed it       what then?
      You would not believe him, would you?'
    
    
      'Oh, then I can't say. Why should he condemn himself?'
    
    
      'But you would know       you would know that he was a man to suffer death
      rather than be guilty of the smallest baseness. His birth       what is
      that!' Rose filliped her fingers: 'But his acts       what he is himself
      you would be sure of, would you not? Dear Juley! Oh, for heaven's sake,
      speak out plainly to me.'
    
    
      A wily look had crept over Juliana's features.
    
    
      'Certainly,' she said, in a tone that belied it, and drawing Rose to her
      bosom, the groan she heard there was passing sweet to her.
    
    
      'He has confessed it to Mama,' sobbed Rose. 'Why did he not come to me
      first? He has confessed it       the abominable thing has come out of his
      own mouth. He went to her last night...'
    
    
      Juliana patted her shoulders regularly as they heaved. When words were
      intelligible between them, Juliana said:
    
    
      'At least, dear, you must admit that he has redeemed it.'
    
    
      'Redeemed it? Could he do less?' Rose dried her eyes vehemently, as if the
      tears shamed her. 'A man who could have let another suffer for his crime       I
      could never have lifted my head again. I think I would have cut off this
      hand that plighted itself to him! As it is, I hardly dare look at myself.
      But you don't think it, dear? You know it to be false! false! false!'
    
    
      'Why should Mr. Harrington confess it?' said Juliana.
    
    
      'Oh, don't speak his name!' cried Rose.
    
    
      Her cousin smiled. 'So many strange things happen,' she said, and sighed.
    
    
      'Don't sigh: I shall think you believe it!' cried Rose. An appearance of
      constrained repose was assumed. Rose glanced up, studied for an instant,
      and breathlessly uttered: 'You do, you do believe it, Juley?'
    
    
      For answer, Juliana hugged her with much warmth, and recommenced the
      patting.
    
    
      'I dare say it's a mistake,' she remarked. 'He may have been jealous of
      Ferdinand. You know I have not seen the letter. I have only heard of it.
      In love, they say, you ought to excuse... And the want of religious
      education! His sister...'
    
    
      Rose interrupted her with a sharp shudder. Might it not be possible that
      one who had the same blood as the Countess would stoop to a momentary
      vileness.
    
    
      How changed was Rose from the haughty damsel of yesterday!
    
    
      'Do you think my lover could tell a lie?' 'He       would not love me long
      if I did!'
    
    
      These phrases arose and rang in Juliana's ears while she pursued the task
      of comforting the broken spirit that now lay prone on the bed, and now
      impetuously paced the room. Rose had come thinking the moment Juliana's
      name was mentioned, that here was the one to fortify her faith in Evan:
      one who, because she loved, could not doubt him. She moaned in a terror of
      distrust, loathing her cousin: not asking herself why she needed support.
      And indeed she was too young for much clear self-questioning, and her
      blood was flowing too quickly for her brain to perceive more than one
      thing at a time.
    
    
      'Does your mother believe it?' said Juliana, evading a direct assault.
    
    
      'Mama? She never doubts what you speak,' answered Rose, disconsolately.
    
    
      'She does?'
    
    
      'Yes.'
    
    
      Whereat Juliana looked most grave, and Rose felt that it was hard to
      breathe.
    
    
      She had grown very cold and calm, and Juliana had to be expansive
      unprovoked.
    
    
      'Believe nothing, dear, till you hear it from his own lips. If he can look
      in your face and say that he did it... well, then! But of course he
      cannot. It must be some wonderful piece of generosity to his rival.'
    
    
      'So I thought, Juley! so I thought,' cried Rose, at the new light, and
      Juliana smiled contemptuously, and the light flickered and died, and all
      was darker than before in the bosom of Rose. She had borne so much that
      this new drop was poison.
    
    
      'Of course it must be that, if it is anything,' Juliana pursued. 'You were
      made to be happy, Rose. And consider, if it is true, people of very low
      birth, till they have lived long with other people, and if they have no
      religion, are so very likely to do things. You do not judge them as you do
      real gentlemen, and one must not be too harsh       I only wish to prepare
      you for the worst.'
    
    
      A dim form of that very idea had passed through Rose, giving her small
      comfort.
    
    
      'Let him tell you with his own lips that what he has told your mother is
      true, and then, and not till then, believe him,' Juliana concluded, and
      they kissed kindly, and separated. Rose had suddenly lost her firm step,
      but no sooner was Juliana alone than she left the bed, and addressed her
      visage to the glass with brightening eyes, as one who saw the glimmer of
      young hope therein.
    
    
      'She love him! Not if he told me so ten thousand times would I believe it!
      and before he has said a syllable she doubts him. Asking me in that
      frantic way! as if I couldn't see that she wanted me to help her to her
      faith in him, as she calls it. Not name his name? Mr. Harrington! I may
      call him Evan: some day!'
    
    
      Half-uttered, half-mused, the unconscious exclamations issued from her,
      and for many a weary day since she had dreamed of love, and studied that
      which is said to attract the creature, she had not been so glowingly
      elated or looked so much farther in the glass than its pale reflection.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XXXVI. BEFORE BREAKFAST
    
    
      Cold through the night the dark-fringed stream had whispered under Evan's
      eyes, and the night breeze voiced 'Fool, fool!' to him, not without a
      distant echo in his heart. By symbols and sensations he knew that Rose was
      lost to him. There was no moon: the water seemed aimless, passing on
      carelessly to oblivion. Now and then, the trees stirred and talked, or a
      noise was heard from the pastures. He had slain the life that lived in
      them, and the great glory they were to bring forth, and the end to which
      all things moved. Had less than the loss of Rose been involved, the young
      man might have found himself looking out on a world beneath notice, and
      have been sighing for one more worthy of his clouded excellence but the
      immense misery present to him in the contemplation of Rose's sad
      restrained contempt, saved him from the silly elation which is the last,
      and generally successful, struggle of human nature in those who can so far
      master it to commit a sacrifice. The loss of that brave high young
      soul-Rose, who had lifted him out of the mire with her own white hands:
      Rose, the image of all that he worshipped: Rose, so closely wedded to him
      that to be cut away from her was to fall like pallid clay from the soaring
      spirit: surely he was stunned and senseless when he went to utter the
      words to her mother! Now that he was awake, and could feel his
      self-inflicted pain, he marvelled at his rashness and foolishness, as
      perhaps numerous mangled warriors have done for a time, when the
      battle-field was cool, and they were weak, and the uproar of their jarred
      nerves has beset them, lying uncherished.
    
    
      By degrees he grew aware of a little consolatory touch, like the point of
      a needle, in his consciousness. Laxley would certainly insult him! In that
      case he would not refuse to fight him. The darkness broke and revealed
      this happy prospect, and Evan held to it an hour, and could hardly reject
      it when better thoughts conquered. For would it not be sweet to make the
      strength of his arm respected? He took a stick, and ran his eye musingly
      along the length, trifling with it grimly. The great Mel had been his
      son's instructor in the chivalrous science of fence, and a maitre d'armes
      in Portugal had given him polish. In Mel's time duels with swords had been
      occasionally fought, and Evan looked on the sword as the weapon of combat.
      Face to face with his adversary       what then were birth or position?
      Action!       action! he sighed for it, as I have done since I came to
      know that his history must be morally developed. A glow of bitter pleasure
      exalted him when, after hot passages, and parryings and thrusts, he had
      disarmed Ferdinand Laxley, and bestowing on him his life, said: 'Accept
      this worthy gift of the son of a tailor!' and he wiped his sword, haply
      bound up his wrist, and stalked off the ground, the vindicator of man's
      natural dignity. And then he turned upon himself with laughter,
      discovering a most wholesome power, barely to be suspected in him yet; but
      of all the children of glittering Mel and his solid mate, Evan was the
      best mixed compound of his parents.
    
    
      He put the stick back in its corner and eyed his wrist, as if he had
      really just gone through the pretty scene he had just laughed at. It was
      nigh upon reality, for it suggested the employment of a handkerchief, and
      he went to a place and drew forth one that had the stain of his blood on
      it, and the name of Rose at one end. The beloved name was half-blotted by
      the dull-red mark, and at that sight a strange tenderness took hold of
      Evan. His passions became dead and of old date. This, then, would be his
      for ever! Love, for whom earth had been too small, crept exultingly into a
      nut-shell. He clasped the treasure on his breast, and saw a life beyond
      his parting with her.
    
    
      Strengthened thus, he wrote by the morning light to Laxley. The letter was
      brief, and said simply that the act of which Laxley had been accused, Evan
      Harrington was responsible for. The latter expressed regret that Laxley
      should have fallen under a false charge, and, at the same time, indicated
      that if Laxley considered himself personally aggrieved, the writer was at
      his disposal.
    
    
      A messenger had now to be found to convey it to the village-inn. Footmen
      were stirring about the house, and one meeting Evan close by his door,
      observed with demure grin, that he could not find the gentleman's
      nether-garments. The gentleman, it appeared, was Mr. John Raikes, who
      according to report, had been furnished with a bed at the house, because
      of a discovery, made at a late period over-night, that farther the
      gentleman could not go. Evan found him sleeping soundly. How much the poor
      youth wanted a friend! Fortune had given him instead a born buffoon; and
      it is perhaps the greatest evil of a position like Evan's, that, with
      cultured feelings, you are likely to meet with none to know you. Society
      does not mix well in money-pecking spheres. Here, however, was John
      Raikes, and Evan had to make the best of him.
    
    
      'Eh?' yawned Jack, awakened; 'I was dreaming I was Napoleon Bonaparte's
      right-hand man.'
    
    
      'I want you to be mine for half-an-hour,' said Evan.
    
    
      Without replying, the distinguished officer jumped out of bed at a bound,
      mounted a chair, and peered on tip-toe over the top, from which, with a
      glance of self-congratulation, he pulled the missing piece of apparel,
      sighed dejectedly as he descended, while he exclaimed:
    
    
      'Safe! but no distinction can compensate a man for this state of
      intolerable suspicion of everybody. I assure you, Harrington, I wouldn't
      be Napoleon himself       and I have always been his peculiar admirer       to
      live and be afraid of my valet! I believe it will develop cancer sooner or
      later in me. I feel singular pains already. Last night, after crowning
      champagne with ale, which produced a sort of French Revolution in my
      interior       by the way, that must have made me dream of Napoleon last
      night, with my lower members in revolt against my head, I had to sit and
      cogitate for hours on a hiding-place for these-call them what you will.
      Depend upon it, Harrington, this world is no such funny affair as we
      fancy.'
    
    
      'Then it is true, that you could let a man play pranks on you,' said Evan.
      'I took it for one of your jokes.'
    
    
      'Just as I can't believe that you're a tailor,' returned Jack. 'It 's not
      a bit more extraordinary.'
    
    
      'But, Jack, if you cause yourself to be contemptible              '
    
    
      'Contemptible!' cried Jack. 'This is not the tone I like. Contemptible!
      why it's my eccentricity among my equals. If I dread the profane vulgar,
      that only proves that I'm above them. Odi, etc. Besides, Achilles had his
      weak point, and egad, it was when he faced about! By Jingo! I wish I'd had
      that idea yesterday. I should have behaved better.'
    
    
      Evan could see that the creature was beginning to rely desperately on his
      humour.
    
    
      'Come,' he said, 'be a man to-day. Throw off your motley. When I met you
      that night so oddly, you had been acting like a worthy fellow, trying to
      earn your bread in the best way you could       '
    
    
      'And precisely because I met you, of all men, I've been going round and
      round ever since,' said Jack. 'A clown or pantaloon would have given me
      balance. Say no more. You couldn't help it. We met because we were the two
      extremes.'
    
    
      Sighing, 'What a jolly old inn!' Raikes rolled himself over in the sheets,
      and gave two or three snug jolts indicative of his determination to be
      comfortable while he could.
    
    
      'Do you intend to carry on this folly, Jack?'
    
    
      'Say, sacrifice,' was the answer. 'I feel it as much as you possibly
      could, Mr. Harrington. Hear the facts,' Jack turned round again. 'Why did
      I consent to this absurdity? Because of my ambition. That old fellow, whom
      I took to be a clerk of Messrs. Grist, said: "You want to cut a figure in
      the world       you're armed now." A sort of Fortunatus's joke. It was his
      way of launching me. But did he think I intended this for more than a
      lift? I his puppet? He, sir, was my tool! Well, I came. All my efforts
      were strained to shorten the period of penance. I had the best linen, and
      put on captivating manners. I should undoubtedly have won some girl of
      station, and cast off my engagement like an old suit, but just mark!       now
      mark how Fortune tricks us! After the pic-nic yesterday, the domestics of
      the house came to clear away, and the band being there, I stopped them and
      bade them tune up, and at the same time seizing the maid Wheedle, away we
      flew. We danced, we whirled, we twirled. Ale upon this! My head was lost.
      "Why don't it last for ever?" says I. "I wish it did," says she. The
      naivete enraptured me. "Oooo!" I cried, hugging her, and then, you know,
      there was no course open to a man of honour but to offer marriage and make
      a lady of her. I proposed: she accepted me, and here I am, eternally tied
      to this accurst insignia, if I'm to keep my promise! Isn't that a
      sacrifice, friend H.? There's no course open to me. The poor girl is madly
      in love. She called me a "rattle!" As a gentleman, I cannot recede.'
    
    
      Evan got up and burst into damnable laughter at this burlesque of himself.
      Telling the fellow the service he required, and receiving a groaning
      assurance that the letter should, without loss of time, be delivered in
      proper style, the egoist, as Jack heartily thought him, fell behind his;
      knitted brows, and, after musing abstractedly, went forth to light upon
      his fate.
    
    
      But a dread of meeting had seized both Rose and Evan. She had exhausted
      her first sincerity of unbelief in her interview with Juliana: and he had
      begun to consider what he could say to her. More than the three words 'I
      did it,' would not be possible; and if she made him repeat them, facing
      her truthful eyes, would he be man enough to strike her bared heart twice?
      And, ah! the sullen brute he must seem, standing before her dumb, hearing
      her sigh, seeing her wretched effort not to show how unwillingly her kind
      spirit despised him. The reason for the act       she would ask for that!
      Rose would not be so philosophic as her mother. She would grasp at every
      chance to excuse the deed. He cried out against his scheming sister in an
      agony, and while he did so, encountered Miss Carrington and Miss. Bonner
      in deep converse. Juliana pinched her arm, whereupon Miss Carrington said:
      'You look merry this morning, Mr. Harrington': for he was unawares smiling
      at the image of himself in the mirror of John Raikes. That smile,
      transformed to a chuckling grimace, travelled to Rose before they met.
    
    
      Why did she not come to him?
    
    
      A soft voice at his elbow made his blood stop. It was Caroline. She kissed
      him, answering his greeting: 'Is it good morning?'
    
    
      'Certainly,' said he. 'By the way, don't forget that the coach leaves
      early.'
    
    
      'My darling Evan! you make me so happy. For it was really a mistaken sense
      of honour. For what can at all excuse a falsehood, you know, Evan!'
    
    
      Caroline took his arm, and led him into the sun, watching his face at
      times. Presently she said: 'I want just to be assured that you thought
      more wisely than when you left us last night.'
    
    
      'More wisely?' Evan turned to her with a playful smile.
    
    
      'My dear brother! you did not do what you said you would do?'
    
    
      'Have you ever known me not to do what I said I would do?'
    
    
      'Evan! Good heaven! you did it? Then how can you remain here an instant?
      Oh, no, no!       say no, darling!'
    
    
      'Where is Louisa?' he inquired.
    
    
      'She is in her room. She will never appear at breakfast, if she knows
      this.'
    
    
      'Perhaps more solitude would do her good,' said Evan.
    
    
      'Remember, if this should prove true, think how you punish her!'
    
    
      On that point Evan had his own opinion.
    
    
      'Well, I shall never have to punish you in this way, my love, he said
      fondly, and Caroline dropped her eyelids.
    
    
      'Don't think that I am blaming her,' he added, trying to feel as honestly
      as he spoke. 'I was mad to come here. I see it all now. Let us keep to our
      place. We are all the same before God till we disgrace ourselves.'
      Possibly with that sense of shame which some young people have who are not
      professors of sounding sentences, or affected by missionary zeal, when
      they venture to breathe the holy name, Evan blushed, and walked on humbly
      silent. Caroline murmured: 'Yes, yes! oh, brother!' and her figure drew to
      him as if for protection. Pale, she looked up.
    
    
      'Shall you always love me, Evan?'
    
    
      'Whom else have I to love?'
    
    
      'But always       always? Under any circumstances?'
    
    
      'More and more, dear. I always have, and shall. I look to you now. I have
      no home but in your heart now.'
    
    
      She was agitated, and he spoke warmly to calm her.
    
    
      The throb of deep emotion rang in her rich voice. 'I will live any life to
      be worthy of your love, Evan,' and she wept.
    
    
      To him they were words and tears without a history.
    
    
      Nothing further passed between them. Caroline went to the Countess: Evan
      waited for Rose. The sun was getting high. The face of the stream glowed
      like metal. Why did she not come? She believed him guilty from the mouth
      of another? If so, there was something less for him to lose. And now the
      sacrifice he had made did whisper a tale of mortal magnificence in his
      ears: feelings that were not his noblest stood up exalted. He waited till
      the warm meadow-breath floating past told that the day had settled into
      heat, and then he waited no more, but quietly walked into the house with
      the strength of one who has conquered more than human scorn.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XXXVII. THE RETREAT FROM BECKLEY
    
    
      Never would the Countess believe that brother of hers, idiot as by nature
      he might be, and heir to unnumbered epithets, would so far forget what she
      had done for him, as to drag her through the mud for nothing: and so she
      told Caroline again and again, vehemently.
    
    
      It was about ten minutes before the time for descending to the
      breakfast-table. She was dressed, and sat before the glass, smoothing her
      hair, and applying the contents of a pot of cold cream to her forehead
      between-whiles. With perfect sincerity she repeated that she could not
      believe it. She had only trusted Evan once since their visit to Beckley;
      and that this once he should, when treated as a man, turn traitor to their
      common interests, and prove himself an utter baby, was a piece of nonsense
      her great intelligence indignantly rejected.
    
    
      'Then, if true,' she answered Caroline's assurances finally, 'if true, he
      is not his father's son!'
    
    
      By which it may be seen that she had indeed taken refuge in the Castle of
      Negation against the whole army of facts.
    
    
      'He is acting, Carry. He is acting the ideas of his ridiculous empty
      noddle!'
    
    
      'No,' said Caroline, mournfully, 'he is not. I have never known Evan to
      lie.'
    
    
      'Then you must forget the whipping he once had from his mother       little
      dolt! little selfish pig! He obtains his reputation entirely from his
      abominable selfishness, and then stands tall, and asks us to admire him.
      He bursts with vanity. But if you lend your credence to it, Carry, how, in
      the name of goodness, are you to appear at the breakfast?
    
    
      'I was going to ask you whether you would come,' said Caroline, coldly.
    
    
      'If I can get my hair to lie flat by any means at all, of course!'
      returned the Countess. 'This dreadful horrid country pomade! Why did we
      not bring a larger stock of the Andalugian Regenerator? Upon my honour, my
      dear, you use a most enormous quantity; I must really tell you that.'
    
    
      Conning here entered to say that Mr. Evan had given orders for the boxes
      to be packed and everything got ready to depart by half-past eleven
      o'clock, when the fly would call for them and convey them to Fallow field
      in time to meet the coach for London.
    
    
      The Countess turned her head round to Caroline like an astonished
      automaton.
    
    
      'Given orders!' she interjected.
    
    
      'I have very little to get ready,' remarked Caroline.
    
    
      'Be so good as to wait outside the door one instant,' said the Countess to
      Conning, with particular urbanity.
    
    
      Conning heard a great deal of vigorous whispering within, and when
      summoned to re-appear, a note was handed to her to convey to Mr.
      Harrington immediately. He was on the lawn; read it, and wrote back three
      hasty lines in pencil.
    
    
      'Louisa. You have my commands to quit this house, at the hour named, this
      day. You will go with me. E. H.'
    
    
      Conning was again requested to wait outside the Countess's door. She was
      the bearer of another note. Evan read it likewise; tore it up, and said
      that there was no answer.
    
    
      The Castle of Negation held out no longer. Ruthless battalions poured over
      the walls, blew up the Countess's propriety, made frightful ravages in her
      complexion. Down fell her hair.
    
    
      'You cannot possibly go to breakfast,' said Caroline.
    
    
      'I must! I must!' cried the Countess. 'Why, my dear, if he has done
      it-wretched creature! don't you perceive that, by withholding our
      presences, we become implicated with him?' And the Countess, from a burst
      of frenzy, put this practical question so shrewdly, that Caroline's wits
      succumbed to her.
    
    
      'But he has not done it; he is acting!' she pursued, restraining her
      precious tears for higher purposes, as only true heroines can. 'Thinks to
      frighten me into submission!'
    
    
      'Do you not think Evan is right in wishing us to leave, after       after       '
      Caroline humbly suggested.
    
    
      'Say, before my venerable friend has departed this life,' the Countess
      took her up. 'No, I do not. If he is a fool, I am not. No, Carry: I do not
      jump into ditches for nothing. I will have something tangible for all that
      I have endured. We are now tailors in this place, remember. If that stigma
      is affixed to us, let us at least be remunerated for it. Come.'
    
    
      Caroline's own hard struggle demanded all her strength yet she appeared to
      hesitate. 'You will surely not disobey Evan, Louisa?'
    
    
      'Disobey?' The Countess amazedly dislocated the syllables. 'Why, the boy
      will be telling you next that he will not permit the Duke to visit you!
      Just your English order of mind, that cannot       brutes!       conceive
      of friendship between high-born men and beautiful women. Beautiful as you
      truly are, Carry, five years more will tell on you. But perhaps my dearest
      is in a hurry to return to her Maxwell? At least he thwacks well!'
    
    
      Caroline's arm was taken. The Countess loved an occasional rhyme when a
      point was to be made, and went off nodding and tripping till the time for
      stateliness arrived, near the breakfast-room door. She indeed was acting.
      At the bottom of her heart there was a dismal rage of passions: hatred of
      those who would or might look tailor in her face: terrors concerning the
      possible re-visitation of the vengeful Sir Abraham: dread of Evan and the
      efforts to despise him: the shocks of many conflicting elements. Above it
      all her countenance was calmly, sadly sweet: even as you may behold some
      majestic lighthouse glimmering over the tumult of a midnight sea.
    
    
      An unusual assemblage honoured the breakfast that morning. The news of
      Mrs. Bonner's health was more favourable. How delighted was the Countess
      to hear that! Mrs. Bonner was the only firm ground she stood on there, and
      after receiving and giving gentle salutes, she talked of Mrs. Bonner, and
      her night-watch by the sick bed, in a spirit of doleful hope. This passed
      off the moments till she could settle herself to study faces. Decidedly,
      every lady present looked glum, with the single exception of Miss Current.
      Evan was by Lady Jocelyn's side. Her ladyship spoke to him; but the
      Countess observed that no one else did. To herself, however, the gentlemen
      were as attentive as ever. Evan sat three chairs distant from her.
    
    
      If the traitor expected his sister to share in his disgrace, by noticing
      him, he was in error. On the contrary, the Countess joined the conspiracy
      to exclude him, and would stop a mild laugh if perchance he looked up.
      Presently Rose entered. She said 'Good morning' to one or two, and glided
      into a seat.
    
    
      That Evan was under Lady Jocelyn's protection soon became generally
      apparent, and also that her ladyship was angry: an exhibition so rare with
      her that it was the more remarked. Rose could see that she was a culprit
      in her mother's eyes. She glanced from Evan to her. Lady Jocelyn's mouth
      shut hard. The girl's senses then perceived the something that was afloat
      at the table; she thought with a pang of horror: 'Has Juliana told?'
      Juliana smiled on her; but the aspect of Mrs. Shorne, and of Miss
      Carrington, spoke for their knowledge of that which must henceforth be the
      perpetual reproof to her headstrong youth.
    
    
      'At what hour do you leave us?' said Lady Jocelyn to Evan.
    
    
      'When I leave the table, my lady. The fly will call for my sisters at
      half-past eleven.'
    
    
      'There is no necessity for you to start in advance?'
    
    
      'I am going over to see my mother.'
    
    
      Rose burned to speak to him now. Oh! why had she delayed! Why had she
      swerved from her good rule of open, instant explanations? But Evan's heart
      was stern to his love. Not only had she, by not coming, shown her doubt of
      him,       she had betrayed him!
    
    
      Between the Countess, Melville, Sir John, and the Duke, an animated
      dialogue was going on, over which Miss Current played like a lively iris.
      They could not part with the Countess. Melville said he should be left
      stranded, and numerous pretty things were uttered by other gentlemen: by
      the women not a word. Glancing from certain of them lingeringly to her
      admirers, the Countess smiled her thanks, and then Andrew, pressed to
      remain, said he was willing and happy, and so forth; and it seemed that
      her admirers had prevailed over her reluctance, for the Countess ended her
      little protests with a vanquished bow. Then there was a gradual rising
      from table. Evan pressed Lady Jocelyn's hand, and turning from her bent
      his head to Sir Franks, who, without offering an exchange of cordialities,
      said, at arm's length: 'Good-bye, sir.' Melville also gave him that
      greeting stiffly. Harry was perceived to rush to the other end of the
      room, in quest of a fly apparently. Poor Caroline's heart ached for her
      brother, to see him standing there in the shadow of many faces. But he was
      not left to stand alone. Andrew quitted the circle of Sir John, Seymour
      Jocelyn, Mr. George Uplift, and others, and linked his arm to Evan's. Rose
      had gone. While Evan looked for her despairingly to say his last word and
      hear her voice once more, Sir Franks said to his wife:
    
    
      'See that Rose keeps up-stairs.'
    
    
      'I want to speak to her,' was her ladyship's answer, and she moved to the
      door.
    
    
      Evan made way for her, bowing.
    
    
      'You will be ready at half-past eleven, Louisa,' he said, with calm
      distinctness, and passed from that purgatory.
    
    
      Now honest Andrew attributed the treatment Evan met with to the exposure
      of yesterday. He was frantic with democratic disgust.
    
    
      'Why the devil don't they serve me like that; eh? 'Cause I got a few
      coppers! There, Van! I'm a man of peace; but if you'll call any man of 'em
      out I'll stand your second       'pon my soul, I will. They must be
      cowards, so there isn't much to fear. Confound the fellows, I tell 'em
      every day I'm the son of a cobbler, and egad, they grow civiller. What do
      they mean? Are cobblers ranked over tailors?'
    
    
      'Perhaps that's it,' said Evan.
    
    
      'Hang your gentlemen!' Andrew cried.
    
    
      'Let us have breakfast first,' uttered a melancholy voice near them in the
      passage.
    
    
      'Jack!' said Evan. 'Where have you been?'
    
    
      'I didn't know the breakfast-room,' Jack returned, 'and the fact is, my
      spirits are so down, I couldn't muster up courage to ask one of the
      footmen. I delivered your letter. Nothing hostile took place. I bowed
      fiercely to let him know what he might expect. That generally stops it.
      You see, I talk prose. I shall never talk anything else!'
    
    
      Andrew recommenced his jests of yesterday with Jack. The latter bore them
      patiently, as one who had endured worse.
    
    
      'She has rejected me!' he whispered to Evan. 'Talk of the ingratitude of
      women! Ten minutes ago I met her. She perked her eyebrows at me!       tried
      to run away. "Miss Wheedle": I said. "If you please, I 'd rather not,"
      says she. To cut it short, the sacrifice I made to her was the cause. It's
      all over the house. She gave the most excruciating hint. Those low-born
      females are so horribly indelicate. I stood confounded. Commending his new
      humour, Evan persuaded him to breakfast immediately, and hunger being one
      of Jack's solitary incitements to a sensible course of conduct, the
      disconsolate gentleman followed its dictates. 'Go with him, Andrew,' said
      Evan. 'He is here as my friend, and may be made uncomfortable.'
    
    
      'Yes, yes,       ha! ha! I'll follow the poor chap,' said Andrew. 'But
      what is it all about? Louisa won't go, you know. Has the girl given you up
      because she saw your mother, Van? I thought it was all right. Why the
      deuce are you running away?'
    
    
      'Because I've just seen that I ought never to have come, I suppose,' Evan
      replied, controlling the wretched heaving of his chest.
    
    
      'But Louisa won't go, Van.'
    
    
      'Understand, my dear Andrew, that I know it to be quite imperative. Be
      ready yourself with Caroline. Louisa will then make her choice. Pray help
      me in this. We must not stay a minute more than is necessary in this
      house.'
    
    
      'It's an awful duty,' breathed Andrew, after a pause. 'I see nothing but
      hot water at home. Why       but it's no use asking questions. My love to
      your mother. I say, Van,       now isn't Lady Jocelyn a trump?'
    
    
      'God bless her!' said Evan. And the moisture in Andrew's eyes affected his
      own.
    
    
      'She's the staunchest piece of woman-goods I ever       I know a hundred
      cases of her!'
    
    
      'I know one, and that 's enough,' said Evan.
    
    
      Not a sign of Rose! Can Love die without its dear farewell on which it
      feeds, away from the light, dying by bits? In Evan's heart Love seemed to
      die, and all the pangs of a death were there as he trod along the gravel
      and stepped beneath the gates of Beckley Court.
    
    
      Meantime the gallant Countess was not in any way disposed to retreat on
      account of Evan's defection. The behaviour toward him at the
      breakfast-table proved to her that he had absolutely committed his
      egregious folly, and as no General can have concert with a fool, she cut
      him off from her affections resolutely. Her manifest disdain at his last
      speech, said as much to everybody present. Besides, the lady was in her
      element here, and compulsion is required to make us relinquish our
      element. Lady Jocelyn certainly had not expressly begged of her to remain:
      the Countess told Melville so, who said that if she required such an
      invitation she should have it, but that a guest to whom they were so much
      indebted, was bound to spare them these formalities.
    
    
      'What am I to do?'
    
    
      The Countess turned piteously to the diplomatist's wife.
    
    
      She answered, retiringly: 'Indeed I cannot say.'
    
    
      Upon this, the Countess accepted Melville's arm, and had some thoughts of
      punishing the woman.
    
    
      They were seen parading the lawn. Mr. George Uplift chuckled singularly.
    
    
      'Just the old style,' he remarked, but corrected the inadvertence with a
      'hem!' committing himself more shamefully the instant after. 'I'll wager
      she has the old Dip. down on his knee before she cuts.'
    
    
      'Bet can't be taken,' observed Sir John Loring. 'It requires a spy.'
    
    
      Harry, however, had heard the remark, and because he wished to speak to
      her, let us hope, and reproach her for certain things when she chose to be
      disengaged, he likewise sallied out, being forlorn as a youth whose sweet
      vanity is much hurt.
    
    
      The Duke had paired off with Mrs. Strike. The lawn was fair in sunlight
      where they walked. The air was rich with harvest smells, and the scent of
      autumnal roses. Caroline was by nature luxurious and soft. The thought of
      that drilled figure to which she was returning in bondage, may have thrown
      into bright relief the polished and gracious nobleman who walked by her
      side, shadowing forth the chances of a splendid freedom. Two lovely tears
      fell from her eyes. The Duke watched them quietly.
    
    
      'Do you know, they make me jealous?' he said.
    
    
      Caroline answered him with a faint smile.
    
    
      'Reassure me, my dear lady; you are not going with your brother this
      morning?'
    
    
      'Your Grace, I have no choice!'
    
    
      'May I speak to you as your warmest friend? From what I hear, it appears
      to be right that your brother should not stay. To the best of my ability I
      will provide for him: but I sincerely desire to disconnect you from those
      who are unworthy of you. Have you not promised to trust in me? Pray, let
      me be your guide.'
    
    
      Caroline replied to the heart of his words: 'I dare not.'
    
    
      'What has changed you?'
    
    
      'I am not changed, but awakened,' said Caroline.
    
    
      The Duke paced on in silence.
    
    
      'Pardon me if I comprehend nothing of such a change,' he resumed. 'I asked
      you to sacrifice much; all that I could give in return I offered. Is it
      the world you fear?'
    
    
      'What is the world to such as I am?'
    
    
      'Can you consider it a duty to deliver yourself bound to that man again?'
    
    
      'Heaven pardon me, my lord, I think of that too little!'
    
    
      The Duke's next question: 'Then what can it be?' stood in his eyes.
    
    
      'Oh!' Caroline's touch quivered on his arm, 'Do not suppose me frivolous,
      ungrateful, or       or cowardly. For myself you have offered more
      happiness than I could have hoped for. To be allied to one so generous, I
      could bear anything. Yesterday you had my word: give it me back to-day!'
    
    
      Very curiously the Duke gazed on her, for there was evidence of internal
      torture across her forehead.
    
    
      'I may at least beg to know the cause for this request?'
    
    
      She quelled some throbbing in her bosom. 'Yes.'
    
    
      He waited, and she said: 'There is one       if I offended him, I could
      not live. If now I followed my wishes, he would lose his faith in the last
      creature that loves him. He is unhappy. I could bear what is called
      disgrace, my lord       I shudder to say it       I could sin against
      heaven; but I dare not do what would make him despise me.'
    
    
      She was trembling violently; yet the nobleman, in his surprise, could not
      forbear from asking who this person might be, whose influence on her
      righteous actions was so strong.
    
    
      'It is my brother, my lord,' she said.
    
    
      Still more astonished, 'Your brother!' the Duke exclaimed. 'My dearest
      lady, I would not wound you; but is not this a delusion? We are so placed
      that we must speak plainly. Your brother I have reason to feel sure is
      quite unworthy of you.'
    
    
      'Unworthy? My brother Evan? Oh! he is noble, he is the best of men!'
    
    
      'And how, between yesterday and to-day, has he changed you?'
    
    
      'It is that yesterday I did not know him, and to-day I do.'
    
    
      Her brother, a common tradesman, a man guilty of forgery and the utmost
      baseness       all but kicked out of the house! The Duke was too delicate
      to press her further. Moreover, Caroline had emphasized the 'yesterday'
      and 'to-day,' showing that the interval which had darkened Evan to
      everybody else, had illumined him to her. He employed some courtly
      eloquence, better unrecorded; but if her firm resolution perplexed him, it
      threw a strange halo round the youth from whom it sprang.
    
    
      The hour was now eleven, and the Countess thought it full time to retire
      to her entrenchment in Mrs. Bonner's chamber. She had great things still
      to do: vast designs were in her hand awaiting the sanction of Providence.
      Alas! that little idle promenade was soon to be repented. She had joined
      her sister, thinking it safer to have her upstairs till they were quit of
      Evan. The Duke and the diplomatist loitering in the rear, these two fair
      women sailed across the lawn, conscious, doubtless, over all their sorrows
      and schemes, of the freight of beauty they carried.
    
    
      What meant that gathering on the steps? It was fortuitous, like everything
      destined to confound us. There stood Lady Jocelyn with Andrew, fretting
      his pate. Harry leant against a pillar, Miss Carrington, Mrs. Shorne, and
      Mrs. Melville, supported by Mr. George Uplift, held watchfully by.
      Juliana, with Master Alec and Miss Dorothy, were in the background.
    
    
      Why did our General see herself cut off from her stronghold, as by a
      hostile band? She saw it by that sombre light in Juliana's eyes, which had
      shown its ominous gleam whenever disasters were on the point of unfolding.
    
    
      Turning to Caroline, she said: 'Is there a back way?'
    
    
      Too late! Andrew called.
    
    
      'Come along, Louisa, Just time, and no more. Carry, are you packed?'
    
    
      This in reality was the first note of the retreat from Beckley; and having
      blown it, the hideous little trumpeter burst into scarlet perspirations,
      mumbling to Lady Jocelyn: 'Now, my lady, mind you stand by me.'
    
    
      The Countess walked straight up to him.
    
    
      'Dear Andrew! this sun is too powerful for you. I beg you, withdraw into
      the shade of the house.'
    
    
      She was about to help him with all her gentleness.
    
    
      'Yes, yes. All right, Louisa rejoined Andrew. 'Come, go and pack. The fly
      'll be here, you know       too late for the coach, if you don't mind, my
      lass. Ain't you packed yet?'
    
    
      The horrible fascination of vulgarity impelled the wretched lady to
      answer: 'Are we herrings?' And then she laughed, but without any
      accompaniment.
    
    
      'I am now going to dear Mrs. Bonner,' she said, with a tender glance at
      Lady Jocelyn.
    
    
      'My mother is sleeping,' her ladyship remarked.
    
    
      'Come, Carry, my darling!' cried Andrew.
    
    
      Caroline looked at her sister. The Countess divined Andrew's shameful
      trap.
    
    
      'I was under an engagement to go and canvass this afternoon,' she said.
    
    
      'Why, my dear Louisa, we've settled that in here this morning,' said
      Andrew. 'Old Tom only stuck up a puppet to play with. We've knocked him
      over, and march in victorious       eh, my lady?'
    
    
      'Oh!' exclaimed the Countess, 'if Mr. Raikes shall indeed have listened to
      my inducements!'
    
    
      'Deuce a bit of inducements!' returned Andrew. 'The fellow's ashamed of
      himself-ha! ha! Now then, Louisa.'
    
    
      While they talked, Juliana had loosed Dorothy and Alec, and these imps
      were seen rehearsing a remarkable play, in which the damsel held forth a
      hand and the cavalier advanced and kissed it with a loud smack, being at
      the same time reproached for his lack of grace.
    
    
      'You are so English!' cried Dorothy, with perfect languor, and a malicious
      twitter passed between two or three. Mr. George spluttered indiscreetly.
    
    
      The Countess observed the performance. Not to convert the retreat into a
      total rout, she, with that dark flush which was her manner of blushing,
      took formal leave of Lady Jocelyn, who, in return, simply said: 'Good-bye,
      Countess.' Mrs. Strike's hand she kindly shook.
    
    
      The few digs and slaps and thrusts at gloomy Harry and prim Miss
      Carrington and boorish Mr. George, wherewith the Countess, torn with
      wrath, thought it necessary to cover her retreat, need not be told. She
      struck the weak alone: Juliana she respected. Masterly tactics, for they
      showed her power, gratified her vengeance, and left her unassailed. On the
      road she had Andrew to tear to pieces. O delicious operation! And O
      shameful brother to reduce her to such joys! And, O Providence! may a poor
      desperate soul, betrayed through her devotion, unremunerated for her
      humiliation and absolute hard work, accuse thee? The Countess would have
      liked to. She felt it to be the instigation of the devil, and decided to
      remain on the safe side still.
    
    
      Happily for Evan, she was not ready with her packing by half-past eleven.
      It was near twelve when he, pacing in front of the inn, observed Polly
      Wheedle, followed some yards in the rear by John Raikes, advancing towards
      him. Now Polly had been somewhat delayed by Jack's persecutions, and Evan
      declining to attend to the masked speech of her mission, which directed
      him to go at once down a certain lane in the neighbourhood of the park,
      some minutes were lost.
    
    
      'Why, Mr. Harrington,' said Polly, 'it's Miss Rose: she's had leave from
      her Ma. Can you stop away, when it's quite proper?'
    
    
      Evan hesitated. Before he could conquer the dark spirit, lo, Rose
      appeared, walking up the village street. Polly and her adorer fell back.
    
    
      Timidly, unlike herself, Rose neared him.
    
    
      'I have offended you, Evan. You would not come to me: I have come to you.'
    
    
      'I am glad to be able to say good-bye to you, Rose,' was his pretty
      response.
    
    
      Could she have touched his hand then, the blood of these lovers rushing to
      one channel must have made all clear. At least he could hardly have struck
      her true heart with his miserable lie. But that chance was lost they were
      in the street, where passions have no play.
    
    
      'Tell me, Evan,       it is not true.'
    
    
      He, refining on his misery, thought, She would not ask it if she trusted
      me: and answered her: 'You have heard it from your mother, Rose.'
    
    
      'But I will not believe it from any lips but yours, Evan. Oh, speak,
      speak!'
    
    
      It pleased him to think: How could one who loved me believe it even then?
    
    
      He said: 'It can scarcely do good to make me repeat it, Rose.'
    
    
      And then, seeing her dear bosom heave quickly, he was tempted to fall on
      his knees to her with a wild outcry of love. The chance was lost. The
      inexorable street forbade it.
    
    
      There they stood in silence, gasping at the barrier that divided them.
    
    
      Suddenly a noise was heard. 'Stop! stop!' cried the voice of John Raikes.
      'When a lady and gentleman are talking together, sir, do you lean your
      long ears over them       ha?'
    
    
      Looking round, Evan beheld Laxley a step behind, and Jack rushing up to
      him, seizing his collar, and instantly undergoing ignominious prostration
      for his heroic defence of the privacy of lovers.
    
    
      'Stand aside'; said Laxley, imperiously. 'Rosey so you've come for me.
      Take my arm. You are under my protection.'
    
    
      Another forlorn 'Is it true?' Rose cast toward Evan with her eyes. He
      wavered under them.
    
    
      'Did you receive my letter?' he demanded of Laxley.
    
    
      'I decline to hold converse with you,' said Laxley, drawing Rose's hand on
      his arm.
    
    
      'You will meet me to-day or to-morrow?'
    
    
      'I am in the habit of selecting my own company.'
    
    
      Rose disengaged her hand. Evan grasped it. No word of farewell was
      uttered. Her mouth moved, but her eyes were hard shut, and nothing save
      her hand's strenuous pressure, equalling his own, told that their parting
      had been spoken, the link violently snapped.
    
    
      Mr. John Raikes had been picked up and pulled away by Polly. She now
      rushed to Evan: 'Good-bye, and God bless you, dear Mr. Harrington. I'll
      find means of letting you know how she is. And he shan't have her, mind!'
    
    
      Rose was walking by Laxley's side, but not leaning on his arm. Evan
      blessed her for this. Ere she was out of sight the fly rolled down the
      street. She did not heed it, did not once turn her head. Ah, bitter
      unkindness!
    
    
      When Love is hurt, it is self-love that requires the opiate. Conning gave
      it him in the form of a note in a handwriting not known to him. It said:
    

     'I do not believe it, and nothing will ever make me.
                    'JULIANA.'

    
      Evan could not forget these words. They coloured his farewell to Beckley:
      the dear old downs, the hopgardens, the long grey farms walled with
      clipped yew, the home of his lost love! He thought of them through weary
      nights when the ghostly image with the hard shut eyelids and the quivering
      lips would rise and sway irresolutely in air till a shape out of the
      darkness extinguished it. Pride is the God of Pagans. Juliana had honoured
      his God. The spirit of Juliana seemed to pass into the body of Rose, and
      suffer for him as that ghostly image visibly suffered.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XXXVIII. IN WHICH WE HAVE TO SEE IN THE DARK
    
    
      So ends the fourth act of our comedy.
    
    
      After all her heroism and extraordinary efforts, after, as she feared,
      offending Providence       after facing Tailordom       the Countess was
      rolled away in a dingy fly unrewarded even by a penny, for what she had
      gone through. For she possessed eminently the practical nature of her sex;
      and though she would have scorned, and would have declined to handle coin
      so base, its absence was upbraidingly mentioned in her spiritual outcries.
      Not a penny!
    
    
      Nor was there, as in the miseries of retreat she affected indifferently to
      imagine, a Duke fished out of the ruins of her enterprise, to wash the mud
      off her garments and edge them with radiance. Caroline, it became clear to
      her, had been infected by Evan's folly. Caroline, she subsequently learnt,
      had likewise been a fool. Instead of marvelling at the genius that had
      done so much in spite of the pair of fools that were the right and left
      wing of her battle array, the simple-minded lady wept. She wanted success,
      not genius. Admiration she was ever ready to forfeit for success.
    
    
      Nor did she say to the tailors of earth: 'Weep, for I sought to emancipate
      you from opprobrium by making one of you a gentleman; I fought for a great
      principle and have failed.' Heroic to the end, she herself shed all the
      tears; took all the sorrow.
    
    
      Where was consolation? Would any Protestant clergyman administer comfort
      to her? Could he? might he do so? He might listen, and quote texts; but he
      would demand the harsh rude English for everything; and the Countess's
      confessional thoughts were all innuendoish, aerial; too delicate to live
      in our shameless tongue. Confession by implication, and absolution; she
      could know this to be what she wished for, and yet not think it. She could
      see a haven of peace in that picture of the little brown box with the
      sleekly reverend figure bending his ear to the kneeling Beauty outside,
      thrice ravishing as she half-lifts the veil of her sins and her visage!       yet
      she started alarmed to hear it whispered that the fair penitent was the
      Countess de Saldar; urgently she prayed that no disgraceful brother might
      ever drive her to that!
    
    
      Never let it be a Catholic priest!       she almost fashioned her petition
      into words. Who was to save her? Alas! alas! in her dire distress       in
      her sense of miserable pennilessness, she clung to Mr. John Raikes, of the
      curricle, the mysteriously rich young gentleman; and on that picture, with
      Andrew roguishly contemplating it, and Evan, with feelings regarding his
      sister that he liked not to own, the curtain commiseratingly drops.
    
    
      As in the course of a stream you come upon certain dips, where, but here
      and there, a sparkle or a gloom of the full flowing water is caught
      through deepening foliage, so the history that concerns us wanders out of
      day for a time, and we must violate the post and open written leaves to
      mark the turn it takes.
    
    
      First we have a letter from Mr. Goren to Mrs. Mel, to inform her that her
      son has arrived and paid his respects to his future instructor in the
      branch of science practised by Mr. Goren.
    
    
      'He has arrived at last,' says the worthy tradesman. 'His appearance in
      the shop will be highly gentlemanly, and when he looks a little more
      pleasing, and grows fond of it, nothing will be left to be desired. The
      ladies, his sisters, have not thought proper to call. I had hopes of the
      custom of Mr. Andrew Cogglesby. Of course you wish him to learn tailoring
      thoroughly?'
    
    
      Mrs. Mel writes back, thanking Mr. Goren, and saying that 'she had shown
      the letter to inquiring creditors, and that she does wish her son to learn
      his business from the root. This produces a second letter from Mr. Goren,
      which imparts to her that at the root of the tree, of tailoring the
      novitiate must sit no less than six hours a day with his legs crossed and
      doubled under him, cheerfully plying needle and thread; and that, without
      this probation, to undergo which the son resolutely objects, all hope of
      his climbing to the top of the lofty tree, and viewing mankind from an
      eminence, must be surrendered.
    
    
      'If you do not insist, my dear Mrs. Harrington, I tell you candidly, your
      son may have a shop, but he will be no tailor.'
    
    
      Mrs. Mel understands her son and his state of mind well enough not to
      insist, and is resigned to the melancholy consequence.
    
    
      Then Mr. Goren discovers an extraordinary resemblance between Evan and his
      father: remarking merely that the youth is not the gentleman his father
      was in a shop, while he admits, that had it been conjoined to business
      habits, he should have envied his departed friend.
    
    
      He has soon something fresh to tell; and it is that young Mr. Harrington
      is treating him cavalierly. That he should penetrate the idea or
      appreciate the merits of Mr. Goren's Balance was hardly to be expected at
      present: the world did not, and Mr. Goren blamed no young man for his
      ignorance. Still a proper attendance was requisite. Mr. Goren thought it
      very singular that young Mr. Harrington should demand all the hours of the
      day for his own purposes, up to half-past four. He found it difficult to
      speak to him as a master, and begged that Mrs. Harrington would, as a
      mother.
    
    
      The reply of Mrs. Mel is dashed with a trifle of cajolery. She has heard
      from her son, and seeing that her son takes all that time from his right
      studies, to earn money wherewith to pay debts of which Mr. Goren is
      cognizant, she trusts that their oldest friend will overlook it.
    
    
      Mr. Goren rejoins that he considers that he need not have been excluded
      from young Mr. Harrington's confidence. Moreover, it is a grief to him
      that the young gentleman should refrain from accepting any of his
      suggestions as to the propriety of requesting some, at least, of his rich
      and titled acquaintance to confer on him the favour of their patronage.
      'Which they would not repent,' adds Mr. Goren, 'and might learn to be very
      much obliged to him for, in return for kindnesses extended to him.'
    
    
      Notwithstanding all my efforts, you see, the poor boy is thrust into the
      shop. There he is, without a doubt. He sleeps under Mr. Goren's roof: he
      (since one cannot be too positive in citing the punishment of such a
      Pagan) stands behind a counter: he (and, oh! choke, young loves, that have
      hovered around him! shrink from him in natural horror, gentle ladies!)
      handles the shears. It is not my fault. He would be a Pagan. If you can
      think him human enough still to care to know how he feels it, I must tell
      you that he feels it hardly-at all. After a big blow, a very little one
      scarcely counts. What are outward forms and social ignominies to him whose
      heart has been struck to the dust? His Gods have fought for him, and there
      he is! He deserves no pity.
    
    
      But he does not ask it of you, the callous Pagan! Despise him, if you
      please, and rank with the Countess, who despises him most heartily.
      Dipping further into the secrets of the post, we discover a brisk
      correspondence between Juliana Bonner and Mrs. Strike.
    
    
      'A thousand thanks to you, my dear Miss Bonner,' writes the latter lady.
      'The unaffected interest you take in my brother touches me deeply. I know
      him to be worthy of your good opinion. Yes, I will open my heart to you,
      dearest Juliana; and it shall, as you wish, be quite secret between us.
      Not to a soul!
    
    
      'He is quite alone. My sisters Harriet and Louisa will not see him, and I
      can only do so by stealth. His odd other little friend sometimes drives me
      out on Sundays, to a place where I meet him; and the Duke of Belfield
      kindly lends me his carriage. Oh, that we might never part! I am only
      happy with him!
    
    
      'Ah, do not doubt him, Juliana, for anything he does! You say, that now
      the Duke has obtained for him the Secretaryship to my husband's Company,
      he should not thing, and you do not understand why. I will tell you. Our
      poor father died in debt, and Evan receives money which enables him by
      degrees to liquidate these debts, on condition that he consents to be what
      I dislike as much as you can. He bears it; you can have no idea of his
      pride! He is too proud to own to himself that it debases him       too
      proud to complain. It is a tangle       a net that drags him down to it
      but whatever he is outwardly, he is the noblest human being in the world
      to me, and but for him, oh, what should I be? Let me beg you to forgive
      it, if you can. My darling has no friends. Is his temper as sweet as ever?
      I can answer that. Yes, only he is silent, and looks       when you look
      into his eyes       colder, as men look when they will not bear much from
      other men.
    
    
      'He has not mentioned her name. I am sure she has not written.
    
    
      'Pity him, and pray for him.'
    
    
      Juliana then makes a communication, which draws forth the following:       
    
    
      'Mistress of all the Beckley property-dearest, dearest Juliana! Oh! how
      sincerely I congratulate you! The black on the letter alarmed me so, I
      could hardly open it, my fingers trembled so; for I esteem you all at
      Beckley; but when I had opened and read it, I was recompensed. You say you
      are sorry for Rose. But surely what your Grandmama has done is quite
      right. It is just, in every sense. But why am I not to tell Evan? I am
      certain it would make him very happy, and happiness of any kind he needs
      so much! I will obey you, of course, but I cannot see why. Do you know, my
      dear child, you are extremely mysterious, and puzzle me. Evan takes a
      pleasure in speaking of you. You and Lady Jocelyn are his great themes.
      Why is he to be kept ignorant of your good fortune? The spitting of blood
      is bad. You must winter in a warm climate. I do think that London is far
      better for you in the late Autumn than Hampshire. May I ask my sister
      Harriet to invite you to reside with her for some weeks? Nothing, I know,
      would give her greater pleasure.'
    
    
      Juliana answers this       
    
    
      'If you love me       I sometimes hope that you do       but the feeling
      of being loved is so strange to me that I can only believe it at times       but,
      Caroline       there, I have mustered up courage to call you by your
      Christian name at last       Oh, dear Caroline! if you do love me, do not
      tell Mr. Harrington. I go on my knees to you to beg you not to tell him a
      word. I have no reasons indeed not any; but I implore you again never even
      to hint that I am anything but the person he knew at Beckley.
    
    
      'Rose has gone to Elburne House, where Ferdinand, her friend, is to meet
      her. She rides and sings the same, and keeps all her colour.
    
    
      'She may not, as you imagine, have much sensibility. Perhaps not enough. I
      am afraid that Rose is turning into a very worldly woman!
    
    
      'As to what you kindly say about inviting me to London, I should like it,
      and I am my own mistress. Do you know, I think I am older than your
      brother! I am twenty-three. Pray, when you write, tell me if he is older
      than that. But should I not be a dreadful burden to you? Sometimes I have
      to keep to my chamber whole days and days. When that happens now, I think
      of you entirely. See how I open my heart to you. You say that you do to
      me. I wish I could really think it.'
    
    
      A postscript begs Caroline 'not to forget about the ages.'
    
    
      In this fashion the two ladies open their hearts, and contrive to read one
      another perfectly in their mutual hypocrisies.
    
    
      Some letters bearing the signatures of Mr. John Raikes, and Miss Polly
      Wheedle, likewise pass. Polly inquires for detailed accounts of the health
      and doings of Mr. Harrington. Jack replies with full particulars of her
      own proceedings, and mild corrections of her grammar. It is to be noted
      that Polly grows much humbler to him on paper, which being instantly
      perceived by the mercurial one, his caressing condescension to her is very
      beautiful. She is taunted with Mr. Nicholas Frim, and answers, after the
      lapse of a week, that the aforesaid can be nothing to her, as he 'went in
      a passion to church last Sunday and got married.' It appears that they had
      quarrelled, 'because I danced with you that night.' To this Mr. Raikes
      rejoins in a style that would be signified by 'ahem!' in language, and an
      arrangement of the shirt collar before the looking-glass, in action.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XXXIX. IN THE DOMAIN OF TAILORDOM
    
    
      There was peace in Mr. Goren's shop. Badgered Ministers, bankrupt
      merchants, diplomatists with a headache       any of our modern grandees
      under difficulties, might have envied that peace over which Mr. Goren
      presided: and he was an enviable man. He loved his craft, he believed that
      he had not succeeded the millions of antecedent tailors in vain; and,
      excepting that trifling coquetry with shirt-fronts, viz., the red crosses,
      which a shrewd rival had very soon eclipsed by representing nymphs
      triangularly posed, he devoted himself to his business from morning to
      night; as rigid in demanding respect from those beneath him, as he was
      profuse in lavishing it on his patrons. His public boast was, that he owed
      no man a farthing; his secret comfort, that he possessed two thousand
      pounds in the Funds. But Mr. Goren did not stop here. Behind these
      external characteristics he nursed a passion. Evan was astonished and
      pleased to find in him an enthusiastic fern-collector. Not that Mr.
      Harrington shared the passion, but the sight of these brown roots spread
      out, ticketed, on the stained paper, after supper, when the shutters were
      up and the house defended from the hostile outer world; the old man poring
      over them, and naming this and that spot where, during his solitary
      Saturday afternoon and Sunday excursions, he had lighted on the rare
      samples exhibited this contrast of the quiet evening with the sordid day
      humanized Mr. Goren to him. He began to see a spirit in the rigid
      tradesman not so utterly dissimilar to his own, and he fancied that he,
      too, had a taste for ferns. Round Beckley how they abounded!
    
    
      He told Mr. Goren so, and Mr. Goren said:
    
    
      'Some day we'll jog down there together, as the saying goes.'
    
    
      Mr. Goren spoke of it as an ordinary event, likely to happen in the days
      to come: not as an incident the mere mention of which, as being probable,
      stopped the breath and made the pulses leap.
    
    
      For now Evan's education taught him to feel that he was at his lowest
      degree. Never now could Rose stoop to him. He carried the shop on his
      back. She saw the brand of it on his forehead. Well! and what was Rose to
      him, beyond a blissful memory, a star that he had once touched? Self-love
      kept him strong by day, but in the darkness of night came his misery;
      wakening from tender dreams, he would find his heart sinking under a
      horrible pressure, and then the fair fresh face of Rose swam over him; the
      hours of Beckley were revived; with intolerable anguish he saw that she
      was blameless       that he alone was to blame. Yet worse was it when his
      closed eyelids refused to conjure up the sorrowful lovely nightmare, and
      he lay like one in a trance, entombed-wretched Pagan! feeling all that had
      been blindly; when the Past lay beside him like a corpse that he had
      slain.
    
    
      These nightly torments helped him to brave what the morning brought.
      Insensibly also, as Time hardened his sufferings, Evan asked himself what
      the shame of his position consisted in. He grew stiff-necked. His Pagan
      virtues stood up one by one to support him. Andrew, courageously evading
      the interdict that forbade him to visit Evan, would meet him by
      appointment at City taverns, and flatly offered him a place in the
      Brewery. Evan declined it, on the pretext that, having received Old Tom's
      money for the year, he must at least work out that term according to the
      conditions. Andrew fumed and sneered at Tailordom. Evan said that there
      was peace in Mr. Goren's shop. His sharp senses discerned in Andrew's
      sneer a certain sincerity, and he revolted against it. Mr John Raikes,
      too, burlesqued Society so well, that he had the satisfaction of laughing
      at his enemy occasionally. The latter gentleman was still a pensioner,
      flying about town with the Countess de Saldar, in deadly fear lest that
      fascinating lady should discover the seat of his fortune; happy,
      notwithstanding. In the mirror of Evan's little world, he beheld the great
      one from which he was banished.
    
    
      Now the dusk of a winter's afternoon was closing over London, when a
      carriage drew up in front of Mr. Goren's shop, out of which, to Mr.
      Goren's chagrin, a lady stepped, with her veil down. The lady entered, and
      said that she wished to speak to Mr. Harrington. Mr. Goren made way for
      her to his pupil; and was amazed to see her fall into his arms, and hardly
      gratified to hear her say: 'Pardon me, darling, for coming to you in this
      place.'
    
    
      Evan asked permission to occupy the parlour.
    
    
      'My place,' said Mr. Goren, with humble severity, over his spectacles, 'is
      very poor. Such as it is, it is at the lady's service.'
    
    
      Alone with her, Evan was about to ease his own feelings by remarking to
      the effect that Mr. Goren was human like the rest of us, but Caroline
      cried, with unwonted vivacity:
    
    
      'Yes, yes, I know; but I thought only of you. I have such news for you!
      You will and must pardon my coming       that's my first thought,
      sensitive darling that you are!' She kissed him fondly. 'Juliana Bonner is
      in town, staying with us!'
    
    
      'Is that your news?' asked Evan, pressing her against his breast.
    
    
      'No, dear love       but still! You have no idea what her fortune       Mrs.
      Bonner has died and left her       but I mustn't tell you. Oh, my darling!
      how she admires you! She       she could recompense you; if you would! We
      will put that by, for the present. Dear! the Duke has begged you, through
      me, to accept       I think it 's to be a sort of bailiff to his estates       I
      don't know rightly. It's a very honourable post, that gentlemen take: and
      the income you are to have, Evan, will be near a thousand a year. Now,
      what do I deserve for my news?'
    
    
      She put up her mouth for another kiss, out of breath.
    
    
      'True?' looked Evan's eyes.
    
    
      'True!' she said, smiling, and feasting on his bewilderment.
    
    
      After the bubbling in his brain had a little subsided, Evan breathed as a
      man on whom fresh air is blown. Were not these tidings of release? His
      ridiculous pride must nevertheless inquire whether Caroline had been
      begging this for him.
    
    
      'No, dear       indeed!' Caroline asserted with more than natural
      vehemence. 'It's something that you yourself have done that has pleased
      him. I don't know what. Only he says, he believes you are a man to be
      trusted with the keys of anything       and so you are. You are to call on
      him to-morrow. Will you?'
    
    
      While Evan was replying, her face became white. She had heard the Major's
      voice in the shop. His military step advanced, and Caroline, exclaiming,
      'Don't let me see him!' bustled to a door. Evan nodded, and she slipped
      through. The next moment he was facing the stiff marine.
    
    
      'Well, young man,' the Major commenced, and, seating himself, added, 'be
      seated. I want to talk to you seriously, sir. You didn't think fit to wait
      till I had done with the Directors today. You're devilishly out in your
      discipline, whatever you are at two and two. I suppose there's no fear of
      being intruded on here? None of your acquaintances likely to be
      introducing themselves to me?'
    
    
      'There is not one that I would introduce to you,' said Evan.
    
    
      The Major nodded a brief recognition of the compliment, and then, throwing
      his back against the chair, fired out: 'Come, sir, is this your doing?'
    
    
      In military phrase, Evan now changed front. His first thought had been
      that the Major had come for his wife. He perceived that he himself was the
      special object of his visitation.
    
    
      'I must ask you what you allude to,' he answered.
    
    
      'You are not at your office, but you will speak to me as if there was some
      distinction between us,' said the Major. 'My having married your sister
      does not reduce me to the ranks, I hope.'
    
    
      The Major drummed his knuckles on the table, after this impressive
      delivery.
    
    
      'Hem!' he resumed. 'Now, sir, understand, before you speak a word, that I
      can see through any number of infernal lies. I see that you're prepared
      for prevarication. By George! it shall come out of you, if I get it by
      main force. The Duke compelled me to give you that appointment in my
      Company. Now, sir, did you, or did you not, go to him and deliberately
      state to him that you believed the affairs of the Company to be in a bad
      condition       infamously handled, likely to involve his honour as a
      gentleman? I ask you, sir, did you do this, or did you not do it?'
    
    
      Evan waited till the sharp rattle of the Major's close had quieted.
    
    
      'If I am to answer the wording of your statement, I may say that I did
      not.'
    
    
      'Very good; very good; that will do. Are you aware that the Duke has sent
      in his resignation as a Director of our Company?'
    
    
      'I hear of it first from you.'
    
    
      'Confound your familiarity!' cried the irritable officer, rising. 'Am I
      always to be told that I married your sister? Address me, sir, as becomes
      your duty.'
    
    
      Evan heard the words 'beggarly tailor' mumbled 'out of the gutters,' and
      'cursed connection.' He stood in the attitude of attention, while the
      Major continued:
    
    
      'Now, young man, listen to these facts. You came to me this day last week,
      and complained that you did not comprehend some of our transactions and
      affairs. I explained them to your damned stupidity. You went away. Three
      days after that, you had an interview with the Duke. Stop, sir! What the
      devil do you mean by daring to speak while I am speaking? You saw the
      Duke, I say. Now, what took place at that interview?'
    
    
      The Major tried to tower over Evan powerfully, as he put this query. They
      were of a common height, and to do so, he had to rise on his toes, so that
      the effect was but momentary.
    
    
      'I think I am not bound to reply,' said Evan.
    
    
      'Very well, sir; that will do.' The Major's fingers were evidently itching
      for an absent rattan. 'Confess it or not, you are dismissed from your
      post. Do you hear? You are kicked in the street. A beggarly tailor you
      were born, and a beggarly tailor you will die.'
    
    
      'I must beg you to stop, now,' said Evan. 'I told you that I was not bound
      to reply: but I will. If you will sit down, Major Strike, you shall hear
      what you wish to know.'
    
    
      This being presently complied with, though not before a glare of the
      Major's eyes had shown his doubt whether it might not be construed into
      insolence, Evan pursued:
    
    
      'I came to you and informed you that I could not reconcile the
      cash-accounts of the Company, and that certain of the later proceedings
      appeared to me to jeopardize its prosperity. Your explanations did not
      satisfy me. I admit that you enjoined me to be silent. But the Duke, as a
      Director, had as strong a right to claim me as his servant, and when he
      questioned me as to the position of the Company, I told him what I
      thought, just as I had told you.'
    
    
      'You told him we were jobbers and swindlers, sir!'
    
    
      'The Duke inquired of me whether I would, under the circumstances, while
      proceedings were going on which I did not approve of, take the
      responsibility of allowing my name to remain       '
    
    
      'Ha! ha! ha!' the Major burst out. This was too good a joke. The name of a
      miserable young tailor!' Go on, sir, go on!' He swallowed his laughter
      like oil on his rage.
    
    
      'I have said sufficient.'
    
    
      Jumping up, the Major swore by the Lord, that he had said sufficient.
    
    
      'Now, look you here, young man.' He squared his finger before Evan, eyeing
      him under a hard frown, 'You have been playing your game again, as you did
      down at that place in Hampshire. I heard of it       deserved to be shot,
      by heaven! You think you have got hold of the Duke, and you throw me over.
      You imagine, I dare say, that I will allow my wife to be talked about to
      further your interests       you self-seeking young dog! As long as he
      lent the Company his name, I permitted a great many things. Do you think
      me a blind idiot, sir? But now she must learn to be satisfied with people
      who 've got no titles, or carriages, and who can't give hundred guinea
      compliments. You're all of a piece-a set of...'
    
    
      The Major paused, for half a word was on his mouth which had drawn
      lightning to Evan's eyes.
    
    
      Not to be baffled, he added: 'But look you, sir. I may be ruined. I dare
      say the Company will go to the dogs       every ass will follow a Duke.
      But, mark, this goes on no more. I will be no woman's tally. Mind, sir, I
      take excellent care that you don't traffic in your sister!'
    
    
      The Major delivered this culminating remark with a well-timed deflection
      of his forefinger, and slightly turned aside when he had done.
    
    
      You might have seen Evan's figure rocking, as he stood with his eyes
      steadily levelled on his sister's husband.
    
    
      The Major, who, whatever he was, was physically no coward, did not fail to
      interpret the look, and challenge it.
    
    
      Evan walked to the door, opened it, and said, between his teeth, 'You must
      go at once.'
    
    
      'Eh, sir, eh? what's this?' exclaimed the warrior but the door was open,
      Mr. Goren was in the shop; the scandal of an assault in such a house, and
      the consequent possibility of his matrimonial alliance becoming bruited in
      the newspapers, held his arm after it had given an involuntary jerk. He
      marched through with becoming dignity, and marched out into the street;
      and if necks unelastic and heads erect may be taken as the sign of a proud
      soul and of nobility of mind, my artist has the Major for his model.
    
    
      Evan displayed no such a presence. He returned to the little parlour, shut
      and locked the door to the shop, and forgetting that one was near, sat
      down, covered his eyes, and gave way to a fit of tearless sobbing. With
      one foot in the room Caroline hung watching him. A pain that she had never
      known wrung her nerves. His whole manhood seemed to be shaken, as if by
      regular pulsations of intensest misery. She stood in awe of the sight till
      her limbs failed her, and then staggering to him she fell on her knees,
      clasping his, passionately kissing them.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XL. IN WHICH THE COUNTESS STILL SCENTS GAME
    
    
      Mr. Raikes and his friend Frank Remand, surnamed Franko, to suit the
      requirements of metre, in which they habitually conversed, were walking
      arm-in-arm along the drive in Society's Park on a fine frosty Sunday
      afternoon of midwinter. The quips and jokes of Franko were lively, and he
      looked into the carriages passing, as if he knew that a cheerful
      countenance is not without charms for their inmates. Raikes' face, on the
      contrary, was barren and bleak. Being of that nature that when a pun was
      made he must perforce outstrip it, he fell into Franko's humour from time
      to time, but albeit aware that what he uttered was good, and by comparison
      transcendent, he refused to enjoy it. Nor when Franko started from his arm
      to declaim a passage, did he do other than make limp efforts to unite
      himself to Franko again. A further sign of immense depression in him was
      that instead of the creative, it was the critical faculty he exercised,
      and rather than reply to Franko in his form of speech, he scanned
      occasional lines and objected to particular phrases. He had clearly
      exchanged the sanguine for the bilious temperament, and was fast stranding
      on the rocky shores of prose. Franko bore this very well, for he, like
      Raikes in happier days, claimed all the glances of lovely woman as his
      own, and on his right there flowed a stream of Beauties. At last he was
      compelled to observe: 'This change is sudden: wherefore so downcast? With
      tigrine claw thou mangiest my speech, thy cheeks are like December's
      pippin, and thy tongue most sour!'
    
    
      'Then of it make a farce!' said Raikes, for the making of farces was
      Franko's profession. 'Wherefore so downcast! What a line! There! let's
      walk on. Let us the left foot forward stout advance. I care not for the
      herd.'
    
    
      ''Tis love!' cried Franko.
    
    
      'Ay, an' it be!' Jack gloomily returned.
    
    
      'For ever cruel is the sweet Saldar?'
    
    
      Raikes winced at this name.
    
    
      'A truce to banter, Franko!' he said sternly: but the subject was opened,
      and the wound.
    
    
      'Love!' he pursued, mildly groaning. 'Suppose you adored a fascinating
      woman, and she knew       positively knew       your manly weakness, and
      you saw her smiling upon everybody, and she told you to be happy, and
      egad, when you came to reflect, you found that after three months' suit
      you were nothing better than her errand-boy? A thing to boast of, is it
      not, quotha?'
    
    
      'Love's yellow-fever, jealousy, methinks,' Franko commenced in reply; but
      Raikes spat at the emphasized word.
    
    
      'Jealousy!       who's jealous of clergymen and that crew? Not I, by
      Pluto! I carried five messages to one fellow with a coat-tail straight to
      his heels, last week. She thought I should drive my curricle       I
      couldn't afford an omnibus! I had to run. When I returned to her I was
      dirty. She made remarks!'
    
    
      'Thy sufferings are severe       but such is woman!' said Franko. 'Gad,
      it's a good idea, though.' He took out a note-book and pencilled down a
      point or two. Raikes watched the process sardonically.
    
    
      'My tragedy is, then, thy farce!' he exclaimed. 'Well, be it so! I believe
      I shall come to song-writing again myself shortly-beneath the shield of
      Catnach I'll a nation's ballads frame. I've spent my income in four
      months, and now I 'm living on my curricle. I underlet it. It 's like
      trade       it 's as bad as poor old Harrington, by Jove! But that isn't
      the worst, Franko!' Jack dropped his voice: 'I believe I'm furiously loved
      by a poor country wench.'
    
    
      'Morals!' was Franko's most encouraging reproof.
    
    
      'Oh, I don't think I've even kissed her,' rejoined Raikes, who doubted
      because his imagination was vivid. 'It 's my intellect that dazzles her. I
      've got letters       she calls me clever. By Jove! since I gave up
      driving I've had thoughts of rushing down to her and making her mine in
      spite of home, family, fortune, friends, name, position       everything!
      I have, indeed.'
    
    
      Franko looked naturally astonished at this amount of self-sacrifice. 'The
      Countess?' he shrewdly suggested.
    

       'I'd rather be my Polly's prince,
        Than yon great lady's errand-boy!'

    
      Raikes burst into song.
    
    
      He stretched out his hand, as if to discard all the great ladies who were
      passing. By the strangest misfortune ever known, the direction taken by
      his fingers was toward a carriage wherein, beautifully smiling opposite an
      elaborately reverend gentleman of middle age, the Countess de Saldar was
      sitting. This great lady is not to be blamed for deeming that her
      errand-boy was pointing her out vulgarly on a public promenade. Ineffable
      disdain curled off her sweet olive visage. She turned her head.
    
    
      'I 'll go down to that girl to-night,' said Raikes, with compressed
      passion. And then he hurried Franko along to the bridge, where, behold,
      the Countess alighted with the gentleman, and walked beside him into the
      gardens.
    
    
      'Follow her,' said Raikes, in agitation. 'Do you see her? by yon
      long-tailed raven's side? Follow her, Franko! See if he kisses her
      hand-anything! and meet me here in half an hour. I'll have evidence!'
    
    
      Franko did not altogether like the office, but Raikes' dinners, singular
      luck, and superiority in the encounter of puns, gave him the upper hand
      with his friend, and so Franko went.
    
    
      Turning away from the last glimpse of his Countess, Raikes crossed the
      bridge, and had not strolled far beneath the bare branches of one of the
      long green walks, when he perceived a gentleman with two ladies leaning on
      him.
    
    
      'Now, there,' moralized this youth; 'now, what do you say to that? Do you
      call that fair? He can't be happy, and it's not in nature for them to be
      satisfied. And yet, if I went up and attempted to please them all by
      taking one away, the probabilities are that he would knock me down. Such
      is life! We won't be made comfortable!'
    
    
      Nevertheless, he passed them with indifference, for it was merely the
      principle he objected to; and, indeed, he was so wrapped in his own
      conceptions, that his name had to be called behind him twice before he
      recognized Evan Harrington, Mrs. Strike, and Miss Bonner. The arrangement
      he had previously thought good, was then spontaneously adopted. Mrs.
      Strike reposed her fair hand upon his arm, and Juliana, with a timid
      glance of pleasure, walked ahead in Evan's charge. Close neighbourhood
      between the couples was not kept. The genius of Mr. Raikes was wasted in
      manoeuvres to lead his beautiful companion into places where he could be
      seen with her, and envied. It was, perhaps, more flattering that she
      should betray a marked disposition to prefer solitude in his society. But
      this idea illumined him only near the moment of parting. Then he saw it;
      then he groaned in soul, and besought Evan to have one more promenade,
      saying, with characteristic cleverness in the masking of his real
      thoughts: 'It gives us an appetite, you know.'
    
    
      In Evan's face and Juliana's there was not much sign that any protraction
      of their walk together would aid this beneficent process of nature. He
      took her hand gently, and when he quitted it, it dropped.
    
    
      'The Rose, the Rose of Beckley Court!' Raikes sang aloud. 'Why, this is a
      day of meetings. Behold John Thomas in the rear-a tower of plush and
      powder! Shall I rush-shall I pluck her from the aged stem?'
    
    
      On the gravel-walk above them Rose passed with her aristocratic
      grandmother, muffled in furs. She marched deliberately, looking coldly
      before her. Evan's face was white, and Juliana, whose eyes were fixed on
      him, shuddered.
    
    
      'I'm chilled,' she murmured to Caroline. 'Let us go.' Caroline eyed Evan
      with a meaning sadness.
    
    
      'We will hurry to our carriage,' she said.
    
    
      They were seen to make a little circuit so as not to approach Rose; after
      whom, thoughtless of his cruelty, Evan bent his steps slowly, halting when
      she reached her carriage. He believed       rather, he knew that she had
      seen him. There was a consciousness in the composed outlines of her face
      as she passed: the indifference was too perfect. Let her hate him if she
      pleased. It recompensed him that the air she wore should make her
      appearance more womanly; and that black dress and crape-bonnet, in some
      way, touched him to mournful thoughts of her that helped a partial
      forgetfulness of wounded self.
    
    
      Rose had driven off. He was looking at the same spot, where Caroline's
      hand waved from her carriage. Juliana was not seen. Caroline requested her
      to nod to him once, but she would not. She leaned back hiding her eyes,
      and moving a petulant shoulder at Caroline's hand.
    
    
      'Has he offended you, my child?'
    
    
      Juliana answered harshly:
    
    
      'No-no.'
    
    
      The wheels rolled on, and Caroline tried other subjects, knowing possibly
      that they would lead Juliana back to this of her own accord.
    
    
      'You saw how she treated him?' the latter presently said, without moving
      her hand from before her eyes.
    
    
      'Yes, dear. He forgives her, and will forget it.'
    
    
      'Oh!' she clenched her long thin hand, 'I pray that I may not die before I
      have made her repent it. She shall!'
    
    
      Juliana looked glitteringly in Caroline's face, and then fell a-weeping,
      and suffered herself to be folded and caressed. The storm was long
      subsiding.
    
    
      'Dearest! you are better now?' said Caroline.
    
    
      She whispered: 'Yes.'
    
    
      'My brother has only to know you, dear       '
    
    
      'Hush! That's past.' Juliana stopped her; and, on a deep breath that
      threatened to break to sobs, she added in a sweeter voice than was common
      to her, 'Ah, why       why did you tell him about the Beckley property?'
    
    
      Caroline vainly strove to deny that she had told him. Juliana's head shook
      mournfully at her; and now Caroline knew what Juliana meant when she
      begged so earnestly that Evan should be kept ignorant of her change of
      fortune.
    
    
      Some days after this the cold struck Juliana's chest, and she sickened.
      The three sisters held a sitting to consider what it was best to do with
      her. Caroline proposed to take her to Beckley without delay. Harriet was
      of opinion that the least they could do was to write to her relatives and
      make them instantly aware of her condition.
    
    
      But the Countess said 'No,' to both. Her argument was, that Juliana being
      independent, they were by no means bound to 'bundle' her, in her state,
      back to a place where she had been so shamefully maltreated: that here she
      would live, while there she would certainly die: that absence of
      excitement was her medicine, and that here she had it. Mrs. Andrew,
      feeling herself responsible as the young lady's hostess, did not acquiesce
      in the Countess's views till she had consulted Juliana; and then apologies
      for giving trouble were breathed on the one hand; sympathy, condolences,
      and professions of esteem, on the other. Juliana said, she was but
      slightly ill, would soon recover. Entreated not to leave them before she
      was thoroughly re-established, and to consent to be looked on as one of
      the family, she sighed, and said it was the utmost she could hope. Of
      course the ladies took this compliment to themselves, but Evan began to
      wax in importance. The Countess thought it nearly time to acknowledge him,
      and supported the idea by a citation of the doctrine, that to forgive is
      Christian. It happened, however, that Harriet, who had less art and more
      will than her sisters, was inflexible. She, living in a society but a few
      steps above Tailordom, however magnificent in expenditure and resources,
      abhorred it solemnly. From motives of prudence, as well as personal
      disgust, she continued firm in declining to receive her brother. She would
      not relent when the Countess pointed out a dim, a dazzling prospect,
      growing out of Evan's proximity to the heiress of Beckley Court; she was
      not to be moved when Caroline suggested that the specific for the frail
      invalid was Evan's presence. As to this, Juliana was sufficiently open,
      though, as she conceived, her art was extreme.
    
    
      'Do you know why I stay to vex and trouble you?' she asked Caroline.
      'Well, then, it is that I may see your brother united to you all: and then
      I shall go, happy.'
    
    
      The pretext served also to make him the subject of many conversations.
      Twice a week a bunch of the best flowers that could be got were sorted and
      arranged by her, and sent namelessly to brighten Evan's chamber.
    
    
      'I may do such a thing as this, you know, without incurring blame,' she
      said.
    
    
      The sight of a love so humble in its strength and affluence, sent Caroline
      to Evan on a fruitless errand. What availed it, that accused of giving
      lead to his pride in refusing the heiress, Evan should declare that he did
      not love her? He did not, Caroline admitted as possible, but he might. He
      might learn to love her, and therefore he was wrong in wounding her heart.
      She related flattering anecdotes. She drew tearful pictures of Juliana's
      love for him: and noticing how he seemed to prize his bouquet of flowers,
      said:
    
    
      'Do you love them for themselves, or the hand that sent them?'
    
    
      Evan blushed, for it had been a struggle for him to receive them, as he
      thought, from Rose in secret. The flowers lost their value; the song that
      had arisen out of them, 'Thou livest in my memory,' ceased. But they came
      still. How many degrees from love gratitude may be, I have not reckoned. I
      rather fear it lies on the opposite shore. From a youth to a girl, it may
      yet be very tender; the more so, because their ages commonly exclude such
      a sentiment, and nature seems willing to make a transition stage of it.
      Evan wrote to Juliana. Incidentally he expressed a wish to see her.
      Juliana was under doctor's interdict: but she was not to be prevented from
      going when Evan wished her to go. They met in the park, as before, and he
      talked to her five minutes through the carriage window.
    
    
      'Was it worth the risk, my poor child?' said Caroline, pityingly.
    
    
      Juliana cried: 'Oh! I would give anything to live!'
    
    
      A man might have thought that she made no direct answer.
    
    
      'Don't you think I am patient? Don't you think I am very patient?'she
      asked Caroline, winningly, on their way home.
    
    
      Caroline could scarcely forbear from smiling at the feverish anxiety she
      showed for a reply that should confirm her words and hopes.
    
    
      'So we must all be!'she said, tend that common-place remark caused Juliana
      to exclaim: 'Prisoners have lived in a dungeon, on bread and water, for
      years!'
    
    
      Whereat Caroline kissed her so tenderly that Juliana tried to look
      surprised, and failing, her thin lips quivered; she breathed a soft
      'hush,' and fell on Caroline's bosom.
    
    
      She was transparent enough in one thing; but the flame which burned within
      her did not light her through.
    
    
      Others, on other matters, were quite as transparent to her.
    
    
      Caroline never knew that she had as much as told her the moral suicide
      Evan had committed at Beckley; so cunningly had she been probed at
      intervals with little casual questions; random interjections, that one who
      loved him could not fail to meet; petty doubts requiring elucidations. And
      the Countess, kind as her sentiments had grown toward the afflicted
      creature, was compelled to proclaim her densely stupid in material
      affairs. For the Countess had an itch of the simplest feminine curiosity
      to know whether the dear child had any notion of accomplishing a certain
      holy duty of the perishable on this earth, who might possess worldly
      goods; and no hints       not even plain speaking, would do. Juliana did
      not understand her at all.
    
    
      The Countess exhibited a mourning-ring on her finger, Mrs. Bonner's
      bequest to her.
    
    
      'How fervent is my gratitude to my excellent departed friend for this! A
      legacy, however trifling, embalms our dear lost ones in the memory!'
    
    
      It was of no avail. Juliana continued densely stupid. Was she not worse?
      The Countess could not, 'in decency,' as she observed, reveal to her who
      had prompted Mrs. Bonner so to bequeath the Beckley estates as to 'ensure
      sweet Juliana's future'; but ought not Juliana to divine it?       Juliana
      at least had hints sufficient.
    
    
      Cold Spring winds were now blowing. Juliana had resided no less than two
      months with the Cogglesbys. She was entreated still to remain, and she
      did. From Lady Jocelyn she heard not a word of remonstrance; but from Miss
      Carrington and Mrs. Shorne she received admonishing letters. Finally, Mr.
      Harry Jocelyn presented himself. In London, and without any of that
      needful subsistence which a young gentleman feels the want of in London
      more than elsewhere, Harry began to have thoughts of his own, without any
      instigation from his aunts, about devoting himself to business. So he sent
      his card up to his cousin, and was graciously met in the drawing-room by
      the Countess, who ruffled him and smoothed him, and would possibly have
      distracted his soul from business had his circumstances been less
      straitened. Juliana was declared to be too unwell to see him that day. He
      called a second time, and enjoyed a similar greeting. His third visit
      procured him an audience alone with Juliana, when, at once, despite the
      warnings of his aunts, the frank fellow plunged, 'medias res'. Mrs. Bonner
      had left him totally dependent on his parents and his chances.
    
    
      'A desperate state of things, isn't it, Juley? I think I shall go for a
      soldier       common, you know.'
    
    
      Instead of shrieking out against such a debasement of his worth and
      gentility, as was to be expected, Juliana said:
    
    
      'That's what Mr. Harrington thought of doing.'
    
    
      'He! If he'd had the pluck he would.'
    
    
      'His duty forbade it, and he did not.'
    
    
      'Duty! a confounded tailor! What fools we were to have him at Beckley!'
    
    
      'Has the Countess been unkind to you Harry?'
    
    
      'I haven't seen her to-day, and don't want to. It's my little dear old
      Juley I came for.'
    
    
      'Dear Harry!' she thanked him with eyes and hands. 'Come often, won't
      you?'
    
    
      'Why, ain't you coming back to us, Juley?'
    
    
      'Not yet. They are very kind to me here. How is Rose?'
    
    
      'Oh, quite jolly. She and Ferdinand are thick again. Balls every night.
      She dances like the deuce. They want me to go; but I ain't the sort of
      figure for those places, and besides, I shan't dance till I can lead you
      out.'
    
    
      A spur of laughter at Harry's generous nod brought on Juliana's cough.
      Harry watched her little body shaken and her reddened eyes. Some real
      emotion       perhaps the fear which healthy young people experience at
      the sight of deadly disease       made Harry touch her arm with the
      softness of a child's touch.
    
    
      'Don't be alarmed, Harry,' she said. 'It's nothing       only Winter. I'm
      determined to get well.'
    
    
      'That's right,' quoth he, recovering. 'I know you've got pluck, or you
      wouldn't have stood that operation.'
    
    
      'Let me see: when was that?' she asked slyly.
    
    
      Harry coloured, for it related to a time when he had not behaved prettily
      to her.
    
    
      'There, Juley, that 's all forgotten. I was a fool-a scoundrel, if you
      like. I 'm sorry for it now.'
    
    
      'Do you want money, Harry?'
    
    
      'Oh, money!'
    
    
      'Have you repaid Mr. Harrington yet?'
    
    
      'There       no, I haven't. Bother it! that fellow's name's always on your
      tongue. I'll tell you what, Juley       but it's no use. He's a low,
      vulgar adventurer.'
    
    
      'Dear Harry,' said Juliana, softly; 'don't bring your aunts with you when
      you come to see me.'
    
    
      'Well, then I'll tell you, Juley. It's enough that he's a beastly tailor.'
    
    
      'Quite enough,' she responded; 'and he is neither a fool nor a scoundrel.'
    
    
      Harry's memory for his own speech was not quick. When Juliana's calm
      glance at him called it up, he jumped from his chair, crying: 'Upon my
      honour, I'll tell you what, Juley! If I had money to pay him to-morrow,
      I'd insult him on the spot.'
    
    
      Juliana meditated, and said: 'Then all your friends must wish you to
      continue poor.'
    
    
      This girl had once been on her knees to him. She had looked up to him with
      admiring love, and he had given her a crumb or so occasionally, thinking
      her something of a fool, and more of a pest; but now he could not say a
      word to her without being baffled in an elderly-sisterly tone exasperating
      him so far that he positively wished to marry her, and coming to the
      point, offered himself with downright sincerity, and was rejected. Harry
      left in a passion. Juliana confided the secret to Caroline, who suggested
      interested motives, which Juliana would not hear of.
    
    
      'Ah,' said the Countess, when Caroline mentioned the case to her, 'of
      course the poor thing cherishes her first offer. She would believe a
      curate to be disinterested! But mind that Evan has due warning when she is
      to meet him. Mind that he is dressed becomingly.'
    
    
      Caroline asked why.
    
    
      'Because, my dear, she is enamoured of his person. These little unhealthy
      creatures are always attracted by the person. She thinks it to be Evan's
      qualities. I know better: it is his person. Beckley Court may be lost by a
      shabby coat!'
    
    
      The Countess had recovered from certain spiritual languors into which she
      had fallen after her retreat. Ultimate victory hung still in the balance.
      Oh! if Evan would only marry this little sufferer, who was so sure to die
      within a year! or, if she lived (for marriage has often been as a
      resurrection to some poor female invalids), there was Beckley Court, a
      splendid basis for future achievements. Reflecting in this fashion, the
      Countess pardoned her brother. Glowing hopes hung fresh lamps in her
      charitable breast. She stepped across the threshold of Tailordom, won Mr.
      Goren's heart by her condescension, and worked Evan into a sorrowful mood
      concerning the invalid. Was not Juliana his only active friend? In return,
      he said things which only required a little colouring to be very
      acceptable to her.
    
    
      The game waxed exciting again. The enemy (the Jocelyn party) was alert,
      but powerless. The three sisters were almost wrought to perform a
      sacrifice far exceeding Evan's. They nearly decided to summon him to the
      house: but the matter being broached at table one evening, Major Strike
      objected to it so angrily that they abandoned it, with the satisfactory
      conclusion that if they did wrong it was the Major's fault.
    
    
      Meantime Juliana had much on her conscience. She knew Evan to be innocent,
      and she allowed Rose to think him guilty. Could she bring her heart to
      join them? That was not in her power: but desiring to be lulled by a
      compromise, she devoted herself to make his relatives receive him; and on
      days of bitter winds she would drive out to meet him, answering all
      expostulations with       'I should not go if he were here.'
    
    
      The game waxed hot. It became a question whether Evan should be admitted
      to the house in spite of the Major. Juliana now made an extraordinary
      move. Having the Count with her in the carriage one day, she stopped in
      front of Mr. Goren's shop, and Evan had to come out. The Count returned
      home extremely mystified. Once more the unhappy Countess was obliged to
      draw bills on the fabulous; and as she had recommenced the system, which
      was not without its fascinations to her, Juliana, who had touched the
      spring, had the full benefit of it. The Countess had deceived her before       what
      of that? She spoke things sweet to hear. Who could be false that gave her
      heart food on which it lived?
    
    
      One night Juliana returned from her drive alarmingly ill. She was watched
      through the night by Caroline and the Countess alternately. In the morning
      the sisters met.
    
    
      'She has consented to let us send for a doctor,' said Caroline.
    
    
      'Her chief desire seems to be a lawyer,' said the Countess.
    
    
      'Yes, but the doctor must be sent for first.'
    
    
      'Yes, indeed! But it behoves us to previse that the doctor does not kill
      her before the lawyer comes.'
    
    
      Caroline looked at Louisa, and said: 'Are you ignorant?'
    
    
      'No       what?' cried the Countess eagerly.
    
    
      'Evan has written to tell Lady Jocelyn the state of her health, and       '
    
    
      'And that naturally has aggravated her malady!' The Countess cramped her
      long fingers. 'The child heard it from him yesterday! Oh, I could swear at
      that brother!'
    
    
      She dropped into a chair and sat rigid and square-jawed, a sculpture of
      unutterable rage.
    
    
      In the afternoon Lady Jocelyn arrived. The doctor was there       the
      lawyer had gone. Without a word of protest Juliana accompanied her
      ladyship to Beckley Court. Here was a blow!
    
    
      But Andrew was preparing one more mighty still. What if the Cogglesby
      Brewery proved a basis most unsound? Where must they fall then? Alas! on
      that point whence they sprang. If not to Perdition       Tailordom!
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XLI. REVEALS AN ABOMINABLE PLOT OF THE BROTHERS COGGLESBY
    
    
      A lively April day, with strong gusts from the Southwest, and long
      sweeping clouds, saluted the morning coach from London to Lymport. Thither
      Tailordom triumphant was bearing its victim at a rattling pace, to settle
      him, and seal him for ever out of the ranks of gentlemen: Society,
      meantime, howling exclusion to him in the background: 'Out of our halls,
      degraded youth: The smiles of turbaned matrons: the sighs of delicate
      maids; genial wit, educated talk, refined scandal, vice in harness,
      dinners sentineled by stately plush: these, the flavour of life, are not
      for you, though you stole a taste of them, wretched impostor! Pay for it
      with years of remorse!'
    
    
      The coach went rushing against the glorious high wind. It stirred his
      blood, freshened his cheeks, gave a bright tone of zest to his eyes, as he
      cast them on the young green country. Not banished from the breath of
      heaven, or from self-respect, or from the appetite for the rewards that
      are to follow duties done! Not banished from the help that is always
      reached to us when we have fairly taken the right road: and that for him
      is the road to Lymport. Let the kingdom of Gilt Gingerbread howl as it
      will! We are no longer children, but men: men who have bitten hard at
      experience, and know the value of a tooth: who have had our hearts
      bruised, and cover them with armour: who live not to feed, but look to
      food that we may live! What matters it that yonder high-spiced kingdom
      should excommunicate such as we are? We have rubbed off the gilt, and have
      assumed the command of our stomachs. We are men from this day!
    
    
      Now, you would have thought Evan's companions, right and left of him, were
      the wretches under sentence, to judge from appearances. In contrast with
      his look of insolent pleasure, Andrew, the moment an eye was on him,
      exhibited the cleverest impersonation of the dumps ever seen: while Mr.
      Raikes was from head to foot nothing better than a moan made visible.
      Nevertheless, they both agreed to rally Evan, and bid him be of good
      cheer.
    
    
      'Don't be down, Van; don't be down, my boy,' said Andrew, rubbing his
      hands gloomily.
    
    
      'I? do I look it?' Evan answered, laughing.
    
    
      'Capital acting!' exclaimed Raikes. 'Try and keep it up.'
    
    
      'Well, I hope you're acting too,' said Evan.
    
    
      Raikes let his chest fall like a collapsing bellows.
    
    
      At the end of five minutes, he remarked: 'I've been sitting on it the
      whole morning! There's violent inflammation, I'm persuaded. Another hour,
      and I jump slap from the summit of the coach!'
    
    
      Evan turned to Andrew.
    
    
      'Do you think he'll be let off?'
    
    
      'Mr. Raikes? Can't say. You see, Van, it depends upon how Old Tom has
      taken his bad luck. Ahem! Perhaps he'll be all the stricter; and as a man
      of honour, Mr. Raikes, you see, can't very well       '
    
    
      'By Jove! I wish I wasn't a man of honour!' Raikes interposed, heavily.
    
    
      'You see, Van, Old Tom's circumstances'       Andrew ducked, to smother a
      sort of laughter       'are now such that he'd be glad of the money to let
      him off, no doubt; but Mr. Raikes has spent it, I can't lend it, and you
      haven't got it, and there we all are. At the end of the year he's free,
      and he       ha! ha! I'm not a bit the merrier for laughing, I can tell
      you.'
    
    
      Catching another glimpse of Evan's serious face, Andrew fell into louder
      laughter; checking it with doleful solemnity.
    
    
      Up hill and down hill, and past little homesteads shining with yellow
      crocuses; across wide brown heaths, whose outlines raised in Evan's mind
      the night of his funeral walk, and tossed up old feelings dead as the
      whirling dust. At last Raikes called out:
    
    
      'The towers of Fallow field; heigho!'
    
    
      And Andrew said:
    
    
      'Now then, Van: if Old Tom's anywhere, he's here. You get down at the
      Dragon, and don't you talk to me, but let me go in. It'll be just the hour
      he dines in the country. Isn't it a shame of him to make me face every man
      of the creditors       eh?'
    
    
      Evan gave Andrew's hand an affectionate squeeze, at which Andrew had to
      gulp down something       reciprocal emotion, doubtless.
    
    
      'Hark,' said Raikes, as the horn of the guard was heard. 'Once that sound
      used to set me caracoling before an abject multitude. I did wonders. All
      London looked on me! It had more effect on me than champagne. Now I hear
      it       the whole charm has vanished! I can't see a single old castle.
      Would you have thought it possible that a small circular bit of tin on a
      man's person could produce such changes in him?'
    
    
      'You are a donkey to wear it,' said Evan.
    
    
      'I pledged my word as a gentleman, and thought it small, for the money!'
      said Raikes. 'This is the first coach I ever travelled on, without making
      the old whip burst with laughing. I'm not myself. I'm haunted. I'm
      somebody else.'
    
    
      The three passengers having descended, a controversy commenced between
      Evan and Andrew as to which should pay. Evan had his money out; Andrew
      dashed it behind him; Evan remonstrated.
    
    
      'Well, you mustn't pay for us two, Andrew. I would have let you do it
      once, but       '
    
    
      'Stuff!' cried Andrew. 'I ain't paying       it 's the creditors of the
      estate, my boy!'
    
    
      Evan looked so ingenuously surprised and hurt at his lack of principle,
      that Andrew chucked a sixpence at a small boy, saying,
    
    
      'If you don't let me have my own way, Van, I 'll shy my purse after it.
      What do you mean, sir, by treating me like a beggar?'
    
    
      'Our friend Harrington can't humour us,' quoth Raikes. 'For myself, I
      candidly confess I prefer being paid for'; and he leaned contentedly
      against one of the posts of the inn till the filthy dispute was arranged
      to the satisfaction of the ignobler mind. There Andrew left them, and went
      to Mrs. Sockley, who, recovered from her illness, smiled her usual placid
      welcome to a guest.
    
    
      'You know me, ma'am?'
    
    
      'Oh, yes! The London Mr. Cogglesby!'
    
    
      'Now, ma'am, look here. I've come for my brother. Don't be alarmed. No
      danger as yet. But, mind! if you attempt to conceal him from his lawful
      brother, I'll summon here the myrmidons of the law.'
    
    
      Mrs. Sockley showed a serious face.
    
    
      'You know his habits, Mr. Cogglesby; and one doesn't go against any one of
      his whimsies, or there's consequences: but the house is open to you, sir.
      I don't wish to hide him.'
    
    
      Andrew accepted this intelligent evasion of Tom Cogglesby's orders as
      sufficient, and immediately proceeded upstairs. A door shut on the first
      landing. Andrew went to this door and knocked. No answer. He tried to open
      it, but found that he had been forestalled. After threatening to talk
      business through the key-hole, the door was unlocked, and Old Tom
      appeared.
    
    
      'So! now you're dogging me into the country. Be off; make an appointment.
      Saturday's my holiday. You know that.'
    
    
      Andrew pushed through the doorway, and, by way of an emphatic reply and a
      silencing one, delivered a punch slap into Old Tom's belt.
    
    
      'Confound you, Nan!' said Old Tom, grimacing, but friendly, as if his
      sympathies had been irresistibly assailed.
    
    
      'It 's done, Tom! I've done it. Won my bet, now,' Andrew exclaimed. 'The
      women-poor creatures! What a state they're in. I pity 'em.'
    
    
      Old Tom pursed his lips, and eyed his brother incredulously, but with
      curious eagerness.
    
    
      'Oh, Lord! what a face I've had to wear!' Andrew continued, and while he
      sank into a chair and rubbed his handkerchief over his crisp hair, Old Tom
      let loose a convinced and exulting, 'ha! ha!'
    
    
      'Yes, you may laugh. I've had all the bother,' said Andrew.
    
    
      'Serve ye right       marrying such cattle,' Old Tom snapped at him.
    
    
      'They believe we're bankrupt       owe fifty thousand clear, Tom!'
    
    
      'Ha! ha!'
    
    
      'Brewery stock and household furniture to be sold by general auction,
      Friday week.'
    
    
      'Ha! ha!'
    
    
      'Not a place for any of us to poke our heads into. I talked about
      "pitiless storms" to my poor Harry       no shelter to be had unless we go
      down to Lymport, and stop with their brother in shop!'
    
    
      Old Tom did enjoy this. He took a great gulp of air for a tremendous burst
      of laughter, and when this was expended and reflection came, his features
      screwed, as if the acidest of flavours had ravished his palate.
    
    
      'Bravo, Nan! Didn't think you were man enough. Ha! ha! Nan       I say       eh?
      how did ye get on behind the curtains?'
    
    
      The tale, to guess by Andrew's face, appeared to be too strongly infused
      with pathos for revelation.
    
    
      'Will they go, Nan, eh? d' ye think they 'll go?'
    
    
      'Where else can they go, Tom? They must go there, or on the parish, you
      know.'
    
    
      'They'll all troop down to the young tailor       eh?'
    
    
      'They can't sleep in the parks, Tom.'
    
    
      'No. They can't get into Buckingham Palace, neither       'cept as
      housemaids. 'Gad, they're howling like cats, I'd swear       nuisance to
      the neighbourhood       ha! ha!'
    
    
      Old Tom's cruel laughter made Andrew feel for the unhappy ladies. He stuck
      his forehead, and leaned forward, saying: 'I don't know       'pon my
      honour, I don't know       can't think we've       quite done right to
      punish 'em so.'
    
    
      This acted like cold water on Old Tom's delight. He pitched it back in the
      shape of a doubt of what Andrew had told him. Whereupon Andrew defied him
      to face three miserable women on the verge of hysterics; and Old Tom,
      beginning to chuckle again, rejoined that it would bring them to their
      senses, and emancipate him.
    
    
      'You may laugh, Mr. Tom,' said Andrew; 'but if poor Harry should find me
      out, deuce a bit more home for me.'
    
    
      Old Tom looked at him keenly, and rapped the table. 'Swear you did it,
      Nan.'
    
    
      'You promise you'll keep the secret,' said Andrew.
    
    
      'Never make promises.'
    
    
      'Then there's a pretty life for me! I did it for that poor dear boy. You
      were only up to one of your jokes       I see that. Confound you, Old Tom,
      you've been making a fool of me.'
    
    
      The flattering charge was not rejected by Old Tom, who now had his brother
      to laugh at as well. Andrew affected to be indignant and desperate.
    
    
      'If you'd had a heart, Tom, you'd have saved the poor fellow without any
      bother at all. What do you think? When I told him of our smash       ha!
      ha! it isn't such a bad joke-well, I went to him, hanging my head, and he
      offered to arrange our affairs       that is       '
    
    
      'Damned meddlesome young dog!' cried Old Tom, quite in a rage.
    
    
      'There       you're up in a twinkling,' said Andrew. 'Don't you see he
      believed it, you stupid Old Tom? Lord! to hear him say how sorry he was,
      and to see how glad he looked at the chance of serving us!'
    
    
      'Serving us!' Tom sneered.
    
    
      'Ha!' went Andrew. 'Yes. There. You're a deuced deal prouder than fifty
      peers. You're an upside-down old despot!'
    
    
      No sharper retort rising to Old Tom's lips, he permitted his brother's
      abuse of him to pass, declaring that bandying words was not his business,
      he not being a Parliament man.
    
    
      'How about the Major, Nan? He coming down, too?'
    
    
      'Major!' cried Andrew. 'Lucky if he keeps his commission. Coming down? No.
      He's off to the Continent.'
    
    
      'Find plenty of scamps there to keep him company,' added Tom. 'So he's
      broke       eh? ha! ha!'
    
    
      'Tom,' said Andrew, seriously, 'I'll tell you all about it, if you 'll
      swear not to split on me, because it would really upset poor Harry so. She
      'd think me such a beastly hypocrite, I couldn't face her afterwards.'
    
    
      'Lose what pluck you have       eh?' Tom jerked out his hand, and bade his
      brother continue.
    
    
      Compelled to trust in him without a promise, Andrew said: 'Well, then,
      after we'd arranged it, I went back to Harry, and begged her to have poor
      Van at the house told her what I hoped you'd do for him about getting him
      into the Brewery. She's very kind, Tom, 'pon my honour she is. She was
      willing, only       '
    
    
      'Only       eh?'
    
    
      'Well, she was so afraid it'd hurt her sisters to see him there.'
    
    
      Old Tom saw he was in for excellent fun, and wouldn't spoil it for the
      world.
    
    
      'Yes, Nan?'
    
    
      'So I went to Caroline. She was easy enough; and she went to the
      Countess.'
    
    
      'Well, and she       ?'
    
    
      'She was willing, too, till Lady Jocelyn came and took Miss Bonner home to
      Beckley, and because Evan had written to my lady to fetch her, the
      Countess       she was angry. That was all. Because of that, you know. But
      yet she agreed. But when Miss Bonner had gone, it turned out that the
      Major was the obstacle. They were all willing enough to have Evan there,
      but the Major refused. I didn't hear him. I wasn't going to ask him. I
      mayn't be a match for three women, but man to man, eh, Tom? You'd back me
      there? So Harry said the Major 'd make Caroline miserable, if his wishes
      were disrespected. By George, I wish I'd know, then. Don't you think it
      odd, Tom, now? There's a Duke of Belfield the fellow had hooked into his
      Company; and       through Evan I heard       the Duke had his name struck
      off. After that, the Major swore at the Duke once or twice, and said
      Caroline wasn't to go out with him. Suddenly, he insists that she shall
      go. Days the poor thing kept crying! One day, he makes her go. She hasn't
      the spirit of my Harry or the Countess. By good luck, Van, who was hunting
      ferns for some friends of his, met them on Sunday in Richmond Park, and
      Van took her away from the Duke. But, Tom, think of Van seeing a fellow
      watching her wherever she went, and hearing the Duke's coachman tell that
      fellow he had orders to drive his master and a lady hard on to the sea
      that night. I don't believe it       it wasn't Caroline! But what do you
      think of our finding out that beast of a spy to be in the Major's pay? We
      did. Van put a constable on his track; we found him out, and he confessed
      it. A fact, Tom! That decided me. If it was only to get rid of a brute, I
      determined I 'd do it, and I did. Strike came to me to get my name for a
      bill that night. 'Gad, he looked blanker than his bill when he heard of us
      two bankrupt. I showed him one or two documents I'd got ready. Says he:
      "Never mind; it'll only be a couple of hundred more in the schedule."
      Stop, Tom! he's got some of our blood. I don't think he meant it. He is
      hard pushed. Well, I gave him a twentier, and he was off the next night.
      You 'll soon see all about the Company in the papers.'
    
    
      At the conclusion of Andrew's recital, Old Tom thrummed and looked on the
      floor under a heavy frown. His mouth worked dubiously, and, from moment to
      moment, he plucked at his waistcoat and pulled it down, throwing back his
      head and glaring.
    
    
      'I 've knocked that fellow over once,' he said. 'Wish he hadn't got up
      again.'
    
    
      Andrew nodded.
    
    
      'One good thing, Nan. He never boasted of our connection. Much obliged to
      him.'
    
    
      'Yes,' said Andrew, who was gladly watching Old Tom's change of mood with
      a quiescent aspect.
    
    
      'Um!       must keep it quiet from his poor old mother.'
    
    
      Andrew again affirmatived his senior's remarks. That his treatment of Old
      Tom was sound, he presently had proof of. The latter stood up, and after
      sniffing in an injured way for about a minute, launched out his right leg,
      and vociferated that he would like to have it in his power to kick all the
      villains out of the world: a modest demand Andrew at once chimed in with;
      adding that, were such a faculty extended to him, he would not object to
      lose the leg that could benefit mankind so infinitely, and consented to
      its following them. Then, Old Tom, who was of a practical turn, meditated,
      swung his foot, and gave one grim kick at the imaginary bundle of
      villains, discharged them headlong straight into space. Andrew, naturally
      imitative, and seeing that he had now to kick them flying, attempted to
      excel Old Tom in the vigour of his delivery. No wonder that the efforts of
      both were heating: they were engaged in the task of ridding the globe of
      the larger half of its inhabitants. Tom perceived Andrew's useless
      emulation, and with a sound translated by 'yack,' sent his leg out a long
      way. Not to be outdone, Andrew immediately, with a still louder 'yack,'
      committed himself to an effort so violent that the alternative between his
      leg coming off, or his being taken off his leg, was propounded by nature,
      and decided by the laws of gravity in a trice. Joyful grunts were emitted
      by Old Tom at the sight of Andrew prostrate, rubbing his pate. But Mrs.
      Sockley, to whom the noise of Andrew's fall had suggested awful fears of a
      fratricidal conflict upstairs, hurried forthwith to announce to them that
      the sovereign remedy for human ills, the promoter of concord, the healer
      of feuds, the central point of man's destiny in the flesh       Dinner,
      was awaiting them.
    
    
      To the dinner they marched.
    
    
      Of this great festival be it simply told that the supply was copious and
      of good quality       much too good and copious for a bankrupt host: that
      Evan and Mr. John Raikes were formally introduced to Old Tom before the
      repast commenced, and welcomed some three minutes after he had decided the
      flavour of his first glass; that Mr. Raikes in due time preferred his
      petition for release from a dreadful engagement, and furnished vast
      amusement to the company under Old Tom's hand, until, by chance, he quoted
      a scrap of Latin, at which the brothers Cogglesby, who would have faced
      peers and princes without being disconcerted, or performing mental
      genuflexions, shut their mouths and looked injured, unhappy, and in the
      presence of a superior: Mr. Raikes not being the man to spare them.
      Moreover, a surprise was afforded to Evan. Andrew stated to Old Tom that
      the hospitality of Main Street, Lymport,       was open to him. Strange to
      say, Old Tom accepted it on the spot, observing, 'You're master of the
      house       can do what you like, if you 're man enough,' and adding that
      he thanked him, and would come in a day or two. The case of Mr. Raikes was
      still left uncertain, for as the bottle circulated, he exhibited such a
      faculty for apt, but to the brothers, totally incomprehensible quotation,
      that they fled from him without leaving him time to remember what special
      calamity was on his mind, or whether this earth was other than an abode
      conceived in great jollity for his life-long entertainment.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XLII. JULIANA
    
    
      The sick night-light burned steadily in Juliana's chamber. On a couch,
      beside her bed, Caroline lay sleeping, tired with a long watch. Two
      sentences had been passed on Juliana: one on her heart: one on her body:
      'Thou art not loved'; and, 'Thou must die.' The frail passion of her
      struggle against her destiny was over with her. Quiet as that quiet which
      Nature was taking her to, her body reposed. Calm as the solitary
      night-light before her open eyes, her spirit was wasting away. 'If I am
      not loved, then let me die!' In such a sense she bowed to her fate.
    
    
      At an hour like this, watching the round of light on the ceiling, with its
      narrowing inner rings, a sufferer from whom pain has fled looks back to
      the shores she is leaving, and would be well with them who walk there. It
      is false to imagine that schemers and workers in the dark are destitute of
      the saving gift of conscience. They have it, and it is perhaps made
      livelier in them than with easy people; and therefore, they are
      imperatively spurred to hoodwink it. Hence, their self-delusion is deep
      and endures. They march to their object, and gaining or losing it, the
      voice that calls to them is the voice of a blind creature, whom any
      answer, provided that the answer is ready, will silence. And at an hour
      like this, when finally they snatch their minute of sight on the threshold
      of black night, their souls may compare with yonder shining circle on the
      ceiling, which, as the light below gasps for air, contracts, and extends
      but to mingle with the darkness. They would be nobler, better, boundlessly
      good to all;       to those who have injured them to those whom they have
      injured. Alas! for any definite deed the limit of their circle is
      immoveable, and they must act within it. The trick they have played
      themselves imprisons them. Beyond it, they cease to be.
    
    
      Lying in this utter stillness, Juliana thought of Rose; of her beloved by
      Evan. The fever that had left her blood, had left it stagnant, and her
      thoughts were quite emotionless. She looked faintly on a far picture. She
      saw Rose blooming with pleasures in Elburne House, sliding as a boat borne
      by the river's tide to sea, away from her living joy. The breast of Rose
      was lucid to her, and in that hour of insight she had clear knowledge of
      her cousin's heart; how it scoffed at its base love, and unwittingly
      betrayed the power on her still, by clinging to the world and what it
      would give her to fill the void; how externally the lake was untroubled,
      and a mirror to the passing day; and how within there pressed a flood
      against an iron dam. Evan, too, she saw. The Countess was right in her
      judgement of Juliana's love. Juliana looked very little to his qualities.
      She loved him when she thought him guilty, which made her conceive that
      her love was of a diviner cast than Rose was capable of. Guilt did not
      spoil his beauty to her; his gentleness and glowing manhood were
      unchanged; and when she knew him as he was, the revelation of his high
      nature simply confirmed her impression of his physical perfections. She
      had done him a wrong; at her death news would come to him, and it might be
      that he would bless her name. Because she sighed no longer for those dear
      lips and strong arms to close about her tremulous frame, it seemed to her
      that she had quite surrendered him. Generous to Evan, she would be just to
      Rose. Beneath her pillow she found pencil and paper, and with difficulty,
      scarce seeing her letters in the brown light, she began to trace lines of
      farewell to Rose. Her conscience dictated to her thus, 'Tell Rose that she
      was too ready to accept his guilt; and that in this as in all things, she
      acted with the precipitation of her character. Tell her that you always
      trusted, and that now you know him innocent. Give her the proofs you have.
      Show that he did it to shield his intriguing sister. Tell her that you
      write this only to make her just to him. End with a prayer that Rose may
      be happy.'
    
    
      Ere Juliana had finished one sentence, she resigned the pencil. Was it not
      much, even at the gates of death, to be the instrument to send Rose into
      his arms? The picture swayed before her, helping her weakness. She found
      herself dreaming that he had kissed her once. Dorothy, she remembered, had
      danced up to her one day, to relate what the maids of the house said of
      the gentleman       (at whom, it is known, they look with the licence of
      cats toward kings); and Dorothy's fresh careless mouth had told how one
      observant maid, amorously minded, proclaimed of Evan, to a companion of
      her sex, that, 'he was the only gentleman who gave you an idea of how he
      would look when he was kissing you.' Juliana cherished that vision
      likewise. Young ladies are not supposed to do so, if menial maids are; but
      Juliana did cherish it, and it possessed her fancy. Bear in your
      recollection that she was not a healthy person. Diseased little heroines
      may be made attractive, and are now popular; but strip off the cleverly
      woven robe which is fashioned to cover them, and you will find them in
      certain matters bearing a resemblance to menial maids.
    
    
      While the thoughts of his kiss lasted, she could do nothing; but lay with
      her two hands out on the bed, and her eyelids closed. Then waking, she
      took the pencil again. It would not move: her bloodless fingers fell from
      it.
    
    
      'If they do not meet, and he never marries, I may claim him in the next
      world,' she mused.
    
    
      But conscience continued uneasy. She turned her wrist and trailed a letter
      from beneath the pillow. It was from Mrs. Shorne. Juliana knew the
      contents. She raised it unopened as high as her faltering hands permitted,
      and read like one whose shut eyes read syllables of fire on the darkness.
    
    
      'Rose has at last definitely engaged herself to Ferdinand, you will be
      glad to hear, and we may now treat her as a woman.'
    
    
      Having absorbed these words, Juliana's hand found strength to write, with
      little difficulty, what she had to say to Rose. She conceived it to be
      neither sublime nor generous: not even good; merely her peculiar duty.
      When it was done, she gave a long, low sigh of relief.
    
    
      Caroline whispered, 'Dearest child, are you awake?'
    
    
      'Yes,' she answered.
    
    
      'Sorrowful, dear?'
    
    
      'Very quiet.'
    
    
      Caroline reached her hand over to her, and felt the paper. 'What is this?'
    
    
      'My good-bye to Rose. I want it folded now.'
    
    
      Caroline slipped from the couch to fulfil her wish. She enclosed the
      pencilled scrap of paper, sealed it, and asked, 'Is that right?'
    
    
      'Now unlock my desk,' Juliana uttered, feebly. 'Put it beside a letter
      addressed to a law-gentleman. Post both the morning I am gone.'
    
    
      Caroline promised to obey, and coming to Juliana to mark her looks,
      observed a faint pleased smile dying away, and had her hand gently
      squeezed. Juliana's conscience had preceded her contentedly to its last
      sleep; and she, beneath that round of light on the ceiling, drew on her
      counted breaths in peace till dawn.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XLIII. ROSE
    
    
      Have you seen a young audacious spirit smitten to the earth? It is a
      singular study; and, in the case of young women, a trap for inexperienced
      men. Rose, who had commanded and managed every one surrounding her since
      infancy, how humble had she now become!       how much more womanly in
      appearance, and more child-like at heart! She was as wax in Lady Elburne's
      hands. A hint of that veiled episode, the Beckley campaign, made Rose
      pliant, as if she had woven for herself a rod of scorpions. The high
      ground she had taken; the perfect trust in one; the scorn of any
      judgement, save her own; these had vanished from her. Rose, the tameless
      heroine who had once put her mother's philosophy in action, was the
      easiest filly that turbaned matron ever yet drove into the straight road
      of the world. It even surprised Lady Jocelyn to see how wonderfully she
      had been broken in by her grandmother. Her ladyship wrote to Drummond to
      tell him of it, and Drummond congratulated her, saying, however: 'Changes
      of this sort don't come of conviction. Wait till you see her at home. I
      think they have been sticking pins into the sore part.'
    
    
      Drummond knew Rose well. In reality there was no change in her. She was
      only a suppliant to be spared from ridicule: spared from the application
      of the scourge she had woven for herself.
    
    
      And, ah! to one who deigned to think warmly still of such a disgraced
      silly creature, with what gratitude she turned! He might well suppose love
      alone could pour that profusion of jewels at his feet.
    
    
      Ferdinand, now Lord Laxley, understood the merits of his finger-nails
      better than the nature of young women; but he is not to be blamed for
      presuming that Rose had learnt to adore him. Else why did she like his
      company so much? He was not mistaken in thinking she looked up to him. She
      seemed to beg to be taken into his noble serenity. In truth she sighed to
      feel as he did, above everybody!       she that had fallen so low! Above
      everybody!       born above them, and therefore superior by grace divine!
      To this Rose Jocelyn had come       she envied the mind of Ferdinand.
    
    
      He, you may be sure, was quite prepared to accept her homage. Rose he had
      always known to be just the girl for him; spirited, fresh, and with fine
      teeth; and once tied to you safe to be staunch. They walked together, rode
      together, danced together. Her soft humility touched him to eloquence. Say
      she was a little hypocrite, if you like, when the blood came to her cheeks
      under his eyes. Say she was a heartless minx for allowing it to be bruited
      that she and Ferdinand were betrothed. I can but tell you that her blushes
      were blushes of gratitude to one who could devote his time to such a
      disgraced silly creature, and that she, in her abject state, felt a secret
      pleasure in the protection Ferdinand's name appeared to extend over her,
      and was hardly willing to lose it.
    
    
      So far Lady Elburne's tact and discipline had been highly successful. One
      morning, in May, Ferdinand, strolling with Rose down the garden made a
      positive appeal to her common sense and friendly feeling; by which she
      understood that he wanted her consent to his marriage with her.
    
    
      Rose answered:
    
    
      'Who would have me?'
    
    
      Ferdinand spoke pretty well, and ultimately got possession of her hand.
      She let him keep it, thinking him noble for forgetting that another had
      pressed it before him.
    
    
      Some minutes later the letters were delivered. One of them contained
      Juliana's dark-winged missive.
    
    
      'Poor, poor Juley!' said Rose, dropping her head, after reading all that
      was on the crumpled leaf with an inflexible face. And then, talking on,
      long low sighs lifted her bosom at intervals. She gazed from time to time
      with a wistful conciliatory air on Ferdinand. Rushing to her chamber, the
      first cry her soul framed was:
    
    
      'He did not kiss me!'
    
    
      The young have a superstitious sense of something incontestably true in
      the final protestations of the dead. Evan guiltless! she could not quite
      take the meaning this revelation involved. That which had been dead was
      beginning to move within her; but blindly: and now it stirred and
      troubled; now sank. Guiltless all she had thought him! Oh! she knew she
      could not have been deceived. But why, why had he hidden his sacrifice
      from her?
    
    
      'It is better for us both, of course,' said Rose, speaking the world's
      wisdom, parrot-like, and bursting into tears the next minute. Guiltless,
      and gloriously guiltless! but nothing       nothing to her!
    
    
      She tried to blame him. It would not do. She tried to think of that
      grovelling loathsome position painted to her by Lady Elburne's graphic
      hand. Evan dispersed the gloomy shades like sunshine. Then in a sort of
      terror she rejoiced to think she was partially engaged to Ferdinand, and
      found herself crying again with exultation, that he had not kissed her:
      for a kiss on her mouth was to Rose a pledge and a bond.
    
    
      The struggle searched her through: bared her weakness, probed her
      strength; and she, seeing herself, suffered grievously in her self-love.
      Am I such a coward, inconstant, cold? she asked. Confirmatory answers
      coming, flung her back under the shield of Ferdinand if for a moment her
      soul stood up armed and defiant, it was Evan's hand she took.
    
    
      To whom do I belong? was another terrible question. In her ideas, if Evan
      was not chargeable with that baseness which had sundered them he might
      claim her yet, if he would. If he did, what then? Must she go to him?
    
    
      Impossible: she was in chains. Besides, what a din of laughter there would
      be to see her led away by him. Twisting her joined hands: weeping for her
      cousin, as she thought, Rose passed hours of torment over Juliana's legacy
      to her.
    
    
      'Why did I doubt him?' she cried, jealous that any soul should have known
      and trusted him better. Jealous and I am afraid that the kindling of that
      one feature of love relighted the fire of her passion thus fervidly. To be
      outstripped in generosity was hateful to her. Rose, naturally, could not
      reflect that a young creature like herself, fighting against the world, as
      we call it, has all her faculties at the utmost stretch, and is often
      betrayed by failing nature when the will is still valiant.
    
    
      And here she sat-in chains! 'Yes! I am fit only to be the wife of an idle
      brainless man, with money and a title,' she said, in extreme
      self-contempt. She caught a glimpse of her whole life in the horrid tomb
      of his embrace, and questions whether she could yield her hand to him       whether
      it was right in the eyes of heaven, rushed impetuously to console her, and
      defied anything in the shape of satisfactory affirmations. Nevertheless,
      the end of the struggle was, that she felt that she was bound to
      Ferdinand.
    
    
      'But this I will do,' said Rose, standing with heat-bright eyes and
      deep-coloured cheeks before the glass. 'I will clear his character at
      Beckley. I will help him. I will be his friend. I will wipe out the
      injustice I did him.' And this bride-elect of a lord absolutely added that
      she was unworthy to be the wife of a tailor!
    
    
      'He! how unequalled he is! There is nothing he fears except shame. Oh! how
      sad it will be for him to find no woman in his class to understand him and
      be his helpmate!'
    
    
      Over, this sad subject, of which we must presume her to be accurately
      cognizant, Rose brooded heavily. By mid-day she gave her Grandmother
      notice that she was going home to Juliana's funeral.
    
    
      'Well, Rose, if you think it necessary to join the ceremony,' said Lady
      Elburne. 'Beckley is bad quarters for you, as you have learnt. There was
      never much love between you cousins.'
    
    
      'No, and I don't pretend to it,' Rose answered. 'I am sorry poor Juley's
      gone.'
    
    
      'She's better gone for many reasons       she appears to have been a
      little venomous toad,' said Lady Elburne; and Rose, thinking of a
      snakelike death-bite working through her blood, rejoined: 'Yes, she isn't
      to be pitied she 's better off than most people.'
    
    
      So it was arranged that Rose should go. Ferdinand and her aunt, Mrs.
      Shorne, accompanied her. Mrs. Shorne gave them their opportunities, albeit
      they were all stowed together in a carriage, and Ferdinand seemed willing
      to profit by them; but Rose's hand was dead, and she sat by her future
      lord forming the vow on her lips that they should never be touched by him.
    
    
      Arrived at Beckley, she, to her great delight, found Caroline there,
      waiting for the funeral. In a few minutes she got her alone, and after
      kisses, looked penetratingly into her lovely eyes, shook her head, and
      said: 'Why were you false to me?'
    
    
      'False?' echoed Caroline.
    
    
      'You knew him. You knew why he did that. Why did you not save me?'
    
    
      Caroline fell upon her neck, asking pardon. She spared her the recital of
      facts further than the broad avowal. Evan's present condition she plainly
      stated: and Rose, when the bitter pangs had ceased, made oath to her soul
      she would rescue him from it.
    
    
      In addition to the task of clearing Evan's character, and rescuing him,
      Rose now conceived that her engagement to Ferdinand must stand ice-bound
      till Evan had given her back her troth. How could she obtain it from him?
      How could she take anything from one so noble and so poor! Happily there
      was no hurry; though before any bond was ratified, she decided
      conscientiously that it must be done.
    
    
      You see that like a lithe snake she turns on herself, and must be tracked
      in and out. Not being a girl to solve the problem with tears, or outright
      perfidy, she had to ease her heart to the great shock little by little       sincere
      as far as she knew: as far as one who loves may be. The day of the funeral
      came and went. The Jocelyns were of their mother's opinion: that for many
      reasons Juliana was better out of the way. Mrs. Bonner's bequest had been
      a severe blow to Sir Franks. However, all was now well. The estate
      naturally lapsed to Lady Jocelyn. No one in the house dreamed of a will,
      signed with Juliana's name, attested, under due legal forms, being in
      existence. None of the members of the family imagined that at Beckley
      Court they were then residing on somebody else's ground.
    
    
      Want of hospitable sentiments was not the cause that led to an intimation
      from Sir Franks to his wife, that Mrs. Strike must not be pressed to
      remain, and that Rose must not be permitted to have her own way in this.
      Knowing very well that Mrs. Shorne spoke through her husband's mouth, Lady
      Jocelyn still acquiesced, and Rose, who had pressed Caroline publicly to
      stay, had to be silent when the latter renewed her faint objections; so
      Caroline said she would leave on the morrow morning.
    
    
      Juliana, with her fretfulness, her hand bounties, her petty egoisms, and
      sudden far-leaping generosities, and all the contradictory impulses of her
      malady, had now departed utterly. The joys of a landed proprietor mounted
      into the head of Sir Franks. He was up early the next morning, and he and
      Harry walked over a good bit of the ground before breakfast. Sir Franks
      meditated making it entail, and favoured Harry with a lecture on the duty
      of his shaping the course of his conduct at once after the model of the
      landed gentry generally.
    
    
      'And you may think yourself lucky to come into that catalogue       the
      son of a younger son!' said Sir Franks, tapping Mr. Harry's shoulder.
      Harry also began to enjoy the look and smell of land. At the breakfast,
      which, though early, was well attended, Harry spoke of the adviseability
      of felling timber here, planting there, and so forth, after the model his
      father held up. Sir Franks nodded approval of his interest in the estate,
      but reserved his opinion on matters of detail.
    
    
      'All I beg of you is,' said Lady Jocelyn, 'that you won't let us have
      turnips within the circuit of a mile'; which was obligingly promised.
    
    
      The morning letters were delivered and opened with the customary calmness.
    
    
      'Letter from old George,' Harry sings out, and buzzes over a few lines.
      'Halloa!       Hum!' He was going to make a communication, but catching
      sight of Caroline, tossed the letter over to Ferdinand, who read it and
      tossed it back with the comment of a careless face.
    
    
      'Read it, Rosey?' says Harry, smiling bluntly.
    
    
      Rather to his surprise, Rose took the letter. Study her eyes if you wish
      to gauge the potency of one strong dose of ridicule on an ingenuous young
      heart. She read that Mr. George Uplift had met 'our friend Mr. Snip'
      riding, by moonlight, on the road to Beckley. That great orbed night of
      their deep tender love flashed luminously through her frame, storming at
      the base epithet by which her lover was mentioned, flooding grandly over
      the ignominies cast on him by the world. She met the world, as it were, in
      a death-grapple; she matched the living heroic youth she felt him to be,
      with that dead wooden image of him which it thrust before her. Her heart
      stood up singing like a craven who sees the tide of victory setting toward
      him. But this passed beneath her eyelids. When her eyes were lifted,
      Ferdinand could have discovered nothing in them to complain of, had his
      suspicions been light to raise: nor could Mrs. Shorne perceive that there
      was the opening for a shrewd bodkin-thrust. Rose had got a mask at last:
      her colour, voice, expression, were perfectly at command. She knew it to
      be a cowardice to wear any mask: but she had been burnt, horribly burnt:
      how much so you may guess from the supple dissimulation of such a bold
      clear-visaged girl. She conquered the sneers of the world in her soul: but
      her sensitive skin was yet alive to the pangs of the scorching it had been
      subjected to when weak, helpless, and betrayed by Evan, she stood with no
      philosophic parent to cry fair play for her, among the skilful torturers
      of Elburne House.
    
    
      Sir Franks had risen and walked to the window.
    
    
      'News?' said Lady Jocelyn, wheeling round in her chair.
    
    
      The one eyebrow up of the easy-going baronet signified trouble of mind. He
      finished his third perusal of a letter that appeared to be written in a
      remarkably plain legal hand, and looking as men do when their
      intelligences are just equal to the comprehension or expression of an
      oath, handed the letter to his wife, and observed that he should be found
      in the library. Nevertheless he waited first to mark its effect on Lady
      Jocelyn. At one part of the document her forehead wrinkled slightly.
    
    
      'Doesn't sound like a joke!' he said.
    
    
      She answered:
    
    
      'No.'
    
    
      Sir Franks, apparently quite satisfied by her ready response, turned on
      his heel and left the room quickly.
    
    
      An hour afterward it was rumoured and confirmed that Juliana Bonner had
      willed all the worldly property she held in her own right, comprising
      Beckley Court, to Mr. Evan Harrington, of Lymport, tailor. An abstract of
      the will was forwarded. The lawyer went on to say, that he had conformed
      to the desire of the testatrix in communicating the existence of the
      aforesaid will six days subsequent to her death, being the day after her
      funeral.
    
    
      There had been railing and jeering at the Countess de Saldar, the clever
      outwitted exposed adventuress, at Elburne House and Beckley Court. What
      did the crowing cleverer aristocrats think of her now?
    
    
      On Rose the blow fell bitterly. Was Evan also a foul schemer? Was he of a
      piece with his intriguing sister? His close kinship with the Countess had
      led her to think baseness possible to him when it was confessed by his own
      mouth once. She heard black names cast at him and the whole of the great
      Mel's brood, and incapable of quite disbelieving them merited, unable to
      challenge and rebut them, she dropped into her recent state of
      self-contempt: into her lately-instilled doubt whether it really was in
      Nature's power, unaided by family-portraits, coats-of-arms, ball-room
      practice, and at least one small phial of Essence of Society, to make a
      Gentleman.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XLIV. CONTAINS A WARNING TO ALL CONSPIRATORS
    
    
      This, if you have done me the favour to read it aright, has been a
      chronicle of desperate heroism on the part of almost all the principal
      personages represented. But not the Countess de Saldar, scaling the
      embattled fortress of Society; nor Rose, tossing its keys to her lover
      from the shining turret-tops; nor Evan, keeping bright the lamp of
      self-respect in his bosom against South wind and East; none excel friend
      Andrew Cogglesby, who, having fallen into Old Tom's plot to humiliate his
      wife and her sisters, simply for Evan's sake, and without any distinct
      notion of the terror, confusion, and universal upset he was bringing on
      his home, could yet, after a scared contemplation of the scene when he
      returned from his expedition to Fallow field, continue to wear his rueful
      mask; and persevere in treacherously outraging his lofty wife.
    
    
      He did it to vindicate the ties of blood against accidents of position.
      Was he justified? I am sufficiently wise to ask my own sex alone.
    
    
      On the other side, be it said (since in our modern days every hero must
      have his weak heel), that now he had gone this distance it was difficult
      to recede. It would be no laughing matter to tell his solemn Harriet that
      he had been playing her a little practical joke. His temptations to give
      it up were incessant and most agitating; but if to advance seemed
      terrific, there was, in stopping short, an awfulness so overwhelming that
      Andrew abandoned himself to the current, his real dismay adding to his
      acting powers.
    
    
      The worst was, that the joke was no longer his: it was Old Tom's. He
      discovered that he was in Old Tom's hands completely. Andrew had thought
      that he would just frighten the women a bit, get them down to Lymport for
      a week or so, and then announce that matters were not so bad with the
      Brewery as he had feared; concluding the farce with a few domestic
      fireworks. Conceive his dismay when he entered the house, to find there a
      man in possession.
    
    
      Andrew flew into such a rage that he committed an assault on the man. So
      ungovernable was his passion, that for some minutes Harriet's measured
      voice summoned him from over the banisters above, quite in vain. The
      miserable Englishman refused to be taught that his house had ceased to be
      his castle. It was something beyond a joke, this! The intruder, perfectly
      docile, seeing that by accurate calculation every shake he got involved a
      bottle of wine for him, and ultimate compensation probably to the amount
      of a couple of sovereigns, allowed himself to be lugged up stairs, in
      default of summary ejection on the point of Andrew's toe into the street.
      There he was faced to the lady of the house, who apologized to him, and
      requested her husband to state what had made him guilty of this indecent
      behaviour. The man showed his papers. They were quite in order. 'At the
      suit of Messrs. Grist.'
    
    
      'My own lawyers!' cried Andrew, smacking his forehead; and Old Tom's
      devilry flashed on him at once. He sank into a chair.
    
    
      'Why did you bring this person up here?' said Harriet, like a speaking
      statue.
    
    
      'My dear!' Andrew answered, and spread out his hand, and waggled his head;
      'My       please!       I       I don't know. We all want exercise.'
    
    
      The man laughed, which was kindly of him, but offensive to Mrs. Cogglesby,
      who gave Andrew a glance which was full payment for his imbecile
      pleasantry, and promised more.
    
    
      With a hospitable inquiry as to the condition of his appetite, and a
      request that he would be pleased to satisfy it to the full, the man was
      dismissed: whereat, as one delivered of noxious presences, the Countess
      rustled into sight. Not noticing Andrew, she lisped to Harriet:
      'Misfortunes are sometimes no curses! I bless the catarrh that has
      confined Silva to his chamber, and saved him from a bestial exhibition.'
    
    
      The two ladies then swept from the room, and left Andrew to perspire at
      leisure.
    
    
      Fresh tribulations awaited him when he sat down to dinner. Andrew liked
      his dinner to be comfortable, good, and in plenty. This may not seem
      strange. The fact is stated that I may win for him the warm sympathies of
      the body of his countrymen. He was greeted by a piece of cold boiled neck
      of mutton and a solitary dish of steaming potatoes. The blank expanse of
      table-cloth returned his desolate stare.
    
    
      'Why, what's the meaning of this?' Andrew brutally exclaimed, as he
      thumped the table.
    
    
      The Countess gave a start, and rolled a look as of piteous supplication to
      spare a lady's nerves, addressed to a ferocious brigand. Harriet answered:
      'It means that I will have no butcher's bills.'
    
    
      'Butcher's bills! butcher's bills!' echoed Andrew; 'why, you must have
      butcher's bills; why, confound! why, you'll have a bill for this, won't
      you, Harry? eh? of course!'
    
    
      'There will be no more bills dating from yesterday,' said his wife.
    
    
      'What! this is paid for, then?'
    
    
      'Yes, Mr. Cogglesby; and so will all household expenses be, while my
      pocket-money lasts.'
    
    
      Resting his eyes full on Harriet a minute, Andrew dropped them on the
      savourless white-rimmed chop, which looked as lonely in his plate as its
      parent dish on the table. The poor dear creature's pocket-money had paid
      for it! The thought, mingling with a rush of emotion, made his ideas spin.
      His imagination surged deliriously. He fancied himself at the Zoological
      Gardens, exchanging pathetic glances with a melancholy marmoset.
      Wonderfully like one the chop looked! There was no use in his trying to
      eat it. He seemed to be fixing his teeth in solid tears. He choked. Twice
      he took up knife and fork, put them down again, and plucking forth his
      handkerchief, blew a tremendous trumpet, that sent the Countess's eyes
      rolling to the ceiling, as if heaven were her sole refuge from such
      vulgarity.
    
    
      'Damn that Old Tom!' he shouted at last, and pitched back in his chair.
    
    
      'Mr. Cogglesby!' and 'In the presence of ladies!' were the admonishing
      interjections of the sisters, at whom the little man frowned in turns.
    
    
      'Do you wish us to quit the room, sir?' inquired his wife.
    
    
      'God bless your soul, you little darling!' he apostrophized that stately
      person. 'Here, come along with me, Harry. A wife's a wife, I say       hang
      it! Just outside the room       just a second! or up in a corner will do.'
    
    
      Mrs. Cogglesby was amazed to see him jump up and run round to her. She was
      prepared to defend her neck from his caress, and refused to go: but the
      words, 'Something particular to tell you,' awakened her curiosity, which
      urged her to compliance. She rose and went with him to the door.
    
    
      'Well, sir; what is it?'
    
    
      No doubt he was acting under a momentary weakness he was about to betray
      the plot and take his chance of forgiveness; but her towering port, her
      commanding aspect, restored his courage. (There may be a contrary view of
      the case.) He enclosed her briskly in a connubial hug, and remarked with
      mad ecstasy: 'What a duck you are, Harry! What a likeness between you and
      your mother.'
    
    
      Mrs. Cogglesby disengaged herself imperiously. Had he called her aside for
      this gratuitous insult? Contrite, he saw his dreadful error.
    
    
      'Harry! I declare!' was all he was allowed to say. Mrs. Cogglesby marched
      back to her chair, and recommenced the repast in majestic silence.
    
    
      Andrew sighed; he attempted to do the same. He stuck his fork in the
      blanched whiskerage of his marmoset, and exclaimed: 'I can't!'
    
    
      He was unnoticed.
    
    
      'You do not object to plain diet?' said Harriet to Louisa.
    
    
      'Oh, no, in verity!' murmured the Countess. 'However plain it be! Absence
      of appetite, dearest. You are aware I partook of luncheon at mid-day with
      the Honourable and Reverend Mr. Duffian. You must not look condemnation at
      your Louy for that. Luncheon is not conversion!'
    
    
      Harriet observed that this might be true; but still, to her mind, it was a
      mistake to be too intimate with dangerous people. 'And besides,' she
      added, 'Mr. Duffian is no longer "the Reverend." We deprive all renegades
      of their spiritual titles. His worldly ones let him keep.'
    
    
      Her superb disdain nettled the Countess.
    
    
      'Dear Harriet!' she said, with less languor, 'You are utterly and totally
      and entirely mistaken. I tell you so positively. Renegade! The application
      of such a word to such a man! Oh! and it is false, Harriet quite! Renegade
      means one who has gone over to the Turks, my dear. I am almost certain I
      saw it in Johnson's Dictionary, or an improvement upon Johnson, by a more
      learned author. But there is the fact, if Harriet can only bring her       shall
      I say stiff-necked prejudices to envisage it?'
    
    
      Harriet granted her sister permission to apply the phrases she stood in
      need of, without impeaching her intimacy with the most learned among
      lexicographers.
    
    
      'And is there no such thing as being too severe?' the Countess resumed.
      'What our enemies call unchristian!'
    
    
      'Mr. Duffian has no cause to complain of us,' said Harriet.
    
    
      'Nor does he do so, dearest. Calumny may assail him; you may utterly
      denude him       '
    
    
      'Adam!' interposed Andrew, distractedly listening. He did not disturb the
      Countess's flow.
    
    
      'You may vilify and victimize Mr. Duffian, and strip him of the honours of
      his birth, but, like the Martyrs, he will still continue the perfect
      nobleman. Stoned, I assure you that Mr. Duffian would preserve his
      breeding. In character he is exquisite; a polish to defy misfortune.'
    
    
      'I suppose his table is good?' said Harriet, almost ruffled by the
      Countess's lecture.
    
    
      'Plate,' was remarked in the cold tone of supreme indifference.
    
    
      'Hem! good wines?' Andrew asked, waking up a little and not wishing to be
      excluded altogether.
    
    
      'All is of the very best,' the Countess pursued her eulogy, not looking at
      him.
    
    
      'Don't you think you could       eh, Harry?       manage a pint for me, my
      dear?' Andrew humbly petitioned. 'This cold water       ha! ha! my stomach
      don't like cold bathing.'
    
    
      His wretched joke rebounded from the impenetrable armour of the ladies.
    
    
      'The wine-cellar is locked,' said his wife. 'I have sealed up the key till
      an inventory can be taken by some agent of the creditors.'
    
    
      'What creditors?' roared Andrew.
    
    
      'You can have some of the servants' beer,' Mrs. Cogglesby appended.
    
    
      Andrew studied her face to see whether she really was not hoisting him
      with his own petard. Perceiving that she was sincerely acting according to
      her sense of principle, he fumed, and departed to his privacy, unable to
      stand it any longer.
    
    
      Then like a kite the Countess pounced upon his character. Would the
      Honourable and Reverend Mr. Duflian decline to participate in the sparest
      provender? Would he be guilty of the discourtesy of leaving table without
      a bow or an apology, even if reduced to extremest poverty? No, indeed!
      which showed that, under all circumstances, a gentleman was a gentleman.
      And, oh! how she pitied her poor Harriet       eternally tied to a most
      vulgar little man, without the gilding of wealth.
    
    
      'And a fool in his business to boot, dear!'
    
    
      'These comparisons do no good,' said Harriet. 'Andrew at least is not a
      renegade, and never shall be while I live. I will do my duty by him,
      however poor we are. And now, Louisa, putting my husband out of the
      question, what are your intentions? I don't understand bankruptcy, but I
      imagine they can do nothing to wife and children. My little ones must have
      a roof over their heads; and, besides, there is little Maxwell. You
      decline to go down to Lymport, of course.'
    
    
      'Decline!' cried the Countess, melodiously; 'and do not you?'
    
    
      'As far as I am concerned       yes. But I am not to think of myself.'
    
    
      The Countess meditated, and said: 'Dear Mr. Duflian has offered me his
      hospitality. Renegades are not absolutely inhuman. They may be generous. I
      have no moral doubt that Mr. Duflian would, upon my representation       dare
      I venture?'
    
    
      'Sleep in his house! break bread with him!' exclaimed Harriet. 'What do
      you think I am made of? I would perish       go to the workhouse, rather!'
    
    
      'I see you trooping there,' said the Countess, intent on the vision.
    
    
      'And have you accepted his invitation for yourself, Louisa?'
    
    
      The Countess was never to be daunted by threatening aspects. She gave her
      affirmative with calmness and a deliberate smile.
    
    
      'You are going to live with him?'
    
    
      'Live with him! What expressions! My husband accompanies me.'
    
    
      Harriet drew up.
    
    
      'I know nothing, Louisa, that could give me more pain.'
    
    
      The Countess patted Harriet's knee. 'It succeeds to bankruptcy, assuredly.
      But would you have me drag Silva to the       the shop, Harriet, love?
      Alternatives!'
    
    
      Mrs. Andrew got up and rang the bell to have the remains of their dinner
      removed. When this was done, she said,
    
    
      'Louisa, I don't know whether I am justified: you told me to-day I might
      keep my jewels, trinkets, and lace, and such like. To me, I know they do
      not belong now: but I will dispose of them to procure you an asylum
      somewhere       they will fetch, I should think, L400,       to prevent
      your going to Mr. Duffian.'
    
    
      No exhibition of great-mindedness which the Countess could perceive, ever
      found her below it.
    
    
      'Never, love, never!' she said.
    
    
      'Then, will you go to Evan?'
    
    
      'Evan? I hate him!' The olive-hued visage was dark. It brightened as she
      added, 'At least as much as my religious sentiments permit me to. A boy
      who has thwarted me at every turn!       disgraced us! Indeed, I find it
      difficult to pardon you the supposition of such a possibility as your own
      consent to look on him ever again, Harriet.'
    
    
      'You have no children,' said Mrs. Andrew.
    
    
      The Countess mournfully admitted it.
    
    
      'There lies your danger with Mr. Duffian, Louisa!'
    
    
      'What! do you doubt my virtue?' asked the Countess.
    
    
      'Pish! I fear something different. You understand me. Mr. Duflian's moral
      reputation is none of the best, perhaps.'
    
    
      'That was before he renegaded,' said the Countess.
    
    
      Harriet bluntly rejoined: 'You will leave that house a Roman Catholic.'
    
    
      'Now you have spoken,' said the Countess, pluming. 'Now let me explain
      myself. My dear, I have fought worldly battles too long and too earnestly.
      I am rightly punished. I do but quote Herbert Duffian's own words: he is
      no flatterer though you say he has such soft fingers. I am now engaged in
      a spiritual contest. He is very wealthy! I have resolved to rescue back to
      our Church what can benefit the flock of which we form a portion, so
      exceedingly!'
    
    
      At this revelation of the Countess's spiritual contest, Mrs. Andrew shook
      a worldly head.
    
    
      'You have no chance with men there, Louisa.'
    
    
      'My Harriet complains of female weakness!'
    
    
      'Yes. We are strong in our own element, Louisa. Don't be tempted out of
      it.'
    
    
      Sublime, the Countess rose:
    
    
      'Element! am I to be confined to one? What but spiritual solaces could
      assist me to live, after the degradations I have had heaped on me? I
      renounce the world. I turn my sight to realms where caste is unknown. I
      feel no shame there of being a tailor's daughter. You see, I can bring my
      tongue to name the thing in its actuality. Once, that member would have
      blistered. Confess to me that, in spite of your children, you are tempted
      to howl at the idea of Lymport       '
    
    
      The Countess paused, and like a lady about to fire off a gun, appeared to
      tighten her nerves, crying out rapidly:
    
    
      'Shop! Shears! Geese! Cabbage! Snip! Nine to a man!'
    
    
      Even as the silence after explosions of cannon, that which reigned in the
      room was deep and dreadful.
    
    
      'See,' the Countess continued, 'you are horrified you shudder. I name all
      our titles, and if I wish to be red in my cheeks, I must rouge. It is, in
      verity, as if my senseless clay were pelted, as we heard of Evan at his
      first Lymport boys' school. You remember when he told us the story? He
      lisped a trifle then. "I'm the thon of a thnip." Oh! it was hell-fire to
      us, then; but now, what do I feel? Why, I avowed it to Herbert Duffian
      openly, and he said, that the misfortune of dear Papa's birth did not the
      less enable him to proclaim himself in conduct a nobleman's offspring       '
    
    
      'Which he never was.' Harriet broke the rhapsody in a monotonous low tone:
      the Countess was not compelled to hear:
    
    
      '       and that a large outfitter       one of the very largest, was in
      reality a merchant, whose daughters have often wedded nobles of the land,
      and become ancestresses! Now, Harriet, do you see what a truly religious
      mind can do for us in the way of comfort? Oh! I bow in gratitude to
      Herbert Duffian. I will not rest till I have led him back to our fold,
      recovered from his error. He was our own preacher and pastor. He quitted
      us from conviction. He shall return to us from conviction.'
    
    
      The Countess quoted texts, which I respect, and will not repeat. She
      descanted further on spiritualism, and on the balm that it was to tailors
      and their offspring; to all outcasts from Society.
    
    
      Overpowered by her, Harriet thus summed up her opinions: 'You were always
      self-willed, Louisa.'
    
    
      'Say, full of sacrifice, if you would be just,' added the Countess; 'and
      the victim of basest ingratitude.'
    
    
      'Well, you are in a dangerous path, Louisa.'
    
    
      Harriet had the last word, which usually the Countess was not disposed to
      accord; but now she knew herself strengthened to do so, and was content to
      smile pityingly on her sister.
    
    
      Full upon them in this frame of mind, arrived Caroline's great news from
      Beckley.
    
    
      It was then that the Countess's conduct proved a memorable refutation of
      cynical philosophy: she rejoiced in the good fortune of him who had
      offended her! Though he was not crushed and annihilated (as he deserved to
      be) by the wrong he had done, the great-hearted woman pardoned him!
    
    
      Her first remark was: 'Let him thank me for it or not, I will lose no
      moment in hastening to load him with my congratulations.'
    
    
      Pleasantly she joked Andrew, and defended him from Harriet now.
    
    
      'So we are not all bankrupts, you see, dear brother-in-law.'
    
    
      Andrew had become so demoralized by his own plot, that in every turn of
      events he scented a similar piece of human ingenuity. Harriet was angry
      with his disbelief, or say, the grudging credit he gave to the glorious
      news. Notwithstanding her calmness, the thoughts of Lymport had sickened
      her soul, and it was only for the sake of her children, and from a sense
      of the dishonesty of spending a farthing of the money belonging, as she
      conceived, to the creditors, that she had consented to go.
    
    
      'I see your motive, Mr. Cogglesby,' she observed. 'Your measures are
      disconcerted. I will remain here till my brother gives me shelter.'
    
    
      'Oh, that'll do, my love; that's all I want,' said Andrew, sincerely.
    
    
      'Both of you, fools!' the Countess interjected. 'Know you Evan so little?
      He will receive us anywhere: his arms are open to his kindred: but to his
      heart the road is through humiliation, and it is to his heart we seek
      admittance.'
    
    
      'What do you mean?' Harriet inquired.
    
    
      'Just this,' the Countess answered in bold English and her eyes were
      lively, her figure elastic: 'We must all of us go down to the old shop and
      shake his hand there       every man Jack of us!       I'm only quoting
      the sailors, Harriet       and that's the way to win him.'
    
    
      She snapped her fingers, laughing. Harriet stared at her, and so did
      Andrew, though for a different reason. She seemed to be transformed.
      Seeing him inclined to gape, she ran up to him, caught up his chin between
      her ten fingers, and kissed him on both cheeks, saying:
    
    
      'You needn't come, if you're too proud, you know, little man!'
    
    
      And to Harriet's look of disgust, the cause for which she divined with her
      native rapidity, she said: 'What does it matter? They will talk, but they
      can't look down on us now. Why, this is my doing!'
    
    
      She came tripping to her tall sister, to ask plaintively 'Mayn't I be
      glad?' and bobbed a curtsey.
    
    
      Harriet desired Andrew to leave them. Flushed and indignant she then faced
      the Countess.
    
    
      'So unnecessary!' she began. 'What can excuse your indiscretion, Louisa?'
    
    
      The Countess smiled to hear her talking to her younger sister once more.
      She shrugged.
    
    
      'Oh, if you will keep up the fiction, do. Andrew knows       he isn't an
      idiot       and to him we can make light of it now. What does anybody's
      birth matter, who's well off!'
    
    
      It was impossible for Harriet to take that view. The shop, if not the
      thing, might still have been concealed from her husband, she thought.
    
    
      'It mattered to me when I was well off,' she said, sternly.
    
    
      'Yes; and to me when I was; but we've had a fall and a lesson since that,
      my dear. Half the aristocracy of England spring from shops!       Shall I
      measure you?'
    
    
      Harriet never felt such a desire to inflict a slap upon mortal cheek. She
      marched away from her in a tiff. On the other hand, Andrew was half
      fascinated by the Countess's sudden re-assumption of girlhood, and
      returned       silly fellow! to have another look at her. She had ceased,
      on reflection, to be altogether so vivacious: her stronger second nature
      had somewhat resumed its empire: still she was fresh, and could at times
      be roguishly affectionate and she patted him, and petted him, and made
      much of him; slightly railed at him for his uxoriousness and domestic
      subjection, and proffered him her fingers to try the taste of. The truth
      must be told: Mr. Duflian not being handy, she in her renewed earthly
      happiness wanted to see her charms in a woman's natural mirror: namely,
      the face of man: if of man on his knees, all the better and though a
      little man is not much of a man, and a sister's husband is, or should be,
      hardly one at all, still some sort of a reflector he must be. Two or three
      jests adapted to Andrew's palate achieved his momentary captivation.
    
    
      He said: 'Gad, I never kissed you in my life, Louy.'
    
    
      And she, with a flavour of delicate Irish brogue, 'Why don't ye catch
      opportunity by the tail, then?'
    
    
      Perfect innocence, I assure you, on both sides.
    
    
      But mark how stupidity betrays. Andrew failed to understand her, and act
      on the hint immediately. Had he done so, the affair would have been over
      without a witness. As it happened, delay permitted Harriet to assist at
      the ceremony.
    
    
      'It wasn't your mouth, Louy,' said Andrew.
    
    
      'Oh, my mouth!       that I keep for, my chosen,' was answered.
    
    
      'Gad, you make a fellow almost wish       ' Andrew's fingers worked over
      his poll, and then the spectre of righteous wrath flashed on him       naughty
      little man that he was! He knew himself naughty, for it was the only time
      since his marriage that he had ever been sorry to see his wife. This is a
      comedy, and I must not preach lessons of life here: but I am obliged to
      remark that the husband must be proof, the sister-in-law perfect, where
      arrangements exist that keep them under one roof. She may be so like his
      wife! Or, from the knowledge she has of his circumstances, she may talk to
      him almost as his wife. He may forget that she is not his wife! And then
      again, the small beginnings, which are in reality the mighty barriers, are
      so easily slid over. But what is the use of telling this to a pure
      generation? My constant error is in supposing that I write for the wicked
      people who begat us.
    
    
      Note, however, the difference between the woman and the man! Shame
      confessed Andrew's naughtiness; he sniggered pitiably: whereas the
      Countess jumped up, and pointing at him, asked her sister what she thought
      of that. Her next sentence, coolly delivered, related to some millinery
      matter. If this was not innocence, what is?
    
    
      Nevertheless, I must here state that the scene related, innocent as it
      was, and, as one would naturally imagine, of puny consequence, if any, did
      no less a thing than, subsequently, to precipitate the Protestant Countess
      de Saldar into the bosom of the Roman Catholic Church. A little bit of
      play!
    
    
      It seems barely just. But if, as I have heard, a lady has trod on a pebble
      and broken her nose, tremendous results like these warn us to be careful
      how we walk. As for play, it was never intended that we should play with
      flesh and blood.
    
    
      And, oh, be charitable, matrons of Britain! See here, Andrew Cogglesby,
      who loved his wife as his very soul, and who almost disliked her sister;
      in ten minutes the latter had set his head spinning! The whole of the day
      he went about the house meditating frantically on the possibility of his
      Harriet demanding a divorce.
    
    
      She was not the sort of woman to do that. But one thing she resolved to
      do; and it was, to go to Lymport with Louisa, and having once got her out
      of her dwelling-place, never to allow her to enter it, wherever it might
      be, in the light of a resident again. Whether anything but the menace of a
      participation in her conjugal possessions could have despatched her to
      that hateful place, I doubt. She went: she would not let Andrew be out of
      her sight. Growing haughtier toward him at every step, she advanced to the
      strange old shop. EVAN HARRINGTON over the door! There the Countess,
      having meantime returned to her state of womanhood, shared her shudders.
      They entered, and passed in to Mrs. Mel, leaving their footman,
      apparently, in the rear. Evan was not visible. A man in the shop, with a
      yard measure negligently adorning his shoulders, said that Mr. Harrington
      was in the habit of quitting the shop at five.
    
    
      'Deuced good habit, too,' said Andrew.
    
    
      'Why, sir,' observed another, stepping forward, 'as you truly say       yes.
      But       ah! Mr. Andrew Cogglesby? Pleasure of meeting you once in Fallow
      field! Remember Mr. Perkins?       the lawyer, not the maltster. Will you
      do me the favour to step out with me?'
    
    
      Andrew followed him into the street.
    
    
      'Are you aware of our young friend's good fortune?' said Lawyer Perkins.
      'Yes. Ah! Well!       Would you believe that any sane person in his
      condition, now       nonsense apart       could bring his mind wilfully to
      continue a beggar? No. Um! Well; Mr. Cogglesby, I may tell you that I hold
      here in my hands a document by which Mr. Evan Harrington transfers the
      whole of the property bequeathed to him to Lady Jocelyn, and that I have
      his orders to execute it instantly, and deliver it over to her ladyship,
      after the will is settled, probate, and so forth: I presume there will be
      an arrangement about his father's debts. Now what do you think of that?'
    
    
      'Think, sir,       think!' cried Andrew, cocking his head at him like an
      indignant bird, 'I think he's a damned young idiot to do so, and you're a
      confounded old rascal to help him.'
    
    
      Leaving Mr. Perkins to digest his judgement, which he had solicited,
      Andrew bounced back into the shop.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XLV. IN WHICH THE SHOP BECOMES THE CENTRE OF ATTRACTION
    
    
      Under the first lustre of a May-night, Evan was galloping over the
      moon-shadowed downs toward Beckley. At the ridge commanding the woods, the
      park, and the stream, his horse stopped, as if from habit, snorted, and
      puffed its sides, while he gazed steadily across the long lighted vale.
      Soon he began to wind down the glaring chalk-track, and reached grass
      levels. Here he broke into a round pace, till, gaining the first
      straggling cottages of the village, he knocked the head of his whip
      against the garden-gate of one, and a man came out, who saluted him, and
      held the reins.
    
    
      'Animal does work, sir,' said the man.
    
    
      Evan gave directions for it to be looked to, and went on to the doorway,
      where he was met by a young woman. She uttered a respectful greeting, and
      begged him to enter.
    
    
      The door closed, he flung himself into a chair, and said:
    
    
      'Well, Susan, how is the child?'
    
    
      'Oh! he's always well, Mr. Harrington; he don't know the tricks o' trouble
      yet.'
    
    
      'Will Polly be here soon?'
    
    
      'At a quarter after nine, she said, sir.'
    
    
      Evan bade her sit down. After examining her features quietly, he said:
    
    
      'I 'm glad to see you here, Susan. You don't regret that you followed my
      advice?'
    
    
      'No, sir; now it's over, I don't. Mother's kind enough, and father doesn't
      mention anything. She's a-bed with bile       father's out.'
    
    
      'But what? There's something on your mind.'
    
    
      'I shall cry, if I begin, Mr. Harrington.'
    
    
      'See how far you can get without.'
    
    
      'Oh! Sir, then,' said Susan, on a sharp rise of her bosom, 'it ain't my
      fault. I wouldn't cause trouble to Mr. Harry, or any friend of yours; but,
      sir, father have got hold of his letters to me, and he says, there 's a
      promise in 'em       least, one of 'em; and it's as good as law, he says       he
      heard it in a public-house; and he's gone over to Fall'field to a
      law-gentleman there.' Susan was compelled to give way to some sobs. 'It
      ain't for me       father does it, sir,' she pleaded. 'I tried to stop
      him, knowing how it'd vex you, Mr. Harrington; but he's heady about
      points, though a quiet man ordinary; and he says he don't expect       and
      I know now no gentleman 'd marry such as me       I ain't such a stupid
      gaper at words as I used to be; but father says it's for the child's sake,
      and he does it to have him provided for. Please, don't ye be angry with
      me, sir.'
    
    
      Susan's half-controlled spasms here got the better of her.
    
    
      While Evan was awaiting the return of her calmer senses, the latch was
      lifted, and Polly appeared.
    
    
      'At it again!' was her sneering comment, after a short survey of her
      apron-screened sister; and then she bobbed to Evan.
    
    
      'It's whimper, whimper, and squeak, squeak, half their lives with some
      girls. After that they go wondering they can't see to thread a needle! The
      neighbours, I suppose. I should like to lift the top off some o' their
      houses. I hope I haven't kept you, sir.'
    
    
      'No, Polly,' said Evan; 'but you must be charitable, or I shall think you
      want a lesson yourself. Mr. Raikes tells me you want to see me. What is
      it? You seem to be correspondents.'
    
    
      Polly replied: 'Oh, no, Mr. Harrington: only accidental ones       when
      something particular's to be said. And he dances-like on the paper, so
      that you can't help laughing. Isn't he a very eccentric gentleman, sir?'
    
    
      'Very,' said Evan. 'I 've no time to lose, Polly.'
    
    
      'Here, you must go,' the latter called to her sister. 'Now pack at once,
      Sue. Do rout out, and do leave off thinking you've got a candle at your
      eyes, for Goodness' sake!'
    
    
      Susan was too well accustomed to Polly's usage to complain. She murmured a
      gentle 'Good night, sir,' and retired. Whereupon Polly exclaimed: 'Bless
      her poor dear soft heart! It 's us hard ones that get on best in the
      world. I'm treated better than her, Mr. Harrington, and I know I ain't
      worth half of her. It goes nigh to make one religious, only to see how
      exactly like Scripture is the way Beckley treats her, whose only sin is
      her being so soft as to believe in a man! Oh, dear! Mr. Harrington! I wish
      I had good news for you.'
    
    
      In spite of all his self-control, Evan breathed quickly and looked
      eagerly.
    
    
      'Speak it out, Polly.'
    
    
      'Oh, dear! I must, I suppose,' Polly answered. 'Mr. Laxley's become a lord
      now, Mr. Harrington.'
    
    
      Evan tasted in his soul the sweets of contrast. 'Well?'
    
    
      'And my Miss Rose       she       '
    
    
      'What?'
    
    
      Moved by the keen hunger of his eyes, Polly hesitated. Her face betrayed a
      sudden change of mind.
    
    
      'Wants to see you, sir,' she said, resolutely.
    
    
      'To see me?'
    
    
      Evan stood up, so pale that Polly was frightened.
    
    
      'Where is she? Where can I meet her?'
    
    
      'Please don't take it so, Mr. Harrington.'
    
    
      Evan commanded her to tell him what her mistress had said.
    
    
      Now up to this point Polly had spoken truth. She was positive her mistress
      did want to see him. Polly, also, with a maiden's tender guile, desired to
      bring them together for once, though it were for the last time, and for no
      good on earth. She had been about to confide to him her young mistress's
      position toward Lord Laxley, when his sharp interrogation stopped her.
      Shrinking from absolute invention, she remarked that of course she could
      not exactly remember Miss Rose's words; which seemed indeed too much to
      expect of her.
    
    
      'She will see me to-night?' said Evan.
    
    
      'I don't know about to-night,' Polly replied.
    
    
      'Go to her instantly. Tell her I am ready. I will be at the West
      park-gates. This is why you wrote, Polly? Why did you lose time? Don't
      delay, my good girl! Come!'
    
    
      Evan had opened the door. He would not allow Polly an instant for
      expostulation; but drew her out, saying, 'You will attend to the gates
      yourself. Or come and tell me the day, if she appoints another.'
    
    
      Polly made a final effort to escape from the pit she was being pushed
      into.
    
    
      'Mr. Harrington! it wasn't to tell you this I wrote.
    
    
      Miss Rose is engaged, sir.'
    
    
      'I understand,' said Evan, hoarsely, scarcely feeling it, as is the case
      with men who are shot through the heart.
    
    
      Ten minutes later he was on horseback by the Fallow field gates, with the
      tidings shrieking through his frame. The night was still, and stiller in
      the pauses of the nightingales. He sat there, neither thinking of them nor
      reproached in his manhood for the tears that rolled down his cheeks.
      Presently his horse's ears pricked, and the animal gave a low neigh.
      Evan's eyes fixed harder on the length of gravel leading to the house.
      There was no sign, no figure. Out from the smooth grass of the lane a
      couple of horsemen issued, and came straight to the gates. He heard
      nothing till one spoke. It was a familiar voice.
    
    
      'By Jove, Ferdy, here is the fellow, and we've been all the way to
      Lymport!'
    
    
      Evan started from his trance.
    
    
      'It 's you, Harrington?'
    
    
      'Yes, Harry.'
    
    
      'Sir!' exclaimed that youth, evidently flushed with wine, 'what the devil
      do you mean by addressing me by my Christian name?'
    
    
      Laxley pushed his horse's head in front of Harry. In a manner apparently
      somewhat improved by his new dignity, he said: 'We have ridden to Lymport
      to speak to you, sir. Favour me by moving a little ahead of the lodge.'
    
    
      Evan bowed, and moved beside him a short way down the lane, Harry
      following.
    
    
      'The purport of my visit, sir,' Laxley began, 'was to make known to you
      that Miss Jocelyn has done me the honour to accept me as her husband. I
      learn from her that during the term of your residence in the house, you
      contrived to extract from her a promise to which she attaches certain
      scruples. She pleases to consider herself bound to you till you release
      her. My object is to demand that you will do so immediately.'
    
    
      There was no reply.
    
    
      'Should you refuse to make this reparation for the harm you have done to
      her and her family,' Laxley pursued, 'I must let you know that there are
      means of compelling you to it, and that those means will be employed.'
    
    
      Harry, fuming at these postured sentences, burst out:
    
    
      'What do you talk to the fellow in that way for? A fellow who makes a fool
      of my cousin, and then wants to get us to buy off my sister! What's he
      spying after here? The place is ours till we troop. I tell you there's
      only one way of dealing with him, and if you don't do it, I will.'
    
    
      Laxley pulled his reins with a jerk that brought him to the rear.
    
    
      'Miss Jocelyn has commissioned you to make this demand on me in her name?'
      said Evan.
    
    
      'I make it in my own right,' returned       Laxley. 'I demand a prompt
      reply.'
    
    
      'My lord, you shall have it. Miss Jocelyn is not bound to me by any
      engagement. Should she entertain scruples which I may have it in my power
      to obliterate, I shall not hesitate to do so       but only to her. What
      has passed between us I hold sacred.'
    
    
      'Hark at that!' shouted Harry. 'The damned tradesman means money! You ass,
      Ferdinand! What did we go to Lymport for? Not to bandy words. Here! I've
      got my own quarrel with you, Harrington. You've been setting that girl's
      father on me. Can you deny that?'
    
    
      It was enough for Harry that Evan did not deny it. The calm disdain which
      he read on Evan's face acted on his fury, and digging his heels into his
      horse's flanks he rushed full at him and dealt him a sharp flick with his
      whip. Evan's beast reared.
    
    
      'Accept my conditions, sir, or afford me satisfaction,' cried Laxley.
    
    
      'You do me great honour, my lord; but I have told you I cannot,' said
      Evan, curbing his horse.
    
    
      At that moment Rose came among them. Evan raised his hat, as did Laxley.
      Harry, a little behind the others, performed a laborious mock salute, and
      then ordered her back to the house. A quick altercation ensued; the end
      being that Harry managed to give his sister the context of the previous
      conversation.
    
    
      'Now go back, Rose,' said Laxley. 'I have particular business with Mr.
      Harrington.'
    
    
      'I came to see him,' said Rose, in a clear voice.
    
    
      Laxley reddened angrily.
    
    
      'Then tell him at once you want to be rid of him,' her brother called to
      her.
    
    
      Rose looked at Evan. Could he not see that she had no word in her soul for
      him of that kind? Yes: but love is not always to be touched to tenderness
      even at the sight of love.
    
    
      'Rose,' he said, 'I hear from Lord Laxley, that you fancy yourself not at
      liberty; and that you require me to disengage you.'
    
    
      He paused. Did he expect her to say there that she wished nothing of the
      sort? Her stedfast eyes spoke as much: but misery is wanton, and will pull
      all down to it. Even Harry was checked by his tone, and Laxley sat silent.
      The fact that something more than a tailor was speaking seemed to impress
      them.
    
    
      'Since I have to say it, Rose, I hold you in no way bound to me. The
      presumption is forced upon me. May you have all the happiness I pray God
      to give you.
    
    
      Gentlemen, good night!'
    
    
      He bowed and was gone. How keenly she could have retorted on that false
      prayer for her happiness! Her limbs were nerveless, her tongue speechless.
      He had thrown her off       there was no barrier now between herself and
      Ferdinand. Why did Ferdinand speak to her with that air of gentle
      authority, bidding her return to the house? She was incapable of seeing,
      what the young lord acutely felt, that he had stooped very much in helping
      to bring about such a scene. She had no idea of having trifled with him
      and her own heart, when she talked feebly of her bondage to another, as
      one who would be warmer to him were she free. Swiftly she compared the two
      that loved her, and shivered as if she had been tossed to the embrace of a
      block of ice.
    
    
      'You are cold, Rose,' said Laxley, bending to lay his hand on her
      shoulder.
    
    
      'Pray, never touch me,' she answered, and walked on hastily to the house.
    
    
      Entering it, she remembered that Evan had dwelt there. A sense of
      desolation came over her. She turned to Ferdinand remorsefully, saying:
      'Dear Ferdinand!' and allowed herself to be touched and taken close to
      him. When she reached her bed-room, she had time to reflect that he had
      kissed her on the lips, and then she fell down and shed such tears as had
      never been drawn from her before.
    
    
      Next day she rose with an undivided mind. Belonging henceforth to
      Ferdinand, it was necessary that she should invest him immediately with
      transcendent qualities. The absence of character in him rendered this
      easy. What she had done for Evan, she did for him. But now, as if the
      Fates had been lying in watch to entrap her and chain her, that they might
      have her at their mercy, her dreams of Evan's high nature       hitherto
      dreams only       were to be realized. With the purposeless waywardness of
      her sex, Pony Wheedle, while dressing her young mistress, and though quite
      aware that the parting had been spoken, must needs relate her sister's
      story and Evan's share in it. Rose praised him like one forever aloof from
      him. Nay, she could secretly congratulate herself on not being deceived.
      Upon that came a letter from Caroline:
    
    
      'Do not misjudge my brother. He knew Juliana's love for him and rejected
      it. You will soon have proofs of his disinterestedness. Then do not forget
      that he works to support us all. I write this with no hope save to make
      you just to him. That is the utmost he will ever anticipate.'
    
    
      It gave no beating of the heart to Rose to hear good of Evan now: but an
      increased serenity of confidence in the accuracy of her judgement of
      persons.
    
    
      The arrival of Lawyer Perkins supplied the key to Caroline's
      communication. No one was less astonished than Rose at the news that Evan
      renounced the estate. She smiled at Harry's contrite stupefaction, and her
      father's incapacity of belief in conduct so singular, caused her to lift
      her head and look down on her parent.
    
    
      'Shows he knows nothing of the world, poor young fellow!' said Sir Franks.
    
    
      'Nothing more clearly,' observed Lady Jocelyn. 'I presume I shall cease to
      be blamed for having had him here?'
    
    
      'Upon my honour, he must have the soul of a gentleman!' said the baronet.
      'There's nothing he can expect in return, you know!'
    
    
      'One would think, Papa, you had always been dealing with tradesmen!'
      remarked Rose, to whom her father now accorded the treatment due to a
      sensible girl.
    
    
      Laxley was present at the family consultation. What was his opinion? Rose
      manifested a slight anxiety to hear it.
    
    
      'What those sort of fellows do never surprises me,' he said, with a
      semi-yawn.
    
    
      Rose felt fire on her cheeks.
    
    
      'It's only what the young man is bound to do,' said Mrs. Shorne.
    
    
      'His duty, aunt? I hope we may all do it!' Rose interjected.
    
    
      'Championing him again?'
    
    
      Rose quietly turned her face, too sure of her cold appreciation of him to
      retort. But yesterday night a word from him might have made her his; and
      here she sat advocating the nobility of his nature with the zeal of a
      barrister in full swing of practice. Remember, however, that a kiss
      separates them: and how many millions of leagues that counts for in love,
      in a pure girl's thought, I leave you to guess.
    
    
      Now, in what way was Evan to be thanked? how was he to be treated? Sir
      Franks proposed to go down to him in person, accompanied by Harry. Lady
      Jocelyn acquiesced. But Rose said to her mother:
    
    
      'Will not you wound his sensitiveness by going to him there?'
    
    
      'Possibly,' said her ladyship. 'Shall we write and ask him to come to us?'
    
    
      'No, Mama. Could we ask him to make a journey to receive our thanks?'
    
    
      'Not till we have solid ones to offer, perhaps.'
    
    
      'He will not let us help him, Mama, unless we have all given him our
      hands.'
    
    
      'Probably not. There's always a fund of nonsense in those who are capable
      of great things, I observe. It shall be a family expedition, if you like.'
    
    
      'What!' exclaimed Mrs. Shorne. 'Do you mean that you intend to allow Rose
      to make one of the party? Franks! is that your idea?'
    
    
      Sir Franks looked at his wife.
    
    
      'What harm?' Lady Jocelyn asked; for Rose's absence of conscious guile in
      appealing to her reason had subjugated that great faculty.
    
    
      'Simply a sense of propriety, Emily,' said Mrs. Shorne, with a glance at
      Ferdinand.
    
    
      'You have no objection, I suppose!' Lady Jocelyn addressed him.
    
    
      'Ferdinand will join us,' said Rose.
    
    
      'Thank you, Rose, I'd rather not,' he replied. 'I thought we had done with
      the fellow for good last night.'
    
    
      'Last night?' quoth Lady Jocelyn.
    
    
      No one spoke. The interrogation was renewed. Was it Rose's swift instinct
      which directed her the shortest way to gain her point? or that she was
      glad to announce that her degrading engagement was at an end? She said:
    
    
      'Ferdinand and Mr. Harrington came to an understanding last night, in my
      presence.'
    
    
      That, strange as it struck on their ears, appeared to be quite sufficient
      to all, albeit the necessity for it was not so very clear. The carriage
      was ordered forthwith; Lady Jocelyn went to dress; Rose drew Ferdinand
      away into the garden. Then, with all her powers, she entreated him to join
      her.
    
    
      'Thank you, Rose,' he said; 'I have no taste for the genus.'
    
    
      'For my sake, I beg it, Ferdinand.'
    
    
      'It's really too much to ask of me, Rose.'
    
    
      'If you care for me, you will.'
    
    
      ''Pon my honour, quite impossible!'
    
    
      'You refuse, Ferdinand?'
    
    
      'My London tailor 'd find me out, and never forgive me.'
    
    
      This pleasantry stopped her soft looks. Why she wished him to be with her,
      she could not have said. For a thousand reasons: which implies no distinct
      one something prophetically pressing in her blood.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XLVI. A LOVERS' PARTING
    
    
      Now, to suppose oneself the fashioner of such a chain of events as this
      which brought the whole of the Harrington family in tender unity together
      once more, would have elated an ordinary mind. But to the Countess de
      Saldar, it was simply an occasion for reflecting that she had
      misunderstood       and could most sincerely forgive       Providence. She
      admitted to herself that it was not entirely her work; for she never would
      have had their place of meeting to be the Shop. Seeing, however, that her
      end was gained, she was entitled to the credit of it, and could pardon the
      means adopted. Her brother lord of Beckley Court, and all of them
      assembled in the old 193, Main Street, Lymport! What matter for proud
      humility! Providence had answered her numerous petitions, but in its own
      way. Stipulating that she must swallow this pill, Providence consented to
      serve her. She swallowed it with her wonted courage. In half an hour
      subsequent to her arrival at Lymport, she laid siege to the heart of Old
      Tom Cogglesby, whom she found installed in the parlour, comfortably
      sipping at a tumbler of rum-and-water. Old Tom was astonished to meet such
      an agreeable unpretentious woman, who talked of tailors and lords with
      equal ease, appeared to comprehend a man's habits instinctively, and could
      amuse him while she ministered to them.
    
    
      'Can you cook, ma'am?' asked Old Tom.
    
    
      'All but that,' said the Countess, with a smile of sweet meaning.
    
    
      'Ha! then you won't suit me as well as your mother.'
    
    
      'Take care you do not excite my emulation,' she returned, graciously,
      albeit disgusted at his tone.
    
    
      To Harriet, Old Tom had merely nodded. There he sat, in the arm-chair,
      sucking the liquor, with the glimpse of a sour chuckle on his cheeks. Now
      and then, during the evening, he rubbed his hands sharply, but spoke
      little. The unbending Harriet did not conceal her disdain of him. When he
      ventured to allude to the bankruptcy, she cut him short.
    
    
      'Pray, excuse me       I am unacquainted with affairs of business       I
      cannot even understand my husband.'
    
    
      'Lord bless my soul!' Old Tom exclaimed, rolling his eyes.
    
    
      Caroline had informed her sisters up-stairs that their mother was ignorant
      of Evan's change of fortune, and that Evan desired her to continue so for
      the present. Caroline appeared to be pained by the subject, and was glad
      when Louisa sounded his mysterious behaviour by saying:
    
    
      'Evan has a native love of concealment       he must be humoured.'
    
    
      At the supper, Mr. Raikes made his bow. He was modest and reserved. It was
      known that this young gentleman acted as shopman there. With a tenderness
      for his position worthy of all respect, the Countess spared his feelings
      by totally ignoring his presence; whereat he, unaccustomed to such
      great-minded treatment, retired to bed, a hater of his kind. Harriet and
      Caroline went next. The Countess said she would wait up for Evan, but
      hearing that his hours of return were about the chimes of matins, she
      cried exultingly: 'Darling Papa all over!' and departed likewise. Mrs.
      Mel, when she had mixed Old Tom's third glass, wished the brothers good
      night, and they were left to exchange what sentiments they thought proper
      for the occasion. The Countess had certainly, disappointed Old Tom's
      farce, in a measure; and he expressed himself puzzled by her. 'You ain't
      the only one,' said his brother. Andrew, with some effort, held his tongue
      concerning the news of Evan       his fortune and his folly, till he could
      talk to the youth in person.
    
    
      All took their seats at the early breakfast next morning.
    
    
      'Has Evan not come       home yet?' was the Countess's first question.
    
    
      Mrs. Mel replied, 'No.'
    
    
      'Do you know where he has gone, dear Mama?'
    
    
      'He chooses his own way.'
    
    
      'And you fear that it leads somewhere?' added the Countess.
    
    
      'I fear that it leads to knocking up the horse he rides.'
    
    
      'The horse, Mama! He is out on a horse all night! But don't you see, dear
      old pet! his morals, at least, are safe on horseback.'
    
    
      'The horse has to be paid for, Louisa,' said her mother, sternly; and
      then, for she had a lesson to read to the guests of her son, 'Ready money
      doesn't come by joking. What will the creditors think? If he intends to be
      honest in earnest, he must give up four-feet mouths.'
    
    
      'Fourteen-feet, ma'am, you mean,' said Old Tom, counting the heads at
      table.
    
    
      'Bravo, Mama!' cried the Countess, and as she was sitting near her mother,
      she must show how prettily she kissed, by pouting out her playful lips to
      her parent. 'Do be economical always! And mind! for the sake of the
      wretched animals, I will intercede for you to be his inspector of
      stables.'
    
    
      This, with a glance of intelligence at her sisters.
    
    
      'Well, Mr. Raikes,' said Andrew, 'you keep good hours, at all events       eh?'
    
    
      'Up with the lark,' said Old Tom. 'Ha! 'fraid he won't be so early when he
      gets rid of his present habits       eh?'
    
    
      'Nec dierum numerum, ut nos, sed noctium computant,' said Mr. Raikes, and
      both the brothers sniffed like dogs that have put their noses to a hot
      coal, and the Countess, who was less insensible to the aristocracy of the
      dead languages than are women generally, gave him the recognition that is
      occasionally afforded the family tutor.
    
    
      About the hour of ten Evan arrived. He was subjected to the hottest
      embrace he had ever yet received from his sister Louisa.
    
    
      'Darling!' she called him before them all. 'Oh! how I suffer for this
      ignominy I see you compelled for a moment to endure. But it is but for a
      moment. They must vacate; and you will soon be out of this horrid hole.'
    
    
      'Where he just said he was glad to give us a welcome,' muttered Old Tom.
    
    
      Evan heard him, and laughed. The Countess laughed too.
    
    
      'No, we will not be impatient. We are poor insignificant people!' she
      said; and turning to her mother, added: 'And yet I doubt not you think the
      smallest of our landed gentry equal to great continental seigneurs. I do
      not say the contrary.'
    
    
      'You will fill Evan's head with nonsense till you make him knock up a
      horse a week, and never go to his natural bed,' said Mrs. Mel, angrily.
      'Look at him! Is a face like that fit for business?'
    
    
      'Certainly, certainly not!' said the Countess.
    
    
      'Well, Mother, the horse is dismissed,       you won't have to complain
      any more,' said Evan, touching her hand. 'Another history commences from
      to-day.'
    
    
      The Countess watched him admiringly. Such powers of acting she could not
      have ascribed to him.
    
    
      'Another history, indeed!' she said. 'By the way, Van, love! was it out of
      Glamorganshire       were we Tudors, according to Papa? or only Powys
      chieftains? It's of no moment, but it helps one in conversation.'
    
    
      'Not half so much as good ale, though!' was Old Tom's comment.
    
    
      The Countess did not perceive its fitness, till Evan burst into a laugh,
      and then she said:
    
    
      'Oh! we shall never be ashamed of the Brewery. Do not fear that, Mr.
      Cogglesby.'
    
    
      Old Tom saw his farce reviving, and encouraged the Countess to patronize
      him. She did so to an extent that called on her Mrs. Mel's reprobation,
      which was so cutting and pertinent, that Harriet was compelled to defend
      her sister, remarking that perhaps her mother would soon learn that Louisa
      was justified in not permitting herself and family to be classed too low.
      At this Andrew, coming from a private interview with Evan, threw up his
      hands and eyes as one who foretold astonishment but counselled humility.
      What with the effort of those who knew a little to imply a great deal; of
      those who knew all to betray nothing; and of those who were kept in
      ignorance to strain a fact out of the conflicting innuendos the general
      mystification waxed apace, and was at its height, when a name struck on
      Evan's ear that went through his blood like a touch of the torpedo.
    
    
      He had been called into the parlour to assist at a consultation over the
      Brewery affairs. Raikes opened the door, and announced, 'Sir Franks and
      Lady Jocelyn.'
    
    
      Them he could meet, though it was hard for his pride to pardon their visit
      to him there. But when his eyes discerned Rose behind them, the passions
      of his lower nature stood up armed. What could she have come for but to
      humiliate, or play with him?
    
    
      A very few words enabled the Countess to guess the cause for this visit.
      Of course, it was to beg time! But they thanked Evan. For something
      generous, no doubt.
    
    
      Sir Franks took him aside, and returning remarked to his wife that she
      perhaps would have greater influence with him. All this while Rose sat
      talking to Mrs. Andrew Cogglesby, Mrs. Strike, and Evan's mother. She saw
      by his face the offence she had committed, and acted on by one of her
      impulses, said: 'Mama, I think if I were to speak to Mr. Harrington       '
    
    
      Ere her mother could make light of the suggestion, Old Tom had jumped up,
      and bowed out his arm.
    
    
      'Allow me to conduct ye to the drawing room, upstairs, young lady. He'll
      follow, safe enough!'
    
    
      Rose had not stipulated for that. Nevertheless, seeing no cloud on her
      mother's face, or her father's, she gave Old Tom her hand, and awaited a
      movement from Evan. It was too late to object to it on either side. Old
      Tom had caught the tide at the right instant. Much as if a grim old genie
      had planted them together, the lovers found themselves alone.
    
    
      'Evan, you forgive me?' she began, looking up at him timidly.
    
    
      'With all my heart, Rose,' he answered, with great cheerfulness.
    
    
      'No. I know your heart better. Oh, Evan! you must be sure that we respect
      you too much to wound you. We came to thank you for your generosity. Do
      you refuse to accept anything from us? How can we take this that you
      thrust on us, unless in some way       '
    
    
      'Say no more,' he interposed. 'You see me here. You know me as I am, now.'
    
    
      'Yes, yes!' the tears stood in her eyes. 'Why did I come, you would ask?
      That is what you cannot forgive! I see now how useless it was. Evan! why
      did you betray me?'
    
    
      'Betray you, Rose?'
    
    
      'You said that you loved me once.'
    
    
      She was weeping, and all his spirit melted, and his love cried out: 'I
      said "till death," and till death it will be, Rose.'
    
    
      'Then why, why did you betray me, Evan? I know it all. But if you
      blackened yourself to me, was it not because you loved something better
      than me? And now you think me false! Which of us two has been false? It 's
      silly to talk of these things now too late! But be just. I wish that we
      may be friends. Can we, unless you bend a little?'
    
    
      The tears streamed down her cheeks, and in her lovely humility he saw the
      baseness of that pride of his which had hitherto held him up.
    
    
      'Now that you are in this house where I was born and am to live, can you
      regret what has come between us, Rose?'
    
    
      Her lips quivered in pain.
    
    
      'Can I do anything else but regret it all my life, Evan?'
    
    
      How was it possible for him to keep his strength?
    
    
      'Rose!' he spoke with a passion that made her shrink, 'are you bound to
      this man?' and to the drooping of her eyes, 'No. Impossible, for you do
      not love him. Break it. Break the engagement you cannot fulfil. Break it
      and belong to me. It sounds ill for me to say that in such a place. But
      Rose, I will leave it. I will accept any assistance that your father       that
      any man will give me. Beloved       noble girl! I see my falseness to you,
      though I little thought it at the time       fool that I was! Be my help,
      my guide-as the soul of my body! Be mine!'
    
    
      'Oh, Evan!' she clasped her hands in terror at the change in him, that was
      hurrying her she knew not whither, and trembling, held them
      supplicatingly.
    
    
      'Yes, Rose: you have taught me what love can be. You cannot marry that
      man.'
    
    
      'But, my honour, Evan! No. I do not love him; for I can love but one. He
      has my pledge. Can I break it?'
    
    
      The stress on the question choked him, just as his heart sprang to her.
    
    
      'Can you face the world with me, Rose?'
    
    
      'Oh, Evan! is there an escape for me? Think Decide!       No       no!
      there is not. My mother, I know, looks on it so. Why did she trust me to
      be with you here, but that she thinks me engaged to him, and has such
      faith in me? Oh, help me!       be my guide. Think whether you would trust
      me hereafter! I should despise myself.'
    
    
      Not if you marry him!' said Evan, bitterly. And then thinking as men will
      think when they look on the figure of a fair girl marching serenely to a
      sacrifice, the horrors of which they insist that she ought to know:
      half-hating her for her calmness       adoring her for her innocence: he
      said: 'It rests with you, Rose. The world will approve you, and if your
      conscience does, why       farewell, and may heaven be your help.'
    
    
      She murmured, 'Farewell.'
    
    
      Did she expect more to be said by him? What did she want or hope for now?
      And yet a light of hunger grew in her eyes, brighter and brighter, as it
      were on a wave of yearning.
    
    
      'Take my hand once,' she faltered.
    
    
      Her hand and her whole shape he took, and she with closed eyes let him
      strain her to his breast.
    
    
      Their swoon was broken by the opening of the door, where Old Tom Cogglesby
      and Lady Jocelyn appeared.
    
    
      'Gad! he seems to have got his recompense       eh, my lady?' cried Old
      Tom. However satisfactorily they might have explained the case, it
      certainly did seem so.
    
    
      Lady Jocelyn looked not absolutely displeased. Old Tom was chuckling at
      her elbow. The two principal actors remained dumb.
    
    
      'I suppose, if we leave young people to settle a thing, this is how they
      do it,' her ladyship remarked.
    
    
      'Gad, and they do it well!' cried Old Tom.
    
    
      Rose, with a deep blush on her cheeks, stepped from Evan to her mother.
      Not in effrontery, but earnestly, and as the only way of escaping from the
      position, she said: 'I have succeeded, Mama. He will take what I offer.'
    
    
      'And what's that, now?' Old Tom inquired.
    
    
      Rose turned to Evan. He bent and kissed her hand.
    
    
      'Call it "recompense" for the nonce,' said Lady Jocelyn. 'Do you still
      hold to your original proposition, Tom?'
    
    
      'Every penny, my lady. I like the young fellow, and she's a jolly little
      lass       if she means it:       she's a woman.'
    
    
      'True,' said Lady Jocelyn. 'Considering that fact, you will oblige me by
      keeping the matter quiet.'
    
    
      'Does she want to try whether the tailor's a gentleman still, my lady-eh?'
    
    
      'No. I fancy she will have to see whether a certain nobleman may be one.'
    
    
      The Countess now joined them. Sir Franks had informed her of her brother's
      last fine performance. After a short, uneasy pause, she said, glancing at
      Evan:       
    
    
      'You know his romantic nature. I can assure you he was sincere; and even
      if you could not accept, at least       '
    
    
      'But we have accepted, Countess,' said Rose.
    
    
      'The estate!'
    
    
      'The estate, Countess. And what is more, to increase the effect of his
      generosity, he has consented to take a recompense.'
    
    
      'Indeed!' exclaimed the Countess, directing a stony look at her brother.
    
    
      'May I presume to ask what recompense?'
    
    
      Rose shook her head. 'Such a very poor one, Countess! He has no idea of
      relative value.'
    
    
      The Countess's great mind was just then running hot on estates, and
      thousands, or she would not have played goose to them, you may be sure.
      She believed that Evan had been wheedled by Rose into the acceptance of a
      small sum of money, in return for his egregious gift.
    
    
      With an internal groan, the outward aspect of which she had vast
      difficulty in masking, she said: 'You are right       he has no head.
      Easily cajoled!'
    
    
      Old Tom sat down in a chair, and laughed outright. Lady Jocelyn, in pity
      for the poor lady, who always amused her, thought it time to put an end to
      the scene.
    
    
      'I hope your brother will come to us in about a week,' she said. 'May I
      expect the favour of your company as well?'
    
    
      The Countess felt her dignity to be far superior as she responded: 'Lady
      Jocelyn, when next I enjoy the gratification of a visit to your hospitable
      mansion, I must know that I am not at a disadvantage. I cannot consent to
      be twice pulled down to my brother's level.'
    
    
      Evan's heart was too full of its dim young happiness to speak, or care for
      words. The cold elegance of the Countess's curtsey to Lady Jocelyn: her
      ladyship's kindly pressure of his hand: Rose's stedfast look into his
      eyes: Old Tom's smothered exclamation that he was not such a fool as he
      seemed: all passed dream-like, and when he was left to the fury of the
      Countess, he did not ask her to spare him, nor did he defend himself. She
      bade adieu to him and their mutual relationship that very day. But her
      star had not forsaken her yet. Chancing to peep into the shop, to intrust
      a commission to Mr. John Raikes, who was there doing penance for his
      career as a gentleman, she heard Old Tom and Andrew laughing, utterly
      unlike bankrupts.
    
    
      'Who 'd have thought the women such fools! and the Countess, too!'
    
    
      This was Andrew's voice. He chuckled as one emancipated. The Countess had
      a short interview with him (before she took her departure to join her
      husband, under the roof of the Honourable Herbert Duffian), and Andrew
      chuckled no more.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XLVII. A YEAR LATER
    
    
      THE COUNTESS DE SALDAR DE SANCORVO TO HER SISTER CAROLINE
    

                       'Rome.
'Let the post-mark be my reply to your letter received through the
Consulate, and most courteously delivered with the Consul's compliments.
We shall yet have an ambassador at Rome       mark your Louisa's words. Yes,
dearest! I am here, body and spirit! I have at last found a haven, a
refuge, and let those who condemn me compare the peace of their spirits
with mine. You think that you have quite conquered the dreadfulness of
our origin. My love, I smile at you! I know it to be impossible for
the Protestant heresy to offer a shade of consolation. Earthly-born,
it rather encourages earthly distinctions. It is the sweet sovereign
Pontiff alone who gathers all in his arms, not excepting tailors. Here,
if they could know it, is their blessed comfort!

    
      'Thank Harriet for her message. She need say nothing. By refusing me her
      hospitality, when she must have known that the house was as free of
      creditors as any foreigner under the rank of Count is of soap, she drove
      me to Mr. Duflian. Oh! how I rejoice at her exceeding unkindness! How
      warmly I forgive her the unsisterly       to say the least       vindictiveness
      of her unaccountable conduct! Her sufferings will one day be terrible.
      Good little Andrew supplies her place to me. Why do you refuse his easily
      afforded bounty? No one need know of it. I tell you candidly, I take
      double, and the small good punch of a body is only too delighted. But
      then, I can be discreet.
    
    
      'Oh! the gentlemanliness of these infinitely maligned Jesuits! They remind
      me immensely of Sir Charles Grandison, and those frontispiece pictures to
      the novels we read when girls       I mean in manners and the ideas they
      impose       not in dress or length of leg, of course. The same winning
      softness; the same irresistible ascendancy over the female mind! They
      require virtue for two, I assure you, and so I told Silva, who laughed.
    
    
      'But the charms of confession, my dear! I will talk of Evan first. I have
      totally forgiven him. Attache to the Naples embassy, sounds tol-lol. In
      such a position I can rejoice to see him, for it permits me to acknowledge
      him. I am not sure that, spiritually, Rose will be his most fitting
      helpmate. However, it is done, and I did it, and there is no more to be
      said. The behaviour of Lord Laxley in refusing to surrender a young lady
      who declared that her heart was with another, exceeds all I could have
      supposed. One of the noble peers among his ancestors must have been a pig!
      Oh! the Roman nobility! Grace, refinement, intrigue, perfect comprehension
      of your ideas, wishes       the meanest trifles! Here you have every
      worldly charm, and all crowned by Religion! This is my true delight. I
      feel at last that whatsoever I do, I cannot go far wrong while I am within
      hail of my gentle priest. I never could feel so before.
    
    
      'The idea of Mr. Parsley proposing for the beautiful widow Strike! It was
      indecent to do so so soon       widowed under such circumstances! But I
      dare say he was as disinterested as a Protestant curate ever can be.
      Beauty is a good dowry to bring a poor, lean, worldly curate of your
      Church, and he knows that. Your bishops and arches are quite susceptible
      to beautiful petitioners, and we know here how your livings and benefices
      are dispensed. What do you intend to do? Come to me; come to the bosom of
      the old and the only true Church, and I engage to marry you to a Roman
      prince the very next morning or two. That is, if you have no ideas about
      prosecuting a certain enterprise which I should not abandon. In that case,
      stay. As Duchess of B., Mr. Duffian says you would be cordially welcome to
      his Holiness, who may see women. That absurd report is all nonsense. We do
      not kiss his toe, certainly, but we have privileges equally enviable.
      Herbert is all charm. I confess he is a little wearisome with his old
      ruins, and his Dante, the poet. He is quite of my opinion, that Evan will
      never wash out the trade stain on him until he comes over to the Church of
      Rome. I adjure you, Caroline, to lay this clearly before our dear brother.
      In fact, while he continues a Protestant, to me he is a tailor. But here
      Rose is the impediment. I know her to be just one of those little dogged
      minds that are incapable of receiving new impressions. Was it not evident
      in the way she stuck to Evan after I had once brought them together? I am
      not at all astonished that Mr. Raikes should have married her maid. It is
      a case of natural selection. But it is amusing to think of him carrying on
      the old business in 193, and with credit! I suppose his parents are to be
      pitied; but what better is the creature fit for? Mama displeases me in
      consenting to act as housekeeper to old Grumpus. I do not object to the
      fact, for it is prospective; but she should have insisted on another place
      of resort than Fallow field. I do not agree with you in thinking her right
      in refusing a second marriage. Her age does not shelter her from scandal
      in your Protestant communities.
    
    
      'I am every day expecting Harry Jocelyn to turn up.
    
    
      He was rightly sent away, for to think of the folly Evan put into his
      empty head! No; he shall have another wife, and Protestantism shall be his
      forsaken mistress!
    
    
      'See how your Louy has given up the world and its vanities! You expected
      me to creep up to you contrite and whimpering? On the contrary, I never
      felt prouder. And I am not going to live a lazy life, I can assure you.
      The Church hath need of me! If only for the peace it hath given me on one
      point, I am eternally bound to serve it.
    
    
      'Postscript: I am persuaded of this; that it is utterly impossible for a
      man to be a true gentleman who is not of the true Church. What it is I
      cannot say; but it is as a convert that I appreciate my husband. Love is
      made to me, dear, for Catholics are human. The other day it was a question
      whether a lady or a gentleman should be compromised. It required the
      grossest fib. The gentleman did not hesitate. And why? His priest was
      handy. Fancy Lord Laxley in such a case. I shudder. This shows that your
      religion precludes any possibility of the being the real gentleman, and
      whatever Evan may think of himself, or Rose think of him, I KNOW THE
      THING.'

     Love is a contagious disease
     Make no effort to amuse him. He is always occupied
     Man without a penny in his pocket, and a gizzard full of pride
     Married a wealthy manufacturer       bartered her blood for his money
     Maxims of her own on the subject of rising and getting the worm
     Men they regard as their natural prey
     Men do not play truant from home at sixty years of age
     Most youths are like Pope's women; they have no character
     My belief is, you do it on purpose. Can't be such rank idiots
     Never intended that we should play with flesh and blood
     Never to despise the good opinion of the nonentities
     No great harm done when you're silent
     No conversation coming of it, her curiosity was violent
     Notoriously been above the honours of grammar
     Occasional instalments       just to freshen the account
     Oh! I can't bear that class of people
     One fool makes many, and so, no doubt, does one goose
     One seed of a piece of folly will lurk and sprout to confound us
     Our comedies are frequently youth's tragedies
     Partake of a morning draught
     Patronizing woman
     Play second fiddle without looking foolish
     Pride is the God of Pagans
     Propitiate common sense on behalf of what seems tolerably absurd
     Rare as epic song is the man who is thorough in what he does
     Read one another perfectly in their mutual hypocrisies
     Rebukes which give immeasurable rebounds
     Recalling her to the subject-matter with all the patience
     Refuge in the Castle of Negation against the whole army of facts
     Remarked that the young men must fight it out together
     Requiring natural services from her in the button department
     Rose was much behind her age
     Rose! what have I done? 'Nothing at all,' she said
     Said she was what she would have given her hand not to be
     Says you're so clever you ought to be a man
     Second fiddle; he could only mean what she meant
     Secrets throw on the outsiders the onus of raising a scandal
     Sense, even if they can't understand it, flatters them so
     She did not detest the Countess because she could not like her
     She was unworthy to be the wife of a tailor
     She, not disinclined to dilute her grief
     She believed friendship practicable between men and women
     She was at liberty to weep if she pleased
     Sincere as far as she knew: as far as one who loves may be
     Small beginnings, which are in reality the mighty barriers
     Speech is poor where emotion is extreme
     Speech that has to be hauled from the depths usually betrays
     Spiritualism, and on the balm that it was
     Such a man was banned by the world, which was to be despised?
     Taking oath, as it were, by their lower nature
     Tears that dried as soon as they had served their end
     Tenderness which Mrs. Mel permitted rather than encouraged
     That plain confession of a lack of wit; he offered combat
     That beautiful trust which habit gives
     The ass eats at my table, and treats me with contempt
     The Countess dieted the vanity according to the nationality
     The letter had a smack of crabbed age hardly counterfeit
     The commonest things are the worst done
     The thrust sinned in its shrewdness
     The power to give and take flattery to any amount
     The grey furniture of Time for his natural wear
     Those numerous women who always know themselves to be right
     Thus does Love avenge himself on the unsatisfactory Past
     To be both generally blamed, and generally liked
     To let people speak was a maxim of Mrs. Mel's, and a wise one
     Took care to be late, so that all eyes beheld her
     Touching a nerve
     Toyed with little flowers of palest memory
     Tradesman, and he never was known to have sent in a bill
     Tried to be honest, and was as much so as his disease permitted
     True enjoyment of the princely disposition
     Two people love, there is no such thing as owing between them
     Unfeminine of any woman to speak continuously anywhere
     Virtuously zealous in an instant on behalf of the lovely dame
     Vulgarity in others evoked vulgarity in her
     Waited serenely for the certain disasters to enthrone her
     We deprive all renegades of their spiritual titles
     What a stock of axioms young people have handy
     What will be thought of me? not a small matter to any of us
     What he did, she took among other inevitable matters
     What's an eccentric? a child grown grey!
     When testy old gentlemen could commit slaughter with ecstasy
     When you run away, you don't live to fight another day
     When Love is hurt, it is self-love that requires the opiate
     Whose bounty was worse to him than his abuse
     Why, he'll snap your head off for a word
     With good wine to wash it down, one can swallow anything
     With a proud humility
     Wrapped in the comfort of his cowardice
     You do want polish
     You talk your mother with a vengeance
     You accuse or you exonerate       Nobody can be half guilty
     You rides when you can, and you walks when you must
     You're the puppet of your women!
     Youth is not alarmed by the sound of big sums

set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
