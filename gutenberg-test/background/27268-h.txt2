LECTURE I.

DEFINITION OF THE ART OF ENGRAVING.


1. The entrance on my duty for to-day begins the fourth
year of my official work in Oxford; and I doubt not that
some of my audience are asking themselves, very doubtfully&mdash;at
all events, I ask myself, very anxiously&mdash;what has been
done.

For practical result, I have not much to show. I announced,
a fortnight since, that I would meet, the day before
yesterday, any gentleman who wished to attend this course
for purposes of study. My class, so minded, numbers four,
of whom three wish to be artists, and ought not therefore, by
rights, to be at Oxford at all; and the fourth is the last
remaining unit of the class I had last year.

2. Yet I neither in this reproach myself, nor, if I could,
would I reproach the students who are not here. I do not
reproach myself; for it was impossible for me to attend
properly to the schools and to write the grammar for them
at the same time; and I do not blame the absent students
for not attending a school from which I have generally been
absent myself. In all this, there is much to be mended, but,
in true light, nothing to be regretted.

I say, I had to write my school grammar. These three
volumes of lectures under my hand,[A] contain, carefully set
down, the things I want you first to know. None of my
writings are done fluently; the second volume of "Modern[Pg 2]
Painters" was all of it written twice&mdash;most of it, four times,&mdash;over;
and these lectures have been written, I don't know
how many times. You may think that this was done merely
in an author's vanity, not in a tutor's care. To the vanity
I plead guilty,&mdash;no man is more intensely vain than I am;
but my vanity is set on having it known of me that I am
a good master, not in having it said of me that I am a smooth
author. My vanity is never more wounded than in being
called a fine writer, meaning&mdash;that nobody need mind what
I say.

3. Well, then, besides this vanity, I have some solicitude
for your progress. You may give me credit for it or not, as
you choose, but it is sincere. And that your advance may
be safe, I have taken the best pains I could in laying down
laws for it. In these three years I have got my grammar
written, and, with the help of many friends, all working
instruments in good order; and now we will try what we can
do. Not that, even now, you are to depend on my presence
with you in personal teaching. I shall henceforward think
of the lectures less, of the schools more; but my best work for
the schools will often be by drawing in Florence or in Lancashire&mdash;not
here.

4. I have already told you several times that the course
through which I mean every student in these schools should
pass, is one which shall enable them to understand the
elementary principles of the finest art. It will necessarily
be severe, and seem to lead to no immediate result. Some of
you will, on the contrary, wish to be taught what is immediately
easy, and gives prospect of a manifest success.

But suppose they should come to the Professor of Logic
and Rhetoric, and tell him they want to be taught to preach
like Mr. Spurgeon, or the Bishop of &mdash;&mdash;.

He would say to them,&mdash;I cannot, and if I could I would
not, tell you how to preach like Mr. Spurgeon, or the Bishop
of &mdash;&mdash;. Your own character will form your style; your
own zeal will direct it; your own obstinacy or ignorance may
limit or exaggerate it; but my business is to prevent, as far[Pg 3]
as I can, your having any particular style; and to teach you
the laws of all language, and the essential power of your own.

In like manner, this course, which I propose to you in art,
will be calculated only to give you judgment and method in
future study, to establish to your conviction the laws of
general art, and to enable you to draw, if not with genius, at
least with sense and propriety.

The course, so far as it consists in practice, will be defined
in my Instructions for the schools. And the theory connected
with that practice is set down in the three lectures at the end
of the first course I delivered&mdash;those on Line, Light, and
Color.

You will have, therefore, to get this book,[B] and it is the
only one which you will need to have of your own,&mdash;the
others are placed, for reference, where they will be accessible
to you.

5. In the 139th paragraph it states the order of your practical
study in these terms:&mdash;

"I wish you to begin by getting command of line;&mdash;that
is to say, by learning to draw a steady line, limiting with
absolute correctness the form or space you intend it to limit;
to proceed by getting command over flat tints, so that you may
be able to fill the spaces you have inclosed evenly, either with
shade or color, according to the school you adopt; and, finally,
to obtain the power of adding such fineness of drawing, within
the masses, as shall express their undulation, and their characters
of form and texture."

And now, since in your course of practice you are first
required to attain the power of drawing lines accurately and
delicately, so in the course of theory, or grammar, I wish you
first to learn the principles of linear design, exemplified by
the schools which (&sect; 137) you will find characterized as the
Schools of Line.

6. If I had command of as much time as I should like to
spend with you on this subject, I would begin with the early[Pg 4]
forms of art which used the simplest linear elements of design.
But, for general service and interest, it will be better that I
should sketch what has been accomplished by the greatest
masters in that manner; the rather that their work is more
or less accessible to all, and has developed into the vast industries
of modern engraving, one of the most powerful existing
influences of education and sources of pleasure among civilized
people.

And this investigation, so far from interrupting, will
facilitate our examination of the history of the nobler arts.
You will see in the preface to my lectures on Greek sculpture
that I intend them to be followed by a course on architecture,
and that by one on Florentine sculpture. But the art of
engraving is so manifestly, at Florence, though not less
essentially elsewhere, a basis of style both in architecture and
sculpture, that it is absolutely necessary I should explain to
you in what the skill of the engraver consists, before I can
define with accuracy that of more admired artists. For
engraving, though not altogether in the method of which you
see examples in the print-shops of the High Street, is, indeed,
a prior art to that either of building or sculpture, and is an
inseparable part of both, when they are rightly practiced.

7. And while we thus examine the scope of this first of
the arts, it will be necessary that we learn also the scope of
mind of the early practicers of it, and accordingly acquaint
ourselves with the main events in the biography of the schools
of Florence. To understand the temper and meaning of one
great master is to lay the best, if not the only, foundation for
the understanding of all; and I shall therefore make it the
leading aim of this course of lectures to remind you of what
is known, and direct you to what is knowable, of the life and
character of the greatest Florentine master of engraving,
Sandro Botticelli; and, incidentally, to give you some idea
of the power of the greatest master of the German, or any
northern, school, Hans Holbein.

8. You must feel, however, that I am using the word
"engraving" in a somewhat different, and, you may imagine,[Pg 5]
a wider, sense, than that which you are accustomed to attach
to it. So far from being a wider sense, it is in reality a more
accurate and restricted one, while yet it embraces every conceivable
right application of the art. And I wish, in this
first lecture, to make entirely clear to you the proper meaning
of the word, and proper range of the art of, engraving; in
my next following lecture, to show you its place in Italian
schools, and then, in due order, the place it ought to take in
our own, and in all schools.

9. First then, to-day, of the Differentia, or essential quality
of Engraving, as distinguished from other arts.

What answer would you make to me, if I asked casually
what engraving was? Perhaps the readiest which would
occur to you would be, "The translation of pictures into black
and white by means admitting reduplication of impressions."
But if that be done by lithography, we do not call it engraving,&mdash;whereas
we speak contentedly and continually of seal
engraving, in which there is no question of black and white.
And, as scholars, you know that this customary mode of
speaking is quite accurate; and that engraving means, primarily,
making a permanent cut or furrow in something.
The central syllable of the word has become a sorrowful one,
meaning the most permanent of furrows.

10. But are you prepared absolutely to accept this limitation
with respect to engraving as a pictorial art? Will you
call nothing an engraving, except a group of furrows or cavities
cut in a hard substance? What shall we say of mezzotint
engraving, for instance, in which, though indeed furrows and
cavities are produced mechanically as a ground, the artist's
work is in effacing them? And when we consider the power
of engraving in representing pictures and multiplying them,
are we to recognize and admire no effects of light and shade
except those which are visibly produced by dots or furrows?
I mean, will the virtue of an engraving be in exhibiting these
imperfect means of its effect, or in concealing them?

11. Here, for instance, is the head of a soldier by D&uuml;rer,&mdash;a
mere gridiron of black lines. Would this be better or worse[Pg 6]
engraving if it were more like a photograph or lithograph,
and no lines seen?&mdash;suppose, more like the head of Mr. Santley,
now in all the music-shops, and really quite deceptive in
light and shade, when seen from over the way? Do you think
D&uuml;rer's work would be better if it were more like that? And
would you have me, therefore, leaving the question of technical
method of production altogether to the craftsman, consider
pictorial engraving simply as the production of a light-and-shade
drawing, by some method permitting its multiplication
for the public?

12. This, you observe, is a very practical question indeed.
For instance, the illustrations of my own lectures on sculpture
are equivalent to permanent photographs. There can
be little doubt that means will be discovered of thus producing
perfect facsimiles of artists' drawings; so that, if no more
than facsimile be required, the old art of cutting furrows in
metal may be considered as, at this day, virtually ended.
And, indeed, it is said that line engravers cannot any more
get apprentices, and that a pure steel or copper plate is not
likely to be again produced, when once the old living masters
of the bright field shall have been all laid in their earth-furrows.

13. Suppose, then, that this come to pass; and more than
this, suppose that wood engraving also be superseded, and
that instead of imperfect transcripts of drawings, on wood-blocks
or metal-plates, photography enabled us to give, quite
cheaply, and without limit to number, facsimiles of the finished
light-and-shade drawings of artists themselves. Another
group of questions instantly offers itself, on these new conditions;
namely, What are the best means for a light-and-shade
drawing&mdash;the pen, or the pencil, the charcoal, or the
flat wash? That is to say, the pen, producing shade by black
lines, as old engraving did; the pencil, producing shade by
gray lines, variable in force; the charcoal, producing a
smoky shadow with no lines in it, or the washed tint, producing
a transparent shadow with no lines in it. Which of these[Pg 7]
methods is the best?&mdash;or have they, each and all, virtues to
be separately studied, and distinctively applied?

14. See how curiously the questions multiply on us. 1st,
Is engraving to be only considered as cut work? 2d, For
present designs multipliable without cutting, by the sunshine,
what methods or instruments of drawing will be best? And
now, 3dly, before we can discuss these questions at all, is
there not another lying at the root of both,&mdash;namely, what
a light-and-shade drawing itself properly is, and how it
differs, or should differ, from a painting, whether by mere
deficiency, or by some entirely distinct merit?

15. For instance, you know how confidently it is said, in
common talk about Turner, that his works are intelligible
and beautiful when engraved, though incomprehensible as
paintings. Admitting this to be so, do you suppose it is
because the translation into light and shade is deficient in
some qualities which the painting had, or that it possesses
some quality which the painting had not? Does it please
more because it is deficient in the color which confused a
feeble spectator, and offended a dogmatic one,&mdash;or because it
possesses a decision in its steady linear labor which interprets,
or corrects, the swift penciling of the artist?

16. Do you notice the two words I have just used, Decision,
and Linear?&mdash;Decision, again introducing the idea of cuts
or divisions, as opposed to gradations; Linear, as opposed to
massive or broad?

Yet we use all these words at different times in praise,
while they evidently mark inconsistent qualities. Softness
and decision, breadth and delineation, cannot co-exist in
equal degrees. There must surely therefore be a virtue in
the engraving inconsistent with that of the painting, and
vice vers&acirc;.

Now, be clear about these three questions which we have
to-day to answer.

A. Is all engraving to be cut work?

B. If it need not be cut work, but only the reproduction
of a drawing, what methods of executing a light-and-shade
drawing will be best?[Pg 8]

C. Is the shaded drawing itself to be considered only as
a deficient or imperfect painting, or as a different
thing from a painting, having a virtue of its own,
belonging to black and white, as opposed to color?

17. I will give you the answers at once, briefly, and amplify
them afterwards.

A. All engraving must be cut work;&mdash;that is its differentia.
Unless your effect be produced by cutting into some
solid substance, it is not engraving at all.

B. The proper methods for light-and-shade drawing vary
according to subject, and the degree of completeness
desired,&mdash;some of them having much in common with
engraving, and others with painting.

C. The qualities of a light-and-shade drawing ought to
be entirely different from those of a painting. It is
not a deficient or partial representation of a colored
scene or picture, but an entirely different reading of
either. So that much of what is intelligible in a
painting ought to be unintelligible in a light-and-shade
study, and vice vers&acirc;.

You have thus three arts,&mdash;engraving, light-and-shade
drawing, and painting.

Now I am not going to lecture, in this course, on painting,
nor on light-and-shade drawing, but on engraving only. But
I must tell you something about light-and-shade drawing
first; or, at least, remind you of what I have before told.

18. You see that the three elementary lectures in my first
volume are on Line, Light, and Color,&mdash;that is to say, on
the modes of art which produce linear designs,&mdash;which produce
effects of light,&mdash;and which produce effects of color.

I must, for the sake of new students, briefly repeat the
explanation of these.

Here is an Arabian vase, in which the pleasure given to
the eye is only by lines;&mdash;no effect of light, or of color, is
attempted. Here is a moonlight by Turner, in which there
are no lines at all, and no colors at all. The pleasure given
to the eye is only by modes of light and shade, or effects of[Pg 9]
light. Finally, here is an early Florentine painting, in
which there are no lines of importance, and no effect of light
whatever; but all the pleasure given to the eye is in gayety
and variety of color.

19. I say, the pleasure given to the eye. The lines on
this vase write something; but the ornamentation produced
by the beautiful writing is independent of its meaning. So
the moonlight is pleasant, first, as light; and the figures,
first, as color. It is not the shape of the waves, but the light
on them; not the expression of the figures, but their color, by
which the ocular pleasure is to be given.

These three examples are violently marked ones; but, in
preparing to draw any object, you will find that, practically,
you have to ask yourself, Shall I aim at the color of it, the
light of it, or the lines of it? You can't have all three; you
can't even have any two out of the three in equal strength.
The best art, indeed, comes so near nature as in a measure to
unite all. But the best is not, and cannot be, as good as
nature; and the mode of its deficiency is that it must lose
some of the color, some of the light, or some of the delineation.
And in consequence, there is one great school which
says, We will have the color, and as much light and delineation
as are consistent with it. Another which says, We will
have shade, and as much color and delineation as are consistent
with it. The third, We will have delineation, and
as much color and shade as are consistent with it.

20. And though much of the two subordinate qualities may
in each school be consistent with the leading one, yet the
schools are evermore separate: as, for instance, in other matters,
one man says, I will have my fee, and as much honesty
as is consistent with it; another, I will have my honesty,
and as much fee as is consistent with it. Though the man
who will have his fee be subordinately honest,&mdash;though the
man who will have his honor, subordinately rich, are they
not evermore of diverse schools?

So you have, in art, the utterly separate provinces, though
in contact at their borders, of[Pg 10]

The Delineators;
The Chiaroscurists; and
The Colorists.

21. The Delineators are the men on whom I am going
to give you this course of lectures. They are essentially
engravers, an engraved line being the best means of delineation.
The Chiaroscurists are essentially draughtsmen with
chalk, charcoal, or single tints. Many of them paint, but
always with some effort and pain. Lionardo is the type of
them; but the entire Dutch school consists of them, laboriously
painting, without essential genius for color.

The Colorists are the true painters; and all the faultless
(as far, that is to say, as men's work can be so,) and consummate
masters of art belong to them.

22. The distinction between the colorist and chiaroscurist
school is trenchant and absolute: and may soon be shown you
so that you will never forget it. Here is a Florentine picture
by one of the pupils of Giotto, of very good representative
quality, and which the University galleries are rich in possessing.
At the distance at which I hold it, you see nothing but
a checker-work of brilliant, and, as it happens, even glaring
colors. If you come near, you will find this patchwork
resolve itself into a Visitation, and Birth of St. John; but
that St. Elizabeth's red dress, and the Virgin's blue and
white one, and the brown posts of the door, and the blue
spaces of the sky, are painted in their own entirely pure
colors, each shaded with more powerful tints of itself,&mdash;pale
blue with deep blue, scarlet with crimson, yellow with orange,
and green with richer green.

The whole is therefore as much a mosaic work of brilliant
color as if it were made of bits of glass. There is no effect
of light attempted, or so much as thought of: you don't know
even where the sun is: nor have you the least notion what
time of day it is. The painter thinks you cannot be so superfluous
as to want to know what time of day it is.

23. Here, on the other hand, is a Dutch picture of good
average quality, also out of the University galleries. It[Pg 11]
represents a group of cattle, and a herdsman watching them.
And you see in an instant that the time is evening. The sun
is setting, and there is warm light on the landscape, the
cattle, and the standing figure.

Nor does the picture in any conspicuous way seem devoid
of color. On the contrary, the herdsman has a scarlet jacket,
which comes out rather brilliantly from the mass of shade
round it; and a person devoid of color faculty, or ill taught,
might imagine the picture to be really a fine work of color.

But if you will come up close to it, you will find that the
herdsman has brown sleeves, though he has a scarlet jacket;
and that the shadows of both are painted with precisely the
same brown, and in several places with continuous touches
of the pencil. It is only in the light that the scarlet is
laid on.

This at once marks the picture as belonging to the lower
or chiaroscurist school, even if you had not before recognized
it as such by its pretty rendering of sunset effect.

24. You might at first think it a painting which showed
greater skill than that of the school of Giotto. But the skill
is not the primary question. The power of imagination is
the first thing to be asked about. This Italian work imagines,
and requires you to imagine also, a St. Elizabeth and St.
Mary, to the best of your power. But this Dutch one only
wishes you to imagine an effect of sunlight on cow-skin,
which is a far lower strain of the imaginative faculty.

Also, as you may see the effect of sunlight on cow-skin,
in reality, any summer afternoon, but cannot so frequently
see a St. Elizabeth, it is a far less useful strain of the imaginative
faculty.

And, generally speaking, the Dutch chiaroscurists are
indeed persons without imagination at all,&mdash;who, not being
able to get any pleasure out of their thoughts, try to get it
out of their sensations; note, however, also their technical
connection with the Greek school of shade, (see my sixth
inaugural lecture, &sect; 158,) in which color was refused, not
for the sake of deception, but of solemnity.[Pg 12]

25. With these final motives you are not now concerned;
your present business is the quite easy one of knowing, and
noticing, the universal distinction between the methods of
treatment in which the aim is light, and in which it is color;
and so to keep yourselves guarded from the danger of being
misled by the, often very ingenious, talk of persons who have
vivid color sensations without having learned to distinguish
them from what else pleases them in pictures. There is
an interesting volume by Professor Taine on the Dutch
school, containing a valuable historical analysis of the influences
which formed it; but full of the gravest errors, resulting
from the confusion in his mind between color and tone,
in consequence of which he imagines the Dutch painters to
be colorists.

26. It is so important for you to be grounded securely in
these first elements of pictorial treatment, that I will be so
far tedious as to show you one more instance of the relative
intellectual value of the pure color and pure chiaroscuro
school, not in Dutch and Florentine, but in English art.
Here is a copy of one of the lost frescoes of our Painted
Chamber of Westminster;&mdash;fourteenth-century work, entirely
conceived in color, and calculated for decorative effect.
There is no more light and shade in it than in a Queen of
Hearts in a pack of cards;&mdash;all that the painter at first wants
you to see is that the young lady has a white forehead, and
a golden crown, and a fair neck, and a violet robe, and a
crimson shield with golden leopards on it; and that behind
her is clear blue sky. Then, farther, he wants you to read
her name, "Debonnairete," which, when you have read,
he farther expects you to consider what it is to be debonnaire,
and to remember your Chaucer's description of the virtue:&mdash;


She was not brown, nor dun of hue,
But white as snowe, fallen new,
With eyen glad, and browes bent,
Her hair down to her heeles went,
And she was simple, as dove on tree,
Full debonnair of heart was she.
[Pg 13]

27. You see Chaucer dwells on the color just as much as
the painter does, but the painter has also given her the
English shield to bear, meaning that good-humor, or debonnairete,
cannot be maintained by self-indulgence;&mdash;only by
fortitude. Farther note, with Chaucer, the "eyen glad," and
brows "bent" (high-arched and calm), the strong life, (hair
down to the heels,) and that her gladness is to be without
subtlety,&mdash;that is to say, without the slightest pleasure in any
form of advantage-taking, or any shrewd or mocking wit:
"she was simple as dove on tree;" and you will find that
the color-painting, both in the fresco and in the poem, is in
the very highest degree didactic and intellectual; and distinguished,
as being so, from all inferior forms of art.
Farther, that it requires you yourself first to understand the
nature of simplicity, and to like simplicity in young ladies
better than subtlety; and to understand why the second of
Love's five kind arrows (Beaut&eacute; being the first)&mdash;


Simplece ot nom, la seconde
Qui maint homme parmi le monde
Et mainte dame fait amer.


Nor must you leave the picture without observing that there
is another reason for Debonnairete's bearing the Royal shield,&mdash;of
all shields that, rather than another. "De-bonne-aire"
meant originally "out of a good eagle's nest," the "aire"
signifying the eagle's nest or eyrie especially, because it is
flat, the Latin "area" being the root of all.

And this coming out of a good nest is recognized as, of all
things, needfulest to give the strength which enables people
to be good-humored; and thus you have "debonnaire" forming
the third word of the group, with "gentle" and "kind,"
all first signifying "of good race."

You will gradually see, as we go on, more and more why
I called my third volume of lectures Eagle's Nest; for I am
not fantastic in these titles, as is often said; but try shortly
to mark my chief purpose in the book by them.

28. Now for comparison with this old art, here is a[Pg 14]
modern engraving, in which color is entirely ignored; and
light and shade alone are used to produce what is supposed
to be a piece of impressive religious instruction. But it is
not a piece of religious instruction at all;&mdash;only a piece of
religious sensation, prepared for the sentimental pleasure of
young ladies; whom (since I am honored to-day by the
presence of many) I will take the opportunity of warning
against such forms of false theological satisfaction. This
engraving represents a young lady in a very long and, though
plain, very becoming white dress, tossed upon the waves of
a terrifically stormy sea, by which neither her hair nor her
becoming dress is in the least wetted; and saved from despair
in that situation by closely embracing a very thick and solid
stone Cross. By which far-sought and original metaphor
young ladies are expected, after some effort, to understand the
recourse they may have, for support, to the Cross of Christ,
in the midst of the troubles of this world.

29. As those troubles are for the present, in all probability,
limited to the occasional loss of their thimbles when they
have not taken care to put them into their work-boxes,&mdash;the
concern they feel at the unsympathizing gayety of their companions,&mdash;or
perhaps the disappointment at not hearing a
favorite clergyman preach,&mdash;(for I will not suppose the
young ladies interested in this picture to be affected by any
chagrin at the loss of an invitation to a ball, or the like worldliness,)&mdash;it
seems to me the stress of such calamities might
be represented, in a picture, by less appalling imagery. And
I can assure my fair little lady friends,&mdash;if I still have any,&mdash;that
whatever a young girl's ordinary troubles or annoyances
may be, her true virtue is in shaking them off, as a rose-leaf
shakes off rain, and remaining debonnaire and bright in
spirits, or even, as the rose would be, the brighter for the
troubles; and not at all in allowing herself to be either drifted
or depressed to the point of requiring religious consolation.
But if any real and deep sorrow, such as no metaphor can
represent, fall upon her, does she suppose that the theological
advice of this piece of modern art can be trusted? If she[Pg 15]
will take the pains to think truly, she will remember that
Christ Himself never says anything about holding by His
Cross. He speaks a good deal of bearing it; but never for
an instant of holding by it. It is His Hand, not His Cross,
which is to save either you, or St. Peter, when the waves are
rough. And the utterly reckless way in which modern religious
teachers, whether in art or literature, abuse the metaphor
somewhat briefly and violently leant on by St. Paul, simply
prevents your understanding the meaning of any word which
Christ Himself speaks on this matter! So you see this popular
art of light and shade, catching you by your mere thirst
of sensation, is not only undidactic, but the reverse of didactic&mdash;deceptive
and illusory.

30. This popular art, you hear me say, scornfully; and I
have told you, in some of my teaching in "Aratra Pentelici,"
that all great art must be popular. Yes, but great art is
popular, as bread and water are to children fed by a father.
And vile art is popular, as poisonous jelly is, to children
cheated by a confectioner. And it is quite possible to make
any kind of art popular on those last terms. The color school
may become just as poisonous as the colorless, in the hands
of fools, or of rogues. Here is a book I bought only the other
day,&mdash;one of the things got up cheap to catch the eyes of
mothers at bookstalls,&mdash;Puss in Boots, illustrated; a most
definite work of the color school&mdash;red jackets and white paws
and yellow coaches as distinct as Giotto or Raphael would
have kept them. But the thing is done by fools for money,
and becomes entirely monstrous and abominable. Here,
again, is color art produced by fools for religion: here is
Indian sacred painting,&mdash;a black god with a hundred arms,
with a green god on one side of him and a red god on the
other; still a most definite work of the color school. Giotto
or Raphael could not have made the black more resolutely
black, (though the whole color of the school of Athens is
kept in distinct separation from one black square in it), nor
the green more unquestionably green. Yet the whole is
pestilent and loathsome.[Pg 16]

31. Now but one point more, and I have done with this
subject for to-day.

You must not think that this manifest brilliancy and
Harlequin's-jacket character is essential in the color school.
The essential matter is only that everything should be of
its own definite color: it may be altogether sober and dark,
yet the distinctness of hue preserved with entire fidelity.
Here, for instance, is a picture of Hogarth's,&mdash;one of quite
the most precious things we have in our galleries. It represents
a meeting of some learned society&mdash;gentlemen of the
last century, very gravely dressed, but who, nevertheless, as
gentlemen pleasantly did in that day,&mdash;you remember Goldsmith's
weakness on the point&mdash;wear coats of tints of dark
red, blue, or violet. There are some thirty gentlemen in the
room, and perhaps seven or eight different tints of subdued
claret-color in their coats; and yet every coat is kept so
distinctly of its own proper claret-color, that each gentleman's
servant would know his master's.

Yet the whole canvas is so gray and quiet, that as I now
hold it by this Dutch landscape, with the vermilion jacket,
you would fancy Hogarth's had no color in it at all, and that
the Dutchman was half-way to becoming a Titian; whereas
Hogarth's is a consummate piece of the most perfect colorist
school, which Titian could not beat, in its way; and the
Dutchman could no more paint half an inch of it than he
could summon a rainbow into the clouds.

32. Here then, you see, are, altogether, five works, all of
the absolutely pure color school:&mdash;


One, Indian,&mdash;Religious Art;
One, Florentine,&mdash;Religious Art;
One, English,&mdash;from Painted Chamber, Westminster,&mdash;Ethic Art;
One, English,&mdash;Hogarth,&mdash;Naturalistic Art;
One, English,&mdash;to-day sold in the High Street,&mdash;Caricaturist Art.


And of these, the Florentine and old English are divine[Pg 17]
work, God-inspired; full, indeed, of faults and innocencies,
but divine, as good children are.

Then this by Hogarth is entirely wise and right; but
worldly-wise, not divine.

While the old Indian, and this, with which we feed our
children at this hour, are entirely damnable art;&mdash;every bit
of it done by the direct inspiration of the devil,&mdash;feeble,
ridiculous,&mdash;yet mortally poisonous to every noble quality
in body and soul.

33. I have now, I hope, guarded you sufficiently from the
danger either of confusing the inferior school of chiaroscuro
with that of color, or of imagining that a work must necessarily
be good, on the sole ground of its belonging to the
higher group. I can now proceed securely to separate the
third school, that of Delineation, from both; and to examine
its special qualities.

It begins (see "Inaugural Lectures," &sect; 137) in the primitive
work of races insensible alike to shade and to color, and
nearly devoid of thought and of sentiment, but gradually
developing into both.

Now as the design is primitive, so are the means likely to
be primitive. A line is the simplest work of art you can
produce. What are the simplest means you can produce it
with?

A Cumberland lead-pencil is a work of art in itself, quite
a nineteenth-century machine. Pen and ink are complex and
scholarly; and even chalk or charcoal not always handy.

But the primitive line, the first and last, generally the best
of lines, is that which you have elementary faculty of at your
fingers' ends, and which kittens can draw as well as you&mdash;the
scratch.

The first, I say, and the last of lines. Permanent exceedingly,&mdash;even
in flesh, or on mahogany tables, often more
permanent than we desire. But when studiously and honorably
made, divinely permanent, or delightfully&mdash;as on the
venerable desks of our public schools, most of them, now,
specimens of wood engraving dear to the heart of England.[Pg 18]

34. Engraving, then, is, in brief terms, the Art of Scratch.
It is essentially the cutting into a solid substance for the sake
of making your ideas as permanent as possible, graven with
an iron pen in the Rock forever. Permanence, you observe,
is the object, not multiplicability;&mdash;that is quite an accidental,
sometimes not even a desirable, attribute of engraving.
Duration of your work&mdash;fame, and undeceived vision
of all men, on the pane of glass of the window on a wet
day, or on the pillars of the castle of Chillon, or on the
walls of the pyramids;&mdash;a primitive art,&mdash;yet first and last
with us.

Since then engraving, we say, is essentially cutting into
the surface of any solid; as the primitive design is in lines
or dots, the primitive cutting of such design is a scratch or a
hole; and scratchable solids being essentially three&mdash;stone,
wood, metal,&mdash;we shall have three great schools of engraving
to investigate in each material.

35. On tablet of stone, on tablet of wood, on tablet of steel,&mdash;the
first giving the law to everything; the second true
Athenian, like Athena's first statue in olive-wood, making
the law legible and homely; and the third true Vulcanian,
having the splendor and power of accomplished labor.

Now of stone engraving, which is joined inseparably with
sculpture and architecture, I am not going to speak at length
in this course of lectures. I shall speak only of wood and
metal engraving. But there is one circumstance in stone
engraving which it is necessary to observe in connection with
the other two branches of the art.

The great difficulty for a primitive engraver is to make his
scratch deep enough to be visible. Visibility is quite as
essential to your fame as permanence; and if you have only
your furrow to depend on, the engraved tablet, at certain
times of day, will be illegible, and passed without notice.

But suppose you fill in your furrow with something black,
then it will be legible enough at once; and if the black fall
out or wash out, still your furrow is there, and may be filled
again by anybody.[Pg 19]

Therefore, the noble stone engravers, using marble to
receive their furrow, fill that furrow with marble ink.

And you have an engraved plate to purpose;&mdash;with the
whole sky for its margin! Look here&mdash;the front of the church
of San Michele of Lucca,&mdash;white marble with green serpentine
for ink; or here,&mdash;the steps of the Giant's Stair, with
lead for ink; or here,&mdash;the floor of the Pisan Duomo, with
porphyry for ink. Such cutting, filled in with color or with
black, branches into all sorts of developments,&mdash;Florentine
mosaic on the one hand, niello on the other, and infinite minor
arts.

36. Yet we must not make this filling with color part of
our definition of engraving. To engrave is, in final strictness,
"to decorate a surface with furrows." (Cameos, in
accuratest terms, are minute sculptures, not engravings.)
A plowed field is the purest type of such art; and is, on
hilly land, an exquisite piece of decoration.

Therefore it will follow that engraving distinguishes itself
from ordinary drawing by greater need of muscular effort.

The quality of a pen drawing is to be produced easily,&mdash;deliberately,
always,[C] but with a point that glides over the
paper. Engraving, on the contrary, requires always force,
and its virtue is that of a line produced by pressure, or by
blows of a chisel.

It involves, therefore, always, ideas of power and dexterity,
but also of restraint; and the delight you take in it should
involve the understanding of the difficulty the workman dealt
with. You perhaps doubt the extent to which this feeling
justly extends, (in the first volume of "Modern Painters,"
expressed under the head "Ideas of Power.") But why is
a large stone in any building grander than a small one?
Simply because it was more difficult to raise it. So, also, an
engraved line is, and ought to be, recognized as more grand
than a pen or pencil line, because it was more difficult to
execute it.

In this mosaic of Lucca front you forgive much, and admire[Pg 20]
much, because you see it is all cut in stone. So, in wood and
steel, you ought to see that every line has been costly; but
observe, costly of deliberative, no less than athletic or executive
power. The main use of the restraint which makes
the line difficult to draw, is to give time and motive for
deliberation in drawing it, and to insure its being the best in
your power.

37. For, as with deliberation, so without repentance, your
engraved line must be. It may, indeed, be burnished or
beaten out again in metal, or patched and botched in stone;
but always to disadvantage, and at pains which must not be
incurred often. And there is a singular evidence in one of
D&uuml;rer's finest plates that, in his time, or at least in his
manner of work, it was not possible at all. Among the disputes
as to the meaning of D&uuml;rer's Knight and Death, you
will find it sometimes suggested, or insisted, that the horse's
raised foot is going to fall into a snare. What has been
fancied a noose is only the former outline of the horse's foot
and limb, uneffaced.

The engraved line is therefore to be conclusive; not experimental.
"I have determined this," says the engraver. Much
excellent pen drawing is excellent in being tentative,&mdash;in being
experimental. Indeterminate, not through want of meaning,
but through fullness of it&mdash;halting wisely between two
opinions&mdash;feeling cautiously after clearer opinions. But
your engraver has made up his opinion. This is so, and
must forever be so, he tells you. A very proper thing for a
thoughtful man to say; a very improper and impertinent
thing for a foolish one to say. Foolish engraving is consummately
foolish work. Look,&mdash;all the world,&mdash;look for
evermore, says the foolish engraver; see what a fool I have
been! How many lines I have laid for nothing! How many
lines upon lines, with no precept, much less superprecept!

38. Here, then, are two definite ethical characters in all
engraved work. It is Athletic; and it is Resolute. Add one
more; that it is Obedient;&mdash;in their infancy the nurse, but
in their youth the slave, of the higher arts; servile, both in[Pg 21]
the mechanism and labor of it, and in its function of interpreting
the schools of painting as superior to itself.

And this relation to the higher arts we will study at the
source of chief power in all the normal skill of Christendom,
Florence; and chiefly, as I said, in the work of one Florentine
master, Sandro Botticelli.

LECTURE II.

THE RELATION OF ENGRAVING TO OTHER ARTS IN FLORENCE.


39. From what was laid before you in my last lecture, you
must now be aware that I do not mean, by the word 'engraving,'
merely the separate art of producing plates from which
black pictures may be printed.

I mean, by engraving, the art of producing decoration on
a surface by the touches of a chisel or a burin; and I mean
by its relation to other arts, the subordinate service of this
linear work, in sculpture, in metal work, and in painting; or
in the representation and repetition of painting.

And first, therefore, I have to map out the broad relations
of the arts of sculpture, metal work, and painting, in Florence,
among themselves, during the period in which the art of
engraving was distinctly connected with them.[D]

40. You will find, or may remember, that in my lecture
on Michael Angelo and Tintoret I indicated the singular
importance, in the history of art, of a space of forty years,
between 1480, and the year in which Raphael died, 1520.
Within that space of time the change was completed, from
the principles of ancient, to those of existing, art;&mdash;a manifold
change, not definable in brief terms, but most clearly
characterized, and easily remembered, as the change of conscientious
and didactic art, into that which proposes to itself
no duty beyond technical skill, and no object but the pleasure
of the beholder. Of that momentous change itself I do not
purpose to speak in the present course of lectures; but my
endeavor will be to lay before you a rough chart of the[Pg 23]
course of the arts in Florence up to the time when it took
place; a chart indicating for you, definitely, the growth of
conscience, in work which is distinctively conscientious, and
the perfecting of expression and means of popular address,
in that which is distinctively didactic.

41. Means of popular address, observe, which have become
singularly important to us at this day. Nevertheless, remember
that the power of printing, or reprinting, black pictures,&mdash;practically
contemporary with that of reprinting black
letters,&mdash;modified the art of the draughtsman only as it modified
that of the scribe. Beautiful and unique writing, as
beautiful and unique painting or engraving, remain exactly
what they were; but other useful and reproductive methods
of both have been superadded. Of these, it is acutely said
by Dr. Alfred Woltmann,[E]&mdash;

"A far more important part is played in the art-life of Germany by
the technical arts for the multiplying of works; for Germany, while it
was the land of book-printing, is also the land of picture-printing.
Indeed, wood-engraving, which preceded the invention of book-printing,
prepared the way for it, and only left one step more necessary for
it. Book-printing and picture-printing have both the same inner cause
for their origin, namely, the impulse to make each mental gain a common
blessing. Not merely princes and rich nobles were to have the
privilege of adorning their private chapels and apartments with
beautiful religious pictures; the poorest man was also to have his
delight in that which the artist had devised and produced. It was not
sufficient for him when it stood in the church as an altar-shrine, visible
to him and to the congregation from afar; he desired to have it as his
own, to carry it about with him, to bring it into his own home. The
grand importance of wood-engraving and copperplate is not sufficiently
estimated in historical investigations. They were not alone of use in
the advance of art; they form an epoch in the entire life of mind and
culture. The idea embodied and multiplied in pictures became like
that embodied in the printed word, the herald of every intellectual
movement, and conquered the world."

42. "Conquered the world"? The rest of the sentence
is true, but this, hyperbolic, and greatly false. It should[Pg 24]
have been said that both painting and engraving have conquered
much of the good in the world, and, hitherto, little
or none of the evil.

Nor do I hold it usually an advantage to art, in teaching,
that it should be common, or constantly seen. In becoming
intelligibly and kindly beautiful, while it remains solitary
and unrivaled, it has a greater power. Westminster Abbey
is more didactic to the English nation, than a million of
popular illustrated treatises on architecture.

Nay, even that it cannot be understood but with some
difficulty, and must be sought before it can be seen, is no
harm. The noblest didactic art is, as it were, set on a hill,
and its disciples come to it. The vilest destructive and
corrosive art stands at the street corners, crying, "Turn in
hither; come, eat of my bread, and drink of my wine, which
I have mingled."

And Dr. Woltmann has allowed himself too easily to fall
into the common notion of Liberalism, that bad art, disseminated,
is instructive, and good art isolated, not so. The
question is, first, I assure you, whether what art you have got
is good or bad. If essentially bad, the more you see of it, the
worse for you. Entirely popular art is all that is noble, in
the cathedral, the council chamber, and the market-place; not
the paltry colored print pinned on the wall of a private room.

43. I despise the poor!&mdash;do I, think you? Not so. They
only despise the poor who think them better off with police
news, and colored tracts of the story of Joseph and Potiphar's
wife, than they were with Luini painting on their church
walls, and Donatello carving the pillars of their market-places.

Nevertheless, the effort to be universally, instead of locally,
didactic, modified advantageously, as you know, and in a
thousand ways varied, the earlier art of engraving: and the
development of its popular power, whether for good or evil,
came exactly&mdash;so fate appointed&mdash;at a time when the minds
of the masses were agitated by the struggle which closed in
the Reformation in some countries, and in the desperate[Pg 25]
refusal of Reformation in others.[F] The two greatest masters
of engraving whose lives we are to study, were, both of them,
passionate reformers: Holbein no less than Luther; Botticelli
no less than Savonarola.

44. Reformers, I mean, in the full and, accurately, the
only, sense. Not preachers of new doctrines; but witnesses
against the betrayal of the old ones, which were on the lips
of all men, and in the lives of none. Nay, the painters are
indeed more pure reformers than the priests. They rebuked
the manifest vices of men, while they realized whatever was
loveliest in their faith. Priestly reform soon enraged itself
into mere contest for personal opinions; while, without rage,
but in stern rebuke of all that was vile in conduct or thought,&mdash;in
declaration of the always-received faiths of the Christian
Church, and in warning of the power of faith, and death,[G]
over the petty designs of men,&mdash;Botticelli and Holbein together
fought foremost in the ranks of the Reformation.

45. To-day I will endeavor to explain how they attained
such rank. Then, in the next two lectures, the technics of
both,&mdash;their way of speaking; and in the last two, what they
had got to say.

First, then, we ask how they attained this rank;&mdash;who
taught them what they were finally best to teach? How far
must every people&mdash;how far did this Florentine people&mdash;teach
its masters, before they could teach it?

Even in these days, when every man is, by hypothesis, as
good as another, does not the question sound strange to you?
You recognize in the past, as you think, clearly, that national
advance takes place always under the guidance of masters, or
groups of masters, possessed of what appears to be some new
personal sensibility or gift of invention; and we are apt to[Pg 26]
be reverent to these alone, as if the nation itself had been
unprogressive, and suddenly awakened, or converted, by the
genius of one man.

No idea can be more superficial. Every nation must teach
its tutors, and prepare itself to receive them; but the fact on
which our impression is founded&mdash;the rising, apparently
by chance, of men whose singular gifts suddenly melt the
multitude, already at the point of fusion; or suddenly form,
and inform, the multitude which has gained coherence enough
to be capable of formation,&mdash;enables us to measure and map
the gain of national intellectual territory, by tracing first
the lifting of the mountain chains of its genius.

46. I have told you that we have nothing to do at present
with the great transition from ancient to modern habits of
thought which took place at the beginning of the sixteenth
century. I only want to go as far as that point;&mdash;where we
shall find the old superstitious art represented finally by
Perugino, and the modern scientific and anatomical art represented
primarily by Michael Angelo. And the epithet
bestowed on Perugino by Michael Angelo, 'goffo nell' arte,'
dunce, or blockhead, in art,&mdash;being, as far as my knowledge
of history extends, the most cruel, the most false, and the
most foolish insult ever offered by one great man to another,&mdash;does
you at least good service, in showing how trenchant
the separation is between the two orders of artists,[H]&mdash;how
exclusively we may follow out the history of all the 'goffi
nell' arte,' and write our Florentine Dunciad, and Laus
Stultiti&aelig;, in peace; and never trench upon the thoughts or
ways of these proud ones, who showed their fathers' nakedness,
and snatched their masters' fame.

47. The Florentine dunces in art are a multitude; but I
only want you to know something about twenty of them.

Twenty!&mdash;you think that a grievous number? It may,[Pg 27]
perhaps, appease you a little to be told that when you really
have learned a very little, accurately, about these twenty
dunces, there are only five more men among the artists of
Christendom whose works I shall ask you to examine while
you are under my care. That makes twenty-five altogether,&mdash;an
exorbitant demand on your attention, you still think?
And yet, but a little while ago, you were all agog to get me
to go and look at Mrs. A's sketches, and tell you what was to
be thought about them; and I've had the greatest difficulty to
keep Mrs. B's photographs from being shown side by side
with the Raphael drawings in the University galleries. And
you will waste any quantity of time in looking at Mrs. A's
sketches or Mrs. B's photographs; and yet you look grave,
because, out of nineteen centuries of European art-labor and
thought, I ask you to learn something seriously about the
works of five-and-twenty men!

48. It is hard upon you, doubtless, considering the quantity
of time you must nowadays spend in trying which can hit balls
farthest. So I will put the task into the simplest form I can.







Here are the names of the twenty-five men,[I] and opposite
each, a line indicating the length of his life, and the position
of it in his century. The diagram still, however, needs a
few words of explanation. Very chiefly, for those who know
anything of my writings, there is needed explanation of its
not including the names of Titian, Reynolds, Velasquez,
Turner, and other such men, always reverently put before
you at other times.

They are absent, because I have no fear of your not looking
at these. All your lives through, if you care about art, you
will be looking at them. But while you are here at Oxford,
I want to make you learn what you should know of these
earlier, many of them weaker, men, who yet, for the very
reason of their greater simplicity of power, are better guides
for you, and of whom some will remain guides to all genera[Pg 28]tions.
And, as regards the subject of our present course, I
have a still more weighty reason;&mdash;Vandyke, Gainsborough,
Titian, Reynolds, Velasquez, and the rest, are essentially
portrait painters. They give you the likeness of a man: they
have nothing to say either about his future life, or his gods.
'That is the look of him,' they say: 'here, on earth, we know
no more.'

49. But these, whose names I have engraved, have something
to say&mdash;generally much,&mdash;either about the future life
of man, or about his gods. They are therefore, literally, seers
or prophets. False prophets, it may be, or foolish ones; of
that you must judge; but you must read before you can
judge; and read (or hear) them consistently; for you don't
know them till you have heard them out. But with Sir
Joshua, or Titian, one portrait is as another: it is here a
pretty lady, there a great lord; but speechless, all;&mdash;whereas,
with these twenty-five men, each picture or statue is not
merely another person of a pleasant society, but another
chapter of a Sibylline book.

50. For this reason, then, I do not want Sir Joshua or
Velasquez in my defined group; and for my present purpose,
I can spare from it even four others:&mdash;namely, three who
have too special gifts, and must each be separately studied&mdash;Correggio,
Carpaccio, Tintoret;&mdash;and one who has no special
gift, but a balanced group of many&mdash;Cima. This leaves
twenty-one for classification, of whom I will ask you to lay
hold thus. You must continually have felt the difficulty
caused by the names of centuries not tallying with their years;&mdash;the
year 1201 being the first of the thirteenth century, and
so on. I am always plagued by it myself, much as I have to
think and write with reference to chronology; and I mean for
the future, in our art chronology, to use as far as possible a
different form of notation.

51. In my diagram the vertical lines are the divisions of
tens of years; the thick black lines divide the centuries. The
horizontal lines, then, at a glance, tell you the length and
date of each artist's life. In one or two instances I cannot[Pg 29]
find the date of birth; in one or two more, of death; and
the line indicates then only the ascertained[J] period during
which the artist worked.

And, thus represented, you see nearly all their lives run
through the year of a new century; so that if the lines representing
them were needles, and the black bars of the years
1300, 1400, 1500 were magnets, I could take up nearly all
the needles by lifting the bars.

52. I will actually do this, then, in three other simple
diagrams. I place a rod for the year 1300 over the lines of
life, and I take up all it touches. I have to drop Niccola
Pisano, but I catch five. Now, with my rod of 1400, I have
dropped Orcagna indeed, but I again catch five. Now, with
my rod of 1500, I indeed drop Filippo Lippi and Verrocchio,
but I catch seven. And here I have three pennons, with the
staves of the years 1300, 1400, and 1500 running through
them,&mdash;holding the names of nearly all the men I want you
to study in easily remembered groups of five, five, and seven.
And these three groups I shall hereafter call the 1300 group,
1400 group, and 1500 group.

53. But why should four unfortunate masters be dropped
out?

Well, I want to drop them out, at any rate; but not in
disrespect. In hope, on the contrary, to make you remember
them very separately indeed;&mdash;for this following reason.

We are in the careless habit of speaking of men who form
a great number of pupils, and have a host of inferior satellites
round them, as masters of great schools.

But before you call a man a master, you should ask,
Are his pupils greater or less than himself? If they are
greater than himself, he is a master indeed;&mdash;he has been a
true teacher. But if all his pupils are less than himself, he
may have been a great man, but in all probability has been
a bad master, or no master.[Pg 31]

Now these men, whom I have signally left out of my
groups, are true Masters.

Niccola Pisano taught all Italy; but chiefly his own son,
who succeeded, and in some things very much surpassed him.

Orcagna taught all Italy, after him, down to Michael
Angelo. And these two&mdash;Lippi, the religious schools, Verrocchio,
the artist schools, of their century.

Lippi taught Sandro Botticelli; and Verrocchio taught
Lionardo da Vinci, Lorenzo di Credi, and Perugino. Have
I not good reason to separate the masters of such pupils from
the schools they created?

54. But how is it that I can drop just the cards I want
out of my pack?

Well, certainly I force and fit matters a little: I leave
some men out of my list whom I should like to have in it;&mdash;Benozzo
Gozzoli, for instance, and Mino da Fiesole; but I
can do without them, and so can you also, for the present.
I catch Luca by a hair's-breadth only, with my 1400 rod;
but on the whole, with very little coaxing, I get the groups in
this memorable and quite literally 'handy' form. For see,
I write my lists of five, five, and seven, on bits of pasteboard;
I hinge my rods to these; and you can brandish the school of
1400 in your left hand, and of 1500 in your right, like&mdash;railway
signals;&mdash;and I wish all railway signals were as clear.
Once learn, thoroughly, the groups in this artificially contracted
form, and you can refine and complete afterwards at
your leisure.

55. And thus actually flourishing my two pennons, and
getting my grip of the men, in either hand, I find a notable
thing concerning my two flags. The men whose names I hold
in my left hand are all sculptors; the men whose names I
hold in my right are all painters.

You will infallibly suspect me of having chosen them
thus on purpose. No, honor bright!&mdash;I chose simply the
greatest men,&mdash;those I wanted to talk to you about. I
arranged them by their dates; I put them into three conclusive
pennons; and behold what follows![Pg 32]

56. Farther, note this: in the 1300 group, four out of the
five men are architects as well as sculptors and painters. In
the 1400 group, there is one architect; in the 1500, none.
And the meaning of that is, that in 1300 the arts were all
united, and duly led by architecture; in 1400, sculpture
began to assume too separate a power to herself; in 1500,
painting arrogated all, and, at last, betrayed all. From which,
with much other collateral evidence, you may justly conclude
that the three arts ought to be practiced together, and that
they naturally are so. I long since asserted that no man
could be an architect who was not a sculptor. As I learned
more and more of my business, I perceived also that no man
could be a sculptor who was not an architect;&mdash;that is to say,
who had not knowledge enough, and pleasure enough in
structural law, to be able to build, on occasion, better than a
mere builder. And so, finally, I now positively aver to you
that nobody, in the graphic arts, can be quite rightly a
master of anything, who is not master of everything!

57. The junction of the three arts in men's minds, at the
best times, is shortly signified in these words of Chaucer.
Love's Garden,


Everidele
Enclosed was, and walled well
With high walls, embatailled,
Portrayed without, and well entayled
With many rich portraitures.


The French original is better still, and gives four arts in
unison:&mdash;


Quant suis avant un pou al&eacute;
Et vy un vergier grant et le,
Bien cloz de bon mur batilli&eacute;
Pourtrait dehors, et entailli&eacute;
Ou (for au) maintes riches escriptures.


Read also carefully the description of the temples of
Mars and Venus in the Knight's Tale. Contemporary French
uses 'entaille' even of solid sculpture and of the living
form; and Pygmalion, as a perfect master, professes wood[Pg 33]
carving, ivory carving, waxwork, and iron-work, no less than
stone sculpture:&mdash;


Pimalion, uns entaillieres
Pourtraians en fuz[K] et en pierres,
En mettaux, en os, et en cire,
Et en toute autre matire.


58. I made a little sketch, when last in Florence, of a
subject which will fix the idea of this unity of the arts in
your minds. At the base of the tower of Giotto are two rows
of hexagonal panels, filled with bas-reliefs. Some of these
are by unknown hands,&mdash;some by Andrea Pisano, some by
Luca della Robbia, two by Giotto himself; of these I sketched
the panel representing the art of Painting.

You have in that bas-relief one of the foundation-stones
of the most perfectly built tower in Europe; you have that
stone carved by its architect's own hand; you find, further,
that this architect and sculptor was the greatest painter of
his time, and the friend of the greatest poet; and you have
represented by him a painter in his shop,&mdash;bottega,&mdash;as
symbolic of the entire art of painting.

59. In which representation, please note how carefully
Giotto shows you the tabernacles or niches, in which the
paintings are to be placed. Not independent of their
frames, these panels of his, you see!

Have you ever considered, in the early history of painting,
how important also is the history of the frame maker? It
is a matter, I assure you, needing your very best consideration.
For the frame was made before the picture. The
painted window is much, but the aperture it fills was thought
of before it. The fresco by Giotto is much, but the vault it
adorns was planned first. Who thought of these;&mdash;who
built?

Questions taking us far back before the birth of the shep[Pg 34]herd
boy of F&eacute;sole&mdash;questions not to be answered by history
of painting only, still less of painting in Italy only.

60. And in pointing out to you this fact, I may once for
all prove to you the essential unity of the arts, and show you
how impossible it is to understand one without reference to
another. Which I wish you to observe all the more closely,
that you may use, without danger of being misled, the data,
of unequaled value, which have been collected by Crowe and
Cavalcaselle, in the book which they have called a History of
Painting in Italy, but which is in fact only a dictionary of
details relating to that history. Such a title is an absurdity
on the face of it. For, first, you can no more write the
history of painting in Italy than you can write the history
of the south wind in Italy. The sirocco does indeed produce
certain effects at Genoa, and others at Rome; but what would
be the value of a treatise upon the winds, which, for the honor
of any country, assumed that every city of it had a native
sirocco?

But, further,&mdash;imagine what success would attend the
meteorologist who should set himself to give an account of
the south wind, but take no notice of the north!

And, finally, suppose an attempt to give you an account of
either wind, but none of the seas, or mountain passes, by
which they were nourished, or directed.

61. For instance, I am in this course of lectures to give
you an account of a single and minor branch of graphic art,&mdash;engraving.
But observe how many references to local circumstances
it involves. There are three materials for it, we
said;&mdash;stone, wood, and metal. Stone engraving is the art
of countries possessing marble and gems; wood engraving,
of countries overgrown with forest; metal engraving, of
countries possessing treasures of silver and gold. And the
style of a stone engraver is formed on pillars and pyramids;
the style of a wood engraver under the eaves of larch cottages;
the style of a metal engraver in the treasuries of kings. Do
you suppose I could rightly explain to you the value of a
single touch on brass by Finiguerra, or on box by Bewick,[Pg 35]
unless I had grasp of the great laws of climate and country;
and could trace the inherited sirocco or tramontana of thought
to which the souls and bodies of the men owed their existence?

62. You see that in this flag of 1300 there is a dark strong
line in the center, against which you read the name of
Arnolfo.

In writing our Florentine Dunciad, or History of Fools,
can we possibly begin with a better day than All Fools' Day?
On All Fools' Day&mdash;the first, if you like better so to call it,
of the month of opening,&mdash;in the year 1300, is signed the
document making Arnolfo a citizen of Florence, and in 1310
he dies, chief master of the works of the cathedral there. To
this man, Crowe and Cavalcaselle give half a page, out of
three volumes of five hundred pages each.

But lower down in my flag, (not put there because of any
inferiority, but by order of chronology,) you will see a name
sufficiently familiar to you&mdash;that of Giotto; and to him, our
historians of painting in Italy give some hundred pages,
under the impression, stated by them at page 243 of their
volume, that "in his hands, art in the Peninsula became
entitled for the first time to the name of Italian."

63. Art became Italian! Yes, but what art? Your
authors give a perspective&mdash;or what they call such,&mdash;of the
upper church of Assisi, as if that were merely an accidental
occurrence of blind walls for Giotto to paint on!

But how came the upper church of Assisi there? How
came it to be vaulted&mdash;to be aisled? How came Giotto to be
asked to paint upon it?

The art that built it, good or bad, must have been an Italian
one, before Giotto. He could not have painted on the air.
Let us see how his panels were made for him.

64. This Captain&mdash;the center of our first group&mdash;Arnolfo,
has always hitherto been called 'Arnolfo di Lapo;'&mdash;Arnolfo
the son of Lapo.

Modern investigators come down on us delightedly, to tell
us&mdash;Arnolfo was not the son of Lapo.

In these days you will have half a dozen doctors, writing[Pg 36]
each a long book, and the sense of all will be,&mdash;Arnolfo wasn't
the son of Lapo. Much good may you get of that!

Well, you will find the fact to be, there was a great Northman
builder, a true son of Thor, who came down into Italy
in 1200, served the order of St. Francis there, built Assisi,
taught Arnolfo how to build, with Thor's hammer, and disappeared,
leaving his name uncertain&mdash;Jacopo&mdash;Lapo&mdash;nobody
knows what. Arnolfo always recognizes this man as his true
father, who put the soul-life into him; he is known to his
Florentines always as Lapo's Arnolfo.

That, or some likeness of that, is the vital fact. You never
can get at the literal limitation of living facts. They disguise
themselves by the very strength of their life: get told again
and again in different ways by all manner of people;&mdash;the
literalness of them is turned topsy-turvy, inside-out, over and
over again;&mdash;then the fools come and read them wrong side
upwards, or else, say there never was a fact at all. Nothing
delights a true blockhead so much as to prove a negative;&mdash;to
show that everybody has been wrong. Fancy the delicious
sensation, to an empty-headed creature, of fancying for a
moment that he has emptied everybody else's head as well as
his own! nay, that, for once, his own hollow bottle of a head
has had the best of other bottles, and has been first empty;&mdash;first
to know&mdash;nothing.

65. Hold, then, steadily the first tradition about this
Arnolfo. That his real father was called "Cambio" matters
to you not a straw. That he never called himself Cambio's
Arnolfo&mdash;that nobody else ever called him so, down to
Vasari's time, is an infinitely significant fact to you. In my
twenty-second letter in Fors Clavigera you will find some
account of the noble habit of the Italian artists to call themselves
by their masters' names, considering their master as
their true father. If not the name of the master, they take
that of their native place, as having owed the character of
their life to that. They rarely take their own family name:
sometimes it is not even known,&mdash;when best known, it is
unfamiliar to us. The great Pisan artists, for instance,[Pg 37]
never bear any other name than 'the Pisan;' among the other
five-and-twenty names in my list, not above six, I think, the
two German, with four Italian, are family names. Perugino,
(Peter of Perugia,) Luini, (Bernard of Luino,) Quercia,
(James of Quercia,) Correggio, (Anthony of Correggio,) are
named from their native places. Nobody would have understood
me if I had called Giotto, 'Ambrose Bondone;' or
Tintoret, Robusti; or even Raphael, Sanzio. Botticelli is
named from his master; Ghiberti from his father-in-law; and
Ghirlandajo from his work. Orcagna, who did, for a wonder,
name himself from his father, Andrea Cione, of Florence,
has been always called 'Angel' by everybody else; while
Arnolfo, who never named himself from his father, is now
like to be fathered against his will.

But, I again beg of you, keep to the old story. For it
represents, however inaccurately in detail, clearly in sum, the
fact, that some great master of German Gothic at this time
came down into Italy, and changed the entire form of Italian
architecture by his touch. So that while Niccola and Giovanni
Pisano are still virtually Greek artists, experimentally
introducing Gothic forms, Arnolfo and Giotto adopt the entire
Gothic ideal of form, and thenceforward use the pointed arch
and steep gable as the limits of sculpture.

66. Hitherto I have been speaking of the relations of my
twenty-five men to each other. But now, please note their
relations altogether to the art before them. These twenty-five
include, I say, all the great masters of Christian
art.

Before them, the art was too savage to be Christian; afterwards,
too carnal to be Christian.

Too savage to be Christian? I will justify that assertion
hereafter; but you will find that the European art of 1200
includes all the most developed and characteristic conditions
of the style in the north which you have probably been
accustomed to think of as Norman, and which you may
always most conveniently call so; and the most developed
conditions of the style in the south, which, formed out of[Pg 38]
effete Greek, Persian, and Roman tradition, you may, in
like manner, most conveniently express by the familiar word
Byzantine. Whatever you call them, they are in origin
adverse in temper, and remain so up to the year 1200. Then
an influence appears, seemingly that of one man, Nicholas
the Pisan, (our first Master, observe,) and a new spirit
adopts what is best in each, and gives to what it adopts a new
energy of its own; namely, this conscientious and didactic
power which is the speciality of its progressive existence.
And just as the new-born and natural art of Athens collects
and reanimates Pelasgian and Egyptian tradition, purifying
their worship, and perfecting their work, into the living
heathen faith of the world, so this new-born and natural
art of Florence collects and animates the Norman and
Byzantine tradition, and forms out of the perfected worship
and work of both, the honest Christian faith, and vital craftsmanship,
of the world.

67. Get this first summary, therefore, well into your minds.
The word 'Norman' I use roughly for North-savage;&mdash;roughly,
but advisedly. I mean Lombard, Scandinavian,
Frankish; everything north-savage that you can think of,
except Saxon. (I have a reason for that exception; never
mind it just now.)[L]

All north-savage I call Norman, all south-savage I call
Byzantine; this latter including dead native Greek primarily&mdash;then
dead foreign Greek, in Rome;&mdash;then Arabian&mdash;Persian&mdash;Ph&oelig;nician&mdash;Indian&mdash;all
you can think of, in art
of hot countries, up to this year 1200, I rank under the one
term Byzantine. Now all this cold art&mdash;Norman, and all this
hot art&mdash;Byzantine, is virtually dead, till 1200. It has no[Pg 39]
conscience, no didactic power;[M] it is devoid of both, in the
sense that dreams are.

Then in the thirteenth century, men wake as if they heard
an alarum through the whole vault of heaven, and true human
life begins again, and the cradle of this life is the Val d'Arno.
There the northern and southern nations meet; there they
lay down their enmities; there they are first baptized unto
John's baptism for the remission of sins; there is born, and
thence exiled,&mdash;thought faithless, for breaking the font of
baptism to save a child from drowning, in his 'bel San Giovanni,'&mdash;the
greatest of Christian poets; he who had pity
even for the lost.

68. Now, therefore, my whole history of Christian architecture
and painting begins with this Baptistery of Florence,
and with its associated Cathedral. Arnolfo brought the one
into the form in which you now see it; he laid the foundation
of the other, and that to purpose, and he is therefore the
Captain of our first school.

For this Florentine Baptistery[N] is the great one of the
world. Here is the center of Christian knowledge and power.

And it is one piece of large engraving. White substance,
cut into, and filled with black, and dark-green.

No more perfect work was afterwards done; and I wish you
to grasp the idea of this building clearly and irrevocably,&mdash;first,
in order (as I told you in a previous lecture) to quit
yourselves thoroughly of the idea that ornament should be[Pg 40]
decorated construction; and, secondly, as the noblest type of
the intaglio ornamentation, which developed itself into all
minor application of black and white to engraving.

69. That it should do so first at Florence, was the natural
sequence, and the just reward, of the ancient skill of Etruria
in chased metal-work. The effects produced in gold, either
by embossing or engraving, were the direct means of giving
interest to his surfaces at the command of the 'auri faber,'
or orfevre: and every conceivable artifice of studding, chiseling,
and interlacing was exhausted by the artists in gold, who
were at the head of the metal-workers, and from whom the
ranks of the sculptors were reinforced.

The old French word 'orfroiz,' (aurifrigia,) expresses
essentially what we call 'frosted' work in gold; that which
resembles small dew or crystals of hoar-frost; the 'frigia'
coming from the Latin frigus. To chase, or enchase, is not
properly said of the gold; but of the jewel which it secures
with hoops or ridges, (French, enchasser[O]). Then the
armorer, or cup and casket maker, added to this kind of
decoration that of flat inlaid enamel; and the silver-worker,
finding that the raised filigree (still a staple at Genoa) only
attracted tarnish, or got crushed, early sought to decorate a
surface which would bear external friction, with labyrinths
of safe incision.



70. Of the security of incision as a means of permanent
decoration, as opposed to ordinary carving, here is a beautiful
instance in the base of one of the external shafts of the
Cathedral of Lucca; thirteenth-century work, which by this
time, had it been carved in relief, would have been a shapeless
remnant of indecipherable bosses. But it is still as safe
as if it had been cut yesterday, because the smooth round
mass of the pillar is entirely undisturbed; into that, furrows
are cut with a chisel as much under command and as powerful
as a burin. The effect of the design is trusted entirely to the
depth of these incisions&mdash;here dying out and expiring in the
light of the marble, there deepened, by drill holes, into as[Pg 41]
definitely a black line as if it were drawn with ink; and
describing the outline of the leafage with a delicacy of touch
and of perception which no man will ever surpass, and which
very few have rivaled, in the proudest days of design.

71. This security, in silver plates, was completed by filling
the furrows with the black paste which at once exhibited and
preserved them. The transition from that niello-work to
modern engraving is one of no real moment: my object is to
make you understand the qualities which constitute the merit
of the engraving, whether charged with niello or ink. And
this I hope ultimately to accomplish by studying with you
some of the works of the four men, Botticelli and Mantegna
in the south, D&uuml;rer and Holbein in the north, whose names
I have put in our last flag, above and beneath those of the
three mighty painters, Perugino the captain, Bellini on one
side&mdash;Luini on the other.

The four following lectures[P] will contain data necessary
for such study: you must wait longer before I can place before
you those by which I can justify what must greatly surprise
some of my audience&mdash;my having given Perugino the captain's
place among the three painters.

72. But I do so, at least primarily, because what is commonly
thought affected in his design is indeed the true
remains of the great architectural symmetry which was soon
to be lost, and which makes him the true follower of Arnolfo
and Brunelleschi; and because he is a sound craftsman and
workman to the very heart's core. A noble, gracious, and
quiet laborer from youth to death,&mdash;never weary, never
impatient, never untender, never untrue. Not Tintoret in
power, not Raphael in flexibility, not Holbein in veracity,
not Luini in love,&mdash;their gathered gifts he has, in balanced
and fruitful measure, fit to be the guide, and impulse, and
father of all.

LECTURE III.

THE TECHNICS OF WOOD ENGRAVING.


73. I am to-day to begin to tell you what it is necessary
you should observe respecting methods of manual execution
in the two great arts of engraving. Only to begin to tell you.
There need be no end of telling you such things, if you care
to hear them. The theory of art is soon mastered; but 'dal
detto al fatto, v'e gran tratto;' and as I have several times
told you in former lectures, every day shows me more and
more the importance of the Hand.

74. Of the hand as a Servant, observe,&mdash;not of the hand
as a Master. For there are two great kinds of manual work:
one in which the hand is continually receiving and obeying
orders; the other in which it is acting independently, or even
giving orders of its own. And the dependent and submissive
hand is a noble hand; but the independent or imperative
hand is a vile one.

That is to say, as long as the pen, or chisel, or other graphic
instrument, is moved under the direct influence of mental
attention, and obeys orders of the brain, it is working nobly;&mdash;the
moment it moves independently of them, and performs
some habitual dexterity of its own, it is base.

75. Dexterity&mdash;I say;&mdash;some 'right-handedness' of its
own. We might wisely keep that word for what the hand
does at the mind's bidding; and use an opposite word&mdash;sinisterity,&mdash;for
what it does at its own. For indeed we want
such a word in speaking of modern art; it is all full of sinisterity.
Hands independent of brains;&mdash;the left hand, by
division of labor, not knowing what the right does,&mdash;still
less what it ought to do.

76. Turning, then, to our special subject. All engraving,[Pg 43]
I said, is intaglio in the solid. But the solid, in wood engraving,
is a coarse substance, easily cut; and in metal, a fine
substance, not easily. Therefore, in general, you may be
prepared to accept ruder and more elementary work in one
than the other; and it will be the means of appeal to blunter
minds.

You probably already know the difference between the
actual methods of producing a printed impression from wood
and metal; but I may perhaps make the matter a little more
clear. In metal engraving, you cut ditches, fill them with
ink, and press your paper into them. In wood engraving,
you leave ridges, rub the tops of them with ink, and stamp
them on your paper.

The instrument with which the substance, whether of the
wood or steel, is cut away, is the same. It is a solid plowshare,
which, instead of throwing the earth aside, throws it
up and out, producing at first a simple ravine, or furrow,
in the wood or metal, which you can widen by another cut,
or extend by successive cuts. This (Fig. 1) is the general
shape of the solid plowshare:
but it is of course made sharper or blunter at pleasure. The
furrow produced is at first the wedge-shaped or cuneiform
ravine, already so much dwelt upon in my lectures on Greek
sculpture.



Fig. 1


77. Since, then, in wood printing, you print from the
surface left solid; and, in metal printing, from the hollows
cut into it, it follows that if you put few touches on wood,
you draw, as on a slate, with white lines, leaving a quantity
of black; but if you put few touches on metal, you draw
with black lines, leaving a quantity of white.[Pg 44]

Now the eye is not in the least offended by quantity of
white, but is, or ought to be, greatly saddened and offended by
quantity of black. Hence it follows that you must never
put little work on wood. You must not sketch upon it. You
may sketch on metal as much as you please.

78. "Paradox," you will say, as usual. "Are not all
our journals,&mdash;and the best of them, Punch, par excellence,&mdash;full
of the most brilliantly swift and slight sketches,
engraved on wood; while line-engravings take ten years to
produce, and cost ten guineas each when they are done?"

Yes, that is so; but observe, in the first place, what appears
to you a sketch on wood is not so at all, but a most laborious
and careful imitation of a sketch on paper; whereas when
you see what appears to be a sketch on metal, it is one. And
in the second place, so far as the popular fashion is contrary
to this natural method,&mdash;so far as we do in reality try to
produce effects of sketching in wood, and of finish in metal,&mdash;our
work is wrong.

Those apparently careless and free sketches on the wood
ought to have been stern and deliberate; those exquisitely
toned and finished engravings on metal ought to have looked,
instead, like free ink sketches on white paper. That is the
theorem which I propose to you for consideration, and
which, in the two branches of its assertion, I hope to prove
to you; the first part of it, (that wood-cutting should be
careful,) in this present lecture; the second, (that metal-cutting
should be, at least in a far greater degree than it is
now, slight, and free,) in the following one.

79. Next, observe the distinction in respect of thickness,
no less than number, of lines which may properly be used in
the two methods.

In metal engraving, it is easier to lay a fine line than a
thick one; and however fine the line may be, it lasts;&mdash;but
in wood engraving it requires extreme precision and skill to
leave a thin dark line, and when left, it will be quickly beaten
down by a careless printer. Therefore, the virtue of wood
engraving is to exhibit the qualities and power of thick lines;[Pg 45]
and of metal engraving, to exhibit the qualities and power of
thin ones.

All thin dark lines, therefore, in wood, broadly speaking,
are to be used only in case of necessity; and thick lines, on
metal, only in case of necessity.

80. Though, however, thin dark lines cannot easily be
produced in wood, thin light ones may be struck in an instant.
Nevertheless, even thin light ones must not be used, except
with extreme caution. For observe, they are equally useless
as outline, and for expression of mass. You know how far
from exemplary or delightful your boy's first quite voluntary
exercises in white line drawing on your slate were?
You could, indeed, draw a goblin satisfactorily in such
method;&mdash;a round O, with arms and legs to it, and a scratch
under two dots in the middle, would answer the purpose;
but if you wanted to draw a pretty face, you took pencil or
pen, and paper&mdash;not your slate. Now, that instinctive feeling
that a white outline is wrong, is deeply founded. For
Nature herself draws with diffused light, and concentrated
dark;&mdash;never, except in storm or twilight, with diffused
dark, and concentrated light; and the thing we all like best
to see drawn&mdash;the human face&mdash;cannot be drawn with white
touches, but by extreme labor. For the pupil and iris of the
eye, the eyebrow, the nostril, and the lip are all set in dark
on pale ground. You can't draw a white eyebrow, a white
pupil of the eye, a white nostril, and a white mouth, on a dark
ground. Try it, and see what a specter you get. But the
same number of dark touches, skillfully applied, will give the
idea of a beautiful face. And what is true of the subtlest
subject you have to represent, is equally true of inferior ones.
Nothing lovely can be quickly represented by white touches.
You must hew out, if your means are so restricted, the form
by sheer labor; and that both cunning and dextrous. The
Florentine masters, and D&uuml;rer, often practice the achievement,
and there are many drawings by the Lippis, Mantegna,
and other leading Italian draughtsmen, completed to great
perfection with the white line; but only for the sake of[Pg 46]
severest study, nor is their work imitable by inferior men.
And such studies, however accomplished, always mark a
disposition to regard chiaroscuro too much, and local color
too little.

We conclude, then, that we must never trust, in wood, to
our power of outline with white; and our general laws, thus
far determined, will be&mdash;thick lines in wood; thin ones in
metal; complete drawing on wood; sketches, if we choose, on
metal.

81. But why, in wood, lines at all? Why not cut out
white spaces, and use the chisel as if its incisions were so
much white paint? Many fine pieces of wood-cutting are
indeed executed on this principle. Bewick does nearly all
his foliage so; and continually paints the light plumes of
his birds with single touches of his chisel, as if he were laying
on white.

But this is not the finest method of wood-cutting. It
implies the idea of a system of light and shade in which the
shadow is totally black. Now, no light and shade can be good,
much less pleasant, in which all the shade is stark black.
Therefore the finest wood-cutting ignores light and shade,
and expresses only form, and dark local color. And it is convenient,
for simplicity's sake, to anticipate what I should
otherwise defer telling you until next lecture, that fine
metal engraving, like fine wood-cutting, ignores light and
shade; and that, in a word, all good engraving whatsoever
does so.

82. I hope that my saying so will make you eager to interrupt
me. 'What! Rembrandt's etchings, and Lupton's
mezzotints, and Le Keux's line-work,&mdash;do you mean to tell
us that these ignore light and shade?'

I never said that mezzotint ignored light and shade, or
ought to do so. Mezzotint is properly to be considered as
chiaroscuro drawing on metal. But I do mean to tell you
that both Rembrandt's etchings, and Le Keux's finished line-work,
are misapplied labor, in so far as they regard chiar[Pg 47]oscuro;
and that consummate engraving never uses it as a
primal element of pleasure.






THE LAST FURROW.
(Fig. 2) Facsimile from Holbein's woodcut.


83. We have now got our principles so far defined that I
can proceed to illustration of them by example.

Here are facsimiles, very marvelous ones,[Q] of two of the
best wood engravings ever produced by art,&mdash;two subjects
in Holbein's Dance of Death. You will probably like best
that I should at once proceed to verify my last and most
startling statement, that fine engraving disdained chiaroscuro.

This vignette (Fig. 2) represents a sunset in the open
mountainous fields of southern Germany. And Holbein is
so entirely careless about the light and shade, which a
Dutchman would first have thought of, as resulting from the
sunset, that, as he works, he forgets altogether where his
light comes from. Here, actually, the shadow of the figure
is cast from the side, right across the picture, while the sun
is in front. And there is not the slightest attempt to indicate
gradation of light in the sky, darkness in the forest, or any
other positive element of chiaroscuro.

This is not because Holbein cannot give chiaroscuro if he
chooses. He is twenty times a stronger master of it than
Rembrandt; but he, therefore, knows exactly when and how
to use it; and that wood engraving is not the proper means
for it. The quantity of it which is needful for his story, and
will not, by any sensational violence, either divert, or vulgarly
enforce, the attention, he will give; and that with an unrivaled
subtlety. Therefore I must ask you for a moment or
two to quit the subject of technics, and look what these two
woodcuts mean.

84. The one I have first shown you is of a plowman
plowing at evening. It is Holbein's object, here, to express
the diffused and intense light of a golden summer sunset, so
far as is consistent with grander purposes. A modern French
or English chiaroscurist would have covered his sky with[Pg 48]
fleecy clouds, and relieved the plowman's hat and his horses
against it in strong black, and put sparkling touches on the
furrows and grass. Holbein scornfully casts all such tricks
aside; and draws the whole scene in pure white, with simple
outlines.






THE TWO PREACHERS.
(Fig. 3) Facsimile from Holbein's woodcut.



85. And yet, when I put it beside this second vignette,
(Fig. 3,) which is of a preacher preaching in a feebly lighted
church, you will feel that the diffused warmth of the one
subject, and diffused twilight in the other, are complete;
and they will finally be to you more impressive than if they
had been wrought out with every superficial means of effect,
on each block.

For it is as a symbol, not as a scenic effect, that in each
case the chiaroscuro is given. Holbein, I said, is at the head
of the painter-reformers, and his Dance of Death is the most
energetic and telling of all the forms given, in this epoch,
to the Rationalist spirit of reform, preaching the new Gospel
of Death,&mdash;"It is no matter whether you are priest or layman,
what you believe, or what you do: here is the end."
You shall see, in the course of our inquiry, that Botticelli,
in like manner, represents the Faithful and Catholic temper
of reform.

86. The teaching of Holbein is therefore always melancholy,&mdash;for
the most part purely rational; and entirely furious
in its indignation against all who, either by actual
injustice in this life, or by what he holds to be false promise
of another, destroy the good, or the energy, of the few days
which man has to live. Against the rich, the luxurious, the
Pharisee, the false lawyer, the priest, and the unjust judge,
Holbein uses his fiercest mockery; but he is never himself
unjust; never caricatures or equivocates; gives the facts as
he knows them, with explanatory symbols, few and clear.

87. Among the powers which he hates, the pathetic and
ingenious preaching of untruth is one of the chief; and it is
curious to find his biographer, knowing this, and reasoning,
as German critics nearly always do, from acquired knowledge,
not perception, imagine instantly that he sees hypocrisy[Pg 49]
in the face of Holbein's preacher. "How skillfully," says
Dr. Woltmann, "is the preacher propounding his doctrines;
how thoroughly is his hypocrisy expressed in the features of
his countenance, and in the gestures of his hands." But look
at the cut yourself, candidly. I challenge you to find the
slightest trace of hypocrisy in either feature or gesture.
Holbein knew better. It is not the hypocrite who has
power in the pulpit. It is the sincere preacher of untruth
who does mischief there. The hypocrite's place of power
is in trade, or in general society; none but the sincere ever
get fatal influence in the pulpit. This man is a refined gentleman&mdash;ascetic,
earnest, thoughtful, and kind. He scarcely
uses the vantage even of his pulpit,&mdash;comes aside out of it,
as an eager man would, pleading; he is intent on being understood&mdash;is
understood; his congregation are delighted&mdash;you
might hear a pin drop among them: one is asleep indeed,
who cannot see him, (being under the pulpit,) and asleep
just because the teacher is as gentle as he is earnest, and
speaks quietly.

88. How are we to know, then, that he speaks in vain?
First, because among all his hearers you will not find one
shrewd face. They are all either simple or stupid people:
there is one nice woman in front of all, (else Holbein's
representation had been caricature,) but she is not a shrewd
one.

Secondly, by the light and shade. The church is not in
extreme darkness&mdash;far from that; a gray twilight is over
everything, but the sun is totally shut out of it;&mdash;not a ray
comes in even at the window&mdash;that is darker than the walls,
or vault.

Lastly, and chiefly, by the mocking expression of Death.
Mocking, but not angry. The man has been preaching what
he thought true. Death laughs at him, but is not indignant
with him.

Death comes quietly: I am going to be preacher now; here
is your own hour-glass, ready for me. You have spoken
many words in your day. But "of the things which you[Pg 50]
have spoken, this is the sum,"&mdash;your death-warrant, signed
and sealed. There's your text for to-day.

89. Of this other picture, the meaning is more plain, and
far more beautiful. The husbandman is old and gaunt, and
has passed his days, not in speaking, but pressing the iron
into the ground. And the payment for his life's work is, that
he is clothed in rags, and his feet are bare on the clods; and
he has no hat&mdash;but the brim of a hat only, and his long,
unkempt gray hair comes through. But all the air is full of
warmth and of peace; and, beyond his village church, there
is, at last, light indeed. His horses lag in the furrow, and his
own limbs totter and fail: but one comes to help him. 'It is
a long field,' says Death; 'but we'll get to the end of it
to-day,&mdash;you and I.'

90. And now that we know the meaning, we are able to
discuss the technical qualities farther.

Both of these engravings, you will find, are executed with
blunt lines; but more than that, they are executed with quiet
lines, entirely steady.

Now, here I have in my hand a lively woodcut of the
present day&mdash;a good average type of the modern style of
wood-cutting, which you will all recognize.[R]

The shade in this is drawn on the wood, (not cut, but
drawn, observe,) at the rate of at least ten lines in a second:
Holbein's, at the rate of about one line in three seconds.[S]

91. Now there are two different matters to be considered
with respect to these two opposed methods of execution. The
first, that the rapid work, though easy to the artist, is very
difficult to the wood-cutter; so that it implies instantly a separation
between the two crafts, and that your wood-cutter has
ceased to be a draughtsman. I shall return to this point. I
wish to insist on the other first; namely, the effect of the
more deliberate method on the drawing itself.[Pg 51]

92. When the hand moves at the rate of ten lines in a
second, it is indeed under the government of the muscles of
the wrist and shoulder; but it cannot possibly be under the
complete government of the brains. I am able to do this
zigzag line evenly, because I have got the use of the hand
from practice; and the faster it is done, the evener it will be.
But I have no mental authority over every line I thus lay:
chance regulates them. Whereas, when I draw at the rate of
two or three seconds to each line, my hand disobeys the muscles
a little&mdash;the mechanical accuracy is not so great; nay,
there ceases to be any appearance of dexterity at all. But
there is, in reality, more manual skill required in the slow
work than in the swift,&mdash;and all the while the hand is
thoroughly under the orders of the brains. Holbein deliberately
resolves, for every line, as it goes along, that it shall
be so thick, so far from the next,&mdash;that it shall begin here,
and stop there. And he is deliberately assigning the utmost
quantity of meaning to it, that a line will carry.

93. It is not fair, however, to compare common work of
one age with the best of another. Here is a woodcut of
Tenniel's, which I think contains as high qualities as it is
possible to find in modern art.[T] I hold it as beyond others
fine, because there is not the slightest caricature in it. No
face, no attitude, is pushed beyond the degree of natural
humor they would have possessed in life; and in precision of
momentary expression, the drawing is equal to the art of
any time, and shows power which would, if regulated, be
quite adequate to producing an immortal work.

94. Why, then, is it not immortal? You yourselves, in
compliance with whose demand it was done, forgot it the next
week. It will become historically interesting; but no man
of true knowledge and feeling will ever keep this in his
cabinet of treasure, as he does these woodcuts of Holbein's.

The reason is that this is base coin,&mdash;alloyed gold. There[Pg 52]
is gold in it, but also a quantity of brass and lead&mdash;willfully
added&mdash;to make it fit for the public. Holbein's is beaten
gold, seven times tried in the fire. Of which commonplace
but useful metaphor the meaning here is, first, that to catch
the vulgar eye a quantity of,&mdash;so-called,&mdash;light and shade is
added by Tenniel. It is effective to an ignorant eye, and is
ingeniously disposed; but it is entirely conventional and
false, unendurable by any person who knows what chiaroscuro
is.

Secondly, for one line that Holbein lays, Tenniel has a
dozen. There are, for instance, a hundred and fifty-seven
lines in Sir Peter Teazle's wig, without counting dots and
slight cross-hatching;&mdash;but the entire face and flowing hair
of Holbein's preacher are done with forty-five lines, all told.

95. Now observe what a different state of mind the two
artists must be in on such conditions;&mdash;one, never in a hurry,
never doing anything that he knows is wrong; never doing
a line badly that he can do better; and appealing only to the
feelings of sensitive persons, and the judgment of attentive
ones. That is Holbein's habit of soul. What is the habit
of soul of every modern engraver? Always in a hurry; everywhere
doing things which he knows to be wrong&mdash;(Tenniel
knows his light and shade to be wrong as well as I do)&mdash;continually
doing things badly which he was able to do better;
and appealing exclusively to the feelings of the dull, and the
judgment of the inattentive.

Do you suppose that is not enough to make the difference
between mortal and immortal art,&mdash;the original genius being
supposed alike in both?[U]

96. Thus far of the state of the artist himself. I pass, next
to the relation between him and his subordinate, the wood-cutter.[Pg 53]

The modern artist requires him to cut a hundred and fifty-seven
lines in the wig only,&mdash;the old artist requires him to
cut forty-five for the face, and long hair, altogether. The
actual proportion is roughly, and on the average, about one
to twenty of cost in manual labor, ancient to modern,&mdash;the
twentieth part of the mechanical labor, to produce an immortal
instead of a perishable work,&mdash;the twentieth part of the
labor; and&mdash;which is the greatest difference of all&mdash;that
twentieth part, at once less mechanically difficult, and more
mentally pleasant. Mr. Otley, in his general History of
Engraving, says, "The greatest difficulty in wood engraving
occurs in clearing out the minute quadrangular lights;" and
in any modern woodcut you will see that where the lines
of the drawing cross each other to produce shade, the white
interstices are cut out so neatly that there is no appearance
of any jag or break in the lines; they look exactly as if they
had been drawn with a pen. It is chiefly difficult to cut the
pieces clearly out when the lines cross at right angles; easier
when they form oblique or diamond-shaped interstices; but
in any case some half-dozen cuts, and in square crossings as
many as twenty, are required to clear one interstice. Therefore
if I carelessly draw six strokes with my pen across other
six, I produce twenty-five interstices, each of which will need
at least six, perhaps twenty, careful touches of the burin to
clear out.&mdash;Say ten for an average; and I demand two hundred
and fifty exquisitely precise touches from my engraver,
to render ten careless ones of mine.

97. Now I take up Punch, at his best. The whole of the
left side of John Bull's waistcoat&mdash;the shadow on his knee-breeches
and great-coat&mdash;the whole of the Lord Chancellor's
gown, and of John Bull's and Sir Peter Teazle's complexions,
are worked with finished precision of cross-hatching.
These have indeed some purpose in their texture; but in the
most wanton and gratuitous way, the wall below the window
is cross-hatched too, and that not with a double, but a treble
line (Fig. 4).[Pg 54]

There are about thirty of these columns, with thirty-five
interstices each: approximately, 1,050&mdash;certainly not fewer&mdash;interstices
to be deliberately cut clear,
to get that two inches square of shadow.
Now calculate&mdash;or think enough to
feel the impossibility of calculating&mdash;the
number of woodcuts used daily for
our popular prints, and how many men
are night and day cutting 1,050 square
holes to the square inch, as the occupation
of their manly life. And Mrs. Beecher Stowe and the
North Americans fancy they have abolished slavery!






Fig. 4.


98. The workman cannot have even the consolation of
pride; for his task, even in its finest accomplishment, is not
really difficult,&mdash;only tedious. When you have once got into
the practice, it is as easy as lying. To cut regular holes
without a purpose is easy enough; but to cut irregular holes
with a purpose, that is difficult, forever;&mdash;no tricks of tool
or trade will give you power to do that.

The supposed difficulty&mdash;the thing which, at all events,
it takes time to learn, is to cut the interstices neat, and each
like the other. But is there any reason, do you suppose, for
their being neat, and each like the other? So far from it,
they would be twenty times prettier if they were irregular,
and each different from the other. And an old wood-cutter,
instead of taking pride in cutting these interstices smooth
and alike, resolutely cuts them rough and irregular; taking
care, at the same time, never to have any more than are
wanted, this being only one part of the general system of
intelligent manipulation, which made so good an artist of the
engraver that it is impossible to say of any standard old woodcut,
whether the draughtsman engraved it himself or not.
I should imagine, from the character and subtlety of the
touch, that every line of the Dance of Death had been
engraved by Holbein; we know it was not, and that there can
be no certainty given by even the finest pieces of wood execution
of anything more than perfect harmony between the[Pg 55]
designer and workman. And consider how much this harmony
demands in the latter. Not that the modern engraver
is unintelligent in applying his mechanical skill: very often
he greatly improves the drawing; but we never could mistake
his hand for Holbein's.

99. The true merit, then, of wood execution, as regards
this matter of cross-hatching, is first that there be no more
crossing than necessary; secondly, that all the interstices be
various, and rough. You may look through the entire series
of the Dance of Death without finding any cross-hatching
whatever, except in a few unimportant bits of background,
so rude as to need scarcely more than one touch to each
interstice. Albert D&uuml;rer crosses more definitely; but yet, in
any fold of his drapery, every white spot differs in size from
every other, and the arrangement of the whole is delightful,
by the kind of variety which the spots on a leopard have.

On the other hand, where either expression or form can
be rendered by the shape of the lights and darks, the old
engraver becomes as careful as in an ordinary ground he is
careless.

The endeavor, with your own hand, and common pen and
ink, to copy a small piece of either of the two Holbein woodcuts
(Figures 2 and  3) will prove this to you better than any
words.

100. I said that, had Tenniel been rightly trained, there
might have been the making of a Holbein, or nearly a Holbein,
in him. I do not know; but I can turn from his work to
that of a man who was not trained at all, and who was,
without training, Holbein's equal.

Equal, in the sense that this brown stone, in my left hand,
is the equal, though not the likeness, of that in my right.
They are both of the same true and pure crystal; but the one
is brown with iron, and never touched by forming hand;
the other has never been in rough companionship, and has
been exquisitely polished. So with these two men. The one
was the companion of Erasmus and Sir Thomas More. His
father was so good an artist that you cannot always tell their[Pg 56]
drawings asunder. But the other was a farmer's son; and
learned his trade in the back shops of Newcastle.

Yet the first book I asked you to get was his biography;
and in this frame are set together a drawing by Hans Holbein,
and one by Thomas Bewick. I know which is most scholarly;
but I do not know which is best.

101. It is much to say for the self-taught Englishman;&mdash;yet
do not congratulate yourselves on his simplicity. I
told you, a little while since, that the English nobles had left
the history of birds to be written, and their spots to be drawn,
by a printer's lad;&mdash;but I did not tell you their farther loss
in the fact that this printer's lad could have written their own
histories, and drawn their own spots, if they had let him.
But they had no history to be written; and were too closely
maculate to be portrayed;&mdash;white ground in most places
altogether obscured. Had there been Mores and Henrys
to draw, Bewick could have drawn them; and would have
found his function. As it was, the nobles of his day left
him to draw the frogs, and pigs, and sparrows&mdash;of his day,
which seemed to him, in his solitude, the best types of its
Nobility. No sight or thought of beautiful things was ever
granted him;&mdash;no heroic creature, goddess-born&mdash;how much
less any native Deity&mdash;ever shone upon him. To his utterly
English mind, the straw of the sty, and its tenantry, were
abiding truth;&mdash;the cloud of Olympus, and its tenantry, a
child's dream. He could draw a pig, but not an Aphrodite.

102. The three pieces of woodcut from his Fables (the
two lower ones enlarged) in the opposite plate, show his
utmost strength and utmost rudeness. I must endeavor to
make you thoroughly understand both:&mdash;the magnificent
artistic power, the flawless virtue, veracity, tenderness,&mdash;the
infinite humor of the man; and yet the difference between
England and Florence, in the use they make of such gifts
in their children.

For the moment, however, I confine myself to the examination
of technical points; and we must follow our former
conclusions a little further.[Pg 57]





I.
Things Celestial and Terrestrial, as apparent
to the English Mind.


103. Because our lines in wood must be thick, it becomes
an extreme virtue in wood engraving to economize lines,&mdash;not
merely, as in all other art, to save time and power, but
because, our lines being necessarily blunt, we must make up
our minds to do with fewer, by many, than are in the object.
But is this necessarily a disadvantage?

Absolutely, an immense disadvantage,&mdash;a woodcut never
can be so beautiful or good a thing as a painting, or line
engraving. But in its own separate and useful way, an
excellent thing, because, practiced rightly, it exercises in the
artist, and summons in you, the habit of abstraction; that
is to say, of deciding what are the essential points in the
things you see, and seizing these; a habit entirely necessary
to strong humanity; and so natural to all humanity, that it
leads, in its indolent and undisciplined states, to all the vulgar
amateur's liking of sketches better than pictures. The sketch
seems to put the thing for him into a concentrated and exciting
form.

104. Observe, therefore, to guard you from this error,
that a bad sketch is good for nothing; and that nobody can
make a good sketch unless they generally are trying to finish
with extreme care. But the abstraction of the essential
particulars in his subject by a line-master, has a peculiar
didactic value. For painting, when it is complete, leaves it
much to your own judgment what to look at; and, if you are
a fool, you look at the wrong thing;&mdash;but in a fine woodcut,
the master says to you, "You shall look at this, or at nothing."

105. For example, here is a little tailpiece of Bewick's,
to the fable of the Frogs and the Stork.[V] He is, as I told
you, as stout a reformer as Holbein,[W] or Botticelli, or Luther,
or Savonarola; and, as an impartial reformer, hits right and
left, at lower or upper classes, if he sees them wrong. Most
frequently, he strikes at vice, without reference to class; but
in this vignette he strikes definitely at the degradation of
the viler popular mind which is incapable of being governed,
because it cannot understand the nobleness of kingship. He[Pg 58]
has written&mdash;better than written, engraved, sure to suffer no
slip of type&mdash;his legend under the drawing; so that we know
his meaning:

"Set them up with a king, indeed!"

106. There is an audience of seven frogs, listening to a
speaker, or croaker, in the middle; and Bewick has set himself
to show in all, but especially in the speaker, essential
frogginess of mind&mdash;the marsh temper. He could not have
done it half so well in painting as he has done by the abstraction
of wood-outline. The characteristic of a manly mind,
or body, is to be gentle in temper, and firm in constitution;
the contrary essence of a froggy mind and body is to be
angular in temper, and flabby in constitution. I have
enlarged Bewick's orator-frog for you, Plate I. c., and I
think you will feel that he is entirely expressed in those
essential particulars.

This being perfectly good wood-cutting, notice especially
its deliberation. No scrawling or scratching, or cross-hatching,
or 'free' work of any sort. Most deliberate laying
down of solid lines and dots, of which you cannot change one.
The real difficulty of wood engraving is to cut every one of
these black lines or spaces of the exactly right shape, and not
at all to cross-hatch them cleanly.

107. Next, examine the technical treatment of the pig,
above. I have purposely chosen this as an example of a white
object on dark ground, and the frog as a dark object on light
ground, to explain to you what I mean by saying that fine
engraving regards local color, but not light and shade. You
see both frog and pig are absolutely without light and shade.
The frog, indeed, casts a shadow; but his hind leg is as white
as his throat. In the pig you don't even know which way the
light falls. But you know at once that the pig is white, and
the frog brown or green.

108. There are, however, two pieces of chiaroscuro implied
in the treatment of the pig. It is assumed that his curly tail
would be light against the background&mdash;dark against his own
rump. This little piece of heraldic quartering is absolutely[Pg 59]
necessary to solidify him. He would have been a white
ghost of a pig, flat on the background, but for that alternative
tail, and the bits of dark behind the ears. Secondly:
Where the shade is necessary to suggest the position of his
ribs, it is given with graphic and chosen points of dark, as
few as possible; not for the sake of the shade at all, but of
the skin and bone.

109. That, then, being the law of refused chiaroscuro,
observe further the method of outline. We said that we
were to have thick lines in wood, if possible. Look what
thickness of black outline Bewick has left under our pig's
chin, and above his nose.

But that is not a line at all, you think?

No;&mdash;a modern engraver would have made it one, and
prided himself on getting it fine. Bewick leaves it actually
thicker than the snout, but puts all his ingenuity of touch to
vary the forms, and break the extremities of his white cuts,
so that the eye may be refreshed and relieved by new forms
at every turn. The group of white touches filling the space
between snout and ears might be a wreath of fine-weather
clouds, so studiously are they grouped and broken.

And nowhere, you see, does a single black line cross another.

Look back to Figure 4, page 54, and you will know, henceforward,
the difference between good and bad wood-cutting.

110. We have also, in the lower woodcut, a notable instance
of Bewick's power of abstraction. You will observe that one
of the chief characters of this frog, which makes him humorous,&mdash;next
to his vain endeavor to get some firmness into his
fore feet,&mdash;is his obstinately angular hump-back. And you
must feel, when you see it so marked, how important a
general character of a frog it is to have a hump-back,&mdash;not
at the shoulders, but the loins.

111. Here, then, is a case in which you will see the exact
function that anatomy should take in art.

All the most scientific anatomy in the world would never
have taught Bewick, much less you, how to draw a frog.

But when once you have drawn him, or looked at him, so[Pg 60]
as to know his points, it then becomes entirely interesting
to find out why he has a hump-back. So I went myself
yesterday to Professor Rolleston for a little anatomy, just
as I should have gone to Professor Phillips for a little
geology; and the Professor brought me a fine little active
frog; and we put him on the table, and made him jump all
over it, and then the Professor brought in a charming Squelette
of a frog, and showed me that he needed a projecting
bone from his rump, as a bird needs it from its breast,&mdash;the
one to attach the strong muscles of the hind legs, as the other
to attach those of the fore legs or wings. So that the entire
leaping power of the frog is in his hump-back, as the flying
power of the bird is in its breast-bone. And thus this Frog
Parliament is most literally a Rump Parliament&mdash;everything
depending on the hind legs, and nothing on the
brains; which makes it wonderfully like some other Parliaments
we know of nowadays, with Mr. Ayrton and Mr. Lowe
for their &aelig;sthetic and acquisitive eyes, and a rump of Railway
Directors.

112. Now, to conclude, for want of time only&mdash;I have but
touched on the beginning of my subject,&mdash;understand clearly
and finally this simple principle of all art, that the best is that
which realizes absolutely, if possible. Here is a viper by Carpaccio:
you are afraid to go near it. Here is an arm-chair by
Carpaccio: you who came in late, and are standing, to my regret,
would like to sit down in it. This is consummate art;
but you can only have that with consummate means, and
exquisitely trained and hereditary mental power.

With inferior means, and average mental power, you must
be content to give a rude abstraction; but if rude abstraction
is to be made, think what a difference there must be between
a wise man's and a fool's; and consider what heavy responsibility
lies upon you in your youth, to determine, among realities,
by what you will be delighted, and, among imaginations,
by whose you will be led.

LECTURE IV.

THE TECHNICS OF METAL ENGRAVING.


113. We are to-day to examine the proper methods for the
technical management of the most perfect of the arms of precision
possessed by the artist. For you will at once understand
that a line cut by a finely-pointed instrument upon the
smooth surface of metal is susceptible of the utmost fineness
that can be given to the definite work of the human hand. In
drawing with pen upon paper, the surface of the paper is
slightly rough; necessarily, two points touch it instead of one,
and the liquid flows from them more or less irregularly, whatever
the draughtsman's skill. But you cut a metallic surface
with one edge only; the furrow drawn by a skater on the surface
of ice is like it on a large scale. Your surface is polished,
and your line may be wholly faultless, if your hand is.

114. And because, in such material, effects may be produced
which no penmanship could rival, most people, I fancy,
think that a steel plate half engraves itself; that the workman
has no trouble with it, compared to that of a pen draughtsman.

To test your feeling in this matter accurately, here is a
manuscript book written with pen and ink, and illustrated
with flourishes and vignettes.

You will all, I think, be disposed, on examining it, to exclaim,
How wonderful! and even to doubt the possibility of
every page in the book being completed in the same manner.
Again, here are three of my own drawings, executed with the
pen, and Indian ink, when I was fifteen. They are copies
from large lithographs by Prout; and I imagine that most of
my pupils would think me very tyrannical if I requested[Pg 62]
them to do anything of the kind themselves. And yet, when
you see in the shop windows a line engraving like this,[X] or
this,[X] either of which contains, alone, as much work as fifty
pages of the manuscript book, or fifty such drawings as mine,
you look upon its effect as quite a matter of course,&mdash;you
never say 'how wonderful' that is, nor consider how you
would like to have to live, by producing anything of the same
kind yourselves.




II.
The Star of FLORENCE.


115. Yet you cannot suppose it is in reality easier to draw
a line with a cutting point, not seeing the effect at all, or, if
any effect, seeing a gleam of light instead of darkness, than
to draw your black line at once on the white paper? You
cannot really think[Y] that there is something complacent, sympathetic,
and helpful in the nature of steel; so that while a
pen-and-ink sketch may always be considered an achievement
proving cleverness in the sketcher, a sketch on steel comes out
by mere favor of the indulgent metal; or that the plate is
woven like a piece of pattern silk, and the pattern is developed
by pasteboard cards punched full of holes? Not so. Look
close at this engraving, or take a smaller and simpler one,
Turner's Mercury and Argus,&mdash;imagine it to be a drawing in
pen and ink, and yourself required similarly to produce its
parallel! True, the steel point has the one advantage of not
blotting, but it has tenfold or twentyfold disadvantage, in that
you cannot slur, nor efface, except in a very resolute and laborious
way, nor play with it, nor even see what you are doing
with it at the moment, far less the effect that is to be. You
must feel what you are doing with it, and know precisely what
you have got to do; how deep, how broad, how far apart your
lines must be, etc. and etc., (a couple of lines of etceteras
would not be enough to imply all you must know). But sup[Pg 63]pose
the plate were only a pen drawing: take your pen&mdash;your
finest&mdash;and just try to copy the leaves that entangle the head
of Io, and her head itself; remembering always that the kind
of work required here is mere child's play compared to that
of fine figure engraving. Nevertheless, take a small magnifying
glass to this&mdash;count the dots and lines that gradate the
nostrils and the edges of the facial bone; notice how the light
is left on the top of the head by the stopping, at its outline,
of the coarse touches which form the shadows under the
leaves; examine it well, and then&mdash;I humbly ask of you&mdash;try
to do a piece of it yourself! You clever sketcher&mdash;you
young lady or gentleman of genius&mdash;you eye-glassed dilettante&mdash;you
current writer of criticism royally plural,&mdash;I beseech
you,&mdash;do it yourself; do the merely etched outline yourself,
if no more. Look you,&mdash;you hold your etching needle
this way, as you would a pencil, nearly; and then,&mdash;you
scratch with it! it is as easy as lying. Or if you think that
too difficult, take an easier piece;&mdash;take either of the light
sprays of foliage that rise against the fortress on the right,
pass your lens over them&mdash;look how their fine outline is first
drawn, leaf by leaf; then how the distant rock is put in between,
with broken lines, mostly stopping before they touch
the leaf-outline; and again, I pray you, do it yourself,&mdash;if
not on that scale, on a larger. Go on into the hollows of the
distant rock,&mdash;traverse its thickets,&mdash;number its towers;&mdash;count
how many lines there are in a laurel bush&mdash;in an arch&mdash;in
a casement; some hundred and fifty, or two hundred, deliberately
drawn lines, you will find, in every square quarter
of an inch;&mdash;say three thousand to the inch,&mdash;each, with
skillful intent, put in its place! and then consider what the
ordinary sketcher's work must appear, to the men who have
been trained to this!

116. "But might not more have been done by three thousand
lines to a square inch?" you will perhaps ask. Well,
possibly. It may be with lines as with soldiers: three hundred,
knowing their work thoroughly, may be stronger than
three thousand less sure of their aim. We shall have to press[Pg 64]
close home this question about numbers and purpose presently;&mdash;it
is not the question now. Suppose certain results
required,&mdash;atmospheric effects, surface textures, transparencies
of shade, confusions of light,&mdash;then, more could not be
done with less. There are engravings of this modern school,
of which, with respect to their particular aim, it may be said,
most truly, they "cannot be better done."

Here is one just finished,&mdash;or, at least, finished to the eyes
of ordinary mortals, though its fastidious master means to
retouch it;&mdash;a quite pure line engraving, by Mr. Charles
Henry Jeens; (in calling it pure line, I mean that there
are no mixtures of mezzotint or any mechanical tooling,
but all is steady hand-work,) from a picture by Mr. Armytage,
which, without possessing any of the highest claims to
admiration, is yet free from the vulgar vices which disgrace
most of our popular religious art; and is so sweet in the fancy
of it as to deserve, better than many works of higher power,
the pains of the engraver to make it a common possession. It
is meant to help us to imagine the evening of the day when
the father and mother of Christ had been seeking Him
through Jerusalem: they have come to a well where women
are drawing water; St. Joseph passes on,&mdash;but the tired Madonna,
leaning on the well's margin, asks wistfully of the
women if they have seen such and such a child astray. Now
will you just look for a while into the lines by which the expression
of the weary and anxious face is rendered; see how
unerring they are,&mdash;how calm and clear; and think how many
questions have to be determined in drawing the most minute
portion of any one,&mdash;its curve,&mdash;its thickness,&mdash;its distance
from the next,&mdash;its own preparation for ending, invisibly,
where it ends. Think what the precision must be in these
that trace the edge of the lip, and make it look quivering with
disappointment, or in these which have made the eyelash
heavy with restrained tears.

117. Or if, as must be the case with many of my audience,
it is impossible for you to conceive the difficulties here overcome,
look merely at the draperies, and other varied sub[Pg 65]stances
represented in the plate; see how silk, and linen, and
stone, and pottery, and flesh, are all separated in texture, and
gradated in light, by the most subtle artifices and appliances
of line,&mdash;of which artifices, and the nature of the mechanical
labor throughout, I must endeavor to give you to-day a more
distinct conception than you are in the habit of forming.
But as I shall have to blame some of these methods in their
general result, and I do not wish any word of general blame
to be associated with this most excellent and careful plate by
Mr. Jeens, I will pass, for special examination, to one already
in your reference series, which for the rest exhibits
more various treatment in its combined landscape, background,
and figures; the Belle Jardini&egrave;re of Raphael, drawn
and engraved by the Baron Desnoyers.

You see, in the first place, that the ground, stones, and
other coarse surfaces are distinguished from the flesh and
draperies by broken and wriggled lines. Those broken lines
cannot be executed with the burin, they are etched in the
early states of the plate, and are a modern artifice, never used
by old engravers; partly because the older men were not masters
of the art of etching, but chiefly because even those who
were acquainted with it would not employ lines of this nature.
They have been developed by the importance of landscape
in modern engraving, and have produced some valuable
results in small plates, especially of architecture. But they
are entirely erroneous in principle, for the surface of stones
and leaves is not broken or jagged in this manner, but consists
of mossy, or blooming, or otherwise organic texture, which
cannot be represented by these coarse lines; their general consequence
has therefore been to withdraw the mind of the observer
from all beautiful and tender characters in foreground,
and eventually to destroy the very school of landscape engraving
which gave birth to them.

Considered, however, as a means of relieving more delicate
textures, they are in some degree legitimate, being, in
fact, a kind of chasing or jagging one part of the plate surface
in order to throw out the delicate tints from the rough field.[Pg 66]
But the same effect was produced with less pains, and far
more entertainment to the eye, by the older engravers, who
employed purely ornamental variations of line; thus in Plate
IV., opposite &sect; 137, the drapery is sufficiently distinguished
from the grass by the treatment of the latter as an ornamental
arabesque. The grain of wood is elaborately engraved by
Marc Antonio, with the same purpose, in the plate given in
your Standard Series.

118. Next, however, you observe what difference of texture
and force exists between the smooth, continuous lines themselves,
which are all really engraved. You must take some
pains to understand the nature of this operation.

The line is first cut lightly through its whole course, by
absolute decision and steadiness of hand, which you may
endeavor to imitate if you like, in its simplest phase, by
drawing a circle with your compass-pen; and then, grasping
your penholder so that you can push the point like a plow,
describing other circles inside or outside of it, in exact
parallelism with the mathematical line, and at exactly equal
distances. To approach, or depart, with your point at finely
gradated intervals, may be your next exercise, if you find
the first unexpectedly easy.

119. When the line is thus described in its proper course,
it is plowed deeper, where depth is needed, by a second
cut of the burin, first on one side, then on the other, the cut
being given with gradated force so as to take away most steel
where the line is to be darkest. Every line of gradated depth
in the plate has to be thus cut eight or ten times over at
least, with retouchings to smooth and clear all in the close.
Jason has to plow his field ten-furrow deep, with his fiery
oxen well in hand, all the while.

When the essential lines are thus produced in their several
directions, those which have been drawn across each other,
so as to give depth of shade, or richness of texture, have
to be farther enriched by dots in the interstices; else there
would be a painful appearance of network everywhere; and
these dots require each four or five jags to produce them; and[Pg 67]
each of these jags must be done with what artists and engravers
alike call 'feeling,'&mdash;the sensibility, that is, of a hand
completely under mental government. So wrought, the dots
look soft, and like touches of paint; but mechanically dug
in, they are vulgar and hard.

120. Now, observe, that, for every piece of shadow throughout
the work, the engraver has to decide with what quantity
and kind of line he will produce it. Exactly the same
quantity of black, and therefore the same depth of tint in
general effect, may be given with six thick lines; or with
twelve, of half their thickness; or with eighteen, of a third
of the thickness. The second six, second twelve, or second
eighteen, may cross the first six, first twelve, or first eighteen,
or go between them; and they may cross at any angle. And
then the third six may be put between the first six, or
between the second six, or across both, and at any angle. In
the network thus produced, any kind of dots may be put in
the severally shaped interstices. And for any of the series
of superadded lines, dots, of equivalent value in shade, may
be substituted. (Some engravings are wrought in dots
altogether.) Choice infinite, with multiplication of infinity,
is, at all events, to be made, for every minute space, from one
side of the plate to the other.

121. The excellence of a beautiful engraving is primarily
in the use of these resources to exhibit the qualities of the
original picture, with delight to the eye in the method of translation;
and the language of engraving, when once you begin
to understand it, is, in these respects, so fertile, so ingenious,
so ineffably subtle and severe in its grammar, that you may
quite easily make it the subject of your life's investigation,
as you would the scholarship of a lovely literature.

But in doing this, you would withdraw, and necessarily
withdraw, your attention from the higher qualities of art, precisely
as a grammarian, who is that, and nothing more, loses
command of the matter and substance of thought. And the
exquisitely mysterious mechanisms of the engraver's method
have, in fact, thus entangled the intelligence of the careful[Pg 68]
draughtsmen of Europe; so that since the final perfection of
this translator's power, all the men of finest patience and
finest hand have stayed content with it;&mdash;the subtlest
draughtsmanship has perished from the canvas,[Z] and sought
more popular praise in this labyrinth of disciplined language,
and more or less dulled or degraded thought. And,
in sum, I know no cause more direct or fatal, in the destruction
of the great schools of European art, than the perfectness
of modern line engraving.

122. This great and profoundly to be regretted influence I
will prove and illustrate to you on another occasion. My
object to-day is to explain the perfectness of the art itself;
and above all to request you, if you will not look at pictures
instead of photographs, at least not to allow the cheap merits
of the chemical operation to withdraw your interest from the
splendid human labor of the engraver. Here is a little
vignette from Stothard, for instance, in Rogers' poems, to
the lines,


"Soared in the swing, half pleased and half afraid,
'Neath sister elms, that waved their summer shade."


You would think, would you not? (and rightly,) that of all
difficult things to express with crossed black lines and dots,
the face of a young girl must be the most difficult. Yet here
you have the face of a bright girl, radiant in light, transparent,
mysterious, almost breathing,&mdash;her dark hair involved
in delicate wreath and shade, her eyes full of joy and sweet
playfulness,&mdash;and all this done by the exquisite order and
gradation of a very few lines, which, if you will examine
them through a lens, you find dividing and checkering the
lip, and cheek, and chin, so strongly that you would have
fancied they could only produce the effect of a grim iron
mask. But the intelligences of order and form guide them
into beauty, and inflame them with delicatest life.[Pg 69]

123. And do you see the size of this head? About as
large as the bud of a forget-me-not! Can you imagine the
fineness of the little pressures of the hand on the steel, in that
space, which at the edge of the almost invisible lip, fashioned
its less or more of smile?

My chemical friends, if you wish ever to know anything
rightly concerning the arts, I very urgently advise you to
throw all your vials and washes down the gutter-trap; and
if you will ascribe, as you think it so clever to do, in your
modern creeds, all virtue to the sun, use that virtue through
your own heads and fingers, and apply your solar energies
to draw a skillful line or two, for once or twice in your life.
You may learn more by trying to engrave, like Goodall, the
tip of an ear, or the curl of a lock of hair, than by photographing
the entire population of the United States of America,&mdash;black,
white, and neutral-tint.

And one word, by the way, touching the complaints I
hear at my having set you to so fine work that it hurts your
eyes. You have noticed that all great sculptors&mdash;and most of
the great painters of Florence&mdash;began by being goldsmiths.
Why do you think the goldsmith's apprenticeship is so fruitful?
Primarily, because it forces the boy to do small work,
and mind what he is about. Do you suppose Michael Angelo
learned his business by dashing or hitting at it? He laid
the foundation of all his after power by doing precisely what
I am requiring my own pupils to do,&mdash;copying German
engravings in facsimile! And for your eyes&mdash;you all sit up
at night till you haven't got any eyes worth speaking of. Go
to bed at half-past nine, and get up at four, and you'll see
something out of them, in time.

124. Nevertheless, whatever admiration you may be
brought to feel, and with justice, for this lovely workmanship,&mdash;the
more distinctly you comprehend its merits, the more
distinctly also will the question rise in your mind, How is
it that a performance so marvelous has yet taken no rank
in the records of art of any permanent or acknowledged kind?[Pg 70]
How is it that these vignettes from Stothard and Turner,[AA]
like the woodcuts from Tenniel, scarcely make the name of
the engraver known; and that they never are found side by
side with this older and apparently ruder art, in the cabinets
of men of real judgment? The reason is precisely the same
as in the case of the Tenniel woodcut. This modern line
engraving is alloyed gold. Rich in capacity, astonishing in
attainment, it nevertheless admits willful fault, and misses
what it ought first to have attained. It is therefore, to
a certain measure, vile in its perfection; while the older work
is noble even in its failure, and classic no less in what it
deliberately refuses, than in what it rationally and rightly
prefers and performs.

125. Here, for instance, I have enlarged the head of one
of D&uuml;rer's Madonnas for you out of one of his most careful
plates.[AB] You think it very ugly. Well, so it is. Don't be
afraid to think so, nor to say so. Frightfully ugly; vulgar
also. It is the head, simply, of a fat Dutch girl, with all the
pleasantness left out. There is not the least doubt about
that. Don't let anybody force Albert D&uuml;rer down your
throats; nor make you expect pretty things from him.
Stothard's young girl in the swing, or Sir Joshua's Age of
Innocence, is in quite angelic sphere of another world, compared
to this black domain of poor, laborious Albert. We
are not talking of female beauty, so please you, just now,
gentlemen, but of engraving. And the merit, the classical,[Pg 71]
indefeasible, immortal merit of this head of a Dutch girl
with all the beauty left out, is in the fact that every line of
it, as engraving, is as good as can be;&mdash;good, not with the
mechanical dexterity of a watch-maker, but with the intellectual
effort and sensitiveness of an artist who knows precisely
what can be done, and ought to be attempted, with his
assigned materials. He works easily, fearlessly, flexibly; the
dots are not all measured in distance; the lines not all mathematically
parallel or divergent. He has even missed his mark
at the mouth in one place, and leaves the mistake, frankly.
But there are no petrified mistakes; nor is the eye so accustomed
to the look of the mechanical furrow as to accept it
for final excellence. The engraving is full of the painter's
higher power and wider perception; it is classically perfect,
because duly subordinate, and presenting for your applause
only the virtues proper to its own sphere. Among these, I
must now reiterate, the first of all is the decorative arrangement
of lines.

126. You all know what a pretty thing a damask tablecloth
is, and how a pattern is brought out by threads running
one way in one space, and across in another. So, in lace, a
certain delightfulness is given by the texture of meshed lines.

Similarly, on any surface of metal, the object of the
engraver is, or ought to be, to cover it with lovely lines, forming
a lace-work, and including a variety of spaces, delicious
to the eye.

And this is his business, primarily; before any other
matter can be thought of, his work must be ornamental. You
know I told you a sculptor's business is first to cover a surface
with pleasant bosses, whether they mean anything or not; so
an engraver's is to cover it with pleasant lines, whether they
mean anything or not. That they should mean something,
and a good deal of something, is indeed desirable afterwards;
but first we must be ornamental.

127. Now if you will compare Plate II. at the beginning
of this lecture, which is a characteristic example of good
Florentine engraving, and represents the Planet and power[Pg 72]
of Aphrodite, with the Aphrodite of Bewick in the upper
division of Plate I., you will at once understand the difference
between a primarily ornamental, and a primarily
realistic, style. The first requirement in the Florentine
work, is that it shall be a lovely arrangement of lines; a pretty
thing upon a page. Bewick has a secondary notion of making
his vignette a pretty thing upon a page. But he is overpowered
by his vigorous veracity, and bent first on giving
you his idea of Venus. Quite right, he would have been,
mind you, if he had been carving a statue of her on Mount
Eryx; but not when he was engraving a vignette to &AElig;sop's
fables. To engrave well is to ornament a surface well, not
to create a realistic impression. I beg your pardon for my
repetitions; but the point at issue is the root of the whole
business, and I must get it well asserted, and variously.

Let me pass to a more important example.

128. Three years ago, in the rough first arrangement of
the copies in the Educational Series, I put an outline of the
top of Apollo's scepter, which, in the catalogue, was said to
be probably by Baccio Bandini of Florence, for your first
real exercise; it remains so, the olive being put first only for
its mythological rank.

The series of engravings to which the plate from which
that exercise is copied belongs, are part of a number, executed
chiefly, I think, from early designs of Sandro Botticelli, and
some in great part by his hand. He and his assistant, Baccio,
worked together; and in such harmony, that Bandini probably
often does what Sandro wants, better than Sandro could
have done it himself; and, on the other hand, there is no
design of Bandini's over which Sandro does not seem to have
had influence.

And wishing now to show you three examples of the finest
work of the old, the renaissance, and the modern schools,&mdash;of
the old, I will take Baccio Bandini's Astrologia, Plate
III., opposite. Of the renaissance, D&uuml;rer's Adam and Eve.
And of the modern, this head of the daughter of Herodias,
engraved from Luini by Beaugrand, which is as affection[Pg 73]ately
and sincerely wrought, though in the modern manner,
as any plate of the old schools.





III.
"At ev'ning from the top of F&eacute;sole."


129. Now observe the progress of the feeling for light
and shade in the three examples.

The first is nearly all white paper; you think of the outline
as the constructive element throughout.

The second is a vigorous piece of white and black&mdash;not of
light and shade,&mdash;for all the high lights are equally white,
whether of flesh, or leaves, or goat's hair.

The third is complete in chiaroscuro, as far as engraving
can be.

Now the dignity and virtue of the plates is in the exactly
inverse ratio of their fullness in chiaroscuro.

Bandini's is excellent work, and of the very highest school.
D&uuml;rer's entirely accomplished work, but of an inferior school.
And Beaugrand's, excellent work, but of a vulgar and non-classical
school.

And these relations of the schools are to be determined by
the quality in the lines; we shall find that in proportion as
the light and shade is neglected, the lines are studied; that
those of Bandini are perfect; of D&uuml;rer perfect, only with a
lower perfection; but of Beaugrand, entirely faultful.

130. I have just explained to you that in modern engraving
the lines are cut in clean furrow, widened, it may be, by
successive cuts; but, whether it be fine or thick, retaining
always, when printed, the aspect of a continuous line drawn
with the pen, and entirely black throughout its whole course.

Now we may increase the delicacy of this line to any
extent by simply printing it in gray color instead of black.
I obtained some very beautiful results of this kind in the
later volumes of 'Modern Painters,' with Mr. Armytage's
help, by using subdued purple tints; but, in any case, the
line thus engraved must be monotonous in its character, and
cannot be expressive of the finest qualities of form.

Accordingly, the old Florentine workmen constructed the
line itself, in important places, of successive minute touches,
so that it became a chain of delicate links which could be[Pg 74]
opened or closed at pleasure.[AC] If you will examine through a
lens the outline of the face of this Astrology, you will find
it is traced with an exquisite series of minute touches,
susceptible of accentuation or change absolutely at the
engraver's pleasure; and, in result, corresponding to the
finest conditions of a pencil line drawing by a consummate
master. In the fine plates of this period, you have thus the
united powers of the pen and pencil, and both absolutely
secure and multipliable.

131. I am a little proud of having independently discovered,
and had the patience to carry out, this Florentine
method of execution for myself, when I was a boy of thirteen.
My good drawing-master had given me some copies
calculated to teach me freedom of hand; the touches were
rapid and vigorous,&mdash;many of them in mechanically regular
zigzags, far beyond any capacity of mine to imitate in the
bold way in which they were done. But I was resolved to
have them, somehow; and actually facsimiled a considerable
portion of the drawing in the Florentine manner, with the
finest point I could cut to my pencil, taking a quarter of an
hour to forge out the likeness of one return in the zigzag
which my master carried down through twenty returns in
two seconds; and so successfully, that he did not detect my
artifice till I showed it him,&mdash;on which he forbade me ever
to do the like again. And it was only thirty years afterwards
that I found I had been quite right after all, and
working like Baccio Bandini! But the patience which
carried me through that early effort, served me well through
all the thirty years, and enabled me to analyze, and in a
measure imitate, the method of work employed by every
master; so that, whether you believe me or not at first, you[Pg 75]
will find what I tell you of their superiority, or inferiority,
to be true.

132. When lines are studied with this degree of care, you
may be sure the master will leave room enough for you to
see them and enjoy them, and not use any at random. All
the finest engravers, therefore, leave much white paper, and
use their entire power on the outlines.

133. Next to them come the men of the Renaissance
schools, headed by D&uuml;rer, who, less careful of the beauty and
refinement of the line, delight in its vigor, accuracy, and
complexity. And the essential difference between these men
and the moderns is that these central masters cut their line
for the most part with a single furrow, giving it depth by
force of hand or wrist, and retouching, not in the furrow
itself, but with others beside it.[AD] Such work can only be
done well on copper, and it can display all faculty of hand
or wrist, precision of eye, and accuracy of knowledge, which
a human creature can possess. But the dotted or hatched line
is not used in this central style, and the higher conditions of
beauty never thought of.

In the Astrology of Bandini,&mdash;and remember that the
Astrologia of the Florentine meant what we mean by Astronomy,
and much more,&mdash;he wishes you first to look at the
face: the lip half open, faltering in wonder; the amazed,
intense, dreaming gaze; the pure dignity of forehead, undisturbed
by terrestrial thought. None of these things could
be so much as attempted in D&uuml;rer's method; he can engrave
flowing hair, skin of animals, bark of trees, wreathings of
metal-work, with the free hand; also, with labored chiaroscuro,
or with sturdy line, he can reach expressions of sadness,
or gloom, or pain, or soldierly strength,&mdash;but pure
beauty,&mdash;never.

134. Lastly, you have the Modern school, deepening its
lines in successive cuts. The instant consequence of the
introduction of this method is the restriction of curvature;[Pg 76]
you cannot follow a complex curve again with precision
through its furrow. If you are a dextrous plowman, you
can drive your plow any number of times along the simple
curve. But you cannot repeat again exactly the motions
which cut a variable one.[AE] You may retouch it, energize
it, and deepen it in parts, but you cannot cut it all through
again equally. And the retouching and energizing in parts
is a living and intellectual process; but the cutting all through,
equally, a mechanical one. The difference is exactly such
as that between the dexterity of turning out two similar
moldings from a lathe, and carving them with the free
hand, like a Pisan sculptor. And although splendid intellect,
and subtlest sensibility, have been spent on the production
of some modern plates, the mechanical element introduced
by their manner of execution always overpowers both;
nor can any plate of consummate value ever be produced in
the modern method.

135. Nevertheless, in landscape, there are two examples
in your Reference series, of insuperable skill and extreme
beauty: Miller's plate, before instanced, of the Grand Canal,
Venice; and E. Goodall's of the upper fall of the Tees. The
men who engraved these plates might have been exquisite
artists; but their patience and enthusiasm were held captive
in the false system of lines, and we lost the painters; while
the engravings, wonderful as they are, are neither of them
worth a Turner etching, scratched in ten minutes with the
point of an old fork; and the common types of such elaborate
engraving are none of them worth a single frog, pig, or
puppy, out of the corner of a Bewick vignette.

136. And now, I think, you cannot fail to understand
clearly what you are to look for in engraving, as a separate
art from that of painting. Turn back to the 'Astrologia' as
a perfect type of the purest school. She is gazing at stars,
and crowned with them. But the stars are black instead of
shining! You cannot have a more decisive and absolute proof
that you must not look in engraving for chiaroscuro.[Pg 77]

Nevertheless, her body is half in shade, and her left foot;
and she casts a shadow, and there is a bar of shade behind
her.

All these are merely so much acceptance of shade as may
relieve the forms, and give value to the linear portions. The
face, though turned from the light, is shadowless.

Again. Every lock of the hair is designed and set in its
place with the subtlest care, but there is no luster attempted,&mdash;no
texture,&mdash;no mystery. The plumes of the wings are set
studiously in their places,&mdash;they, also, lusterless. That
even their filaments are not drawn, and that the broad curve
embracing them ignores the anatomy of a bird's wing, are
conditions of design, not execution. Of these in a future
lecture.[AF]





IV.
"By the Springs of Parnassus."


137. The 'Poesia,' Plate IV., opposite, is a still more
severe, though not so generic, an example; its decorative
foreground reducing it almost to the rank of goldsmith's
ornamentation. I need scarcely point out to you that the
flowing water shows neither luster nor reflection; but notice
that the observer's attention is supposed to be so close to
every dark touch of the graver that he will see the minute
dark spots which indicate the sprinkled shower falling from
the vase into the pool.

138. This habit of strict and calm attention, constant in
the artist, and expected in the observer, makes all the difference
between the art of Intellect, and of mere sensation. For
every detail of this plate has a meaning, if you care to
understand it. This is Poetry, sitting by the fountain of
Castalia, which flows first out of a formal urn, to show that
it is not artless; but the rocks of Parnassus are behind, and
on the top of them&mdash;only one tree, like a mushroom with a
thick stalk. You at first are inclined to say, How very
absurd, to put only one tree on Parnassus! but this one
tree is the Immortal Plane Tree, planted by Agamemnon,
and at once connects our Poesia with the Iliad. Then, this[Pg 78]
is the hem of the robe of Poetry,&mdash;this is the divine vegetation
which springs up under her feet,&mdash;this is the heaven and
earth united by her power,&mdash;this is the fountain of Castalia
flowing out afresh among the grass,&mdash;and these are the drops
with which, out of a pitcher, Poetry is nourishing the fountain
of Castalia.

All which you may find out if you happen to know anything
about Castalia, or about poetry; and pleasantly think
more upon, for yourself. But the poor dunces, Sandro and
Baccio, feeling themselves but 'goffi nell' arte,' have no
hope of telling you all this, except suggestively. They can't
engrave grass of Parnassus, nor sweet springs so as to look
like water; but they can make a pretty damasked surface
with ornamental leaves, and flowing lines, and so leave you
something to think of&mdash;if you will.

139. 'But a great many people won't, and a great many
more can't; and surely the finished engravings are much
more delightful, and the only means we have of giving any
idea of finished pictures, out of our reach.'

Yes, all that is true; and when we examine the effects of
line engraving upon taste in recent art, we will discuss these
matters; for the present, let us be content with knowing what
the best work is, and why it is so. Although, however, I do
not now press further my cavils at the triumph of modern line
engraving, I must assign to you, in few words, the reason of
its recent decline. Engravers complain that photography
and cheap wood-cutting have ended their finer craft. No
complaint can be less grounded. They themselves destroyed
their own craft, by vulgarizing it. Content in their beautiful
mechanism, they ceased to learn, and to feel, as artists;
they put themselves under the order of publishers and print-sellers;
they worked indiscriminately from whatever was put
into their hands,&mdash;from Bartlett as willingly as from Turner,
and from Mulready as carefully as from Raphael. They
filled the windows of print-sellers, the pages of gift books,
with elaborate rubbish, and piteous abortions of delicate
industry. They worked cheap, and cheaper,&mdash;smoothly, and[Pg 79]
more smoothly,&mdash;they got armies of assistants, and surrounded
themselves with schools of mechanical tricksters,
learning their stale tricks with blundering avidity. They
had fallen&mdash;before the days of photography&mdash;into providers
of frontispieces for housekeepers' pocket-books. I do not
know if photography itself, their redoubted enemy, has even
now ousted them from that last refuge.

140. Such the fault of the engraver,&mdash;very pardonable;
scarcely avoidable,&mdash;however fatal. Fault mainly of humility.
But what has your fault been, gentlemen? what the
patrons' fault, who have permitted so wide waste of admirable
labor, so pathetic a uselessness of obedient genius? It was
yours to have directed, yours to have raised and rejoiced in,
the skill, the modesty, the patience of this entirely gentle and
industrious race;&mdash;copyists with their heart. The common
painter-copyists who encumber our European galleries with
their easels and pots, are, almost without exception, persons
too stupid to be painters, and too lazy to be engravers. The
real copyists&mdash;the men who can put their soul into another's
work&mdash;are employed at home, in their narrow rooms, striving
to make their good work profitable to all men. And in their
submission to the public taste they are truly national servants
as much as Prime Ministers are. They fulfill the demand of
the nation; what, as a people, you wish to have for possession
in art, these men are ready to give you.

And what have you hitherto asked of them?&mdash;Ramsgate
Sands, and Dolly Vardens, and the Paddington Station,&mdash;these,
I think, are typical of your chief demands; the cartoons
of Raphael&mdash;which you don't care to see themselves;
and, by way of a flight into the empyrean, the Madonna di
San Sisto. And literally, there are hundreds of cities and
villages in Italy in which roof and wall are blazoned with
the noblest divinity and philosophy ever imagined by
men; and of all this treasure, I can, as far as I know, give
you not one example, in line engraving, by an English
hand!

Well, you are in the main matter right in this. You want[Pg 80]
essentially Ramsgate Sands and the Paddington Station, because
there you can see yourselves.

Make yourselves, then, worthy to be seen forever, and let
English engraving become noble as the record of English
loveliness and honor.

in its use of every possible artifice of delicate line, (note the
look of tremulous atmosphere got by the undulatory etched lines on
the pavement, and the broken masses, worked with dots, of the fountain
foam,) that I think it cannot but, with some of its companions,
survive the refuse of its school, and become classic. I find in like
manner, even with all their faults and weaknesses, the vignettes to
Heyne's Virgil to be real art-possessions.

LECTURE V.

DESIGN IN THE GERMAN SCHOOLS OF ENGRAVING.

141. By reference to the close of the preface to 'Eagle's
Nest,' you will see, gentlemen, that I meant these lectures,
from the first, rather to lead you to the study of the characters
of two great men, than to interest you in the processes of a
secondary form of art. As I draw my materials into the
limited form necessary for the hour, I find my divided purpose
doubly failing; and would fain rather use my time to-day
in supplying the defects of my last lecture, than in opening
the greater subject, which I must treat with still more
lamentable inadequacy. Nevertheless, you must not think it
is for want of time that I omit reference to other celebrated
engravers, and insist on the special power of these two only.
Many not inconsiderable reputations are founded merely on
the curiosity of collectors of prints, or on partial skill in the
management of processes; others, though resting on more secure
bases, are still of no importance to you in the general
history of art; whereas you will find the work of Holbein and
Botticelli determining for you, without need of any farther
range, the principal questions of moment in the relation of
the Northern and Southern schools of design. Nay, a wider
method of inquiry would only render your comparison less accurate
in result. It is only in Holbein's majestic range of
capacity, and only in the particular phase of Teutonic life
which his art adorned, that the problem can be dealt with on
fair terms. We Northerns can advance no fairly comparable
antagonist to the artists of the South, except at that one moment,
and in that one man. Rubens cannot for an instant
be matched with Tintoret, nor Memling with Lippi; while[Pg 82]
Reynolds only rivals Titian in what he learned from him.
But in Holbein and Botticelli we have two men trained independently,
equal in power of intellect, similar in material
and mode of work, contemporary in age, correspondent in
disposition. The relation between them is strictly typical of
the constant aspects to each other of the Northern and Southern
schools.

142. Their point of closest contact is in the art of engraving,
and this art is developed entirely as the servant of the
great passions which perturbed or polluted Europe in the fifteenth
century. The impulses which it obeys are all new;
and it obeys them with its own nascent plasticity of temper.
Painting and sculpture are only modified by them; but
engraving is educated.

These passions are in the main three; namely,

1. The thirst for classical literature, and the forms of
proud and false taste which arose out of it, in the position
it had assumed as the enemy of Christianity.

2. The pride of science, enforcing (in the particular domain
of Art) accuracy of perspective, shade, and anatomy,
never before dreamed of.

3. The sense of error and iniquity in the theological teaching
of the Christian Church, felt by the highest intellects
of the time, and necessarily rendering the formerly
submissive religious art impossible.

To-day, then, our task is to examine the peculiar characters
of the Design of the Northern Schools of Engraving, as
affected by these great influences.

143. I have not often, however, used the word 'design,'
and must clearly define the sense in which I now use it. It
is vaguely used in common art-parlance; often as if it meant
merely the drawing of a picture, as distinct from its color;
and in other still more inaccurate ways. The accurate and
proper sense, underlying all these, I must endeavor to make
clear to you.

'Design' properly signifies that power in any art-work
which has a purpose other than of imitation, and which is[Pg 83]
'designed,' composed, or separated to that end. It implies
the rejection of some things, and the insistence upon others,
with a given object.[AG]

Let us take progressive instances. Here is a group of
prettily dressed peasant children, charmingly painted by a
very able modern artist&mdash;not absolutely without design, for
he really wishes to show you how pretty peasant children can
be, (and, in so far, is wiser and kinder than Murillo, who
likes to show how ugly they can be); also, his group is agreeably
arranged, and its component children carefully chosen.
Nevertheless, any summer's day, near any country village,
you may come upon twenty groups in an hour as pretty as
this; and may see&mdash;if you have eyes&mdash;children in them
twenty times prettier than these. A photograph, if it could
render them perfectly, and in color, would far excel the charm
of this painting; for in it, good and clever as it is, there is
nothing supernatural, and much that is subnatural.

144. Beside this group of, in every sense of the word, 'artless'
little country girls, I will now set one&mdash;in the best
sense of the word&mdash;'artful' little country girl,&mdash;a sketch by
Gainsborough.

You never saw her like before. Never will again, now
that Gainsborough is dead. No photography,&mdash;no science,&mdash;[Pg 84]no
industry, will touch or reach for an instant this super-naturalness.
You will look vainly through the summer fields
for such a child. "Nor up the lawn, nor by the wood," is
she. Whence do you think this marvelous charm has come?
Alas! if we knew, would not we all be Gainsboroughs? This
only you may practically ascertain, as surely as that a flower
will die if you cut its root away, that you cannot alter a single
touch in Gainsborough's work without injury to the whole.
Half a dozen spots, more or less, in the printed gowns of
these other children whom I first showed you, will not make
the smallest difference to them; nor a lock or two more or less
in their hair, nor a dimple or two more or less in their cheeks.
But if you alter one wave of the hair of Gainsborough's girl,
the child is gone. Yet the art is so subtle, that I do not
expect you to believe this. It looks so instinctive, so easy, so
'chanceux,'&mdash;the French word is better than ours. Yes, and
in their more accurate sense, also, 'Il a de la chance.' A
stronger Designer than he was with him. He could not tell
you himself how the thing was done.

145. I proceed to take a more definite instance&mdash;this Greek
head of the Lacinian Juno. The design or appointing of the
forms now entirely prevails over the resemblance to Nature.
No real hair could ever be drifted into these wild lines, which
mean the wrath of the Adriatic winds round the Cape of
Storms.

And yet, whether this be uglier or prettier than Gainsborough's
child&mdash;(and you know already what I think about it,
that no Greek goddess was ever half so pretty as an English
girl, of pure clay and temper,)&mdash;uglier or prettier, it is more
dignified and impressive. It at least belongs to the domain
of a lordlier, more majestic, more guiding and ordaining art.

146. I will go back another five hundred years, and place
an Egyptian beside the Greek divinity. The resemblance to
Nature is now all but lost, the ruling law has become all.
The lines are reduced to an easily counted number, and their
arrangement is little more than a decorative sequence of
pleasant curves cut in porphyry,&mdash;in the upper part of their[Pg 85]
contour following the outline of a woman's face in profile,
over-crested by that of a hawk, on a kind of pedestal. But
that the sign-engraver meant by his hawk, Immortality, and
by her pedestal, the House or Tavern of Truth, is of little
importance now to the passing traveler, not yet preparing to
take the sarcophagus for his place of rest.

147. How many questions are suggested to us by these
transitions! Is beauty contrary to law, and grace attainable
only through license? What we gain in language, shall we
lose in thought? and in what we add of labor, more and more
forget its ends?

Not so.

Look at this piece of Sandro's work, the Libyan Sibyl.[AH]

It is as ordered and normal as the Egyptian's&mdash;as graceful
and facile as Gainsborough's. It retains the majesty of old
religion; it is invested with the joy of newly awakened childhood.

Mind, I do not expect you&mdash;do not wish you&mdash;to enjoy
Botticelli's dark engraving as much as Gainsborough's aerial
sketch; for due comparison of the men, painting should be
put beside painting. But there is enough even in this copy
of the Florentine plate to show you the junction of the two
powers in it&mdash;of prophecy, and delight.

148. Will these two powers, do you suppose, be united in
the same manner in the contemporary Northern art? That
Northern school is my subject to-day; and yet I give you, as
type of the intermediate condition between Egypt and England&mdash;not
Holbein, but Botticelli. I am obliged to do this;
because in the Southern art, the religious temper remains
unconquered by the doctrines of the Reformation. Botticelli
was&mdash;what Luther wished to be, but could not be&mdash;a reformer
still believing in the Church: his mind is at peace; and his
art, therefore, can pursue the delight of beauty, and yet
remain prophetic. But it was far otherwise in Germany.
There the Reformation of manners became the destruction of
faith; and art therefore, not a prophecy, but a protest. It is[Pg 86]
the chief work of the greatest Protestant who ever lived,[AI]
which I ask you to study with me to-day.

149. I said that the power of engraving had developed
itself during the introduction of three new&mdash;(practically and
vitally new, that is to say)&mdash;elements, into the minds of men:
elements which briefly may be expressed thus:


Classicism, and Literary Science.
Medicine, and Physical Science.[AJ]
Reformation, and Religious Science.


And first of Classicism.

You feel, do not you, in this typical work of Gainsborough's,
that his subject as well as his picture is 'artless' in
a lovely sense;&mdash;nay, not only artless, but ignorant, and unscientific,
in a beautiful way? You would be afterwards remorseful,
I think, and angry with yourself&mdash;seeing the effect
produced on her face&mdash;if you were to ask this little lady to
spell a very long word? Also, if you wished to know how
many times the sevens go in forty-nine, you would perhaps
wisely address yourself elsewhere. On the other hand, you
do not doubt that this lady[AK] knows very well how many times
the sevens go in forty-nine, and is more Mistress of Arts than
any of us are Masters of them.

150. You have then, in the one case, a beautiful simplicity,
and a blameless ignorance; in the other, a beautiful artfulness,
and a wisdom which you do not dread,&mdash;or, at least,
even though dreading, love. But you know also that we may[Pg 87]
remain in a hateful and culpable ignorance; and, as I fear too
many of us in competitive effort feel, become possessed of a
hateful knowledge.

Ignorance, therefore, is not evil absolutely; but, innocent,
may be lovable.

Knowledge also is not good absolutely; but, guilty, may be
hateful.

So, therefore, when I now repeat my former statement,
that the first main opposition between the Northern and
Southern schools is in the simplicity of the one, and the
scholarship of the other, that statement may imply sometimes
the superiority of the North, and sometimes of the South.
You may have a heavenly simplicity opposed to a hellish
(that is to say, a lustful and arrogant) scholarship; or you
may have a barbarous and presumptuous ignorance opposed
to a divine and disciplined wisdom. Ignorance opposed to
learning in both cases; but evil to good, as the case may be.

151. For instance: the last time I was standing before
Raphael's arabesques in the Loggias of the Vatican, I wrote
down in my pocket-book the description, or, more modestly
speaking, the inventory, of the small portion of that infinite
wilderness of sensual fantasy which happened to be opposite
me. It consisted of a woman's face, with serpents for hair,
and a virgin's breasts, with stumps for arms, ending in blue
butterflies' wings, the whole changing at the waist into a goat's
body, which ended below in an obelisk upside-down, to the
apex at the bottom of which were appended, by graceful
chains, an altar, and two bunches of grapes.

Now you know in a moment, by a glance at this 'design'&mdash;beautifully
struck with free hand, and richly gradated in
color,&mdash;that the master was familiar with a vast range of art
and literature: that he knew all about Egyptian sphinxes, and
Greek Gorgons; about Egyptian obelisks, and Hebrew altars;
about Hermes, and Venus, and Bacchus, and satyrs, and
goats, and grapes.

You know also&mdash;or ought to know, in an instant,&mdash;that all
this learning has done him no good; that he had better have[Pg 88]
known nothing than any of these things, since they were to
be used by him only to such purpose; and that his delight in
armless breasts, legless trunks, and obelisks upside-down, has
been the last effort of his expiring sensation, in the grasp of
corrupt and altogether victorious Death. And you have thus,
in Gainsborough as compared with Raphael, a sweet, sacred,
and living simplicity, set against an impure, profane, and
paralyzed knowledge.

152. But, next, let us consider the reverse conditions.

Let us take instance of contrast between faultful and
treacherous ignorance, and divinely pure and fruitful knowledge.

In the place of honor at the end of one of the rooms of your
Royal Academy&mdash;years ago&mdash;stood a picture by an English
Academician, announced as a representation of Moses sustained
by Aaron and Hur, during the discomfiture of Amalek.
In the entire range of the Pentateuch, there is no other scene
(in which the visible agents are mortal only) requiring so
much knowledge and thought to reach even a distant approximation
to the probabilities of the fact. One saw in a moment
that the painter was both powerful and simple, after a
sort; that he had really sought for a vital conception, and had
originally and earnestly read his text, and formed his conception.
And one saw also in a moment that he had chanced
upon this subject, in reading or hearing his Bible, as he might
have chanced on a dramatic scene accidentally in the street.
That he knew nothing of the character of Moses,&mdash;nothing of
his law,&mdash;nothing of the character of Aaron, nor of the nature
of a priesthood,&mdash;nothing of the meaning of the event which
he was endeavoring to represent, of the temper in which it
would have been transacted by its agents, or of its relations to
modern life.

153. On the contrary, in the fresco of the earlier scenes in
the life of Moses, by Sandro Botticelli, you know&mdash;not 'in a
moment,' for the knowledge of knowledge cannot be so obtained;
but in proportion to the discretion of your own reading,
and to the care you give to the picture, you may know,[Pg 89]&mdash;that
here is a sacredly guided and guarded learning; here a
Master indeed, at whose feet you may sit safely, who can teach
you, better than in words, the significance of both Moses' law
and Aaron's ministry; and not only these, but, if he chose,
could add to this an exposition as complete of the highest
philosophies both of the Greek nation, and of his own; and
could as easily have painted, had it been asked of him, Draco,
or Numa, or Justinian, as the herdsman of Jethro.

154. It is rarely that we can point to an opposition between
faultful, because insolent, ignorance, and virtuous, because
gracious, knowledge, so direct, and in so parallel elements, as
in this instance. In general, the analysis is much more complex.
It is intensely difficult to indicate the mischief of
involuntary and modest ignorance, calamitous only in a measure;
fruitful in its lower field, yet sorrowfully condemned
to that lower field&mdash;not by sin, but fate.

When first I introduced you to Bewick, we closed our too
partial estimate of his entirely magnificent powers with one
sorrowful concession&mdash;he could draw a pig, but not a Venus.

Eminently he could so, because&mdash;which is still more sorrowfully
to be conceded&mdash;he liked the pig best. I have put
now in your educational series a whole galaxy of pigs by him;
but, hunting all the fables through, I find only one Venus,
and I think you will all admit that she is an unsatisfactory
Venus.[AL] There is honest simplicity here; but you regret it;
you miss something that you find in Holbein, much more in
Botticelli. You see in a moment that this man knows nothing
of Sphinxes, or Muses, or Graces, or Aphrodites; and, besides,
that, knowing nothing, he would have no liking for
them even if he saw them; but much prefers the style of a
well-to-do English housekeeper with corkscrew curls, and a
portly person.

155. You miss something, I said, in Bewick which you
find in Holbein. But do you suppose Holbein himself, or
any other Northern painter, could wholly quit himself of the
like accusations? I told you, in the second of these lectures,[Pg 90]
that the Northern temper, refined from savageness, and
the Southern, redeemed from decay, met, in Florence. Holbein
and Botticelli are the purest types of the two races.
Holbein is a civilized boor; Botticelli a reanimate Greek.
Holbein was polished by companionship with scholars and
kings, but remains always a burgher of Augsburg in essential
nature. Bewick and he are alike in temper; only the one is
untaught, the other perfectly taught. But Botticelli needs no
teaching. He is, by his birth, scholar and gentleman to the
heart's core. Christianity itself can only inspire him, not
refine him. He is as tried gold chased by the jeweler,&mdash;the
roughest part of him is the outside.

Now how differently must the newly recovered scholastic
learning tell upon these two men. It is all out of Holbein's
way; foreign to his nature, useless at the best, probably cumbrous.
But Botticelli receives it as a child in later years
recovers the forgotten dearness of a nursery tale; and is more
himself, and again and again himself, as he breathes the air
of Greece, and hears, in his own Italy, the lost voice of the
Sibyl murmur again by the Avernus Lake.

156. It is not, as we have seen, every one of the Southern
race who can thus receive it. But it graces them all; is at
once a part of their being; destroys them, if it is to destroy,
the more utterly because it so enters into their natures. It
destroys Raphael; but it graces him, and is a part of him. It
all but destroys Mantegna; but it graces him. And it does
not hurt Holbein, just because it does not grace him&mdash;never
is for an instant a part of him. It is with Raphael as with
some charming young girl who has a new and beautifully
made dress brought to her, which entirely becomes her,&mdash;so
much, that in a little while, thinking of nothing else, she becomes
it; and is only the decoration of her dress. But with
Holbein it is as if you brought the same dress to a stout farmer's
daughter who was going to dine at the Hall; and begged
her to put it on that she might not discredit the company.
She puts it on to please you; looks entirely ridiculous in it,
but is not spoiled by it,&mdash;remains herself, in spite of it.[Pg 91]

157. You probably have never noticed the extreme awkwardness
of Holbein in wearing this new dress; you would
the less do so because his own people think him all the finer
for it, as the farmer's wife would probably think her daughter.
Dr. Woltmann, for instance, is enthusiastic in praise of
the splendid architecture in the background of his Annunciation.
A fine mess it must have made in the minds of simple
German maidens, in their notion of the Virgin at home! I
cannot show you this Annunciation; but I have under my
hand one of Holbein's Bible cuts, of the deepest seriousness
and import&mdash;his illustration of the Canticles, showing the
Church as the bride of Christ.





You could not find a subject requiring more tenderness,
purity, or dignity of treatment. In this maid, symbolizing
the Church, you ask for the most passionate humility, the
most angelic beauty: "Behold, thou art fair, my dove."
Now here is Holbein's ideal of that fairness; here is his
"Church as the Bride."

I am sorry to associate this figure in your minds, even for
a moment, with the passages it is supposed to illustrate; but
the lesson is too important to be omitted. Remember, Hol[Pg 92]bein
represents the temper of Northern Reformation. He
has all the nobleness of that temper, but also all its baseness.
He represents, indeed, the revolt of German truth against
Italian lies; but he represents also the revolt of German
animalism against Hebrew imagination. This figure of
Holbein's is half-way from Solomon's mystic bride, to
Rembrandt's wife, sitting on his knee while he drinks.

But the key of the question is not in this. Florentine animalism
has at this time, also, enough to say for itself. But
Florentine animalism, at this time, feels the joy of a gentleman,
not of a churl. And a Florentine, whatever he does,&mdash;be
it virtuous or sinful, chaste or lascivious, severe or extravagant,&mdash;does
it with a grace.

158. You think, perhaps, that Holbein's Solomon's bride
is so ungraceful chiefly because she is overdressed, and has
too many feathers and jewels. No; a Florentine would have
put any quantity of feathers and jewels on her, and yet never
lost her grace. You shall see him do it, and that to a fantastic
degree, for I have an example under my hand. Look
back, first, to Bewick's Venus (Lecture III.). You can't
accuse her of being overdressed. She complies with every
received modern principle of taste. Sir Joshua's precept that
drapery should be "drapery, and nothing more," is observed
more strictly even by Bewick than by Michael Angelo. If
the absence of decoration could exalt the beauty of his Venus,
here had been her perfection.

Now look back to Plate II. (Lecture IV.), by Sandro;
Venus in her planet, the ruling star of Florence. Anything
more grotesque in conception, more unrestrained in fancy of
ornament, you cannot find, even in the final days of the Renaissance.
Yet Venus holds her divinity through all; she
will become majestic to you as you gaze; and there is not a
line of her chariot wheels, of her buskins, or of her throne,
which you may not see was engraved by a gentleman.





V.
"Heat considered as a Mode of Motion."
Florentine Natural Philosophy.



159. Again, Plate V., opposite, is a facsimile of another
engraving of the same series&mdash;the Sun in Leo. It is even
more extravagant in accessories than the Venus. You see[Pg 93]
the Sun's epaulets before you see the sun; the spiral scrolls
of his chariot, and the black twisted rays of it, might, so far
as types of form only are considered, be a design for some
modern court-dress star, to be made in diamonds. And yet
all this wild ornamentation is, if you will examine it, more
purely Greek in spirit than the Apollo Belvedere.

You know I have told you, again and again, that the soul
of Greece is her veracity; that what to other nations were
fables and symbolisms, to her became living facts&mdash;living
gods. The fall of Greece was instant when her gods again
became fables. The Apollo Belvedere is the work of a sculptor
to whom Apollonism is merely an elegant idea on which
to exhibit his own skill. He does not himself feel for an instant
that the handsome man in the unintelligible attitude,[AM]
with drapery hung over his left arm, as it would be hung to
dry over a clothes-line, is the Power of the Sun. But the
Florentine believes in Apollo with his whole mind, and is trying
to explain his strength in every touch.

For instance; I said just now, "You see the sun's epaulets
before the sun." Well, don't you, usually, as it rises?
Do you not continually mistake a luminous cloud for it, or
wonder where it is, behind one? Again, the face of the
Apollo Belvedere is agitated by anxiety, passion, and pride.
Is the sun's likely to be so, rising on the evil and the good?
This Prince sits crowned and calm: look at the quiet fingers
of the hand holding the scepter,&mdash;at the restraint of the reins
merely by a depression of the wrist.

160. You have to look carefully for those fingers holding
the scepter, because the hand&mdash;which a great anatomist would
have made so exclusively interesting&mdash;is here confused with
the ornamentation of the arm of the chariot on which it rests.[Pg 94]
But look what the ornamentation is;&mdash;fruit and leaves, abundant,
in the mouth of a cornucopia. A quite vulgar and
meaningless ornament in ordinary renaissance work. Is it
so here, think you? Are not the leaves and fruits of earth
in the Sun's hand?[AN]

You thought, perhaps, when I spoke just now of the action
of the right hand, that less than a depression of the wrist
would stop horses such as those. You fancy Botticelli drew
them so, because he had never seen a horse; or because, able
to draw fingers, he could not draw hoofs! How fine it would
be to have, instead, a prancing four-in-hand, in the style of
Piccadilly on the Derby-day, or at least horses like the real
Greek horses of the Parthenon!

Yes; and if they had had real ground to trot on, the Florentine
would have shown you he knew how they should trot.
But these have to make their way up the hill-side of other
lands. Look to the example in your standard series, Hermes
Eriophoros. You will find his motion among clouds represented
precisely in this laboring, failing, half-kneeling attitude
of limb. These forms, toiling up through the rippled
sands of heaven, are&mdash;not horses;&mdash;they are clouds themselves,
like horses, but only a little like. Look how their
hoofs lose themselves, buried in the ripples of cloud; it makes
one think of the quicksands of Morecambe Bay.

And their tails&mdash;what extraordinary tufts of tails, ending
in points! Yes; but do you not see, nearly joining with
them, what is not a horse tail at all; but a flame of fire, kindled
at Apollo's knee? All the rest of the radiance about him
shoots from him. But this is rendered up to him. As the
fruits of the earth are in one of his hands, its fire is in the
other. And all the warmth, as well as all the light of it, are
his.

We had a little natural philosophy, gentlemen, as well as
theology, in Florence, once upon a time.

161. Natural philosophy, and also natural art, for in this[Pg 95]
the Greek reanimate was a nobler creature than the Greek
who had died. His art had a wider force and warmer glow.
I have told you that the first Greeks were distinguished from
the barbarians by their simple humanity; the second Greeks&mdash;these
Florentine Greeks reanimate&mdash;are human more
strongly, more deeply, leaping from the Byzantine death at
the call of Christ, "Loose him, and let him go." And there
is upon them at once the joy of resurrection, and the solemnity
of the grave.





VI.
Fairness of the Sea and Air.
In VENICE and ATHENS.


162. Of this resurrection of the Greek, and the form of the
tomb he had been buried in "those four days," I have to give
you some account in the last lecture. I will only to-day show
you an illustration of it which brings us back to our immediate
question as to the reasons why Northern art could not
accept classicism. When, in the closing lecture of "Aratra
Pentelici,"[AO] I compared Florentine with Greek work, it was
to point out to you the eager passions of the first as opposed
to the formal legalism and proprieties of the other. Greek
work, I told you, while truthful, was also restrained, and
never but under majesty of law; while Gothic work was true,
in the perfect law of Liberty or Franchise. And now I give
you in facsimile (Plate VI.) the two Aphrodites thus compared&mdash;the
Aphrodite Thalassia of the Tyrrhene seas, and
the Aphrodite Urania of the Greek skies. You may not at
first like the Tuscan best; and why she is the best, though
both are noble, again I must defer explaining to next lecture.
But now turn back to Bewick's Venus, and compare her with
the Tuscan Venus of the Stars, (Plate II.); and then here,
in Plate VI., with the Tuscan Venus of the Seas, and the
Greek Venus of the Sky. Why is the English one vulgar?
What is it, in the three others, which makes them, if not beautiful,
at least refined?&mdash;every one of them 'designed' and
drawn, indisputably, by a gentleman?

I never have been so puzzled by any subject of analysis as,
for these ten years, I have been by this. Every answer I
give, however plausible it seems at first, fails in some way, or[Pg 96]
in some cases. But there is the point for you, more definitely
put, I think, than in any of my former books;&mdash;at present,
for want of time, I must leave it to your own thoughts.

163. II. The second influence under which engraving
developed itself, I said, was that of medicine and the physical
sciences. Gentlemen, the most audacious, and the most valuable,
statement which I have yet made to you on the subject
of practical art, in these rooms, is that of the evil resulting
from the study of anatomy. It is a statement so audacious,
that not only for some time I dared not make it to you, but
for ten years, at least, I dared not make it to myself. I saw,
indeed, that whoever studied anatomy was in a measure injured
by it; but I kept attributing the mischief to secondary
causes. It can't be this drink itself that poisons them, I said
always. This drink is medicinal and strengthening: I see
that it kills them, but it must be because they drink it cold
when they have been hot, or they take something else with it
that changes it into poison. The drink itself must be good.
Well, gentlemen, I found out the drink itself to be poison at
last, by the breaking of my choicest Venice glass. I could
not make out what it was that had killed Tintoret, and laid
it long to the charge of chiaroscuro. It was only after my
thorough study of his Paradise, in 1870, that I gave up this
idea, finding the chiaroscuro, which I had thought exaggerated,
was, in all original and undarkened passages, beautiful
and most precious. And then at last I got hold of the true
clue: "Il disegno di Michel Agnolo." And the moment I
had dared to accuse that, it explained everything; and I saw
that the betraying demons of Italian art, led on by Michael
Angelo, had been, not pleasure, but knowledge; not indolence,
but ambition; and not love, but horror.

164. But when first I ventured to tell you this, I did not
know, myself, the fact of all most conclusive for its confirmation.
It will take me a little while to put it before you in its
total force, and I must first ask your attention to a minor
point. In one of the smaller rooms of the Munich Gallery
is Holbein's painting of St. Margaret and St. Elizabeth of[Pg 97]
Hungary,&mdash;standard of his early religious work. Here is a
photograph from the St. Elizabeth; and, in the same frame,
a French lithograph of it. I consider it one of the most important
pieces of comparison I have arranged for you, showing
you at a glance the difference between true and false sentiment.
Of that difference, generally, we cannot speak to-day,
but one special result of it you are to observe;&mdash;the omission,
in the French drawing, of Holbein's daring representation
of disease, which is one of the vital honors of the picture.
Quite one of the chief strengths of St. Elizabeth, in the
Roman Catholic view, was in the courage of her dealing with
disease, chiefly leprosy. Now observe, I say Roman Catholic
view, very earnestly just now; I am not at all sure that it is
so in a Catholic view&mdash;that is to say, in an eternally Christian
and Divine view. And this doubt, very nearly now a certainty,
only came clearly into my mind the other day after
many and many a year's meditation on it. I had read with
great reverence all the beautiful stories about Christ's appearing
as a leper, and the like; and had often pitied and rebuked
myself alternately for my intense dislike and horror of disease.
I am writing at this moment within fifty yards of the
grave of St. Francis, and the story of the likeness of his feelings
to mine had a little comforted me, and the tradition of
his conquest of them again humiliated me; and I was thinking
very gravely of this, and of the parallel instance of Bishop
Hugo of Lincoln, always desiring to do service to the dead, as
opposed to my own unmitigated and Louis-Quinze-like horror
of funerals;&mdash;when by chance, in the cathedral of Palermo,
a new light was thrown for me on the whole matter.

165. I was drawing the tomb of Frederick II., which is
shut off by a grating from the body of the church; and I had,
in general, quite an unusual degree of quiet and comfort at
my work. But sometimes it was paralyzed by the unconscious
interference of one of the men employed in some minor
domestic services about the church. When he had nothing to
do, he used to come and seat himself near my grating, not to
look at my work, (the poor wretch had no eyes, to speak of,)[Pg 98]
nor in any way meaning to be troublesome; but there was
his habitual seat. His nose had been carried off by the most
loathsome of diseases; there were two vivid circles of scarlet
round his eyes; and as he sat, he announced his presence
every quarter of a minute (if otherwise I could have forgotten
it) by a peculiarly disgusting, loud, and long expectoration.
On the second or third day, just I had forced myself
into some forgetfulness of him, and was hard at my work, I
was startled from it again by the bursting out of a loud and
cheerful conversation close to me; and on looking round, saw
a lively young fledgling of a priest, seventeen or eighteen
years old, in the most eager and spirited chat with the man
in the chair. He talked, laughed, and spat, himself, companionably,
in the merriest way, for a quarter of an hour;
evidently without feeling the slightest disgust, or being made
serious for an instant, by the aspect of the destroyed creature
before him.

166. His own face was simply that of the ordinary vulgar
type of thoughtless young Italians, rather beneath than above
the usual standard; and I was certain, as I watched him, that
he was not at all my superior, but very much my inferior, in
the coolness with which he beheld what was to me so dreadful.
I was positive that he could look this man in the face, precisely
because he could not look, discerningly, at any beautiful
or noble thing; and that the reason I dared not, was because
I had, spiritually, as much better eyes than the priest,
as, bodily, than his companion.

Having got so much of clear evidence given me on the matter,
it was driven home for me a week later, as I landed on
the quay of Naples. Almost the first thing that presented
itself to me was the sign of a traveling theatrical company,
displaying the principal scene of the drama to be enacted on
their classical stage. Fresh from the theater of Taormina, I
was curious to see the subject of the Neapolitan popular
drama. It was the capture, by the police, of a man and his
wife who lived by boiling children. One section of the police
was coming in, armed to the teeth, through the passage;[Pg 99]
another section of the police, armed to the teeth, and with
high feathers in its caps, was coming up through a trap-door.
In fine dramatic unconsciousness to the last moment, like the
clown in a pantomime, the child-boiler was represented as still
industriously chopping up a child, pieces of which, ready for
the pot, lay here and there on the table in the middle of the
picture. The child-boiler's wife, however, just as she was
taking the top off the pot to put the meat in, had caught a
glimpse of the foremost policeman, and stopped, as much in
rage as in consternation.

167. Now it is precisely the same feeling, or want of feeling,
in the lower Italian (nor always in the lower classes only)
which makes him demand the kind of subject for his secular
drama; and the Crucifixion and Piet&agrave; for his religious drama.
The only part of Christianity he can enjoy is its horror; and
even the saint and saintess are not always denying themselves
severely, either by the contemplation of torture, or the companionship
with disease.

Nevertheless, we must be cautious, on the other hand, to
allow full value to the endurance, by tender and delicate persons,
of what is really loathsome or distressful to them in the
service of others; and I think this picture of Holbein's indicative
of the exact balance and rightness of his own mind in
this matter, and therefore of his power to conceive a true saint
also. He had to represent St. Catherine's chief effort;&mdash;he
paints her ministering to the sick, and, among them, is a
leper; and finding it thus his duty to paint leprosy, he courageously
himself studies it from the life. Not to insist on its
horror; but to assert it, to the needful point of fact, which he
does with medical accuracy.

Now here is just a case in which science, in a subordinate
degree, is really required for a spiritual and moral purpose.
And you find Holbein does not shrink from it even in this
extreme case in which it is most painful.

168. If, therefore, you do find him in other cases not using
it, you may be sure he knew it to be unnecessary.

Now it may be disputable whether in order to draw a living[Pg 100]
Madonna, one needs to know how many ribs she has; but it
would have seemed indisputable that in order to draw a skeleton,
one must know how many ribs it has.

Holbein is par excellence the draughtsman of skeletons.
His painted Dance of Death was, and his engraved Dance of
Death is, principal of such things, without any comparison or
denial. He draws skeleton after skeleton, in every possible
gesture; but never so much as counts their ribs! He neither
knows nor cares how many ribs a skeleton has. There are
always enough to rattle.

Monstrous, you think, in impudence,&mdash;Holbein for his
carelessness, and I for defending him! Nay, I triumph in
him; nothing has ever more pleased me than this grand negligence.
Nobody wants to know how many ribs a skeleton has,
any more than how many bars a gridiron has, so long as the
one can breathe, and the other broil; and still less, when the
breath and the fire are both out.

169. But is it only of the bones, think you, that Holbein
is careless?[AP] Nay, incredible though it may seem to you,&mdash;but,
to me, explanatory at once of much of his excellence,&mdash;he
did not know anatomy at all! I told you in my Preface,[AQ]
already quoted, Holbein studies the face first, the body secondarily;
but I had no idea, myself, how completely he had
refused the venomous science of his day. I showed you a
dead Christ of his, long ago. Can you match it with your
academy drawings, think you? And yet he did not, and
would not, know anatomy. He would not; but D&uuml;rer would,
and did:&mdash;went hotly into it&mdash;wrote books upon it, and upon
'proportions of the human body,' etc., etc., and all your
modern recipes for painting flesh. How did his studies prosper
his art?

People are always talking of his Knight and Death, and
his Melancholia, as if those were his principal works. They[Pg 101]
are his characteristic ones, and show what he might have been
without his anatomy; but they were mere by-play compared
to his Greater Fortune, and Adam and Eve. Look at these.
Here is his full energy displayed; here are both male and
female forms drawn with perfect knowledge of their bones
and muscles, and modes of action and digestion,&mdash;and I hope
you are pleased.

But it is not anatomy only that Master Albert studies.
He has a taste for optics also; and knows all about refraction
and reflection. What with his knowledge of the skull inside,
and the vitreous lens outside, if any man in the world is to
draw an eye, here's the man to do it, surely! With a hand
which can give lessons to John Bellini, and a care which
would fain do all so that it can't be done better, and acquaintance
with every crack in the cranium, and every humor in
the lens,&mdash;if we can't draw an eye, we should just like to
know who can! thinks Albert.

So having to engrave the portrait of Melanchthon, instead
of looking at Melanchthon as ignorant Holbein would have
been obliged to do,&mdash;wise Albert looks at the room window;
and finds it has four cross-bars in it, and knows scientifically
that the light on Melanchthon's eye must be a reflection of the
window with its four bars&mdash;and engraves it so, accordingly;
and who shall dare to say, now, it isn't like Melanchthon?

Unfortunately, however, it isn't, nor like any other person
in his senses; but like a madman looking at somebody who disputes
his hobby. While in this drawing of Holbein's, where
a dim gray shadow leaves a mere crumb of white paper,&mdash;accidentally
it seems, for all the fine scientific reflection,&mdash;behold,
it is an eye indeed, and of a noble creature.

170. What is the reason? do you ask me; and is all the
common teaching about generalization of details true, then?

No; not a syllable of it is true. Holbein is right, not because
he draws more generally, but more truly, than D&uuml;rer.
D&uuml;rer draws what he knows is there; but Holbein, only what
he sees. And, as I have told you often before, the really
scientific artist is he who not only asserts bravely what he[Pg 102]
does see, but confesses honestly what he does not. You must
not draw all the hairs in an eyelash; not because it is sublime
to generalize them, but because it is impossible to see them.
How many hairs there are, a sign painter or anatomist may
count; but how few of them you can see, it is only the utmost
masters, Carpaccio, Tintoret, Reynolds, and Velasquez, who
count, or know.

171. Such was the effect, then, of his science upon D&uuml;rer's
ideal of beauty, and skill in portraiture. What effect had it
on the temper and quantity of his work, as compared with
poor ignorant Holbein's! You have only three portraits, by
D&uuml;rer, of the great men of his time, and those bad ones;
while he toils his soul out to draw the hoofs of satyrs, the
bristles of swine, and the distorted aspects of base women and
vicious men.

What, on the contrary, has ignorant Holbein done for you?
Shakespeare and he divide between them, by word and look,
the Story of England under Henry and Elizabeth.

172. Of the effect of science on the art of Mantegna and
Marc Antonio, (far more deadly than on D&uuml;rer's,) I must
tell you in a future lecture;&mdash;the effect of it on their minds,
I must partly refer to now, in passing to the third head of my
general statement&mdash;the influence of new Theology. For
D&uuml;rer and Mantegna, chiefly because of their science, forfeited
their place, not only as painters of men, but as servants
of God. Neither of them has left one completely noble or
completely didactic picture; while Holbein and Botticelli, in
consummate pieces of art, led the way before the eyes of all
men, to the purification of their Church and land.

173. III. But the need of reformation presented itself to
these two men last named on entirely different terms.

To Holbein, when the word of the Catholic Church proved
false, and its deeds bloody; when he saw it selling permission
of sin in his native Augsburg, and strewing the ashes of its
enemies on the pure Alpine waters of Constance, what refuge
was there for him in more ancient religion? Shall he worship
Thor again, and mourn over the death of Balder? He[Pg 103]
reads Nature in her desolate and narrow truth, and she
teaches him the Triumph of Death.

But, for Botticelli, the grand gods are old, are immortal.
The priests may have taught falsely the story of the Virgin;&mdash;did
they not also lie, in the name of Artemis, at Ephesus;&mdash;in
the name of Aphrodite, at Cyprus?&mdash;but shall, therefore,
Chastity or Love be dead, or the full moon paler over
Arno? Saints of Heaven and Gods of Earth!&mdash;shall these
perish because vain men speak evil of them! Let us speak
good forever, and grave, as on the rock, for ages to come, the
glory of Beauty, and the triumph of Faith.

174. Holbein had bitterer task.

Of old, the one duty of the painter had been to exhibit the
virtues of this life, and hopes of the life to come. Holbein
had to show the vices of this life, and to obscure the hope of
the future. "Yes, we walk through the valley of the shadow
of death, and fear all evil, for Thou art not with us, and Thy
rod and Thy staff comfort us not." He does not choose this
task. It is thrust upon him,&mdash;just as fatally as the burial
of the dead is in a plague-struck city. These are the things
he sees, and must speak. He will not become a better artist
thereby; no drawing of supreme beauty, or beautiful things,
will be possible to him. Yet we cannot say he ought to have
done anything else, nor can we praise him specially in doing
this. It is his fate; the fate of all the bravest in that day.





THE CHILD'S BEDTIME.
(Fig. 5) Facsimile from Holbein's woodcut.


175. For instance, there is no scene about which a shallow
and feeble painter would have been more sure to adopt the
commonplaces of the creed of his time than the death of a
child,&mdash;chiefly, and most of all, the death of a country child,&mdash;a
little thing fresh from the cottage and the field. Surely
for such an one, angels will wait by its sick bed, and rejoice
as they bear its soul away; and over its shroud flowers will
be strewn, and the birds will sing by its grave. So your
common sentimentalist would think, and paint. Holbein
sees the facts, as they verily are, up to the point when vision
ceases. He speaks, then, no more.

The country laborer's cottage&mdash;the rain coming through its[Pg 104]
roof, the clay crumbling from its partitions, the fire lighted
with a few chips and sticks on a raised piece of the mud floor,&mdash;such
dais as can be contrived, for use, not for honor. The
damp wood sputters; the smoke, stopped by the roof, though
the rain is not, coils round again, and down. But the
mother can warm the child's supper of bread and milk so&mdash;holding
the pan by the long handle; and on mud floor though
it be, they are happy,&mdash;she, and her child, and its brother,&mdash;if
only they could be left so. They shall not be left so: the
young thing must leave them&mdash;will never need milk warmed
for it any more. It would fain stay,&mdash;sees no angels&mdash;feels
only an icy grip on its hand, and that it cannot stay. Those
who loved it shriek and tear their hair in vain, amazed in
grief. 'Oh, little one, must you lie out in the fields then, not
even under this poor torn roof of thy mother's to-night?'





"HE THAT HATH EARS TO HEAR, LET HIM HEAR."
(Fig. 6) Facsimile from Holbein's woodcut.


176. Again: there was not in the old creed any subject
more definitely and constantly insisted on than the death of
a miser. He had been happy, the old preachers thought,
till then: but his hour has come; and the black covetousness
of hell is awake and watching; the sharp harpy claws will
clutch his soul out of his mouth, and scatter his treasure for
others. So the commonplace preacher and painter taught.
Not so Holbein. The devil want to snatch his soul, indeed!
Nay, he never had a soul, but of the devil's giving. His
misery to begin on his death-bed! Nay, he had never an
unmiserable hour of life. The fiend is with him now,&mdash;a
paltry, abortive fiend, with no breath even to blow hot with.
He supplies the hell-blast with a machine. It is winter,
and the rich man has his furred cloak and cap, thick and
heavy; the beggar, bare-headed to beseech him, skin and rags
hanging about him together, touches his shoulder, but all
in vain; there is other business in hand. More haggard than
the beggar himself, wasted and palsied, the rich man counts
with his fingers the gain of the years to come.

But of those years, infinite that are to be, Holbein says
nothing. 'I know not; I see not. This only I see, on this
very winter's day, the low pale stumbling-block at your feet,[Pg 105]
the altogether by you unseen and forgotten Death. You
shall not pass him by on the other side; here is a fasting figure
in skin and bone, at last, that will stop you; and for all the
hidden treasures of earth, here is your spade: dig now, and
find them.'

177. I have said that Holbein was condemned to teach
these things. He was not happy in teaching them, nor
thanked for teaching them. Nor was Botticelli for his lovelier
teaching. But they both could do no otherwise. They
lived in truth and steadfastness; and with both, in their
marvelous design, veracity is the beginning of invention, and
love its end.

I have but time to show you, in conclusion, how this affectionate
self-forgetfulness protects Holbein from the chief
calamity of the German temper, vanity, which is at the root of
all D&uuml;rer's weakness. Here is a photograph of Holbein's
portrait of Erasmus, and a fine proof of D&uuml;rer's. In
Holbein's, the face leads everything; and the most lovely
qualities of the face lead in that. The cloak and cap are
perfectly painted, just because you look at them neither more
nor less than you would have looked at the cloak in reality.
You don't say, 'How brilliantly they are touched,' as you
would with Rembrandt; nor 'How gracefully they are
neglected,' as you would with Gainsborough; nor 'How
exquisitely they are shaded,' as you would with Lionardo;
nor 'How grandly they are composed,' as you would with
Titian. You say only, 'Erasmus is surely there; and what
a pleasant sight!' You don't think of Holbein at all. He
has not even put in the minutest letter H, that I can see, to
remind you of him. Drops his H's, I regret to say, often
enough. 'My hand should be enough for you; what matters
my name?' But now, look at D&uuml;rer's. The very first thing
you see, and at any distance, is this great square tablet with

"The image of Erasmus, drawn from the life by Albert
D&uuml;rer, 1526,"

and a great straddling a.d. besides. Then you see a cloak,
and a table, and a pot, with flowers in it, and a heap of books[Pg 106]
with all their leaves and all their clasps, and all the little
bits of leather gummed in to mark the places; and last of all
you see Erasmus's face; and when you do see it, the most of
it is wrinkles.

All egotism and insanity, this, gentlemen. Hard words to
use; but not too hard to define the faults which rendered so
much of D&uuml;rer's great genius abortive, and to this day paralyze,
among the details of a lifeless and ambitious precision,
the student, no less than the artist, of German blood. For
too many an Erasmus, too many a D&uuml;rer, among them, the
world is all cloak and clasp, instead of face or book; and the
first object of their lives is to engrave their initials.

178. For us, in England, not even so much is at present to
be hoped; and yet, singularly enough, it is more our modesty,
unwisely submissive, than our vanity, which has destroyed
our English school of engraving.

At the bottom of the pretty line engravings which used to
represent, characteristically, our English skill, one saw
always two inscriptions. At the left-hand corner, "Drawn
by&mdash;so-and-so;" at the right-hand corner, "Engraved by&mdash;so-and-so."
Only under the worst and cheapest plates&mdash;for
the Stationers' Almanack, or the like&mdash;one saw sometimes,
"Drawn and engraved by&mdash;so-and-so," which meant nothing
more than that the publisher would not go to the expense of
an artist, and that the engraver haggled through as he could.
(One fortunate exception, gentlemen, you have in the old
drawings for your Oxford Almanack, though the publishers,
I have no doubt, even in that case, employed the cheapest
artist they could find.[AR]) But in general, no engraver thought
himself able to draw; and no artist thought it his business
to engrave.[Pg 107]

179. But the fact that this and the following lecture are
on the subject of design in engraving, implies of course that
in the work we have to examine, it was often the engraver
himself who designed, and as often the artist who engraved.

And you will observe that the only engravings which bear
imperishable value are, indeed, in this kind. It is true that,
in wood-cutting, both D&uuml;rer and Holbein, as in our own days
Leech and Tenniel, have workmen under them who can do
all they want. But in metal cutting it is not so. For, as I
have told you, in metal cutting, ultimate perfection of Line
has to be reached; and it can be reached by none but a
master's hand; nor by his, unless in the very moment and act
of designing. Never, unless under the vivid first force of
imagination and intellect, can the Line have its full value.
And for this high reason, gentlemen, that paradox which
perhaps seemed to you so daring, is nevertheless deeply and
finally true, that while a woodcut may be laboriously
finished, a grand engraving on metal must be comparatively
incomplete. For it must be done, throughout, with the full
fire of temper in it, visibly governing its lines, as the wind
does the fibers of cloud.

180. The value hitherto attached to Rembrandt's etchings,
and others imitating them, depends on a true instinct in the
public mind for this virtue of line. But etching is an indolent
and blundering method at the best; and I do not doubt that
you will one day be grateful for the severe disciplines of
drawing required in these schools, in that they will have
enabled you to know what a line may be, driven by a master's
chisel on silver or marble, following, and fostering as it
follows, the instantaneous strength of his determined thought.

FOOTNOTES:

[AG] If you paint a bottle only to amuse the spectator by showing him
how like a painting may be to a bottle, you cannot be considered, in art-philosophy,
as a designer. But if you paint the cork flying out of the
bottle, and the contents arriving in an arch at the mouth of a recipient
glass, you are so far forth a designer or signer; probably meaning to
express certain ultimate facts respecting, say, the hospitable disposition
of the landlord of the house; but at all events representing the bottle
and glass in a designed, and not merely natural, manner. Not merely
natural&mdash;nay, in some sense non-natural, or supernatural. And all
great artists show both this fantastic condition of mind in their work,
and show that it has arisen out of a communicative or didactic purpose.
They are the Signpainters of God.

scientific one ought not to be allowed in our Universities. There is a
science of Morals, a science of History, a science of Grammar, a science
of Music, and a science of Painting; and all these are quite beyond
comparison higher fields for human intellect, and require accuracies
of intenser observation, than either chemistry, electricity, or geology.

LECTURE VI.

DESIGN IN THE FLORENTINE SCHOOLS OF ENGRAVING.


181. In the first of these lectures, I stated to you their
subject, as the investigation of the engraved work of a group
of men, to whom engraving, as a means of popular address,
was above all precious, because their art was distinctively
didactic.

Some of my hearers must be aware that, of late years, the
assertion that art should be didactic has been clamorously and
violently derided by the countless crowd of artists who have
nothing to represent, and of writers who have nothing to say;
and that the contrary assertion&mdash;that art consists only in
pretty colors and fine words,&mdash;is accepted, readily enough,
by a public which rarely pauses to look at a picture with
attention, or read a sentence with understanding.

182. Gentlemen, believe me, there never was any great
advancing art yet, nor can be, without didactic purpose.
The leaders of the strong schools are, and must be always,
either teachers of theology, or preachers of the moral law.
I need not tell you that it was as teachers of theology on the
walls of the Vatican that the masters with whose names you
are most familiar obtained their perpetual fame. But however
great their fame, you have not practically, I imagine,
ever been materially assisted in your preparation for the
schools either of philosophy or divinity by Raphael's
'School of Athens,' by Raphael's 'Theology,'&mdash;or by Michael
Angelo's 'Judgment.' My task, to-day, is to set before you
some part of the design of the first Master of the works in
the Sistine Chapel; and I believe that, from his teaching, you
will, even in the hour which I ask you now to give, learn
what may be of true use to you in all your future labor,
whether in Oxford or elsewhere.[Pg 109]

183. You have doubtless, in the course of these lectures,
been occasionally surprised by my speaking of Holbein and
Sandro Botticelli, as Reformers, in the same tone of respect,
and with the same implied assertion of their intellectual
power and agency, with which it is usual to speak of Luther
and Savonarola. You have been accustomed, indeed, to hear
painting and sculpture spoken of as supporting or enforcing
Church doctrine; but never as reforming or chastising it.
Whether Protestant or Roman Catholic, you have admitted
what in the one case you held to be the abuse of painting in
the furtherance of idolatry,&mdash;in the other, its amiable and
exalting ministry to the feebleness of faith. But neither has
recognized,&mdash;the Protestant his ally,&mdash;or the Catholic his
enemy, in the far more earnest work of the great painters of
the fifteenth century. The Protestant was, in most cases, too
vulgar to understand the aid offered to him by painting; and
in all cases too terrified to believe in it. He drove the gift-bringing
Greek with imprecations from his sectarian fortress,
or received him within it only on the condition that he should
speak no word of religion there.

184. On the other hand, the Catholic, in most cases too
indolent to read, and, in all, too proud to dread, the rebuke of
the reforming painters, confused them with the crowd of his
old flatterers, and little noticed their altered language or
their graver brow. In a little while, finding they had ceased
to be amusing, he effaced their works, not as dangerous, but
as dull; and recognized only thenceforward, as art, the innocuous
bombast of Michael Angelo, and fluent efflorescence of
Bernini. But when you become more intimately and
impartially acquainted with the history of the Reformation,
you will find that, as surely and earnestly as Memling and
Giotto strove in the north and south to set forth and exalt
the Catholic faith, so surely and earnestly did Holbein and
Botticelli strive, in the north, to chastise, and, in the south,
to revive it. In what manner, I will try to-day briefly to
show you.

185. I name these two men as the reforming leaders: there[Pg 110]
were many, rank and file, who worked in alliance with
Holbein; with Botticelli, two great ones, Lippi and Perugino.
But both of these had so much pleasure in their own pictorial
faculty, that they strove to keep quiet, and out of harm's
way,&mdash;involuntarily manifesting themselves sometimes, however;
and not in the wisest manner. Lippi's running away
with a novice was not likely to be understood as a step in
Church reformation correspondent to Luther's marriage.[AS]
Nor have Protestant divines, even to this day, recognized the
real meaning of the reports of Perugino's 'infidelity.' Botticelli,
the pupil of the one, and the companion of the other,
held the truths they taught him through sorrow as well as
joy; and he is the greatest of the reformers, because he
preached without blame; though the least known, because
he died without victory.

I had hoped to be able to lay before you some better
biography of him than the traditions of Vasari, of which I
gave a short abstract some time back in Fors Clavigera
(Letter XXII.); but as yet I have only added internal
evidence to the popular story, the more important points of
which I must review briefly. It will not waste your time if
I read,&mdash;instead of merely giving you reference to,&mdash;the
passages on which I must comment.

186. "His father, Mariano Filipepi, a Florentine citizen,
brought him up with care, and caused him to be instructed in
all such things as are usually taught to children before they
choose a calling. But although the boy readily acquired
whatever he wished to learn, yet was he constantly discontented;
neither would he take any pleasure in reading,
writing, or accounts, insomuch that the father, disturbed by
the eccentric habits of his son, turned him over in despair[Pg 111]
to a gossip of his, called Botticello, who was a goldsmith, and
considered a very competent master of his art, to the intent
that the boy might learn the same."

"He took no pleasure in reading, writing, nor accounts"!
You will find the same thing recorded of Cimabue; but it
is more curious when stated of a man whom I cite to you as
typically a gentleman and a scholar. But remember, in those
days, though there were not so many entirely correct books
issued by the Religious Tract Society for boys to read, there
were a great many more pretty things in the world for boys
to see. The Val d'Arno was Pater-noster Row to purpose;
their Father's Row, with books of His writing on the mountain
shelves. And the lad takes to looking at things, and
thinking about them, instead of reading about them,&mdash;which
I commend to you also, as much the more scholarly practice of
the two. To the end, though he knows all about the celestial
hierarchies, he is not strong in his letters, nor in his dialect.
I asked Mr. Tyrwhitt to help me through with a bit of his
Italian the other day. Mr. Tyrwhitt could only help me by
suggesting that it was "Botticelli for so-and-so." And one
of the minor reasons which induced me so boldly to attribute
these sibyls to him, instead of Bandini, is that the lettering
is so ill done. The engraver would assuredly have had his
lettering all right,&mdash;or at least neat. Botticelli blunders
through it, scratches impatiently out when he goes wrong:
and as I told you there's no repentance in the engraver's
trade, leaves all the blunders visible.

187. I may add one fact bearing on this question lately
communicated to me.[AT] In the autumn of 1872 I possessed
myself of an Italian book of pen drawings, some, I have no
doubt, by Mantegna in his youth, others by Sandro himself.
In examining these, I was continually struck by the comparatively
feeble and blundering way in which the titles were
written, while all the rest of the handling was really superb;
and still more surprised when, on the sleeves and hem of the[Pg 112]
robe of one of the principal figures of women, ("Helena
rapita da Paris,") I found what seemed to be meant for
inscriptions, intricately embroidered; which nevertheless,
though beautifully drawn, I could not read. In copying
Botticelli's Zipporah this spring, I found the border of her
robe wrought with characters of the same kind, which a
young painter, working with me, who already knows the
minor secrets of Italian art better than I,[AU] assures me are
letters,&mdash;and letters of a language hitherto undeciphered.

188. "There was at that time a close connection and
almost constant intercourse between the goldsmiths and the
painters, wherefore Sandro, who possessed considerable
ingenuity, and was strongly disposed to the arts of design,
became enamored of painting, and resolved to devote himself
entirely to that vocation. He acknowledged his purpose at
once to his father; and the latter, who knew the force of his
inclination, took him accordingly to the Carmelite monk,
Fra Filippo, who was a most excellent painter of that time,
with whom he placed him to study the art, as Sandro himself
had desired. Devoting himself thereupon entirely to the
vocation he had chosen, Sandro so closely followed the directions,
and imitated the manner, of his master, that Fra
Filippo conceived a great love for him, and instructed him
so effectually, that Sandro rapidly attained to such a degree
in art as none would have predicted for him."

I have before pointed out to you the importance of training
by the goldsmith. Sandro got more good of it, however,
than any of the other painters so educated,&mdash;being enabled
by it to use gold for light to color, in a glowing harmony
never reached with equal perfection, and rarely attempted,
in the later schools. To the last, his paintings are partly
treated as work in niello; and he names himself, in perpetual
gratitude, from this first artisan master. Nevertheless, the
fortunate fellow finds, at the right moment, another, even
more to his mind, and is obedient to him through his youth,
as to the other through his childhood. And this master loves[Pg 113]
him; and instructs him 'so effectually,'&mdash;in grinding colors,
do you suppose, only; or in laying of lines only; or in anything
more than these?

189. I will tell you what Lippi must have taught any boy
whom he loved. First, humility, and to live in joy and
peace, injuring no man&mdash;if such innocence might be. Nothing
is so manifest in every face by him, as its gentleness and
rest. Secondly, to finish his work perfectly, and in such
temper that the angels might say of it&mdash;not he himself&mdash;'Iste
perfecit opus.' Do you remember what I told you in the
Eagle's Nest (&sect; 53), that true humility was in hoping that
angels might sometimes admire our work; not in hoping that
we should ever be able to admire theirs? Thirdly,&mdash;a little
thing it seems, but was a great one,&mdash;love of flowers. No one
draws such lilies or such daisies as Lippi. Botticelli beat
him afterwards in roses, but never in lilies. Fourthly, due
honor for classical tradition. Lippi is the only religious
painter who dresses John Baptist in the camelskin, as the
Greeks dressed Heracles in the lion's&mdash;over the head. Lastly,
and chiefly of all,&mdash;Le P&egrave;re Hyacinthe taught his pupil
certain views about the doctrine of the Church, which the boy
thought of more deeply than his tutor, and that by a great
deal; and Master Sandro presently got himself into such
question for painting heresy, that if he had been as hot-headed
as he was true-hearted, he would soon have come to
bad end by the tar-barrel. But he is so sweet and so modest,
that nobody is frightened; so clever, that everybody is
pleased: and at last, actually the Pope sends for him to
paint his own private chapel,&mdash;where the first thing my
young gentleman does, mind you, is to paint the devil in a
monk's dress, tempting Christ! The sauciest thing, out and
out, done in the history of the Reformation, it seems to me;
yet so wisely done, and with such true respect otherwise
shown for what was sacred in the Church, that the Pope
didn't mind: and all went on as merrily as marriage bells.

190. I have anticipated, however, in telling you this, the
proper course of his biography, to which I now return.[Pg 114]

"While still a youth he painted the figure of Fortitude,
among those pictures of the Virtues which Antonio and
Pietro Pollaiuolo were executing in the Mercatanzia, or
Tribunal of Commerce, in Florence. In Santo Spirito, a
church of the same city, he painted a picture for the chapel
of the Bardi family: this work he executed with great diligence,
and finished it very successfully, depicting certain
olive and palm trees therein with extraordinary care."

It is by a beautiful chance that the first work of his,
specified by his Italian biographer, should be the Fortitude.[AV]
Note also what is said of his tree drawing.

"Having, in consequence of this work, obtained much
credit and reputation, Sandro was appointed by the Guild of
Porta Santa Maria to paint a picture in San Marco, the
subject of which is the Coronation of Our Lady, who is
surrounded by a choir of angels&mdash;the whole extremely well
designed, and finished by the artist with infinite care. He
executed various works in the Medici Palace for the elder
Lorenzo, more particularly a figure of Pallas on a shield
wreathed with vine branches, whence flames are proceeding:
this he painted of the size of life. A San Sebastiano was
also among the most remarkable of the works executed for
Lorenzo. In the church of Santa Maria Maggiore, in Florence,
is a Piet&agrave;, with small figures, by this master: this is
a very beautiful work. For different houses in various parts
of the city Sandro painted many pictures of a round form,
with numerous figures of women undraped. Of these there
are still two examples at Castello, a villa of the Duke Cosimo,&mdash;one
representing the birth of Venus, who is borne to earth
by the Loves and Zephyrs; the second also presenting the
figure of Venus crowned with flowers by the Graces: she is
here intended to denote the Spring, and the allegory is
expressed by the painter with extraordinary grace."

Our young Reformer enters, it seems, on a very miscellaneous
course of study; the Coronation of Our Lady; St.[Pg 115]
Sebastian; Pallas in vine-leaves; and Venus,&mdash;without fig-leaves.
Not wholly Calvinistic, Fra Filippo's teaching seems
to have been! All the better for the boy&mdash;being such a boy
as he was: but I cannot in this lecture enter farther into my
reasons for saying so.

191. Vasari, however, has shot far ahead in telling us of
this picture of the Spring, which is one of Botticelli's completest
works. Long before he was able to paint Greek
nymphs, he had done his best in idealism of greater spirits;
and, while yet quite a youth, painted, at Castello, the Assumption
of Our Lady, with "the patriarchs, the prophets, the
apostles, the evangelists, the martyrs, the confessors, the
doctors, the virgins, and the hierarchies!"

Imagine this subject proposed to a young, (or even old)
British Artist, for his next appeal to public sensation at the
Academy! But do you suppose that the young British artist
is wiser and more civilized than Lippi's scholar, because his
only idea of a patriarch is of a man with a long beard; of
a doctor, the M.D. with the brass plate over the way; and of
a virgin, Miss &mdash;&mdash; of the &mdash;&mdash; theater?

Not that even Sandro was able, according to Vasari's
report, to conduct the entire design himself. The proposer of
the subject assisted him; and they made some modifications
in the theology, which brought them both into trouble&mdash;so
early did Sandro's innovating work begin, into which subjects
our gossiping friend waives unnecessary inquiry, as
follows.

"But although this picture is exceedingly beautiful, and
ought to have put envy to shame, yet there were found certain
malevolent and censorious persons who, not being able to
affix any other blame to the work, declared that Matteo and
Sandro had erred gravely in that matter, and had fallen into
grievous heresy.

"Now, whether this be true or not, let none expect the
judgment of that question from me: it shall suffice me to
note that the figures executed by Sandro in that work are
entirely worthy of praise; and that the pains he took in[Pg 116]
depicting those circles of the heavens must have been very
great, to say nothing of the angels mingled with the other
figures, or of the various foreshortenings, all which are
designed in a very good manner.

"About this time Sandro received a commission to paint
a small picture with figures three parts of a braccio high,&mdash;the
subject an Adoration of the Magi.

"It is indeed a most admirable work; the composition, the
design, and the coloring are so beautiful that every artist who
examines it is astonished; and, at the time, it obtained so
great a name in Florence, and other places, for the master,
that Pope Sixtus IV. having erected the chapel built by him
in his palace at Rome, and desiring to have it adorned with
paintings, commanded that Sandro Botticelli should be
appointed Superintendent of the work."

192. Vasari's words, "about this time," are evidently
wrong. It must have been many and many a day after he
painted Matteo's picture that he took such high standing in
Florence as to receive the mastership of the works in the
Pope's chapel at Rome. Of his position and doings there, I
will tell you presently; meantime, let us complete the story
of his life.

"By these works Botticelli obtained great honor and reputation
among the many competitors who were laboring with
him, whether Florentines or natives of other cities, and received
from the Pope a considerable sum of money; but this
he consumed and squandered totally, during his residence in
Rome, where he lived without due care, as was his habit."

193. Well, but one would have liked to hear how he squandered
his money, and whether he was without care&mdash;of other
things than money.

It is just possible, Master Vasari, that Botticelli may have
laid out his money at higher interest than you know of;
meantime, he is advancing in life and thought, and becoming
less and less comprehensible to his biographer. And at
length, having got rid, somehow, of the money he received
from the Pope; and finished the work he had to do, and[Pg 117]
uncovered it,&mdash;free in conscience, and empty in purse, he
returned to Florence, where, "being a sophistical person, he
made a comment on a part of Dante, and drew the Inferno,
and put it in engraving, in which he consumed much time;
and not working for this reason, brought infinite disorder into
his affairs."

194. Unpaid work, this engraving of Dante, you perceive,&mdash;consuming
much time also, and not appearing to Vasari
to be work at all. It is but a short sentence, gentlemen,&mdash;this,
in the old edition of Vasari, and obscurely worded,&mdash;a
very foolish person's contemptuous report of a thing to him
totally incomprehensible. But the thing itself is out-and-out
the most important fact in the history of the religious art
of Italy. I can show you its significance in not many more
words than have served to record it.

Botticelli had been painting in Rome; and had expressly
chosen to represent there,&mdash;being Master of Works, in the
presence of the Defender of the Faith,&mdash;the foundation of
the Mosaic law; to his mind the Eternal Law of God,&mdash;that
law of which modern Evangelicals sing perpetually their
own original psalm, "Oh, how hate I Thy law! it is my
abomination all the day." Returning to Florence, he reads
Dante's vision of the Hell created by its violation. He
knows that the pictures he has painted in Rome cannot be
understood by the people; they are exclusively for the best
trained scholars in the Church. Dante, on the other hand,
can only be read in manuscript; but the people could and
would understand his lessons, if they were pictured in accessible
and enduring form. He throws all his own lauded work
aside,&mdash;all for which he is most honored, and in which his
now matured and magnificent skill is as easy to him as singing
to a perfect musician. And he sets himself to a servile
and despised labor,&mdash;his friends mocking him, his resources
failing him, infinite 'disorder' getting into his affairs&mdash;of
this world.

195. Never such another thing happened in Italy any
more. Botticelli engraved her Pilgrim's Progress for her,[Pg 118]
putting himself in prison to do it. She would not read it
when done. Raphael and Marc Antonio were the theologians
for her money. Pretty Madonnas, and satyrs with
abundance of tail,&mdash;let our pilgrim's progress be in these
directions, if you please.

Botticelli's own pilgrimage, however, was now to be accomplished
triumphantly, with such crowning blessings as Heaven
might grant to him. In spite of his friends and his disordered
affairs, he went his own obstinate way; and found
another man's words worth engraving as well as Dante's;
not without perpetuating, also, what he deemed worthy of
his own.

196. What would that be, think you? His chosen works
before the Pope in Rome?&mdash;his admired Madonnas in
Florence?&mdash;his choirs of angels and thickets of flowers?
Some few of these yes, as you shall presently see; but "the
best attempt of this kind from his hand is the Triumph of
Faith, by Fra Girolamo Savonarola, of Ferrara, of whose
sect our artist was so zealous a partisan that he totally
abandoned painting, and not having any other means of
living, he fell into very great difficulties. But his attachment
to the party he had adopted increased; he became what was
then called a Piagnone, or Mourner, and abandoned all labor;
insomuch that, finding himself at length become old, being
also very poor, he must have died of hunger had he not been
supported by Lorenzo de' Medici, for whom he had worked
at the small hospital of Volterra and other places, who
assisted him while he lived, as did other friends and admirers
of his talents."

197. In such dignity and independence&mdash;having employed
his talents not wholly at the orders of the dealer&mdash;died, a
poor bedesman of Lorenzo de' Medici, the President of that
high academy of art in Rome, whose Academicians were
Perugino, Ghirlandajo, Angelico, and Signorelli; and whose
students, Michael Angelo and Raphael.

'A worthless, ill-conducted fellow on the whole,' thinks
Vasari, 'with a crazy fancy for scratching on copper.'[Pg 119]

Well, here are some of the scratches for you to see; only,
first, I must ask you seriously for a few moments to consider
what the two powers were, which, with this iron pen of his,
he has set himself to reprove.

198. Two great forms of authority reigned over the entire
civilized world, confessedly, and by name, in the Middle
Ages. They reign over it still, and must forever, though
at present very far from confessed; and, in most places,
ragingly denied.

The first power is that of the Teacher, or true Father;
the Father 'in God.' It may be&mdash;happy the children to
whom it is&mdash;the actual father also; and whose parents have
been their tutors. But, for the most part, it will be some one
else who teaches them, and molds their minds and brain.
All such teaching, when true, being from above, and coming
down from the Father of Lights, with whom is no variableness,
neither shadow of turning, is properly that of the holy
Catholic '&#949;&#954;&#954;&#955;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#945;,' council, church, or papacy, of many fathers
in God, not of one. Eternally powerful and divine; reverenced
of all humble and lowly scholars, in Jewry, in Greece,
in Rome, in Gaul, in England, and beyond sea, from Arctic
zone to zone.

The second authority is the power of National Law, enforcing
justice in conduct by due reward and punishment. Power
vested necessarily in magistrates capable of administering it
with mercy and equity; whose authority, be it of many or
few, is again divine, as proceeding from the King of kings,
and was acknowledged, throughout civilized Christendom,
as the power of the Holy Empire, or Holy Roman Empire,
because first throned in Rome; but it is forever also acknowledged,
namelessly, or by name, by all loyal, obedient, just,
and humble hearts, which truly desire that, whether for them
or against them, the eternal equities and dooms of Heaven
should be pronounced and executed; and as the wisdom or
word of their Father should be taught, so the will of their
Father should be done, on earth, as it is in heaven.

199. You all here know what contention, first, and then[Pg 120]
what corruption and dishonor, had paralyzed these two powers
before the days of which we now speak. Reproof, and either
reform or rebellion, became necessary everywhere. The
northern Reformers, Holbein, and Luther, and Henry, and
Cromwell, set themselves to their task rudely, and, it might
seem, carried it through. The southern Reformers, Dante,
and Savonarola, and Botticelli, set hand to their task
reverently, and, it seemed, did not by any means carry it
through. But the end is not yet.

200. Now I shall endeavor to-day to set before you the
art of Botticelli, especially as exhibiting the modesty of
great imagination trained in reverence, which characterized
the southern Reformers; and as opposed to the immodesty
of narrow imagination, trained in self-trust, which characterized
the northern Reformers.

'The modesty of great imagination;' that is to say, of the
power which conceives all things in true relation, and not
only as they affect ourselves. I can show you this most
definitely by taking one example of the modern, and
unschooled temper, in Bewick;[AW] and setting it beside Botticelli's
treatment of the same subject of thought,&mdash;namely,
the meaning of war, and the reforms necessary in the carrying
on of war.

201. Both the men are entirely at one in their purpose.
They yearn for peace and justice to rule over the earth, instead
of the sword; but see how differently they will say what
is in their hearts to the people they address. To Bewick,
war was more an absurdity than it was a horror: he had not
seen battle-fields, still less had he read of them, in ancient
days. He cared nothing about heroes,&mdash;Greek, Roman, or
Norman. What he knew, and saw clearly, was that Farmer
Hodge's boy went out of the village one holiday afternoon, a[Pg 121]
fine young fellow, rather drunk, with a colored ribbon in
his hat; and came back, ten years afterwards, with one leg,
one eye, an old red coat, and a tobacco-pipe in the pocket of
it. That is what he has got to say, mainly. So, for the
pathetic side of the business, he draws you two old soldiers
meeting as bricklayers' laborers; and for the absurd side of
it, he draws a stone, sloping sideways with age, in a bare
field, on which you can just read, out of a long inscription,
the words "glorious victory;" but no one is there to read
them,&mdash;only a jackass, who uses the stone to scratch himself
against.

202. Now compare with this Botticelli's reproof of war.
He had seen it, and often; and between noble persons;&mdash;knew
the temper in which the noblest knights went out to it;&mdash;knew
the strength, the patience, the glory, and the grief of
it. He would fain see his Florence in peace; and yet he
knows that the wisest of her citizens are her bravest soldiers.
So he seeks for the ideal of a soldier, and for the greatest
glory of war, that in the presence of these he may speak
reverently, what he must speak. He does not go to Greece for
his hero. He is not sure that even her patriotic wars were
always right. But, by his religious faith, he cannot doubt
the nobleness of the soldier who put the children of Israel in
possession of their promised land, and to whom the sign of
the consent of heaven was given by its pausing light in the
valley of Ajalon. Must then setting sun and risen moon
stay, he thinks, only to look upon slaughter? May no soldier
of Christ bid them stay otherwise than so? He draws
Joshua, but quitting his hold of the sword: its hilt rests on
his bent knee; and he kneels before the sun, not commands
it; and this is his prayer:&mdash;

"Oh, King of kings, and Lord of lords, who alone rulest
always in eternity, and who correctest all our wanderings,&mdash;Giver
of melody to the choir of the angels, listen Thou a
little to our bitter grief, and come and rule us, oh Thou
highest King, with Thy love which is so sweet!"

Is not that a little better, and a little wiser, than Bewick's[Pg 122]
jackass? Is it not also better, and wiser, than the sneer of
modern science? 'What great men are we!&mdash;we, forsooth,
can make almanacs, and know that the earth turns round.
Joshua indeed! Let us have no more talk of the old-clothes-man.'

All Bewick's simplicity is in that; but none of Bewick's
understanding.

203. I pass to the attack made by Botticelli upon the
guilt of wealth. So I had at first written; but I should
rather have written, the appeal made by him against the
cruelty of wealth, then first attaining the power it has
maintained to this day.

The practice of receiving interest had been confined, until
this fifteenth century, with contempt and malediction, to the
profession, so styled, of usurers, or to the Jews. The merchants
of Augsburg introduced it as a convenient and
pleasant practice among Christians also; and insisted that
it was decorous and proper even among respectable merchants.
In the view of the Christian Church of their day, they might
more reasonably have set themselves to defend adultery.[AX]
However, they appointed Dr. John Eck, of Ingoldstadt, to
hold debates in all possible universities, at their expense, on
the allowing of interest; and as these Augsburgers had in
Venice their special mart, Fondaco, called of the Germans,
their new notions came into direct collision with old Venetian
ones, and were much hindered by them, and all the more,
because, in opposition to Dr. John Eck, there was preaching
on the other side of the Alps. The Franciscans, poor themselves,
preached mercy to the poor: one of them, Brother
Marco of San Gallo, planned the 'Mount of Pity' for their
defense, and the merchants of Venice set up the first in the
world, against the German Fondaco. The dispute burned
far on towards our own times. You perhaps have heard
before of one Antonio, a merchant of Venice, who persistently
retained the then obsolete practice of lending money
gratis, and of the peril it brought him into with the usurers.[Pg 123]
But you perhaps did not before know why it was the flesh, or
heart of flesh, in him, that they so hated.

204. Against this newly risen demon of authorized usury,
Holbein and Botticelli went out to war together. Holbein,
as we have partly seen in his designs for the Dance of Death,
struck with all his soldier's strength.[AY] Botticelli uses neither
satire nor reproach. He turns altogether away from the
criminals; appeals only to heaven for defense against them.
He engraves the design which, of all his work, must have
cost him hardest toil in its execution,&mdash;the Virgin praying
to her Son in heaven for pity upon the poor: "For these
are also my children."[AZ] Underneath, are the seven works
of Mercy; and in the midst of them, the building of the
Mount of Pity: in the distance lies Italy, mapped in cape
and bay, with the cities which had founded mounts of pity,&mdash;Venice
in the distance, chief. Little seen, but engraved
with the master's loveliest care, in the background there is
a group of two small figures&mdash;the Franciscan brother kneeling,
and an angel of Victory crowning him.

205. I call it an angel of Victory, observe, with assurance;
although there is no legend claiming victory, or distinguishing
this angel from any other of those which adorn with
crowns of flowers the nameless crowds of the blessed. For
Botticelli has other ways of speaking than by written legends.
I know by a glance at this angel that he has taken the action
of it from a Greek coin; and I know also that he had not,
in his own exuberant fancy, the least need to copy the action
of any figure whatever. So I understand, as well as if he
spoke to me, that he expects me, if I am an educated gentleman,
to recognize this particular action as a Greek angel's;
and to know that it is a temporal victory which it crowns.

206. And now farther, observe, that this classical learning
of Botticelli's, received by him, as I told you, as a native
element of his being, gives not only greater dignity and[Pg 124]
gentleness, but far wider range, to his thoughts of Reformation.
As he asks for pity from the cruel Jew to the poor
Gentile, so he asks for pity from the proud Christian to the
untaught Gentile. Nay, for more than pity, for fellowship,
and acknowledgment of equality before God. The learned
men of his age in general brought back the Greek mythology
as anti-Christian. But Botticelli and Perugino, as pre-Christian;
nor only as pre-Christian, but as the foundation of
Christianity. But chiefly Botticelli, with perfect grasp of
the Mosaic and classic theology, thought over and seized the
harmonies of both; and he it was who gave the conception of
that great choir of the prophets and sibyls, of which Michael
Angelo, more or less ignorantly borrowing it in the Sistine
Chapel, in great part lost the meaning, while he magnified
the aspect.

207. For, indeed, all Christian and heathen mythology had
alike become to Michael Angelo only a vehicle for the display
of his own powers of drawing limbs and trunks: and
having resolved, and made the world of his day believe,
that all the glory of design lay in variety of difficult attitude,
he flings the naked bodies about his ceiling with an upholsterer's
ingenuity of appliance to the corners they could fit,
but with total absence of any legible meaning. Nor do I
suppose that one person in a million, even of those who have
some acquaintance with the earlier masters, takes patience
in the Sistine Chapel to conceive the original design. But
Botticelli's mastership of the works evidently was given to
him as a theologian, even more than as a painter; and the
moment when he came to Rome to receive it, you may hold
for the crisis of the Reformation in Italy. The main effort to
save her priesthood was about to be made by her wisest
Reformer,&mdash;face to face with the head of her Church,&mdash;not
in contest with him, but in the humblest subjection to him;
and in adornment of his own chapel for his own delight, and
more than delight, if it might be.

208. Sandro brings to work, not under him, but with
him, the three other strongest and worthiest men he knows,[Pg 125]
Perugino, Ghirlandajo, and Luca Signorelli. There is evidently
entire fellowship in thought between Botticelli and
Perugino. They two together plan the whole; and Botticelli,
though the master, yields to Perugino the principal place,
the end of the chapter, on which is to be the Assumption of the
Virgin. It was Perugino's favorite subject, done with his
central strength; assuredly the crowning work of his life,
and of lovely Christian art in Europe.

Michael Angelo painted it out, and drew devils and dead
bodies all over the wall instead. But there remains to us,
happily, the series of subjects designed by Botticelli to lead
up to this lost one.

209. He came, I said, not to attack, but to restore the Papal
authority. To show the power of inherited honor, and universal
claim of divine law, in the Jewish and Christian
Church,&mdash;the law delivered first by Moses; then, in final
grace and truth, by Christ.

He designed twelve great pictures, each containing some
twenty figures the size of life, and groups of smaller ones
scarcely to be counted. Twelve pictures,&mdash;six to illustrate
the giving of the law by Moses; and six, the ratification and
completion of it by Christ. Event by event, the jurisprudence
of each dispensation is traced from dawn to close in
this correspondence.


Covenant of Circumcision.
Entrance on his Ministry by Moses.
Moses by the Red Sea.
Delivery of Law on Sinai.
Destruction of Korah.
Death of Moses.
Covenant of Baptism.
Entrance on His Ministry by Christ.
Peter and Andrew by the Sea of Galilee.
Sermon on Mount.
Giving Keys to St. Peter.
Last Supper.


Of these pictures, Sandro painted three himself, Perugino
three, and the Assumption; Ghirlandajo one, Signorelli one,[Pg 126]
and Rosselli four.[BA] I believe that Sandro intended to take
the roof also, and had sketched out the main succession of its
design; and that the prophets and sibyls which he meant to
paint, he drew first small, and engraved his drawings afterwards,
that some part of the work might be, at all events, thus
communicable to the world outside of the Vatican.

210. It is not often that I tell you my beliefs; but I am
forced here, for there are no dates to found more on. Is
it not wonderful that among all the infinite mass of fools'
thoughts about the "majestic works of Michael Angelo" in
the Sistine Chapel, no slightly more rational person has ever
asked what the chapel was first meant to be like, and how
it was to be roofed?

Nor can I assume myself, still less you, that all these
prophets and sibyls are Botticelli's. Of many there are two
engravings, with variations: some are inferior in parts, many
altogether. He signed none; never put grand tablets with
'S. B.' into his skies; had other letters than those to engrave,
and no time to spare. I have chosen out of the series three
of the sibyls, which have, I think, clear internal evidence of
being his; and these you shall compare with Michael Angelo's.
But first I must put you in mind what the sibyls were.

211. As the prophets represent the voice of God in man,
the sibyls represent the voice of God in nature. They are
properly all forms of one sibyl, &#916;&#953;&#959;&#962; &#914;&#959;&#965;&#955;&#951;, the counsel of God;
and the chief one, at least in the Roman mind, was the Sibyl
of Cumae. From the traditions of her, the Romans, and we
through them, received whatever lessons the myth, or fact, of
sibyl power has given to mortals.

How much have you received, or may you yet receive, think
you, of that teaching? I call it the myth, or fact; but remember
that, as a myth, it is a fact. This story has concentrated
whatever good there is in the imagination or visionary
powers in women, inspired by nature only. The traditions
of witch and gypsy are partly its offshoots. You despise both,
perhaps. But can you, though in utmost pride of your su[Pg 127]preme
modern wisdom, suppose that the character&mdash;say, even
of so poor and far-fallen a sibyl as Meg Merrilies&mdash;is only
the coinage of Scott's brain; or that, even being no more, it
is valueless? Admit the figure of the Cumaean Sibyl, in
like manner, to be the coinage only of Virgil's brain. As
such, it, and the words it speaks, are yet facts in which we
may find use, if we are reverent to them.

To me, personally, (I must take your indulgence for a moment
to speak wholly of myself,) they have been of the truest
service&mdash;quite material and indisputable.

I am writing on St. John's Day, in the monastery of Assisi;
and I had no idea whatever, when I sat down to my work
this morning, of saying any word of what I am now going to
tell you. I meant only to expand and explain a little what I
said in my lecture about the Florentine engraving. But it
seems to me now that I had better tell you what the Cumaean
Sibyl has actually done for me.

212. In 1871, partly in consequence of chagrin at the Revolution
in Paris, and partly in great personal sorrow, I was
struck by acute inflammatory illness at Matlock, and reduced
to a state of extreme weakness; lying at one time unconscious
for some hours, those about me having no hope of my life.
I have no doubt that the immediate cause of the illness was
simply, eating when I was not hungry; so that modern science
would acknowledge nothing in the whole business but an extreme
and very dangerous form of indigestion; and entirely
deny any interference of the Cumaean Sibyl in the matter.

I once heard a sermon by Dr. Guthrie, in Edinburgh, upon
the wickedness of fasting. It was very eloquent and ingenious,
and finely explained the superiority of the Scotch Free
Church to the benighted Catholic Church, in that the Free
Church saw no merit in fasting. And there was no mention,
from beginning to end of the sermon, of even the existence of
such texts as Daniel i. 12, or Matthew vi. 16.

Without the smallest merit, I admit, in fasting, I was
nevertheless reduced at Matlock to a state very near starvation;
and could not rise from my pillow, without being lifted,[Pg 128]
for some days. And in the first clearly pronounced stage of
recovery, when the perfect powers of spirit had returned,
while the body was still as weak as it well could be, I had
three dreams, which made a great impression on me; for in
ordinary health my dreams are supremely ridiculous, if not
unpleasant; and in ordinary conditions of illness, very ugly,
and always without the slightest meaning. But these dreams
were all distinct and impressive, and had much meaning, if
I chose to take it.

213. The first[BB] was of a Venetian fisherman, who wanted
me to follow him down into some water which I thought was
too deep; but he called me on, saying he had something to
show me; so I followed him; and presently, through an opening,
as if in the arsenal wall, he showed me the bronze horses
of St. Mark's, and said, 'See, the horses are putting on their
harness.'

The second was of a preparation at Rome, in St. Peter's,
(or a vast hall as large as St. Peter's,) for the exhibition of
a religious drama. Part of the play was to be a scene in
which demons were to appear in the sky; and the stage
servants were arranging gray fictitious clouds, and painted
fiends, for it, under the direction of the priests. There was
a woman dressed in black, standing at the corner of the stage
watching them, having a likeness in her face to one of my own
dead friends; and I knew somehow that she was not that
friend, but a spirit; and she made me understand, without
speaking, that I was to watch, for the play would turn out
other than the priests expected. And I waited; and when
the scene came on, the clouds became real clouds, and the
fiends real fiends, agitating them in slow quivering, wild and
terrible, over the heads of the people and priests. I recollected
distinctly, however, when I woke, only the figure of the
black woman mocking the people, and of one priest in an
agony of terror, with the sweat pouring from his brow, but
violently scolding one of the stage servants for having failed[Pg 129]
in some ceremony, the omission of which, he thought, had
given the devils their power.

The third dream was the most interesting and personal.
Some one came to me to ask me to help in the deliverance of
a company of Italian prisoners who were to be ransomed for
money. I said I had no money. They answered, Yes, I
had some that belonged to me as a brother of St. Francis, if
I would give it up. I said I did not know even that I was
a brother of St. Francis; but I thought to myself, that perhaps
the Franciscans of F&eacute;sole, whom I had helped to make
hay in their field in 1845, had adopted me for one; only I
didn't see how the consequence of that would be my having
any money. However, I said they were welcome to whatever
I had; and then I heard the voice of an Italian woman singing;
and I have never heard such divine singing before nor
since;&mdash;the sounds absolutely strong and real, and the melody
altogether lovely. If I could have written it! But I could
not even remember it when I woke,&mdash;only how beautiful it
was.

214. Now these three dreams have, every one of them, been
of much use to me since; or so far as they have failed to be
useful, it has been my own fault, and not theirs; but the chief
use of them at the time was to give me courage and confidence
in myself, both in bodily distress, of which I had still not a
little to bear; and worse, much mental anxiety about matters
supremely interesting to me, which were turning out ill.
And through all such trouble&mdash;which came upon me as I was
recovering, as if it meant to throw me back into the grave,&mdash;I
held out and recovered, repeating always to myself, or rather
having always murmured in my ears, at every new trial, one
Latin line,


Tu ne cede malis, sed contra fortior ito.


Now I had got this line out of the tablet in the engraving of
Raphael's vision, and had forgotten where it came from.
And I thought I knew my sixth book of Virgil so well, that
I never looked at it again while I was giving these lectures[Pg 130]
at Oxford, and it was only here at Assisi, the other day, wanting
to look more accurately at the first scene by the lake Avernus,
that I found I had been saved by the words of the
Cumaean Sibyl.

215. "Quam tua te Fortuna sinet," the completion of the
sentence, has yet more and continual teaching in it for me
now; as it has for all men. Her opening words, which have
become hackneyed, and lost all present power through vulgar
use of them, contain yet one of the most immortal truths ever
yet spoken for mankind; and they will never lose their power
of help for noble persons. But observe, both in that lesson,
"Facilis descensus Averni," etc.; and in the still more precious,
because universal, one on which the strength of Rome
was founded,&mdash;the burning of the books,&mdash;the Sibyl speaks
only as the voice of Nature, and of her laws;&mdash;not as a divine
helper, prevailing over death; but as a mortal teacher warning
us against it, and strengthening us for our mortal time;
but not for eternity. Of which lesson her own history is a
part, and her habitation by the Avernus lake. She desires
immortality, fondly and vainly, as we do ourselves. She receives,
from the love of her refused lover, Apollo, not immortality,
but length of life;&mdash;her years to be as the grains of
dust in her hand. And even this she finds was a false desire;
and her wise and holy desire at last is&mdash;to die. She wastes
away; becomes a shade only, and a voice. The Nations ask
her, What wouldst thou? She answers, Peace; only let my
last words be true. "L'ultimo mie parlar sie verace."





VII.
For a time, and times.


216. Therefore, if anything is to be conceived, rightly,
and chiefly, in the form of the Cumaean Sibyl, it must be of
fading virginal beauty, of enduring patience, of far-looking
into futurity. "For after my death there shall yet return,"
she says, "another virgin."


Jam redit et virgo;&mdash;redeunt Saturnia regna,
Ultima Cumaei venit jam carminis aetas.


Here then is Botticelli's Cumaean Sibyl. She is armed, for
she is the prophetess of Roman fortitude;&mdash;but her faded[Pg 131]
breast scarcely raises the corselet; her hair floats, not falls, in
waves like the currents of a river,&mdash;the sign of enduring life;
the light is full on her forehead: she looks into the distance
as in a dream. It is impossible for art to gather together
more beautifully or intensely every image which can express
her true power, or lead us to understand her lesson.





VIII.
The Nymph beloved of Apollo.
(MICHAEL ANGELO.)


217. Now you do not, I am well assured, know one of
Michael Angelo's sibyls from another: unless perhaps the
Delphian, whom of course he makes as beautiful as he can.
But of this especially Italian prophetess, one would have
thought he might, at least in some way, have shown that he
knew the history, even if he did not understand it. She
might have had more than one book, at all events, to burn.
She might have had a stray leaf or two fallen at her feet.
He could not indeed have painted her only as a voice; but his
anatomical knowledge need not have hindered him from
painting her virginal youth, or her wasting and watching
age, or her inspired hope of a holier future.

218. Opposite,&mdash;fortunately, photograph from the figure
itself, so that you can suspect me of no exaggeration,&mdash;is
Michael Angelo's Cumaean Sibyl, wasting away. It is by a
grotesque and most strange chance that he should have made
the figure of this Sibyl, of all others in the chapel, the most
fleshly and gross, even proceeding to the monstrous license of
showing the nipples of the breast as if the dress were molded
over them like plaster. Thus he paints the poor nymph beloved
of Apollo,&mdash;the clearest and queenliest in prophecy and
command of all the sibyls,&mdash;as an ugly crone, with the arms
of Goliath, poring down upon a single book.

219. There is one point of fine detail, however, in Botticelli's
Cumaean Sibyl, and in the next I am going to show
you, to explain which I must go back for a little while to the
question of the direct relation of the Italian painters to the
Greek. I don't like repeating in one lecture what I have said
in another; but to save you the trouble of reference, must remind
you of what I stated in my fourth lecture on Greek
birds, when we were examining the adoption of the plume[Pg 132]
crests in armor, that the crest signifies command; but the diadem,
obedience; and that every crown is primarily a diadem.
It is the thing that binds, before it is the thing that honors.

Now all the great schools dwell on this symbolism. The
long flowing hair is the symbol of life, and the &#948;&#953;&#940;&#948;&#951;&#956;&#945; of the
law restraining it. Royalty, or kingliness, over life, restraining
and glorifying. In the extremity of restraint&mdash;in
death, whether noble, as of death to Earth, or ignoble, as of
death to Heaven, the &#948;&#953;&#940;&#948;&#951;&#956;&#945; is fastened with the mort-cloth:
"Bound hand and foot with grave-clothes, and the face bound
about with the napkin."

220. Now look back to the first Greek head I ever showed
you, used as the type of archaic sculpture in Aratra Pentelici,
and then look at the crown in Botticelli's Astrologia. It is
absolutely the Greek form,&mdash;even to the peculiar oval of the
forehead; while the diadem&mdash;the governing law&mdash;is set with
appointed stars&mdash;to rule the destiny and thought. Then return
to the Cumaean Sibyl. She, as we have seen, is the symbol
of enduring life&mdash;almost immortal. The diadem is withdrawn
from the forehead&mdash;reduced to a narrow fillet&mdash;here,
and the hair thrown free.





IX.
In the woods of Ida.


221. From the Cumaean Sibyl's diadem, traced only by
points, turn to that of the Hellespontic, (Plate 9, opposite).
I do not know why Botticelli chose her for the spirit of prophecy
in old age; but he has made this the most interesting
plate of the series in the definiteness of its connection with
the work from Dante, which becomes his own prophecy in old
age. The fantastic yet solemn treatment of the gnarled wood
occurs, as far as I know, in no other engravings but this, and
the illustrations to Dante; and I am content to leave it, with
little comment, for the reader's quiet study, as showing the
exuberance of imagination which other men at this time in
Italy allowed to waste itself in idle arabesque, restrained by
Botticelli to his most earnest purposes; and giving the withered
tree-trunks, hewn for the rude throne of the aged prophetess,
the same harmony with her fading spirit which the
rose has with youth, or the laurel with victory. Also in its[Pg 133]
weird characters, you have the best example I can show you
of the orders of decorative design which are especially expressible
by engraving, and which belong to a group of art instincts
scarcely now to be understood, much less recovered,
(the influence of modern naturalistic imitation being too
strong to be conquered)&mdash;the instincts, namely, for the arrangement
of pure line, in labyrinthine intricacy, through
which the grace of order may give continual clue. The entire
body of ornamental design, connected with writing, in the
Middle Ages seems as if it were a sensible symbol, to the eye
and brain, of the methods of error and recovery, the minglings
of crooked with straight, and perverse with progressive, which
constitute the great problem of human morals and fate; and
when I chose the title for the collected series of these lectures,
I hoped to have justified it by careful analysis of the methods
of labyrinthine ornament, which, made sacred by Theseian
traditions,[BC] and beginning, in imitation of physical truth,
with the spiral waves of the waters of Babylon as the Assyrian
carved them, entangled in their returns the eyes of men,
on Greek vase and Christian manuscript&mdash;till they closed in
the arabesques which sprang round the last luxury of Venice
and Rome.

But the labyrinth of life itself, and its more and more interwoven
occupation, become too manifold, and too difficult
for me; and of the time wasted in the blind lanes of it, perhaps
that spent in analysis or recommendation of the art to
which men's present conduct makes them insensible, has been
chiefly cast away. On the walls of the little room where I
finally revise this lecture,[BD] hangs an old silken sampler of
great-grandame's work: representing the domestic life of
Abraham: chiefly the stories of Isaac and Ishmael. Sarah
at her tent-door, watching, with folded arms, the dismissal of
Hagar: above, in a wilderness full of fruit trees, birds, and
butterflies, little Ishmael lying at the root of a tree, and the
spent bottle under another; Hagar in prayer, and the angel[Pg 134]
appearing to her out of a wreathed line of gloomily undulating
clouds, which, with a dark-rayed sun in the midst, surmount
the entire composition in two arches, out of which descend
shafts of (I suppose) beneficent rain; leaving, however,
room, in the corner opposite to Ishmael's angel, for Isaac's,
who stays Abraham in the sacrifice; the ram in the thicket,
the squirrel in the plum tree above him, and the grapes, pears,
apples, roses, and daisies of the foreground, being all wrought
with involution of such ingenious needlework as may well
rank, in the patience, the natural skill, and the innocent
pleasure of it, with the truest works of Florentine engraving.
Nay; the actual tradition of many of the forms of ancient art
is in many places evident,&mdash;as, for instance, in the spiral
summits of the flames of the wood on the altar, which are like
a group of first-springing fern. On the wall opposite is a
smaller composition, representing Justice with her balance
and sword, standing between the sun and moon, with a background
of pinks, borage, and corn-cockle: a third is only a
cluster of tulips and iris, with two Byzantine peacocks; but
the spirits of Penelope and Ariadne reign vivid in all the
work&mdash;and the richness of pleasurable fancy is as great still,
in these silken labors, as in the marble arches and golden roof
of the cathedral of Monreale.

But what is the use of explaining or analyzing it? Such
work as this means the patience and simplicity of all feminine
life; and can be produced, among us at least, no more. Gothic
tracery itself, another of the instinctive labyrinthine intricacies
of old, though analyzed to its last section, has become now
the symbol only of a foolish ecclesiastical sect, retained for
their shibboleth, joyless and powerless for all good. The
very labyrinth of the grass and flowers of our fields, though
dissected to its last leaf, is yet bitten bare, or trampled to
slime, by the Minotaur of our lust; and for the traceried spire
of the poplar by the brook, we possess but the four-square furnace
tower, to mingle its smoke with heaven's thunder-clouds.[BE][Pg 135]

We will look yet at one sampler more of the engraved work,
done in the happy time when flowers were pure, youth simple,
and imagination gay,&mdash;Botticelli's Libyan Sibyl.

Glance back first to the Hellespontic, noting the close fillet,
and the cloth bound below the face, and then you will be prepared
to understand the last I shall show you, and the loveliest
of the southern Pythonesses.





X.
Grass of the Desert.


222. A less deep thinker than Botticelli would have made
her parched with thirst, and burnt with heat. But the voice
of God, through nature, to the Arab or the Moor, is not in the
thirst, but in the fountain&mdash;not in the desert, but in the grass
of it. And this Libyan Sibyl is the spirit of wild grass and
flowers, springing in desolate places.

You see, her diadem is a wreath of them; but the blossoms
of it are not fastening enough for her hair, though it is not
long yet&mdash;(she is only in reality a Florentine girl of fourteen
or fifteen)&mdash;so the little darling knots it under her ears, and
then makes herself a necklace of it. But though flowing hair
and flowers are wild and pretty, Botticelli had not, in these
only, got the power of Spring marked to his mind. Any girl
might wear flowers; but few, for ornament, would be likely
to wear grass. So the Sibyl shall have grass in her diadem;
not merely interwoven and bending, but springing and strong.
You thought it ugly and grotesque at first, did not you? It
was made so, because precisely what Botticelli wanted you to
look at.

But that's not all. This conical cap of hers, with one bead
at the top,&mdash;considering how fond the Florentines are of
graceful head-dresses, this seems a strange one for a young
girl. But, exactly as I know the angel of Victory to be
Greek, at his Mount of Pity, so I know this head-dress to be[Pg 136]
taken from a Greek coin, and to be meant for a Greek symbol.
It is the Petasus of Hermes&mdash;the mist of morning over
the dew. Lastly, what will the Libyan Sibyl say to you?
The letters are large on her tablet. Her message is the oracle
from the temple of the Dew: "The dew of thy birth is as the
womb of the morning."&mdash;"Ecce venientem diem, et latentia
aperientem, tenebit gremio gentium regina."

223. Why the daybreak came not then, nor yet has come,
but only a deeper darkness; and why there is now neither
queen nor king of nations, but every man doing that which
is right in his own eyes, I would fain go on, partly to tell
you, and partly to meditate with you: but it is not our work
for to-day. The issue of the Reformation which these great
painters, the scholars of Dante, began, we may follow, farther,
in the study to which I propose to lead you, of the lives of
Cimabue and Giotto, and the relation of their work at Assisi
to the chapel and chambers of the Vatican.

224. To-day let me finish what I have to tell you of the
style of southern engraving. What sudden bathos in the sentence,
you think! So contemptible the question of style,
then, in painting, though not in literature? You study the
'style' of Homer; the style, perhaps, of Isaiah; the style of
Horace, and of Massillon. Is it so vain to study the style of
Botticelli?

In all cases, it is equally vain, if you think of their style
first. But know their purpose, and then, their way of speaking
is worth thinking of. These apparently unfinished and
certainly unfilled outlines of the Florentine,&mdash;clumsy work,
as Vasari thought them,&mdash;as Mr. Otley and most of our
English amateurs still think them,&mdash;are these good or bad
engraving?

You may ask now, comprehending their motive, with some
hope of answering or being answered rightly. And the answer
is, They are the finest gravers' work ever done yet by
human hand. You may teach, by process of discipline and
of years, any youth of good artistic capacity to engrave a
plate in the modern manner; but only the noblest passion,[Pg 137]
and the tenderest patience, will ever engrave one line like
these of Sandro Botticelli.

225. Passion, and patience! Nay, even these you may
have to-day in England, and yet both be in vain. Only a
few years ago, in one of our northern iron-foundries, a workman
of intense power and natural art-faculty set himself to
learn engraving;&mdash;made his own tools; gave all the spare
hours of his laborious life to learn their use; learnt it; and
engraved a plate which, in manipulation, no professional engraver
would be ashamed of. He engraved his blast furnace,
and the casting of a beam of a steam engine. This, to him,
was the power of God,&mdash;it was his life. No greater earnestness
was ever given by man to promulgate a Gospel. Nevertheless,
the engraving is absolutely worthless. The blast furnace
is not the power of God; and the life of the strong spirit
was as much consumed in the flames of it, as ever driven
slave's by the burden and heat of the day.

How cruel to say so, if he yet lives, you think! No, my
friends; the cruelty will be in you, and the guilt, if, having
been brought here to learn that God is your Light, you yet
leave the blast furnace to be the only light of England.

226. It has been, as I said in the note above (&sect; 200), with
extreme pain that I have hitherto limited my notice of our
own great engraver and moralist, to the points in which the
disadvantages of English art-teaching made him inferior to
his trained Florentine rival. But, that these disadvantages
were powerless to arrest or ignobly depress him;&mdash;that however
failing in grace and scholarship, he should never fail in
truth or vitality; and that the precision of his unerring hand[BF]&mdash;his
inevitable eye&mdash;and his rightly judging heart&mdash;should
place him in the first rank of the great artists not of England
only, but of all the world and of all time:&mdash;that this was
possible to him, was simply because he lived a country life.[Pg 138]
Bewick himself, Botticelli himself, Apelles himself, and
twenty times Apelles, condemned to slavery in the hell-fire of
the iron furnace, could have done&mdash;Nothing. Absolute
paralysis of all high human faculty must result from labor
near fire. The poor engraver of the piston-rod had faculties&mdash;not
like Bewick's, for if he had had those, he never would
have endured the degradation; but assuredly, (I know this
by his work,) faculties high enough to have made him one of
the most accomplished figure painters of his age. And they
are scorched out of him, as the sap from the grass in the oven:
while on his Northumberland hill-sides, Bewick grew into as
stately life as their strongest pine.

227. And therefore, in words of his, telling consummate
and unchanging truth concerning the life, honor, and happiness
of England, and bearing directly on the points of difference
between class and class which I have not dwelt on
without need, I will bring these lectures to a close.

"I have always, through life, been of opinion that there is
no business of any kind that can be compared to that of a man
who farms his own land. It appears to me that every earthly
pleasure, with health, is within his reach. But numbers of
these men (the old statesmen) were grossly ignorant, and in
exact proportion to that ignorance they were sure to be offensively
proud. This led them to attempt appearing above
their station, which hastened them on to their ruin; but, indeed,
this disposition and this kind of conduct invariably
leads to such results. There were many of these lairds on
Tyneside; as well as many who held their lands on the tenure
of 'suit and service,' and were nearly on the same level as
the lairds. Some of the latter lost their lands (not fairly, I
think) in a way they could not help; many of the former, by
their misdirected pride and folly, were driven into towns, to
slide away into nothingness, and to sink into oblivion, while
their 'ha' houses' (halls), that ought to have remained in
their families from generation to generation, have moldered
away. I have always felt extremely grieved to see the ancient
mansions of many of the country gentlemen, from some[Pg 139]what
similar causes, meet with a similar fate. The gentry
should, in an especial manner, prove by their conduct that
they are guarded against showing any symptom of foolish
pride; at the same time that they soar above every meanness,
and that their conduct is guided by truth, integrity, and
patriotism. If they wish the people to partake with them
in these good qualities, they must set them the example, without
which no real respect can ever be paid to them. Gentlemen
ought never to forget the respectable station they hold
in society, and that they are the natural guardians of public
morals and may with propriety be considered as the head and
the heart of the country, while 'a bold peasantry' are, in
truth, the arms, the sinews, and the strength of the same; but
when these last are degraded, they soon become dispirited and
mean, and often dishonest and useless."



"This singular and worthy man[BG] was perhaps the most[Pg 140]
invaluable acquaintance and friend I ever met with. His
moral lectures and advice to me formed a most important
succedaneum to those imparted by my parents. His wise remarks,
his detestation of vice, his industry, and his temperance,
crowned with a most lively and cheerful disposition, altogether
made him appear to me as one of the best of characters.
In his workshop I often spent my winter evenings.
This was also the case with a number of young men who
might be considered as his pupils; many of whom, I have no
doubt, he directed into the paths of truth and integrity, and
who revered his memory through life. He rose early to work,
lay down when he felt weary, and rose again when refreshed.
His diet was of the simplest kind; and he ate when hungry,
and drank when dry, without paying regard to meal-times.
By steadily pursuing this mode of life he was enabled to accumulate
sums of money&mdash;from ten to thirty pounds. This
enabled him to get books, of an entertaining and moral tendency,
printed and circulated at a cheap rate. His great object
was, by every possible means, to promote honorable feelings
in the minds of youth, and to prepare them for becoming
good members of society. I have often discovered that he
did not overlook ingenious mechanics, whose misfortunes&mdash;perhaps
mismanagement&mdash;had led them to a lodging in Newgate.
To these he directed his compassionate eye, and for
the deserving (in his estimation), he paid their debt, and set
them at liberty. He felt hurt at seeing the hands of an ingenious
man tied up in prison, where they were of no use either
to himself or to the community. This worthy man had been[Pg 141]
educated for a priest; but he would say to me, 'Of a "trouth,"
Thomas, I did not like their ways.' So he gave up the
thoughts of being a priest, and bent his way from Aberdeen
to Edinburgh, where he engaged himself to Allan Ramsay,
the poet, then a bookseller at the latter place, in whose service
he was both shopman and bookbinder. From Edinburgh
he came to Newcastle. Gilbert had had a liberal education
bestowed upon him. He had read a great deal, and had reflected
upon what he had read. This, with his retentive
memory, enabled him to be a pleasant and communicative
companion. I lived in habits of intimacy with him to the
end of his life; and, when he died, I, with others of his
friends, attended his remains to the grave at the Ballast
Hills."

And what graving on the sacred cliffs of Egypt ever honored
them, as that grass-dimmed furrow does the mounds of
our Northern land?

where they only lusted; and he has been proclaimed therefore by them&mdash;and
too foolishly believed by us&mdash;to have been a shameful person.

motive.) If the dirty creatures did want to make smoke, there
would be more excuse for them: and that they are not clever enough
to consume it, is no praise to them. A man who can't help his hiccough
leaves the room: why do they not leave the England they pollute?

[BF] I know no drawing so subtle as Bewick's, since the fifteenth century,
except Holbein's and Turner's. I have been greatly surprised
lately by the exquisite water-color work in some of Stothard's smaller
vignettes; but he cannot set the line like Turner or Bewick.

[BG] Gilbert Gray, bookbinder. I have to correct the inaccurate&mdash;and
very harmfully inaccurate, expression which I used of Bewick, in Love's
Meinie (&sect; 3), 'a printer's lad at Newcastle.' His first master was a goldsmith
and engraver, else he could never have been an artist. I am
very heartily glad to make this correction, which establishes another
link of relation between Bewick and Botticelli; but my error was
partly caused by the impression which the above description of his
"most invaluable friend" made on me, when I first read it.

Much else that I meant to correct, or promised to explain, in this
lecture, must be deferred to the Appendix; the superiority of the Tuscan
to the Greek Aphrodite I may perhaps, even at last, leave the
reader to admit or deny as he pleases, having more important matters
of debate on hand. But as I mean only to play with Proserpina during
the spring, I will here briefly anticipate a statement I mean in the
Appendix to enforce, namely, of the extreme value of colored copies
by hand, of paintings whose excellence greatly consists in color, as
auxiliary to engravings of them. The prices now given without hesitation
for nearly worthless original drawings by fifth-rate artists, would
obtain for the misguided buyers, in something like a proportion of ten
to one, most precious copies of drawings which can only be represented
at all in engraving by entire alteration of their treatment, and abandonment
of their finest purposes. I feel this so strongly that I have given
my best attention, during upwards of ten years, to train a copyist to
perfect fidelity in rendering the work of Turner; and having now succeeded
in enabling him to produce facsimiles so close as to look like
replicas, facsimiles which I must sign with my own name and his, in the
very work of them, to prevent their being sold for real Turner vignettes,
I can obtain no custom for him, and am obliged to leave him to make his
bread by any power of captivation his original sketches may possess in
the eyes of a public which maintains a nation of copyists in Rome, but
is content with black and white renderings of great English art; though
there is scarcely one cultivated English gentleman or lady who has not
been twenty times in the Vatican, for once that they have been in the
National Gallery.

NOTES.


228. I. The following letter, from one of my most faithful
readers, corrects an important piece of misinterpretation
in the text. The waving of the reins must be only in sign of
the fluctuation of heat round the Sun's own chariot:&mdash;

"Spring Field, Ambleside,&nbsp;&nbsp;
"February 11, 1875.

"Dear Mr. Ruskin,&mdash;Your fifth lecture on Engraving I
have to hand.

"Sandro intended those wavy lines meeting under the
Sun's right[BH] hand, (Plate V.) primarily, no doubt, to represent
the four ends of the four reins dangling from the
Sun's hand. The flames and rays are seen to continue to
radiate from the platform of the chariot between and beyond
these ends of the reins, and over the knee. He may have
wanted to acknowledge that the warmth of the earth was
Apollo's, by making these ends of the reins spread out separately
and wave, and thereby inclose a form like a flame.
But I cannot think it.

"Believe me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ever yours truly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Chas. Wm. Smith."

II. I meant to keep labyrinthine matters for my Appendix;
but the following most useful by-words from Mr. Tyrwhitt
had better be read at once:&mdash;

"In the matter of Cretan Labyrinth, as connected by[Pg 144]
Virgil with the Ludus Troj&aelig;, or equestrian game of winding
and turning, continued in England from twelfth century;
and having for last relic the maze[BI] called 'Troy Town,' at
Troy Farm, near Somerton, Oxfordshire, which itself resembles
the circular labyrinth on a coin of Cnossus in Fors
Clavigera. (Letter 23, p. 12.)

"The connecting quotation from Virg., &AElig;n., V. 588, is as
follows:


'Ut quondam Creta fertur Labyrinthus in alta
Parietibus textum c&aelig;cis iter, ancipitemque
Mille viis habuisse dolum, qua signa sequendi
Falleret indeprensus et inremeabilis error.
Haud alio Teucr&uuml;n nati vestigia cursu
Impediunt, texuntque fagas et pr&oelig;lia ludo,
Delphinum similes.'"


Labyrinth of Ariadne, as cut on the Downs by shepherds
from time immemorial,&mdash;

Shakespeare, 'Midsummer Night's Dream,' Act ii., sc. 2:


"Oberon. The nine-men's morris[BJ] is filled up with mud;
And the quaint mazes in the wanton green
By lack of tread are undistinguishable."


The following passage, 'Merchant of Venice,' Act iii., sc.
2, confuses (to all appearance) the Athenian tribute to Crete,
with the story of Hesione: and may point to general confusion
in the Elizabethan mind about the myths:


"Portia. ... with much more love
Than young Alcides, when he did reduce
The virgin-tribute paid by howling Troy
To the sea monster."[BK]


Theseus is the Attic Hercules, however; and Troy may
have been a sort of house of call for mythical monsters, in
the view of midland shepherds.

FOOTNOTES:

[BH] "Would not the design have looked better, to us, on the plate than
on the print? On the plate, the reins would be in the left hand; and
the whole movement be from the left to the right? The two different
forms that the radiance takes would symbolize respectively heat and
light, would they not?"

etc., in the midland counties.

APPENDIX.

ARTICLE I.

NOTES ON THE PRESENT STATE OF ENGRAVING IN ENGLAND.

229. I have long deferred the completion of this book, because
I had hoped to find time to show, in some fullness, the
grounds for my conviction that engraving, and the study of
it, since the development of the modern finished school, have
been ruinous to European knowledge of art. But I am more
and more busied in what I believe to be better work, and can
only with extreme brevity state here the conclusions of many
years' thought.

These, in several important particulars, have been curiously
enforced on me by the carelessness shown by the picture
dealers about the copies from Turner which it has cost
Mr. Ward and me[BL] fifteen years of study together to enable
ourselves to make. "They are only copies," say they,&mdash;"nobody
will look at them."

230. It never seems to occur even to the most intelligent
persons that an engraving also is 'only a copy,' and a copy
done with refusal of color, and with disadvantage of means in
rendering shade. But just because this utterly inferior copy
can be reduplicated, and introduces a different kind of skill,
in another material, people are content to lose all the composition,
and all the charm, of the original,&mdash;so far as these
depend on the chief gift of a painter,&mdash;color; while they are
gradually misled into attributing to the painter himself qualities
impertinently added by the engraver to make his plate[Pg 146]
popular: and, which is far worse, they are as gradually and
subtly prevented from looking, in the original, for the qualities
which engraving could never render. Further, it continually
happens that the very best color-compositions engrave
worst; for they often extend colors over great spaces at equal
pitch, and the green is as dark as the red, and the blue as the
brown; so that the engraver can only distinguish them by
lines in different directions, and his plate becomes a vague
and dead mass of neutral tint; but a bad and forced piece of
color, or a piece of work of the Bolognese school, which is
everywhere black in the shadows, and colorless in the lights,
will engrave with great ease, and appear spirited and forcible.
Hence engravers, as a rule, are interested in reproducing
the work of the worst schools of painting.

Also, the idea that the merit of an engraving consisted in
light and shade, has prevented the modern masters from even
attempting to render works dependent mainly on outline and
expression; like the early frescoes, which should indeed have
been the objects of their most attentive and continual skill:
for outline and expression are entirely within the scope of engraving;
and the scripture histories of an aisle of a cloister
might have been engraved, to perfection, with little more
pains than are given by ordinary workmen to round a limb
by Correggio, or imitate the texture of a dress by Sir Joshua,&mdash;and
both, at last, inadequately.

231. I will not lose more time in asserting or lamenting
the mischief arising out of the existing system: but will
rapidly state what the public should now ask for.

1. Exquisitely careful engraved outlines of all remaining
frescoes of the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth centuries
in Italy, with so much pale tinting as may be explanatory of
their main masses; and with the local darks and local lights
brilliantly relieved. The Arundel Society have published
some meritorious plates of this kind from Angelico,&mdash;not,
however, paying respect enough to the local colors, but conventionalizing
the whole too much into outline.

2. Finished small plates for book illustration. The cheap[Pg 147]
wood-cutting and etching of popular illustrated books have
been endlessly mischievous to public taste: they first obtained
their power in a general reaction of the public mind from the
insipidity of the lower school of line engraving, brought on it
by servile persistence in hack work for ignorant publishers.
The last dregs of it may still be seen in the sentimental landscapes
engraved for cheap ladies' pocket-books. But the
woodcut can never, educationally, take the place of serene
and accomplished line engraving; and the training of young
artists in whom the gift of delineation prevails over their
sense of color, to the production of scholarly, but small plates,
with their utmost honor of skill, would give a hitherto unconceived
dignity to the character and range of our popular
literature.

3. Vigorous mezzotints from pictures of the great masters,
which originally present noble contrasts of light and
shade. Many Venetian works are magnificent in this character.

4. Original design by painters themselves, decisively engraved
in few lines&mdash;(not etched); and with such insistence
by dotted work on the main contours as we have seen in the
examples given from Italian engraving.

5. On the other hand, the men whose quiet patience and
exquisite manual dexterity are at present employed in producing
large and costly plates, such as that of the Belle Jardini&egrave;re
de Florence, by M. Boucher Desnoyers, should be entirely
released from their servile toil, and employed exclusively
in producing colored copies, or light drawings, from
the original work. The same number of hours of labor, applied
with the like conscientious skill, would multiply precious
likenesses of the real picture, full of subtle veracities
which no steel line could approach, and conveying, to thousands,
true knowledge and unaffected enjoyment of painting;
while the finished plate lies uncared for in the portfolio of the
virtuoso, serving only, so far as it is seen in the printseller's
window by the people, to make them think that sacred painting
must always be dull, and unnatural.[Pg 148]

232. I have named the above engraving, because, for persons
wishing to study the present qualities and methods of
line-work, it is a pleasant and sufficient possession, uniting
every variety of texture with great serenity of unforced effect,
and exhibiting every possible artifice and achievement in the
distribution of even and rugged, or of close and open line;
artifices for which,&mdash;while I must yet once more and emphatically
repeat that they are illegitimate, and could not be
practiced in a revived school of classic art,&mdash;I would fain secure
the reader's reverent admiration, under the conditions exacted
by the school to which they belong. Let him endeavor,
with the finest point of pen or pencil he can obtain, to imitate
the profile of this Madonna in its relief against the gray background
of the water surface; let him examine, through a good
lens, the way in which the lines of the background are ended
in a lance-point as they approach it; the exact equality of
depth of shade being restored by inserted dots, which prepare
for the transition to the manner of shade adopted in the flesh:
then let him endeavor to trace with his own hand some of the
curved lines at the edge of the eyelid, or in the rounding of
the lip; or if these be too impossible, even a few of the quiet
undulations which gradate the folds of the hood behind the
hair; and he will, I trust, begin to comprehend the range of
delightful work which would be within the reach of such an
artist, employed with more tractable material on more
extended subject.

233. If, indeed, the present system were capable of influencing
the mass of the people, and enforcing among them the
subtle attention necessary to appreciate it, something might
be pleaded in defense of its severity. But all these plates
are entirely above the means of the lower middle classes, and
perhaps not one reader in a hundred can possess himself, for
the study I ask of him, even of the plate to which I have just
referred. What, in the stead of such, he can and does possess,
let him consider,&mdash;and, if possible, just after examining the
noble qualities of this conscientious engraving.

234. Take up, for an average specimen of modern illus[Pg 149]trated
works, the volume of Dickens's 'Master Humphrey's
Clock,' containing 'Barnaby Rudge.'

You have in that book an entirely profitless and monstrous
story, in which the principal characters are a coxcomb, an
idiot, a madman, a savage blackguard, a foolish tavern-keeper,
a mean old maid, and a conceited apprentice,&mdash;mixed
up with a certain quantity of ordinary operatic pastoral stuff,
about a pretty Dolly in ribbons, a lover with a wooden leg,
and an heroic locksmith. For these latter, the only elements
of good, or life, in the filthy mass of the story,[BM] observe that
the author must filch the wreck of those old times of which
we fiercely and frantically destroy every living vestige, whenever
it is possible. You cannot have your Dolly Varden
brought up behind the counter of a railway station; nor your
jolly locksmith trained at a Birmingham brass-foundry.
And of these materials, observe that you can only have the
ugly ones illustrated. The cheap popular art cannot draw
for you beauty, sense, or honesty; and for Dolly Varden, or
the locksmith, you will look through the vignettes in vain.
But every species of distorted folly and vice,&mdash;the idiot, the
blackguard, the coxcomb, the paltry fool, the degraded woman,&mdash;are
pictured for your honorable pleasure in every page,
with clumsy caricature, struggling to render its dullness tolerable
by insisting on defect,&mdash;if perchance a penny or two
more may be coined out of the Cockney reader's itch for
loathsomeness.

235. Or take up, for instance of higher effort, the 'Cornhill
Magazine' for this month, July, 1876. It has a vignette
of Venice for an illuminated letter. That is what your decorative
art has become, by help of Kensington! The letter
to be produced is a T. There is a gondola in the front of the
design, with the canopy slipped back to the stern like a saddle
over a horse's tail. There is another in the middle distance,
all gone to seed at the prow, with its gondolier emaciated into[Pg 150]
an oar, at the stern; then there is a Church of the Salute, and
a Ducal Palace,&mdash;in which I beg you to observe all the felicity
and dexterity of modern cheap engraving; finally, over
the Ducal Palace there is something, I know not in the least
what meant for, like an umbrella dropping out of a balloon,
which is the ornamental letter T. Opposite this ornamental
design, there is an engraving of two young ladies and a parasol,
between two trunks of trees. The white face and black
feet of the principal young lady, being the points of the design,
are done with as much care,&mdash;not with as much dexterity,&mdash;as
an ordinary sketch of Du Maurier's in Punch. The
young lady's dress, the next attraction, is done in cheap white
and black cutting, with considerably less skill than that of
any ordinary tailor's or milliner's shop-book pattern drawing.
For the other young lady, and the landscape, take your magnifying
glass, and look at the hacked wood that forms the entire
shaded surface&mdash;one mass of idiotic scrabble, without the
remotest attempt to express a single leaf, flower, or clod of
earth. It is such landscape as the public sees out of its railroad
window at sixty miles of it in the hour&mdash;and good
enough for such a public.

236. Then turn to the last&mdash;the poetical plate, p. 122:
"Lifts her&mdash;lays her down with care." Look at the gentleman
with a spade, promoting the advance, over a hillock of
hay, of the reposing figure in the black-sided tub. Take your
magnifying glass to that, and look what a dainty female arm
and hand your modern scientific and anatomical schools of
art have provided you with! Look at the tender horizontal
flux of the sea round the promontory point above. Look at
the tender engraving of the linear light on the divine horizon,
above the ravenous sea-gull. Here is Development and Progress
for you, from the days of Perugino's horizon, and
Dante's daybreaks! Truly, here it seems


"Si che le bianche e le vermiglie guance
Per troppa etate divenivan rance."


237. I have chosen no gross or mean instances of modern[Pg 151]
work. It is one of the saddest points connected with the
matter that the designer of this last plate is a person of consummate
art faculty, but bound to the wheel of the modern
Juggernaut, and broken on it. These woodcuts, for 'Barnaby
Rudge' and the 'Cornhill Magazine,' are favorably representative
of the entire illustrative art industry of the modern
press,&mdash;industry enslaved to the ghastly service of catching
the last gleams in the glued eyes of the daily more bestial
English mob,&mdash;railroad born and bred, which drags itself
about the black world it has withered under its breath, in one
eternal grind and shriek,&mdash;gobbling,&mdash;staring,&mdash;chattering,&mdash;giggling,&mdash;trampling
out every vestige of national honor
and domestic peace, wherever it sets the staggering hoof of it;
incapable of reading, of hearing, of thinking, of looking,&mdash;capable
only of greed for money, lust for food, pride of dress,
and the prurient itch of momentary curiosity for the politics
last announced by the newsmonger, and the religion last
rolled by the chemist into electuary for the dead.

238. In the miserably competitive labor of finding new
stimulus for the appetite&mdash;daily more gross&mdash;of this tyrannous
mob, we may count as lost, beyond any hope, the artists
who are dull, docile, or distressed enough to submit to its
demands; and we may count the dull and the distressed by
myriads;&mdash;and among the docile, many of the best intellects
we possess. The few who have sense and strength to assert
their own place and supremacy, are driven into discouraged
disease by their isolation, like Turner and Blake; the one
abandoning the design of his 'Liber Studiorum' after imperfectly
and sadly, against total public neglect, carrying it
forward to what it is,&mdash;monumental, nevertheless, in landscape
engraving; the other producing, with one only majestic
series of designs from the book of Job, nothing for his life's
work but coarsely iridescent sketches of enigmatic dream.

239. And, for total result of our English engraving industry
during the last hundred and fifty years, I find that
practically at this moment I cannot get a single piece of true,
sweet, and comprehensible art, to place for instruction in any[Pg 152]
children's school! I can get, for ten pounds apiece, well-engraved
portraits of Sir Joshua's beauties showing graceful
limbs through flowery draperies; I can get&mdash;dirt-cheap&mdash;any
quantity of Dutch flats, ditches, and hedges, enlivened
by cows chewing the cud, and dogs behaving indecently; I
can get heaps upon heaps of temples, and forums, and altars,
arranged as for academical competition, round seaports, with
curled-up ships that only touch the water with the middle of
their bottoms. I can get, at the price of lumber, any quantity
of British squires flourishing whips and falling over hurdles;
and, in suburban shops, a dolorous variety of widowed mothers
nursing babies in a high light with the Bible on a table, and
baby's shoes on a chair. Also, of cheap prints, painted red
and blue, of Christ blessing little children, of Joseph and
his brethren, the infant Samuel, or Daniel in the lions' den,
the supply is ample enough to make every child in these
islands think of the Bible as a somewhat dull story-book,
allowed on Sunday;&mdash;but of trained, wise, and worthy art,
applied to gentle purposes of instruction, no single example
can be found in the shops of the British printseller or bookseller.
And after every dilettante tongue in European
society has filled drawing-room and academy alike with idle
clatter concerning the divinity of Raphael and Michael
Angelo, for these last hundred years, I cannot at this instant,
for the first school which I have some power of organizing
under St. George's laws, get a good print of Raphael's
Madonna of the tribune, or an ordinarily intelligible view of
the side and dome of St. Peter's!

240. And there are simply no words for the mixed absurdity
and wickedness of the present popular demand for art,
as shown by its supply in our thoroughfares. Abroad, in
the shops of the Rue de Rivoli, brightest and most central
of Parisian streets, the putrescent remnant of what was once
Catholicism promotes its poor gilded pedlars' ware of nativity
and crucifixion into such honorable corners as it can find
among the more costly and studious illuminations of the
brothel: and although, in Pall Mall, and the Strand, the[Pg 153]
large-margined Landseer,&mdash;Stanfield,&mdash;or Turner-proofs, in
a few stately windows, still represent, uncared-for by the
people, or inaccessible to them, the power of an English
school now wholly perished,&mdash;these are too surely superseded,
in the windows that stop the crowd, by the thrilling attraction
with which Dor&eacute;, G&eacute;rome, and Tadema have invested the
gambling table, the dueling ground, and the arena; or by the
more material and almost tangible truth with which the apothecary-artist
stereographs the stripped actress, and the railway
mound.

241. Under these conditions, as I have now repeatedly
asserted, no professorship, nor school, of art can be of the
least use to the general public. No race can understand a
visionary landscape, which blasts its real mountains into
ruin, and blackens its river-beds with foam of poison. Nor
is it of the least use to exhibit ideal Diana at Kensington,
while substantial Phryne may be worshiped in the Strand.
The only recovery of our art-power possible,&mdash;nay, when
once we know the full meaning of it, the only one desirable,&mdash;must
result from the purification of the nation's heart,
and chastisement of its life: utterly hopeless now, for our
adult population, or in our large cities, and their neighborhood.
But, so far as any of the sacred influence of former
design can be brought to bear on the minds of the young,
and so far as, in rural districts, the first elements of scholarly
education can be made pure, the foundation of a new dynasty
of thought may be slowly laid. I was strangely impressed
by the effect produced in a provincial seaport school for
children, chiefly of fishermen's families, by the gift of a
little colored drawing of a single figure from the Paradise
of Angelico in the Accademia of Florence. The drawing
was wretched enough, seen beside the original; I had only
bought it from the poor Italian copyist for charity: but, to
the children, it was like an actual glimpse of heaven; they
rejoiced in it with pure joy, and their mistress thanked me
for it more than if I had sent her a whole library of good
books. Of such copies, the grace-giving industry of young[Pg 154]
girls, now worse than lost in the spurious charities of the
bazaar, or selfish ornamentations of the drawing-room, might,
in a year's time, provide enough for every dame-school in
England; and a year's honest work of the engravers employed
on our base novels, might represent to our advanced
students every frescoed legend of philosophy and morality
extant in Christendom.

242. For my own part, I have no purpose, in what remains
to me of opportunity, either at Oxford or elsewhere, to
address any farther course of instruction towards the development
of existing schools. After seeing the stream of the
Teviot as black as ink, and a putrid carcass of a sheep lying
in the dry channel of the Jed, under Jedburgh Abbey, (the
entire strength of the summer stream being taken away to
supply a single mill,) I know, finally, what value the British
mind sets on the 'beauties of nature,' and shall attempt no
farther the excitement of its enthusiasm in that direction.
I shall indeed endeavor to carry out, with Mr. Ward's help,
my twenty years' held purpose of making the real character
of Turner's work known, to the persons who, formerly interested
by the engravings from him, imagined half the merit
was of the engraver's giving. But I know perfectly that
to the general people, trained in the midst of the ugliest
objects that vice can design, in houses, mills, and machinery,
all beautiful form and color is as invisible as the seventh
heaven. It is not a question of appreciation at all; the thing
is physically invisible to them, as human speech is inaudible
during a steam whistle.

243. And I shall also use all the strength I have to convince
those, among our artists of the second order, who are
wise and modest enough not to think themselves the matches
of Turner or Michael Angelo, that in the present state of
art they only waste their powers in endeavoring to produce
original pictures of human form or passion. Modern aristocratic
life is too vulgar, and modern peasant life too
unhappy, to furnish subjects of noble study; while, even
were it otherwise, the multiplication of designs by painters[Pg 155]
of second-rate power is no more desirable than the writing
of music by inferior composers. They may, with far greater
personal happiness, and incalculably greater advantage to
others, devote themselves to the affectionate and sensitive
copying of the works of men of just renown. The dignity
of this self-sacrifice would soon be acknowledged with sincere
respect; for copies produced by men working with such motive
would differ no less from the common trade-article of the
galleries than the rendering of music by an enthusiastic and
highly trained executant differs from the grinding of a street
organ. And the change in the tone of public feeling, produced
by familiarity with such work, would soon be no less
great than in their musical enjoyment, if having been accustomed
only to hear black Christys, blind fiddlers, and hoarse
beggars scrape or howl about their streets, they were permitted
daily audience of faithful and gentle orchestral rendering of
the work of the highest classical masters.

244. I have not, until very lately, rightly appreciated the
results of the labor of the Arundel Society in this direction.
Although, from the beginning, I have been honored in being
a member of its council, my action has been hitherto rather
of check than help, because I thought more of the differences
between our copies and the great originals, than of their
unquestionable superiority to anything the public could
otherwise obtain.

I was practically convinced of their extreme value only
this last winter, by staying at the house of a friend in which
the Arundel engravings were the principal decoration; and
where I learned more of Masaccio from the Arundel copy
of the contest with Simon Magus, than in the Brancacci
chapel itself; for the daily companionship with the engraving
taught me subtleties in its composition which had escaped
me in the multitudinous interest of visits to the actual fresco.

But the work of the Society has been sorely hindered
hitherto, because it has had at command only the skill of
copyists trained in foreign schools of color, and accustomed
to meet no more accurate requisitions than those of the[Pg 156]
fashionable traveler. I have always hoped for, and trust at
last to obtain, co-operation with our too mildly laborious
copyists, of English artists possessing more brilliant color
faculty; and the permission of our subscribers to secure for
them the great ruins of the noble past, undesecrated by the
trim, but treacherous, plastering of modern emendation.

245. Finally, I hope to direct some of the antiquarian
energy often to be found remaining, even when love of the
picturesque has passed away, to encourage the accurate delineation
and engraving of historical monuments, as a direct
function of our schools of art. All that I have generally to
suggest on this matter has been already stated with sufficient
clearness in the first of my inaugural lectures at Oxford:
and my forthcoming 'Elements of Drawing'[BN] will contain
all the directions I can give in writing as to methods of work
for such purpose. The publication of these has been hindered,
for at least a year, by the abuses introduced by the modern
cheap modes of printing engravings. I find the men won't
use any ink but what pleases them; nor print but with what
pressure pleases them; and if I can get the foreman to attend
to the business, and choose the ink right, the men change it
the moment he leaves the room, and threaten to throw up the
job when they are detected. All this, I have long known
well, is a matter of course, in the outcome of modern principles
of trade; but it has rendered it hitherto impossible
for me to produce illustrations, which have been ready, as far
as my work or that of my own assistants is concerned, for a
year and a half. Any one interested in hearing of our
progress&mdash;or arrest, may write to my Turner copyist, Mr.
Ward:[BO] and, in the meantime, they can help my designs[Pg 157]
for art education best by making these Turner copies more
generally known; and by determining, when they travel, to
spend what sums they have at their disposal, not in fady
photography, but in the encouragement of any good water-color
and pencil draughtsmen whom they find employed in
the galleries of Europe.

ARTICLE II.

DETACHED NOTES.

I.

On the series of Sibyl engravings attributed to Botticelli.

246. Since I wrote the earlier lectures in this volume,
I have been made more doubtful on several points which were
embarrassing enough before, by seeing some better (so-called)
impressions of my favorite plates containing light and shade
which did not improve them.

I do not choose to waste time or space in discussion, till
I know more of the matter; and that more I must leave to
my good friend Mr. Reid of the British Museum to find out
for me; for I have no time to take up the subject myself, but
I give, for frontispiece to this Appendix, the engraving of
Joshua referred to in the text, which however beautiful in
thought, is an example of the inferior execution and more
elaborate shade which puzzle me. But whatever is said in
the previous pages of the plates chosen for example, by whomsoever
done, is absolutely trustworthy. Thoroughly fine they
are, in their existing state, and exemplary to all persons and
times. And of the rest, in fitting place I hope to give complete&mdash;or
at least satisfactory account.

II.

On the three excellent engravers representative of the first, middle,
and late schools.





XII.
The Coronation in the Garden.


247. I have given opposite a photograph, slightly reduced
from the D&uuml;rer Madonna, alluded to often in the text, as
an example of his best conception of womanhood. It is very[Pg 159]
curious that D&uuml;rer, the least able of all great artists to represent
womanhood, should of late have been a very principal
object of feminine admiration. The last thing a woman
should do is to write about art. They never see anything in
pictures but what they are told, (or resolve to see out of
contradiction,)&mdash;or the particular things that fall in with
their own feelings. I saw a curious piece of enthusiastic
writing by an Edinburgh lady, the other day, on the photographs
I had taken from the tower of Giotto. She did not
care a straw what Giotto had meant by them, declared she
felt it her duty only to announce what they were to her; and
wrote two pages on the bas-relief of Heracles and Ant&aelig;us&mdash;assuming
it to be the death of Abel.

248. It is not, however, by women only that D&uuml;rer has
been over-praised. He stands so alone in his own field, that
the people who care much for him generally lose the power
of enjoying anything else rightly; and are continually attributing
to the force of his imagination quaintnesses which are
merely part of the general mannerism of his day.

The following notes upon him, in relation to two other
excellent engravers, were written shortly for extempore expansion
in lecturing. I give them, with the others in this
terminal article, mainly for use to myself in future reference;
but also as more or less suggestive to the reader, if he has
taken up the subject seriously, and worth, therefore, a few
pages of this closing sheet.

249. The men I have named as representative of all the
good ones composing their school, are alike resolved their
engraving shall be lovely.

But Botticelli, the ancient, wants, with as little engraving,
as much Sibyl as possible.

D&uuml;rer, the central, wants, with as much engraving as
possible, anything of Sibyl that may chance to be picked up
with it.

Beaugrand, the modern, wants, as much Sibyl as possible,
and as much engraving too.

250. I repeat&mdash;for I want to get this clear to you[Pg 160]&mdash;Botticelli
wants, with as little engraving, as much Sibyl as
possible. For his head is full of Sibyls, and his heart. He
can't draw them fast enough: one comes, and another and
another; and all, gracious and wonderful and good, to be
engraved forever, if only he had a thousand hands and lives.
He scratches down one, with no haste, with no fault, divinely
careful, scrupulous, patient, but with as few lines as possible.
'Another Sibyl&mdash;let me draw another, for heaven's sake,
before she has burnt all her books, and vanished.'

D&uuml;rer is exactly Botticelli's opposite. He is a workman,
to the heart, and will do his work magnificently. 'No
matter what I do it on, so that my craft be honorably shown.
Anything will do; a Sibyl, a skull, a Madonna and Christ,
a hat and feather, an Adam, an Eve, a cock, a sparrow, a
lion with two tails, a pig with five legs,&mdash;anything will do
for me. But see if I don't show you what engraving is, be
my subject what it may!'

251. Thirdly: Beaugrand, I said, wants as much Sibyl as
possible, and as much engraving. He is essentially a copyist,
and has no ideas of his own, but deep reverence and love for
the work of others. He will give his life to represent another
man's thought. He will do his best with every spot and line,&mdash;exhibit
to you, if you will only look, the most exquisite
completion of obedient skill; but will be content, if you will
not look, to pass his neglected years in fruitful peace, and
count every day well spent that has given softness to a shadow,
or light to a smile.

III.

On D&uuml;rer's landscape, with reference to the sentence on p. 101: "I hope
you are pleased."

252. I spoke just now only of the ill-shaped body of this
figure of Fortune, or Pleasure. Beneath her feet is an elaborate
landscape. It is all drawn out of D&uuml;rer's head;&mdash;he
would look at bones or tendons carefully, or at the leaf details[Pg 161]
of foreground;&mdash;but at the breadth and loveliness of real
landscape, never.

He has tried to give you a bird's-eye view of Germany;
rocks, and woods, and clouds, and brooks, and the pebbles in
their beds, and mills, and cottages, and fences, and what not;
but it is all a feverish dream, ghastly and strange, a monotone
of diseased imagination.

And here is a little bit of the world he would not look at&mdash;of
the great river of his land, with a single cluster of its
reeds, and two boats, and an island with a village, and the
way for the eternal waters opened between the rounded hills.[BP]

It is just what you may see any day, anywhere,&mdash;innocent,
seemingly artless; but the artlessness of Turner is like
the face of Gainsborough's village girl, and a joy forever.

IV.

On the study of anatomy.

253. The virtual beginner of artistic anatomy in Italy was
a man called 'The Poulterer'&mdash;from his grandfather's trade;
'Pollajuolo,' a man of immense power, but on whom the
curse of the Italian mind in this age[BQ] was set at its deepest.

Any form of passionate excess has terrific effects on body
and soul, in nations as in men; and when this excess is in
rage, and rage against your brother, and rage accomplished
in habitual deeds of blood,&mdash;do you think Nature will forget
to set the seal of her indignation upon the forehead? I told
you that the great division of spirit between the northern
and southern races had been reconciled in the Val d'Arno.
The Font of Florence, and the Font of Pisa, were as the very[Pg 162]
springs of the life of the Christianity which had gone forth
to teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Prince
of Peace. Yet these two brother cities were to each other&mdash;I
do not say as Abel and Cain, but as Eteocles and Polynices,
and the words of &AElig;schylus are now fulfilled in them to the
uttermost. The Arno baptizes their dead bodies:&mdash;their
native valley between its mountains is to them as the furrow
of a grave;&mdash;"and so much of their land they have, as is
sepulcher." Nay, not of Florence and Pisa only was this
true: Venice and Genoa died in death-grapple; and eight
cities of Lombardy divided between them the joy of leveling
Milan to her lowest stone. Nay, not merely in city against
city, but in street against street, and house against house, the
fury of the Theban dragon flamed ceaselessly, and with the
same excuse upon men's lips. The sign of the shield of Polynices,
Justice bringing back the exile, was to them all, in
turn, the portent of death: and their history, in the sum of
it and substance, is as of the servants of Joab and Abner by
the pool of Gibeon. "They caught every one his fellow
by the head, and thrust his sword in his fellow's side; so they
fell down together: wherefore that place was called 'the
field of the strong men.'"

254. Now it is not possible for Christian men to live thus,
except under a fever of insanity. I have before, in my lectures
on Prudence and Insolence in art, deliberately asserted
to you the logical accuracy of the term 'demoniacal possession'[BR]&mdash;the
being in the power or possession of a betraying
spirit; and the definite sign of such insanity is delight
in witnessing pain, usually accompanied by an instinct
that gloats over or plays with physical uncleanness or disease,
and always by a morbid egotism. It is not to be recognized
for demoniacal power so much by its viciousness, as
its paltriness,&mdash;the taking pleasure in minute, contemptible,
and loathsome things.[BS] Now, in the middle of the[Pg 163]
gallery of the Brera at Milan, there is an elaborate study
of a dead Christ, entirely characteristic of early fifteenth
century Italian madman's work. It is called&mdash;and was presented
to the people as&mdash;a Christ; but it is only an anatomical
study of a vulgar and ghastly dead body, with the soles of
the feet set straight at the spectator, and the rest foreshortened.
It is either Castagno's or Mantegna's,&mdash;in my mind,
set down to Castagno; but I have not looked at the picture
for years, and am not sure at this moment. It does not
matter a straw which: it is exactly characteristic of the madness
in which all of them&mdash;Pollajuolo, Castagno, Mantegna,
Lionardo da Vinci, and Michael Angelo, polluted their work
with the science of the sepulcher,[BT] and degraded it with[Pg 164]
presumptuous and paltry technical skill. Foreshorten your
Christ, and paint Him, if you can, half putrefied,&mdash;that is
the scientific art of the Renaissance.

255. It is impossible, however, in so vast a subject to distinguish
always the beginner of things from the establisher.[Pg 165]
To the poulterer's son, Pollajuolo, remains the eternal shame
of first making insane contest the only subject of art; but
the two establishers of anatomy were Lionardo and Michael
Angelo. You hear of Lionardo chiefly because of his Last
Supper, but Italy did not hear of him for that. This was not
what brought her to worship Lionardo&mdash;but the Battle of
the Standard.

V.

Fragments on Holbein and others.

256. Of Holbein's St. Elizabeth, remember, she is not a
perfect Saint Elizabeth, by any means. She is an honest
and sweet German lady,&mdash;the best he could see; he could do
no better;&mdash;and so I come back to my old story,&mdash;no man can[Pg 166]
do better than he sees: if he can reach the nature round him,
it is well; he may fall short of it; he cannot rise above it;
"the best, in this kind, are but shadows."



Yet that intense veracity of Holbein is indeed the strength
and glory of all the northern schools. They exist only in
being true. Their work among men is the definition of what
is, and the abiding by it. They cannot dream of what is
not. They make fools of themselves if they try. Think how
feeble even Shakspere is when he tries his hand at a Goddess;&mdash;women,
beautiful and womanly, as many as you choose;
but who cares what his Minerva or Juno says, in the masque
of the Tempest? And for the painters&mdash;when Sir Joshua
tries for a Madonna, or Vandyke for a Diana&mdash;they can't
even paint! they become total simpletons. Look at Rubens'
mythologies in the Louvre, or at modern French heroics, or
German pietisms! Why, all&mdash;Cornelius, Hesse, Overbeck,
and David&mdash;put together, are not worth one De Hooghe of
an old woman with a broom sweeping a back-kitchen. The
one thing we northerns can do is to find out what is fact,
and insist on it: mean fact it may be, or noble&mdash;but fact
always, or we die.

257. Yet the intensest form of northern realization can be
matched in the south, when the southerns choose. There are
two pieces of animal drawing in the Sistine Chapel unrivaled
for literal veracity. The sheep at the well in front of
Zipporah; and afterwards, when she is going away, leading
her children, her eldest boy, like every one else, has taken his
chief treasure with him, and this treasure is his pet dog. It
is a little sharp-nosed white fox-terrier, full of fire and life;
but not strong enough for a long walk. So little Gershom,
whose name was "the stranger" because his father had been
a stranger in a strange land,&mdash;little Gershom carries his
white terrier under his arm, lying on the top of a large
bundle to make it comfortable. The doggie puts its sharp
nose and bright eyes out, above his hand, with a little roguish[Pg 167]
gleam sideways in them, which means,&mdash;if I can read rightly
a dog's expression,&mdash;that he has been barking at Moses all
the morning and has nearly put him out of temper:&mdash;and
without any doubt, I can assert to you that there is not any
other such piece of animal painting in the world,&mdash;so brief,
intense, vivid, and absolutely balanced in truth: as tenderly
drawn as if it had been a saint, yet as humorously as Landseer's
Lord Chancellor poodle.

258. Oppose to&mdash;



Holbein's Veracity&mdash;
Botticelli's Fantasy.


"&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shade
"&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Color.


"&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Despair
"&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Faith.


"&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Grossness
"&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Purity.




True Fantasy. Botticelli's Tree in Hellespontic Sibyl.
Not a real tree at all&mdash;yet founded on intensest perception
of beautiful reality. So the swan of Clio, as opposed to
D&uuml;rer's cock, or to Turner's swan.

The Italian power of abstraction into one mythologic
personage&mdash;Holbein's death is only literal. He has to split
his death into thirty different deaths; and each is but a
skeleton. But Orcagna's death is one&mdash;the power of death
itself. There may thus be as much breadth in thought, as in
execution.



259. What then, we have to ask, is a man conscious of in
what he sees?

For instance, in all Cruikshank's etchings&mdash;however slight
the outline&mdash;there is an intense consciousness of light and
shade, and of local color, as a part of light and shade; but
none of color itself. He was wholly incapable of coloring;
and perhaps this very deficiency enabled him to give graphic
harmony to engraving.



Bewick&mdash;snow-pieces, etc. Gray predominant; perfect
sense of color, coming out in patterns of birds;&mdash;yet so uncul[Pg 168]tivated,
that he engraves the brown birds better than pheasant
or peacock!

For quite perfect consciousness of color makes engraving
impossible, and you have instead&mdash;Correggio.

VI.

Final notes on light and shade.

260. You will find in the 138th and 147th paragraphs of
my Inaugural lectures, statements which, if you were reading
the book by yourselves, would strike you probably as each of
them difficult, and in some degree inconsistent,&mdash;namely,
that the school of color has exquisite character and sentiment;
but is childish, cheerful, and fantastic; while the school of
shade is deficient in character and sentiment; but supreme in
intellect and veracity. "The way by light and shade," I
say, "is taken by men of the highest powers of thought and
most earnest desire for truth."

The school of shade, I say, is deficient in character and
sentiment. Compare any of D&uuml;rer's Madonnas with any of
Angelico's.

Yet you may discern in the Apocalypse engravings that
D&uuml;rer's mind was seeking for truths, and dealing with questions,
which no more could have occurred to Angelico's mind
than to that of a two-years-old baby.

261. The two schools unite in various degrees; but are
always distinguishably generic, the two headmost masters
representing each being Tintoret and Perugino. The one,
deficient in sentiment, and continually offending us by the
want of it, but full of intellectual power and suggestion.

The other, repeating ideas with so little reflection that he
gets blamed for doing the same thing over again, (Vasari);
but exquisite in sentiment and the conditions of taste which
it forms, so as to become the master of it to Raphael and to
all succeeding him; and remaining such a type of sentiment,
too delicate to be felt by the latter practical mind of Dutch-[Pg 169]bred
England, that Goldsmith makes the admiration of him
the test of absurd connoisseurship. But yet, with under-current
of intellect, which gets him accused of free-thinking,
and therefore with under-current of entirely exquisite
chiaroscuro.

Light and shade, then, imply the understanding of things&mdash;Color,
the imagination and the sentiment of them.

262. In Turner's distinctive work, color is scarcely acknowledged
unless under influence of sunshine. The sunshine
is his treasure; his lividest gloom contains it; his
grayest twilight regrets it, and remembers. Blue is always
a blue shadow; brown or gold, always light;&mdash;nothing is
cheerful but sunshine; wherever the sun is not, there is
melancholy or evil. Apollo is God; and all forms of death
and sorrow exist in opposition to him.

But in Perugino's distinctive work,&mdash;and therefore I
have given him the captain's place over all,&mdash;there is simply
no darkness, no wrong. Every color is lovely, and every
space is light. The world, the universe, is divine: all sadness
is a part of harmony; and all gloom, a part of peace.

THE END.

his work should get the least mechanical. The admirable drawings
of Venice, by my good assistant, Mr. Bunney, resident there, will
become of more value to their purchasers every year, as the buildings

note by Mr. Tyrwhitt contains, I think, the probable truth:&mdash;

"The facts relating to Sandro Botticelli's models, or rather to his
favorite model (as it appears to me), are but few; and it is greatly to
be regretted that his pictures are seldom dated;&mdash;if it were certain in
what order they appeared, what follows here might approach moral
certainty.

"There is no doubt that he had great personal regard for Fra Filippo,
up to that painter's death in 1469, Sandro being then twenty-two years
old. He may probably have got only good from him; anyhow he
would get a strong turn for Realism,&mdash;i.e. the treatment of sacred and
all other subjects in a realistic manner. He is described in Crowe and
Cavalcaselle from Filippino Lippi's Martyrdom of St. Peter, as a sullen
and sensual man, with beetle brows, large fleshy mouth, etc., etc.
Probably he was a strong man, and intense in physical and intellectual
habit.

"This man, then, begins to paint in his strength, with conviction&mdash;rather
happy and innocent than not&mdash;that it is right to paint any beautiful
thing, and best to paint the most beautiful,&mdash;say in 1470, at twenty-three
years of age. The allegorical Spring and the Graces, and the
Aphrodite now in the Ufficii, were painted for Cosmo, and seem to be
taken by Vasari and others as early, or early-central, works in his life:
also the portrait of Simonetta Vespucei[1]. He is known to have painted
much in early life for the Vespucei and the Medici;&mdash;and this daughter
of the former house seems to have been inamorata or mistress of Giuliano
de' Medici, murdered by the Pazzi in 1478. Now it seems agreed
by Crowe and Cavalcaselle, Pater, etc., (and I am quite sure of it myself
as to the pictures mentioned)&mdash;first, that the same slender and
long-throated model appears in Spring, the Aphrodite, Calumny, and
other works.[2] Secondly, that she was Simonetta, the original of the
Pitti portrait.

"Now I think she must have been induced to let Sandro draw from
her whole person undraped, more or less; and that he must have done
so as such a man probably would, in strict honor as to deed, word, and
definite thought, but under occasional accesses of passion of which he
said nothing, and which in all probability and by grace of God refined
down to nil, or nearly so, as he got accustomed to look in honor at so
beautiful a thing. (He may have left off the undraped after her death.)
First, her figure is absolutely fine Gothic; I don't think any antique is so
slender. Secondly, she has the sad, passionate, and exquisite Lombard
mouth. Thirdly, her limbs shrink together, and she seems not quite
to have 'liked it' or been an accustomed model. Fourthly, there is
tradition, giving her name to all those forms.

"Her lover Giuliano was murdered in 1478, and Savonarola hanged
and burnt in 1498. Now, can her distress, and Savonarola's preaching,
between them, have taken, in few years, all the carnality out of Sandro,
supposing him to have come already, by seventy-eight, to that
state in which the sight of her delighted him, without provoking
ulterior feelings? All decent men accustomed to draw from the nude
tell us they get to that.

"Sandro's Dante is dated as published in 1482. He may have been
saddening by that time, and weary of beauty, pure or mixed;&mdash;though
he went on painting Madonnas, I fancy. (Can Simonetta be traced in
any of them? I think not. The Sistine paintings extend from 1481
to 1484, however. I cannot help thinking Zipporah is impressed with
her.) After Savonarola's death, Sandro must have lost heart, and gone
into Dante altogether. Most ways in literature and art lead to Dante;
and this question about the nude and the purity of Botticelli is no
exception to the rule.

"Now in the Purgatorio, Lust is the last sin of which we are to be
made pure, and it has to be burnt out of us; being itself as searching
as fire, as smoldering, devouring, and all that. Corruptio: optimi
pessima; and it is the most searching and lasting of evils, because it
really is a corruption attendant on true Love, which is eternal&mdash;whatever
the word means. That this is so, seems to me to demonstrate
the truth of the Fall of Man from the condition of moral very-goodness
in God's sight. And I think that Dante connected the purifying
pains of his intermediate state with actual sufferings in this life, working
out repentance,&mdash;in himself and others. And the 'torment' of
this passion, to the repentant or resisting, or purity-seeking soul is
decidedly like the pain of physical burning.

"Further, its casuistry is impracticable; because the more you stir
the said 'fire' the stronger hold it takes. Therefore, men and women
are rightly secret about it, and detailed confessions unadvisable. Much
talk about 'hypocrisy' in this matter is quite wrong and unjust. Then,
its connection with female beauty, as a cause of love between man and
woman, seems to me to be the inextricable nodus of the Fall, the here
inseparable mixture of good and evil, till soul and body are parted.
For the sense of seen Beauty is the awakening of Love, at whatever
distance from any kind of return or sympathy&mdash;as with a rose, or what
not. Sandro may be the man who has gone nearest to the right separation
of Delight from Desire: supposing that he began with religion
and a straight conscience; saw lovingly the error of Fra Filippo's way;
saw with intense distant love the error of Simonetta's; and reflected
on Florence and its way, and drew nearer and nearer to Savonarola,
being yet too big a man for asceticism; and finally wearied of all things
and sunk into poverty and peace."

[2] I think Zipporah may be a remembrance of her.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
