<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p class="poem">No warrior he, a village lad,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">needing nor words nor other prod</span><br />
To point his duty; he was glad<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">to tread the path his fathers trod.</span><br />
Week days he worked in wood and field;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">with homely joys he decked his life;</span><br />
The sword of hate he would not wield,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">nor take a part in cankering strife.</span><br />
On Sunday in the little choir<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">he sang of Peace and brotherly love,</span><br />
And as his thoughts soared higher and higher,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">they reached unmeasured heights above.</span><br />
<br />
A cry for Freedom rent the Land&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Our Country calls, come, come, 'tis War;</span><br />
Together let us firmly stand;"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">he answered, though his heart beat sore</span><br />
At leaving home, and kin, and one<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">in whose fond eyes too late he read</span><br />
That life for her had but begun<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">with the farewells he sadly said.</span><br />
<br />
A half a century has passed&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">and more&mdash;since all those myriads fell;</span><br />
For he was one of those who cast<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">sweet life into a Battle's hell.</span><br />
The village has become a town,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">brick buildings the old graveyard gird;</span><br />
Of him who fought not for renown,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">no one now hears a spoken word,</span><br />
But on the Monument his name<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">in gold is lettered with the rest.</span><br />
Without a sordid thought of fame<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">he to his Country gave his best.</span><br />
<br />
Strew flowers, then, Memorial Day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">for him, for all who for us fought.</span><br />
With speech and music honors pay;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">teach what our brave defenders taught.</span><br />
And now our sons are setting out;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">the call for Right rings to the sky,</span><br />
"Our Country! Freedom!" hear them shout,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">re-echoing their Grandsires' cry.</span><br />

Flowers for brave soldiers,<br />
Flowers for those who gave us<br />
A Country undivided.<br />
Flowers for the dead!<br />
<br />
With flags we are marking<br />
Their last earth-dwelling.<br />
Our hearts are bending<br />
In gratitude,<br />
While we are praying<br />
That this our Nation<br />
Pass safe through peril,<br />
Through deadly war.<br />
<br />
Flowers for brave soldiers&mdash;<br />
Flowers for those who loved us,<br />
Flowers to their memory,<br />

<p class="poem">
From top to pedestal you scan it lightly&mdash;<br />
Capped head to lettered base&mdash;and you are smiling.<br />
What see you there to set your lips a-quiver?<br />
An awkward figure cut from ugly granite,<br />
Aye, roughly hewn, as if unhelped by chisel,<br />
This peaceful man of war, sculptured grotesquely.<br />
Still&mdash;there is metal in the gun he is holding,<br />
And in the cannon balls piled up before him&mdash;<br />
The artist's symbols of a real soldier.<br />
Yet jeer no longer!<br />
Before you is a soldier of the Union,<br />
Crowned with the tears and prayers of many mourners.<br />
The Village set him here for all to honor,<br />
Here, in the centre of their foot-worn common,<br />
Where on long, summer evenings boys at baseball<br />
May gaze and gaze, and make him an example;<br />
A hero they would follow.<br />
Beholding him I see no granite figure,<br />
But face a man who fought to save his country,<br />
Whose heart was pierced when wife, and child and mother<br />
Clung to him closely in that tearful parting.<br />
Yet brave he marched away while flags were fluttering,<br />
Though in his soul he knew that never, never,<br />
Might he again see those he loved so dearly,<br />
Nor look again upon the old white steeple,<br />
Upon the little streets and shabby buildings<br />
Straggling unevenly toward the Common;<br />
Or if he came back, he'd be maimed and battered,<br />
Subject to hateful pity.<br />
Therefore I smile not at the queer, gaunt figure,<br />
The tilted cap&mdash;the wide and baggy trousers,<br />
The long loose overcoat, the dangling knapsack,<br />
This is the man who fought to save our country!<br />
Who, in his millions, marched from every village,<br />
From every city of our mighty Nation;<br />
Who heard the drums and trumpets blithely playing&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span><br />
"Tramp, tramp, tramp, the boys are marching."<br />
So there it stands&mdash;thank-offering of a people&mdash;<br />
Whether of rough-hewn stone, or bronze, or marble&mdash;<br />
Proving our debt to those who saved the Union,<br />
Pointing the way for those who'd like to follow&mdash;<br />
Who to the death would fight were we in peril&mdash;<br />
The Soldier's Monument!<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="poem">
Behold a long procession passing proudly,<br />
And yet no glittering pomp adorns its way,<br />
Only the emblems of our States and Nation,<br />
Only the flags that floated on the day<br />
These men, our men, trod upon fields of glory;&mdash;<br />
The tattered flags that this Grand Army bore<br />
For the Republic&mdash;flags that furled and faded<br />
To their old vividness our hearts restore.<br />
The line of veterans once firm and crowded,<br />
The long, long line is wavering and thin;<br />
With faltering steps Old Age speaks mutely to them<br />
Youth marched abreast when they were mustered in.<br />
<br />
Oh, Comrades of the Campfire and the Council,<br />
Oh, Comrades who in peril won your fight!<br />
Honor to you and to your dead companions,<br />
You risked your all for Liberty and Right!<br />
Fraternity and Charity your watchwords,<br />
And Loyalty to this our own dear Land!<br />
Our flag you have, the brazen star, the eagle<br />
Undying symbols for your gallant band.<br />
Look at them, youths and maidens, as they pass you,<br />
While old-time war-tunes break upon the air,<br />
And staring crowds applaud; read ye the message<br />
That from the past these veterans nobly bear,<br />
"Our gift&mdash;the gift of Freedom to the Nation,<br />
Our great Republic would entrust to you,<br />
Cherish it fondly, keeping it untarnished,<br />
That, in the Future, looming on our view,<br />
You with the World may share your gift of Freedom."<br />
<br />
This is the message that our youth must con,<br />
While the Grand Army, answering its last roll-call<br />
And laying down life's weapons, passes on.<br />

We saw the Regiment, alert and strong,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In marching line, on Soldiers' Field today,</span><br />
Ah! ready they to battle with the wrong;&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">This flower of youth&mdash;eager and brave and gay.</span><br />
<br />
And we, on-looking, cheered them as they passed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And we, down-heartened, prayed a silent prayer,</span><br />
Gazing upon them with a grim forecast,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And many a sad-eyed mother watched them there.</span><br />

<p class="poem">
Oh, the noise of Piccadilly&mdash;its rumble and its roar!<br />
A tide of life's broad ocean surging toward the shore.<br />
Who once has listened, ever can hear its long refrain<br />
With haunting echo drowning or dirge or flaunting strain.<br />
Who heeds it, in his vision may see a world-throng pass&mdash;<br />
And over there the Green Park with laughing lad and lass;<br />
While weary men and women and careless youth go by,<br />
Where windows glow and glitter, and in the evening sky<br />
A crescent moon is watching the laughing lass and lad.<br />
The long, warm London twilight! Happy they are, though sad.<br />
With kiss and tear they are parting. 'Tis late&mdash;the rush and roar&mdash;<br />
The life of Picadilly is waning&mdash;is no more.<br />
<br />
Ah, the dark, the cold, the stillness of the trenches in the night,<br />
Where freezing men are crouching in the lull before the fight.<br />
Then for one the calm is broken by the rumble and the roar<br />
Of far-off Picadilly, and in dreams, as oft before,<br />
He sees her who wept at parting. What was that? A whining shell?<br />
Once a man&mdash;that huddled horror! He was smiling as he fell.<br />
<br />
Summer has returned to London. Now the Green Park gleams anew.<br />
Cheers and tears together mingle&mdash;but the breaking heart beats true.<br />
Blare of trumpet!&mdash;blood and fire!&mdash;so her hero marched away.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span><br />
Happy lad and lass they parted&mdash;now the pitying sky is gray.<br />
Blood and fire! Through its heroes shall a nation live again.<br />
Blare of trumpet! But in silence aching hearts must bear their pain.<br />
Ah, the stillness of the trenches! ah, the rumble and the roar!<br />
Cheers and tears by England offered for the lads who come no more.<br />

Rest here, my horse, the night is dull,&mdash;the blood-sick stars are gone,<br />
Listen, for thou like me wert bred in far Saskatchewan.<br />
And this September night at home, under a happier sky,<br />
The bursting yellow sheaves upon the unbounded prairie lie.<br />
Bread, bread&mdash;the staff and stay of life&mdash;'tis what the wheatlands yield;<br />
But only death and agony are gathered from this field.<br />
<br />
There's respite now, but ah! good friend, before another day,<br />
Although our bodies may be here, we, we, how far away!<br />
We've ridden many a weary mile, together we have fought<br />
For Freedom, honor and the right, and anything we've wrought<br />
Our Country to the Empire will still more closely bind.<br />
Ah! where the reddened maple leaf is fluttering in the wind,<br />
There is my heart, oh noble horse, and may we gallop free<br />
Some day again in Canada, our Land of Liberty.<br />
<br />
The night drags on toward the dawn, and far on yonder plain<br />
I hear the throb of musketry, I feel its echoing pain.<br />
I see the star-shells breaking, and nearer than their flare,<br />
A wreath of deadly smoke points out that once a town was there.<br />
Look, brother horse, the night is past, and glorious is the dawn,<br />
Away with peril! We'll ride on for our Saskatchewan.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span><br />
With day comes hope, and though again the sky with blood is red,<br />
We'll ride against the enemy, for Victory lies ahead,<br />
Aye! for the Empire&mdash;Victory that thou shalt help to bring.<br />
And for the Allies Victory&mdash;on earth what greater thing!<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Pure, fearless, on an holy errand bent,</span><br />

Everything proclaims that daily now draws nearer spring the fair.<br />

<p class="poem">
Who then is rich, who poor? I'll tell you now<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of one, a meagre life who had to live,</span><br />
Wear dingy garb, and scarcely could allow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Himself what men call comfort; yet to give</span><br />
Was his delight,&mdash;to give full-heartedly.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Though Fate had hampered him, he always knew</span><br />
Some one still poorer. In humility<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He thus gave hope to him who had small view</span><br />
Of happier things;&mdash;solace to him who wept;&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And to the beaten courage to endure.</span><br />
He shared his little with the starved, and kept<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His best for those who needed most. Though poor,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">By giving he grew richer day by day</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">In all that brightens life's uncertain way.</span><br />
<br />
There was another who had never known<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A wish unsatisfied. For everything</span><br />
That luxury could offer was his own.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thus all that learning, all that wealth could bring</span><br />
Adorned his life. The many him would praise,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For this world loves the prosperous,&mdash;and still</span><br />
Close to himself he hugged his all. To raise<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A helping hand he never had the will.</span><br />
He never heard the cries of men in need.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of all he had he would not give a part.</span><br />
For "I" and "mine" was ever his one creed.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No balm had he for any aching heart.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Mean was his life (as was the other's great)</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Despite the splendor of his high estate.</span><br />
And now in yonder world I wonder which&mdash;<br />
For both are dead&mdash;is counted poor&mdash;or rich.<br />

<p class="poem">
Today I had the awfulest time,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Dear mother, in the wood.</span><br />
That hill out there we were to climb,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And we'd been very good.</span><br />
But nurse was walking up the hill,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When little Anne and I,</span><br />
We had to stop and stand quite still,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And Anne began to cry.</span><br />
<br />
For something moved behind the trees,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We felt so all alone&mdash;</span><br />
Said I to Anne, "Stop crying, please,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I'll hit it with a stone."</span><br />
Cried Anne, "Oh, listen, hear it growl."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Said I, "I'm not afraid</span><br />
Of bears or lions." "Now don't scowl.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You look so cross," she said.</span><br />
So then I had to smile and smile, for Anne was crying all the while.<br />
And if we didn't <i>hear</i> a bear, I'm sure, dear mother, one was there.<br />
<br />
Boys always must take care of girls,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You see you've told me so.</span><br />
That's why I tried to pat Anne's curls,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And walked with her real slow.</span><br />
But when we heard nurse calling out,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Come, children, come along!"</span><br />
"Come, Nurse," you should have heard me shout&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Anne says my voice is strong.</span><br />
"Run, Anne," I cried, "I'm almost five, and I'll kill any bear alive."<br />
And if we didn't <i>see</i> a bear, I truly think that one was there.<br />
<br />
How glad I was when Nurse turn'd round,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For everything seemed queer.</span><br />
The trees looked strange, and then that sound<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We didn't like to hear.</span><br />
Nurse laughed when we had told her all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">About the bear we saw.</span><br />
"I came as quick's I heard you call,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And it's against the law</span><br />
For bears to live where people stay. They are five hundred miles away."<br />
But if we didn't <i>meet</i> a bear, I'm sure that <i>almost</i> one was there.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="poem">
I'm always glad when Christmas comes, and yet I'd like it better;<br />
If mother wouldn't bother me to write a Christmas letter<br />
To uncle John and Cousin Kate and dear old Grand-aunt Gray,<br />
And all whose presents come to me from places far away.<br />
Of course I love my presents, and if givers should forget her,<br />
No little girl, my mother says, need write a Christmas letter.<br />
For oh! my ink makes awful blots, though I try to do real well,<br />
And when you write them out of school, all words are hard to spell.<br />
I mean to mind my mother, she's so kind I would not fret her,<br />
But when she says, "Stop playing, dear. Come, write this Christmas letter,"<br />
That's just the thing I hate to hear, and if I dared, I wouldn't<br />
Remember how to hold a pen, I'd make believe I couldn't.<br />

<p class="poem">
My Auntie has a camera, and when I'm out at play<br />
And see her coming with it, I try to hide away.<br />
For oh, it is so bothersome to hear her, with a laugh,<br />
Call, "Stand just were you are, dear; I'll take a photograph."<br />
<br />
Sometimes, an angry lion, I have just begun to roar,<br />
And all the children run from me to sneak behind the door,<br />
When Auntie to our forest comes&mdash;why does she stop our fun?<br />
I'd like to shoot that camera there with my wooden gun.<br />
<br />
Perhaps, a fire engine, I am rushing to a fire,<br />
While people loudly call for help as flames rise higher and higher.<br />
I hurry toward the hydrant here, for oh! the flames are hot!<br />
When Auntie with her camera cries, "What a fine snapshot!"<br />
<br />
But then it doesn't seem to snap, so I must be polite,<br />
And when she says, "Oh please, stand still, the sun is not just right,"<br />
I have to pull up where I am, and see that house burn down,<br />
For Auntie doesn't understand, even when I twist and frown.<br />
<br />
She only says, "Don't squirm, my pet! Oh, what a cunning pose!<br />
Your scowl is better than a smile,"&mdash;so that's the way it goes&mdash;<br />
A p'liceman or an admiral, no matter what I am,<br />
I have to face that camera as quiet as a lamb.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="poem">
Oh! it is little Margery who has a garden-bed,<br />
Wherein grow purple pansies and geraniums white and red,<br />
With feverfew and dahlias, and delicate pink phlox,<br />
And grandmother's fair favorites, old-fashioned hollyhocks.<br />
<br />
One night we feared Jack Frost might come to blight the tender flowers&mdash;<br />
We almost felt his cruel breath in the early evening hours;<br />
So Margery took coverings and spread them, thick and warm,<br />
To shield the flowers, as blankets wrap a sleeping baby's form.<br />
<br />
Then in the morning, when we looked across the dewy grass,<br />
And saw the traces Jack Frost leaves where he is wont to pass&mdash;<br />
For each spreading tree and slender bush had felt his chill caress,<br />
And some had drooped, and some had blushed in crimson loveliness&mdash;<br />
<br />
We hastened to the garden-bed, and there, in bright array,<br />
The little flowers looked blithely up to greet the smiling day.<br />
Safe hid from Jack Frost's piercing breath, he never saw them there,<br />
And the flowers still bloom for Margery, to thank her for her care.<br />

I knew a little boy, not very long ago,<br />
Who was as bright and happy as any boy you know.<br />
He had an only fault, and you will all agree<br />
That from a fault like this a boy himself might free.<br />
<br />
"I wonder who is there, oh, see! now, why is this?"<br />
And "Oh, where are they going?" and "Tell me what it is?"<br />
Ah! "which" and "why" and "who," and "what" and "where" and "when,"<br />
We often wished that never need we hear those words again.<br />
<br />
He seldom stopped to think; he almost always knew<br />
The answer to the questions that around the world he threw.<br />
To children seeking knowledge a quick reply we give,<br />
But answering what he asked was pouring water through a sieve.<br />
Yet you'll admit his fate was as sad as it was strange.<br />
Our eyes we hardly trusted, who slowly saw him change.<br />
More curious grew his head, stemlike his limbs, and hark!<br />
He was at last a mere interrogation-mark!<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="poem">
I want to see a grandmother like those there used to be,<br />
In a cosy little farm-house, where I could go to tea;<br />
A grandmother with spectacles and a funny, frilly cap,<br />
Who would make me sugar cookies, and take me on her lap,<br />
And tell me lots of stories of the days when she was small,<br />
When everything was perfect&mdash;not like today at all.<br />
<br />
My grandmother is "grandma," and she lives in a hotel,<br />
And when they ask "What is his age?" she smiles and will not tell.<br />
Says she doesn't care to realize that she is growing old;<br />
Then whispers&mdash;"But you're far too big a boy for me to hold."<br />
Her dresses shine and rustle, and her hair is wavy brown,<br />
And she has an automobile, that she steers, herself, down town.<br />
<br />
My grandmother is pretty. "Do I love her?" Rather&mdash;yes;<br />
Our Norah calls her stylish, and on the whole I guess<br />
She's better than the other kind, for once, when I was ill,<br />
She helped my mother nurse me, and read to me until<br />
I fell asleep; and stayed with me, and wasn't tired, and then<br />
She played nine holes of golf with me when I got out again.<br />
Yet, because I've never seen one, just once I want to see<br />
A real old-fashioned grandmother, like those there used to be.<br />

<p class="poem">
When your father, long ago, tried to train you&mdash;and you know<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He thought mornings meant for school, and not for swimming&mdash;</span><br />
How your heart beat loud in dread as relentlessly he said,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"You'll <i>remember</i>&mdash;when you've had another trimming."</span><br />
<br />
When your daughter buys a hat, and you're wondering thereat,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As before the glass she stands, its beauty hymning;</span><br />
Ah! the mischief in her eyes, as she pleads, "Show no surprise<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At the <i>cost</i>. One has to pay for <i>pretty trimming</i>."</span><br />
<br />
When the butcher brings your bill, and you stare at it until<br />

Then you hear him meekly say, as your anger you display,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"It seems high, because there's so much <i>waste</i> in trimming."</span><br />

So when politicians try your votes to beg or buy<br />

<p class="poem">
"Stone walls do not a prison make, nor iron bars a cage"<br />
High halls do not a College make, nor book-lined shelves a sage.<br />
So might I follow haltingly these olden words to show<br />
That even in this newer home the Annex may not know<br />
A greater zeal for learning than the old house could bestow.<br />
But comparisons are odious, so I'll merely try to say<br />
That cherished deep within the hearts of many here today<br />
Is the memory of that early home in the classic Appian Way.<br />
There first did the young Annex (whose real Christian name<br />
Contains as many syllables as it has liens on fame)<br />
Win laurels even brighter than its friends had hoped to claim.<br />
And there, too, in their search, for intellectual recreation<br />
Its students formed the short-lived <i>Appian Way Association</i><br />
Of which this later Club is but an "Idler" imitation.<br />
Just where the interloper dwelt was long a mystery.<br />
In the past to Harvard students and to townsmen equally,<br />
Till they cried, "There is no Annex&mdash;believe we only what we see!"<br />
Now the Annex and its mission every year are better known,<br />
From the smallest of beginnings strong and powerful it has grown:<br />
Only Harvard Freshmen speak of it in supercilious tone,<br />
Although custom would forbid us as we are passing near,<br />
To salute the ancient building with a rousing Annex cheer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span><br />
We need no sign like this to prove that still we hold it dear.<br />
Now the students who have profited by their foreseeing care<br />
Fondly thank the Annex founders who knew not the word "despair."<br />
Its best home was the hearts of those who planned the structure fair.<br />

With favoring winds, and with twin Pollux guiding<br />

<p class="poem">
The hardy youth, my friends, in bitter warfare<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To narrow poverty must learn to bend,</span><br />
And, for his spear a horseman to be dreaded,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Courageous Parthians into flight must send.</span><br />
And he must try all dangerous adventures,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His life out in the open he must pass;</span><br />
The warring tyrant's wife and growing daughter<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Him spying from their hostile walls, "Alas,"</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Unskilled in warlike arts, should dare attack</span><br />
This lion, fierce to touch, whom bloody anger<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Into the midst of slaughter has dragged back.</span><br />
'Tis sweet and fit to perish for one's country,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Death follows fast upon the man who flees,</span><br />
Nor spares the coward backs of youth retreating,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor saves them trembling on their timid knees,</span><br />
Valor, of shabby failure all unconscious,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Gleams with untarnished honor where she stands,</span><br />
Assuming not, nor laying down her emblems,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As now the gaping populace demands.</span><br />
Valor, when opening Heaven to those, who dying<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Deserve not death, by paths no other knows</span><br />
Points out the way, and still while she is soaring,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her scorn for crowds and humid earth she shows.</span><br />
And there's a sure reward for loyal silence.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Him I'll forbid under my roof to sit</span><br />
Who has divulged the Elusinian mysteries,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor in my fragile shallop shall he flit</span><br />
Often great Jupiter, when once neglected,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The wicked near the innocent has put,</span><br />
But punishment to overtake the guilty<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Has rarely failed, though she is lame of foot</span><br />

Oh! Ship of State! fresh billows to sea will bear thee back,<br />
Then turn about and bravely toward the harbor tack,<br />
Thou see'st that thy naked sides defending oarsmen lack.<br />

Behold! thy mast lies shattered before the swift south wind,<br />
Listen! the yards are creaking, the ropes no longer bind,<br />
Strength to endure the boisterous waves thy keel can hardly find.<br />

Now all thy sails are ragged; the gods are swept away<br />
To whom, borne down by peril, thy quaking soul would pray.<br />
Though lofty be thy lineage, its pride is vain today.<br />
<br />
The power and name thou boastest are now of no avail,<br />
Thy stern is gayly painted, and still thy seamen quail,<br />
Beware lest thou art made the sport of every idle gale.<br />
<br />
Ah! dearly loved, my country; my fond yet heavy care!<br />
Thy discords lately wearied me, but now I breathe a prayer<br />
That thee the tides of faction, the glittering rocks may spare.<br />

material from the Google Print project.)


Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
