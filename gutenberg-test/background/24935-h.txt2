PREFACE
[Pg i]

The myths and legends here gathered together have appealed
and will continue to appeal to every age. Nowhere in the
realm of fiction are there stories to compare with those which
took form centuries ago when the race was in its childhood       stories
so intimately connected with the life and history and
religion of the great peoples of antiquity that they have become
an integral part of our own civilization, a heritage of
wealth to every child that is born into the world.

The historic basis of the tales is slight; yet who can think of
the Greeks without remembering the story of Troy, or of
Rome without a backward glance at        neas, fabled founder
of the race and hero of Virgil's world-famous Latin epic?
Any understanding of German civilisation would be incomplete
without knowledge of the mythical prince Siegfried, hero of
the earliest literature of the Teutonic people, finally immortalized
in the nineteenth century through the musical dramas
of Wagner. Any understanding of English civilization would
be similarly incomplete without the semi-historic figure of
King Arthur, glorified through the accumulated legends of
the Middle Ages and made to live again in the melodic idylls
of the great Victorian laureate. And so one might go on.
In many ways the mythology and folklore of a country are a
truer index to the life of its people than any of the pages of
actual history; for through these channels the imagination
and the heart speak. All the chronicles of rulers and governing
bodies are as dust in comparison.

The imagination of the ancients had few if any bounds, and[Pg ii]
even Athens in the height of her intellectual glory accepted
the fabulous tales of gods and half-gods. Today we read and
wonder. But the child, who in his brief lifetime must live
over in part at least the history of the whole race, delights
in the myths and legends which made his ancestors admire
or tremble. They are naturally not so real to him as they
were to his forefathers; yet they open up a rich and gorgeous
wonderland, without excursions into which every child must
grow up the poorer in mind and spirit.

To the children of America, wherever they may be, this
book is dedicated. It is sure to bring enjoyment, because
its stories have stood the test of time.



Then Arthur drew out the sword and was proclaimed king.

PROMETHEUS, THE FRIEND OF MAN


Many, many centuries ago there lived two brothers,
Prometheus or Forethought, and Epimetheus or Afterthought.
They were the sons of those Titans who had fought against
Jupiter and been sent in chains to the great prison-house of
the lower world, but for some reason had escaped punishment.

Prometheus, however, did not care for idle life among the
gods on Mount Olympus. Instead he preferred to spend his
time on the earth, helping men to find easier and better ways
of living. For the children of earth were not happy as they
had been in the golden days when Saturn ruled. Indeed,
they were very poor and wretched and cold, without fire,
without food, and with no shelter but miserable caves.

       With fire they could at least warm their bodies and cook
their food,        Prometheus thought,        and later they could make
tools and build houses for themselves and enjoy some of the
comforts of the gods.       

So Prometheus went to Jupiter and asked that he might
be permitted to carry fire to the earth. But Jupiter shook
his head in wrath.

       Fire, indeed!        he exclaimed.        If men had fire they would
soon be as strong and wise as we who dwell on Olympus.
Never will I give my consent.       

Prometheus made no reply, but he didn't give up his idea
of helping men.        Some other way must be found,        he
thought.

Then, one day, as he was walking among some reeds he
broke off one, and seeing that its hollow stalk was filled with
a dry, soft pith, exclaimed:

[Pg 8]       At last! In this I can carry fire, and the children of men
shall have the great gift in spite of Jupiter.       

Immediately, taking a long stalk in his hands, he set out for
the dwelling of the sun in the far east. He reached there in
the early morning, just as Apollo's chariot was about to begin
its journey across the sky. Lighting his reed, he hurried
back, carefully guarding the precious spark that was hidden
in the hollow stalk.

Then he showed men how to build fires for themselves,
and it was not long before they began to do all the wonderful
things of which Prometheus had dreamed. They learned to
cook and to domesticate animals and to till the fields and to
mine precious metals and melt them into tools and weapons.
And they came out of their dark and gloomy caves and built
for themselves beautiful houses of wood and stone. And
instead of being sad and unhappy they began to laugh and
sing.        Behold, the Age of Gold has come again,        they said.

But Jupiter was not so happy. He saw that men were
gaining daily greater power, and their very prosperity made
him angry.

       That young Titan!        he cried out, when he heard what
Prometheus had done.        I will punish him.       

But before punishing Prometheus he decided to vex the
children of men. So he gave a lump of clay to his blacksmith,
Vulcan, and told him to mold it in the form of a woman.
When the work was done he carried it to Olympus.

Jupiter called the other gods together, bidding them give
her each a gift. One bestowed upon her beauty, another,
kindness, another, skill, another, curiosity, and so on. Jupiter
himself gave her the gift of life, and they named her Pandora,
which means        all-gifted.       

Then Mercury, the messenger of the gods, took Pandora
and led her down the mountain side to the place where Prometheus
and his brother were living.



The hero approached the dreadful monster.




Prometheus punished for his gift to maw


[Pg 9]
       Epimetheus, here is a beautiful woman that Jupiter has
sent to be your wife,        he said.

Epimetheus was delighted and soon loved Pandora very
deeply, because of her beauty and her goodness.

Now Pandora had brought with her as a gift from Jupiter
a golden casket. Athena had warned her never to open the
box, but she could not help wondering and wondering what it
contained. Perhaps it held beautiful jewels. Why should
they go to waste?

At last she could not contain her curiosity any longer.
She opened the box just a little to take a peep inside. Immediately
there was a buzzing, whirring sound, and before she
could snap down the lid ten thousand ugly little creatures
had jumped out. They were diseases and troubles, and very
glad they were to be free.

All over the earth they flew, entering into every household,
and carrying sorrow and distress wherever they went.

How Jupiter must have laughed when he saw the result of
Pandora's curiosity!

Soon after this the god decided that it was time to punish
Prometheus. He called Strength and Force and bade them
seize the Titan and carry him to the highest peak of the
Caucasus Mountains. Then he sent Vulcan to bind him with
iron chains, making arms and feet fast to the rocks. Vulcan
was sorry for Prometheus, but dared not disobey.

So the friend of man lay, miserably bound, naked to the
winds, while the storms beat about him and an eagle tore at
his liver with its cruel talons. But Prometheus did not utter
a groan in spite of all his sufferings. Year after year he lay
in agony, and yet he would not complain, beg for mercy or
repent of what he had done. Men were sorry for him, but
could do nothing.

Then one day a beautiful white cow passed over the
mountain, and stopped to look at Prometheus with sad eyes.

[Pg 10]       I know you,        Prometheus said.        You are Io, once a
fair and happy maiden dwelling in Argos, doomed by Jupiter
and his jealous queen to wander over the earth in this guise.
Go southward and then west until you come to the great
river Nile. There you shall again become a maiden, fairer
than ever before, and shall marry the king of that country.
And from your race shall spring the hero who will break my
chains and set me free.       

Centuries passed and then a great hero, Hercules, came to
the Caucasus Mountains. He climbed the rugged peak,
slew the fierce eagle, and with mighty blows broke the chains
that bound the friend of man.

[Pg 11]
THE LABORS OF HERCULES


Before the birth of Hercules Jupiter had explained in the
council of the gods that the first descendant of Perseus should
be the ruler of all the others of his race. This honor was
intended for the son of Perseus and Alcmene; but Juno was
jealous and brought it about that Eurystheus, who was also
a descendant of Perseus, should be born before Theseus.
So Eurystheus became king in Mycene, and the later-born
Hercules remained inferior to him.

Now Eurystheus watched with anxiety the rising fame of
his young relative, and called his subject to him, demanding
that he carry through certain great tasks or labors. When
Hercules did not immediately obey, Jupiter himself sent
word to him that he should fulfill his service to the King of
Greece.

Nevertheless the hero son of a god could not make up his
mind easily to render service to a mere mortal. So he traveled
to Delhi and questioned the oracle as to what he should do.
This was the answer:

The overlordship of Eurystheus will be qualified on condition
that Hercules perform ten labors that Eurystheus shall assign
him. When this is done, Hercules shall be numbered among
the immortal gods.

Hereupon Hercules fell into deep trouble. To serve a man
of less importance than himself hurt his dignity and self-esteem;
but Jupiter would not listen to his complaints.


The First Labor

The first labor that Eurystheus assigned to Hercules was
to bring him the skin of the Nemean lion. This monster[Pg 12]
dwelt on the mountain of Peloponnesus, in the forest between
Kleona and Nemea, and could be wounded by no weapons
made of man. Some said he was the son of the giant Typhon
and the snake Echidna; others that he had dropped down from
the moon to the earth.

Hercules set out on his journey and came to Kleona, where
a poor laborer, Molorchus, received him hospitably. He met
the latter just as he was about to offer a sacrifice to Jupiter.

       Good man,        said Hercules,        let the animal live thirty
days longer; then, if I return, offer it to Jupiter, my deliverer,
and if I do not return, offer it as a funeral sacrifice to me, the
hero who has attained immortality.       

So Hercules continued on his way, his quiver of arrows over
his shoulder, his bow in one hand, and in the other a club made
from the trunk of a wild olive tree which he had passed on
Mount Helicon and pulled up by the roots. When he at
last entered the Nemean wood, he looked carefully in every
direction in order that he might catch sight of the monster
lion before the lion should see him. It was mid-day, and
nowhere could he discover any trace of the lion or any path
that seemed to lead to his lair. He met no man in the field
or in the forest: fear held them all shut up in their distant
dwellings. The whole afternoon he wandered through the
thick undergrowth, determined to test his strength just as
soon as he should encounter the lion.

At last, toward evening, the monster came through the
forest, returning from his trap in a deep fissure of the earth.

He was saturated with blood: head, mane and breast were
reeking, and his great tongue was licking his jaws. The hero,
who saw him coming long before he was near, took refuge in
a thicket and waited until the lion approached; then with his
arrow he shot him in the side. But the shot did not pierce
his flesh; instead it flew back as if it had struck stone, and
fell on the mossy earth.

[Pg 13]Then the animal raised his bloody head; looked around
in every direction, and in fierce anger showed his ugly teeth.
Raising his head, he exposed his heart, and immediately
Hercules let fly another arrow, hoping to pierce him through
the lungs. Again the arrow did not enter the flesh, but fell
at the feet of the monster.

Hercules took a third arrow, while the lion, casting his eyes
to the side, watched him. His whole neck swelled with
anger; he roared, and his back was bent like a bow. He
sprang toward his enemy; but Hercules threw the arrow and
cast off the lion skin in which he was clothed with the left
hand, while with the right he swung his club over the head
of the beast and gave him such a blow on the neck that, all
ready to spring as the lion was, he fell back, and came to a
stand on trembling legs, with shaking head. Before he could
take another breath, Hercules was upon him.

Throwing down his bow and quiver, that he might be
entirely unencumbered, he approached the animal from
behind, threw his arm around his neck and strangled him.
Then for a long time he sought in vain to strip the fallen
animal of his hide. It yielded to no weapon or no stone. At
last the idea occurred to him of tearing it with the animal's
own claws, and this method immediately succeeded.

Later he prepared for himself a coat of mail out of the lion's
skin, and from the neck, a new helmet; but for the present
he was content to don his own costume and weapons, and
with the lion's skin over his arm took his way back to Tirynth.


The Second Labor

The second labor consisted in destroying a hydra. This
monster dwelt in the swamp of Lerna, but came occasionally
over the country, destroying herds and laying waste the fields.
The hydra was an enormous creature       a serpent with nine
heads, of which eight were mortal and one immortal.

[Pg 14]Hercules set out with high courage for this fight. He
mounted his chariot, and his beloved nephew Iolaus; the son
of his stepbrother Iphicles, who for a long time had been his
inseparable companion, sat by his side, guiding the horses;
and so they sped toward Lerna.

At last the hydra was visible on a hill by the springs of
Amymone, where its lair was found. Here Iolaus left the
horses stand. Hercules leaped from the chariot and sought
with burning arrows to drive the many-headed serpent from
its hiding place. It came forth hissing, its nine heads raised
and swaying like the branches of a tree in a storm.

Undismayed, Hercules approached it, seized it, and held
it fast. But the snake wrapped itself around one of his feet.
Then he began with his sword to cut off its heads. But this
looked like an endless task, for no sooner had he cut off one
head than two grew in its place. At the same time an enormous
crab came to the help of the hydra and began biting the
hero's foot. Killing this with his club, he called to Iolaus for
help.

The latter had lighted a torch, set fire to a portion of the
nearby wood, and with brands therefrom touched the serpent's
newly growing heads and prevented them from living. In
this way the hero was at last master of the situation and was
able to cut off even the head of the hydra that could not be
killed. This he buried deep in the ground and rolled a heavy
stone over the place. The body of the hydra he cut into half,
dipping his arrows in the blood, which was poisonous.

From that time the wounds made by the arrows of Hercules
were fatal.


The Third Labor

The third demand of Eurystheus was that Hercules bring
to him alive the hind Cerynitis. This was a noble animal,[Pg 15]
with horns of gold and feet of iron. She lived on a hill in
Arcadia, and was one of the five hinds which the goddess
Diana had caught on her first hunt. This one, of all the five,
was permitted to run loose again in the woods, for it was
decreed by fate that Hercules should one day hunt her.

For a whole year Hercules pursued her; came at last to the
river Ladon; and there captured the hind, not far from the
city       non, on the mountains of Diana. But he knew of no
way of becoming master of the animal without wounding her,
so he lamed her with an arrow and then carried her over his
shoulder through Arcadia.

Here he met Diana herself with Apollo, who scolded him
for wishing to kill the animal that she had held sacred, and
was about to take it from him.

       Impiety did not move me, great goddess,        said Hercules
in his own defense,        but only the direst necessity. How
otherwise could I hold my own against Eurystheus?       

And thus he softened the anger of the goddess and brought
the animal to Mycene.


The Fourth Labor

Then Hercules set out on his fourth undertaking. It
consisted in bringing alive to Mycene a boar which, likewise
sacred to Diana, was laying waste the country around the
mountain of Erymanthus.

On his wanderings in search of this adventure he came to
the dwelling of Pholus, the son of Silenus. Like all Centaurs,
Pholus was half man and half horse. He received his guest
with hospitality and set before him broiled meat, while he
himself ate raw. But Hercules, not satisfied with this, wished
also to have something good to drink.

       Dear guest,        said Pholus,        there is a cask in my cellar;
but it belongs to all the Centaurs jointly, and I hesitate to
open it because I know how little they welcome guests.       

[Pg 16]       Open it with good courage,        answered Hercules,        I promise
to defend you against all displeasure.       

As it happened, the cask of wine had been given to the
Centaurs by Bacchus, the god of wine, with the command that
they should not open it until, after four centuries, Hercules
should appear in their midst.

Pholus went to the cellar and opened the wonderful cask.
But scarcely had he done so when the Centaurs caught the
perfume of the rare old wine, and, armed with stones and pine
clubs, surrounded the cave of Pholus. The first who tried
to force their way in Hercules drove back with brands he
seized from the fire. The rest he pursued with bow and arrow,
driving them back to Malea, where lived the good Centaur,
Chiron, Hercules' old friend. To him his brother Centaurs
had fled for protection.

But Hercules still continued shooting, and sent an arrow
through the arm of an old Centaur, which unhappily went
quite through and fell on Chiron's knee, piercing the flesh.
Then for the first time Hercules recognized his friend of
former days, ran to him in great distress, pulled out the arrow,
and laid healing ointment on the wound, as the wise Chiron
himself had taught him. But the wound, filled with the
poison of the hydra, could not be healed; so the centaur was
carried into his cave. There he wished to die in the arms of
his friend. Vain wish! The poor Centaur had forgotten that
he was immortal, and though wounded would not die.

Then Hercules with many tears bade farewell to his old
teacher and promised to send to him, no matter at what price,
the great deliverer, Death. And we know that he kept his
word.

When Hercules from the pursuit of the other Centaurs
returned to the dwelling of Pholus he found him also dead.
He had drawn the deadly arrow from the lifeless body of one[Pg 17]
Centaur, and while he was wondering how so small a thing
could do such great damage, the poisoned arrow slipped
through his fingers and pierced his foot, killing him instantly.
Hercules was very sad, and buried his body reverently beneath
the mountain, which from that day was called Pholo      .

Then Hercules continued his hunt for the boar, drove him
with cries out of the thick of the woods, pursued him into a
deep snow field, bound the exhausted animal, and brought
him, as he had been commanded, alive to Mycene.


The Fifth Labor

Thereupon King Eurystheus sent him upon the fifth labor,
which: was one little worthy of a hero. It was to clean the
stables of Augeas in a single day.

Augeas was king in Elis and had great herds of cattle. These
herds were kept, according to the custom, in a great inclosure
before the palace. Three thousand cattle were housed there,
and as the stables had not been cleaned for many years, so
much manure had accumulated that it seemed an insult to
ask Hercules to clean them in one day.

When the hero stepped before King Augeas and without
telling him anything of the demands of Eurystheus, pledged
himself to the task, the latter measured the noble form in
the lion-skin and could hardly refrain from laughing when
he thought of so worthy a warrior undertaking so menial a
work. But he said to himself:        Necessity has driven
many a brave man; perhaps this one wishes to enrich himself
through me. That will help him little. I can promise him a
large reward if he cleans out the stables, for he can in one day
clear little enough.        Then he spoke confidently:

       Listen, O stranger. If you clean all of my stables in one
day, I will give over to you the tenth part of all my possessions
in cattle.       

[Pg 18]Hercules accepted the offer, and the king expected to see
him begin to shovel. But Hercules, after he had called the
son of Augeas to witness the agreement, tore the foundations
away from one side of the stables; directed to it by means of a
canal the streams of Alpheus and Peneus that flowed near by;
and let the waters carry away the filth through another
opening. So he accomplished the menial work without
stooping to anything unworthy of an immortal.

When Augeas learned that this work had been done in the
service of Eurystheus, he refused the reward and said that he
had not promised it; but he declared himself ready to have
the question settled in court. When the judges were assembled,
Phyleus, commanded by Hercules to appear, testified against
his father, and explained how he had agreed to offer Hercules
a reward. Augeas did not wait for the decision; he grew
angry and commanded his son as well as the stranger to leave
his kingdom instantly.


The Sixth Labor

Hercules now returned with new adventures to Eurystheus;
but the latter would not give him credit for the task because
Hercules had demanded a reward for his labor. He sent the
hero forth upon a sixth adventure, commanding him to drive
away the Stymphalides. These were monster birds of prey,
as large as cranes, with iron feathers, beaks and claws. They
lived on the banks of Lake Stymphalus in Arcadia, and had
the power of using their feathers as arrows and piercing with
their beaks even bronze coats of mail. Thus they brought
destruction to both animals and men in all the surrounding
country.

After a short journey Hercules, accustomed to wandering,
arrived at the lake, which was thickly shaded by a wood.
Into this wood a great flock of the birds had flown for fear of[Pg 19]
being robbed by wolves. The hero stood undecided when he
saw the frightful crowd, not knowing how he could become
master over so many enemies. Then he felt a light touch on
his shoulder, and glancing behind him saw the tall figure
of the goddess Minerva, who gave into his hands two mighty
brass rattles made by Vulcan. Telling him to use these to
drive away the Stymphalides, she disappeared.

Hercules mounted a hill near the lake, and began frightening
the birds by the noise of the rattles. The Stymphalides could
not endure the awful noise and flew, terrified, out of the forest.
Then Hercules seized his bow and sent arrow after arrow in
pursuit of them, shooting many as they flew. Those who
were not killed left the lake and never returned.


The Seventh Labor

King Minos of Crete had promised Neptune (Poseidon),
god of the sea, to offer to him whatever animal should first
come up out of the water, for he declared he had no animal
that was worthy for so high a sacrifice. Therefore the god
caused a very beautiful ox to rise out of the sea. But the king
was so taken with the noble appearance of the animal that he
secretly placed it among his own herds and offered another
to Neptune. Angered by this, the god had caused the animal
to become mad, and it was bringing great destruction to the
island of Crete. To capture this animal, master it, and bring
it before Eurystheus, was the seventh labor of Hercules.

When the hero came to Crete and with this intention stepped
before Minos, the king was not a little pleased over the prospect
of ridding the island of the bull, and he himself helped Hercules
to capture the raging animal. Hercules approached the
dreadful monster without fear, and so thoroughly did he
master him that he rode home on the animal the whole way
to the sea.

[Pg 20]With this work Eurystheus was pleased, and after he had
regarded the animal for a time with pleasure, set it free. No
longer under Hercules' management, the ox became wild
again, wandered through all Laconia and Arcadia, crossed
over the isthmus to Marathon in Attica and devastated the
country there as formerly on the island of Crete. Later it
was given to the hero Theseus to become master over him.


The Eighth Labor

The eighth labor of Hercules was to bring the mares of the
Thracian Diomede to Mycene. Diomede was a son of Mars
and ruler of the Bistonians, a very warlike people. He had
mares so wild and strong that they had to be fastened with
iron chains. Their fodder was chiefly hay; but strangers
who had the misfortune to come into the city were thrown
before them, their flesh serving the animals as food.

When Hercules arrived the first thing he did was to seize
the inhuman king himself and after he had overpowered the
keepers, throw him before his own mares. With this food the
animals were satisfied and Hercules was able to drive them to
the sea.

But the Bistonians followed him with weapons, and Hercules
was forced to turn and fight them. He gave the horses into
the keeping of his beloved, companion Abderus, the son of
Mercury, and while Hercules was away the animals grew
hungry again and devoured their keeper.

Hercules, returning, was greatly grieved over this loss, and
later founded a city in honor of Abderus, naming it after his
lost friend. For the present he was content to master the
mares and drive them without further mishap to Eurystheus.

The latter consecrated the horses to Juno. Their
descendants were very powerful, and the great king Alexander
of Macedonia rode one of them.


[Pg 21]
The Ninth Labor

Returning from a long journey, the hero undertook an
expedition against the Amazons in order to finish the ninth
adventure and bring to King Eurystheus the sword belt of
the Amazon Hippolyta.

The Amazons inhabited the region of the river Thermodon
and were a race of strong women who followed the occupations
of men. From their children they selected only such as were
girls. United in an army, they waged great wars. Their
queen, Hippolyta, wore, as a sign of her leadership, a girdle
which the goddess of war had given her as a present.

Hercules gathered his warrior companions together into a
ship, sailed after many adventures into the Black Sea and at
last into the mouth of the river Thermodon, and the harbor
of the Amazon city Themiscira. Here the queen of the
Amazons met him.

The lordly appearance of the hero flattered her pride, and
when she heard the object of his visit, she promised him the
belt. But Juno, the relentless enemy of Hercules, assuming
the form of an Amazon, mingled among the others and spread
the news that a stranger was about to lead away their queen.
Then the Amazons fought with the warriors of Hercules, and
the best fighters of them attacked the hero and gave him a
hard battle.

The first who began fighting with him was called, because
of her swiftness, A      lla, or Bride of the Wind; but she found in
Hercules a swifter opponent, was forced to yield and was in
her swift flight overtaken by him and vanquished. A second
fell at the first attack; then Protho      , the third, who had
come off victor in seven duels, also fell. Hercules laid low
eight others, among them three hunter companions of Diana,
who, although formerly always certain with their weapons,
today failed in their aim, and vainly covering themselves with[Pg 22]
their shields fell before the arrows of the hero. Even Alkippe
fell, who had sworn to live her whole live unmarried: the vow
she kept, but not her life.

After even Melanippe, the brave leader of the Amazons,
was made captive, all the rest took to wild flight, and Hippolyta
the queen handed over the sword belt which she had promised
even before the fight. Hercules took it as ransom and set
Melanippe free.


The Tenth Labor

When the hero laid the sword belt of Queen Hippolyta at
the feet of Eurystheus, the latter gave him no rest, but sent
him out immediately to procure the cattle of the giant Geryone.
The latter dwelt on an island in the midst of the sea, and
possessed a herd of beautiful red-brown cattle; which were
guarded by another giant and a two-headed dog.

Geryone himself was enormous, had three bodies, three
heads, six arms and six feet. No son of earth had ever
measured his strength against him, and Hercules realized
exactly how many preparations were necessary for this heavy
undertaking. As everybody knew, Geryone's father, who bore
the name        Gold-Sword        because of his riches, was king of
all Iberia (Spain). Besides Geryone he had three brave giant
sons who fought for him; and each son had a mighty army of
soldiers under his command. For these very reasons had
Eurystheus given the task to Hercules, for he hoped that
his hated existence would at last be ended in a war in such a
country. Yet Hercules set out on this undertaking no more
dismayed than on any previous expedition.

He gathered together his army on the island of Crete, which
he had freed from wild animals, and landed first in Libya.
Here he met the giant Antaeus, whose strength was renewed
as often as he touched the earth. He also freed Libya of birds[Pg 23]
of prey; for he hated wild animals and wicked men because
he saw in all of them the image of the overbearing and unjust
lord whom he so long had served.

After long wandering through desert country he came at
last to a fruitful land, through which great streams flowed.
Here he founded a city of vast size, which he named Hecatompylos
(City of a Hundred Gates). Then at last he reached
the Atlantic Ocean and planted the two mighty pillars which
bear his name.

The sun burned so fiercely that Hercules could bear it no
longer; he raised his eyes to heaven and with raised bow
threatened the sun-god. Apollo wondered at his courage and
lent him for his further journeys the bark in which he himself
was accustomed to lie from sunset to sunrise. In this Hercules
sailed to Iberia.

Here he found the three sons of Gold-Sword with three great
armies camping near each other; but he killed all the leaders
and plundered the land. Then he sailed to the island Erythia,
where Geryone dwelt with his herds.

As soon as the two-headed dog knew of his approach he
sprang toward him; but Hercules struck him with his club
and killed him. He killed also the giant herdsman who came
to the help of the dog. Then he hurried away with the cattle.

But Geryone overtook him and there was a fierce struggle.
Juno herself offered to assist the giant; but Hercules shot her
with an arrow deep in the heart, and the goddess, wounded,
fled. Even the threefold body of the giant which ran together
in the region of the stomach, felt the might of the deadly
arrows and was forced to yield.

With glorious adventures Hercules continued his way home,
driving the cattle across country through Iberia and Italy.
At Rhegium in lower Italy one of his oxen got away and
swam across the strait to Sicily. Immediately Hercules[Pg 24]
drove the other cattle into the water and swam, holding one
by the horns, to Sicily. Then the hero pursued his way
without misfortune through Italy, Illyria and Thrace to Greece.

Hercules had now accomplished ten labors; but Eurystheus
was still unsatisfied and there were two more tasks to be
undertaken.


The Eleventh Labor

At the celebration of the marriage of Jupiter and Juno,
when all the gods were bringing their wedding gifts to the
happy pair, Mother Earth did not wish to be left out. So
she caused to spring forth on the western borders of the great
world-sea a many-branched tree full of golden apples. Four
maidens called the Hesperides, daughters of Night, were the
guardians of this sacred garden, and with them watched the
hundred-headed dragon, Ladon, whose father was Phorkys,
the parent of many monsters. Sleep came never to the eyes
of this dragon and a fearful hissing sound warned one of his
presence, for each of his hundred throats had a different voice.
From this monster, so was the command of Eurystheus,
should Hercules seize the golden apples.

The hero set out on his long and adventurous journey and
placed himself in the hands of blind chance, for he did not know
where the Hesperides dwelt.

He went first to Thessaly, where dwelt the giant Termerus,
who with his skull knocked to death every traveler that he
met; but on the mighty cranium of Hercules the head of the
giant himself was split open.

Farther on the hero came upon another monster in his
way, Cycnus, the son of Mars and Pyrene. He, when asked
concerning the garden of the Hesperides, instead of answering,
challenged the wanderer to a duel, and was beaten by Hercules.
Then appeared Mars, the god of war, himself, to avenge the[Pg 25]
death of his son; and Hercules was forced to fight with him.
But Jupiter did not wish that his sons should shed blood,
and sent his lightning bolt to separate the two.

Then Hercules continued his way through Illyria, hastened
over the river Eridanus, and came to the nymphs of Jupiter
and Themis, who dwelt on the banks of the stream. To these
Hercules put his question.

       Go to the old river god Nereus,        was their answer.        He
is a seer and knows all things. Surprise him while he sleeps
and bind him; then he will be forced to tell you the right
way.       

Hercules followed this advice and became master of the
river god, although the latter, according to his custom, assumed
many different forms. Hercules would not let him go until
he had learned in what locality he could find the golden apples
of the Hesperides.

Informed of this, he went on his way toward Libya and
Egypt. Over the latter land ruled Busiris, the son of Neptune
and Lysianassa. To him during the period of a nine-year
famine a prophet had borne the oracular message that the
land would again bear fruit if a stranger were sacrificed once
a year to Jupiter. In gratitude Busiris made a beginning
with the priest himself. Later he found great pleasure in the
custom and killed all strangers who came to Egypt. So
Hercules was seized and placed on the altar of Jupiter. But
he broke the chains which bound him, and killed Busiris and
his son and the priestly herald.

With many adventures the hero continued his way, set
free, as has been told elsewhere, Prometheus, the Titan, who
was bound to the Caucasus Mountains, and came at last to
the place where Atlas stood carrying the weight of the heavens
on his shoulders. Near him grew the tree which bore the golden
apples of the Hesperides.

[Pg 26]Prometheus had advised the hero not to attempt himself
to make the robbery of the golden fruit, but to send Atlas
on the errand. The giant offered to do this if Hercules would
support the heavens while he went. This Hercules consented
to do, and Atlas set out. He put to sleep the dragon who
lived beneath the tree and killed him. Then with a trick he
got the better of the keepers, and returned happily to Hercules
with the three apples which he had plucked.

       But,        he said,        I have now found out how it feels to be
relieved of the heavy burden of the heavens. I will not carry
them any longer.        Then he threw the apples down at the
feet of the hero, and left him standing with the unaccustomed,
awful weight upon his shoulders.

Hercules had to think of a trick in order to get away.
       Let me,        he said to the giant,        just make a coil of rope to
bind around my head, so that the frightful weight will not
cause my forehead to give way.       

Atlas found this new demand reasonable, and consented to
take over the burden again for a few minutes. But the deceiver
was at last deceived, and Hercules picked up the apples from
the ground and set out on his way back. He carried the
apples to Eurystheus, who, since his object of getting rid of
the hero had not been accomplished, gave them back to Hercules
as a present. The latter laid them on the altar of
Minerva; but the goddess, knowing that it was contrary to
the divine wishes to carry away this sacred fruit, returned the
apples to the garden of the Hesperides.


The Twelfth Labor

Instead of destroying his hated enemy the labors which
Eurystheus had imposed upon Hercules had only strengthened
the hero in the fame for which fate had selected him. He had
become the protector of all the wronged upon earth, and the
boldest adventurer among mortals.

[Pg 27]But the last labor he was to undertake in the region in
which his hero strength       so the impious king hoped       would
not accompany him. This was a fight with the dark powers
of the underworld. He was to bring forth from Hades Cerberus,
the dog of Hell. This animal had three heads with
frightful jaws, from which incessantly poison flowed. A
dragon's tail hung from his body, and the hair of his head and
of his back formed hissing, coiling serpents.

To prepare himself for this fearful journey Hercules went
to the city of Eleusis, in Attic territory, where, from a wise
priest, he received secret instruction in the things of the upper
and lower world, and where also he received pardon for the
murder of the Centaur.

Then, with strength to meet the horrors of the underworld,
Hercules traveled on to Peloponnesus, and to the Laconian
city of Taenarus, which contained the opening to the lower
world. Here, accompanied by Mercury, he descended through
a cleft in the earth, and came to the entrance of the city of
King Pluto. The shades which sadly wandered back and
forth before the gates of the city took flight as soon as they
caught sight of flesh and blood in the form of a living man.
Only the Gorgon Medusa and the spirit of Meleager remained.
The former Hercules wished to overthrow with his sword,
but Mercury touched him on the arm and told him that the
souls of the departed were only empty shadow pictures and
could not be wounded by mortal weapons.

With the soul of Meleager the hero chatted in friendly
fashion, and received from him loving messages for the
upper world. Still nearer to the gates of Hades Hercules
caught sight of his friends Theseus and Pirithous. When both
saw the friendly form of Hercules they stretched beseeching
hands towards him, trembling with the hope that through his
strength they might again reach the upper world. Hercules[Pg 28]
grasped Theseus by the hand, freed him from his chains and
raised him from the ground. A second attempt to free Pirithous
did not succeed, for the ground opened beneath his feet.

At the gate of the City of the Dead stood King Pluto, and
denied entrance to Hercules. But with an arrow the hero
shot the god in the shoulder, so that he feared the mortal;
and when Hercules then asked whether he might lead away
the dog of Hades he did not longer oppose him. But he
imposed the condition that Hercules should become master
of Cerberus without using any weapons. So the hero set out,
protected only with cuirass and the lion skin.

He found the dog camping near the dwelling of Acheron,
and without paying any attention to the bellowing of the
three heads, which was like the echo of fearful resounding
thunder, he seized the dog by the legs, put his arms around
his neck, and would not let him go, although the dragon tail
of the animal bit him in the cheek.

He held the neck of Cerberus firm, and did not let go
until he was really master of the monster. Then he raised
it, and through another opening of Hades returned in happiness
to his own country. When the dog of Hades saw the light of
day he was afraid and began to spit poison, from which
poisonous plants sprung up out of the earth. Hercules brought
the monster in chains to Tirynth, and led it before the astonished
Eurystheus, who could not believe his eyes.

Now at last the king doubted whether he could ever rid
himself of the hated son of Jupiter. He yielded to his fate
and dismissed the hero, who led the dog of Hades back to his
owner in the lower world.

Thus Hercules after all his labors was at last set free from
the service of Eurystheus, and returned to Thebes.

DEUCALION AND PYRRHA


While the men of the Age of Bronze still dwelt upon the
earth reports of their wickedness were carried to Jupiter.
The god decided to verify the reports by coming to earth
himself in the form of a man, and everywhere he went he found
that the reports were much milder than the truth.

One evening in the late twilight he entered the inhospitable
shelter of the Arcadian King Lycaon, who was famed for his
wild conduct. By several signs he let it be known that he
was a god, and the crowd dropped to their knees; but Lycaon
made light of the pious prayers.

       Let us see,        he said,        whether he is a mortal or a god.       

Thereupon he decided to destroy the guest that night while
he lay in slumber, not expecting death. But before doing so
he killed a poor hostage whom the Molossians had sent to
him, cooked the half-living limbs in boiling water or broiled
them over a fire, and placed them on the table before the guest
for his evening meal.

But Jupiter, who knew all this, left the table and sent a
raging fire over the castle of the godless man. Frightened,
the king fled into the open field. The first cry he uttered was
a howl; his garments changed to fur; his arms to legs; he
was transformed into a blood-thirsty wolf.

Jupiter returned to Olympus, held counsel with the gods and
decided to destroy the reckless race of men. At first he wanted
to turn his lightnings over all the earth, but the fear that the
ether would take fire and destroy the axle of the universe
restrained him. He laid aside the thunderbolt which the
Cyclops had fashioned for him, and decided to send rain from
heaven over all the earth and so destroy the race of mortals.

[Pg 30]Immediately the North Wind and all the other cloud-scattering
winds were locked in the cave of Aeolus, and only
the South Wind sent out. The latter descended upon the
earth; his frightful face was covered with darkness; his
beard was heavy with clouds; from his white hair ran the
flood; mists lay upon his brow; from his bosom dropped the
water. The South Wind grasped the heavens, seized in his
hands the surrounding clouds and began to squeeze them.
The thunder rolled; floods of rain burst from the heavens.
The standing corn was bent to the earth; destroyed was the
hope of the farmer; destroyed the weary work of a whole
year.

Even Neptune, god of the sea, came to the assistance of
his brother Jupiter in the work of destruction. He called
all the rivers together and said,        Give full rein to your torrents;
enter houses; break through all dams!       

They followed his command, and Neptune himself struck the
earth with his trident and let the flood enter. Then the
waters streamed over the open meadows, covered the fields, dislodged
trees, temples and houses. Wherever a palace stood,
its gables were soon covered with water and the highest
turrets were hidden in the torrent. Sea and earth were no
longer divided; all was flood       an unbroken stretch of water.

Men tried to save themselves as best they could; some
climbed the high mountains; others entered boats and rowed,
now over the roofs of the fallen houses, now over the hills of
their ruined vineyards. Fish swam among the branches of
the highest trees; the wild boar was caught in the flood;
people were swept away by the water and those whom the
flood spared died of hunger on the barren mountains.

One high mountain in the country of Phocis still raised two
peaks above the surrounding waters. It was the great Mount
Parnassus. Toward this floated a boat containing Deucalion,[Pg 31]
the son of Prometheus, and his wife Pyrrha. No man, no
woman, had ever been found who surpassed these in righteousness
and piety. When, therefore, Jupiter, looking down from
heaven upon the earth, saw that only a single pair of mortals
remained of the many thousand times a thousand, both
blameless, both devoted servants of the gods, he sent forth the
North Wind, recalled the clouds, and once again separated
the earth from the heavens and the heavens from the earth.

Even Neptune, lord of the sea, laid down his trident and
calmed the flood. The ocean resumed its banks; the rivers
returned to their beds; forests stretched their slime-covered
tree-tops out of the deep; hills followed; finally stretches of
level land appeared and the earth was as before.

Deucalion looked around him. The country was laid waste;
it was wrapped in the silence of the grave. Tears rolled down
his cheeks and he said to his wife, Pyrrha,        Beloved, solitary
companion of my life, as far as I can see through all the
surrounding country, I can discover no living creature. We
two must people the earth; all the rest have been drowned
by the flood. But even we are not yet certain of our lives.
Every cloud that I see strikes terror to my soul. And even
if danger is past, what shall we do alone on the forsaken
earth? Oh, that my father Prometheus had taught me the
art of creating men and breathing life into them!       

Then the two began to weep. They threw themselves on
their knees before the half-destroyed altar of the goddess
Themis, and began to pray, saying,        Tell us? O goddess, by
what means we can replace the race that has disappeared?
Oh, help the earth to new life.       

       Leave my altar,        sounded the voice of the goddess.
       Uncover your heads, ungird your garments and cast the
bones of your mother behind you.       

For a long time Deucalion and Pyrrha wondered over the[Pg 32]
puzzling words of the goddess. Pyrrha was the first to break
the silence.        Pardon me, O noble goddess,        she said,        if I
do not obey you and cannot consent to scatter the bones of
my mother.       

Then Deucalion had a happy thought. He comforted his
wife.        Either my reason deceives me,        he said,        or the
command of the goddess is good and involves no impiety.
The great mother of all of us is the Earth; her bones are the
stones, and these, Pyrrha, we will cast behind us!       

Both mistrusted this interpretation of the words, but what
harm would it do to try? Thereupon they uncovered their
heads, ungirded their garments and began casting stones
behind them.

Then a wonderful thing happened. The stone began to
lose its hardness, became malleable, grew and took form       not
definite at once, but rude figures such as an artist first hews out
of the rough marble. Whatever was moist or earthy in the
stones was changed into flesh; the harder parts became bones;
the veins in the rock remained as veins in the bodies. Thus,
in a little while, with the aid of the gods, the stones which
Deucalion threw assumed the form of men; those which Pyrrha
threw, the form of women.

This homely origin the race of men does not deny; they
are a hardy people, accustomed to work. Every moment
of the day they remember from what sturdy stock they have
sprung.

[Pg 33]
THESEUS AND THE CENTAUR


Theseus, the hero king of Athens, had a reputation for great
strength and bravery; but Pirithous, the son of Ixion, one of
the most famous heroes of antiquity, wished to put him to the
test. He therefore drove the cattle which belonged to Theseus
away from Marathon, and when he heard that Theseus,
weapon in hand, was following him, then, indeed, he had what
he desired. He did not flee, but turned around to meet him.

When the two heroes were near enough to see each other,
each was so filled with admiration for the beautiful form and
the bravery of his opponent that, as if at a given signal, both
threw down their weapons and hastened toward each other.
Pirithous extended his hand to Theseus and proposed that the
latter act as arbitrator for the settlement of the dispute about
the cattle: whatever satisfaction Theseus would demand
Pirithous would willingly give.

       The only satisfaction which I desire,        answered Pirithous,
       is that you instead of my enemy become my friend and
comrade in arms.       

Then the two heroes embraced each other and swore eternal
friendship.

Soon after this Pirithous chose the Thessalian princess,
Hippodamia, from the race of Lapith       , for his bride, and
invited Theseus to the wedding. The Lapith       , among whom
the ceremony took place, were a famous family of Thessalians,
rugged mountaineers, in some respects resembling animals       the
first mortals who had learned to manage a horse. But
the bride, who had sprung from this race, was not at all like
the men of her people. She was of noble form, with delicate,[Pg 34]
youthful face, so beautiful that all the guests praised Pirithous
for his good fortune.

The assembled princes of Thessaly were at the wedding
feast, and also the Centaurs, relatives of Pirithous. The
Centaurs were half men; the offspring which a cloud, assuming
the form of the goddess Hera, had born to Ixion, the father of
Pirithous. They were the eternal enemies of the Lapith       .
Upon this occasion, however, and for the sake of the bride,
they had forgotten past grudges and come together to the
joyful celebration. The noble castle of Pirithous resounded
with glad tumult; bridal songs were sung; wine and food
abounded. Indeed, there were so many guests that the palace
would not accommodate all. The Lapith        and Centaurs
sat at a special table in a grotto shaded by trees.

For a long time the festivities went on with undisturbed
happiness. Then the wine began to stir the heart of the wildest
of the Centaurs, Eurytion, and the beauty of the Princess
Hippodamia awoke in him the mad desire of robbing the
bridegroom of his bride. Nobody knew how it came to pass;
nobody noticed the beginning of the unthinkable act; but
suddenly the guests saw the wild Eurytion lifting Hippodamia
from her feet, while she struggled and cried for help. His deed
was the signal for the rest of the drunken Centaurs to do likewise,
and before the strange heroes and the Lapith        could
leave their places, every one of the Centaurs had roughly
seized one of the Thessalian princesses who served at the court
of the king or who had assembled as guests at the wedding.

The castle and the grotto resembled a besieged city; the
cry of the women sounded far and wide. Quickly friends and
relatives sprang from their places.

       What delusion is this, Eurytion,        cried Theseus,        to vex
Pirithous while I still live, and by so doing arouse the anger
of two heroes?        With these words he forced his way through
the crowd and tore the stolen bride from the struggling robber.

[Pg 35]Eurytion said nothing, for he could not excuse his deed,
but he lifted his hand toward Theseus and gave him a rough
knock in the chest. Then Theseus, who had no weapon at
hand, seized an iron jug of embossed workmanship which
stood near by and flung it into the face of his opponent with
such force that the Centaur fell backward on the ground,
while brains and blood oozed from the wound in his head.

       To arms!        the cry arose from all sides. At first beakers,
flasks and bowls flew back and forth. Then one sacrilegious
monster grabbed the oblations from the neighboring apartments.
Another tore down the lamp which burned over the
table, while still another fought with a sacrificial deer which
had hung on one side of the grotto. A frightful slaughter
ensued. Rhoetus, the most wicked of the Centaurs after
Eurytion, seized the largest brand from the altar and thrust
it into the gaping wound of one of the fallen Lapith       , so that
the blood hissed like iron in a furnace. In opposition to him
rose Dryas, the bravest of the Lapith       , and seizing a glowing
log from the fire, thrust it into the Centaur's neck. The fate
of this Centaur atoned for the death of his fallen companion,
and Dryas turned to the raging mob and laid five of them low.

Then the spear of the brave hero Pirithous flew forth and
pierced a mighty Centaur, Petraus, just as he was about to
uproot a tree to use it for a club. The spear pinned him
against the knotted oak. A second, Dictys, fell at the stroke
of the Greek hero, and in falling snapped off a mighty ash
tree; a third, wishing to avenge him, was crushed by Theseus
with an oak club.

The most beautiful and youthful of the Centaurs was Cyllarus.
His long hair and beard were golden; his smile was
friendly; his neck, shoulders, hands and breast were as beautiful
as if formed by an artist. Even the lower part of his body,
the part which resembled a horse, was faultless, pitch-black in[Pg 36]
color, with legs and tail of lighter dye. He had come to the
feast with his wife, the beautiful Centaur, Hylonome, who at
the table had leaned gracefully against him and even now
united with him in the raging fight. He received from an
unknown hand a light wound near his heart, and sank dying
in the arms of his wife. Hylonome nursed his dying form,
kissed him and tried to retain the fleeting breath. When she
saw that he was gone she drew a dagger from her breast and
stabbed herself.

For a long time still the fight between the Lapith        and
the Centaurs continued; but at last night put an end to the
tumult. Then Pirithous remained in undisturbed possession
of his bride, and on the following morning Theseus departed,
bidding farewell to his friend. The common fight had quickly
welded the fresh tie of their brotherhood into an indestructible
bond.

[Pg 37]
NIOBE


Niobe, Queen of Thebes, was proud of many things. Amphion,
her husband, had received from the Muses a wonderful
lyre, to the music of which the stones of the royal palace had
of themselves assumed place. Her father was Tantalus,
who had been entertained by the gods; and she herself was
the ruler of a powerful kingdom and a woman of great pride
of spirit and majestic beauty. But of none of these things
was she so proud as she was of her fourteen lovely children,
the seven sons and seven daughters to whom she had given
birth.

Indeed, Niobe was the happiest of all mothers, and so would
she have remained if she had not believed herself so peculiarly
blessed. Her very knowledge of her good fortune was her
undoing.

One day the prophetess Manto, daughter of the soothsayer
Tiresias, being instructed of the gods, called together the
women of Thebes to do honor to the goddess Latona and her
two children, Apollo and Diana.        Put laurel wreaths upon
your heads,        were her commands,        and bring sacrifices with
pious prayers.       

Then while the women of Thebes were gathering together,
Niobe came forth, clad in a gold-embroidered garment, with
a crowd of followers, radiant in her beauty, though angry,
with her hair flowing about her shoulders. She stopped in
the midst of the busy women, and raising her voice, spoke to
them.

       Are you not foolish to worship gods of whom stories are
told to you when more favored beings dwell here among you?[Pg 38]
While you are making sacrifices on the altar of Latona, why
does my divine name remain unknown? My father Tantalus
is the only mortal who has ever sat at the table of the gods,
and my mother Dione is the sister of the Pleiades, who as
bright stars shine nightly in the heavens. One of my uncles is
the giant Atlas, who on his neck supports the vaulted heavens;
my grandfather is Jupiter, the father of the gods. The people
of Phrygia obey me, and to me and my husband belongs the
city of Cadmus, the walls of which were put together by the
music that my husband played. Every corner of my palace
is filled with priceless treasures; and there, too, are other
treasures       children such as no other mother can show: seven
beautiful daughters, seven sturdy sons, and just as many sons-
and daughters-in-law. Ask now whether I have ground for
pride. Consider again before you honor more than me Latona,
the unknown daughter of the Titans, who could find no place
in the whole earth in which she might rest and give birth to
her children until the island of Delos in compassion offered
her a precarious shelter. There she became the mother of
two children       the poor creature! Just the seventh part of
my mother joy! Who can deny that I am fortunate? Who
will doubt that I shall remain happy? Fortune would have a
hard time if she undertook to shatter my happiness. Take
this or that one from my treasured children; but when would
the number of them dwindle to the sickly two of Latona?
Away with your sacrifices! Take the laurel out of your hair.
Go back to your homes and let me never see such foolishness
again!       

Frightened at the outburst, the women removed the wreaths
from their heads, left their sacrifices and slunk home, still
honoring Latona with silent prayer.

On the summit of the Delian mountain Cynthas stood
Latona with her two children, watching what was taking[Pg 39]
place in distant Thebes.        See, my children,        she said,        I,
your mother, who am so proud of your birth, who yield place
to no goddess except Juno, I am held up to ridicule by an
upstart mortal, and if you do not defend me, my children,
I shall be driven away from the ancient and holy altars. Yes,
you too are insulted by Niobe, and she would like to have you
set aside for her children!       

Latona was about to go on, but Apollo interrupted her:
       Cease your lamentations, mother; you only delay the
punishment.       

Then he and his sister wrapped themselves in a magic
cloud cloak that made them invisible, and flew swiftly through
the air until they reached the town and castle of Cadmus.

Just outside the walls of the city was an open field that was
used as a race-course and practice ground for horses. Here
the seven sons of Amphion were amusing themselves, when
suddenly the oldest dropped his reins with a cry and fell from
his horse, pierced to the heart by an arrow. One after another
the whole seven were struck down.

The news of the disaster soon spread through the city.
Amphion, when he heard that all his sons had perished, fell
on his own sword. Then the loud cries of his servants penetrated
to the women's quarters.

For a long time Niobe could not believe that the gods had
thus brought vengeance. When she did, how unlike was she
to the Niobe who drove the people from the altars of the
mighty goddess and strode through the city with haughty
mien. Crazed with grief she rushed out to the field where her
sons had been stricken, threw herself on their dead bodies,
kissing now this one and now that. Then, raising her arms
to heaven, she cried,        Look now upon my distress, thou cruel
Latona; for the death of these seven bows me to the earth.
Triumph thou, O my victorious enemy!       

[Pg 40]Now the seven daughters of Niobe, clad in garments of
mourning, drew near, and with loosened hair stood around
their brothers. And the sight of them brought a ray of joy
to Niobe's white face. She forgot her grief for a moment,
and casting a scornful look to heaven, said,        Victor! No, for
even in my loss I have more than thou in thy happiness!       

Hardly had she spoken when there was the sound of a drawn
bow. The bystanders grew cold with fear, but Niobe was not
frightened, for misfortune had made her strong.

Suddenly one of the sisters put her hand to her breast and
drew out an arrow that had pierced her; then, unconscious,
she sank to the ground. Another daughter hastened to her
mother to comfort her, but before she could reach her she was
laid low by a hidden wound. One after another the rest fell,
until only the last was left. She had fled to Niobe's lap and
childlike was hiding her face in her mother's garments.

       Leave me only this one,        cried Niobe,        just the youngest
of so many.       

But even while she prayed the child fell lifeless from her
lap, and Niobe sat alone among the dead bodies of her husband,
her sons and her daughters. She was speechless with grief;
no breath of air stirred the hair on her head; the blood left
her face; the eyes remained fixed on the grief-stricken countenance;
in the whole body there was no longer any sign of life.
The veins ceased to carry blood; the neck stiffened; arms and
feet grew rigid; the whole body was transformed into cold and
lifeless stone. Nothing living remained to her except her
tears, which continued flowing from her stony eyes.

Then a mighty wind lifted the image of stone, carried it
over the sea and set it down in Lydia, the old home of Niobe,
in the barren mountains under the stony cliffs of Sipylus.
Here Niobe remained fixed as a marble statue on the summit
of the mountain, and to this very day you can see the grief-stricken
mother in tears.

Perseus slaying the medusa

[Pg 41]
THE GORGON'S HEAD


Perseus was the son of Dana      , who was the daughter
of a king. And when Perseus was a very little boy, some
wicked people put his mother and himself into a chest and set
them afloat upon the sea. The wind blew freshly and drove
the chest away from the shore, and the uneasy billows tossed
it up and down; while Dana       clasped her child closely to her
bosom, and dreaded that some big wave would dash its foamy
crest over them both. The chest sailed on, however, and
neither sank nor was upset, until, when night was coming,
it floated so near an island that it got entangled in a fisherman's
nets and was drawn out high and dry upon the sand. This
island was called Seriphus and it was reigned over by King
Polydectes, who happened to be the fisherman's brother.

This fisherman, I am glad to tell you, was an exceedingly
humane and upright man. He showed great kindness to
Dana       and her little boy, and continued to befriend them
until Perseus had grown to be a handsome youth, very strong
and active and skilful in the use of arms. Long before this
time King Polydectes had seen the two strangers       the mother
and her child       who had come to his dominions in a floating
chest. As he was not good and kind, like his brother the
fisherman, but extremely wicked, he resolved to send Perseus
on a dangerous enterprise, in which he would probably be
killed, and then to do some great mischief to Dana       herself.
So this bad-hearted king spent a long while in considering
what was the most dangerous thing that a young man could
possibly undertake to perform. At last, having hit upon an
enterprise that promised to turn out as fatally as he desired,
he sent for the youthful Perseus.

[Pg 42]The young man came to the palace and found the king
sitting upon his throne.

       Perseus,        said King Polydectes, smiling craftily upon
him,        you are grown up a fine young man. You and your
good mother have received a great deal of kindness from
myself, as well as from my worthy brother the fisherman,
and I suppose you would not be sorry to repay some of it.       

       Please, your Majesty,        answered Perseus,        I would
willingly risk my life to do so.       

       Well, then,        continued the king, still with a cunning smile
on his lips,        I have a little adventure to propose to you, and
as you are a brave and enterprising youth, you will doubtless
look upon it as a great piece of good luck to have so rare an
opportunity of distinguishing yourself. You must know, my
good Perseus, I think of getting married to the beautiful
Princess Hippodamia, and it is customary on these occasions
to make the bride a present of some far-fetched and elegant
curiosity. I have been a little perplexed, I must honestly
confess, where to obtain anything likely to please a princess
of her exquisite taste. But this morning, I flatter myself,
I have thought of precisely the article.       

       And can I assist your Majesty in obtaining it?        cried
Perseus, eagerly.

       You can if you are as brave a youth as I believe you to be,       
replied King Polydectes with the utmost graciousness of manner.
       The bridal gift which I have set my heart on presenting
to the beautiful Hippodamia is the head of the Gorgon Medusa
with the snaky locks; and I depend on you, my dear Perseus,
to bring it to me. So, as I am anxious to settle affairs with
the princess, the sooner you go in quest of the Gorgon, the
better I shall be pleased.       

       I will set out tomorrow morning,        answered Perseus.

       Pray do so, my gallant youth,        rejoined the king.        And,[Pg 43]
Perseus, in cutting off the Gorgon's head, be careful to make a
clean stroke, so as not to injure its appearance. You must
bring it home in the very best condition in order to suit the
exquisite taste of the beautiful Princess Hippodamia.       

Perseus left the palace, but was scarcely out of hearing
before Polydectes burst into a laugh, being greatly amused,
wicked king that he was, to find how readily the young man fell
into the snare. The news quickly spread abroad that Perseus
had undertaken to cut off the head of Medusa with the snaky
locks. Everybody was rejoiced, for most of the inhabitants
of the island were as wicked as the king himself and would
have liked nothing better than to see some enormous mischief
happen to Dana       and her son. The only good man in this
unfortunate island of Seriphus appears to have been the
fisherman. As Perseus walked along, therefore, the people
pointed after him and made mouths, and winked to one
another and ridiculed him as loudly as they dared.

       Ho, ho!        cried they;        Medusa's snakes will sting him
soundly!       

Now, there were three Gorgons alive at that period, and
they were the most strange and terrible monsters that had
ever been since the world was made, or that have been seen
in after days, or that are likely to be seen in all time to come.
I hardly know what sort of creature or hobgoblin to call them.
They were three sisters and seem to have borne some distant
resemblance to women, but were really a very frightful and
mischievous species of dragon. It is, indeed, difficult to imagine
what hideous beings these three sisters were. Why,
instead of locks of hair, if you can believe men, they had
each of them a hundred enormous snakes growing on their
heads, all alive, twisting, wriggling, curling and thrusting
out their venomous tongues, with forked stings at the end!
The teeth of the Gorgons were terribly long tusks, their hands[Pg 44]
were made of brass, and their bodies were all over scales,
which, if not iron, were something as hard and impenetrable.
They had wings, too, and exceedingly splendid ones, I can
assure you, for every feather in them was pure, bright, glittering,
burnished gold; and they looked very dazzling, no doubt,
when the Gorgons were flying about in the sunshine.

But when people happened to catch a glimpse of their
glittering brightness, aloft in the air, they seldom stopped to
gaze, but ran and hid themselves as speedily as they could.
You will think, perhaps, that they were afraid of being stung
by the serpents that served the Gorgons instead of hair       or
of having their heads bitten off by their ugly tusks       or of
being torn all to pieces by their brazen claws. Well, to be
sure, these were some of the dangers, but by no means the
greatest nor the most difficult to avoid. For the worst thing
about these abominable Gorgons was that if once a poor
mortal fixed his eyes full upon one of their faces, he was
certain that very instant to be changed from warm flesh and
blood into cold and lifeless stone!

Thus, as you will easily perceive, it was a very dangerous
adventure that the wicked King Polydectes had contrived
for this innocent young man. Perseus himself, when he had
thought over the matter, could not help seeing that he had
very little chance of coming safely through it, and that he
was far more likely to become a stone image than to bring
back the head of Medusa with the snaky locks. For, not to
speak of other difficulties, there was one which it would have
puzzled an older man than Perseus to get over. Not only
must he fight with and slay this golden-winged, iron-scaled,
long-tusked, brazen-clawed, snaky-haired monster, but he
must do it with his eyes shut, or, at least, without so much as
a glance at the enemy with whom he was contending. Else,
while his arm was lifted to strike, he would stiffen into stone[Pg 45]
and stand with that uplifted arm for centuries, until time and
the wind and weather should crumble him quite away. This
would be a very sad thing to befall a young man who wanted
to perform a great many brave deeds and to enjoy a great
deal of happiness in this bright and beautiful world.

So disconsolate did these thoughts make him that Perseus
could not bear to tell his mother what he had undertaken to
do. He therefore took his shield, girded on his sword and
crossed over from the island to the mainland, where he sat
down in a solitary place and hardly refrained from shedding
tears.

But while he was in this sorrowful mood, he heard a voice
close beside him.

       Perseus,        said the voice,        why are you sad?       

He lifted his head from his hands, in which he had hidden it,
and behold! all alone as Perseus had supposed himself to be,
there was a stranger in the solitary place. It was a brisk,
intelligent and remarkably shrewd-looking young man, with a
cloak over his shoulders, an odd sort of cap on his head, a
strangely twisted staff in his hand and a short and very crooked
sword hanging by his side. He was exceedingly light and
active in his figure, like a person much accustomed to gymnastic
exercises and well able to leap or run. Above all, the stranger
had such a cheerful, knowing and helpful aspect (though
it was certainly a little mischievous, into the bargain) that
Perseus could not help feeling his spirits grow livelier as he
gazed at him. Besides, being really a courageous youth, he
felt greatly ashamed that anybody should have found him with
tears in his eyes like a timid little schoolboy, when, after all,
there might be no occasion for despair. So Perseus wiped
his eyes and answered the stranger pretty briskly, putting
on as brave a look as he could.

       I am not so very sad,        said he,        only thoughtful about
an adventure that I have undertaken.       

[Pg 46]       Oho!        answered the stranger.        Well, tell me all about
it and possibly I may be of service to you. I have helped a
good many young men through adventures that looked difficult
enough beforehand. Perhaps you may have heard of me.
I have more names than one, but the name of Quicksilver suits
me as well as any other. Tell me what the trouble is and we
will talk the matter over and see what can be done.       

The stranger's words and manner put Perseus into quite a
different mood from his former one. He resolved to tell
Quicksilver all his difficulties, since he could not easily be
worse off than he already was, and, very possibly, his new
friend might give him some advice that would turn out well
in the end. So he let the stranger know in few words precisely
what was the case       how the King Polydectes wanted the head
of Medusa with the snaky locks as a bridal gift for the beautiful
Princess Hippodamia and how that he had undertaken
to get it for him, but was afraid of being turned into stone.

       And that would be a great pity,        said Quicksilver, with
his mischievous smile.        You would make a very handsome
marble statue, it is true, and it would be a considerable
number of centuries before you crumbled away; but, on the
whole, one would rather be a young man for a few years
than a stone image for a great many.       

       Oh, far rather!        exclaimed Perseus, with the tears again
standing in his eyes.        And, besides, what would my dear
mother do if her beloved son were turned into a stone?       

       Well, well, let us hope that the affair will not turn out
so very badly,        replied Quicksilver in an encouraging tone.
       I am the very person to help you, if anybody can. My
sister and myself will do our utmost to bring you safe through
the adventure, ugly as it now looks.       

       Your sister?        repeated Perseus.

       Yes, my sister,        said the stranger.        She is very wise,[Pg 47]
I promise you; and as for myself, I generally have all my wits
about me, such as they are. If you show yourself bold and
cautious, and follow our advice, you need not fear being a
stone image yet awhile. But, first of all, you must polish
your shield till you can see your face in it as distinctly as in a
mirror.       

This seemed to Perseus rather an odd beginning of the
adventure, for he thought it of far more consequence that
the shield should be strong enough to defend him from the
Gorgon's brazen claws than that it should be bright enough
to show him the reflection of his face. However, concluding
that Quicksilver knew better than himself, he immediately
set to work and scrubbed the shield with so much diligence
and good will that it very quickly shone like the moon at
harvest time. Quicksilver looked at it with a smile and
nodded his approbation. Then taking off his own short and
crooked sword, he girded it about Perseus, instead of the one
which he had before worn.

       No sword but mine will answer your purpose,        observed
he;        the blade has a most excellent temper and will cut
through iron and brass as easily as through the slenderest
twig. And now we will set out. The next thing is to find
the Three Gray Women, who will tell us where to find the
Nymphs.       

       The Three Gray Women!        cried Perseus, to whom this
seemed only a new difficulty in the path of his adventure.
       Pray, who may the Three Gray Women be? I never heard
of them before.       

       They are three very strange old ladies,        said Quicksilver,
laughing.        They have but one eye among them, and only
one tooth. Moreover, you must find them out by starlight
or in the dusk of the evening, for they never show themselves
by the light either of the sun or moon.       

[Pg 48]       But,        said Perseus,        why should I waste my time with
these Three Gray Women? Would it not be better to set
out at once in search of the terrible Gorgons?       

       No, no,        answered his friend.        There are other things
to be done before you can find your way to the Gorgons.
There is nothing for it but to hunt up these old ladies; and
when we meet with them, you may be sure that the Gorgons
are not a great way off. Come, let us be stirring!       

Perseus by this time felt so much confidence in his companion's
sagacity that he made no more objections, and professed
himself ready to begin the adventure immediately. They
accordingly set out and walked at a pretty brisk pace; so
brisk, indeed, that Perseus found it rather difficult to keep
up with his nimble friend Quicksilver. To say the truth, he
had a singular idea that Quicksilver was furnished with a
pair of winged shoes, which, of course, helped him along
marvelously. And then, too, when Perseus looked sideways
at him out of the corner of his eye, he seemed to see wings on
the side of his head; although, if he turned a full gaze, there
were no such things to be perceived, but only an odd kind of
cap. But at all events, the twisted staff was evidently a
great convenience to Quicksilver, and enabled him to proceed
so fast that Perseus, though a remarkably active young man,
began to be out of breath.

       Here!        cried Quicksilver at last       for he knew well enough,
rogue that he was, how hard Perseus found it to keep pace
with him-.       take you the staff, for you need it a great deal
more than I. Are there no better walkers than yourself in
the island of Seriphus?       

       I could walk pretty well,        said Perseus, glancing slyly at
his companion's feet,        if I had only a pair of winged shoes.       

       We must see about getting you a pair,        answered Quicksilver.

[Pg 49]But the staff helped Perseus along so bravely that he no
longer felt the slightest weariness. In fact, the stick seemed
to be alive in his hand and to lend some of its life to Perseus.
He and Quicksilver now walked onward at their ease, talking
very sociably together; and Quicksilver told so many pleasant
stories about his former adventures and how well his wits
had served him on various occasions that Perseus began to
think him a very wonderful person. He evidently knew the
world; and nobody is so charming to a young man as a friend
who has that kind of knowledge. Perseus listened the more
eagerly, in the hope of brightening his own wits by what he
heard.

At last, he happened to recollect that Quicksilver had
spoken of a sister who was to lend her assistance in the adventure
which they were now bound upon.

       Where is she?        he inquired.        Shall we not meet her soon?       

       All at the proper time,        said his companion.        But this
sister of mine, you must understand, is quite a different sort
of character from myself. She is very grave and prudent,
seldom smiles, never laughs and makes it a rule not to utter
a word unless she has something particularly profound to say.
Neither will she listen to any but the wisest conversation.       

       Dear me!        ejaculated Perseus;        I shall be afraid to say
a syllable.       

       She is a very accomplished person, I assure you,        continued
Quicksilver,        and has all the arts and science at her
fingers' ends. In short, she is so immoderately wise that
many people call her wisdom personified. But to tell you the
truth, she has hardly vivacity enough for my taste; and I
think you would scarcely find her so pleasant a traveling
companion as myself. She has her good points, nevertheless;
and you will find the benefit of them in your encounter with
the Gorgons.       

[Pg 50]By this time it had grown quite dusk. They were now
come to a very wild and desert place, overgrown with shaggy
bushes and so silent and solitary that nobody seemed ever
to have dwelt or journeyed there. All was waste and desolate
in the gray twilight, which grew every moment more obscure.
Perseus looked about him rather disconsolately and asked
Quicksilver whether they had a great deal farther to go.

       Hist! hist!        whispered his companion.        Make no noise!
This is just the time and place to meet the Three Gray Women.
Be careful that they do not see you before you see them, for
though they have but a single eye among the three, it is as
sharp-sighted as half a dozen common eyes.       

       But what must I do,        asked Perseus,        when we meet
them?       

Quicksilver explained to Perseus how the Three Gray Women
managed with their one eye. They were in the habit, it seems,
of changing it from one to another, as if it had been a pair
of spectacles, or       which would have suited them better       a
quizzing glass. When one of the three had kept the eye a
certain time, she took it out of the socket and passed it to one
of her sisters, whose turn it might happen to be, and who
immediately clapped it into her own head and enjoyed a
peep at the visible world. Thus it will easily be understood
that only one of the Three Gray Women could see, while the
other two were in utter darkness; and, moreover, at the
instant when the eye was passing from hand to hand, none
of the poor old ladies was able to see a wink. I have heard
of a great many strange things in my day, and have witnessed
not a few, but none, it seems to me, that can compare with
the oddity of these Three Gray Women all peeping through
a single eye.

So thought Perseus, likewise, and was so astonished that
he almost fancied his companion was joking with him, and
that there were no such old women in the world.

[Pg 51]       You will soon find whether I tell the truth or no,        observed
Quicksilver.        Hark! hush! hist! hist! There they come
now!       

Perseus looked earnestly through the dusk of the evening,
and there, sure enough, at no great distance off, he descried
the Three Gray Women. The light being so faint, he could
not well make out what sort of figures they were; only he
discovered that they had long gray hair, and as they came
nearer he saw that two of them had but the empty socket of
an eye in the middle of their foreheads. But in the middle of
the third sister's forehead there was a very large, bright and
piercing eye, which sparkled like a great diamond in a ring;
and so penetrating did it seem to be that Perseus could not
help thinking it must possess the gift of seeing in the darkest
midnight just as perfectly as at noonday. The sight of three
persons' eyes was melted and collected into that single one.

Thus the three old dames got along about as comfortably,
upon the whole, as if they could all see at once. She who
chanced to have the eye in her forehead led the other two by
the hands, peeping sharply about her all the while; insomuch
that Perseus dreaded lest she should see right through the
thick clump of bushes behind which he and Quicksilver had
hidden themselves. My stars! it was positively terrible to
be within reach of so very sharp an eye!

But before they reached the clump of bushes, one of the
Three Gray Women spoke.

       Sister! Sister Scarecrow!        cried she,        you have had the
eye long enough. It is my turn now!       

       Let me keep it a moment longer, Sister Nightmare,       
answered Scarecrow.        I thought I had a glimpse of something
behind that thick bush.       

       Well, and what of that?        retorted Nightmare, peevishly.
       Can't I see into a thick bush as easily as yourself? The[Pg 52]
eye is mine as well as yours; and I know the use of it as well
as you, or maybe a little better. I insist upon taking a peep
immediately!       

But here the third sister, whose name was Shakejoint,
began to complain, and said that it was her turn to have the
eye, and that Scarecrow and Nightmare wanted to keep it all
to themselves. To end the dispute, old Dame Scarecrow took
the eye out of her forehead and held it forth in her hand.

       Take it, one of you,        cried she,        and quit this foolish
quarreling. For my part, I shall be glad of a little thick
darkness. Take it quickly, however, or I must clap it into
my own head again!       

Accordingly, both Nightmare and Shakejoint put out their
hands, groping eagerly to snatch the eye out of the hand of
Scarecrow. But being both alike blind, they could not easily
find where Scarecrow's hand was; and Scarecrow, being now
just as much in the dark as Shakejoint and Nightmare, could
not at once meet either of their hands in order to put the eye
into it. Thus (as you will see with half an eye, my wise little
auditors) these good old dames had fallen into a strange
perplexity. For, though the eye shone and glistened like
a star as Scarecrow held it out, yet the Gray Women caught
not the least glimpse of its light and were all three in utter
darkness from too impatient a desire to see.

Quicksilver was so much tickled at beholding Shakejoint
and Nightmare both groping for the eye, and each finding
fault with Scarecrow and one another, that he could scarcely
help laughing aloud.

       Now is your time!        he whispered to Perseus.        Quick,
quick! before they can clap the eye into either of their heads.
Rush out upon the old ladies and snatch it from Scarecrow's
hand!       

In an instant, while the Three Gray Women were still[Pg 53]
scolding each other, Perseus leaped from behind the clump
of bushes and made himself master of the prize. The marvelous
eye, as he held it in his hand, shone very brightly, and
seemed to look up into his face with a knowing air, and an
expression as if it would have winked had it been provided
with a pair of eyelids for that purpose. But the Gray Women
knew nothing of what had happened, and each supposing that
one of her sisters was in possession of the eye, they began their
quarrel anew. At last, as Perseus did not wish to put these
respectable dames to greater inconvenience than was really
necessary, he thought it right to explain the matter.

       My good ladies,        said he,        pray do not be angry with one
another. If anybody is in fault, it is myself; for I have the
honor to hold your very brilliant and excellent eye in my own
hand!       

       You! you have our eye! And who are you?        screamed
the Three Gray Women all in a breath; for they were terribly
frightened, of course, at hearing a strange voice and discovering
that their eyesight had got into the hands of they could not
guess whom.        Oh, what shall we do, sisters? what shall we
do? We are all in the dark! Give us our eye! Give us our
one precious, solitary eye! You have two of your own!
Give us our eye!       

       Tell them,        whispered Quicksilver to Perseus,        that
they shall have back the eye as soon as they direct you where
to find the Nymphs who have the flying slippers, the magic
wallet and the helmet of darkness.       

       My dear, good, admirable old ladies,        said Perseus,
addressing the Gray Women,        there is no occasion for putting
yourselves into such a fright. I am by no means a bad young
man. You shall have back your eye, safe and sound, and as
bright as ever, the moment you tell me where to find the
Nymphs.       

[Pg 54]       The Nymphs! Goodness me! sisters, what Nymphs
does he mean?        screamed Scarecrow.        There are a great
many Nymphs, people say; some that go a hunting in the
woods, and some that live inside of trees, and some that have a
comfortable home in fountains of water. We know nothing
at all about them. We are three unfortunate old souls that
go wandering about in the dusk and never had but one eye
amongst us, and that one you have stolen away. Oh, give it
back, good stranger!       whoever you are, give it back!       

All this while the Three Gray Women were groping with
their outstretched hands and trying their utmost to get hold
of Perseus. But he took good care to keep out of their reach.

       My respectable dames,        said he       for his mother had
taught him always to use the greatest civility-.       I hold your
eye fast in my hand and shall keep it safely for you until you
please to tell me where to find these Nymphs. The Nymphs,
I mean, who keep the enchanted wallet, the flying slippers and
the what is it?       the helmet of invisibility.       

       Mercy on us, sisters! what is the young man talking
about?        exclaimed Scarecrow, Nightmare and Shakejoint,
one to another, with great appearance of astonishment.        A
pair of flying slippers, quoth he! His heels would quickly
fly higher than his head if he was silly enough to put them on.
And a helmet of invisibility! How could a helmet make him
invisible, unless it were big enough for him to hide under it?
And an enchanted wallet! What sort of a contrivance may
that be, I wonder? No, no, good stranger! we can tell you
nothing of these marvelous things. You have two eyes of
your own and we have but a single one amongst us three.
You can find out such wonders better than three blind old
creatures like us.       

Perseus, hearing them talk in this way, began really to
think that the Gray Women knew nothing of the matter;[Pg 55]
and, as it grieved him to put them to so much trouble, he was
just on the point of restoring their eye and asking pardon for
his rudeness in snatching it away. But Quicksilver caught
his hand.

       Don't let them make a fool of you!        said he.        These
Three Gray Women are the only persons in the world that
can tell you where to find the Nymphs, and unless you get
that information you will never succeed in cutting off the head
of Medusa with the snaky locks. Keep fast hold on the eye
and all will go well.       

As it turned out, Quicksilver was in the right. There are
but few things that people prize so much as they do their
eyesight; and the Gray Women valued their single eye as
highly as if it had been half a dozen, which was the number
they ought to have had. Finding that there was no other
way of recovering it, they at last told Perseus what he wanted
to know. No sooner had they done so than he immediately
and with the utmost respect clapped the eye into the vacant
socket in one of their foreheads, thanked them for their kindness
and bade them farewell. Before the young man was out
of hearing, however, they had got into a new dispute, because
he happened to have given the eye to Scarecrow, who had
already taken her turn of it when their trouble with Perseus
commenced.

It is greatly to be feared that the Three Gray Women
were very much in the habit of disturbing their mutual harmony
by bickerings of this sort, which was the more pity, as
they could not conveniently do without one another and were
evidently intended to be inseparable companions. As a
general rule, I would advise all people, whether sisters or
brothers, old or young, who chance to have but one eye amongst
them, to cultivate forbearance and not all insist upon peeping
through it at once.

[Pg 56]Quicksilver and Perseus, in the meantime, were making
the best of their way in quest of the Nymphs. The old dames
had given them such particular directions that they were
not long in finding them out. They proved to be very different
persons from Nightmare, Shakejoint and Scarecrow;
for, instead of being old, they were young and beautiful;
and instead of one eye amongst the sisterhood, each Nymph
had two exceedingly bright eyes of her own, with which she
looked very kindly at Perseus. They seemed to be acquainted
with Quicksilver, and when he told them the adventure which
Perseus had undertaken, they made no difficulty about giving
him the valuable articles that were in their custody. In the
first place, they brought out what appeared to be a small
purse, made of deer skin and curiously embroidered, and bade
him be sure and keep it safe. This was the magic wallet.
The Nymphs next produced a pair of shoes or slippers or
sandals, with a nice little pair of wings at the heel of each.

       Put them on, Perseus,        said Quicksilver.        You will
find yourself as light-heeled as you can desire for the remainder
of our journey.       

So Perseus proceeded to put one of the slippers on, while
he laid the other on the ground by his side. Unexpectedly,
however, this other slipper spread its wings, fluttered up off
the ground and would probably have flown away if Quicksilver
had not made a leap and luckily caught it in the air.

       Be more careful,        said he as he gave it back to Perseus.
       It would frighten the birds up aloft if they should see a
flying slipper amongst them.       

When Perseus had got on both of these wonderful slippers,
he was altogether too buoyant to tread on earth. Making a
step or two, lo and behold! upward he popped into the air
high above the heads of Quicksilver and the Nymphs, and
found it very difficult to clamber down again. Winged slippers[Pg 57]
and all such high-flying contrivances are seldom quite easy to
manage until one grows a little accustomed to them. Quicksilver
laughed at his companion's involuntary activity and
told him that he must not be in so desperate a hurry, but must
wait for the invisible helmet.

The good-natured Nymphs had the helmet, with its dark
tuft of waving plumes, all in readiness to put upon his head.
And now there happened about as wonderful an incident as
anything that I have yet told you. The instant before the
helmet was put on, there stood Perseus, a beautiful young
man, with golden ringlets and rosy cheeks, the crooked sword
by his side and the brightly polished shield upon his arm       a
figure that seemed all made up of courage, sprightliness and
glorious light. But when the helmet had descended over his
white brow, there was no longer any Perseus to be seen!
Nothing but empty air! Even the helmet that covered him
with its invisibility had vanished!

       Where are you, Perseus?        asked Quicksilver.

       Why, here, to be sure!        answered Perseus very quietly,
although, his voice seemed to come out of the transparent
atmosphere.        Just where I was a moment ago. Don't you
see me?       

       No, indeed!        answered his friend.        You are hidden
under the helmet. But if I cannot see you, neither can the
Gorgons. Follow me, therefore, and we will try your dexterity
in using the winged slippers.       

With these words, Quicksilver's cap spread its wings, as if
his head were about to fly away from his shoulders; but his
whole figure rose lightly into the air and Perseus followed.
By the time they had ascended a few hundred feet the young
man began to feel what a delightful thing it was to leave the
dull earth so far beneath him and to be able to flit about like
a bird.

[Pg 58]It was now deep night. Perseus looked upward and saw
the round, bright, silvery moon and thought that he should
desire nothing better than to soar up thither and spend his
life there. Then he looked downward again and saw the
earth, with its seas and lakes, and the silver course of its rivers,
and its snowy mountain peaks, and the breath of its fields,
and the dark cluster of its woods, and its cities of white marble;
and with the moonshine sleeping over the whole scene, it was
as beautiful as the moon or any star could be. And among
other objects he saw the island of Seriphus, where his dear
mother was. Sometimes he and Quicksilver approached a
cloud that at a distance looked as if it were made of fleecy
silver, although when they plunged into it they found themselves
chilled and moistened with gray mist. So swift was
their flight, however, that in an instant they emerged from
the cloud into the moonlight again. Once a high-soaring
eagle flew right against the invisible Perseus. The bravest
sights were the meteors that gleamed suddenly out as if a
bonfire had been kindled in the sky and made the moonshine
pale for as much as a hundred miles around them.

As the two companions flew onward, Perseus fancied that
he could hear the rustle of a garment close by his side; and
it was on the side opposite to the one where he beheld Quicksilver,
yet only Quicksilver was visible.

       Whose garment is this,        inquired Perseus,        that keeps
rustling close beside me in the breeze?       

       Oh, it is my sister's!        answered Quicksilver.        She
is coming along with us, as I told you she would. We could
do nothing without the help of my sister. You have no idea
how wise she is. She has such eyes, too! Why, she can see
you at this moment just as distinctly as if you were not
invisible, and I'll venture to say she will be the first to discover
the Gorgons.       

[Pg 59]By this time, in their swift voyage through the air, they
had come within sight of the great ocean and were soon flying
over it. Far beneath them the waves tossed themselves
tumultuously in mid-sea, or rolled a white surf line upon the
long beaches, or foamed against the rocky cliffs, with a roar
that was thunderous in the lower world, although it became a
gentle murmur, like the voice of a baby half asleep, before it
reached the ears of Perseus. Just then a voice spoke in the
air close by him. It seemed to be a woman's voice and was
melodious, though not exactly what might be called sweet,
but grave and mild.

       Perseus,        said the voice,        there are the Gorgons.       

       Where?        exclaimed Perseus.        I cannot see them.       

       On the shore of that island beneath you,        replied the voice.
       A pebble dropped from your hand would strike in the midst
of them.       

       I told you she would be the first to discover them,        said
Quicksilver to Perseus.        And there they are!       

Straight downward, two or three thousand feet below him,
Perseus perceived a small island, with the sea breaking into
white foam all around its rocky shore, except on one side,
where there was a beach of snowy sand. He descended
toward it, and looking earnestly at a cluster or heap of brightness
at the foot of a precipice of black rocks, behold, there
were the terrible Gorgons! They lay fast asleep, soothed by
the thunder of the sea; for it required a tumult that would
have deafened everybody else to lull such fierce creatures
into slumber. The moonlight glistened on their steely scales
and on their golden wings, which drooped idly over the sand.
Their brazen claws, horrible to look at, were thrust out and
clutched the wave-beaten fragments of rock, while the sleeping
Gorgons dreamed of tearing some poor mortal all to pieces.
The snakes that served them instead of hair seemed likewise[Pg 60]
to be asleep, although now and then one would writhe and lift
its head and thrust out its forked tongue, emitting a drowsy
hiss, and then let itself subside among its sister snakes.

The Gorgons were more like an awful, gigantic kind of insect       immense,
golden-winged beetles or dragonflies or things of
that sort       at once ugly and beautiful       than like anything
else; only that they were a thousand and a million times as
big. And with all this there was something partly human
about them, too. Luckily for Perseus, their faces were completely
hidden from him by the posture in which they lay,
for had he but looked one instant at them, he would have
fallen heavily out of the air, an image of senseless stone.

       Now,        whispered Quicksilver as he hovered by the side
of Perseus-.       now is your time to do the deed! Be quick,
for if one of the Gorgons should awake, you are too late!       

       Which shall I strike at?        asked Perseus, drawing his
sword and descending a little lower.        They all three look
alike. All three have snaky locks. Which of the three is
Medusa?       

It must be understood that Medusa was the only one of
these dragon monsters whose head Perseus could possibly
cut off. As for the other two, let him have the sharpest
sword that ever was forged, and he might have hacked away
by the hour together without doing them the least harm.

       Be cautious,        said the calm voice which had before spoken
to him.        One of the Gorgons is stirring in her sleep and is
just about to turn over. That is Medusa. Do not look at
her! The sight would turn you to stone! Look at the reflection
of her face and figure in the bright mirror of your shield.       

Perseus now understood Quicksilver's motive for so earnestly
exhorting him to polish his shield. In its surface he could
safely look at the reflection of the Gorgon's face. And there
it was       that terrible countenance       mirrored in the brightness[Pg 61]
of the shield, with the moonlight falling over it and displaying
all its horror. The snakes, whose venomous natures could
not altogether sleep, kept twisting themselves over the forehead.
It was the fiercest and most horrible face that ever
was seen or imagined, and yet with a strange, fearful and
savage kind of beauty in it. The eyes were closed and the
Gorgon was still in a deep slumber; but there was an unquiet
expression disturbing her features, as if the monster was
troubled with an ugly dream. She gnashed her white tusks
and dug into the sand with her brazen claws.

The snakes, too, seemed to feel Medusa's dream and to be
made more restless by it. They twined themselves into
tumultuous knots, writhed fiercely and uplifted a hundred
hissing heads without opening their eyes.

       Now, now!        whispered Quicksilver, who was growing
impatient.        Make a dash at the monster!       

       But be calm,        said the grave, melodious voice at the young
man's side.        Look in your shield as you fly downward, and
take care that you do not miss your first stroke.       

Perseus flew cautiously downward, still keeping his eyes on
Medusa's face, as reflected in his shield. The nearer he came,
the more terrible did the snaky visage and metallic body of
the monster grow. At last, when he found himself hovering
over her within arm's length, Perseus uplifted his sword,
while at the same instant each separate snake upon the Gorgon's
head stretched threateningly upward, and Medusa
unclosed her eyes. But she awoke too late. The sword was
sharp, the stroke fell like a lightning flash, and the head of the
wicked Medusa tumbled from her body!

       Admirably done!        cried Quicksilver.        Make haste and
clap the head into your magic wallet.       

To the astonishment of Perseus, the small, embroidered
wallet which he had hung about his neck and which had[Pg 62]
hitherto been no bigger than a purse, grew all at once large
enough to contain Medusa's head. As quick as thought, he
snatched it up, with the snakes still writhing upon it, and
thrust it in.

       Your task is done,        said the calm voice.        Now fly, for
the other Gorgons will do their utmost to take vengeance for
Medusa's death.       

It was, indeed, necessary to take flight, for Perseus had not
done the deed so quietly but that the clash of his sword and
the hissing of the snakes and the thump of Medusa's head as
it tumbled upon the sea-beaten sand awoke the other two
monsters. There they sat for an instant, sleepily rubbing
their eyes with their brazen fingers, while all the snakes on
their heads reared themselves on end with surprise and with
venomous malice against they knew not what. But when the
Gorgons saw the scaly carcass of Medusa, headless, and her
golden wings all ruffled and half spread out on the sand,
it was really awful to hear what yells and screeches they set
up. And then the snakes! They sent forth a hundredfold
hiss with one consent, and Medusa's snakes answered them out
of the magic wallet.

No sooner were the Gorgons broad awake than they hurtled
upward into the air, brandishing their brass talons, gnashing
their horrible tusks and flapping their huge wings so wildly
that some of the golden feathers were shaken out and floated
down upon the shore. And there, perhaps, those very feathers
lie scattered till this day. Up rose the Gorgons, as I tell you,
staring horribly about, in hopes of turning somebody to stone.
Had Perseus looked them in the face or had he fallen into their
clutches, his poor mother would never have kissed her boy
again! But he took good care to turn his eyes another way;
and as he wore the helmet of invisibility, the Gorgons knew not
in what direction to follow him; nor did he fail to make the[Pg 63]
best use of the winged slippers by soaring upward a perpendicular
mile or so. At that height, when the screams of those
abominable creatures sounded faintly beneath him, he made
a straight course for the island of Seriphus, in order to carry
Medusa's head to King Polydectes.

I have no time to tell you of several marvelous things that
befell Perseus on his way homeward, such as his killing a
hideous sea monster just as it was on the point of devouring a
beautiful maiden, nor how he changed an enormous giant into
a mountain of stone merely by showing him the head of the
Gorgon. If you doubt this latter story, you may make a
voyage to Africa some day or other and see the very mountain,
which is still known by the ancient giant's name.

Finally, our brave Perseus arrived at the island where he
expected to see his dear mother. But during his absence,
the wicked king had treated Dana       so very ill that she was
compelled to make her escape, and had taken refuge in a
temple, where some good old priests were extremely kind to
her. These praiseworthy priests and the kind-hearted fisherman,
who had first shown hospitality to Dana       and little
Perseus when he found them afloat in the chest, seem to have
been the only persons on the island who cared about doing
right. All the rest of the people, as well as King Polydectes
himself, were remarkably ill behaved and deserved no better
destiny than that which was now to happen.

Not finding his mother at home, Perseus went straight to
the palace and was immediately ushered into the presence of
the king. Polydectes was by no means rejoiced to see him,
for he had felt almost certain, in his own evil mind, that the
Gorgons would have torn the poor young man to pieces and
have eaten him up out of the way. However, seeing him
safely returned, he put the best face he could upon the matter
and asked Perseus how he had succeeded.

[Pg 64]       Have you performed your promise?        inquired he.        Have
you brought me the head of Medusa with the snaky locks?
If not, young man, it will cost you dear; for I must have a
bridal present for the beautiful Princess Hippodamia and there
is nothing else that she would admire so much.       

       Yes, please your Majesty,        answered Perseus, in a quiet
way, as if it were no very wonderful deed for such a young
man as he to perform.        I have brought you the Gorgon's
head, snaky locks and all!       

       Indeed! Pray, let me see it,        quoth King Polydectes.
       It must be a very curious spectacle if all that travelers tell
it be true!       

       Your Majesty is in the right,        replied Perseus.        It is
really an object that will be pretty certain to fix the regards
of all who look at it. And if your Majesty think fit, I would
suggest that a holiday be proclaimed and that all your
Majesty's subjects be summoned to behold this wonderful
curiosity. Few of them, I imagine, have seen a Gorgon's
head before and perhaps never may again!       

The king well knew that his subjects were an idle set of
reprobates and very fond of sight-seeing, as idle persons usually
are. So he took the young man's advice and sent out heralds
and messengers in all directions to blow the trumpet at the
street corners and in the market places and wherever two
roads met, and summon everybody to court. Thither,
accordingly, came a great multitude of good-for-nothing
vagabonds, all of whom, out of pure love of mischief, would
have been glad if Perseus had met with some ill-hap in his
encounter with the Gorgons. If there were any better people
in the island (as I really hope there may have been, although
the story tells nothing about any such), they stayed quietly
at home, minding their business and taking care of their
little children. Most of the inhabitants, at all events, ran[Pg 65]
as fast as they could to the palace and shoved and pushed and
elbowed one another in their eagerness to get near a balcony
on which Perseus showed himself, holding the embroidered
wallet in his hand.

On a platform within full view of the balcony sat the
mighty King Polydectes, amid his evil counselors, and with
his flattering courtiers in a semi-circle round about him.
Monarch, counselors, courtiers and subjects all gazed eagerly
toward Perseus.

       Show us the head! Show us the head!        shouted the people;
and there was a fierceness in their cry as if they would tear
Perseus to pieces unless he should satisfy them with what he
had to show.        Show us the head of Medusa with the snaky
locks!       

A feeling of sorrow and pity came over the youthful Perseus.

       O King Polydectes,        cried he,        and ye many people,
I am very loath to show you the Gorgon's head!       

       Ah, the villain and coward!        yelled the people more
fiercely than before.        He is making game of us! He has no
Gorgon's head! Show us the head if you have it, or we will
take your own head for a football!       

The evil counselors whispered bad advice in the king's
ear; the courtiers murmured, with one consent, that Perseus
had shown disrespect to their royal lord and master; and the
great King Polydectes himself waved his hand and ordered
him, with the stern, deep voice of authority, on his peril, to
produce the head.

       Show me the Gorgon's head or I will cut off your own!       

And Perseus sighed.

       This instant,        repeated Polydectes,        or you die!       

       Behold it then!        cried Perseus in a voice like the blast of a
trumpet.

And suddenly holding up the head, not an eyelid had time[Pg 66]
to wink before the wicked King Polydectes, his evil counselors
and all his fierce subjects were no longer anything but the
mere images of a monarch and his people. They were all
fixed forever in the look and attitude of that moment! At
the first glimpse of the terrible head of Medusa, they whitened
into marble! And Perseus thrust the head back into his
wallet and went to tell his dear mother that she need no longer
be afraid of the wicked King Polydectes.

THE GOLDEN FLEECE
[Pg 67]

When Jason, the son of the dethroned King of Iolchos, was
a little boy, he was sent away from his parents and placed
under the queerest schoolmaster that ever you heard of. This
learned person was one of the people, or quadrupeds, called
Centaurs. He lived in a cavern, and had the body and legs
of a white horse, with the head and shoulders of a man. His
name was Chiron; and in spite of his odd appearance, he was
a very excellent teacher and had several scholars who afterward
did him credit by making a great figure in the world.
The famous Hercules was one, and so was Achilles, and
Philoctetes likewise, and        sculapius, who acquired immense
repute as a doctor. The good Chiron taught his pupils how
to play upon the harp, and how to cure diseases, and how to
use the sword and shield, together with various other branches
of education in which the lads of those days used to be instructed
instead of writing and arithmetic.

I have sometimes suspected that Master Chiron was not
really very different from other people, but that, being a
kind-hearted and merry old fellow, he was in the habit of
making believe that he was a horse, and scrambling about
the schoolroom on all fours and letting the little boys ride
upon his back. And so, when his scholars had grown up and
grown old and were trotting their grandchildren on their
knees, they told them about the sports of their school-days;
and these young folks took the idea that their grandfathers
had been taught their letters by a Centaur, half man and half
horse. Little children, not quite understanding what is said
to them, often get such absurd notions into their heads, you
know.

[Pg 68]Be that as it may, it has always been told for a fact (and
always will be told, as long as the world lasts) that Chiron,
with the head of a schoolmaster, had the body and legs of a
horse. Just imagine the grave old gentleman clattering and
stamping into the schoolroom on his four hoofs, perhaps
treading on some little fellow's toes, flourishing his switch
tail instead of a rod and now and then trotting out of doors
to eat a mouthful of grass! I wonder what the blacksmith
charged him for a set of iron shoes.

So Jason dwelt in the cave, with this four-footed Chiron
from the time that he was an infant only a few months old,
until he had grown to the full height of a man. He became a
very good harper, I suppose, and skilful in the use of weapons
and tolerably acquainted with herbs and other doctor's stuff,
and above all, an admirable horseman; for, in teaching young
people to ride, the good Chiron must have been without a
rival among schoolmasters. At length, being now a tall and
athletic youth, Jason resolved to seek his fortune in the
world without asking Chiron's advice or telling him anything
about the matter. This was very unwise, to be sure; and I
hope none of you, my little hearers, will ever follow Jason's
example. But, you are to understand, he had heard how that
he himself was a prince royal, and how his father, King        son,
had been deprived of the kingdom of Iolchos by a certain
Pelias, who would also have killed Jason had he not been
hidden in the Centaur's cave. And being come to the strength
of a man, Jason determined to set all this business to rights
and to punish the wicked Pelias for wronging his dear father,
and to cast him down from the throne and seat himself there
instead.

With this intention he took a spear in each hand and threw
a leopard's skin over his shoulders to keep off the rain, and set
forth on his travels, with his long yellow ringlets waving in[Pg 69]
the wind. The part of his dress on which he most prided
himself was a pair of sandals that had been his father's.
They were handsomely embroidered and were tied upon his
feet with strings of gold. But his whole attire was such as
people did not very often see; and as he passed along, the
women and children ran to the doors and windows, wondering
whither this beautiful youth was journeying, with his leopard's
skin and his golden-tied sandals, and what heroic deeds he
meant to perform, with a spear in his right hand and another
in his left.

I know not how far Jason had traveled when he came to
a turbulent river, which rushed right across his pathway
with specks of white foam along its black eddies, hurrying
tumultuously onward and roaring angrily as it went. Though
not a very broad river in the dry seasons of the year, it was
now swollen by heavy rains and by the melting of the snow on
the sides of Mount Olympus; and it thundered so loudly and
looked so wild and dangerous that Jason, bold as he was,
thought it prudent to pause upon the brink. The bed of
the stream seemed to be strewn with sharp and rugged rocks,
some of which thrust themselves above the water. By and
by an uprooted tree, with shattered branches, came drifting
along the current and got entangled among the rocks. Now
and then a drowned sheep and once the carcass of a cow
floated past.

In short, the swollen river had already done a great deal of
mischief. It was evidently too deep for Jason to wade and
too boisterous for him to swim; he could see no bridge, and as
for a boat, had there been any, the rocks would have broken
it to pieces in an instant.

       See the poor lad,        said a cracked voice close to his side.
       He must have had but a poor education, since he does not
know how to cross a little stream like this. Or is he afraid[Pg 70]
of wetting his fine golden-stringed sandals? It is a pity his
four-footed schoolmaster is not here to carry him safely
across on his back!       

Jason looked round greatly surprised, for he did not know
that anybody was near. But beside him stood an old woman,
with a ragged mantle over her head, leaning on a staff, the
top of which was carved into the shape of a cuckoo. She
looked very aged and wrinkled and infirm; and yet her
eyes, which were as brown as those of an ox, were so extremely
large and beautiful that when they were fixed on Jason's
eyes he could see nothing else but them. The old woman had
a pomegranate in her hand, although the fruit was then quite
out of season.

       Whither are you going, Jason?        she now asked.

She seemed to know his name, you will observe; and,
indeed, those great brown eyes looked as if they had a knowledge
of everything, whether past or to come. While Jason
was gazing at her a peacock strutted forward and took his
stand at the old woman's side.

       I am going to Iolchos,        answered the young man,        to
bid the wicked King Pelias come down from my father's
throne and let me reign in his stead.       

       Ah, well, then,        said the old woman, still with the same
cracked voice,        if that is all your business, you need not be
in a very great hurry. Just take me on your back, there's
a good youth, and carry me across the river. I and my
peacock have something to do on the other side, as well as
yourself.       

       Good mother,        replied Jason,        your business can hardly
be so important as the pulling down a king from his throne.
Besides, as you may see for yourself, the river is very boisterous;
and if I should chance to stumble, it would sweep both
of us away more easily than it has carried off yonder uprooted[Pg 71]
tree. I would gladly help you if I could, but I doubt whether
I am strong enough to carry you across.       

       Then,        said she very scornfully,        neither are you strong
enough to pull King Pelias off his throne. And, Jason, unless
you will help an old woman at her need, you ought not to be a
king. What are kings made for, save to succor the feeble
and distressed? But do as you please. Either take me on
your back, or with my poor old limbs I shall try my best to
struggle across the stream.       

Saying this, the old woman poked with her staff in the river
as if to find the safest place in its rocky bed where she might
make the first step. But Jason by this time had grown
ashamed of his reluctance to help her. He felt that he could
never forgive himself if this poor feeble creature should come
to any harm in attempting to wrestle against the headlong
current. The good Chiron, whether half horse or no, had
taught him that the noblest use of his strength was to assist
the weak; and also that he must treat every young woman
as if she were his sister and every old one like a mother.
Remembering these maxims, the vigorous and beautiful young
man knelt down and requested the good dame to mount upon
his back.

       The passage seems to me not very safe,        he remarked,
       but as your business is so urgent I will try to carry you
across. If the river sweeps you away it shall take me, too.       

       That, no doubt, will be a great comfort to both of us,       
quoth the old woman.        But never fear! We shall get safely
across.       

So she threw her arms around Jason's neck; and, lifting
her from the ground, he stepped boldly into the raging and
foamy current, and began to stagger away from the shore.
As for the peacock, it alighted on the old dame's shoulder.
Jason's two spears, one in each hand, kept him from stumbling[Pg 72]
and enabled him to feel his way among the hidden rocks;
although every instant he expected that his companion and
himself would go down the stream together with the driftwood
of shattered trees and the carcasses of the sheep and cow.
Down came the cold, snowy torrent from the steep side of
Olympus, raging and thundering as if it had a real spite against
Jason or, at all events, were determined to snatch off his
living burden from his shoulders. When he was half way
across the uprooted tree (which I have already told you about)
broke loose from among the rocks and bore down upon him
with all its splintered branches sticking out like the hundred
arms of the giant Briareus. It rushed past, however, without
touching him. But the next moment his foot was caught in a
crevice between two rocks and stuck there so fast that in the
effort to get free he lost one of his golden-stringed sandals.

At this accident Jason could not help uttering a cry of
vexation.

       What is the matter, Jason?        asked the old woman.

       Matter enough,        said the young man.        I have lost a
sandal here among the rocks. And what sort of a figure shall
I cut at the court of King Pelias with a golden-stringed sandal
on one foot and the other foot bare!       

       Do not take it to heart,        answered his companion cheerily.
       You never met with better fortune than in losing that
sandal. It satisfies me that you are the very person whom
the Speaking Oak has been talking about.       

There was no time just then to inquire what the Speaking
Oak had said. But the briskness of her tone encouraged the
young man; and, besides, he had never in his life felt so
vigorous and mighty as since taking this old woman on his
back. Instead of being exhausted he gathered strength as
he went on; and, struggling up against the torrent, he at
last gained the opposite shore, clambered up the bank and[Pg 73]
set down the old dame and her peacock safely on the grass.
As soon as this was done, however, he could not help looking
rather despondently at his bare foot, with only a remnant of
the golden string of the sandal clinging round his ankle.

       You will get a handsomer pair of sandals by and by,       
said the old woman, with a kindly look out of her beautiful
brown eyes.        Only let King Pelias get a glimpse of that
bare foot and you shall see him turn as pale as ashes, I promise
you. There is your path. Go along, my good Jason, and my
blessing go with you. And when you sit on your throne
remember the old woman whom you helped over the river.       

With these words she hobbled away, giving him a smile
over her shoulder as she departed. Whether the light of her
beautiful brown eyes threw a glory round about her, or whatever
the cause might be, Jason fancied that there was something
very noble and majestic in her figure after all, and that,
though her gait seemed to be a rheumatic hobble, yet she
moved with as much grace and dignity as any queen on earth.
Her peacock, which had now fluttered down from her shoulder,
strutted behind her in prodigious pomp and spread out its
magnificent tail on purpose for Jason to admire it.

When the old dame and her peacock were out of sight
Jason set forward on his journey. After traveling a pretty
long distance he came to a town situated at the foot of a
mountain and not a great way from the shore of the sea. On
the outside of the town there was an immense crowd of people,
not only men and women, but children, too, all in their best
clothes and evidently enjoying a holiday. The crowd was
thickest toward the seashore, and in that direction, over the
people's heads, Jason saw a wreath of smoke curling upward
to the blue sky. He inquired of one of the multitude what
town it was near by and why so many persons were here
assembled together.

[Pg 74]       This is the kingdom of Iolchos,        answered the man,        and
we are the subjects of King Pelias. Our monarch has summoned
us together, that we may see him sacrifice a black bull
to Neptune, who, they say, is his majesty's father. Yonder
is the king, where you see the smoke going up from the altar.       

While the man spoke he eyed Jason with great curiosity;
for his garb was quite unlike that of the Iolchians, and it
looked very odd to see a youth with a leopard's skin over his
shoulders and each hand grasping a spear. Jason perceived,
too, that the man stared particularly at his feet, one of which,
you remember, was bare, while the other was decorated with
his father's golden-stringed sandal.

       Look at him! only look at him!        said the man to his next
neighbor.        Do you see? He wears but one sandal!       

Upon this, first one person and then another began to stare
at Jason, and everybody seemed to be greatly struck with
something in his aspect; though they turned their eyes much
oftener toward his feet than to any other part of his figure.
Besides, he could hear them whispering to one another.

       One sandal! One sandal!        they kept saying.        The
man with one sandal! Here he is at last! Whence has he
come? What does he mean to do? What will the king say
to the one-sandaled man?       

Poor Jason was greatly abashed and made up his mind that
the people of Iolchos were exceedingly ill-bred to take such
public notice of an accidental deficiency in his dress. Meanwhile,
whether it were that they hustled him forward or that
Jason of his own accord thrust a passage through the crowd,
it so happened that he soon found himself close to the smoking
altar, where King Pelias was sacrificing the black bull. The
murmur and hum of the multitude, in their surprise at the
spectacle of Jason with his one bare foot, grew so loud that it
disturbed the ceremonies; and the king, holding the great[Pg 75]
knife with which he was just going to cut the bull's throat,
turned angrily about and fixed his eyes on Jason. The people
had now withdrawn from around him, so that the youth
stood in an open space, near the smoking altar, front to front
with the angry King Pelias.

       Who are you?        cried the king, with a terrible frown.
       And how dare you make this disturbance, while I am sacrificing
a black bull to my father Neptune?       

       It is no fault of mine,        answered Jason.        Your majesty
must blame the rudeness of your subjects, who have raised
all this tumult because one of my feet happens to be bare.       

When Jason said this the king gave a quick, startled glance
at his feet.

       Ha!        muttered he,        here is the one-sandaled fellow, sure
enough! What can I do with him?       

And he clutched more closely the great knife in his hand,
as if he were half a mind to slay Jason instead of the black
bull. The people round about caught up the king's words,
indistinctly as they were uttered; and first there was a murmur
among them and then a loud shout.

       The one-sandaled man has come! The prophecy must be
fulfilled!       

For you are to know that many years before King Pelias
had been told by the Speaking Oak of Dodona that a man
with one sandal should cast him down from his throne.
On this account he had given strict orders that nobody should
ever come into his presence unless both sandals were securely
tied upon his feet; and he kept an officer in his palace whose
sole business it was to examine people's sandals and to supply
them with a new pair at the expense of the royal treasury as
soon as the old ones began to wear out. In the whole course
of the king's reign he had never been thrown into such a
fright and agitation as by the spectacle of poor Jason's bare[Pg 76]
foot. But as he was naturally a bold and hard-hearted man,
he soon took courage and began to consider in what way he
might rid himself of this terrible one-sandaled stranger.

       My good young man,        said King Pelias, taking the
softest tone imaginable in order to throw Jason off his guard,
       you are excessively welcome to my kingdom. Judging
by your dress, you must have traveled a long distance, for
it is not the fashion to wear leopard-skins in this part of the
world. Pray, what may I call your name, and where did you
receive your education?       

       My name is Jason,        answered the young stranger.        Ever
since my infancy I have dwelt in the cave of Chiron the Centaur.
He was my instructor, and taught me music and horsemanship
and how to cure wounds, and likewise how to inflict
wounds with my weapons!       

       I have heard of Chiron the schoolmaster,        replied King
Pelias,        and how that there is an immense deal of learning
and wisdom in his head, although it happens to be set on a
horse's body. It gives me great delight to see one of his
scholars at my court. But to test how much you have profited
under so excellent a teacher, will you allow me to ask you a
single question?       

       I do not pretend to be very wise,        said Jason;        but ask
me what you please and I will answer to the best of my ability.       

Now King Pelias meant cunningly to entrap the young man
and to make him say something that should be the cause of
mischief and destruction to himself. So with a crafty and
evil smile upon his face, he spoke as follows:

       What would you do, brave Jason,        asked he,        if there
were a man in the world by whom, as you had reason to believe,
you were doomed to be ruined and slain       what would you do,
I say, if that man stood before you and in your power?       

[Pg 77]When Jason saw the malice and wickedness which King
Pelias could not prevent from gleaming out of his eyes, he
probably guessed that the king had discovered what he came
for, and that he intended to turn his own words against himself.
Still, he scorned to tell a falsehood. Like an upright
and honorable prince, as he was, he determined to speak out
the real truth. Since the king had chosen to ask him the
question and since Jason had promised him an answer, there
was no right way save to tell him precisely what would be
the most prudent thing to do if he had his worst enemy in his
power.

Therefore, after a moment's consideration, he spoke up
with a firm and manly voice:

       I would send such a man,        said he,        in quest of the
Golden Fleece!       

This enterprise, you will understand, was, of all others, the
most difficult and dangerous in the world. In the first place,
it would be necessary to make a long voyage through unknown
seas. There was hardly a hope or a possibility that any young
man who should undertake this voyage would either succeed
in obtaining the Golden Fleece or would survive to return
home and tell of the perils he had run. The eyes of King
Pelias sparkled with joy, therefore, when he heard Jason's
reply.

       Well said, wise man with the one sandal!        cried he.        Go,
then, and at the peril of your life bring me back the Golden
Fleece!       

       I go,        answered Jason composedly.        If I fail, you need
not fear that I will ever come back to trouble you again.
But if I return to Iolchos with the prize, then, King Pelias,
you must hasten down from your lofty throne and give me
your crown and scepter.       

       That I will,        said the king, with a sneer.        Meantime
I will keep them very safely for you.       

[Pg 78]The first thing that Jason thought of doing after he left
the king's presence was to go to Dodona and inquire of the
Talking Oak what course it was best to pursue. This wonderful
tree stood in the center of an ancient wood. Its stately
trunk rose up a hundred feet into the air and threw a broad
and dense shadow over more than an acre of ground. Standing
beneath it, Jason looked up among the knotted branches and
green leaves and into the mysterious heart of the old tree, and
spoke aloud, as if he were addressing some person who was
hidden in the depths of the foliage.

       What shall I do,        said he,        in order to win the Golden
Fleece?       

At first there was a deep silence, not only within the shadow
of the Talking Oak, but all through the solitary wood. In
a moment or two, however, the leaves of the oak began to stir
and rustle as if a gentle breeze were wandering among them,
although the other trees of the wood were perfectly still.
The sound grew louder and became like the roar of a high
wind. By and by Jason imagined that he could distinguish
words, but very confusedly, because each separate leaf of the
tree seemed to be a tongue and the whole myriad of tongues
were babbling at once. But the noise waxed broader and
deeper until it resembled a tornado sweeping through the oak
and making one great utterance out of the thousand and
thousand of little murmurs which each leafy tongue had caused
by its rustling. And now, though it still had the tone of a
mighty wind roaring among the branches, it was also like a
deep bass voice speaking, as distinctly as a tree could be
expected to speak, the following words:

       Go to Argus, the shipbuilder, and bid him build a galley
with fifty oars.       

Then the voice melted again into the indistinct murmur of
the rustling leaves and died gradually away. When it was[Pg 79]
quite gone Jason felt inclined to doubt whether he had actually
heard the words or whether his fancy had not shaped them out
of the ordinary sound made by a breeze while passing through
the thick foliage of the tree.

But on inquiry among the people of Iolchos, he found that
there was really a man in the city by the name of Argus, who
was a very skilful builder of vessels. This showed some
intelligence in the oak, else how should it have known that
any such person existed? At Jason's request Argus readily
consented to build him a galley so big that it should require
fifty strong men to row it, although no vessel of such a size
and burden had heretofore been seen in the world. So the
head carpenter and all his journeymen and apprentices began
their work; and for a good while afterward there they were
busily employed hewing out the timbers and making a great
clatter with their hammers, until the new ship, which was
called the Argo, seemed to be quite ready for sea. And as the
Talking Oak had already given him such good advice, Jason
thought that it would not be amiss to ask for a little more.
He visited it again, therefore, and standing beside its huge,
rough trunk, inquired what he should do next.

This time there was no such universal quivering of the
leaves throughout the whole tree as there had been before.
But after a while Jason observed that the foliage of a great
branch which stretched above his head had begun to rustle
as if the wind were stirring that one bough, while all the other
boughs of the oak were at rest.

       Cut me off!        said the branch, as soon as it could speak
distinctly;        cut me off! cut me off! and carve me into a figurehead
for your galley.       

Accordingly, Jason took the branch at its word and lopped
it off the tree. A carver in the neighborhood engaged to
make the figurehead. He was a tolerably good workman and[Pg 80]
had already carved several figureheads in what he intended
for feminine shapes, and looking pretty much like those
which we see nowadays stuck up under a vessel's bowsprit,
with great staring eyes that never wink at the dash of the
spray. But (what was very strange) the carver found that
his hand was guided by some unseen power and by a skill
beyond his own, and that his tools shaped out an image which
he had never dreamed of. When the work was finished it
turned out to be the figure of a beautiful woman, with a helmet
on her head, from beneath which the long ringlets fell down
upon her shoulders. On the left arm was a shield and in its
center appeared a lifelike representation of the head of Medusa
with the snaky locks. The right arm was extended as if
pointing onward. The face of this wonderful statue, though
not angry or forbidding, was so grave and majestic that perhaps
you might call it severe; and as for the mouth, it seemed just
ready to unclose its lips and utter words of the deepest wisdom.

Jason was delighted with the oaken image and gave the
carver no rest until it was completed and set up where a
figurehead has always stood, from that time to this, in the
vessel's prow.

       And now,        cried he, as he stood gazing at the calm,
majestic face of the statue,        I must go to the Talking Oak and
inquire what next to do.       

       There is no need of that, Jason,        said a voice which, though
it was far lower, reminded him of the mighty tones of the great
oak.        When you desire good advice you can seek it of me.       

Jason had been looking straight into the face of the image
when these words were spoken. But he could hardly believe
either his ears or his eyes. The truth was, however, that the
oaken lips had moved, and to all appearance, the voice had
proceeded from the statue's mouth. Recovering a little from
his surprise, Jason bethought himself that the image had been[Pg 81]
carved out of the wood of the Talking Oak, and that, therefore,
it was really no great wonder, but, on the contrary, the most
natural thing in the world, that it should possess the faculty
of speech. It should have been very odd indeed if it had not.
But certainly it was a great piece of good fortune that he should
be able to carry so wise a block of wood along with him in his
perilous voyage.

       Tell me, wondrous image,        exclaimed Jason,        since you
inherit the wisdom of the Speaking Oak of Dodona, whose
daughter you are       tell me, where shall I find fifty bold youths
who will take each of them an oar of my galley? They must
have sturdy arms to row and brave hearts to encounter perils,
or we shall never win the Golden Fleece.       

       Go,        replied the oaken image,        go, summon all the heroes
of Greece.       

And, in fact, considering what a great deed was to be done,
could any advice be wiser than this which Jason received from
the figurehead of his vessel? He lost no time in sending
messengers to all the cities, and making known to the whole
people of Greece that Prince Jason, the son of King        son,
was going in quest of the Fleece of Gold, and he desired the
help of forty-nine of the bravest and strongest young men
alive, to row his vessel and share his dangers. And Jason
himself would be the fiftieth.

At this news the adventurous youths all over the country
began to bestir themselves. Some of them had already fought
with giants and slain dragons; and the younger ones, who had
not yet met with such good fortune, thought it a shame to
have lived so long without getting astride of a flying serpent
or sticking their spears into a Chim       ra, or at least thrusting
their right arms down a monstrous lion's throat. There was
a fair prospect that they would meet with plenty of such
adventures before finding the Golden Fleece. As soon as they[Pg 82]
could furbish up their helmets and shields, therefore, and gird
on their trusty swords, they came thronging to Iolchos and
clambered on board the new galley. Shaking hands with
Jason, they assured him that they did not care a pin for their
lives, but would help row the vessel to the remotest edge of
the world and as much further as he might think it best to go.

Many of these brave fellows had been educated by Chiron,
the four-footed pedagogue, and were therefore old schoolmates
of Jason and knew him to be a lad of spirit. The mighty
Hercules, whose shoulders afterward held up the sky, was one
of them. And there were Castor and Pollux, the twin brothers,
who were never accused of being chicken-hearted, although
they had been hatched out of an egg; and Theseus, who was
so renowned for killing the Minotaur; and Lynceus, with his
wonderfully sharp eyes, which could see through a millstone
or look right down into the depths of the earth and discover
the treasures that were there; and Orpheus, the very best of
harpers, who sang and played upon his lyre so sweetly that
the brute beasts stood upon their hind legs and capered merrily
to the music. Yes, and at some of his more moving tunes the
rocks bestirred their moss-grown bulk out of the ground, and
a grove of forest trees uprooted themselves and, nodding their
tops to one another, performed a country dance.

One of the rowers was a beautiful young woman named
Atalanta, who had been nursed among the mountains by a
bear. So light of foot was this fair damsel that she could step
from one foamy crest of a wave to the foamy crest of another
without wetting more than the sole of her sandal. She had
grown up in a very wild way and talked much about the rights
of women, and loved hunting and war far better than her
needle. But in my opinion, the most remarkable of this
famous company were two sons of the North Wind (airy
youngsters, and of rather a blustering disposition), who had[Pg 83]
wings on their shoulders, and, in case of a calm, could puff
out their cheeks and blow almost as fresh a breeze as their
father. I ought not to forget the prophets and conjurers,
of whom there were several in the crew, and who could foretell
what would happen tomorrow, or the next day, or a hundred
years hence, but were generally quite unconscious of what was
passing at the moment.

Jason appointed Tiphys to be helmsman, because he was a
star-gazer and knew the points of the compass. Lynceus, on
account of his sharp sight, was stationed as a lookout in the
prow, where he saw a whole day's sail ahead, but was rather
apt to overlook things that lay directly under his nose. If
the sea only happened to be deep enough, however, Lynceus
could tell you exactly what kind of rocks or sands were at the
bottom of it; and he often cried out to his companions that
they were sailing over heaps of sunken treasure, which yet he
was none the richer for beholding. To confess the truth, few
people believed him when he said it.

Well! But when the Argonauts, as these fifty brave adventurers
were called, had prepared everything for the voyage,
an unforeseen difficulty threatened to end it before it was
begun. The vessel, you must understand, was so long and
broad and ponderous that the united force of all the fifty was
insufficient to shove her into the water. Hercules, I suppose,
had not grown to his full strength, else he might have set her
afloat as easily as a little boy launches his boat upon a puddle.
But here were these fifty heroes, pushing and straining and
growing red in the face without making the Argo start an
inch. At last, quite wearied out, they sat themselves down on
the shore, exceedingly disconsolate and thinking that the
vessel must be left to rot and fall in pieces and that they must
either swim across the sea or lose the Golden Fleece.

All at once Jason bethought himself of the galley's miraculous
figurehead.

[Pg 84]       Oh, daughter of the Talking Oak,        cried he,        how shall
we set to work to get our vessel into the water?       

       Seat yourselves,        answered the image (for it had known
what had ought to be done from the very first and was only
waiting for the question to be put),        seat yourselves and handle
your oars, and let Orpheus play upon his harp.       

Immediately the fifty heroes got on board, and seizing their
oars, held them perpendicularly in the air, while Orpheus
(who liked such a task far better than rowing) swept his
fingers across the harp. At the first ringing note of the music
they felt the vessel stir. Orpheus thrummed away briskly
and the galley slid at once into the sea, dipping her prow so
deeply that the figurehead drank the wave with its marvelous
lips, and rising again as buoyant as a swan. The rowers
plied their fifty oars, the white foam boiled up before the prow,
the water gurgled and bubbled in their wake, while Orpheus
continued to play so lively a strain of music that the vessel
seemed to dance over the billows by way of keeping time to it.
Thus triumphantly did the Argo sail out of the harbor amid
the huzzas and good wishes of everybody except the wicked
old Pelias, who stood on a promontory scowling at her and
wishing that he could blow out of his lungs the tempest of
wrath that was in his heart and so sink the galley with all on
board. When they had sailed above fifty miles over the sea
Lynceus happened to cast his sharp eyes behind, and said
that there was this bad-hearted king, still perched upon the
promontory, and scowling so gloomily that it looked like a
black thunder-cloud in that quarter of the horizon.

In order to make the time pass away more pleasantly during
the voyage, the heroes talked about the Golden Fleece. It
originally belonged, it appears, to a B      otian ram, who had
taken on his back two children, when in danger of their lives,
and fled with them over land and sea as far as Colchis. One[Pg 85]
of the children, whose name was Helle, fell into the sea and
was drowned. But the other (a little boy named Phrixus)
was brought safe ashore by the faithful ram, who, however,
was so exhausted that he immediately lay down and died.
In memory of this good deed, and as a token of his true heart,
the fleece of the poor dead ram was miraculously changed
to gold and became one of the most beautiful objects ever seen
on earth. It was hung upon a tree in a sacred grove, where
it had now been kept I know not how many years, and was
the envy of mighty kings who had nothing so magnificent in
any of their palaces.

If I were to tell you all the adventures of the Argonauts
it would take me till nightfall and perhaps a great deal longer.
There was no lack of wonderful events, as you may judge
from what you have already heard. At a certain island they
were hospitably received by King Cyzicus, its sovereign,
who made a feast for them and treated them like brothers.
But the Argonauts saw that this good king looked downcast
and very much troubled, and they therefore inquired of him
what was the matter. King Cyzicus hereupon informed
them that he and his subjects were greatly abused and incommoded
by the inhabitants of a neighboring mountain, who
made war upon them and killed many people and ravaged the
country. And while they were talking about it Cyzicus
pointed to the mountain and asked Jason and his companions
what they saw there.

       I see some very tall objects,        answered Jason,        but they
are at such a distance that I cannot distinctly make out what
they are. To tell your majesty the truth, they look so very
strangely that I am inclined to think them clouds which have
chanced to take something like human shapes.       

       I see them very plainly,        remarked Lynceus, whose eyes,
you know, were as far-sighted as a telescope.        They are a[Pg 86]
band of enormous giants, all of whom have six arms apiece,
and a club, a sword or some other weapon in each of their
hands.       

       You have excellent eyes,        said King Cyzicus.        Yes, they
are six-armed giants, as you say, and these are the enemies
whom I and my subjects have to contend with.       

The next day, when the Argonauts were about setting sail,
down came these terrible giants, stepping a hundred yards at
a stride, brandishing their six arms apiece and looking very
formidable so far aloft in the air. Each of these monsters
was able to carry on a whole war by himself, for with one of
his arms he could fling immense stones and wield a club with
another and a sword with a third, while a fourth was poking
a long spear at the enemy and the fifth and sixth were shooting
him with a bow and arrow. But luckily, though the giants
were so huge and had so many arms, they had each but one
heart and that no bigger nor braver than the heart of an
ordinary man. Besides, if they had been like the hundred-armed
Briareus, the brave Argonauts would have given them
their hands full of fight. Jason and his friends went boldly
to meet them, slew a great many and made the rest take to
their heels       so that if the giants had had six legs apiece instead
of six arms, it would have served them better to run away with.

Another strange adventure happened when the voyagers
came to Thrace, where they found a poor blind king named
Phineus, deserted by his subjects and living in a very sorrowful
way all by himself. On Jason's inquiring whether they could
do him any service, the king answered that he was terribly
tormented by three great winged creatures called Harpies,
which had the faces of women and the wings, bodies and claws
of vultures. These ugly wretches were in the habit of snatching
away his dinner, and allowed him no peace of his life.
Upon hearing this the Argonauts spread a plentiful feast[Pg 87]
on the seashore, well knowing from what the blind king said
of their greediness that the Harpies would snuff up the scent
of the victuals and quickly come to steal them away. And so
it turned out, for hardly was the table set before the three
hideous vulture-women came flapping their wings, seized the
food in their talons and flew off as fast as they could. But
the two sons of the North Wind drew their swords, spread
their pinions and set off through the air in pursuit of the
thieves, whom they at last overtook among some islands, after
a chase of hundreds of miles. The two winged youths blustered
terribly at the Harpies (for they had the rough temper of
their father), and so frightened them with their drawn swords
that they solemnly promised never to trouble King Phineus
again.

Then the Argonauts sailed onward and met with many
other marvelous incidents, any one of which would make a
story by itself. At one time they landed on an island and
were reposing on the grass, when they suddenly found themselves
assailed by what seemed a shower of steel-headed
arrows. Some of them stuck in the ground, while others hit
against their shields and several penetrated their flesh. The
fifty heroes started up and looked about them for the hidden
enemy, but could find none nor see any spot on the whole
island where even a single archer could lie concealed. Still,
however, the steel-headed arrows came whizzing among them;
and, at last, happening to look upward, they beheld a large
flock of birds hovering and wheeling aloft and shooting their
feathers down upon the Argonauts. These feathers were the
steel-headed arrows that had so tormented them. There was
no possibility of making any resistance, and the fifty heroic
Argonauts might all have been killed or wounded by a flock
of troublesome birds without ever setting eyes on the Golden
Fleece if Jason had not thought of asking the advice of the
oaken image.

[Pg 88]So he ran to the galley as fast as his legs would carry him.

       O daughter of the Speaking Oak,        cried he, all out of
breath,        we need your wisdom more than ever before! We
are in great peril from a flock of birds, who are shooting us
with their steel-pointed feathers. What can we do to drive
them away?       

       Make a clatter on your shields,        said the image.

On receiving this excellent counsel, Jason hurried back to
his companions (who were far more dismayed than when they
fought with the six-armed giants) and bade them strike with
their swords upon their brazen shields. Forthwith the fifty
heroes set heartily to work, banging with might and main,
and raised such a terrible clatter that the birds made what
haste they could to get away; and though they had shot half
the feathers out of their wings, they were soon seen skimming
among the clouds, a long distance off and looking like a flock
of wild geese. Orpheus celebrated this victory by playing a
triumphant anthem on his harp, and sang so melodiously
that Jason begged him to desist, lest, as the steel-feathered
birds had been driven away by an ugly sound, they might be
enticed back again by a sweet one.

While the Argonauts remained on this island they saw a
small vessel approaching the shore, in which were two young
men of princely demeanor, and exceedingly handsome, as
young princes generally were in those days. Now, who do
you imagine these two voyagers turned out to be? Why, if
you will believe me, they were the sons of that very Phrixus,
who in his childhood had been carried to Colchis on the back
of the golden-fleeced ram. Since that time Phrixus had married
the king's daughter, and the two young princes had been
born and brought up at Colchis, and had spent their play days
on the outskirts of the grove, in the center of which the Golden
Fleece was hanging upon a tree. They were now on their way[Pg 89]
to Greece, in hopes of getting back a kingdom that had been
wrongfully taken from their father.

When the princes understood whither the Argonauts were
going they offered to turn back and guide them to Colchis.
At the same time, however, they spoke as if it were very doubtful
whether Jason would succeed in getting the Golden
Fleece. According to their account, the tree on which it
hung was guarded by a terrible dragon, who never failed to
devour at one mouthful every person who might venture
within his reach.

       There are other difficulties in the way,        continued the
young princes.        But is not this enough? Ah, brave Jason,
turn back before it is too late! It would grieve us to the heart
if you and your forty-nine brave companions should be eaten
up, at fifty mouthfuls, by this execrable dragon.       

       My young friends,        quietly replied Jason,        I do not wonder
that you think the dragon very terrible. You have grown up
from infancy in the fear of this monster, and therefore still
regard him with the awe that children feel for the bugbears
and hobgoblins which their nurses have talked to them about.
But in my view of the matter, the dragon is merely a pretty
large serpent who is not half so likely to snap me up at one
mouthful as I am to cut off his ugly head and strip the skin
from his body. At all events, turn back who may, I will
never see Greece again unless I carry with me the Golden
Fleece.       

       We will none of us turn back!        cried his forty-nine brave
comrades.        Let us get on board the galley this instant,
and if the dragon is to make a breakfast of us, much good may
it do him.       

And Orpheus (whose custom it was to set everything to
music) began to harp and sing most gloriously, and made
every mother's son of them feel as if nothing in this world[Pg 90]
were so delectable as to fight dragons and nothing so truly honorable
as to be eaten up at one mouthful, in case of the worst.

After this (being now under the guidance of the two princes,
who were well acquainted with the way) they quickly sailed
to Colchis. When the king of the country, whose name was
       etes, heard of their arrival, he instantly summoned Jason to
court. The king was a stern and cruel-looking potentate,
and though he put on as polite and hospitable an expression
as he could, Jason did not like his face a whit better than that
of the wicked King Pelias, who dethroned his father.

       You are welcome, brave Jason,        said King        etes.        Pray,
are you on a pleasure voyage?       or do you meditate the discovery
of unknown islands?       or what other cause has procured
me the happiness of seeing you at my court?       

       Great sir,        replied Jason, with an obeisance       for Chiron
had taught him how to behave with propriety, whether to
kings or beggars-.       I have come hither with a purpose which
I now beg your majesty's permission to execute. King Pelias,
who sits on my father's throne (to which he has no more right
than to the one on which your excellent majesty is now
seated), has engaged to come down from it and to give me his
crown and scepter, provided I bring him the Golden Fleece.
This, as your majesty is aware, is now hanging on a tree here
at Colchis; and I humbly solicit your gracious leave to take
it away.       

In spite of himself, the king's face twisted itself into an
angry frown; for, above all things else in the world, he prized
the Golden Fleece, and was even suspected of having done a
very wicked act in order to get it into his own possession.
It put him into the worst possible humor, therefore, to hear
that the gallant Prince Jason and forty-nine of the bravest
young warriors of Greece had come to Colchis with the sole
purpose of taking away his chief treasure.

[Pg 91]       Do you know,        asked King        etes, eyeing Jason very
sternly,        what are the conditions which you must fulfill
before getting possession of the Golden Fleece?       

       I have heard,        rejoined the youth,        that a dragon lies
beneath the tree on which the prize hangs, and that whoever
approaches him runs the risk of being devoured at a
mouthful.       

       True,        said the king, with a smile that did not look
particularly good-natured.        Very true, young man. But
there are other things as hard, or perhaps a little harder, to be
done before you can even have the privilege of being devoured
by the dragon. For example, you must first tame my two
brazen-footed and brazen-lunged bulls, which Vulcan, the
wonderful blacksmith, made for me. There is a furnace in
each of their stomachs, and they breathe such hot fire out of
their mouths and nostrils that nobody has hitherto gone nigh
them without being instantly burned to a small, black cinder.
What do you think of this, my brave Jason?       

       I must encounter the peril,        answered Jason composedly,
       since it stands in the way of my purpose.       

       After taming the fiery bulls,        continued King        etes,
who was determined to scare Jason if possible,        you must yoke
them to a plow and must plow the sacred earth in the grove
of Mars and sow some of the same dragon's teeth from which
Cadmus raised a crop of armed men. They are an unruly
set of reprobates, those sons of the dragon's teeth, and unless
you treat them suitably, they will fall upon you sword in hand.
You and your forty-nine Argonauts, my bold Jason, are hardly
numerous or strong enough to fight with such a host as will
spring up.       

       My master Chiron,        replied Jason,        taught me long ago
the story of Cadmus. Perhaps I can manage the quarrelsome
sons of the dragon's teeth as well as Cadmus did.       

[Pg 92]       I wish the dragon had him,        muttered King        etes to
himself,        and the four-footed pedant, his schoolmaster, into
the bargain. Why, what a foolhardy, self-conceited coxcomb
he is! We'll see what my fire-breathing bulls will do for him.
Well, Prince Jason,        he continued aloud, and as complacently
as he could,        make yourself comfortable for today, and tomorrow
morning, since you insist upon it, you shall try your
skill at the plow.       

While the king talked with Jason a beautiful young woman
was standing behind the throne. She fixed her eyes earnestly
upon the youthful stranger and listened attentively to every
word that was spoken, and when Jason withdrew from the
king's presence this young woman followed him out of the
room.

       I am the king's daughter,        she said to him,        and my name
is Medea. I know a great deal of which other young princesses
are ignorant and can do many things which they would
be afraid so much as to dream of. If you will trust to me I can
instruct you how to tame the fiery bulls and sow the dragon's
teeth and get the Golden Fleece.       

       Indeed, beautiful princess,        answered Jason,        if you will
do me this service I promise to be grateful to you my whole
life long.       

Gazing at Medea, he beheld a wonderful intelligence in her
face. She was one of those persons whose eyes are full of
mystery; so that while looking into them, you seem to see a
very great way, as into a deep well, yet can never be certain
whether you see into the furthest depths or whether there be
not something else hidden at the bottom. If Jason had been
capable of fearing anything he would have been afraid of making
this young princess his enemy; for, beautiful as she now
looked, she might the very next instant become as terrible as
the dragon that kept watch over the Golden Fleece.

[Pg 93]       Princess,        he exclaimed,        you seem indeed very wise and
very powerful. But how can you help me to do the things
of which you speak? Are you an enchantress?       

       Yes, Prince Jason,        answered Medea, with a smile,
       you have hit upon the truth. I am an enchantress. Circe,
my father's sister, taught me to be one, and I could tell you,
if I pleased, who was the old woman with the peacock, the
pomegranate and the cuckoo staff, whom you carried over
the river; and likewise, who it is that speaks through the lips
of the oaken image that stands in the prow of your galley.
I am acquainted with some of your secrets, you perceive.
It is well for you that I am favorably inclined, for otherwise
you would hardly escape being snapped up by the dragon.       

       I should not so much care for the dragon,        replied Jason,
       if I only knew how to manage the brazen-footed and fiery-lunged
bulls.       

       If you are as brave as I think you, and as you have need
to be,        said Medea,        your own bold heart will teach you that
there is but one way of dealing with a mad bull. What it is
I leave you to find out in the moment of peril. As for the fiery
breath of these animals, I have a charmed ointment here
which will prevent you from being burned up and cure you
if you chance to be a little scorched.       

So she put a golden box into his hand and directed him
how to apply the perfumed unguent which it contained, and
where to meet her at midnight.

       Only be brave,        added she,        and before daybreak the
brazen bulls shall be tamed.       

The young man assured her that his heart would not fail
him. He then rejoined his comrades, and told them what
had passed between the princess and himself, and warned
them to be in readiness in case there might be need of their
help.

[Pg 94]At the appointed hour he met the beautiful Medea on the
marble steps of the king's palace. She gave him a basket,
in which were the dragon's teeth, just as they had been pulled
out of the monster's jaws by Cadmus long ago. Medea then
led Jason down the palace steps and through the silent streets
of the city and into the royal pasture-ground, where the two
brazen-footed bulls were kept. It was a starry night, with a
bright gleam along the eastern edge of the sky, where the moon
was soon going to show herself. After entering the pasture
the princess paused and looked around.

       There they are,        said she,        reposing themselves and chewing
their fiery cuds in that furthest corner of the field. It will
be excellent sport, I assure you, when they catch a glimpse of
your figure. My father and all his court delight in nothing
so much as to see a stranger trying to yoke them in order
to come at the Golden Fleece. It makes a holiday in Colchis
whenever such a thing happens. For my part, I enjoy it
immensely. You cannot imagine in what a mere twinkling
of an eye their hot breath shrivels a young man into a black
cinder.       

       Are you sure, beautiful Medea,        asked Jason,        quite
sure, that the unguent in the gold box will prove a remedy
against those terrible burns?       

       If you doubt, if you are in the least afraid,        said the
princess, looking him in the face by the dim starlight,        you
had better never have been born than go a step nigher to the
bulls.       

But Jason had set his heart steadfastly on getting the
Golden Fleece, and I positively doubt whether he would have
gone back without it even had he been certain of finding
himself turned into a red-hot cinder, or a handful of white
ashes the instant he made a step further. He therefore let
go Medea's hand and walked boldly forward in the direction[Pg 95]
whither she had pointed. At some distance before him he
perceived four streams of fiery vapor, regularly appearing
and again vanishing after dimly lighting up the surrounding
obscurity. These, you will understand, were caused by the
breath of the brazen bulls, which was quietly stealing out of
their four nostrils as they lay chewing their cuds.

At the first two or three steps which Jason made the four
fiery streams appeared to gush out somewhat more plentifully,
for the two brazen bulls had heard his foot-tramp and were
lifting up their hot noses to snuff the air. He went a little
further, and by the way in which the red vapor now spouted
forth he judged that the creatures had got upon their feet.
Now he could see glowing sparks and vivid jets of flame. At
the next step each of the bulls made the pasture echo with a
terrible roar, while the burning breath which they thus belched
forth lit up the whole field with a momentary flash.

One other stride did bold Jason make; and suddenly, as a
streak of lightning, on came these fiery animals, roaring like
thunder and sending out sheets of white flame, which so kindled
up the scene that the young man could discern every object
more distinctly than by daylight. Most distinctly of all he
saw the two horrible creatures galloping right down upon him,
their brazen hoofs rattling and ringing over the ground and
their tails sticking up stiffly into the air, as has always been the
fashion with angry bulls. Their breath scorched the herbage
before them. So intensely hot it was, indeed, that it caught
a dry tree under which Jason was now standing and set it all
in a light blaze. But as for Jason himself (thanks to Medea's
enchanted ointment), the white flame curled around his body
without injuring him a jot more than if he had been made of
asbestos.

Greatly encouraged at finding himself not yet turned into a
cinder, the young man awaited the attack of the bulls. Just[Pg 96]
as the brazen brutes fancied themselves sure of tossing him
into the air he caught one of them by the horn and the other
by his screwed-up tail and held them in a grip like that of an
iron vise, one with his right hand, the other with his left.
Well, he must have been wonderfully strong in his arms, to
be sure! But the secret of the matter was that the brazen
bulls were enchanted creatures and that Jason had broken
the spell of their fiery fierceness by his bold way of handling
them. And ever since that time it has been the favorite
method of brave men, when danger assails them, to do what
they call        taking the bull by the horn.       ; and to grip him by
the tail is pretty much the same thing       that is, to throw
aside fear and overcome the peril by despising it.

It was now easy to yoke the bulls and to harness them to
the plow which had lain rusting on the ground for a great
many years gone by, so long was it before anybody could be
found capable of plowing that piece of land. Jason, I suppose,
had been taught how to draw a furrow by the good old Chiron,
who, perhaps, used to allow himself to be harnessed to the
plow. At any rate, our hero succeeded perfectly well in breaking
up the greensward; and by the time that the moon was a
quarter of her journey up the sky the plowed field lay before
him, a large tract of black earth, ready to be sown with the
dragon's teeth. So Jason scattered them broadcast and
harrowed them into the soil with a brush-harrow, and took
his stand on the edge of the field, anxious to see what would
happen next.

       Must we wait long for harvest-time?        he inquired of
Medea, who was now standing by his side.

       Whether sooner or later, it will be sure to come,        answered
the princess.        A crop of armed men never fails to spring up
when the dragon's teeth have been sown.       



The dragon fell at full length upon the ground






The blind       dipus, led by his daughter Antigone


[Pg 97]
The moon was now high aloft in the heavens and threw its
bright beams over the plowed field, where as yet there was
nothing to be seen. Any farmer, on viewing it, would have
said that Jason must wait weeks before the green blades would
peep from among the clods, and whole months before the
yellow grain would be ripened for the sickle. But by and by,
all over the field, there was something that glistened in the
moonbeams like sparkling drops of dew. These bright objects
sprouted higher and proved to be the steel heads of spears.
Then there was a dazzling gleam from a vast number of
polished brass helmets, beneath which, as they grew further
out of the soil, appeared the dark and bearded visages of
warriors, struggling to free themselves from the imprisoning
earth. The first look that they gave at the upper world was a
glare of wrath and defiance. Next were seen their bright
breastplates; in every right hand there was a sword or a
spear and on each left arm a shield; and when this strange
crop of warriors had but half grown out of the earth, they
struggled       such was their impatience of restraint       and, as
it were, tore themselves up by the roots. Wherever a dragon's
tooth had fallen, there stood a man armed for battle. They
made a clangor with their swords against their shields, and
eyed one another fiercely; for they had come into this beautiful
world and into the peaceful moonlight full of rage and
stormy passions and ready to take the life of every human
brother in recompense for the boon of their own existence.

There have been many other armies in the world that seemed
to possess the same fierce nature with the one which had now
sprouted from the dragon's teeth; but these in the moonlit
field were the more excusable, because they never had women
for their mothers. And now it would have rejoiced any great
captain who was bent on conquering the world, like Alexander
or Napoleon, to raise a crop of armed soldiers as easily as
Jason did!

[Pg 98]For awhile the warriors stood flourishing their weapons,
clashing their swords against their shields and boiling over
with the red-hot thirst for battle. Then they began to shout,
       Show us the enemy! Lead us to the charge! Death or
victory! Come on, brave comrades! Conquer or die!        and
a hundred other outcries, such as men always bellow forth
on a battle-field and which these dragon people seemed to have
at their tongues' ends. At last the front rank caught sight
of Jason, who, beholding the flash of so many weapons in the
moonlight, had thought it best to draw his sword. In a
moment all the sons of the dragon's teeth appeared to take
Jason for an enemy; and crying with one voice,        Guard the
Golden Fleece!        they ran at him with uplifted swords and
protruded spears. Jason knew that it would be impossible
to withstand this blood-thirsty battalion with his single arm,
but determined, since there was nothing better to be done,
to die as valiantly as if he himself had sprung from a dragon's
tooth.

Medea, however, bade him snatch up a stone from the
ground.

       Throw it among them quickly!        cried she.        It is the
only way to save yourself.       

The armed men were now so nigh that Jason could discern
the fire flashing out of their enraged eyes, when he let fly the
stone and saw it strike the helmet of a tall warrior who was
rushing upon him with his blade aloft. The stone glanced
from this man's helmet to the shield of his nearest comrade,
and thence flew right into the angry face of another, hitting
him smartly between the eyes. Each of the three who had
been struck by the stone took it for granted that his next
neighbor had given him a blow; and instead of running any
further toward Jason, they began to fight among themselves.
The confusion spread through the host, so that it seemed[Pg 99]
scarcely a moment before they were all hacking, hewing and
stabbing at one another, lopping off arms, heads and legs and
doing such memorable deeds that Jason was filled with immense
admiration; although, at the same time, he could not help
laughing to behold these mighty men punishing each other
for an offense which he himself had committed. In an incredibly
short space of time (almost as short, indeed, as it
had taken them to grow up) all but one of the heroes of the
dragon's teeth were stretched lifeless on the field. The last
survivor, the bravest and strongest of the whole, had just
force enough to wave his crimson sword over his head and give
a shout of exultation, crying,        Victory! Victory! Immortal
fame!        when he himself fell down and lay quietly among his
slain brethren.

And there was the end of the army that had sprouted from
the dragon's teeth. That fierce and feverish fight was the
only enjoyment which they had tasted on this beautiful earth.

       Let them sleep in the bed of honor,        said the Princess
Medea, with a sly smile at Jason.        The world will always
have simpletons enough, just like them, fighting and dying for
they know not what, and fancying that posterity will take the
trouble to put laurel wreaths on their rusty and battered
helmets. Could you help smiling, Prince Jason, to see the
self-conceit of that last fellow, just as he tumbled down?       

       It made me very sad,        answered Jason gravely.        And
to tell you the truth, princess, the Golden Fleece does not
appear so well worth the winning, after what I have here
beheld.       

       You will think differently in the morning,        said Medea.
       True, the Golden Fleece may not be so valuable as you have
thought it; but then there is nothing better in the world, and
one must needs have an object, you know. Come! Your
night's work has been well performed; and tomorrow you can[Pg 100]
inform King        etes that the first part of your allotted task is
fulfilled.       

Agreeably to Medea's advice, Jason went betimes in the
morning to the palace of king        etes. Entering the presence
chamber, he stood at the foot of the throne and made a low
obeisance.

       Your eyes look heavy, Prince Jason,        observed the king;
       you appear to have spent a sleepless night. I hope you have
been considering the matter a little more wisely and have concluded
not to get yourself scorched to a cinder in attempting
to tame my brazen-lunged bulls.       

       That is already accomplished, may it please your majesty,       
replied Jason.        The bulls have been tamed and yoked;
the field has been plowed; the dragon's teeth have been sown
broadcast and harrowed into the soil; the crop of armed
warriors has sprung up and they have slain one another
to the last man. And now I solicit your majesty's permission
to encounter the dragon, that I may take down the Golden
Fleece from the tree and depart with my forty-nine comrades.       

King        etes scowled and looked very angry and excessively
disturbed; for he knew that, in accordance with his kingly
promise, he ought now to permit Jason to win the fleece if
his courage and skill should enable him to do so. But since
the young man had met with such good luck in the matter of
the brazen bulls and dragon's teeth, the king feared that he
would be equally successful in slaying the dragon. And
therefore, though he would gladly have seen Jason snapped
up at a mouthful, he was resolved (and it was a very wrong
thing of this wicked potentate) not to run any further risk
of losing his beloved fleece.

       You never would have succeeded in this business, young
man,        said he,        if my undutiful daughter Medea had not
helped you with her enchantments. Had you acted fairly,[Pg 101]
you would have been at this instant a black cinder or a handful
of white ashes. I forbid you, on pain of death, to make any
more attempts to get the Golden Fleece. To speak my mind
plainly, you shall never set eyes on so much as one of its
glistening locks.       

Jason left the king's presence in great sorrow and anger.
He could think of nothing better to be done than to summon
together his forty-nine brave Argonauts, march at once to
the grove of Mars, slay the dragon, take possession of the
Golden Fleece, get on board the Argo and spread all sail for
Iolchos. The success of this scheme depended, it is true, on
the doubtful point whether all the fifty heroes might not be
snapped up as so many mouthfuls by the dragon. But as
Jason was hastening down the palace steps, the Princess
Medea called after him and beckoned him to return. Her
black eyes shone upon him with such a keen intelligence that
he felt as if there were a serpent peeping out of them, and
although she had done him so much service only the night
before, he was by no means very certain that she would not
do him an equally great mischief before sunset. These
enchantresses, you must know, are never to be depended
upon.

       What says King        etes, my royal and upright father?       
inquired Medea, slightly smiling.        Will he give you the
Golden Fleece without any further risk or trouble?       

       On the contrary,        answered Jason,        he is very angry with
me for taming the brazen bulls and sowing the dragon's teeth.
And he forbids me to make any more attempts, and positively
refuses to give up the Golden Fleece, whether I slay the
dragon or no.       

       Yes, Jason,        said the princess,        and I can tell you more.
Unless you set sail from Colchis before tomorrow's sunrise,
the king means to burn your fifty-oared galley and put yourself[Pg 102]
and your forty-nine brave comrades to the sword. But
be of good courage. The Golden Fleece you shall have if it
lies within the power of my enchantments to get it for you.
Wait for me here an hour before midnight.       

At the appointed hour you might again have seen Prince
Jason and the Princess Medea, side by side, stealing through
the streets of Colchis on their way to the sacred grove, in the
center of which the Golden Fleece was suspended to a tree.
While they were crossing the pasture ground the brazen bulls
came toward Jason, lowing, nodding their heads and thrusting
forth their snouts, which, as other cattle do, they loved to
have rubbed and caressed by a friendly hand. Their fierce
nature was thoroughly tamed; and with their fierceness, the
two furnaces in their stomaches had likewise been extinguished,
insomuch that they probably enjoyed far more comfort in
grazing and chewing their cuds than ever before. Indeed,
it had heretofore been a great inconvenience to these poor
animals that, whenever they wished to eat a mouthful of grass,
the fire out of their nostrils had shriveled it up before they
could manage to crop it. How they contrived to keep themselves
alive is more than I can imagine. But now, instead of
emitting jets of flame and streams of sulphurous vapor, they
breathed the very sweetest of cow breath.

After kindly patting the bulls, Jason followed Medea's
guidance into the Grove of Mars, where the great oak trees
that had been growing for centuries threw so thick a shade
that the moonbeams struggled vainly to find their way through
it. Only here and there a glimmer fell upon the leaf-strewn
earth, or now and then a breeze stirred the boughs aside and
gave Jason a glimpse of the sky, lest in that deep obscurity
he might forget that there was one overhead. At length,
when they had gone further and further into the heart of
the duskiness, Medea squeezed Jason's hand.

[Pg 103]       Look yonder,        she whispered.        Do you see it?       

Gleaming among the venerable oaks there was a radiance,
not like the moonbeams, but rather resembling the golden
glory of the setting sun. It proceeded from an object which
appeared to be suspended at about a man's height from the
ground, a little further within the wood.

       What is it?        asked Jason.

       Have you come so far to seek it,        exclaimed Medea,
       and do you not recognize the meed of all your toils and perils
when it glitters before your eyes? It is the Golden Fleece.       

Jason went onward a few steps further, and then stopped
to gaze. Oh, how beautiful it looked, shining with a marvelous
light of its own, that inestimable prize which so many heroes
had longed to behold but had perished in the quest of it,
either by the perils of their voyage or by the fiery breath of
the brazen-lunged bulls.

       How gloriously it shines!        cried Jason in a rapture.
       It has surely been dipped in the richest gold of sunset. Let
me hasten onward and take it to my bosom.       

       Stay,        said Medea, holding him back.        Have you forgotten
what guards it?       

To say the truth, in the joy of beholding the object of his
desires, the terrible dragon had quite slipped out of Jason's
memory. Soon, however, something came to pass that
reminded him what perils were still to be encountered. An
antelope that probably mistook the yellow radiance for
sunrise came bounding fleetly through the grove. He was
rushing straight toward the Golden Fleece, when suddenly
there was a frightful hiss and the immense head and half
the scaly body of the dragon was thrust forth (for he was
twisted round the trunk of the tree on which the fleece hung),
and seizing the poor antelope, swallowed him with one snap
of his jaws.

[Pg 104]After this feat, the dragon seemed sensible that some other
living creature was within reach, on which he felt inclined to
finish his meal. In various directions he kept poking his ugly
snout among the trees, stretching out his neck a terrible long
way, now here, now there and now close to the spot where
Jason and the princess were hiding behind an oak. Upon my
word, as the head came waving and undulating through the
air and reaching almost within arm's length of Prince Jason,
it was a very hideous and uncomfortable sight. The gape
of his enormous jaws was nearly as wide as the gateway of the
king's palace.

       Well, Jason,        whispered Medea (for she was ill natured,
as all enchantresses are, and wanted to make the bold youth
tremble),        what do you think now of your prospect of winning
the Golden Fleece?       

Jason answered only by drawing his sword and making a
step forward.

       Stay, foolish youth,        said Medea, grasping his arm.        Do
not you see you are lost without me as your good angel?
In this gold box I have a magic potion which will do the
dragon's business far more effectually than your sword.       

The dragon had probably heard the voices, for swift as
lightning his black head and forked tongue came hissing
among the trees again, darting full forty feet at a stretch.
As it approached, Medea tossed the contents of the gold box
right down the monster's wide-open throat. Immediately,
with an outrageous hiss and a tremendous wriggle       flinging
his tail up to the tip-top of the tallest tree and shattering all
its branches as it crashed heavily down again       the dragon
fell at full length upon the ground and lay quite motionless.

       It is only a sleeping potion,        said the enchantress to Prince
Jason.        One always finds a use for these mischievous creatures
sooner or later; so I did not wish to kill him outright.[Pg 105]
Quick! Snatch the prize and let us begone. You have won
the Golden Fleece.       

Jason caught the fleece from the tree and hurried through
the grove, the deep shadows of which were illuminated as
he passed, by the golden glory of the precious object that he
bore along. A little way before him he beheld the old woman
whom he had helped over the stream, with her peacock beside
her. She clapped her hands for joy, and beckoning him to
haste, disappeared among the duskiness of the trees. Espying
the two winged sons of the North Wind (who were disporting
themselves in the moonlight a few hundred feet aloft), Jason
bade them tell the rest of the Argonauts to embark as speedily
as possible. But Lynceus, with his sharp eyes, had already
caught a glimpse of him, bringing the Golden Fleece, although
several stone walls, a hill, and the black shadows of the Grove
of Mars intervened between. By his advice the heroes had
seated themselves on the benches of the galley, with their
oars held perpendicularly, ready to let fall into the water.

As Jason drew near he heard the Talking Image calling to
him with more than ordinary eagerness, in its grave, sweet
voice:

       Make haste. Prince Jason! For your life, make haste!       

With one bound he leaped aboard. At sight of the glorious
radiance of the Golden Fleece, the forty-nine heroes gave a
mighty shout, and Orpheus, striking his harp, sang a song of
triumph, to the cadence of which the galley flew over the
water, homeward bound, as if careering along with wings!

THE CYCLOPS
[Pg 106]

When the great city of Troy was taken, all the chiefs who
had fought against it set sail for their homes. But there was
wrath in heaven against them, for indeed they had borne
themselves haughtily and cruelly in the day of their victory.
Therefore they did not all find a safe and happy return.
For one was shipwrecked and another was shamefully slain
by his false wife in his palace, and others found all things at
home troubled and changed and were driven to seek new
dwellings elsewhere. And some, whose wives and friends
and people had been still true to them through those ten long
years of absence, were driven far and wide about the world
before they saw their native land again. And of all, the wise
Ulysses was he who wandered farthest and suffered most.

He was well-nigh the last to sail, for he had tarried many
days to do pleasure to Agamemnon, lord of all the Greeks.
Twelve ships he had with him       twelve he had brought to
Troy       and in each there were some fifty men, being scarce
half of those that had sailed in them in the old days, so many
valiant heroes slept the last sleep by Simo      s and Scamander
and in the plain and on the seashore, slain in battle or by the
shafts of Apollo.

First they sailed northwest to the Thracian coast, where
the Ciconians dwelt, who had helped the men of Troy. Their
city they took, and in it much plunder, slaves and oxen, and
jars of fragrant wine, and might have escaped unhurt, but
that they stayed to hold revel on the shore. For the Ciconians
gathered their neighbors, being men of the same blood, and
did battle with the invaders and drove them to their ship.[Pg 107]
And when Ulysses numbered his men, he found that he had
lost six out of each ship.

Scarce had he set out again when the wind began to blow
fiercely; so, seeing a smooth, sandy beach, they drove the
ships ashore and dragged them out of reach of the waves,
and waited till the storm should abate. And the third morning
being fair, they sailed again and journeyed prosperously till
they came to the very end of the great Peloponnesian land,
where Cape Malea looks out upon the southern sea. But
contrary currents baffled them, so that they could not round
it, and the north wind blew so strongly that they must fain
drive before it. And on the tenth day they came to the land
where the lotus grows       a wondrous fruit, of which whosoever
eats cares not to see country or wife or children again. Now
the Lotus eaters, for so they call the people of the land, were
a kindly folk and gave of the fruit to some of the sailors, not
meaning them any harm, but thinking it to be the best that
they had to give. These, when they had eaten, said that
they would not sail any more over the sea; which, when the
wise Ulysses heard, he bade their comrades bind them and
carry them, sadly complaining, to the ships.

Then, the wind having abated, they took to their oars and
rowed for many days till they came to the country where the
Cylopes dwell. Now, a mile or so from the shore there was
an island, very fair and fertile, but no man dwells there or
tills the soil, and in the island a harbor where a ship may be
safe from all winds, and at the head of the harbor a stream
falling from the rock, and whispering alders all about it. Into
this the ships passed safely and were hauled up on the beach,
and the crews slept by them, waiting for the morning. And
the next day they hunted the wild goats, of which there was
great store on the island, and feasted right merrily on what
they caught, with draughts of red wine which they had carried
off from the town of the Ciconians.

[Pg 108]But on the morrow, Ulysses, for he was ever fond of adventure
and would know of every land to which he came what
manner of men they were that dwelt there, took one of his
twelve ships and bade row to the land. There was a great
hill sloping to the shore, and there rose up here and there a
smoke from the caves where the Cylopes dwelt apart, holding
no converse with each other, for they were a rude and savage
folk, but ruled each his own household, not caring for others.
Now very close to the shore was one of these caves, very huge
and deep, with laurels round about the mouth, and in front
a fold with walls built of rough stone and shaded by tall oaks
and pines. So Ulysses chose out of the crew the twelve
bravest, and bade the rest guard the ship, and went to see
what manner of dwelling this was and who abode there. He
had his sword by his side, and on his shoulder a mighty skin
of wine, sweet smelling and strong, with which he might win
the heart of some fierce savage, should he chance to meet
with such, as indeed his prudent heart forecasted that he
might.

So they entered the cave and judged that it was the dwelling
of some rich and skilful shepherd. For within there were
pens for the young of the sheep and of the goats, divided all
according to their age, and there were baskets full of cheeses,
and full milk pails ranged along the wall. But the Cyclops
himself was away in the pastures. Then the companions of
Ulysses besought him that he would depart, taking with him,
if he would, a store of cheeses and sundry of the lambs and of
the kids. But he would not, for he wished to see, after his
wont, what manner of host this strange shepherd might be.
And truly he saw it to his cost!

It was evening when the Cyclops came home, a mighty
giant, twenty feet in height or more. On his shoulder he bore
a vast bundle of pine logs for his fire, and threw them down[Pg 109]
outside the cave with a great crash, and drove the flocks
within, and closed the entrance with a huge rock, which
twenty wagons and more could not bear. Then he milked
the ewes and all the she-goats, and half of the milk he curdled
for cheese and half he set ready for himself when he should
sup. Next he kindled a fire with the pine logs, and the flame
lighted up all the cave, showing Ulysses and his comrades.

       Who are ye?        cried Polyphemus, for that was the giant's
name.        Are ye traders or, haply, pirates?       

For in those days it was not counted shame to be called a
pirate.

Ulysses shuddered at the dreadful voice and shape, but
bore him bravely, and answered,        We are no pirates, mighty
sir, but Greeks, sailing back from Troy, and subjects of the
great King Agamemnon, whose fame is spread from one end
of heaven to the other. And we are come to beg hospitality
of thee in the name of Zeus, who rewards or punishes hosts
and guests according as they be faithful the one to the other,
or no.       

       Nay,        said the giant,        it is but idle talk to tell me of
Zeus and the other gods. We Cylopes take no account
of gods, holding ourselves to be much better and stronger than
they. But come, tell me where have you left your ship?       

But Ulysses saw his thought when he asked about the
ship, how he was minded to break it and take from them all
hope of flight. Therefore he answered him craftily:

       Ship have we none, for that which was ours King Poseidon
brake, driving it on a jutting rock on this coast, and we whom
thou seest are all that are escaped from the waves.       

Polyphemus answered nothing, but without more ado
caught up two of the men, as a man might catch up the whelps
of a dog, and dashed them on the ground, and tore them limb
from limb and devoured them, with huge draughts of milk[Pg 110]
between, leaving not a morsel, not even the very bones. But
the others, when they saw the dreadful deed, could only
weep and pray to Zeus for help. And when the giant had
ended his foul meal, he lay down among his sheep and slept.

Then Ulysses questioned much in his heart whether he
should slay the monster as he slept, for he doubted not that
his good sword would pierce to the giant's heart, mighty as he
was. But, being very wise, he remembered that, should he
slay him, he and his comrades would yet perish miserably.
For who should move away the great rock that lay against the
door of the cave? So they waited till the morning. And the
monster woke and milked his flocks, and afterward, seizing
two men, devoured them for his meal. Then he went to the
pastures, but put the great rock on the mouth of the cave,
just as a man puts down the lid upon his quiver.

All that day the wise Ulysses was thinking what he might
best do to save himself and his companions, and the end of
his thinking was this: There was a mighty pole in the cave,
green wood of an olive tree, big as a ship's mast, which Polyphemus
purposed to use, when the smoke should have dried
it, as a walking staff. Of this he cut off a fathom's length, and
his comrades sharpened it and hardened it in the fire and then
hid it away. At evening the giant came back and drove his
sheep into the cave, nor left the rams outside, as he had been
wont to do before, but shut them in. And having duly done
his shepherd's work, he made his cruel feast as before. Then
Ulysses came forward with the wine skin in his hand and
said:

       Drink, Cyclops, now that thou hast feasted. Drink and
see what precious things we had in our ship. But no one
hereafter will come to thee with such like, if thou dealest with
strangers as cruelly as thou hast dealt with us.       

Then the Cyclops drank and was mightily pleased, and said,[Pg 111]
       Give me again to drink and tell me thy name, stranger, and
I will give thee a gift such as a host should give. In good
truth this is a rare liquor. We, too, have vines, but they bear
no wine like this, which indeed must be such as the gods drink
in heaven.       

Then Ulysses gave him the cup again and he drank. Thrice
he gave it to him and thrice he drank, not knowing what it
was and how it would work within his brain.

Then Ulysses spake to him.        Thou didst ask my name,
Cyclops. Lo! my name is No Man. And now that thou
knowest my name, thou shouldst give me thy gift.       

And he said,        My gift shall be that I will eat thee last of
all thy company.       

And as he spake he fell back in a drunken sleep. Then
Ulysses bade his comrades be of good courage, for the time
was come when they should be delivered. And they thrust
the stake of olive wood into the fire till it was ready, green as
it was, to burst into flame, and they thrust it into the monster's
eye; for he had but one eye, and that in the midst of his forehead,
with the eyebrow below it. And Ulysses leaned with
all his force upon the stake and thrust it in with might and
main. And the burning wood hissed in the eye, just as the
red-hot iron hisses in the water when a man seeks to temper
steel for a sword.

Then the giant leapt up and tore away the stake and cried
aloud, so that all the Cylopes who dwelt on the mountain
side heard him and came about his cave, asking him,        What
aileth thee, Polyphemus, that thou makest this uproar in the
peaceful night, driving away sleep? Is any one robbing thee
of thy sheep or seeking to slay thee by craft or force?       

And the giant answered,        No Man slays me by craft.       

       Nay, but,        they said,        if no man does thee wrong, we
cannot help thee. The sickness which great Zeus may send,
who can avoid? Pray to our father, Poseidon, for help.       

[Pg 112]Then they departed, and Ulysses was glad at heart for the
good success of his device when he said that he was No Man.

But the Cyclops rolled away the great stone from the door
of the cave and sat in the midst, stretching out his hands
to feel whether perchance the men within the cave would
seek to go out among the sheep.

Long did Ulysses think how he and his comrades should
best escape. At last he lighted upon a good device, and much
he thanked Zeus for that this once the giant had driven the
rams with the other sheep into the cave. For, these being
great and strong, he fastened his comrades under the bellies
of the beasts, tying them with osier twigs, of which the giant
made his bed. One ram he took and fastened a man beneath
it, and two others he set, one on either side. So he did with
the six, for but six were left out of the twelve who had ventured
with him from the ship. And there was one mighty ram, far
larger than all the others, and to this Ulysses clung, grasping
the fleece tight with both his hands. So they waited for the
morning. And when the morning came, the rams rushed
forth to the pasture; but the giant sat in the door and felt
the back of each as it went by, nor thought to try what might
be underneath. Last of all went the great ram. And the
Cyclops knew him as he passed and said:

       How is this, thou, who art the leader of the flock? Thou
art not wont thus to lag behind. Thou hast always been the
first to run to the pastures and streams in the morning and
the first to come back to the fold when evening fell; and now
thou art last of all. Perhaps thou art troubled about thy
master's eye, which some wretch       No Man, they call him       has
destroyed, having first mastered me with wine. He has
not escaped, I ween. I would that thou couldst speak and
tell me where he is lurking. Of a truth I would dash out
his brains upon the ground and avenge me of this No Man.       

[Pg 113]So speaking, he let him pass out of the cave. But when
they were out of reach of the giant, Ulysses loosed his hold of
the ram and then unbound his comrades. And they hastened
to their ship, not forgetting to drive before them a good store
of the Cyclops' fat sheep. Right glad were those that had
abode by the ship to see them. Nor did they lament for those
that had died, though they were fain to do so, for Ulysses
forbade, fearing lest the noise of their weeping should betray
them to the giant, where they were. Then they all climbed
into the ship, and sitting well in order on the benches, smote
the sea with their oars, laying-to right lustily, that they might
the sooner get away from the accursed land. And when they
had rowed a hundred yards or so, so that a man's voice could
yet be heard by one who stood upon the shore, Ulysses stood
up in the ship and shouted:

       He was no coward, O Cyclops, whose comrades thou didst
so foully slay in thy den. Justly art thou punished, monster,
that devourest thy guests in thy dwelling. May the gods
make thee suffer yet worse things than these.       

Then the Cyclops in his wrath broke off the top of a great
hill, a mighty rock, and hurled it where he had heard the
voice. Right in front of the ship's bow it fell, and a great
wave rose as it sank, and washed the ship back to the shore.
But Ulysses seized a long pole with both hands and pushed
the ship from the land and bade his comrades ply their oars,
nodding with his head, for he was too wise to speak, lest the
Cyclops should know where they were. Then they rowed
with all their might and main.

And when they had gotten twice as far as before, Ulysses
made as if he would speak again; but his comrades sought to
hinder him, saying,        Nay, my lord, anger not the giant any
more. Surely we thought before we were lost, when he threw
the great rock and washed our ship back to the shore. And[Pg 114]
if he hear thee now, he may crush our ship and us, for the man
throws a mighty bolt and throws it far.       

But Ulysses would not be persuaded, but stood up and
said,        Hear, Cyclops! If any man ask who blinded thee,
say that it was the warrior Ulysses, son of Laertes, dwelling
in Ithaca.       

And the Cyclops answered with a groan,        Of a truth, the
old oracles are fulfilled, for long ago there came to this land
one Telemus, a prophet, and dwelt among us even to old age.
This man foretold me that one Ulysses would rob me of my
sight. But I looked for a great man and a strong, who should
subdue me by force, and now a weakling has done the deed,
having cheated me with wine. But come thou hither, Ulysses,
and I will be a host indeed to thee. Or, at least, may Poseidon
give thee such a voyage to thy home as I would wish thee to
have. For know that Poseidon is my sire. May be that he
may heal me of my grievous wound.       

And Ulysses said,        Would to God, I could send thee down
to the abode of the dead, where thou wouldst be past all
healing, even from Poseidon's self.       

Then Cyclops lifted up his hands to Poseidon and prayed:

       Hear me, Poseidon, if I am indeed thy son and thou my
father. May this Ulysses never reach his home! or, if the
Fates have ordered that he should reach it, may he come
alone, all his comrades lost, and come to find sore trouble in
his house!       

And as he ended he hurled another mighty rock, which
almost lighted on the rudder's end, yet missed it as if by a
hair's breadth. So Ulysses and his comrades escaped and
came to the island of the wild goats, where they found their
comrades, who indeed had waited long for them, in sore fear
lest they had perished. Then Ulysses divided among his
company all the sheep which they had taken from the Cyclops.[Pg 115]
And all, with one consent, gave him for his share the great
ram which had carried him out of the cave, and he sacrificed
it to Zeus. And all that day they feasted right merrily on
the flesh of sheep and on sweet wine, and when the night was
come, they lay down upon the shore and slept.

      DIPUS AND THE SPHINX
[Pg 116]

It befell in times past that the gods, being angry with the
inhabitants of Thebes, sent into their land a very troublesome
beast which men called the Sphinx. Now this beast had the
face and breast of a fair woman, but the feet and claws of a
lion; and it was wont to ask a riddle of such as encountered
it, and such as answered not aright it would tear and devour.

When it had laid waste the land many days, there chanced
to come to Thebes one       dipus, who had fled from the city of
Corinth that he might escape the doom which the gods had
spoken against him. And the men of the place told him of the
Sphinx, how she cruelly devoured the people, and that he
who should deliver them from her should have the kingdom.
So       dipus, being very bold, and also ready of wit, went forth
to meet the monster. And when she saw him she spake,
saying:


       Read me this riddle right, or die:
What liveth there beneath the sky,
Four-footed creature that doth choose
Now three feet and now twain to use,
And still more feebly o'er the plain
Walketh with three feet than with twain?       


And       dipus made reply:


       'Tis man, who in life's early day
Four-footed crawleth on his way;
When time hath made his strength complete,
Upright his form and twain his feet;
When age hath bound him to the ground
A third foot in his staff is found.       


[Pg 117]
And when the Sphinx found that her riddle was answered
she cast herself from a high rock and perished.

As a reward       dipus received the great kingdom of Thebes
and the hand of the widowed queen Jocasta in marriage.
Four children were born to them       two sons, Eteocles and
Polynices, and two daughters, Antigone and Ismen        .

Now the gods had decreed that       dipus should murder his
own father and marry his own mother, and by a curious
chance this was precisely what he had done. As a baby he
had been left to die lest he should live to fulfil the doom, but
had been rescued by an old shepherd and brought up at the
court of Corinth. Fleeing from there that he might not
murder him whom he believed to be his father, he had come
to Thebes, and on the way had met Laius, his true father,
the king, and killed him.

While he remained ignorant of the facts       dipus was very
happy and reigned in great power and glory; but when
pestilence fell upon the land and he discovered the truth of
the almost forgotten oracle, he was very miserable, and in the
madness of grief put out his own eyes.

ANTIGONE. A FAITHFUL DAUGHTER
AND SISTER
[Pg 118]

Jocasta, when she learned that       dipus was really her son,
was so filled with horror and distress that she took her own
life. But Antigone and Ismen         were sorry for their father,
whom they loved very dearly, and sought by every means
they knew to render his suffering less.

Longing to see again the land of Corinth which he had left
seized the blind       dipus, and like a beggar, staff in hand, he
set out. Only Antigone accompanied him, guiding his step
and striving daily to keep up his courage.

After much wandering       dipus was finally cast into
prison. Then the two sons took possession of the kingdom,
making agreement between themselves that each should
reign for the space of one year. And the elder of the two,
whose name was Eteocles, first had the kingdom; but when
his year was come to an end, he would not abide by his promise,
but kept that which he should have given up, and drove out
his younger brother from the city. Then the younger, whose
name was Polynices, fled to Argos, to King Adrastus. And
after a while he married the daughter of the king, who made a
covenant with him that he would bring him back with a high
hand to Thebes and set him on the throne of his father. Then
the king sent messengers to certain of the princes of Greece,
entreating that they would help in this matter. And of these
some would not, but others hearkened to his words, so that a
great army was gathered together and followed the king and
Polynices to make war against Thebes. So they came and
pitched their camp over against the city. And after they had[Pg 119]
been there many days, the battle grew fierce about the wall.
But the chiefest fight was between the two brothers, for the
two came together in an open space before the gates. And
first Polynices prayed to Her        , for she was the goddess of
the great city of Argos, which had helped him in this enterprise,
and Eteocles prayed to Pallas of the Golden Shield, whose
temple stood hard by. Then they crouched, each covered
with his shield and holding his spear in his hand, if by chance
his enemy should give occasion to smite him; and if one showed
so much as an eye above the rim of his shield the other would
strike at him. But after a while King Eteocles slipped upon a
stone that was under his foot, and uncovered his leg, at which
straightway Polynices took aim with his spear, piercing the
skin. But so doing he laid his own shoulder bare, and King
Eteocles gave him a wound in the breast. He brake his spear
in striking and would have fared ill but that with a great
stone he smote the spear of Polynices and brake this also in
the middle. And now were the two equal, for each had lost
his spear. So they drew their swords and came yet closer
together. But Eteocles used a device which he had learnt
in the land of Thessaly; for he drew his left foot back, as if he
would have ceased from the battle, and then of a sudden
moved the right forward; and so smiting sideways, drove
his sword right through the body of Polynices. But when,
thinking that he had slain him, he set his weapons in the
earth and began to spoil him of his arms, the other, for he
yet breathed a little, laid his hand upon his sword, and though
he had scarce strength to smite, yet gave the king a mortal
blow, so that the two lay dead together on the plain. And
the men of Thebes lifted up the bodies of the dead and bare
them both into the city.

When these two brothers, the sons of King       dipus, had
fallen each by the hand of the other, the kingdom fell to[Pg 120]
Creon, their uncle. For not only was he the next of kin to the
dead, but also the people held him in great honor because his
son Men      ceus had offered himself with a willing heart that
he might deliver his city from captivity.

Now when Creon was come to the throne he made a proclamation
about the two princes, commanding that they should
bury Eteocles with all honor, seeing that he died as beseemed
a good man and a brave, doing battle for his country, that it
should not be delivered into the hands of the enemy; but as
for Polynices, he bade them leave his body to be devoured
by the fowls of the air and the beasts of the field, because he
had joined himself to the enemy and would have beaten down
the walls of the city and burned the temples of the gods
with fire and led the people captive. Also he commanded
that if any man should break this decree he should suffer
death by stoning.

Now Antigone, who was sister to the two princes, heard
that the decree had gone forth, and chancing to meet her
sister Ismen         before the gates of the palace, spake to her,
saying:

       O my sister, hast thou heard this decree that the king
hath put forth concerning our brethren that are dead?       

Then Ismen         made answer:        I have heard nothing, my
sister, only that we are bereaved of both of our brethren in
one day and that the army of the Argives is departed in this
night that is now past. So much I know, but no more.       

       Hearken then. King Creon hath made a proclamation
that they shall bury Eteocles with all honor, but that Polynices
shall lie unburied, that the birds of the air and the beasts of
the field may devour him, and that whosoever shall break
this decree shall suffer death by stoning.       

       But if it be so, my sister, how can we avail to change it?       

       Think whether or no thou wilt share with me the doing
of this deed.       

[Pg 121]       What deed? What meanest thou?       

       To pay due honor to this dead body.       

       What? Wilt thou bury him when the king hath forbidden
it?       

       Yes, for he is my brother and also thine, though perchance
thou wouldst not have it so. And I will not play him false.       

       O my sister, wilt thou do this when Creon hath forbidden
it?       

       Why should he stand between me and mine?       

       But think now what sorrows are come upon our house.
For our father perished miserably, having first put out his
own eyes; and our mother hanged herself with her own hands;
our two brothers fell in one day, each by the other's spear;
and now we two only are left. And shall we not fall into a
worse destruction than any, if we transgress these commands
of the king? Think, too, that we are women and not men,
and of necessity obey them that are stronger. Wherefore, as
for me, I will pray the dead to pardon me, seeing that I am
thus constrained; but I will obey them that rule.       

       I advise thee not, and if thou thinkest thus, I would not
have thee for helper. But know that I will bury my brother,
nor could I better die than for doing such a deed. For as he
loved me, so also do I love him greatly. And shall not I do
pleasure to the dead rather than to the living, seeing that I
shall abide with the dead for ever? But thou, if thou wilt
do dishonor to the laws of the gods?       

       I dishonor them not. Only I cannot set myself against
the powers that be.       

       So be it; but I will bury my brother.       

       O my sister, how I fear for thee!       

       Fear for thyself. Thine own lot needeth all thy care.       

       Thou wilt at least keep thy counsel, nor tell the thing to
any man.       

[Pg 122]       Not so: hide it not. I shall scorn thee more if thou proclaim
it not aloud to all.       

So Antigone departed; and after a while came to the same
place King Creon, clad in his royal robes and with his scepter
in his hand, and set forth his counsel to the elders who were
assembled, how he had dealt with the two princes according
to their deserving, giving all honor to him that loved his
country and casting forth the other unburied. And he bade
them take care that this decree should be kept, saying that he
had also appointed certain men to watch the dead body.

And he had scarcely left speaking when there came one of
these same watchers, and said:

       I have not come hither in haste, O King; nay, I doubted
much, while I was yet on the way, whether I should not turn
again. For now I thought, 'Fool, why goest thou where thou
shalt suffer for it'; and then, again, 'Fool, the king will hear
the matter elsewhere, and then how wilt thou fare?' But at
the last I came as I had purposed, for I know that nothing
may happen to me contrary to fate.       

       But say,        said the king,        what troubles thee so much?       

       First hear my case. I did not the thing and know not
who did it, and it were a grievous wrong should I fall into
trouble for such a cause.       

       Thou makest a long preface, excusing thyself, but yet
hast, as I judge, something to tell.       

       Fear, my lord, ever causeth delay.       

       Wilt thou not speak out thy news and then begone?       

       I will speak it. Know then that some man hath thrown
dust upon this dead corpse, and done besides such things as
are needful.       

       What sayest thou? Who hath dared to do this deed?       

       That I know not, for there was no mark as of spade or
pick-axe; nor was the earth broken, nor had wagon passed[Pg 123]
thereon. We were sore dismayed when the watchman showed
the thing to us; for the body we could not see. Buried
indeed it was not, but rather covered with dust. Nor was
there any sign as of wild beast or of dog that had torn it.
Then there arose a contention among us, each blaming the
other, and accusing his fellows, and himself denying that he
had done the deed or was privy to it. And doubtless we had
fallen to blows but that one spake a word which made us all
tremble for fear, knowing that it must be as he said. For he
said that the thing must be told to thee, and in no wise hidden.
So we drew lots, and by evil chance the lot fell upon me.
Wherefore I am here, not willingly, for no man loveth him
that bringeth evil tidings.       

Then said the chief of the old men:

       Consider, O King, for haply this thing is from the gods.       

But the king cried:

       Thinkest thou that the gods care for such an one as this
dead man, who would have burnt their temples with fire, and
laid waste the land which they love; and set at naught the
laws? Not so. But there are men in this city who have long
time had ill will to me, not bowing their necks to my yoke;
and they have persuaded these fellows with money to do this
thing. Surely there never was so evil a thing as money,
which maketh cities into ruinous heaps and banisheth men
from their houses and turneth their thoughts from good unto
evil. But as for them that have done this deed for hire, of a
truth they shall not escape, for I say to thee, fellow, if ye bring
not here before my eyes the man that did this thing, I will
hang you up alive. So shall ye learn that ill gains bring no
profit to a man.       

So the guard departed, but as he went he said to himself:

       Now may the gods grant that the man be found; but
however this may be, thou shalt not see me come again on[Pg 124]
such errand as this, for even now have I escaped beyond all
hope.       

Notwithstanding, after a space he came back with one of
his fellows; and they brought with them the maiden Antigone,
with her hands bound together.

And it chanced that at the same time King Creon came
forth from the palace. Then the guard set forth the thing to
him, saying:

       We cleared away the dust from the dead body, and sat
watching it. And when it was now noon, and the sun was
at his height, there came a whirlwind over the plain, driving
a great cloud of dust. And when this had passed, we looked,
and lo! this maiden whom we have brought hither stood by
the dead corpse. And when she saw that it lay bare as before,
she sent up an exceeding bitter cry, even as a bird whose young
ones have been taken from the nest. Then she cursed them
that had done this deed, and brought dust and sprinkled it
upon the dead man, and poured water upon him three times.
Then we ran and laid hold upon her and accused her that she
had done this deed; and she denied it not. But as for me,
'tis well to have escaped from death, but it is ill to bring
friends into the same. Yet I hold that there is nothing dearer
to a man than his life.       

Then said the king to Antigone:

       Tell me in a word, didst thou know my decree?       

       I knew it. Was it not plainly declared?       

       How daredst thou to transgress the laws?       

       Zeus made not such laws, nor Justice that dwelleth with
the gods below. I judged not that thy decrees had such
authority that a man should transgress for them the unwritten
sure commandments of the gods. For these, indeed, are not
of today or yesterday, but they live forever, and their beginning
no man knoweth. Should I, for fear of thee, be found guilty[Pg 125]
against them? That I should die I knew. Why not? All
men must die. And if I die before my time, what loss? He
who liveth among many sorrows even as I have lived, counteth
it gain to die. But had I left my own mother's son unburied,
this had been loss indeed.       

Then said the king:

       Such stubborn thoughts have a speedy fall and are shivered
even as the iron that hath been made hard in the furnace.
And as for this woman and her sister       for I judge her sister
to have had a part in this matter       though they were nearer
to me than all my kindred, yet shall they not escape the doom
of death. Wherefore let some one bring the other woman
hither.       

And while they went to fetch the maiden Ismen        , Antigone
said to the king:

       Is it not enough for thee to slay me? What need to
say more? For thy words please me not, nor mine thee.
Yet what nobler thing could I have done than to bury my
mother's son? And so would all men say, but fear shutteth
their mouths.       

       Nay,        said the king,        none of the children of Cadmus
thinketh thus, but thou only. But, hold, was not he that fell
in battle with this man thy brother also?       

       Yes, truly, my brother he was.       

       And dost thou not dishonor him when thou honorest his
enemy?       

       The dead man would not say it, could he speak.       

       Shall then the wicked have like honor with the good?       

       How knowest thou but that such honor pleaseth the gods
below?       

       I have no love for them I hate, though they be dead.       

       Of hating I know nothing; 'tis enough for me to love.       

       If thou wilt love, go love the dead. But while I live no
woman shall rule me.       

[Pg 126]Then those that had been sent to fetch the maiden Ismen        
brought her forth from the palace. And when the king accused
her that she had been privy to the deed she denied not, but
would have shared one lot with her sister.

But Antigone turned from her, saying:

       Not so; thou hast no part or lot in the matter. For thou
hast chosen life and I have chosen death; and even so shall
it be.       

And when Ismen         saw that she prevailed nothing with her
sister, she turned to the king and said:

       Wilt thou slay the bride of thy son?       

       Ay,        said he,        there are other brides to win!       

       But none,        she made reply,        that accord so well with
him.       

       I will have no evil wives for my sons,        said the king.

Then cried Antigone:

       O H       mon, whom I love, how thy father wrongeth thee!       

Then the king bade the guards lead the two into the palace.
But scarcely had they gone when there came to the place
the Prince H       mon, the king's son, who was betrothed to the
maiden Antigone. And when the king saw him, he said:

       Art thou content, my son, with thy father's judgment?       

And the young man answered:

       My father, I would follow thy counsels in all things.       

Then said the king:

       'Tis well spoken, my son. This is a thing to be desired,
that a man should have obedient children. But if it be otherwise
with a man, he hath gotten great trouble for himself and
maketh sport for them that hate him. And now as to this
matter. There is naught worse than an evil wife. Wherefore
I say let this damsel wed a bridegroom among the dead. For
since I have found her, alone of all this people, breaking my
decree, surely she shall die. Nor shall it profit her to claim[Pg 127]
kinship with me, for he that would rule a city must first deal
justly with his own kindred. And as for obedience, this it is
that maketh a city to stand both in peace and in war.       

To this the Prince H       mon made answer:

       What thou sayest, my father, I do not judge. Yet bethink
thee, that I see and hear on thy behalf what is hidden from
thee. For common men cannot abide thy look if they say
that which pleaseth thee not. Yet do I hear it in secret.
Know then that all the city mourneth for this maiden, saying
that she dieth wrongfully for a very noble deed, in that she
buried her brother. And 'tis well, my father, not to be wholly
set on thy thoughts, but to listen to the counsels of others.       

       Nay,        said the king;        shall I be taught by such an one
as thou?       

       I pray thee regard my words, if they be well, and not my
years.       

       Can it be well to honor them that transgress? And hath
not this woman transgressed?       

       The people of this city judge not so.       

       The people, sayest thou? Is it for them to rule, or for
me?       

       No city is the possession of one man only.       

So the two answered one the other, and their anger waxed
hot. And at the last the king cried:

       Bring this accursed woman and slay her before his eyes.       

And the prince answered:

       That thou shalt never do. And know this also, that thou
shalt never see my face again.       

So he went away in a rage; and the old men would have
appeased the king's wrath, but he would not hearken to them,
but said that the two maidens should die.

       Wilt thou then slay them both?        said the old men.

       'Tis well said,        the king made answer.        Her that meddled
not with the matter, I harm not.       

[Pg 128]       And how wilt thou deal with the other?       

       There is a desolate place, and there I will shut her up alive
in a sepulchre; yet giving her so much of food as shall quit us
of guilt in the matter, for I would not have the city defiled.
There let her persuade Death, whom she loveth so much, that
he harm her not.       

So the guards led Antigone away to shut her up alive in the
sepulchre. But scarcely had they departed when there came
an old prophet Tiresias, seeking the king. Blind he was, so
that a boy led him by the hand; but the gods had given him
to see things to come.

And when the king saw him he asked:

       What seekest thou, wisest of men?       

Then the prophet answered:

       Hearken, O King, and I will tell thee. I sat in my seat,
after my custom, in the place whither all manner of birds
resort. And as I sat I heard a cry of birds that I knew not,
very strange and full of wrath. And I knew that they tare
and slew each other, for I heard the fierce flapping of their
wings. And being afraid, I made inquiry about the fire,
how it burned upon the altars. And this boy, for as I am a
guide to others so he guideth me, told me that it shone not at
all, but smouldered and was dull, and that the flesh which was
burnt upon the altar spluttered in the flame and wasted away
into corruption and filthiness. And now I tell thee, O King,
that the city is troubled by thy ill counsels. For the dogs
and the birds of the air tear the flesh of this dead son of       dipus,
whom thou sufferest not to have due burial, and carry it to
the altars, polluting them therewith. Wherefore the gods
receive not from us prayer or sacrifice, and the cry of the birds
hath an evil sound, for they are full of the flesh of a man.
Therefore I bid thee be wise in time. For all men may err;
but he that keepeth not his folly, but repenteth, doeth well;
but stubbornness cometh to great trouble.       

[Pg 129]Then the king answered:

       Old man, I know the race of prophets full well, how ye
sell your art for gold. But make thy trade as thou wilt, this
man shall not have burial; yea, though the eagles of Zeus
carry his flesh to their master's throne in heaven, he shall not
have it.       

And when the prophet spake again, entreating him and
warning, the king answered him after the same fashion, that
he spake not honestly, but had sold his art for money.

But at the last the prophet spake in great wrath, saying:

       Know, O King, that before many days shall pass thou shalt
pay a life for a life, even one of thine own children, for them
with whom thou hast dealt unrighteously, shutting up the
living with the dead and keeping the dead from them to whom
they belong. Therefore the Furies lie in wait for thee and
thou shalt see whether or no I speak these things for money.
For there shall be mourning and lamentation in thine own
house, and against thy people shall be stirred up many cities.
And now, my child, lead me home and let this man rage
against them that are younger than I.       

So the prophet departed and the old men were sore afraid
and said:

       He hath spoken terrible things, O King; nor ever since
these gray hairs were black have we known him say that which
was false.       

       Even so,        said the king,        and I am troubled in heart and
yet am loath to depart from my purpose.       

       King Creon,        said the old men,        thou needest good
counsel.       

       What, then, would ye have done?       

       Set free the maiden from the sepulchre and give this
dead man burial.       

Then the king cried to his people that they should bring[Pg 130]
bars wherewith to loosen the doors of the sepulchre, and
hastened with them to the place. But coming on their way
to the body of Prince Polynices, they took it up and washed it,
and buried that which remained of it, and raised over the
ashes a great mound of earth. And this being done, they drew
near to the place of the sepulchre; and as they approached, the
king heard within a very piteous voice, and knew it for the
voice of his son. Then he bade his attendants loose the door
with all speed; and when they had loosed it, they beheld
within a very piteous sight. For the maiden Antigone had
hanged herself by the girdle of linen which she wore, and the
young man Prince H       mon stood with his arms about her dead
body, embracing it. And when the king saw him, he cried
to him to come forth; but the prince glared fiercely upon
him and answered him not a word, but drew his two-edged
sword. Then the king, thinking that his son was minded in
his madness to slay him, leapt back, but the prince drove the
sword into his own heart and fell forward on the earth, still
holding the dead maiden in his arms. And when they brought
the tidings of these things to Queen Eurydice, the wife of
King Creon and mother to the prince, she could not endure
the grief, being thus bereaved of her children, but laid hold of
a sword and slew herself therewith.

So the house of King Creon was left desolate unto him that
day, because he despised the ordinances of the gods.

THE STORY OF IPHIGENIA
[Pg 131]

King Agamemnon sat in his tent at Aulis, where the army
of the Greeks was gathered together, being about to sail
against the great city of Troy. And it was now past midnight;
but the king slept not, for he was careful and troubled about
many things. And he had a lamp before him and in his hand
a tablet of pine wood, whereon he wrote. But he seemed
not to remain in the same mind about that which he wrote;
for now he would blot out the letters, and then would write
them again; and now he fastened the seal upon the tablet
and then brake it. And as he did this he wept and was like to
a man distracted. But after a while he called to an old man,
his attendant (the man had been given in time past by Tyndareus
to his daughter, Queen Clyt       mnestra) and said:

       Old man, thou knowest how Calchas the soothsayer bade
me offer for a sacrifice to Artemis, who is goddess of this place,
my daughter Iphigenia, saying that so only should the army
have a prosperous voyage from this place to Troy, and should
take the city and destroy it; and how when I heard these
words I bade Talthybius the herald go throughout the army
and bid them depart, every man to his own country, for that
I would not do this thing; and how my brother, King Menela      s,
persuaded me so that I consented to it. Now, therefore,
hearken to this, for what I am about to tell thee three men only
know, namely, Calchas the soothsayer, and Menela      s, and
Ulysses, king of Ithaca. I wrote a letter to my wife the
queen, that she should send her daughter to this place, that
she might be married to King Achilles; and I magnified the
man to her, saying that he would in no wise sail with us unless[Pg 132]
I would give him my daughter in marriage. But now I have
changed my purpose and have written another letter after
this fashion, as I will now set forth to thee: 'Daughter of Leda,
send not thy child to the land of Eub      a, for I will give her in
marriage at another time.'       

       Aye,        said the old man,        but how wilt thou deal with
King Achilles? Will he not be wroth, hearing that he hath
been cheated of his wife?       

       Not so,        answered the king,        for we have indeed used
his name, but he knoweth nothing of this marriage. And now
make haste. Sit not thou down by any fountain in the woods,
and suffer not thine eyes to sleep. And beware lest the chariot
bearing the queen and her daughter pass thee where the roads
divide. And see that thou keep the seal upon this letter
unbroken.       

So the old man departed with the letter. But scarcely
had he left the tent when King Menela      s spied him and laid
hands on him, taking the letter and breaking the seal. And
the old man cried out:

       Help, my lord; here is one hath taken thy letter!       

Then King Agamemnon came forth from his tent, saying,
       What meaneth this uproar and disputing that I hear?       

And Menela      s answered,        Seest thou this letter that I
hold in my hand?       

       I see it: it is mine. Give it to me.       

       I give it not till I have read that which is written therein
to all the army of the Greeks.       

       Where didst thou find it?       

       I found it while I waited for thy daughter till she should
come to the camp.       

       What hast thou to do with that? May I not rule my own
household?       

Then Menela      s reproached his brother because he did not[Pg 133]
continue in one mind.        For first,        he said,        before thou
wast chosen captain of the host, thou wast all things to all
men, greeting every man courteously, and taking him by the
hand, and talking with him, and leaving thy doors open to
any that would enter; but afterwards, being now chosen,
thou wast haughty and hard of access. And next, when this
trouble came upon the army, and thou wast sore afraid lest
thou shouldst lose thy office and so miss renown, didst thou
not hearken to Calchas the soothsayer, and promise thy
daughter for sacrifice, and send for her to the camp, making
pretence of giving her in marriage to Achilles? And now thou
art gone back from thy word. Surely this is an evil day for
Greece, that is troubled because thou wantest wisdom.       

Then answered King Agamemnon:        What is thy quarrel
with me? Why blamest thou me if thou couldst not rule thy
wife? And now to win back this woman, because forsooth
she is fair, thou castest aside both reason and honor. And I,
if I had an ill purpose and now have changed it for that which
is wiser, dost thou charge me with folly? Let them that
sware the oath to Tyndareus go with thee on this errand.
Why should I slay my child and work for myself sorrow and
remorse without end that thou mayest have vengeance for
thy wicked wife?       

Then Menela      s turned away in a rage, crying,        Betray me
if thou wilt. I will betake myself to other counsels and other
friends.       

But even as he spake there came a messenger, saying,
       King Agamemnon, I am come, as thou badest me, with thy
daughter Iphigenia. Also her mother, Queen Clyt       mnestra,
is come, bringing with her her little son Orestes. And now
they are resting themselves and their horses by the side of a
spring, for indeed the way is long and weary. And all the
army is gathered about them to see them and greet them.[Pg 134]
And men question much wherefore they are come, saying
'Doth the king make a marriage for his daughter; or hath he
sent for her, desiring to see her?' But I know thy purpose,
my lord; wherefore we will dance and shout and make merry,
for this is a happy day for the maiden.       

But the King Agamemnon was sore dismayed when he knew
that the queen was come, and spake to himself,        Now what
shall I say to my wife? For that she is rightly come to the
marriage of her daughter, who can deny? But what will she
say when she knoweth my purpose? And of the maiden, what
shall I say? Unhappy maiden whose bridegroom shall be
death! For she will cry to me, 'Wilt thou kill me, my father?'
And the little Orestes will wail, not knowing what he doeth,
seeing he is but a babe. Cursed be Paris, who hath wrought
this woe!       

And now King Menela      s came back, saying that it repented
him of what he had said,        For why should thy child die for
me? What hath she to do with Helen? Let the army be
scattered, so that this wrong be not done.       

Then said King Agamemnon,        But how shall I escape from
this strait? For the whole host will compel me to this deed?       

       Not so,        said King Menela      s,        if thou wilt send back the
maiden to Argos.       

       But what shall that profit,        said the king;        for Calchas
will cause the matter to be known, or Ulysses, saying that I
have failed of my promise; and if I fly to Argos, they will
come and destroy my city and lay waste my land. Woe is
me! in what a strait am I set! But take thou care, my brother,
that Clyt       mnestra hear nothing of these things.       

And when he had ended speaking, the queen herself came
unto the tent, riding in a chariot, having her daughter by her
side. And she bade one of the attendants take out with care
the caskets which she had brought for her daughter, and bade[Pg 135]
others help her daughter to alight and herself also, and to a
fourth she said that he should take the young Orestes. Then
Iphigenia greeted her father, saying,        Thou hast done well to
send for me, my father.       

       'Tis true and yet not true, my child.       

       Thou lookest not well pleased to see me, my father.       

       He that is a king and commandeth a host hath many
cares.       

       Put away thy cares awhile and give thyself to me.       

       I am glad beyond measure to see thee.       

       Glad art thou? Then why dost thou weep?       

       I weep because thou must be long time absent from me.       

       Perish all these fightings and troubles!       

       They will cause many to perish, and me most miserably
of all.       

       Art thou going a journey from me, my father?       

       Aye, and thou also hast a journey to make.       

       Must I make it alone, or with my mother?       

       Alone; neither father nor mother may be with thee.       

       Sendest thou me to dwell elsewhere?       

       Hold thy peace: such things are not for maidens to
inquire.       

       Well, my father, order matters with the Phrygians and
then make haste to return.       

       I must first make a sacrifice to the gods.       

       'Tis well. The gods should have due honor.       

       Aye, and thou wilt stand close to the altar.       

       Shall I lead the dances, my father?       

       O my child, how I envy thee, that thou knowest naught!
And now go into the tent; but first kiss me and give me thy
hand, for thou shalt be parted from thy father for many
days.       

And when she was gone within, he cried,        O fair bosom and[Pg 136]
very lovely cheeks and yellow hair of my child! O city of Priam,
what woe thou bringest on me! But I must say no more.       

Then he turned to the queen and excused himself that he
wept when he should rather have rejoiced for the marriage
of his daughter. And when the queen would know of the
estate of the bridegroom he told her that his name was Achilles
and that he was the son of Peleus by his wife Thetis, the
daughter of Nereus of the sea, and that he dwelt in Phthia.
And when she inquired of the time of the marriage, he said
that it should be in the same moon, on the first lucky day;
and as to the place, that it must be where the bridegroom was
sojourning, that is to say, in the camp.        And I,        said the
king,        will give the maiden to her husband.       

       But where,        answered the queen,        is it your pleasure that
I should be?       

       Thou must return to Argos and care for the maidens
there.       

       Sayest thou that I must return? Who then will hold up
the torch for the bride?       

       I will do that which is needful. For it is not seemly that
thou shouldst be present where the whole army is gathered
together.       

       Aye, but it is seemly that a mother should give her daughter
in marriage.       

       But the maidens at home should not be left alone.       

       They are well kept in their chambers.       

       Be persuaded, lady.       

       Not so: thou shalt order that which is without the house,
but I that which is within.       

But now came Achilles to tell the king that the army was
growing impatient, saying that unless they might sail speedily
to Troy they would return each man to his home. And
when the queen heard his name       for he had said to the attend[Pg 137]ant,
       Tell thy master that Achilles, the son of Peleus, would
speak with hi.              she came forth from the tent and greeted
him and bade him give her his right hand. And when the
young man was ashamed (for it was not counted a seemly
thing that men should speak with women) she said:

       But why art thou ashamed, seeing that thou art about to
marry my daughter?       

And he answered,        What sayest thou, lady? I cannot
speak for wonder at thy words.       

       Often men are ashamed when they see new friends and the
talk is of marriage.       

       But, lady, I never was suitor for thy daughter. Nor
have the sons of Atreus said aught to me of the matter.       

But the queen was beyond measure astonished, and cried,
       Now this is shameful indeed, that I should seek a bridegroom
for my daughter in such fashion.       

But when Achilles would have departed, to inquire of the
king what this thing might mean, the old man that had at
the first carried the letter came forth and bade him stay.
And when he had assurance that he should receive no harm
for what he should tell them, he unfolded the whole matter.
And when the queen had heard it, she cried to Achilles,        O
son of Thetis of the sea! help me now in this strait and help
this maiden that hath been called thy bride, though this
indeed be false. 'Twill be a shame to thee if such wrong be
done under thy name; for it is thy name that hath undone
us. Nor have I any altar to which I may flee, nor any friend
but thee only in this army.       

Then Achilles made answer,        Lady, I learnt from Chiron,
who was the most righteous of men, to be true and honest.
And if the sons of Atreus govern according to right, I obey
them; and if not, not. Know, then, that thy daughter,
seeing that she hath been given, though but in word only, to[Pg 138]
me, shall not be slain by her father. For if she so die, then
shall my name be brought to great dishonor, seeing that
through it thou hast been persuaded to come with her to this
place. This sword shall see right soon whether any one
will dare to take this maiden from me.       

And now King Agamemnon came forth, saying that all
things were ready for the marriage, and that they waited for
the maiden, not knowing that the whole matter had been
revealed to the queen. Then she said:

       Tell me now, dost thou purpose to slay thy daughter and
mine?        And when he was silent, not knowing, indeed,
what to say, she reproached him with many words, that she
had been a loving and faithful wife to him, for which he made
her an ill recompense slaying her child.

And when she had made an end of speaking, the maiden
came forth from the tent, holding the young child Orestes
in her arms, and cast herself upon her knees before her father
and besought him, saying,        I would, my father, that I had
the voice of Orpheus, who made even the rocks to follow
him, that I might persuade thee; but now all that I have I
give, even these tears. O my father, I am thy child; slay me
not before my time. This light is sweet to look upon. Drive
me not from it to the land of darkness. I was the first to call
thee father; and the first to whom thou didst say 'my child.'
And thou wouldst say to me, 'Some day, my child, I shall see
thee a happy wife in the home of a good husband.' And I
would answer, 'And I will receive thee with all love when thou
art old, and pay thee back for all the benefits thou hast done
unto me,' This I indeed remember, but thou forgettest; for
thou art ready to slay me. Do it not, I beseech thee, by Pelops
thy grandsire, and Atreus thy father, and this my mother,
who travailed in childbirth of me and now travaileth again
in her sorrow. And thou, O my brother, though thou art but[Pg 139]
a babe, help me. Weep with me; beseech thy father that he
slay not thy sister. O my father, though he be silent, yet,
indeed, he beseecheth thee. For his sake, therefore, yea,
and for mine own, have pity upon me and slay me not.       

But the king was sore distracted; knowing not what he should
say or do, for a terrible necessity was upon him, seeing that the
army could not make their journey to Troy unless this deed
should first be done. And while he doubted came Achilles,
saying that there was a horrible tumult in the camp, the men
crying out that the maiden must be sacrificed, and that when
he would have stayed them from their purpose, the people
had stoned him with stones, and that his own Myrmidons
helped him not, but rather were the first to assail him. Nevertheless,
he said that he would fight for the maiden, even to the
utmost, and that there were faithful men who would stand
with him and help him. But when the maiden heard these
words, she stood forth and said,        Hearken to me, my mother.
Be not wroth with my father, for we cannot fight against
fate. Also we must take thought that this young man suffer
not, for his help will avail naught and he himself will perish.
Therefore I am resolved to die; for all Greece looketh to me;
for without me the ships cannot make their voyage, nor the
city of Troy be taken. Thou didst bear me, my mother, not
for thyself only, but for this whole people. Wherefore I will
give myself for them. Offer me for an offering, and let the
Greeks take the city of Troy, for this shall be my memorial
forever.       

Then said Achilles,        Lady, I should count myself most
happy if the gods would grant thee to be my wife. For I
love thee well when I see how noble thou art. And if thou
wilt, I will carry thee to my home. And I doubt not that
I shall save thee, though all the men of Greece be against me.       

But the maiden answered,        What I say, I say with full[Pg 140]
purpose. Nor will I that any man should die for me, but
rather will I save this land of Greece.       

And Achilles said,        If this be thy will, lady, I cannot say
nay, for it is a noble thing that thou doest.       

Nor was the maiden turned from her purpose though her
mother besought her with many tears. So they that were
appointed led her to the grove of Artemis, where there was
built an altar, and the whole army of the Greeks gathered
about it. But when the king saw her going to her death he
covered his face with his mantle; but she stood by him, and
said,        I give my body with a willing heart to die for my country
and for the whole land of Greece. I pray the gods that ye
may prosper and win the victory in this war and come back
safe to your homes. And now let no man touch me, for I
will die with a good heart.       

And all men marveled to see the maiden of what a good
courage she was. And all the army stood regarding the
maiden and the priest and the altar.

Then there befell a marvelous thing. For suddenly
the maiden was not there. Whither she had gone no one
knew; but in her stead there lay gasping a great hind, and
all the altar was red with the blood thereof.

And Calchas said,        See ye this, men of Greece, how the
goddess hath provided this offering in the place of the maiden,
for she would not that her altar should be defiled with innocent
blood. Be of good courage, therefore, and depart every man
to his ship, for this day ye shall sail across the sea to the land
of Troy.       

Then the goddess carried away the maiden to the land of
the Taurians, where she had a temple and an altar. Now
on this altar the king of the land was wont to sacrifice any
stranger, being Greek by nation, who was driven by stress of
weather to the place, for none went thither willingly. And[Pg 141]
the name of the king was Thoas, which signifieth in the Greek
tongue,        swift of foot.       

Now when the maiden had been there many years she
dreamed a dream. And in the dream she seemed to have
departed from the land of the Taurians and to dwell in the
city of Argos, wherein she had been born. And as she slept
in the women's chamber there befell a great earthquake, and
cast to the ground the palace of her fathers, so that there was
left one pillar only which stood upright. And as she looked
on this pillar, yellow hair seemed to grow upon it as the hair
of a man, and it spake with a man's voice. And she did to
it as she was wont to do to the strangers that were sacrificed
upon the altar, purifying it with water and weeping the while.
And the interpretation of the dream she judged to be that her
brother Orestes was dead, for that male children are the pillars
of a house, and that she only was left to the house of her father.

Now it chanced that at this same time Orestes, with Pylades
that was his friend, came in a ship to the land of the Taurians.
And the cause of his coming was this. After that he had slain
his mother, taking vengeance for the death of King Agamemnon
his father, the Furies pursued him. Then Apollo, who
had commanded him to do this deed, bade him go to the land
of Athens that he might be judged. And when he had been
judged and loosed, yet the Furies left him not. Wherefore
Apollo commanded that he should sail for the land of the
Taurians and carry thence the image of Artemis and bring it
to the land of the Athenians, and that after this he should
have rest. Now when the two were come to the place, they
saw the altar that it was red with the blood of them that had
been slain thereon. And Orestes doubted how they might
accomplish the things for the which he was come, for the walls
of the temple were high and the gates not easy to be broken
through. Therefore he would have fled to the ship, but[Pg 142]
Pylades consented not, seeing that they were not wont to go
back from that to which they had set their hand, but counseled
that they should hide themselves during the day in a cave
that was hard by the seashore, not near to the ship, lest search
should be made for them, and that by night they should creep
into the temple by a space that there was between the pillars,
and carry off the image, and so depart.

So they hid themselves in a cavern by the sea. But it
chanced that certain herdsmen were feeding their oxen in
pastures hard by the shore; one of these, coming near to the
cavern, spied the young men as they sat therein, and stealing
back to his fellows, said,        See ye not them that sit yonder.
Surely they are gods;        for they were exceeding tall and fair
to look upon. And some began to pray to them, thinking
that they might be the Twin Brethren or of the sons of Nereus.
But another laughed and said,        Not so; these are shipwrecked
men who hide themselves, knowing that it is our custom to
sacrifice strangers to our gods.        To him the others gave
consent and said that they should take the men prisoners
that they might be sacrificed to the gods.

But while they delayed, Orestes ran forth from the cave,
for the madness was come upon him, crying out,        Pylades,
seest thou not that dragon from hell; and that who would
kill me with the serpents of her mouth, and this again that
breatheth out fire, holding my mother in her arms to cast
her upon me?        And first he bellowed as a bull and then
howled as a dog, for the Furies, he said, did so. But the
herdsmen, when they saw this, gathered together in great
fear and sat down. But when Orestes drew his sword and
leapt, as a lion might leap, into the midst of the herd, slaying
the beasts (for he thought in his madness that he was contending
with the Furies), then the herdsmen, blowing on shells, called
to the people of the land; for they feared the young men, so[Pg 143]
strong they seemed and valiant. And when no small number
was gathered together, they began to cast stones and javelins
at the two. And now the madness of Orestes began to abate,
and Pylades tended him carefully, wiping away the foam from
his mouth and holding his garments before him that he should
not be wounded by the stones. But when Orestes came to
himself and beheld in what straits they were, he groaned aloud
and cried,        We must die, O Pylades, only let us die as befitteth
brave men. Draw thy sword and follow me.        And the people
of the land dared not to stand before them; yet while some
fled, others would cast stones at them. For all that no man
wounded them. But at the last, coming about them with a
great multitude, they smote the swords out of their hands
with stones, and so bound them and took them to King Thoas.
And the king commanded that they should be taken to the
temple, that the priestess might deal with them according
to the custom of the place.

So they brought the young men bound to the temple. Now
the name of the one they knew, for they had heard his companion
call to him, but the name of the other they knew not.
And when Iphigenia saw them, she bade the people loose their
bonds, for that being holy to the goddess they were free.
And then       for she took the two for brothers       she asked
them, saying,        Who is your mother and your father and your
sister, if a sister you have? She will be bereaved of noble
brothers this day. And whence come ye?       

To her Orestes answered,        What meanest thou, lady, by
lamenting in this fashion over us? I hold it folly in him who
must die that he should bemoan himself. Pity us not; we
know what manner of sacrifices ye have in this land.       

       Tell me now, which of ye two is called Pylades?       

       Not I, but this my companion.       

       Of what city in the land of Greece are ye? And are ye
brothers born of one mother?       

[Pg 144]       Brothers we are, but in friendship, not in blood.       

       And what is thy name?       

       That I tell thee not. Thou hast power over my body,
but not over my name.       

       Wilt thou not tell me thy country?       

And when he told her that his country was Argos, she asked
him many things, as about Troy, and Helen, and Calchas the
prophet, and Ulysses; and at last she said,        And Achilles,
son of Thetis of the sea, is he yet alive?       

       He is dead and his marriage that was made at Aulis is of
no effect.       

       A false marriage it was, as some know full well.       

       Who art thou that inquirest thus about matters in Greece?       

       I am of the land of Greece and was brought thence yet
being a child. But there was a certain Agamemnon, son of
Atreus; what of him?       

       I know not. Lady, leave all talk of him.       

       Say not so; but do me a pleasure and tell me.       

       He is dead.       

       Woe is me! How died he?       

       What meaneth thy sorrow? Art thou of his kindred?       

       'Tis a pity to think how great he was, and now he hath
perished.       

       He was slain in a most miserable fashion by a woman,
but ask no more.       

       Only this one thing. Is his wife yet alive?       

       Nay; for the son whom she bare slew her, taking vengeance
for his father.       

       A dreadful deed, but righteous withal.       

       Righteous indeed he is, but the gods love him not.       

       And did the king leave any other child behind him?       

       One daughter, Electra by name.       

       And is his son yet alive?       

[Pg 145]       He is alive, but no man more miserable.       

Now when Iphigenia heard that he was alive and knew
that she had been deceived by the dreams which she had
dreamt; she conceived a thought in her heart and said to
Orestes,        Hearken now, for I have somewhat to say to thee
that shall bring profit both to thee and to me. Wilt thou, if I
save thee from this death, carry tidings of me to Argos to
my friends and bear a tablet from me to them? For such a
tablet I have with me, which one who was brought captive
to this place wrote for me, pitying me, for he knew that I
caused not his death, but the law of the goddess in this place.
Nor have I yet found a man who should carry this thing to
Argos. But thou, I judge, art of noble birth and knowest
the city and those with whom I would have communication.
Take then this tablet and thy life as a reward, and let this
man be sacrificed to the goddess.       

Then Orestes made answer,        Thou hast said well, lady,
save in one thing only. That this man should be sacrificed
in my stead pleaseth me not at all. For I am he that brought
this voyage to pass; and this man came with me that he might
help me in my troubles. Wherefore it would be a grievous
wrong that he should suffer in my stead and I escape. Give
then the tablet to him. He shall take it to the city of Argos
and thou shalt have what thou wilt. But as for me, let them
slay me if they will.       

       'Tis well spoken, young man. Thou art come, I know,
of a noble stock. The gods grant that my brother       for I
have a brother, though he be far hence       may be such as thou.
It shall be as thou wilt. This man shall depart with the tablet
and thou shalt die.       

Then Orestes would know the manner of the death by which
he must die. And she told him that she slew not the victims
with her own hand, but that there were ministers in the[Pg 146]
temple appointed to this office, she preparing them for sacrifice
beforehand. Also she said that his body would be burned
with fire.

And when Orestes had wished that the hand of his sister
might pay due honor to him in his death, she said,        This may
not be, for she is far away from this strange land. But yet,
seeing that thou art a man of Argos, I myself will adorn thy
tomb and pour oil of olives and honey on thy ashes.        Then
she departed, that she might fetch the tablet from her dwelling,
bidding the attendants keep the young men fast, but without
bonds.

But when she was gone, Orestes said to Pylades,        Pylades,
what thinkest thou? Who is this maiden? She had great
knowledge of things in Troy and Argos, and of Calchas the
wise soothsayer, and of Achilles and the rest. And she made
lamentation over King Agamemnon. She must be of Argos.       

And Pylades answered,        This I cannot say; all men have
knowledge of what befell the king. But hearken to this.
It were shame to me to live if thou diest. I sailed with thee
and will die with thee. For otherwise men will account
lightly of me both in Argos and in Phocis, which is my own
land, thinking that I betrayed thee or basely slew thee, that
I might have thy kingdom, marrying thy sister, who shall
inherit it in thy stead. Not so: I will die with thee and my
body shall be burnt together with thine.       

But Orestes answered,        I must bear my own troubles.
This indeed would be a shameful thing, that when thou seekest
to help me I should destroy thee. But as for me, seeing how
the gods deal with me, it is well that I should die. Thou,
indeed, art happy, and thy house is blessed; but my house is
accursed. Go, therefore, and my sister, whom I have given
thee to wife, shall bear thee children, and the house of my
father shall not perish. And I charge thee that when thou art[Pg 147]
safe returned to the city of Argos, thou do these things.
First, thou shalt build a tomb for me, and my sister shall make
an offering there of her hair and of her tears also. And tell
her that I died, slain by a woman of Argos that offered me
as an offering to her gods; and I charge thee that thou leave
not my sister, but be faithful to her. And now farewell, true
friend and companion in my toils; for indeed I die, and
Ph      bus hath lied unto me, prophesying falsely.       

And Pylades swore to him that he would build him a tomb
and be a true husband to his sister. After this Iphigenia
came forth, holding a tablet in her hand. And she said,
       Here is the tablet of which I spake. But I fear lest he to
whom I shall give it shall haply take no account of it when he
is returned to the land. Therefore I would fain bind him with
an oath that he will deliver it to them that should have it in
the city of Argos.        And Orestes consented, saying that she
also should bind herself with an oath that she would deliver
one of the two from death. So she sware by Artemis that
she would persuade the king, and deliver Pylades from death.
And Pylades sware on his part by Zeus, the father of heaven,
that he would give the tablet to those whom it should concern.
And having sworn it, he said,        But what if a storm overtake
me and the tablet be lost and I only be saved?       

       I will tell thee what hath been written in the tablet;
and if it perish, thou shalt tell them again; but if not, then
thou shalt give it as I bid thee.       

       And to whom shall I give it?       

       Thou shalt give it to Orestes, son of Agamemnon. And
that which is written therein is this: 'I that was sacrificed in
Aulis, even Iphigenia, who am alive and yet dead to my own
people, bid thee              '       

But when Orestes heard this, he brake in,        Where is this
Iphigenia? Hath the dead come back among the living?       

[Pg 148]       Thou seest her in me. But interrupt me not. 'I bid thee
fetch me before I die to Argos from a strange land, taking me
from the altar that is red with the blood of strangers, whereat I
serve.' And if Orestes ask by what means I am alive, thou
shalt say that Artemis put a hind in my stead, and that the
priest, thinking that he smote me with the knife, slew the
beast, and that the goddess brought me to this land.       

Then said Pylades,        My oath is easy to keep. Orestes,
take thou this tablet from thy sister.       

Then Orestes embraced his sister, crying       for she turned
from him, not knowing what she should think-.       O my sister,
turn not from me; for I am thy brother whom thou didst not
think to see.       

And when she yet doubted, he told her of certain things
by which she might know him to be Orestes       how that she
had woven a tapestry wherein was set forth the strife between
Atreus and Thyestes concerning the golden lamb; and that
she had given a lock of her hair at Aulis to be a memorial of
her; and that there was laid in her chamber at Argos the
ancient spear of Pelops, her father's grandsire, with which
he slew       noma      s and won Hippodamia to be his wife.

And when she heard this, she knew that he was indeed
Orestes, whom, being an infant and the latest born of his
mother, she had in time past held in her arms. But when the
two had talked together for a space, rejoicing over each other
and telling the things that had befallen them, Pylades said,
       Greetings of friends after long parting are well; but we must
needs consider how best we shall escape from this land of the
barbarians.       

But Iphigenia answered,        Yet nothing shall hinder me from
knowing how fareth my sister Electra.       

       She is married,        said Orestes,        to this Pylades, whom thou
seest.       

[Pg 149]       And of what country is he and who is his father?       

       His father is Strophius the Phocian; and he is a kinsman,
for his mother was the daughter of Atreus and a friend also
such as none other is to me.       

Then Orestes set forth to his sister the cause of his coming
to the land of the Taurians. And he said,        Now help me in
this, my sister, that we may bear away the image of the
goddess; for so doing I shall be quit of my madness, and
thou wilt be brought to thy native country and the house of
thy father shall prosper. But if we do it not, then shall we
perish altogether.       

And Iphigenia doubted much how this thing might be done.
But at the last she said,        I have a device whereby I shall
compass the matter. I will say that thou art come hither,
having murdered thy mother, and that thou canst not be
offered for a sacrifice till thou art purified with the water of
the sea. Also that thou hast touched the image, and that
this also must be purified in like manner. And the image I
myself will bear to the sea; for, indeed, I only may touch it
with my hands. And of this Pylades also I will say that he
is polluted in like manner with thee. So shall we three win
our way to the ship. And that this be ready it will be thy
care to provide.       

And when she had so said, she prayed to Artemis:        Great
goddess, that didst bring me safe in days past from Aulis,
bring me now also, and these that are with me, safe to the
land of Greece, so that men may count thy brother Apollo
to be a true prophet. Nor shouldst thou be unwilling to
depart from this barbarous land and to dwell in the fair city
of Athens.       

After this came King Thoas, inquiring whether they had
offered the strangers for sacrifice and had duly burnt their
bodies with fire. To him Iphigenia made answer,        These
were unclean sacrifices that thou broughtest to me, O King.       

[Pg 150]       How didst thou learn this?       

       The image of the goddess turned upon her place of her
own accord and covered also her face with her hands.       

       What wickedness, then, had these strangers wrought?       

       They slew their mother and had been banished therefor
from the land of Greece.       

       O monstrous! Such deeds we barbarians never do.
And now what dost thou purpose?       

       We must purify these strangers before we offer them for a
sacrifice.       

       With water from the river, or in the sea?       

       In the sea. The sea cleanseth away all that is evil among
men.       

       Well, thou hast it here, by the very walls of the temple.       

       Aye, but I must seek a place apart from men.       

       So be it; go where thou wilt; I would not look on things
forbidden.       

       The image also must be purified.       

       Surely, if the pollution from these murderers of their
mother hath touched it. This is well thought of in thee.       

Then she instructed the king that he should bring the
strangers out of the temple, having first bound them and veiled
their heads. Also that certain of his guards should go with
her, but that all the people of the city should be straitly
commanded to stay within doors, that so they might not be
defiled; and that he himself should abide in the temple and
purify it with fire, covering his head with his garments when
the strangers should pass by.        And be not troubled,        she
said,        if I seem to be long doing these things.       

       Take what time thou wilt,        he said,        so that thou do all
things in order.       

So certain of the king's guards brought the two young
men from out of the temple, and Iphigenia led them towards[Pg 151]
the place where the ship of Orestes lay at anchor. But when
they were come near to the shore, she bade them halt nor
come over-near, for that she had that to do in which they must
have no part. And she took the chain wherewith the young
men were bound in her hands and set up a strange song as of
one that sought enchantments. And after that the guards
sat where she bade them for a long time, they began to fear
lest the strangers should have slain the priestess and so fled.
Yet they moved not, fearing to see that which was forbidden.
But at the last with one consent they rose up. And when
they were come to the sea, they saw the ship trimmed to set
forth, and fifty sailors on the benches having oars in their
hands ready for rowing; and the two young men were standing
unbound upon the shore near to the stern. And other sailors
were dragging the ship by the cable to the shore that the
young men might embark. Then the guards laid hold of the
rudder and sought to take it from its place, crying,        Who are
ye that carry away priestesses and the images of our gods?       
Then Orestes said,        I am Orestes, and I carry away my sister.       
But the guards laid hold of Iphigenia; and when the sailors
saw this they leapt from the ship; and neither the one nor the
other had swords in their hands, but they fought with their
fists and their feet also. And as the sailors were strong and
skilful, the king's men were driven back sorely bruised and
wounded. And when they fled to a bank that was hard by
and cast stones at the ship, the archers standing on the stern
shot at them with arrows. Then       for his sister feared to
come farther       Orestes leapt into the sea and raised her upon
his shoulder and so lifted her into the ship, and the image of
the goddess with her. And Pylades cried,        Lay hold of your
oars, ye sailors, and smite the sea, for we have that for the
which we came to this land.        So the sailors rowed with all
their might; and while the ship was in the harbor it went well[Pg 152]
with them, but when it was come to the open sea a great
wave took it, for a violent wind blew against it and drove it
backwards to the shore.

And one of the guards when he saw this ran to King Thoas
and told him, and the king made haste and sent messengers
mounted upon horses, to call the men of the land that they
might do battle with Orestes and his comrade. But while
he was yet sending them, there appeared in the air above his
head the goddess Athene, who spake, saying,        Cease, King
Thoas, from pursuing this man and his companions; for he
hath come hither on this errand by the command of Apollo;
and I have persuaded Poseidon that he make the sea smooth
for him to depart.       

And King Thoas answered,        It shall be as thou wilt, O
goddess; and though Orestes hath borne away his sister and
the image, I dismiss my anger, for who can fight against the
gods?       

So Orestes departed and came to his own country and dwelt
in peace, being set free from his madness, according to the
word of Apollo.



Iphigenia about to be sacrificed






The Trojan Horse




Top
THE SACK OF TROY
[Pg 153]

For ten years King Agamemnon and the men of Greece
laid siege to Troy. But though sentence had gone forth
against the city, yet the day of its fall tarried, because certain
of the gods loved it well and defended it, as Apollo and Mars,
the god of war, and Father Jupiter himself. Wherefore
Minerva put it into the heart of Epeius, Lord of the Isles, that
he should make a cunning device wherewith to take the city.
Now the device was this: he made a great horse of wood,
feigning it to be a peace-offering to Minerva, that the Greeks
might have a safe return to their homes. In the belly of this
there hid themselves certain of the bravest of the chiefs, as
Menela      s, and Ulysses, and Thoas the        tolian, and Machaon
the great physician, and Pyrrhus, son of Achilles (but Achilles
himself was dead, slain by Paris, Apollo helping, even as he
was about to take the city), and others also, and with them
Epeius himself. But the rest of the people made as if they had
departed to their homes; only they went not further than
Tenedos, which was an island near to the coast.

Great joy was there in Troy when it was noised abroad
that the men of Greece had departed. The gates were opened,
and the people went forth to see the plain and the camp.
And one said to another as they went,        Here they set the
battle in array, and there were the tents of the fierce Achilles,
and there lay the ships.        And some stood and marveled at
the great peace-offering to Minerva, even the horse of wood.
And Thym      tes, who was one of the elders of the city, was the
first who advised that it should be brought within the walls
and set in the citadel. Now whether he gave this counsel[Pg 154]
out of a false heart or because the gods would have it so, no
man knows. But Capys, and others with him, said that it
should be drowned in water or burned with fire, or that men
should pierce it and see whether there were aught within.
And the people were divided, some crying one thing and some
another. Then came forward the priest Laoco      n, and a
great company with him, crying,        What madness is this?
Think ye that the men of Greece are indeed departed or that
there is any profit in their gifts? Surely there are armed men
in this mighty horse; or haply they have made it that they
may look down upon our walls. Touch it not, for as for these
men of Greece, I fear them, even though they bring gifts in
their hands.       

And as he spake he cast his great spear at the horse, so that
it sounded again. But the gods would not that Troy should
be saved.

Meanwhile there came certain shepherds dragging with
them one whose hands were bound behind his back. He had
come forth to them, they said, of his own accord when they
were in the field. And first the young men gathered about
him mocking him, but when he cried aloud,        What place is
left for me, for the Greeks suffer me not to live and the men
of Troy cry for vengeance upon me?        they rather pitied him,
and bade him speak and say whence he came and what he
had to tell.

Then the man spake, turning to King Priam:        I will speak
the truth, whatever befall me. My name is Sinon and I
deny not that I am a Greek. Haply thou hast heard the
name of Palamedes, whom the Greeks slew, but now, being
dead, lament; and the cause was that because he counseled
peace, men falsely accused him of treason. Now, of this
Palamedes I was a poor kinsman and followed him to Troy.
And when he was dead, through the false witness of Ulysses,[Pg 155]
I lived in great grief and trouble, nor could I hold my peace,
but sware that if ever I came back to Argos I would avenge
me of him that had done this deed. Then did Ulysses seek
occasion against me, whispering evil things, nor rested till
at the last, Calchas the soothsayer helping him       but what
profit it that I should tell these things? For doubtless ye
hold one Greek to be even as another. Wherefore slay me
and doubtless ye will do a pleasure to Ulysses and the sons of
Atreus.       

Then they bade him tell on, and he said:

       Often would the Greeks have fled to their homes, being
weary of the war, but still the stormy sea hindered them.
And when this horse that ye see had been built, most of all
did the dreadful thunder roll from the one end of the heaven
to the other. Then the Greeks sent one who should inquire
of Apollo; and Apollo answered them thus: 'Men of Greece,
even as ye appeased the winds with blood when ye came to
Troy, so must ye appease them with blood now that ye would
go from thence.' Then did men tremble to think on whom
the doom should fall, and Ulysses, with much clamor, drew
forth Calchas the soothsayer into the midst, and bade him
say who it was that the gods would have as a sacrifice. Then
did many forbode evil for me. Ten days did the soothsayer
keep silence, saying that he would not give any man to death.
But then, for in truth the two had planned the matter beforehand,
he spake, appointing me to die. And to this thing they
all agreed, each being glad to turn to another that which he
feared for himself. But when the day was come and all
things were ready, the salted meal for the sacrifice and the
garlands, lo! I burst my bonds and fled and hid myself in the
sedges of a pool, waiting till they should have set sail, if haply
that might be. But never shall I see country or father or
children again. For doubtless on these will they take vengeance[Pg 156]
for my flight. Only do thou, O King, have pity on
me, who have suffered many things, not having harmed any
man.       

And King Priam had pity on him, and bade them loose
his bonds, saying,        Whoever thou art, forget now thy country.
Henceforth thou art one of us. But tell me true: why made
they this huge horse? Who contrived it? What seek they
by it       to please the gods or to further their siege?       

Then said Sinon, and as he spake he stretched his hands
to the sky,        I call you to witness, ye everlasting fires of
heaven, that with good right I now break my oath of fealty and
reveal the secrets of my countrymen. Listen then, O King.
All our hope has ever been in the help of Minerva. But from
the day when Diomede and Ulysses dared, having bloody
hands, to snatch her image from her holy place in Troy, her
face was turned from us. Well do I remember how the eyes
of the image, well-nigh before they had set it in the camp,
blazed with wrath, and how the salt sweat stood upon its
limbs, aye, and how it thrice leapt from the ground, shaking
shield and spear. Then Calchas told us that we must cross
the seas again and seek at home fresh omens for our war.
And this, indeed, they are doing even now, and will return
anon. Also the soothsayer said, 'Meanwhile ye must make
the likeness of a horse, to be a peace-offering to Minerva.
And take heed that ye make it huge of bulk, so that the men of
Troy may not receive it into their gates, nor bring it within
their walls and get safety for themselves thereby. For if,'
he said, 'the men of Troy harm this image at all, they shall
surely perish; but if they bring it into their city, then shall
Asia lay siege hereafter to the city of Pelops, and our children
shall suffer the doom which we would fain have brought on
Troy.'       

These words wrought much on the men of Troy, and as[Pg 157]
they pondered on them, lo! the gods sent another marvel to
deceive them. For while Laoco      n, the priest of Neptune, was
slaying a bull at the altar of his god, there came two serpents
across the sea from Tenedos, whose heads and necks, whereon
were thick manes of hair, were high above the waves, and
many scaly coils trailed behind in the waters. And when
they reached the land they still sped forward. Their eyes
were red as blood and blazed with fire and their forked tongues
hissed loud for rage. Then all the men of Troy grew pale with
fear and fled away, but these turned not aside this way or
that, seeking Laoco      n where he stood. And first they wrapped
themselves about his little sons, one serpent about each, and
began to devour them. And when the father would have
given help to his children, having a sword in his hand, they
seized upon himself and bound him fast with their folds.
Twice they compassed him about his body, and twice about
his neck, lifting their heads far above him. And all the while
he strove to tear them away with his hands, his priest's garlands
dripping with blood. Nor did he cease to cry horribly
aloud, even as a bull bellows when after an ill stroke of the
axe it flees from the altar. But when their work was done,
the two glided to the citadel of Minerva and hid themselves
beneath the feet and the shield of the goddess. And men said
one to another,        Lo! the priest Laoco      n has been judged
according to his deeds; for he cast his spear against this holy
thing, and now the gods have slain him.        Then all cried out
together that the horse of wood must be drawn to the citadel.
Whereupon they opened the Sc       an Gate and pulled down the
wall that was thereby, and put rollers under the feet of the
horse and joined ropes thereto. So in much joy they drew
it into the city, youths and maidens singing about it the while
and laying their hands to the ropes with great gladness. And
yet there wanted no signs and tokens of evil to come. Four[Pg 158]
times it halted on the threshold of the gate, and men might
have heard a clashing of arms within. Cassandra also opened
her mouth, prophesying evil; but no man heeded her, for
that was ever the doom upon her, not to be believed, though
speaking truth. So the men of Troy drew the horse into the
city. And that night they kept a feast to all the gods with
great joy not knowing that the last day of the great city had
come.

But when night was now fully come and the men of Troy
lay asleep, lo! from the ship of King Agamemnon there rose
up a flame for a signal to the Greeks; and these straightway
manned their ships and made across the sea from Tenedos,
there being a great calm and the moon also giving them light.
Sinon likewise opened a secret door that was in the great
horse and the chiefs issued forth therefrom and opened the
gates of the city, slaying those that kept watch.

Meanwhile there came a vision to        neas, who now, Hector
being dead, was the chief hope and stay of the men of Troy.
It was Hector's self that he seemed to see, but not such as he
had seen him coming back rejoicing with the arms of Achilles
or setting fire to the ships, but even as he lay after that Achilles
dragged him at his chariot wheels, covered with dust, and
blood, his feet swollen and pierced through with thongs.
To him said.        neas, not knowing what he said,        Why hast thou
tarried so long? Much have we suffered waiting for thee!
And what grief hath marked thy face, and whence these
wounds?       

But to this the spirit answered nothing, but said, groaning
the while,        Fly, son of Venus, fly and save thee from these
flames. The enemy is in the walls and Troy hath utterly
perished. If any hand could have saved our city, this hand
had done so. Thou art now the hope of Troy. Take then her
gods and flee with them for company, seeking the city that
thou shalt one day build across the sea.       

[Pg 159]And now the alarm of battle came nearer and nearer, and
       neas, waking from sleep, climbed upon the roof and looked
on the city. As a shepherd stands and sees a fierce flame
sweeping before the south wind over the corn-fields or a flood
rushing down from the mountains, so he stood. And as he
looked, the great palace of De      phobus sank down in the fire
and the house of Ucalegon that was hard by, blazed forth, till
the sea by Sige      m shone with the light. Then, scarce knowing
what he sought, he girded on his armor, thinking perchance
that he might yet win some place of vantage or at the least
might avenge himself on the enemy or find honor in his death.
But as he passed from out of his house there met him Panthus,
the priest of Apollo that was on the citadel, who cried to him,
       O        neas, the glory is departed from Troy and the Greeks
have the mastery in the city; for armed men are coming forth
from the great horse of wood and thousands also swarm in at
the gates, which Sinon hath treacherously opened.        And as
he spake others came up under the light of the moon, as
Hypanis and Dymas and young Cor      bus, who had but newly
come to Troy, seeking Cassandra to be his wife. To whom
       neas spake:        If ye are minded, my brethren, to follow me
to the death, come on. For how things fare this night ye see.
The gods who were the stay of this city have departed from
it; nor is aught remaining to which we may bring succor.
Yet can we die as brave men in battle. And haply he that
counts his life to be lost may yet save it.        Then, even as
ravening wolves hasten through the mist seeking for prey,
so they went through the city, doing dreadful deeds. And for
a while the men of Greece fled before them.

First of all there met them Androgeos with a great company
following him, who, thinking them to be friends, said,        Haste,
comrades; why are ye so late? We are spoiling this city of
Troy and ye are but newly come from the ships.        But forthwith,[Pg 160]
for they answered him not as he had looked for, he knew
that he had fallen among enemies. Then even as one who
treads upon a snake unawares among thorns and flies from it
when it rises angrily against him with swelling neck, so
Androgeos would have fled. But the men of Troy rushed on
and, seeing that they knew all the place and that great fear
was upon the Greeks, slew many men. Then said Cor      bus,
       We have good luck in this matter, my friends. Come now,
let us change our shields and put upon us the armor of these
Greeks. For whether we deal with our enemy by craft or by
force, who will ask?        Then he took to himself the helmet and
shield of Androgeos and also girded the sword upon him. In
like manner did the others, and thus, going disguised among
the Greeks, slew many, so that some again fled to the ships
and some were fain to climb into the horse of wood. But lo!
men came dragging by the hair from the temple of Minerva
the virgin Cassandra, whom when Cor      bus beheld, and how
she lifted up her eyes to heaven (but as for her hands, they were
bound with iron), he endured not the sight, but threw himself
upon those that dragged her, the others following him. Then
did a grievous mischance befall them, for the men of Troy
that stood upon the roof of the temple cast spears against them,
judging them to be enemies. The Greeks also, being wroth
that the virgin should be taken from them, fought the more
fiercely, and many who had before been put to flight in the
city came against them and prevailed, being indeed many
against few. Then first of all fell Cor      bus, being slain by
Peneleus the B      otian, and Rhipeus also, the most righteous
of all the sons of Troy. But the gods dealt not with him after
his righteousness. Hypanis also was slain and Dymas, and
Panthus escaped not for all that more than other men he feared
the gods and was also the priest of Apollo.

Then was        neas severed from the rest, having with him[Pg 161]
two only, Iphitus and Pelias, Iphitus being an old man and
Pelias sorely wounded by Ulysses. And these, hearing a great
shouting, hastened to the palace of King Priam, where the
battle was fiercer than in any place beside. For some of the
Greeks were seeking to climb the walls, laying ladders thereto,
whereon they stood, holding forth their shields with their
left hands and with their right grasping the roofs. And the
men of Troy, on the other hand, being in the last extremity,
tore down the battlements and the gilded beams wherewith
the men of old had adorned the palace. Then        neas, knowing
of a secret door whereby the unhappy Andromache in past
days had been wont to enter, bringing her son Astyanax to
his grandfather, climbed on to the roof and joined himself
to those that fought therefrom. Now upon this roof there was
a tower, whence all Troy could be seen and the camp of the
Greeks and the ships. This the men of Troy loosened from
its foundations with bars of iron, and thrust it over, so that it
fell upon the enemy, slaying many of them. But not the
less did others press forward, casting the while stones and javelins
and all that came to their hands.

Meanwhile others sought to break down the gates of the
palace, Pyrrhus, son of Achilles, being foremost among them,
clad in shining armor of bronze. Like to a serpent was he,
which sleeps indeed during the winter, but in the spring comes
forth into the light, full-fed on evil herbs, and, having cast
his skin and renewed his youth, lifts his head into the light
of the sun and hisses with forked tongue. And with Pyrrhus
were tall Periphas, and Automedon, who had been armor-bearer
to his father Achilles, and following them the youth of
Scyros, which was the kingdom of his grandfather Lycomedes.
With a great battle-axe he hewed through the doors, breaking
down also the door-posts, though they were plated with bronze,
making, as it were, a great window, through which a man[Pg 162]
might see the palace within, the hall of King Priam and of the
kings who had reigned aforetime in Troy. But when they
that were within perceived it, there arose a great cry of women
wailing aloud and clinging to the doors and kissing them.
But ever Pyrrhus pressed on, fierce and strong as ever was his
father Achilles, nor could aught stand against him, either the
doors or they that guarded them. Then, as a river bursts
its banks and overflows the plain, so did the sons of Greece
rush into the palace.

But old Priam, when he saw the enemy in his hall, girded
on him his armor, which now by reason of old age he had long
laid aside, and took a spear in his hand and would have gone
against the adversary, only Queen Hecuba called to him from
where she sat. For she and her daughters had fled to the great
altar of the household gods and sat crowded about it like unto
doves that are driven by a storm. Now the altar stood in an
open court that was in the midst of the palace, with a great
bay-tree above it. So when she saw Priam, how he had girded
himself with armor as a youth, she cried to him and said,
       What hath bewitched thee, that thou girdest thyself with
armor? It is not the sword that shall help us this day; no,
not though my own Hector were here, but rather the gods and
their altars. Come hither to us, for here thou wilt be safe,
or at the least wilt die with us.       

So she made the old man sit down in the midst. But lo!
there came flying through the palace, Polites, his son, wounded
to death by the spear of Pyrrhus, and Pyrrhus close behind
him. And he, even as he came into the sight of his father
and his mother, fell dead upon the ground. But when King
Priam saw it he contained not himself, but cried aloud,        Now
may the gods, if there be any justice in heaven, recompense
thee for this wickedness, seeing that thou hast not spared to
slay the son before his father's eyes. Great Achilles, whom[Pg 163]
thou falsely callest thy sire, did not thus to Priam, though he
was an enemy, but reverenced right and truth and gave the
body of Hector for burial and sent me back to my city.       

And as he spake the old man cast a spear, but aimless and
without force, which pierced not even the boss of the shield.
Then said the son of Achilles,        Go thou and tell my father of
his unworthy son and all these evils deeds. And that thou
mayest tell him die!        And as he spake he caught in his left
hand the old man's white hair and dragged him, slipping the
while in the blood of his own son, to the altar, and then, lifting
his sword high for a blow, drove it to the hilt in the old man's
side. So King Priam, who had ruled mightily over many
peoples and countries in the land of Asia, was slain that night,
having first seen Troy burning about him and his citadel laid
even with the ground. So was his carcass cast out upon the
earth, headless and without a name.

BEOWULF AND GRENDEL
[Pg 164]

Long ago there ruled over the Danes a king called Hrothgar.
He gained success and glory in war, so that his loyal kinsmen
willingly obeyed him, and everything prospered in his land.

One day it came into his mind that he would build a princely
banquet-hall, where he might entertain both the young and
old of his kingdom; and he had the work widely made known
to many a tribe over the earth, so that they might bring
rich gifts to beautify the hall.

In course of time the banquet-house was built and towered
aloft, high and battlemented. Then Hrothgar gave it the
name of Heorot, and called his guests to the banquet, and gave
them gifts of rings and other treasures; and afterwards
every day the joyous sound of revelry rang loud in the hall,
with the music of the harp and the clear notes of the singers.

But it was not long before the pleasure of the king's men was
broken, for a wicked demon began to work mischief against
them. This cruel spirit was called Grendel, and he dwelt
on the moors and among the fens. One night he came to
Heorot when the noble guests lay at rest after the feast, and
seizing thirty thanes as they slept, set off on his homeward
journey, exulting in his booty.

At break of day his deed was known to all men, and great
was the grief among the thanes. The good King Hrothgar
also sat in sorrow, suffering heavy distress for the death of
his warriors.

Not long afterwards Grendel again appeared, and wrought
a yet worse deed of murder. After that the warriors no longer
dared to sleep at Heorot, but sought out secret resting-places,
leaving the great house empty.

[Pg 165]A long time passed. For the space of twelve winters Grendel
waged a perpetual feud against Hrothgar and his people;
the livelong night he roamed over the misty moors, visiting
Heorot, and destroying both the tried warriors and the young
men whenever he was able. Hrothgar was broken-hearted,
and many were the councils held in secret to deliberate what
it were best to do against these fearful terrors; but nothing
availed to stop the fiend's ravages.

Now the tale of Grendel's deeds went forth into many
lands; and amongst those who heard of it were the Geats,
whose king was Higelac. Chief of his thanes was a noble and
powerful warrior named Beowulf, who resolved to go to the
help of the Danes. He bade his men make ready a good sea-boat,
that he might go across the wild swan's path to seek out
Hrothgar and aid him; and his people encouraged him to go
on that dangerous errand even though he was dear to them.

So Beowulf chose fourteen of his keenest warriors, and sailed
away over the waves in his well-equipped vessel, till he came
within sight of the cliffs and mountains of Hrothgar's kingdom.
The Danish warder, who kept guard over the coast, saw them
as they were making their ship fast and carrying their bright
weapons on shore. So he mounted his horse and rode to meet
them, bearing in his hand his staff of office; and he questioned
them closely as to whence they came and what their business
was.

Then Beowulf explained their errand, and the warder,
when he had heard it, bade them pass onwards, bearing their
weapons, and gave orders that their ship should be safely
guarded.

Soon they came within sight of the fair palace Heorot, and
the warder showed them the way to Hrothgar's court, and
then bade them farewell, and returned to keep watch upon
the coast.

[Pg 166]Then the bold thanes marched forward to Heorot, their
armor and their weapons glittering as they went. Entering
the hall, they set their shields and bucklers against the walls,
placed their spears upright in a sheaf together, and sat down
on the benches, weary with their seafaring.

Then a proud liegeman of Hrothgar's stepped forward and
asked:

       Whence bring ye your shields, your gray war-shirts and
frowning helmets, and this sheaf of spears? Never saw I
men of more valiant aspect.       

       We are Higelac's boon companions,        answered Beowulf.
       Beowulf is my name, and I desire to declare my errand to
the great prince, thy lord, if he will grant us leave to approach
him.       

So Wulfgar, another of Hrothgar's chieftains, went out to
the king where he sat with the assembly of his earls and told
him of the arrival of the strangers, and Hrothgar received the
news with joy, for he had known Beowulf when he was a boy,
and had heard of his fame as a warrior. Therefore he bade
Wulfgar bring him to his presence, and soon Beowulf stood
before him and cried:

       Hail to thee, Hrothgar! I have heard the tale of Grendel,
and my people, who know my strength and prowess, have
counseled me to seek thee out. For I have wrought great
deeds in the past, and now I shall do battle against this monster.
Men say that so thick is his tawny hide that no weapon
can injure him. I therefore disdain to carry sword or shield
into the combat, but will fight with the strength of my arm
only, and either I will conquer the fiend or he will bear away
my dead body to the moor. Send to Higelac, if I fall in the
fight, my beautiful breastplate. I have no fear of death,
for Destiny must ever be obeyed.       

Then Hrothgar told Beowulf of the great sorrow caused[Pg 167]
to him by Grendel's terrible deeds, and of the failure of all
the attempts that had been made by the warriors to overcome
him; and afterwards he bade him sit down with his followers
to partake of a meal.

So a bench was cleared for the Geats, and a thane waited
upon them, and all the noble warriors gathered together, and
a great feast was held once more in Heorot with song and
revelry. Waltheow, Hrothgar's queen, came forth also, and
handed the wine-cup to each of the thanes, pledging the king
in joyful mood and thanking Beowulf for his offer of help.

At last all the company arose to go to rest; and Hrothgar
entrusted the guardianship of Heorot to Beowulf with cheering
words, and so bade him good night. Then all left the hall,
save only a watch appointed by Hrothgar, and Beowulf
himself with his followers, who laid themselves down to rest.

No long time passed before Grendel came prowling from
his home on the moors under the misty slopes. Full of his
evil purpose, he burst with fury into the hall and strode forward
raging, a hideous, fiery light gleaming from his eyes.
In the hall lay the warriors asleep, and Grendel laughed in
his heart as he gazed at them, thinking to feast upon them all.
Quickly he seized a sleeping warrior and devoured him;
then, stepping forward, he reached out his hand towards
Beowulf as he lay at rest.

But the hero was ready for him, and seized his arm in a
deadly grip such as Grendel had never felt before. Terror
arose in the monster's heart, and his mind was bent on flight;
but he could not get away.

Then Beowulf stood upright and grappled with him firmly,
and the two rocked to and fro in the struggle, knocking over
benches and shaking the hall with the violence of their fight.
Suddenly a new and terrible cry arose, the cry of Grendel in
fear and pain, for never once did Beowulf relax his hold upon[Pg 168]
him. Then many of Beowulf's earls drew their swords and
rushed to aid their master; but no blade could pierce him and
nothing but Beowulf's mighty strength could prevail.

At last the monster's arm was torn off at the shoulder, and
sick unto death, he fled to the fens, there to end his joyless
life. Then Beowulf rejoiced at his night's work, wherein he
had freed Heorot forever from the fiend's ravages.

Now on the morrow the warriors flocked to the hall; and
when they heard what had taken place, they went out and
followed Grendel's tracks to a mere upon the moors, into
which he had plunged and given up his life. Then, sure of
his death, they returned rejoicing to Heorot, talking of
Beowulf's glorious deed; and there they found the king and
queen and a great company of people awaiting them.

And now there was great rejoicing and happiness. Fair
and gracious were the thanks that Hrothgar gave to Beowulf,
and great was the feast prepared in Heorot. Cloths embroidered
with gold were hung along the walls and the hall was
decked in every possible way.

When all were seated at the feast, Hrothgar bade the
attendants bring forth his gifts to Beowulf as a reward of
victory. He gave him an embroidered banner, a helmet
and breastplate, and a valuable sword, all adorned with gold
and richly ornamented. Also he gave orders to the servants
to bring into the court eight horses, on one of which was a
curiously adorned and very precious saddle, which the king
was wont to use himself when he rode to practice the sword-game.
These also he gave to Beowulf, thus like a true man
requiting his valiant deeds with horses and other precious
gifts. He bestowed treasures also on each of Beowulf's
followers and gave orders that a price should be paid in gold
for the man whom the wicked Grendel had slain.

After this there arose within the hall the din of voices and[Pg 169]
the sound of song; the instruments also were brought out
and Hrothgar's minstrel sang a ballad for the delight of the
warriors. Waltheow too came forth, bearing in her train
presents for Beowulf       a cup, two armlets, raiment and rings,
and the largest and richest collar that could be found in all
the world.

Now when evening came Hrothgar departed to his rest,
and the warriors cleared the hall and lay down to sleep once
more, with their shields and armor beside them as was their
custom. But Beowulf was not with them, for another resting-place
had been assigned to him that night, for all thought that
there was now no longer any danger to be feared.

But in this they were mistaken, as they soon learnt to their
cost. For no sooner were they all asleep than Grendel's
mother, a monstrous witch who dwelt at the bottom of a
cold mere, came to Heorot to avenge her son and burst into
the hall. The thanes started up in terror, hastily grasping
their swords; but she seized upon Asher, the most beloved
of Hrothgar's warriors, who still lay sleeping, and bore him
off with her to the fens, carrying also with her Grendel's
arm, which lay at one end of the hall.

Then there arose an uproar and the sound of mourning in
Heorot. In fierce and gloomy mood Hrothgar summoned
Beowulf and told him the ghastly tale, begging him, if he
dared, to go forth to seek out the monster and destroy it.

Full of courage, Beowulf answered with cheerful words,
promising that Grendel's mother should not escape him;
and soon he was riding forth fully equipped on his quest,
accompanied by Hrothgar and many a good warrior. They
were able to follow the witch's tracks right through the forest
glades and across the gloomy moor, till they came to a spot
where some mountain trees bent over a hoar rock, beneath
which lay a dreary and troubled lake; and there beside the[Pg 170]
water's edge lay the head of Asher, and they knew that the
witch must be at the bottom of the water.

Full of grief, the warriors sat down, while Beowulf arrayed
himself in his cunningly fashioned coat of mail and his richly
ornamented helmet. Then he turned to Hrothgar and spoke
a last word to him.

       If the fight go against me, great chieftain, be thou a guardian
to my thanes, my kinsmen and my trusty comrades;
and send thou to Higelac those treasures that thou gavest
me, that he may know thy kindness to me. Now will I earn
glory for myself, or death shall take me away.       

So saying, he plunged into the gloomy lake, at the bottom
of which was Grendel's mother. Very soon she perceived his
approach, and rushing forth, grappled with him and dragged
him down to her den, where many horrible sea-beasts joined
in the fight against him. This den was so fashioned that the
water could not enter it, and it was lit by the light of a fire
that shone brightly in the midst of it.

And now Beowulf drew his sword and thrust at his terrible
foe; but the weapon could not injure her, and he was forced
to fling it away and trust in the powerful grip of his arms
as he had done with Grendel. Seizing the witch, he shook
her till she sank down on the ground; but she quickly rose
again and requited him with a terrible hand-clutch, which
caused Beowulf to stagger and then fall. Throwing herself
upon him, she seized a dagger to strike him; but he wrenched
himself free and once more stood upright.

Then he suddenly perceived an ancient sword hanging upon
the wall of the den, and seized it as a last resource. Fierce
and savage, but well-nigh hopeless, he struck the monster
heavily upon the neck with it. Then, to his joy, the blade
pierced right through her body and she sank down dying.

At that moment the flames of the fire leapt up, throwing[Pg 171]
a brilliant light over the den; and there against the wall
Beowulf beheld the dead body of Grendel lying on a couch.
With one swinging blow of the powerful sword he struck off
his head as a trophy to carry to Hrothgar.

But now a strange thing happened, for the blade of the
sword began to melt away even as ice melts, and soon nothing
was left of it save the hilt. Carrying this and Grendel's
head, Beowulf now left the den and swam upwards to the
surface of the lake.

There the thanes met him with great rejoicings, and some
quickly helped him to undo his armor, while others prepared
to carry the great head of Grendel back to Heorot. It took
four men to carry it, and ghastly, though wonderful, was the
sight of it.

And now once more the warriors assembled in Heorot, and
Beowulf recounted to Hrothgar the full tale of his adventure
and presented to him the hilt of the wonderful sword. Again
the king thanked him from the depth of his heart for his
valiant deeds; and as before a fair feast was prepared and the
warriors made merry till night came and they repaired to
rest, certain this time of their safety.

Now on the morrow Beowulf and his nobles made ready to
depart to their own land; and when they were fully equipped
they went to bid farewell to Hrothgar. Then Beowulf spoke,
saying:

       Now are we voyagers eager to return to our lord Higelac.
We have been right well and heartily entertained, O king,
and if there is aught further that I can ever do for thee, then
I shall be ready for thy service. If ever I hear that thy
neighbors are again persecuting thee, I will bring a thousand
thanes to thy aid; and I know that Higelac will uphold me
in this.       

       Dear are thy words to me, O Beowulf,        Hrothgar made[Pg 172]
answer,        and great is thy wisdom. If Fate should take away
the life of Higelac; the Geats could have no better king than
thou; and hereafter there shall never more be feuds between
the Danes and the Geats, for thou by thy great deeds hast
made a lasting bond of friendship between them.       

Then Hrothgar gave more gifts to Beowulf and bade him
seek his beloved people and afterwards come back again to
visit him, for so dearly had he grown to love him that he
longed to see him again.

So the two embraced and bade each other farewell with
great affection, and then at last Beowulf went down to where
his ship rode at anchor and sailed away with his followers to
his own country, taking with him the many gifts that Hrothgar
had made to him. And coming to Higelac's court, he told
him of his adventures, and having shown him the treasure,
gave it all up to him, so loyal and true was he. But Higelac
in return gave Beowulf a goodly sword and seven thousand
pieces of gold and a manor-house, also a princely seat for him
to dwell in. There Beowulf lived in peace, and not for many
years was he called to fresh adventures.


Beowulf and the Fire-Dragon

After his return to the land of the Geats, Beowulf served
Higelac faithfully till the day of the king's death, which befell
in an expedition that he made to Friesland. Beowulf was
with him on that disastrous journey, and only with difficulty
did he escape with his life. But when he returned as a poor
solitary fugitive to his people, Hygd, Higelac's wife, offered
him the kingdom and the king's treasures, for she feared that
her young son Heardred was not strong enough to hold the
throne of his fathers against invading foes.

Beowulf, however, would not accept the kingdom, but
rather chose to uphold Heardred among the people, giving
him friendly counsel and serving him faithfully and honorably.

[Pg 173]But before very long Heardred was killed in battle, and
then at last Beowulf consented to become king of the Geats.

For fifty years he ruled well and wisely and his people
prospered. But at last trouble came in the ravages of a
terrible dragon, and once more Beowulf was called forth to
a terrific combat.

For three hundred years this dragon had kept watch over
a hoard of treasure on a mountain by the seashore in the
country of the Geats. The treasure had been hidden in a
cave under the mountain by a band of sea-robbers; and when
the last of them was dead the dragon took possession of the
cave and of the treasure and kept fierce watch over them.

But one day a poor man came to the spot while the dragon
was fast asleep and carried off part of the treasure to his
master.

When the dragon awoke he soon discovered the man's
footprints, and on examining the cave he found that part of
the gold and splendid jewels had disappeared. In wrathful
and savage mood he sought all round the mountain for the
robber, but could find no one.

So when evening came he went forth eager for revenge,
and throwing out flashes of fire in every direction, he began
to set fire to all the land. Beowulf's own princely manor-house
was burnt down and terrible destruction was wrought
on every hand, till day broke and the fire-dragon returned to
his den.

Great was Beowulf's grief at this dire misfortune, and eager
was his desire for vengeance. He scorned to seek the foe
with a great host behind him, nor did he dread the combat
in any way, for he called to mind his many feats of war, and
especially his fight with Grendel.

So he quickly had fashioned a mighty battle-shield, made
entirely of iron, for he knew that the wooden one that he was[Pg 174]
wont to use would be burnt up by the flames of the fire-dragon.
Then he chose out eleven of his earls, and together they set
out for the mountain, led thither by the man who had stolen
the treasure.

When they came to the mouth of the cave Beowulf bade
farewell to his companions, for he was resolved to fight single-handed
against the foe.

       Many a fight have I fought in my youth,        he said,        and
now once more will I, the guardian of my people, seek the
combat. I would not bear any sword or other weapon against
the dragon if I thought that I could grapple with him as I did
with the monster Grendel. But I fear that I shall not be
able to approach so close to this foe, for he will send forth hot,
raging fire and venomous breath. Yet am I resolute in mood,
fearless and resolved not to yield one foot's-breadth to the
monster.

       Tarry ye here on the hill, my warriors, and watch which of
us two will survive the deadly combat, for this is no enterprise
for you. I only can attempt it, because such great strength
has been given to me. Therefore I will do battle alone and
will either slay the dragon and win the treasure for my people
or fall in the fight, as destiny shall appoint.       

When he had spoken thus Beowulf strode forward to the
fight, armed with his iron shield, his sword and his dagger.
A stone arch spanned the mouth of the cave, and on one side
a boiling stream, hot as though with raging fires, rushed
forth. Undaunted by it, Beowulf uttered a shout to summon
the dragon to the fight. Immediately a burning breath from
the monster came out of the rock, the earth rumbled and then
the dragon rushed forth to meet his fate.

Standing with his huge shield held well before him, Beowulf
received the attack and struck from beneath his shield at the
monster's side. But his blade failed him and turned aside,[Pg 175]
and the blow but served to enrage the dragon, so that he darted
forth such blasting rays of deadly fire that Beowulf was well
nigh overwhelmed and the fight went hard with him.

Now his eleven chosen comrades could see the combat from
where they stood; and one of them, Beowulf's kinsman Wiglaf,
was moved to great sorrow at the sight of his lord's distress.
At last he could bear it no longer, but grasped his wooden
shield and his sword and cried to the other thanes:

       Remember how we promised our lord in the banquet-hall,
when he gave us our helmets and swords and battle-gear, that
we would one day repay him for his gifts. Now is the day
come that our liege lord has need of the strength of good
warriors. We must go help him, even though he thought to
accomplish this mighty work alone, for we can never return
to our homes if we have not slain the enemy and saved our
king's life. Rather than live when he is dead, I will perish
with him in this deadly fire.       

Then he rushed through the noisome smoke to his lord's
side, crying:

       Dear Beowulf, take courage. Remember thy boast that
thy valor shall never fail thee in thy lifetime, and defend thyself
now with all thy might, and I will help thee.       

But the other warriors were afraid to follow him, so that
Beowulf and Wiglaf stood alone to face the dragon.

As soon as the monster advanced upon them, Wiglaf s
wooden shield was burnt away by the flames, so that he was
forced to take refuge behind Beowulf's iron shield; and this
time when Beowulf struck with his sword, it was shivered
to pieces. Then the dragon flung himself upon him and caught
him up in his arms, crushing him till he lay senseless and
covered with wounds.

But now Wiglaf showed his valor and strength, and smote
the monster with such mighty blows that at last the fire[Pg 176]
coming forth from him began to abate somewhat. Then
Beowulf came once more to his senses, and drawing his deadly
knife, struck with it from beneath; and at last the force of
the blows from the two noble kinsmen felled the fierce fire-dragon
and he sank down dead beside them.

But Beowulf's wounds were very great, and he knew that
the joys of life were ended for him and that death was very
near. So while Wiglaf with wonderful tenderness unfastened
his helmet for him and refreshed him with water, he spoke,
saying:

       Though I am sick with mortal wounds, there is yet some
comfort remaining for me. For I have governed my people
for fifty winters and kept them safe from invading foes; yet
have not sought out quarrels nor led my kinsmen to dire
slaughter when there was no need. Therefore the Ruler of
all men will not blame me when my life departs from my
body.

       And now go thou quickly, dear Wiglaf, to spy out the
treasure within the cave, so that I may see what wealth I have
won for my people before I die.       

So Wiglaf went into the cave and there he saw many precious
jewels, old vessels, helmets, gold armlets and other treasures,
which excelled in beauty and number any that mankind has
ever known. Moreover, high above the treasure flapped a
marvelous gilded standard, from which came a ray of light
which lit up all the cave.

Then Wiglaf seized as much as he could carry of the precious
spoils, and taking the standard also, hastened back to his lord,
dreading lest he should find him already dead.

Beowulf was very near his life's end, but when Wiglaf had
again revived him with water, he had strength to speak once
more.



Siegfried came off victor in every encounter






Beowulf face to face with the fire-breathing dragon


[Pg 177]
       Glad am I,        he said,        that I have been able before my
death to gain so much for my people. But now I may no
longer abide here. Bid the gallant warriors burn my body
on the headland here which juts into the sea, and afterwards
raise a huge mound on the same spot, that the sailors who
drive their vessels over the misty floods may call it Beowulf's
Mound.       

Then the dauntless prince undid the golden collar from his
neck and gave it to Wiglaf with his helmet and coat of mail,
saying:

       Thou art the last of all our race, for Fate has swept away
all my kindred save thee to their doom, and now I also must
join them,        and with these words the aged king fell back dead.

Now as Wiglaf sat by his lord, grieving sorely at his death,
the other ten thanes who had shown themselves to be faithless
and cowardly approached with shame to his side. Then Wiglaf
turned to them, crying bitterly:

       Truly our liege lord flung away utterly in vain the battle-gear
that he gave ye. Little could he boast of his comrades
when the hour of need came. I myself was able to give him
some succor in the fight, but ye should have stood by him also
to defend him. But now the giving of treasure shall cease
for ye and ye will be shamed and will lose your land-right when
the nobles learn of your inglorious deed. Death is better for
every earl than ignominious life.       

After this Wiglaf summoned the other earls and told them
of all that had happened and of the mound that Beowulf
wished them to build. Then they gathered together at the
mouth of the cave and gazed with tears upon their lifeless
lord and looked with awe upon the huge dragon as it lay stiff
in death beside its conqueror. Afterwards, led by Wiglaf,
seven chosen earls entered the cave and brought forth all the
treasure, while others busied themselves in preparing the
funeral pyre.

[Pg 178]When all was ready and the huge pile of wood had been
hung with helmets, war-shields and bright coats of mail, as
befitted the funeral pyre of a noble warrior, the earls brought
their beloved lord's body to the spot and laid it on the wood.
Then they kindled the fire and stood by mourning and uttering
sorrowful chants, while the smoke rose up and the fire roared
and the body was consumed away. Afterwards they built
a mound on the hill, making it high and broad so that it could
be seen from very far away. Ten days they spent in building
it; and because they desired to pay the highest of honors to
Beowulf, they buried in it the whole of the treasure that the
dragon had guarded, for no price was too heavy to pay as a
token of their love for their lord. So the treasure even now
remains in the earth, as useless as it was before.

When at last the mound was completed, the noble warriors
gathered together and rode around it, lamenting their king
and singing the praise of his valor and mighty deeds.

Thus mourned the people of the Geats for the fall of Beowulf,
who of all kings in the world was the mildest and kindest,
the most gracious to his people, and the most eager to win
their praise.

THE GOOD KING ARTHUR
[Pg 179]

Probably every one knows the story of the great King Arthur
who, the legends say, ruled in Britain so many, many years
ago and gathered about him in his famous Round Table,
knights of splendid courage, tried and proven. So well loved
was the story of Arthur in other countries as well as in England
that it was among the very first works ever printed in Europe,
and it was still welcomed centuries later when the great
English poet, Alfred Tennyson, told it in his Idylls of the King.

The boy Arthur was really the son of King Uther Pendragon,
but few persons knew of his birth. Uther had given him into
the care of the enchanter Merlin, who had carried him to the
castle of Sir Hector,[A] an old friend of Uther's. Here the young
prince lived as a child of the house.

Now Merlin was a very wise man, and when King Uther
died several years later the noblemen asked his advice in
choosing a new king.

       Gather together in St. Stephen's Church in London, on
Christmas Day,        was all the enchanter answered.

So the knights assembled, and when the mass was over and
they passed out into the churchyard, there they beheld a
large block of stone, upon which rested a heavy anvil. The
blade of a jeweled sword was sunk deeply into the anvil.

Wondering, the noblemen drew near. One of them discovered
an inscription upon the hilt which said that none
but the man who could draw out the sword should ever rule
in Uther's place. One by one they tried, but the sword was
firmly imbedded. No one could draw it forth.

[Pg 180]
Arthur was only a baby at this time, but some years later
Sir Hector traveled up to London, bringing with him his own
son, Sir Kay, and his foster son, Arthur. Sir Kay had just
reached manhood and was to take part in his first tournament.
Imagine his distress, therefore, when, on arriving at the
tourney ground, he discovered that he had forgotten to bring
his sword.

       I will fetch it for you,        cried the young Arthur, anxious
to be of service.

He found the apartment of Sir Kay closed and locked;
but he was determined to get a sword for his brother, and
remembering the huge anvil he had seen in the churchyard,
he hurried toward it. Grasping the hilt of the projecting
sword, he drew it out easily.

Happy over his good fortune, Arthur returned to the tourney
ground and gave the new sword to his foster brother. Sir
Hector, who stood near, recognized it.

       Where did you get that sword?        he asked.

       From the great anvil in the churchyard of St. Stephen's
I drew it,        was the answer.

But Sir Hector still doubted, and when the tournament was
over, he and all the principal nobles of the realm rode back
to the churchyard.

Arthur replaced the sword in the anvil and stood aside
while all present tried to draw it forth. None succeeded.
Then Arthur again stepped up, grasped the hilt and pulled
out the blade.

       The king, the king!        the people cried; for they knew that
at last they had found a worthy successor to the good King
Uther.

So Arthur was crowned king and entered upon that wise and
kingly rule of which the praises have so often been sung.

Following are the stories of the coming and passing of
Arthur as they are related by Tennyson:[Pg 181]


The Coming of Arthur

Leodogran, the King of Cameliard,
Had one fair daughter, and none other child;
And she was fairest of all flesh on earth,
Guinevere, and in her his one delight.

For many a petty king ere Arthur came
Ruled in this isle, and ever waging war
Each upon other, wasted all the land;
And still from time to time the heathen host
Swarm'd overseas, and harried what was left.
And so there grew great tracts of wilderness,
Wherein the beast was ever more and more,
But man was less and less, till Arthur came.
For first Aurelius lived and fought and died,
And after him King Uther fought and died,
But either fail'd to make the kingdom one.
And after these King Arthur for a space,
And thro' the puissance of his Table Round,
Drew all their petty princedoms under him,
Their king and head, and made a realm, and reign'd.

And thus the land of Cameliard was waste,
Thick with wet woods, and many a beast therein,
And none or few to scare or chase the beast;
So that wild dog and wolf and boar and bear
Came night and day, and rooted in the fields,
And wallow'd in the gardens of the King.
And ever and anon the wolf would steal
The children and devour, but now and then,
Her own brood lost or dead, lent her fierce teat
To human sucklings; and the children housed
In her foul den, there at their meat would growl,
[Pg 182]And mock their foster-mother on four feet,
Till, straighten'd, they grew up to wolf-like men,
Worse than the wolves. And King Leodogran
Groan'd for the Roman legions here again,
And Caesar's eagle: then his brother king,
Urien, assail'd him: last a heathen horde,
Reddening the sun with smoke and earth with blood,
And on the spike that split the mother's heart
Spitting the child, brake on him, till, amazed,
He knew not whither he should turn for aid.

But       for he heard of Arthur newly crown'd,
Tho' not without an uproar made by those
Who cried,        He is not Uther's so.              the King
Sent to him, saying,        Arise, and help us thou!
For here between the man and beast we die.       

And Arthur yet had done no deed of arms,
But heard the call, and came: and Guinevere
Stood by the castle walls to watch him pass;
But since he neither wore on helm or shield
The golden symbol of his kinglihood,
But rode a simple knight among his knights,
And many of these in richer arms than he,
She saw him not, or mark'd not, if she saw,
One among many, tho' his face was bare.
But Arthur, looking downward as he past,
Felt the light of her eyes into his life
Smite on the sudden, yet rode on, and pitch'd
His tents beside the forest. Then he drave
The heathen; after, slew the beast, and fell'd
The forest, letting in the sun, and made
Broad pathways for the hunter and the knight,
And so return'd.

[Pg 183]

For while he linger'd there,
A doubt that ever smoulder'd in the hearts
Of those great Lords and Barons of his realm
Flash'd forth and into war: for most of these,
Colleaguing with a score of petty kings,
Made head against him, crying,        Who is he
That he should rule us? who hath proven him
King Uther's son? for lo! we look at him,
And find nor face nor bearing, limbs nor voice,
Are like to those of Uther whom we knew.
This is the son of Gorlo      s, not the King;
This is the son of Anton, not the King.       

And Arthur, passing thence to battle, felt
Travail, and throes and agonies of the life,
Desiring to be join'd with Guinevere;
And thinking as he rode,        Her father said
That there between the man and beast they die.
Shall I not lift her from this land of beasts
Up to my throne, and side by side with me?
What happiness to reign a lonely king,
Vext       O ye stars that shudder over me,
O earth that soundest hollow under me,
Vext with waste dreams? for saving I be join'd
To her that is the fairest under heaven,
I seem as nothing in the mighty world,
And cannot will my will, nor work my work
Wholly, nor make myself in mine own realm
Victor and lord. But were I join'd with her,
Then might we live together as one life,
And reigning with one will in everything
Have power on this dark land to lighten it,
And power on this dead world to make it live.       

[Pg 184]

Thereafter       as he speaks who tells the tale       
When Arthur reached a field-of-battle bright
With pitch'd pavilions of his foe, the world
Was all so clear about him, that he saw
The smallest rock far on the faintest hill,
And even in high day the morning star.
So when the King had set his banner broad,
At once from either side, with trumpet-blast,
And shouts, and clarions shrilling unto blood,
The long-lanced battle let their horses run.
And now the barons and the kings prevail'd,
And now the King, as here and there that war
Went swaying; but the Powers who walk the world
Made lightnings and great thunders over him,
And dazed all eyes, till Arthur by main might
And mightier of his hands with every blow,
And leading all his knighthood threw the kings
Car        dos, Urien, Cradlemont of Wales,
Claudias, and Clariance of Northumberland,
The King Brandagoras of Latangor,
With Anguisant of Erin, Morganore,
And Lot of Orkney. Then, before a voice
As dreadful as the shout of one who sees
To one who sins, and deems himself alone
And all the world asleep, they swerved and brake
Flying, and Arthur call'd to stay the brands
That hack'd among the flyers,        Ho! they yield!       
So like a painted battle the war stood
Silenced, the living quiet as the dead,
And in the heart of Arthur joy was lord.
He laugh'd upon his warrior whom he loved
And honor'd most.        Thou dost not doubt me King,
So well thine arm hath wrought for me today.       [Pg 185]
       Sir and my liege,        he cried,        the fire of God
Descends upon thee in the battle-field:
I know thee for my King!         Whereat the two,
For each had warded either in the fight,
Sware on the field of death a deathless love.
And Arthur said,        Man's word is God in man:
Let chance what will, I trust thee to the death.       

Then quickly from the foughten field he sent
Ulfius, and Brastias, and Bedivere,
His new-made knights, to King Leodogran,
Saying,        If I in aught have served thee well,
Give me thy daughter Guinevere to wife.       

Whom when he heard, Leodogran in heart
Debating-.       How should I that am a king,
However much he help me at my need,
Give my one daughter saving to a king,
And a king's son.              lifted his voice, and call'd
A hoary man, his chamberlain, to whom
He trusted all things, and of him required
His counsel:        Knowest thou aught of Arthur's birth?       

Then spake the hoary chamberlain and said,
       Sir King, there be but two old men that know:
And each is twice as old as I; and one
Is Merlin, the wise man that ever served
King Uther thro' his magic art; and one
Is Merlin's master (so they call him) Bleys,
Who taught him magic; but the scholar ran
Before the master, and so far, that Bleys
Laid magic by, and sat him down, and wrote
All things and whatsoever Merlin did
[Pg 186]In one great annal-book, where after-years
Will learn the secret of our Arthur's birth.       

To whom the King Leodogran replied,
       O friend, had I been holpen half as well
By this King Arthur as by thee today,
Then beast and man had had their share of me:
But summon here before us yet once more
Ulfius, and Brastias, and Bedivere.       

Then, when they came before him, the King said,
       I have seen the cuckoo chased by lesser fowl,
And reason in the chase: but wherefore now
Do these your lords stir up the heat of war,
Some calling Arthur born of Gorlo      s,
Others of Anton? Tell me, ye yourselves,
Hold ye this Arthur for King Uther's son?       

And Ulfius and Brastias answer'd,        Ay.       
Then Bedivere, the first of all his knights,
Knighted by Arthur at his crowning, spake       
For bold in heart and act and word was he,
Whenever slander breathed against the King       

       Sir, there be many rumors on this head:
For there be those who hate him in their hearts,
Call him base-born, and since his ways are sweet,
And theirs are bestial, hold him less than man:
And there be those who deem him more than man,
And dream he dropt from heaven: but my belief
In all this matter       so ye care to learn       
Sir, for ye know that in King Uther's time
The prince and warrior Gorlo      s, he that held
[Pg 187]Tintagil castle by the Cornish sea,
Was wedded with a winsome wife, Ygerne:
And daughters had she borne him       one whereof,
Lot's wife, the Queen of Orkney, Bellicent,
Hath ever like a loyal sister cleaved
To Arthur       but a son she had not borne.
And Uther cast upon her eyes of love:
But she, a stainless wife to Gorlo      s,
So loathed the bright dishonor of his love,
That Gorlo      s and King Uther went to war:
And overthrown was Gorlo      s and slain.
Then Uther in his wrath and heat besieged
Ygerne within Tintagil, where her men,
Seeing the mighty swarm about their walls,
Left her and fled, and Uther enter'd in,
And there was none to call to but himself.
So, compass'd by the power of the King,
Enforced she was to wed him in her tears,
And with a shameful swiftness: afterward,
Not many moons, King Uther died himself,
Moaning and wailing for an heir to rule
After him, lest the realm should go to wrack.
And that same night, the night of the new year;
By reason of the bitterness and grief
That vext his mother, all before his time
Was Arthur born, and all as soon as born
Deliver'd at a secret postern-gate
To Merlin, to be holden far apart
Until his hour should come; because the lords
Of that fierce day were as the lords of this,
Wild beasts, and surely would have torn the child
Piecemeal among them, had they known; for each
But sought to rule for his own self and hand,
[Pg 188]And many hated Uther for the sake
Of Gorlo      s. Wherefore Merlin took the child,
And gave him to Sir Anton, an old knight
And ancient friend of Uther; and his wife
Nursed the young prince, and rear'd him with her own;
And no man knew. And ever since the lords
Have foughten like wild beasts among themselves,
So that the realm has gone to wrack: but now,
This year, when Merlin (for his hour had come)
Brought Arthur forth, and set him in the hall,
Proclaiming, 'Here is Uther's heir, your king,'
A hundred voices cried, 'Away with him!
No king of ours! A son of Gorlo      s he,
Or else the child of Anton and no king,
Or else base-born.'  Yet Merlin thro' his craft,
And while the people clamor'd for a king,
Had Arthur crown'd; but after, the great lords
Banded, and so brake out in open war.       

Then while the King debated with himself
If Arthur were the child of shamefulness,
Or born the son of Gorlo      s, after death,
Or Uther's son, and born before his time,
Or whether there were truth in anything
Said by these three, there came to Cameliard,
With Gawain and young Modred, her two sons,
Lot's wife, the Queen of Orkney, Bellicent;
Whom as he could, not as he would, the King
Made feast for, saying, as they sat at meat:

       A doubtful throne is ice on summer seas.
Ye come from Arthur's court. Victor his men
Report him! Yea, but ye       think ye this king       
[Pg 189]So many those that hate him, and so strong,
So few his knights, however brave they be       
Hath body enow to hold his foemen down?       

       O King,        she cried,        and I will tell thee: few,
Few, but all brave, all of one mind with him;
For I was near him when the savage yells
Of Uther's peerage died and Arthur sat
Crown'd on the da      s, and his warriors cried,
'Be thou the king, and we will work thy will,
Who love thee.' Then the King in low deep tones,
And simple words of great authority,
Bound them by so strait vows to his own self,
That when they rose, knighted from kneeling, some
Were pale as at the passing of a ghost.
Some flush'd, and others dazed, as one who wakes
Half-blinded at the coming of a light.

       But when he spake and cheer'd his Table Round
With large, divine and comfortable words,
Beyond my tongue to tell thee       I beheld
From eye to eye thro' all their Order flash
A momentary likeness of the King:
And ere it left their faces, thro' the cross
And those around it and the Crucified,
Down from the casement over Arthur, smote
Flame-color, vert, and azure, in three rays,
One falling upon each of three fair queens,
Who stood in silence near his throne, the friends
Of Arthur, gazing on him, tall, with bright
Sweet faces, who will help him at his need.

[Pg 190]

       And there I saw mage Merlin, whose vast wit
And hundred winters are but as the hands
Of loyal vassals toiling for their liege.

       And near him stood the Lady of the Lake,
Who knows a subtler magic than his own       
Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful.
She gave the King his huge cross-hilted sword,
Whereby to drive the heathen out: a mist
Of incense curl'd about her, and her face
Well-nigh was hidden in the minster gloom;
But there was heard among the holy hymns
A voice as of the waters, for she dwells
Down in a deep, calm, whatsoever storms
May shake the world, and when the surface rolls,
Hath power to walk the waters like our Lord.

       There likewise I beheld Excalibur
Before him at his crowning borne, the sword
That rose from out the bosom of the lake,
And Arthur row'd across and took it       rich
With jewels, elfin Urim, on the hilt,
Bewildering heart and eye       the blade so bright
That men are blinded by it       on one side,
Graven in the oldest tongue of all this world,
'Take me,' but turn the blade and ye shall see,
And written in the speech ye speak yourself,
'Cast me away!'  And sad was Arthur's face
Taking it, but old Merlin counseled him,
'Take thou and strike! the time to cast away
Is yet far-off.'  So this great brand the king
Took, and by this will beat his foemen down.       [Pg 191]

Thereat Leodogran rejoiced, but thought
To sift his doubtings to the last, and ask'd,
Fixing full eyes of question on her face,
       The swallow and the swift are near akin,
But thou art closer to this noble prince,
Being his own dear siste.       ; and she said,
       Daughter of Gorlo      s and Ygerne am .       ;
       And therefore Arthur's sister?        asked the King.
She answered,        These be secret things,        and sign'd
To those two sons to pass and let them be.
And Gawain went, and breaking into song
Sprang out, and follow'd by his flying hair
Ran like a colt, and leapt at all he saw:
But Modred laid his ear beside the doors,
And there half heard; the same that afterward
Struck for the throne, and striking found his doom.

And then the Queen made answer,        What know I?
For dark my mother was in eyes and hair,
And dark in hair and eyes am I; and dark
Was Gorlo      s, yea and dark was Uther too,
Well-nigh to blackness; but this King is fair
Beyond the race of Britons and of men.
Moreover, always in my mind I hear
A cry from out the dawning of my life,
A mother weeping, and I hear her say,
'O that ye had some brother, pretty one,
To guard thee on the rough ways of the world.'       

       Ay,        said the King,        and hear ye such a cry?
But when did Arthur chance upon thee first?       [Pg 192]

       O King!        she cried,        and I will tell thee true:
He found me first when yet a little maid:
Beaten I had been for a little fault
Whereof I was not guilty; and out I ran
And flung myself down on a bank of heath,
And hated this fair world and all therein,
And wept and wish'd that I were dead; and he       
I know not whether of himself he came,
Or brought by Merlin, who, they say, can walk
Unseen at pleasure       he was at my side,
And spake sweet words, and comforted my heart,
And dried my tears, being a child with me.
And many a time he came, and evermore
As I grew greater grew with me; and sad
At times he seem'd, and sad with him was I,
Stern too at times, and then I loved him not,
But sweet again, and then I loved him well.
And now of late I see him less and less,
But those first days had golden hours for me,
For then I surely thought he would be king.

       But let me tell thee now another tale:
For Bleys, our Merlin's master, as they say,
Died but of late, and sent his cry to me,
To hear him speak before he left his life.
Shrunk like a fairy changeling lay the mage;
And when I enter'd told me that himself
And Merlin ever served about the King,
Uther, before he died; and on the night
When Uther in Tintagil past away
Moaning and wailing for an heir, the two
Left the still King, and passing forth to breathe,
[Pg 193]Then from the castle gateway by the chasm
Descending thro' the dismal night       a night
In which the bounds of heaven and earth were lost       
Beheld, so high upon the dreary deeps
It seem'd in heaven, a ship, the shape thereof
A dragon wing'd, and all from stem to stern
Bright with a shining people on the decks,
And gone as soon as seen. And then the two
Dropt to the cove, and watch'd the great sea fall,
Wave after wave, each mightier than the last,
Till last, a ninth one, gathering half the deep
And full of voices, slowly rose and plunged
Roaring, and all the wave was in a flame:
And down the wave and in the flame was borne
A naked babe, and rode to Merlin's feet,
Who stoopt and caught the babe, and cried 'The King!
Here is an heir for Uther!'  And the fringe
Of that great breaker, sweeping up the strand,
Lash'd at the wizard as he spake the word.
And all at once all round him rose in fire,
So that the child and he were clothed in fire.
And presently thereafter follow'd calm,
Free sky and stars: 'And this same child,' he said,
'Is he who reigns: nor could I part in peace
Till this were told.'  And saying this the seer
Went thro' the strait and dreadful pass of death,
Not ever to be question'd any more
Save on the further side; but when I met
Merlin, and ask'd him if these things were truth       
The shining dragon and the naked child
Descending in the glory of the seas       
He laugh'd as is his wont, and answer'd me
In riddling triplets of old time, and said:
[Pg 194]
       'Rain, rain, and sun! a rainbow in the sky!
A young man will be wiser by and by;
An old man's wit may wander ere he die.

       'Rain, rain, and sun! a rainbow on the lea!
And truth is this to me, and that to thee;
And truth or clothed or naked let it be.

       'Rain, sun, and rain! and the free blossom blows;
Sun, rain, and sun! and where is he who knows?
From the great deep to the great deep he goes.'

       So Merlin riddling anger'd me; but thou
Fear not to give this King thine only child,
Guinevere: so great bards of him will sing
Hereafter; and dark sayings from of old
Ranging and ringing thro' the minds of men,
And echo'd by old folk beside their fires
For comfort after their wage-work is done,
Speak of the King; and Merlin in our time
Hath spoken also, not in jest, and sworn
Tho' men may wound him that he will not die,
But pass, again to come; and then or now
Utterly smite the heathen under foot,
Till these and all men hail him for their king.       

She spake and King Leodogran rejoiced,
But musing        Shall I answer yea or nay?       
Doubted and drowsed, nodded and slept, and saw,
Dreaming, a slope of land that ever grew,
Field after field, up to a height, the peak
Haze-hidden, and thereon a phantom king,
Now looming, and now lost: and on the slope
[Pg 195]The sword rose, the hind fell, the herd was driven,
Fire glimpsed; and all the land from roof and rick,
In drifts of smoke before a rolling wind,
Stream'd to the peak, and mingled with the haze
And made it thicker; while the phantom king
Sent out at times a voice; and here or there
Stood one who pointed toward the voice, the rest
Slew on and burnt, crying,        No king of ours,
No son of Uther, and no king of our.       ;
Till with a wink his dream was changed, the haze
Descended, and the solid earth became
As nothing, but the king stood out in heaven
Crown'd. And Leodogran awoke, and sent
Ulfius, and Brastias, and Bedivere,
Back to the court of Arthur answering yea.

Then Arthur charged his warrior whom he loved
And honor'd most, Sir Lancelot, to ride forth
And bring the Queen;       and watch'd him from the gates;
And Lancelot past away among the flowers,
(For then was latter April) and return'd
Among the flowers, in May, with Guinevere.
To whom arrived, by Dubric the high saint,
Chief of the church in Britain, and before
The stateliest of her altar-shrines, the King
That morn was married, while in stainless white,
The fair beginners of a nobler time,
And glorying in their vows and him, his knights
Stood round him, and rejoicing in his joy.
Far shone the fields of May thro' open door,
The sacred altar blossom'd white with May,
The Sun of May descended on their King,
They gazed on all earth's beauty in their Queen,
[Pg 196]Roll'd incense, and there past along the hymns
A voice as of the waters, while the two
Sware at the shrine of Christ a deathless love:
And Arthur said,        Behold, thy doom is mine.
Let chance what will, I love thee to the death!       
To whom the Queen replied with drooping eyes,
       King and my lord, I love thee to the death!       
And holy Dubric spread his hands and spake,
       Reign ye, and live and love, and make the world
Other, and may thy Queen be one with thee,
And all this Order of thy Table Round
Fulfil the boundless purpose of their King!       

So Dubric said; but when they left the shrine
Great Lords from Rome before the portal stood.
In scornful stillness gazing as they past;
Then while they paced a city all on fire
With sun and cloth of gold, the trumpets blew,
And Arthur's knighthood sang before the King:       

       Blow trumpet, for the world is white with May;
Blow trumpet, the long night hath roll'd away!
Blow thro' the living world       'Let the King reign.'

       Shall Rome or heathen rule in Arthur's realm?
Flash brand and lance, fall battle-axe upon helm,
Fall battle-axe, and flash brand! Let the King reign.

       Strike for the King and live! his knights have heard
That God hath told the King a secret word.
Fall battle-axe, and flash brand! Let the King reign.

[Pg 197]

       Blow trumpet! he will lift us from the dust.
Blow trumpet! live the strength and die the lust!
Clang battle-axe, and clash brand! Let the King reign.

       Strike for the King and die! and if thou diest,
The King is King, and ever wills the highest.
Clang battle-axe, and clash brand! Let the King reign.

       Blow, for our Sun is mighty in his May!
Blow, for our Sun is mightier day by day!
Clang battle-axe, and clash brand! Let the King reign.

       The King will follow Christ, and we the King,
In whom high God hath breathed a secret thing.
Fall battle-axe, and clash brand! Let the King reign.       

So sang the knighthood, moving to their hall.
There at the banquet those great Lords from Rome,
The slowly-fading mistress of the world,
Strode in, and claim'd their tribute as of yore.
But Arthur spake,        Behold, for these have sworn
To wage my wars, and worship me their King;
The old order changeth, yielding place to new;
And we that fight for our fair father Christ,
Seeing that ye be grown too weak and old
To drive the heathen from your Roman wall,
No tribute will we pa.       : so those great lords
Drew back in wrath, and Arthur strove with Rome.

And Arthur and his knighthood for a space
Were all one will, and thro' that strength the King
Drew in the petty princedoms under him,
Fought, and in twelve great battles overcame
The heathen hordes, and made a realm and reign'd.

[Pg 198]



The Passing of Arthur

That story which the bold Sir Bedivere,
First made and latest left of all the knights,
Told, when the man was no more than a voice
In the white winter of his age, to those
With whom he dwelt, new faces, other minds.

For on their march to westward, Bedivere,
Who slowly paced among the slumbering host;
Heard in his tent the moanings of the King:

       I found Him in the shining of the stars,
I mark'd Him in the flowering of His fields,
But in His ways with men I find Him not.
I waged His wars, and now I pass and die.
O me! for why is all around us here
As if some lesser god had made the world,
But had not force to shape it as he would,
Till the High God behold it from beyond,
And enter it, and make it beautiful?
Or else as if the world were wholly fair,
But that these eyes of men are dense and dim,
And have not power to see it as it is:
Perchance, because we see not to the close;       
For I, being simple, thought to work His will,
And have but stricken with the sword in vain;
And all whereon I lean'd in wife and friend
Is traitor to my peace, and all my realm
Reels back into the beast, and is no more.
My God, thou hast forgotten me in my death:
Nay       God my Christ       I pass but shall not die.       

[Pg 199]

Then, ere that last weird battle in the west,
There came on Arthur sleeping, Gawain kill'd
In Lancelot's war, the ghost of Gawain blown
Along a wandering wind, and past his ear
Went shrilling,        Hollow, hollow all delight!
Hail King! tomorrow thou shalt pass away.
Farewell! there is an isle of rest for thee.
And I am blown along a wandering wind,
And hollow, hollow, hollow all delight.       
And fainter onward, like wild birds that change
Their season in the night and wail their way
From cloud to cloud, down the long wind the dream
Shrill'd; but in going mingled with dim cries
Far in the moonlit haze among the hills,
As of some lonely city sack'd by night,
When all is lost, and wife and child with wail
Pass to new lords! and Arthur woke and call'd,
       Who spake? A dream. O light upon the wind,
Thine, Gawain, was the voice       are these dim cries
Thine? or doth all that haunts the waste and wild
Mourn, knowing it will go along with me?       

This heard the bold Sir Bedivere and spake:
       O me, my King, let pass whatever will,
Elves, and the harmless glamour of the field;
But in their stead thy name and glory cling
To all high places like a golden cloud
For ever: but as yet thou shalt not pass.
Light was Gawain in life, and light in death
Is Gawain, for the ghost is as the man;
And care not thou for dreams from him, but rise       
I hear the steps of Modred in the west,
And with him many of thy people, and knights
[Pg 200]Once thine, whom thou hast loved, but grosser grown
Than heathen, spitting at their vows and thee.
Right well in heart they know thee for the King.
Arise, go forth and conquer as of old.       

Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere:
       Far other is this battle in the west
Whereto we move, than when we strove in youth,
And brake the petty kings, and fought with Rome,
Or thrust the heathen from the Roman wall,
And shook him thro' the north. Ill doom is mine
To war against my people and my knights.
The king who fights his people fights himself.
And they my knights, who loved me once, the stroke
That strikes them dead is as my death to me.
Yet let us hence, and find or feel a way
Thro' this blind haze, which ever since I saw
One lying in the dust at Almesbury,
Hath folded in the passes of the world.       

Then rose the King and moved his host by night,
And ever push'd Sir Modred, league by league,
Back to the sunset bound of Lyonnesse       
A land of old upheaven from the abyss
By fire, to sink into the abyss again;
Where fragments of forgotten peoples dwelt,
And the long mountains ended in a coast
Of ever-shifting sand, and far away
The phantom circle of a moaning sea.
There the pursuer could pursue no more,
And he that fled no further fly the King;
And there, that day when the great light of heaven
Burn'd at his lowest in the rolling year,
[Pg 201]On the waste sand by the waste sea they closed.
Nor ever yet had Arthur fought a fight
Like this last dim, weird battle of the west.
A death-white mist slept over sand and sea:
Whereof the chill, to him who breathed it, drew
Down with his blood, till all his heart was cold
With formless fear; and ev'n on Arthur fell
Confusion, since he saw not whom he fought,
For friend and foe were shadows in the mist,
And friend slew friend not knowing whom he slew;
And some had visions out of golden youth,
And some beheld the faces of old ghosts
Look in upon the battle; and in the mist
Was many a noble deed, many a base,
And chance and craft and strength in single fights,
And ever and anon with host to host
Shocks, and the splintering spear, the hard mail hewn,
Shield-breakings, and the clash of brands, the crash
Of battle-axes on shattered helms, and shrieks
After the Christ, of those who falling down
Look'd up for heaven, and only saw the mist:
And shouts of heathen and the traitor knights,
Oaths, insult, filth, and monstrous blasphemies,
Sweat, writhing, anguish, laboring of the lungs
In that close mist, and cryings for the light,
Moans of the dying, and voices of the dead.

Last, as by some one death-bed after wail
Of suffering, silence follows, or thro' death
Or deathlike swoon, thus over all that shore,
Save for some whisper of the seething seas,
A dead hush fell; but when the dolorous day
Grew drearier toward twilight falling, came
[Pg 202]A bitter wind, clear from the North, and blew
The mist aside, and with that wind the tide
Rose, and the pale King glanced across the field
Of battle: but no man was moving there;
Nor any cry of Christian heard thereon,
Nor yet of heathen; only the wan wave
Brake in among dead faces, to and fro
Swaying the helpless hands, and up and down
Tumbling the hollow helmets of the fallen,
And shiver'd brands that once had fought with Rome,
And rolling far along the gloomy shores
The voice of days of old and days to be.

Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere,
And whiter than the mist that all day long
Had held the field of battle was the King:
       Hearest thou this great voice that shakes the world
And wastes the narrow realm whereon we move,
And beats upon the faces of the dead,
My dead, as tho' they had not died for me?       
O Bedivere, for on my heart hath fall'n
Confusion, till I know not what I am,
Nor whence I am, nor whether I be King.
Behold, I seem but King among the dead.       

Then spake the bold Sir Bedivere:        My King,
King everywhere! and so the dead have kings,
There also will I worship thee as King.
Yet still thy life is whole, and still I live
Who love thee; but who hates thee, he that brought
The heathen back among us, yonder stands,
Modred, unharm'd, the traitor of thine house.       

[Pg 203]

Then spake the King:        My house had been my doom,
But call not thou this traitor of my house
Who hath but dwelt beneath one roof with me.
My house are rather they who sware my vows,
Yea, even while they brake them, own'd me King.
And well for thee, saying in my dark hour,
When all the purport of my throne hath fail'd,
That quick or dead thou holdest me for King.
King am I, whatsoever be their cry;
And one last act of kinghood shalt thou see
Yet, ere I pass.         And uttering this the King
Made at the man: then Modred smote his liege
Hard on that helm which many a heathen sword
Had beaten thin; while Arthur at one blow,
Striking the last stroke with Excalibur,
Slew him, and but slain himself, he fell.

So all day long the noise of battle roll'd
Among the mountains by the winter sea;
Until King Arthur's Table, man by man,
Had fall'n in Lyonnesse about their lord,
King Arthur. Then, because his wound was deep,
The bold Sir Bedivere uplifted him,
And bore him to a chapel nigh the field,
A broken chancel with a broken cross,
That stood on a dark strait of barren land:
On one side lay the Ocean, and on one
Lay a great water, and the moon was full.

Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere:
       The sequel of today unsolders all
The goodliest fellowship of famous knights
Whereof this world holds record. Such a sleep
[Pg 204]They sleep       the men I loved. I think that we
Shall never more, at any future time,
Delight our souls with talk of knightly deeds,
Walking about the gardens and the halls
Of Camelot, as in the days that were.
I perish by this people which I made,       
Tho' Merlin sware that I should come again
To rule once more; but, let what will be, be,
I am so deeply smitten thro' the helm
That without help I cannot last till morn.
Thou therefore take my brand Excalibur,
Which was my pride: for thou rememberest how
In those old days, one summer noon, an arm
Rose up from out the bosom of the lake,
Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful,
Holding the sword       and how I row'd across
And took it, and have worn it, like a king;
And, wheresoever I am sung or told
In after-time, this also shall be known:
But now delay not: take Excalibur,
And fling him far into the middle mere:
Watch what thou seest, and lightly bring me word.       

To him replied the bold Sir Bedivere:
       It is not meet, Sir King, to leave thee thus,
Aidless, alone, and smitten thro' the helm       
A little thing may harm a wounded man:
Yet I thy hest will all perform at full,
Watch what I see, and lightly bring thee word.       

So saying, from the ruin'd shrine he stept,
And in the moon athwart the place of tombs,
Where lay the mighty bones of ancient men,
[Pg 205]Old knights, and over them the sea-wind sang
Shrill, chill, with flakes of foam. He, stepping down
By zigzag paths, and juts of pointed rock,
Came on the shining levels of the lake.

There drew he forth the brand Excalibur,
And o'er him, drawing it, the winter moon,
Brightening the skirts of a long cloud, ran forth
And sparkled keen with frost against the hilt:
For all the haft twinkled with diamond sparks,
Myriads of topaz-lights, and jacinth-work
Of subtlest jewellery. He gazed so long
That both his eyes were dazzled as he stood,
This way and that dividing the swift mind,
In act to throw: but at the last it seem'd
Better to leave Excalibur conceal'd
There in the many-knotted water-flags,
That whistled stiff and dry about the marge.
So strode he back slow to the wounded King.

Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere:
       Hast thou perform'd my mission which I gave?       
What is it thou hast seen? or what hast heard?

And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere:
       I heard the ripple washing in the reeds,
And the wild water lapping on the crag.       

To whom replied King Arthur, faint and pale:
       Thou hast betray'd thy nature and thy name,
Not rendering true answer, as beseem'd
Thy fealty, nor like a noble knight:
For surer sign had follow'd, either hand,
[Pg 206]Or voice, or else a motion of the mere.
This is a shameful thing for men to lie.
Yet now, I charge thee, quickly go again,
As thou art lief and dear, and do the thing
I bade thee, watch, and lightly bring me word.       

Then went Sir Bedivere the second time
Across the ridge, and paced beside the mere,
Counting the dewy pebbles, fix'd in thought;
But when he saw the wonder of the hilt,
How curiously and strangely chased, he smote
His palms together, and he cried aloud:

       And if indeed I cast the brand away,
Surely a precious thing, one worthy note,
Should thus be lost for ever from the earth,
Which might have pleased the eyes of many men.
What good should follow this, if this were done?
What harm, undone? Deep harm to disobey,
Seeing obedience is the bond of rule.
Were it well to obey then, if a king demand
An act unprofitable, against himself?
The King is sick, and knows not what he does.
What record, or what relic of my lord
Should be to after-time, but empty breath
And rumors of a doubt? But were this kept,
Stored in some treasure-house of mighty kings,
Some one might show it at a joust of arms,
Saying, 'King Arthur's sword, Excalibur,
Wrought by the lonely maiden of the Lake.
Nine years she wrought it, sitting in the deeps
Upon the hidden bases of the hills.'
So might some old man speak in the after-time
[Pg 207]To all the people, winning reverence.
But now much honor and much fame were lost.       

So spake he, clouded with his own conceit,
And hid Excalibur the second time,
And so strode back slow to the wounded King.

Then spoke King Arthur, breathing heavily:
       What is it thou hast seen? or what hast heard?       

And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere:
       I heard the water lapping on the crag,
And the long ripple washing in the reeds.       

To whom replied King Arthur, much in wrath:
       Ah, miserable and unkind, untrue,
Unknightly, traitor-hearted! Woe is me!
Authority forgets a dying king,
Laid widow'd of the power in his eye
That bow'd the will. I see thee what thou art,
For thou, the latest-left of all my knights,
In whom should meet the offices of all,
Thou wouldst betray me for the precious hilt;
Either from lust of gold, or like a girl
Valuing the giddy pleasure of the eyes.
Yet, for a man may fail in duty twice,
And the third time may prosper, get thee hence:
But, if thou spare to fling Excalibur,
I will arise and slay thee with my hands.       

Then quickly rose Sir Bedivere, and ran,
And, leaping down the ridges lightly, plunged
Among the bulrush beds, and clutch'd the sword,
[Pg 208]And strongly wheel'd and threw it. The great brand
Made lightnings in the splendor of the moon,
And flashing round and round, and whirl'd in an arch,
Shot like a streamer of the northern morn,
Seen where the moving isles of winter shook
By night, with noises of the Northern Sea.
So flash'd and fell the brand Excalibur:
But ere he dipt the surface, rose an arm
Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful,
And caught him by the hilt, and brandish'd him
Three times, and drew him under in the mere.
And lightly went the other to the King.

Then spoke King Arthur, drawing thicker breath:
       Now see I by thine eyes that this is done.
Speak out: what is it thou hast heard, or seen?       

And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere:
       Sir King, I closed mine eyelids, lest the gems
Should blind my purpose, for I never saw,
Nor shall see, here or elsewhere, till I die,
Not tho' I live three lives of mortal men,
So great a miracle as yonder hilt.
Then with both hands I flung him, wheeling him;
But when I look'd again, behold an arm,
Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful,
That caught him by the hilt and brandish'd him
Three times, and drew him under in the mere.       

And answer made King Arthur, breathing hard:
       My end draws nigh; 'tis time that I were gone.
Make broad thy shoulders to receive my weight,
And bear me to the margin; yet I fear
My wound hath taken cold, and I shall die.       

[Pg 209]

So saying, from the pavement he half rose,
Slowly, with pain, reclining on his arm,
And looking wistfully with wide blue eyes
As in a picture. Him Sir Bedivere
Remorsefully regarded thro' his tears,
And would have spoken, but he found not words;
Then took with care, and kneeling on one knee,
O'er both his shoulders drew the languid hands,
And rising bore him thro' the place of tombs.

But, as he walk'd, King Arthur panted hard,
Like one that feels a nightmare on his bed
When all the house is mute. So sigh'd the King,
Muttering and murmuring at his ear,        Quick, quick!
I fear it is too late, and I shall die.       
But the other swiftly strode from ridge to ridge,
Clothed with his breath, and looking, as he walk'd,
Larger than human on the frozen hills.
He heard the deep behind him, and a cry
Before. His own thought drove him like a goad.
Dry clash'd his harness in the icy caves
And barren chasms, and all to left and right
The bare black cliff clang'd round him, as he based
His feet on juts of slippery crag that rang
Sharp-smitten with the dint of armed heels
And on a sudden, lo! the level lake,
And the long glories of the winter moon.

Then saw they how there hove a dusky barge,
Dark as a funeral scarf from stem to stern,
Beneath them; and descending they were ware
That all the decks were dense with stately forms,
Black-stoled, black-hooded, like a dream       by these
[Pg 210]Three Queens with crowns of gold: and from them rose
A cry that shiver'd to the tingling stars,
And, as it were one voice, an agony
Of lamentation, like a wind that shrills
All night in a waste land, where no one comes,
Or hath come, since the making of the world.

Then murmur'd Arthur,        Place me in the barge.       
So to the barge they came. There those three Queens
Put forth their hands, and took the King, and wept.
But she, that rose the tallest of them all
And fairest, laid his head upon her lap,
And loosed the shatter'd casque, and chafed his hands,
And call'd him by his name, complaining loud,
And dropping bitter tears against a brow
Striped with dark blood: for all his face was white
And colorless, and like the wither'd moon
Smote by the fresh beam of the springing east;
And all his greaves and cuisses dash'd with drops
Of onset; and the light and lustrous curls       
That made his forehead like a rising sun
High from the da      s-throne       were parch'd with dust;
Or, clotted into points and hanging loose,
Mix'd with the knightly growth that fringed his lips.
So like a shatter'd column lay the King;
Not like that Arthur who, with lance in rest,
From spur to plume a star of tournament,
Shot thro' the lists at Camelot, and charged
Before the eyes of ladies and of kings.

Then loudly cried the bold Sir Bedivere:
       Ah! my Lord Arthur, whither shall I go?
Where shall I hide my forehead and my eyes?
[Pg 211]For now I see the true old times are dead,
When every morning brought a noble chance,
And every chance brought out a noble knight.
Such times have been not since the light that led
The holy Elders with the gift of myrrh.
But now the whole Round Table is dissolved
Which was an image of the mighty world
And I, the last, go forth companionless,
And the days darken round me, and the years,
Among new men, strange faces, other minds.       

And slowly answer'd Arthur from the barge:
       The old order changeth, yielding place to new,
And God fulfils himself in many ways,
Lest one good custom should corrupt the world.
Comfort thyself: what comfort is in me?
I have lived my life, and that which I have done
May He within himself make pure! but thou,
If thou shouldst never see my face again,
Pray for my soul. More things are wrought by prayer
Than this world dreams of. Wherefore, let thy voice
Rise like a fountain for me night and day.
For what are men better than sheep or goats
That nourish a blind life within the brain,
If, knowing God, they lift not hands of prayer
Both for themselves and those who call them friend?
For so the whole round earth is every way
Bound by gold chains about the feet of God.
But now farewell. I am going a long way
With these thou seest       if indeed I go
(For all my mind is clouded with a doubt)       
To the island-valley of Avilion;
Where falls not hail, or rain, or any snow,
[Pg 212]Nor ever wind blows loudly; but it lies
Deep-meadow'd, happy, fair with orchard lawns
And bowery hollows crown'd with summer sea,
Where I will heal me of my grievous wound.       

So said he, and the barge with oar and sail
Moved from the brink, like some full-breasted swan
That, fluting a wild carol ere her death,
Ruffles her pure cold plume, and takes the flood
With swarthy webs. Long stood Sir Bedivere
Revolving many memories, till the hull
Look'd one black dot against the verge of dawn,
And on the mere the wailing died away.

But when that moan had past for evermore,
The stillness of the dead world's winter dawn
Amazed him, and he groan'd,        The King is gone.       
And therewithal came on him the weird rhyme,
       From the great deep to the great deep he goes.       

Whereat he slowly turn'd and slowly clomb
The last hard footstep of that iron crag;
Thence mark'd the black hull moving yet, and cried,
       He passes to be King among the dead,
And after healing of his grievous wound
He comes again; but       if he come no more       
O me, be yon dark Queens in yon black boat,
Who shriek'd and wail'd, the three whereat we gazed
On that high day, when, clothed with living light,
They stood before his throne in silence, friends
Of Arthur, who should help him at his need?       

[Pg 213]

Then from the dawn it seem'd there came, but faint,
As from beyond the limit of the world,
Like the last echo born of a great cry,
Sounds, as if some fair city were one voice
Around a king returning from his wars.

Thereat once more he moved about, and clomb
Ev'n to the highest he could climb, and saw,
Straining his eyes beneath an arch of hand,
Or thought he saw, the speck that bare the King,
Down that long water opening on the deep
Somewhere far off, pass on and on, and go
From less to less and vanish into light.
And the new sun rose bringing the new year.

THE GREAT KNIGHT SIEGFRIED
[Pg 214]

Once upon a time there lived in the Netherlands, in Xante,
a wonderful castle on the river Rhine, a mighty king and
queen. Siegmund and Sieglinde were their names, and far
and wide were they known. Yet their son, the glorious hero
Siegfried, was still more widely celebrated. Even as a boy
he performed so many daring feats that his bravery was talked
of in all German lands.

The two most remarkable of these feats were the slaying
of a frightful monster known as the        Dragon of the Linden-tree       
and the capture of the rich treasure of the Nibelungs.
The hoard was an ancient one and had this wonderful property       that
no matter how much was taken from it the quantity
was never less.

All this happened before Siegfried reached the age of manhood.
When it was time for the youth to be knighted, King
Siegmund sent invitations far and wide throughout the country,
and a great celebration took place. Siegfried was solemnly
girded with a sword and permitted to take his place among the
warriors of the kingdom. Then there was a great tournament,
a wonderful occasion for Siegfried, who came off victor in every
encounter, although many tried warriors matched their skill
against his. Altogether the festivities lasted seven whole
days.

After the guests had departed, Siegfried asked permission
of his parents to travel into Burgundy to seek as bride for
himself Kriemhild, the maiden of whose great beauty and
loveliness he had heard.

Gunther, the king of Burgundy, recognizing the young[Pg 215]
hero, went out to meet him and politely inquired the cause of
his visit. Imagine his dismay when Siegfried proposed a
single combat, in which the victor might claim the land and
allegiance of the vanquished. Neither Gunther nor any of
his knights would accept the challenge; but Gunther and his
brother hastened forward with proffers of unbounded hospitality.

Siegfried lingered a year in Gunther's palace, and though
he never caught a glimpse of the fair maid Kriemhild, she
often admired his strength and manly beauty from behind
the palace windows.

One day a herald arrived from King Ludeger of Saxony and
King Ludegast of Denmark, announcing an invasion. Gunther
was dismayed; but the brave Siegfried came to the rescue,
saying that if Gunther would give him only one thousand
brave men he would repel the enemy. This was done and the
little army marched into Saxony and routed the twenty
thousand valiant soldiers of the enemy's force. All the men
did brave work, but Siegfried was the bravest of them all.

When the hero returned, a great celebration was held in his
honor, and Kriemhild, Ute and all the ladies of the court were
invited to be present at the tournament. It was there that
Siegfried first saw the fair maiden. Her beauty was more
wonderful than he had ever been able to imagine. What was
his delight, then, to learn that he had been appointed her
escort.

On the way to the tournament Kriemhild murmured her
thanks for the good work Siegfried had done for her,
and Siegfried vowed that he would always serve her brothers
because of his great love for her.

Soon after the tournament Gunther announced his intention
of winning for his wife, Brunhild, the princess of Issland,
who had vowed to marry no man but the one who could surpass[Pg 216]
her in jumping, throwing a stone and casting a spear.
Gunther proposed that Siegfried go with him, promising him,
in return for his services, the hand of Kriemhild. Such an
offer was not to be despised, and Siegfried immediately consented;
advising Gunther to take only Hagen and Dankwart
with him.

Gunther and the three knights set out in a small vessel.
Siegfried bade his companions represent him as Gunther's
vassal only; but Brunhild, seeing his giant figure and guessing
its strength, imagined that he had come to woo her. She was
dismayed, therefore, when she heard that he had held the stirrup
for Gunther to dismount. When he entered her hall,
she advanced to meet him; but he drew aside, saying that
honor was due to his master Gunther.

Brunhild ordered preparations for the evening contest, and
Gunther, Hagen and Dankwart trembled when they saw four
men staggering under the weight of Brunhild's shield and
three more staggering under the weight of her spear. Siegfried,
meantime, had donned his magic cloud cloak and bade
Gunther rely upon his aid.

The combat opened. Brunhild poised her spear and flung
it with such force that both heroes staggered; but before she
could cry out her victory Siegfried had caught the spear and
flung it back with such violence that the princess fell and was
obliged to acknowledge defeat.

Undaunted, she caught up a huge stone, flung it far into the
distance, and then leaping, alighted beside it. No sooner had
she done this than Siegfried seized the stone, flung it still
farther, and lifting Gunther by his broad girdle bounded
through the air with him and alighted beyond the stone. Then
Brunhild knew that she had found her master.

       Come hither all my kinsmen and followers,        she said,
       and acknowledge my superior. I am no longer your mistress.
Gunther is your lord.       

[Pg 217]The wedding was fitly celebrated and then Gunther and
his bride were escorted back to Issland by a thousand Nibelung
warriors whom Siegfried had gathered for the purpose. A
great banquet was given upon their return, at which the impatient
Siegfried ventured to remind Gunther of his promise.
Brunhild protested that Gunther should not give his only sister
to a menial, but Gunther gave his consent and the marriage
took place immediately. The two bridal couples then sat side
by side. Kriemhild's face was very happy; Brunhild's was
dark and frowning.

You see, Brunhild was not pleased with the husband she
had gained and preferred Siegfried. Alone with her husband
the first night she bound him with her girdle and suspended
him from a corner of her apartment. There she let him hang
till morning. Released, Gunther sought out Siegfried and
told him of the disgraceful affair.

The following evening Siegfried again donned his cloud
cloak and entered the apartments of Gunther and Brunhild.
As he entered he blew out the lights, caught Brunhild's hands
and wrestled with her until she pleaded for mercy.

       Great king, forbear,        she said.        I will henceforth be thy
dutiful wife. I will do nothing to anger thee. Thou art my
lord and master.       

Having accomplished his purpose, Siegfried left the room,
but first he took Brunhild's girdle and her ring. These he
carried with him when after the festivities he and Kriemhild
returned to Xante on the Rhine.

Siegmund and Sieglinde abdicated in favor of their son, and
for ten years Siegfried and Kriemhild reigned happily. Then
they were invited to pay a visit to Gunther and Brunhild.
They accepted, leaving their little son Gunther in the care of
the Nibelungs.

Brunhild received Kriemhild graciously, but at heart she[Pg 218]
was jealous and wanted Kriemhild to acknowledge her as superior.
One day they had a hot dispute, Kriemhild declaring
that her husband was without peer in the world, and Brunhild
retorting that since he was Gunther's vassal he must be his
inferior. Kriemhild made an angry avowal that she would
publicly assert her rank.

Both queens parted in a rage and proceeded to attire themselves
in the most gorgeous costumes they possessed. Accompanied
by their ladies-in-waiting they met at the church door.
Brunhild bade Kriemhild stand aside while she entered, and
Kriemhild would not. A storm of words followed. Finally
Kriemhild insulted the other queen by declaring that Brunhild
was not a faithful wife.

       You loved Siegfried better than Gunther,        she declared.
       Here are your girdle and ring which my husband gave to
me.        So saying, she displayed the girdle and ring which
Siegfried had unwisely given her when he confided to her the
story of Gunther's wooing.

Brunhild summoned Gunther to defend her, and he sent for
Siegfried. The latter publicly swore that his wife had not told
the truth and that Brunhild had never loved him or he her.

       This quarrel is disgraceful,        he said.        I will teach my
wife better manners for the future.        Gunther promised to do
likewise.

The guests departed, but Brunhild still smarted from the
insult and longed for revenge. Hagen, finding her in tears,
undertook to avenge her. He continually reminded Gunther
of the insult his wife had received. The king at first paid no
attention to the insinuations, but at last he consented to an
assault on Siegfried.

He asked the great hero to help him in a war which he pretended
his old enemy Ludeger was about to bring upon him.
Siegfried consented, and Kriemhild, because she loved her[Pg 219]
husband very deeply, was much troubled. In her distress she
confided to Hagen that Siegfried was invulnerable except in
one spot, between the shoulder blades, where a lime leaf had
rested and the dragon's blood had not touched him.

       Never fear,        said Hagen,        I myself will help to protect
him. You sew a tiny cross on Siegfried's doublet, just over
the vulnerable spot, that I may be the better able to shield
him.       

Brunhild promised to obey his instructions, and Hagen
departed, well pleased, to carry the news to Gunther.

At last the day came for Siegfried to leave his queen. He
talked to her and comforted her and kissed her rosy lips.

       Dear heart,        he said,        why all these tears? I shall not
be gone long.       

But she was thinking of what she had told Hagen, and wept
and wept and would not be comforted.

When Siegfried joined Gunther's party he was surprised to
learn that the rebellion had been quelled and that he was
invited to join in a hunt instead of a fray.

So he joined the hunting party. Now Siegfried was as great
a hunter as he was a warrior, and while the noonday meal was
being prepared he scoured the forest, slew several wild boars,
caught a bear alive and in a spirit of mischief turned him loose
among the guests. Then, tired and thirsty, he sat down,
calling for a drink.

Not a bit of wine was at hand; it had all been carried to
another part of the forest. Hagen pointed out a spring near
by and Siegfried proposed a race, offering to run in full armor
while the others ran without armor or weapons. In spite of
the handicap, Siegfried reached the spring first.

Always polite, Siegfried bade his host, Gunther, drink first,
while he himself disarmed. Siegfried then stooped over the
spring to drink, and as he stooped, Hagen, gliding behind[Pg 220]
him, drove his spear into his body at the exact spot where
Kriemhild had embroidered the fatal mark.

Siegfried struggled to avenge himself, but found nothing
but his shield within reach. This he flung with such force at
his murderer that it knocked him down. Exhausted by the
effort, the hero fell back upon the grass, cursing the treachery
of Gunther and Hagen.

Curses soon gave way to thoughts of Kriemhild, however,
and overcoming his anger he recommended her to the care of
her brother Gunther. Then the great hero died.

The hunting party agreed to carry the body back to Worms
and say that they had found it in the forest. But Hagen,
bolder than the rest, ordered the bearers to deposit the corpse
at Kriemhild's door, where she would see it when she went
out for early mass the next morning. As he expected,
Kriemhild discovered her dead lord and fell senseless upon
him. Recovering, she cried out that he had been murdered:
no foeman in a fair fight could have killed the glorious knight.

A great funeral took place and Siegfried's body was laid in
state in the cathedral at Worms. Thither many came to view
it and to express their sympathy for the widow Kriemhild.
The latter, suspecting treachery, refused to listen to Gunther
until he promised that all of those present at the hunt should
touch the body.

       Blood will flow afresh at the murderer's touch,        he said.

One by one the hunters advanced, and when Hagen touched
the great warrior's form, lo, the blood flowed again from his
wounds. At this the Nibelung warriors wanted to avenge the
dead, but Kriemhild would not permit them to interrupt the
funeral. So the ceremonies were concluded and Siegfried's
body was laid to rest.

LOHENGRIN AND ELSA THE BEAUTIFUL
[Pg 221]

The young Duchess of Brabant, Elsa the Beautiful, had
gone into the woods hunting, and becoming separated from her
attendants, sat down to rest under a wide-branching linden-tree.

She was sorely troubled, for many lords and princes were
asking for her hand in marriage. More urgent than all the
others was the invincible hero, Count Telramund, her former
guardian, who since the death of her father had ruled over the
land with masterly hand. Now the duke, her father, on his
death-bed had promised Telramund that he might have Elsa
for wife, should she be willing; and Telramund was continually
reminding her of this. But Elsa blushed with shame at the
mere thought of such a union, for Telramund was a rough
warrior, as much hated for his cruelty as he was feared for his
strength. To make matters worse he was now at the court
of the chosen King Henry of Saxony, threatening her with war
and even worse calamities.

In the shade of the linden Elsa thought of all this, and
pitied her own loneliness in that no brother or friend stood
at her side to help her. Then the sweet singing of birds seemed
to comfort her, and she dropped into a gentle sleep. As she
dreamed it seemed to her that a young knight stepped out
of the depths of the forest. Holding up a small silver bell,
he spoke in friendly tones:

       If you should need my help, just ring this.       

Elsa tried to take the trinket, but she could neither rise nor
reach the outstretched hand. Then she awoke.

Thinking over the apparition Elsa noted a falcon circling[Pg 222]
over her head. It came nearer and finally settled on her
shoulder. Around his neck hung a bell exactly like that she
had seen in the dream. She loosened it, and as she did so
the bird rose and flew away. But she still held the little bell
in her hand, and in her soul was fresh hope and peace.

When she returned to the castle she found there a message,
bidding her appear before the king in Cologne on the Rhine.
Filled with confidence in the protection of higher powers, she
did not hesitate to obey. In gorgeous costume, with many
followers, she set out.

King Henry was a man who loved justice and exercised it,
but his kingdom was in constant danger from inroads by wild
Huns, and for this reason he wished to do whatever would
win the favor of the powerful Count Telramund. When,
however, he saw Elsa in all her beauty and innocence he
hesitated in his purpose.

The plaintiff brought forward three men who testified that
the duchess had entered into a secret union with one of her
vassals. Only two of these men were shown to be perfidious;
the testimony of the other seemed valid, though this was not
enough to condemn her.

Then Telramund seized his sword, crying out that God
Himself should be the judge, and that a duel should decide
the matter. So a duel was arranged to take place three
days later.

Elsa cast her eyes around the circle of nobles, but saw no
one grasp his sword in defense of her Innocence. Fear of the
mighty warrior Telramund filled them all.

Remembering the little bell, she drew it forth from her
pocket and rang it. The clear tones broke the stillness, grew
louder and louder until they reached even the distant mountains.

       My champion will appear in the contest,        she said; where-upon[Pg 223]
the count let forth such a mocking laugh that the hearts
of all were filled with intense fear.

The day of the contest was at hand. The king sat on his
high throne and watched the majestic river that sent its mighty
waters through the valley. Princes and brave knights were
gathered together. Before them stood Telramund, clad in
armor, and at his side the accused Elsa, adorned with every
grace that Nature can bestow.

Three times the mighty hero challenged some one to come
forward as a champion for the accused girl, but no one stirred.
Then arose from the Rhine the sound of sweet music; something
silvery gleamed in the distance, and as it came nearer
it was plain that it was a swan with silver feathers. With a
silver chain he was pulling a small ship, in which lay sleeping
a knight clad in bright armor.

When the bark landed, the knight awoke, rose, and blew
three times on a golden horn. This was the signal that he took
up the challenge. Quickly he strode into the lists.

       Your name and descent?        cried the herald.

       My name is Lohengrin,        answered the stranger,        my
origin royal: more it is not necessary to tell.       

       Enough,        broke in the king,        nobility is written on your
brow.       

Trumpets gave the signal for the fight to begin. Telramund's
strokes fell thick as hail, but suddenly the stranger
knight rose and with one fearful stroke split the count's helmet
and cut his head.

       God has decided,        cried the king.        His judgment is
right; but you, noble knight, will help us in the campaign
against the barbarian hordes and will be the leader of the
detachment which the fair duchess will send from Brabant.       

Gladly Lohengrin consented, and amid cries of delight
from the assembled people he rode over to Elsa, who greeted
him as her deliverer.

[Pg 224]Lohengrin escorted Elsa back to Brabant, and on the way
love awoke in their hearts, and they knew that they were
destined for each other. In the castle of Antwerp they were
pledged, and a few weeks later the marriage took place. As
the bridal couple were leaving the cathedral, Lohengrin said
to Elsa:

       One thing I must ask of you, and that is that you never
inquire concerning my origin, for in the hour that you put
that question must I surely part from you.       

It was not long after the ceremony that the cry to arms
came from King Henry, and Elsa accompanied her husband
and his troops to Cologne, where all the counts of the kingdom
were assembled. Here there were many inquiries concerning
Lohengrin, and when none seemed to know of his
origin, some jealously claimed that he was the son of a heathen
magician, and that he gained his victories by the power
of black arts.

Elsa, who had heard rumors of these charges, was deeply
grieved; for she knew the noble heart of her husband. He
had even relieved her fears for his safety by the assurance that
he was under the protection of powers higher than human.

But she could not banish the evil rumors from her mind,
and forgetting the warning her husband had given her on
the day of her marriage, she dropped to her knees and asked
him concerning his birth.

       Dear wife,        he cried in great distress,        now will I tell to
you and to the king and to all the assembled princes, what
up to this time I have kept secret; but know that the time of
our parting is at hand.       

Then the hero led his trembling wife before the king and
his nobles who were assembled on the banks of the Rhine.

Frithiof and Ingeborg in the Temple of Balder


[Pg 225]       The son of Parsifal am I,        he said,        the son of Parsifal,
the keeper of the Holy Grail. Gladly would I have helped
you, O King, in your fight against the barbarians, but an
unavoidable fate calls me away. You will, however, be
victorious, and under your descendants will Germany become
a powerful nation.       

When he finished speaking there was a deep silence, and
then, as upon his arrival, there rose the sound of music       not
joyful this time, but solemn, like a chant at the grave of the
dead. It came nearer and again the swan and the boat appeared.

       Farewell, dear one,        Lohengrin cried, folding his wife
in his arms.        Too dearly did I hold you and your pleasant
land of earth; now a higher duty calls me.       

Weeping, Elsa clung to him; but the swan song sounded
louder, like a warning. He tore himself free and stepped
into the boat. Was it the ship of death and destruction, or
only the ship that carried the blessed to the sacred place of
the Grail? No one knew.

Elsa, lonely and sad, did not live long after the separation.
Her only hope was that she would be reunited to her dear
husband; and she parted willingly with her own life, as other
children of earth have done when they have lost all that
they held most precious.

FRITHIOF THE BOLD
[Pg 226]

Frithiof was a Norwegian hero, grandson of Viking, who
was the largest and strongest man of his time. Viking had
sailed the sea in a dragon ship, meeting with many adventures,
and Thorsten, Frithiof's father, had likewise sailed abroad,
capturing many priceless treasures and making a great name
for himself.

Frithiof was entrusted to the care of Hilding, his foster
father, and in his care, also, were Halfdan and Helg        , King
B        l        's sons, and, some years later, their little sister, Ingeborg.
Frithiof and Ingeborg became firm friends, and as the lad
increased in bravery and strength, the girl increased in beauty
and loveliness of soul. Hilding, noticing how each day they
became fonder of each other, called Frithiof to him and bade
him remember that he was only a humble subject and could
never hope to wed Ingeborg, the king's only daughter, descended
from the great god Odin. The warning, however,
came too late, for Frithiof already loved the fair maiden,
and vowed that he would have her for his bride at any cost.

Soon after this the king died, leaving his kingdom to his
two sons and giving instructions that his funeral mound
should be erected in sight of that of his dear friend Thorsten,
so that their spirits might not be separated even in death.
Then Ingeborg went to live with her brothers, the Kings of
Sogn, while Frithiof retired to his own home at Framnas,
closed in by the mountains and the sea.

Frithiof was now one of the wealthiest and most envied
of land-owners. His treasures were richer by far than those
of any king.

[Pg 227]In the spring he held a great celebration, which the kings
of Sogn and their sister Ingeborg, among many other guests,
attended. Frithiof and Ingeborg were much together, and
Frithiof was very happy to learn that Ingeborg returned his
affection.

Great was his grief when the time came for her to sail away.
Not long had she been gone, however, when he vowed to
Bj      rn, his chief companion, that he would follow after her
and ask for her hand. His ship was prepared and soon he
touched the shore near the temple of the god Balder.

His request was not granted and Helg         dismissed him contemptuously.
In a rage at the insult Frithiof lifted his sword;
but remembering that he stood on consecrated ground near
B        l        's tomb, he spared the king, only cutting his heavy shield
in two to show the strength of his blade.

Soon after his departure another suitor, the aged King
Ring of Norway sought the hand of Ingeborg in marriage,
and being refused, collected an army and prepared to make
war on Helg         and Halfdan.

Then the two brothers were glad to send a messenger after
Frithiof, asking his aid. The hero, still angry, refused; but
he hastened at once to Ingeborg. He found her in tears at
the shrine of Balder, and although it was considered a sin
for a man and woman to exchange words in the sacred temple,
he spoke to her, again making known his love.

The kings, her brothers, were away at war, but Frithiof
stayed near Ingeborg, and when they returned, promised to
free them from the oppression of Sigurd Ring if in return
they would promise him the hand of their sister. But the
kings had heard of how Frithiof had spoken to Ingeborg in
the temple, and although they feared Sigurd they would not
grant the request. Instead he was condemned in punishment
to sail away to the Orkney Islands to claim tribute
from the king Angantyr.

[Pg 228]Frithiof departed in his ship Ellida, and Ingeborg stayed
behind, weeping bitterly. And as soon as the vessel was
out of sight the brothers sent for two witches       Heid and
Ham       bidding them stir up such a tempest on the sea that
even the god-given ship Ellida could not withstand its fury.

But no tempest could frighten the brave Frithiof. Singing
a cheery song he stood at the helm, caring nothing for
the waves that raged about the ship. He comforted his crew,
and then climbed the mast to keep a sharp lookout for
danger.

From there he spied a huge whale, upon which the two
witches were seated, delighted at the tempest they had stirred
up. Speaking to his good ship, which could both hear and
obey, he bade it run down the whale and the witches.

This Ellida did. Whale and witches sank; the sea grew
red with their blood; the waves were calmed. Again the
sun smiled over the hardy sailors. But many of the crew
were worn out by the battle with the elements and had to be
carried ashore by Frithiof and Bj      rn when they reached the
Orkney Islands.

Now the watchman at Angantyr's castle had reported the
ship and the gale, and Angantyr had declared that only
Frithiof and Ellida could weather such a storm. One of his
vassals, Atl        , caught up his weapons and hurried forth to
challenge the great hero.

Frithiof had no weapons, but with a turn of his wrist he
threw his opponent.

       Go and get your weapons,        Atl         said, when he saw that
Frithiof would have killed him.

Knowing that Atl         was a true soldier and would not run
away, Frithiof left him in search of his sword; but when he
returned and found his opponent calmly awaiting death,
he was generous, and bade him rise and live.[Pg 229]

Angantyr vowed that he owed no tribute to Helg        , and
would pay him none, but to Frithiof he gave a vast treasure,
telling him that he might dispose of it as he would.

So Frithiof sailed back to the kings of Sogn, confident
that he could win Ingeborg. What was his dismay, therefore,
to learn that Helg         and Halfdan had already given
their sister in marriage to Sigurd Ring. In a rage he bade
his men destroy all the vessels in the harbor, while he strode
toward the temple of Balder where Helg         and his wife were.
He flung Angantyr's purse of gold in Helg        's face, and seeing
the ring he had given to Ingeborg on the hand of Helg        's
wife snatched it roughly from her. In trying to get it back
she dropped the image of the god, which she had just been
anointing, into the fire. It was quickly consumed; while
the rising flames set fire to the temple.

Horror-stricken, Frithiof tried to stop the blaze, and when
he could not, hurried away to his ship.

So Frithiof became an exile, and a wanderer on the face of
the earth. For many years he lived the life of a pirate or
viking; exacting tribute from other ships or sacking them
if they would not pay tribute; for this occupation in the
days of Frithiof was considered wholly respectable. It was
followed again and again by the brave men of the North.

But Frithiof was often homesick, and longed to enter a
harbor, and lead again a life of peace.

At last he decided to visit the court of Sigurd Ring and
find out whether Ingeborg was really happy. Landing, he
wrapped himself in an old cloak and approached the court.
He found a seat on a bench near the door, as beggars usually
did; but when one insulting courtier mocked him he lifted
the offender in his mighty hand and swung him high over
his head.

At this Sigurd Ring invited the old man to remove his[Pg 230]
mantle and take a seat near him. With surprise Sigurd
and his courtiers saw step from the tattered mantle a handsome
warrior, richly clad; but only Ingeborg knew who he
was.

       Who are you who comes to us thus?        asked Sigurd Ring.

       I am Thiolf, a thief,        was the answer,        and I have grown
to manhood in the Land of Sorrow.       

Sigurd invited him to remain, and he soon became the
almost constant companion of the king and queen.

One spring day Sigurd and Frithiof had ridden away on a
hunting expedition and the old king being tired from the
chase lay down on the ground to rest, feigning sleep. The
birds and beasts of the forest drew near and whispered to
Frithiof that he should slay the king and have Ingeborg for
his own wife. But Frithiof was too fine and loyal to listen
to such suggestions.

Awaking, Sigurd Ring called Frithiof to him.

       You are Frithiof the Bold,        he said,        and from the first
I knew you. Be patient now a little longer and you shall
have Ingeborg, for my end is near.       

Soon after this Sigurd died, commending his wife to the
young hero's loving care. And at his own request the
funeral feast was closed by the public betrothal of Ingeborg
and Frithiof.

The people, admiring his bravery, wanted to make Frithiof
king, but he would not listen to their pleadings. Instead he
lifted the little son of Sigurd upon his shield.

       Behold your king,        he cried,        and until he is grown to
manhood I will stand beside him.       

So Frithiof married his beloved Ingeborg, and later, so the
story runs, he returned to his own country and built again the
temple of Balder, more beautiful by far than any before.

WAYLAND THE SMITH
[Pg 231]

King Nidung had one daughter and three sons. The oldest
son, Otvin, was away from court, guarding the outposts
of the country; the other two sons were still children.

One day the two boys came with their bows to the great
smith Wayland, asking him to make arrows for them.

       Not today,        the smith answered.        I have not time;
and besides, even though you are the sons of the king, I
may not work for you without the wish and consent of your
father. If he is willing, you may come again; but you
must promise to do exactly as I tell you.       

       What is that?        one of the boys ventured.

       You must,        said Wayland,        come on a day when snow has
freshly fallen, and you must walk facing backward all the
way.       

The children cared little whether they walked backward
or forward, as long as they got their arrows, and so they
promised. To their delight next morning they found that
snow had fallen. Quickly they set out for the smithy, walking
backward all the way.

       O Wayland, make us the arrows,        they cried.        The
king, our father, has said that we might have them.       

But Wayland had no intention of making the arrows, for
the king had treated him unjustly and cruelly, and he saw
the opportunity for revenge. With his mighty hammer he
struck the two children on the head and killed them. Then
he threw their bodies into a cave adjoining the smithy.

When the children did not return the castle messengers
were sent out to find them. They inquired at the smithy.

[Pg 232]       The boys have gone,        said Wayland.        I made arrows
for them, and no doubt they have gone into the woods to
shoot birds.       

Returning to the castle the messengers saw the footprints
in the snow, and since they pointed toward home, decided
that the children must have gone back. But they were not
there. Then Nidung sent his servants far and wide throughout
the country, and when the boys were nowhere to be
found, he concluded that they must have been devoured by
wild animals.

When all the searches were over, Wayland brought forth
the bodies of the two children, stripped the bones of flesh,
whitened them, and made them into goblets and vessels for
the king's table, mounting them with silver and gold. The
king was delighted with them, and had them placed upon
his board whenever there were guests of honor present.

A long time later, Badhild, the king's daughter, while
playing with her companions in the garden one day, broke
a costly ring that Nidung had given her. She was greatly
vexed and feared to tell her father.

       Why not take it to Wayland to mend?        suggested one of
her trusted maidens.

So Badhild gave the trinket to the girl and bade her take
it to Wayland. She brought it back with her.

       Without the command of the king he will not mend it,       
she said,        unless the king's daughter herself will come to
him.       

Badhild set out immediately for the smithy. There Wayland
substituted for her ring his own, which, had the curious
magic power of making its wearer fall in love with the smith.

The smith slipped the jewel on her finger, gazed into her
eyes and said,        This ring you shall keep as well as your own,
if you will be my bride.       



Wayland the Smith, wearing the wings he had fashioned






Zidovin threw the iron club into the air and caught it with one hand


[Pg 233]
The maiden could not refuse, and so the two were married,
agreeing to keep their union a secret.

About this time Eigil, the brother of Wayland, came to the
court of Nidung. He was a celebrated man and the most
skilful master of the bow to be found anywhere in the world.
The king welcomed him, and he remained a long time at the
court. One day Nidung proposed that, since he was such a
skilful bowman, he should try shooting an apple from the
head of his own son. Eigil agreed.

       You may have only one trial,        the king said.

So an apple was placed on the head of Eigil's three-year-old
son, and Eigil, taking his bow, aimed, and with the first
arrow struck the apple in the center, so that it fell from
the child's head.

       Why did you have three arrows?        the king asked.

       Sire,        replied Eigil,        I will not lie to you. If I had pierced
my son with the first arrow, the other two would have pierced
you.       

The king, strange to say, did not take offense at this speech,
but on the contrary showed Eigil still greater favor than he
had in the past.

The archer frequently visited his brother Wayland, but
Badhild came but seldom to her husband's house. One
day the two came together at Wayland's special request.
When they were leaving Wayland embraced Badhild and said
to her:

       You will be the mother of a boy       your child and mine.
It may be that I shall go away from here and never see his
face; but you must tell him that I have made for him worthy
weapons and stowed them in safety in the place where the
water enters and the wind goes out (the forge).       

The next time Wayland saw Eigil he bade him bring to
him all kinds of feathers, large and small.

[Pg 234]       I wish to make for myself a doublet of feathers,        he
explained.

Then Eigil shot many birds of prey and brought their
feathers to Wayland. From them he made a flying shirt,
clad in which he looked more like an eagle than a man.

Eigil admired the workmanship and Wayland asked him
to try it.

       How shall I rise, how fly, and how alight?        asked Eigil.

       You must rise against the wind, and fly first low and
then high, but you must alight with the wind.       

Eigil did as he was told, and had a good deal of trouble in
alighting. Finally he knocked his head with such force on
the ground that he lost consciousness. When he came to
himself Wayland spoke:

       Tell me, brother Eigil, do you like the shirt?       

       If it were as easy to alight as it is to fly,        was the answer,
       I should fly away and you would never see me again.       

       I will alter what is wrong,        said the smith, making a
slight change in the shirt. Then with Eigil's help he put on
the feathers, flapped his wings and rose into the air. He
lighted on a turret of the castle and called down to Eigil.

       I did not tell you the truth when I said that you should
alight with the wind, for I knew that if you found out how
easy it was to fly you would never give me the shirt back
again. You can see for yourself that all birds rise against
the wind and alight in the same way. I am going home to
my own country, but first I must have a few words with Nidung.
And, remember, if he bids you shoot me, shoot under
the left wing, for there I have fastened a bladder filled with
blood.       

With these words Wayland flew to the highest tower of the
king's castle and called to the king as he passed with his
courtiers.

[Pg 235]       Are you a bird, Wayland?        asked the king.

       Sometimes I am a bird and sometimes a man,        was the
reply;        but now I am going away from here and never again
will you have me in your power. Listen while I speak. You
promised once to give me your daughter and the half of your
kingdom, but you made of me instead an outcast       because
I defended myself and killed the wretches who would have
taken my life.

       You surprised me while I slept and stole my arms and my
treasures; and not satisfied with that you laid a net for my
feet and made of me a cripple. But I have had my revenge.
Do you know where your sons are?       

       My sons!        cried Nidung.        Oh, tell me what you know
of them.       

       I will tell you, but first you must swear to me by the
deck of the ship and the edge of the shield, by the back of
the horse and the blade of the sword that you will do no harm
to my wife and child.       

Nidung swore and Wayland began his speech:

       Go to my smithy, and there in the cave you will find
the remains of your sons. I killed them, and of their bones
made vessels for your table. Your daughter Badhild is my
wife. So have I repaid evil with evil, and our connection
is ended.       

With these words he flew away, while Nidung in great
anger cried:        Eigil, shoot at Wayland.       

       I cannot harm my own brother,        replied Eigil.

       Shoot,        cried the king,        or I will kill you.       

Then Eigil laid an arrow in his bow and shot Wayland as
he had been instructed, under his left arm, until the blood
flowed and everyone thought that the great smith had
received his death wound.

But Wayland, unharmed, flew away to Zealand and made
his home there in his father's land.

[Pg 236]Nidung, meantime, was sad and unhappy, and it was not
long before he died and Otvin, his son, succeeded to the throne.

Otvin was soon loved and honored throughout the kingdom
because of his great justice and kindness. His sister
lived with him at court, and there her son, Widge, was born.

One day Wayland sent messengers to Otvin, asking for
peace and pardon, and when these were granted he traveled
again to Jutland and was received with great honor.

The mighty smith was very glad to see his wife again and
very proud of his three-year-old son; but he would not yield
to Otvin's request that he remain in Jutland. Instead he
returned to Zealand with Badhild and Widge, and there they
lived happily for many years.

Wayland was known throughout all the world for his knowledge
and skill, and his son Widge was a powerful hero, whose
praises were much celebrated in song.

So ends the story of Wayland, the great smith of the
northern countries.

TWARDOWSKI, THE POLISH FAUST
[Pg 237]

Toward the close of the eighteenth century there was
pointed out to visitors in the old town of Krakau the house
of the magician Twardowski, who quite properly was called
the Faust of Poland, because of his dealings with the Evil
One.

In his youth Twardowski had followed the study of medicine,
and with such industry, such eagerness and such a clear
mind did he practice his profession that it was not long before
he was the most celebrated doctor in all Poland. But Twardowski
was not satisfied with this. He craved greater and
still greater power.

At last one day, as he was reading, he found in an old book
of magic that for which he had long been seeking       the formula
for summoning the devil. When night came a storm
had risen, but caring not for that he hurried away to the
lonely mountain Kremenki. There, in a rudely constructed
hut, he began his incantations.

Before long there was an earthquake; great rocks were
loosened, the ground opened at Twardowski's feet and flames
leaped out; and in the flames appeared the Evil One himself,
in the form of a man, clad in a red cloak with the well-known
pointed red cap.

       What do you wish?        the devil asked.

       The power of your most secret wisdom,        was the answer.

       And how is this to be done?       

       You shall make me the most celebrated of all the learned
men of the century, and shall besides give me such happiness
as no man has ever enjoyed upon this earth before.       

[Pg 238]       So be it,        said the devil.        But on condition that at
the end of seven years I gain possession of your soul.       

       You may take me,        answered Twardowski,        but only in
Rome may you have power over me. Thither, at the end of
seven years, will I go.       

The devil hesitated over this clause, but thinking of the
fun he could have in the holy city, finally agreed. Leaning
against the wall of stone he wrote the compact, which Twardowski,
making a slight wound in his arm, signed with his own
blood.

When Twardowski descended from the mountain and
made his way, book under arm, through the valley, he heard
the bells in all the towers of the city ringing out clearly and
solemnly on the still night air. He listened, wondering at the
unaccustomed noise, then hurried into the town, inquiring
from every one he met what the occasion was. But no one
seemed to have heard the sound.

Then a deep feeling of sadness came over him as he realized
the meaning of the bells. They were the funeral knell
of his own soul.

When morning came, however, doubts were forgotten, and
Twardowski was glad to have the devil at his command. The
first thing that he demanded was to have all the silver of
Poland gathered together in one place and covered over with
great mounds of sand.

Similar requests followed, and it was not long before the
devil repented of his bargain. One day it would please Twardowski
to fly without wings through the air; on another, to
the delight of the crowd, to gallop backward on a cock; on
another to float in a boat without a rudder or sail, accompanied
by some maiden who for the moment had inflamed
his heart. One day, by the use of his magic mirror, he set
fire to the castle of an enemy a mile away. This last feat
made him greatly feared by people far and wide.

[Pg 239]At last the seven years were up. The devil appeared to
Twardowski and said:

       Twardowski, the time of our pact is over, and I command
you to fulfill your promise and go to Rome.       

       What shall I do there?       

       Give me your immortal soul,        was the answer.

       Do you think I am a fool?        asked Twardowski.

       You gave me your promise to go to Rome after seven
years.       

       That I have already done,        said Twardowski,        and I
did not promise to stay in Rome.       

       Noble deceiver!        exclaimed the Evil One.

       Stupid devil!        cried Twardowski.

Then after a struggle the devil vanished and Twardowski
returned home.

For over a year he pored incessantly over his books of
magic, until at last he found a formula for warding off death.
Then he called his disciple Famulus to him and explained
that he was going to test the formula.

       You have always obliged me without question,        said
Twardowski,        and I expect you to now. Take this knife
and thrust it into my heart.       

       God forbid!        cried Famulus.

       Why are you frightened? I know what, I am doing.
Take the knife and kill me, as the parchment directs.       

       I cannot.       

       You must,        insisted Twardowski.

       It is impossible!       

       No more exclamations. Do as I tell you.       

       Oh, oh, oh!        wailed Famulus.

       Strike!        thundered Twardowski,        or I will kill you this
instant.       

Then Famulus did as he was bid and forced the blade
into his master's heart.

[Pg 240]Twardowski uttered a low cry, fell, and was soon dead.

Famulus dropped trembling into a chair and covered his
face with his hands. Then he remembered that he must
read the remainder of the parchment in order to find out
what he must do to restore the body to life.

Then he set about the task, severed the limbs of the dead
body; and worked and brewed and distilled until the elixir
described in the parchment was prepared.

With the elixir he rubbed the members of the master's
body, put them together, and laid the corpse in a coffin.
This he buried on the following night, explaining to Twardowski's
friends that such had been the master's wish.

Now the parchment stated that the body must remain
in the grave seven years, seven months, seven days and seven
hours; so Famulus could do nothing but wait. At last the
time had expired, and on a snowy, cold December night he
found his way to the grave. He dug out the coffin, brushed
off the snow and earth, opened the casket and found       not
the body of Twardowski, but that of a child who lay sleeping
in a bed of fragrant violets.

       The child is like Twardowski,        Famulus thought, and
he gathered him up under his cloak and carried him home.
The next morning the child was the size of a twelve-year
old; and after seven weeks he was a full-grown man.

Twardowski, who now seemed quite himself, only
younger and stronger, thanked Famulus and resumed again
his study of magic. He desired, above all things, to be freed
forever from his compact with the devil. This, he read in
one of the books, he might do if he would brave the terrors
of the underworld.

So Twardowski determined to enter the gates of hell.
At his magic speech the ground opened and he began the
path of descent. Blue flames lighted the way. Deeper and[Pg 241]
deeper he went through dark and winding passages. At
last he reached the underworld itself, and many awful sights
did he behold.

And the farther he went the more frightened did he
become. He could not help feeling that the devil had
plotted something against him. Finally he found himself
in a small room, and cast a hasty glance around, looking for
a means of escape.

Seeing a child in a cradle in one corner of the room he
seized it hastily, threw his cloak around it, and was about
to leave when the door opened and the Evil One entered.

He made a respectful bow and said,        Will you be good
enough to go with me now?       

       Why so?        asked Twardowski, obstinately.

       Because of our agreement.       

       But,        said the magician,        only in Rome have you power
over me.       

       Yes,        replied the devil,        and Rome is the name of this
house.       

       You think to trick me by a pun; but you cannot. I
carry this talisman of innocence,        and throwing aside his
cloak, he disclosed the sleeping child.

Anger showed in the face of the devil; but he stepped
nearer to Twardowski and said softly:

       What are you thinking of, Twardowski? Have you forgotten
your promise? The nobleman's word is sacred to
him.       

Pride awoke in the breast of the magician.

       I must keep my word,        he said, laying the child back
in the crib, and surrendering himself.

On the shoulders of the devil two wings appeared, like
the wings of a bat. He seized Twardowski and flew away
with him, mounting higher and higher into the night. The[Pg 242]
magician was so terrified and suffered such anguish in the
clutches of the Evil One that in a few moments he was changed
into an old man, but he did not lose consciousness. At last
so high were they that cities appeared like flies and Krakau
with its mighty turrets like two spiders. Deeply moved,
Twardowski looked down upon the scene of all his struggles
and all his joys.

But higher and higher they went       higher than any
eagle has ever flown       and more lonely and more fearful did
it seem to Twardowski. Only occasionally bright stars
passed by them, or fiery meteors, leaving a long streak of
light behind.

At last they came to the moon, which stared at them
with dead eyes. Then a song that Twardowski had read
in his mother's hymn book rose to his lips. And as he
repeated mechanically the prayer his mother had taught
him an angel suddenly appeared and said:

       Satan, let Twardowski go; and you, Twardowski, hang
you there between heaven and earth, to atone for your sin
until the Last Judgment. Then will you be reunited with
your mother in heaven. The prayer which you remembered
in your hour of need has saved you.       

And so, according to the story, Twardowski is suspended
in the vault of heaven to this very day.

ILIA MUROMEC OF RUSSIA
[Pg 243]

When we think of Russia we think of a great dark country       a
country of long winters and abundant snow and ice.
It was here, long ago, in the city of Kiev, that the hero
Ilia Muromec was born.

There was at that time a great castle in the city, and
this was well protected by Ilia Muromec and his twelve
armed knights. For thirty long years had they kept watch
at their post and no stranger had ever passed by them.

But one morning Dobrnja, the knight after Ilia Muromec
most powerful, perceived on the ground the imprint of a
horse's hoof. Then he said to the knights:

       Now is the mighty Zidovin in the neighborhood of our
castle. What is your will?       

The knights with one accord agreed that Dobrnja should
ride out against the stranger. So Dobrnja mounted his
war-horse and galloped forth to meet Zidovin, calling to
him in a deep, gruff voice:

       Here, my insolent sir, you have come all the way to our
castle and have omitted to send greeting to our captain
Ilia Muromec, or to inform him of your approach.       

When Zidovin heard these words he turned quickly and
rode toward Dobrnja with such force that springs and lakes
appeared wherever the hoofs of his black horse touched the
ground. And the trembling of the earth caused great waves
to rise on the sea.

Dobrnja was so frightened that he jerked his horse about
and with the swiftness of a cyclone galloped back to the
castle. When he entered, almost exhausted, he told in great
excitement of his encounter.

[Pg 244]Immediately Ilia decided to go forth himself against the
enemy, and all the entreaties of his knights could not restrain
him. So he rode out to a high point where he could see
Zidovin, watch him as he threw his hundred-weight club up
into the clouds, caught it with one hand, and swung it around
in the air as if it had been a feather.

Then Ilia spurred his horse and rode toward Zidovin. A
horrible fight ensued. Swords clashed and deep fissures
were made in the earth, but neither knight fell. It seemed
as if both heroes had grown fast to their saddles, so unshakable
were they.

At last they jumped from their horses and fought hand
to hand with lances. All day long and all night long they
struggled, until Ilia finally fell wounded to the ground.
Zidovin kneeled on his breast, drew out his sharp knife, and
was about to cut off the head of his enemy.

Ilia meantime was thinking,        Surely the holy fathers did
not lie to me when they said that I should not lose my life
in battle.       

Then suddenly he felt his strength redoubled, and he
hurled Zidovin from him with such force that his body
touched the clouds before it fell again in the moist earth
at his feet. Cutting off the warrior's head, he mounted his
horse and rode back to the castle. To his knights he said:

       Thirty years have I ridden in the field and thirty years
have I fought with heroes and tested my strength; but
such a mighty man as Zidovin have I in all that time never
met.

KRALEWITZ MARKO OF SERVIA
[Pg 245]

Kralewitz Marko was the son of a Servian king who lived
many, many years ago. He was very fond of hunting, and
one day he rode forth on his horse Saria to the mountain
Sargau. Being tired, he dismounted, tied his horse to a tree,
sat down in its shade and fell asleep.

And as he slept it happened that Arbanes Neda with his
seven brothers rode by. They all dismounted, lifted Kralewitz,
bound him to his horse, and rode away with him to
Jedrena, where they presented him to the vizier.

Highly pleased over the gift, the vizier took the king's
son and threw him into prison. Two long years Kralewitz
lay there, longing for liberty and home. Then he learned that
in a few days he was to be executed.

Immediately he wrote a letter to his friend, Milos Obilis,
asking for help. This important message he entrusted to his
only companion, a white falcon. Tying the letter under the
bird's wing he set it free.

The falcon easily found its way, alighted on Milos' window,
and was admitted. Scarcely had Milos read the letter, when
he and two of his friends were ready to set out for Jedrena.
They reached there the day before the execution.

In the morning the gate of the city was opened and Marko
was led out. Milos and his companions accompanied the
mournful procession to an open field in which the execution
was to take place. Two Arabs stood up with gleaming swords
prepared to cut off Marko's head.

       Hold on, brothers,        cried Milos.        I will give you a
sharper sword with which to cut off the malicious head of the[Pg 246]
noble Piam. See, with this sword did the good-for-nothing
treacherously slay my father. Cursed be his hand!       

With these words he rushed to Marko's side; then with one
swift stroke he cut off the head of one Arab, and with another
the head of the other.

With still another stroke he severed the chains that bound
Marko, and Marko, seizing a sword, swung himself into his
saddle, and with his friends began to attack the horde of
Turks. Frightened, the Turks fled before them, and Marko
and his companions returned to their own country.

Marko waited for and soon found the opportunity of showing
his gratitude to his friend, for Milos and two of his brothers
were thrown into prison in Varadin. Milos wrote with his own
blood a letter to Marko, asking for help.

Then the king's son sprang to his horse Saria and rode to
Varadin. Outside of the city he dismounted, stuck his spear
in the earth, tied Saria and began drinking the black wine
which he had brought with him. He poured it into huge
beakers, half of which, he drank himself, and half of which he
gave to Saria.

At the same time a beautiful maiden, the daughter-in-law
of the general, passed by. When she saw the king's son she
was frightened and ran and told her father-in-law.

Then the general sent out his son Velimir with three hundred
men to take Marko prisoner. The knights encircled Kralewitz
Marko, but he continued drinking his wine and paid no attention
to them. But Saria noticed them, and drawing near her
master began beating the ground with her hoofs.

At this Marko looked up and saw himself surrounded. He
emptied his beaker, threw it to the ground, and sprang to his
horse.

Like a falcon among doves Marko charged against the
enemy. He cut off the heads of some and drove the rest before[Pg 247]
him into the Danube. Velimir tried to flee, but Marko threw
him from his horse, tied his hands and feet and bound him to
Saria. Then again he began to drink his wine.

All this the maiden watched and reported to her father.
He gathered together three thousand knights and rode forth
against the stranger. They surrounded Marko, but he was
undismayed. Bravely he charged against them, his sword in
his right hand, his spear in his left, and the reins held between
his teeth.

Every knight he touched with either sword or spear fell
instantly to the ground, and when Vuca, the general, wholly
dismayed, tried to escape on his fiery Arabian horse, Marko
followed him, threw him, bound him, and led him to the place
where his son lay. Then he bound the two together, tossed
them on the saddle of the Arabian horse and rode home.
There he put them in prison.

Hearing this, the wife of the general wrote a letter to Marko,
begging for mercy for her husband and son. Marko promised
to release them on condition that she release Milos and his
brothers. This she did, honoring them and making them
rich presents.

       Now, for the love of Heaven,        said she,        see that my
husband and my son return to me.       

       Never fear,        answered Milos.        Give me the general's
black horse; adorn him as the general adorned him; give me
a golden chariot with twelve horses, such as the general rides
in when he journeys to the emperor in Vienna; and give me
the robe that the general wears on state occasions.       

The wife provided all that he asked, and gave the prisoners
for themselves a thousand ducats. Then they rode away.

Marko welcomed them, released the general and his son and
provided them with a strong body-guard back to Varadin. Then
Milos and his brothers divided the ducats among them, kissed the
hand of the king's son, and rode away into their own country.

THE DECISION OF LIBUSCHA
[Pg 248]

There dwelt once in the neighborhood of Gr      nberg Castle
in Bohemia two brothers       Staglow and Chrudis, of the distinguished
family of Klemowita       and these two had fallen
into a fierce dispute over the inheritance of their father's
lands. The older son Chrudis thought that he should inherit
all of the estate       and that is the custom in some countries,
you know       while the younger son, Staglow, declared that the
property should be equally divided.

Now it happened that a sister of the princess Libuscha
Vyched lived at the court. She entreated the princess to settle
the quarrel according to law.

The princess yielded to her wish, and decided that the
brothers should either inherit their father's estate jointly or
divide it into equal shares.

All the lords of the country assembled to hear the rendering
of the decision       brave knights from far and near. Chrudis
and Staglow, of course, were present, very curious to hear
what their princess would decide. Pungel of Hadio, proclaimed
far and wide as the bravest of all the knights of
Bohemia, was also among the company.

The princess herself rendered the decision, standing in white
robes before her people. The two brothers stood near, and
scarcely had the last word been uttered when the knight
Chrudis, who, as first-born, claimed the estate for himself,
sprang excitedly to his feet, mocking and insulting the princess.
       Poor people,        he said, addressing the assembly,        I am
sorry for you who have to be ruled over by a girl.       

Deeply grieved, the maiden-princess Libuscha rose, explaining[Pg 249]
that she would no longer rule alone. She commanded
the people to choose her a husband.

       No matter whom you choose,        she declared,        I will abide
by your decision.       

Thereupon the assembled subjects cried out that they would
have Pungel of Hadio as prince; and Libuscha, stepping
toward him, extended her hand to him in token of her agreement.

Thus did Pungel become the liege lord of the Bohemian
nobles.

No one knows how long ago all this happened, for the
manuscript that tells the story was very old when it was
discovered in the year 1817. It had lain for many, many
years among other old documents in the great chests that lined
the walls of the courtroom in the ancient Castle Gr      nberg
in Bohemia. The manuscript is now in a great museum in
Prague, and perhaps, some day, when you go there, you will
see it for yourself.

COUNT ROLAND OF FRANCE
[Pg 250]

The trumpets sounded and the army went on its way to
France. The next day King Charles called his lords together.
       You see,        said he,        these narrow passes. Whom shall I
place to command the rear-guard? Choose you a man yourselves.       

Said Ganelon,        Whom should we choose but my son-in-law,
Count Roland? You have no man in your host so
valiant. Of a truth he will be the salvation of France.       

The King said when he heard these words,        What ails
you, Ganelon? You look like to one possessed.       

When Count Roland knew what was proposed concerning
him, he spake out as a true knight should speak:        I am right
thankful to you, father-in-law, that you have caused me
to be put in this place. Of a truth the King of France shall
lose nothing by my means, neither charger, nor mule, nor
pack-horse, nor beast of burden.       

Then Roland turned to the King and said,        Give me twenty
thousand only, so they be men of valor, and I will keep the
passes in all safety. So long as I shall live, you need fear no
man.       

Then Roland mounted his horse. With him were Oliver,
his comrade, and Otho and Berenger, and Gerard of Roussillon,
an aged warrior, and others, men of renown. And Turpin
the Archbishop cried,        By my head, I will go also.        So they
chose twenty thousand warriors with whom to keep the passes.

Meanwhile King Charles had entered the valley of Roncesvalles.
High were the mountains on either side of the way,
and the valleys were gloomy and dark. But when the army[Pg 251]
had passed through the valley, they saw the fair land of
Gascony, and as they saw it they thought of their homes and
their wives and daughters. There was not one of them but
wept for very tenderness of heart. But of all that company
there was none sadder than the King himself, when he thought
how he had left his nephew Count Roland behind him in the
passes of Spain.

And now the Saracen King Marsilas began to gather his
army. He laid a strict command on all his nobles and chiefs
that they should bring with them to Saragossa as many men as
they could gather together. And when they were come to
the city, it being the third day from the issuing of the King's
command, they saluted the great image of Mahomet, the false
prophet, that stood on the topmost tower. This done they
went forth from the city gates. They made all haste, marching
across the mountains and valleys of Spain till they came in
sight of the standard of France, where Roland and Oliver and
the Twelve Peers were ranged in battle array.

The Saracen champions donned their coats of mail, of double
substance most of them, and they set upon their heads helmets
of Saragossa of well-tempered metal, and they girded themselves
with swords of Vienna. Fair were their shields to view;
their lances were from Valentia; their standards were of white,
blue, and red. Their mules they left with the servants, and,
mounting their chargers, so moved forwards. Fair was the
day and bright the sun, as their armor flashed in the light, and
the drums were beaten so loudly that the Frenchmen heard
the sound.

Said Oliver to Roland,        Comrade, methinks we shall
soon do battle with the Saracens.       

       God grant it,        answered Roland.        'Tis our duty to hold
the place for the King, and we will do it, come what may.
As for me, I will not set an ill example.       

[Pg 252]2Oliver climbed to the top of a hill; and saw from thence
the whole army of the heathen. He cried to Roland his
companion,        I see the flashing of arms. We men of France
shall have no small trouble therefrom. This is the doing
of Ganelon the traitor.       

       Be silent,        answered Roland,        till you shall know; say
no more about him.       

Oliver looked again from the hilltop, and saw how the
Saracens came on. So many there were that he could not
count their battalions. He descended to the plain with all
speed, and came to the array of the French, and said,        I have
seen more heathen than man ever yet saw together upon the
earth. There are a hundred thousand at the least. We shall
have such a battle with them as has never before been fought.
My brethren of France, quit you like men, be strong; stand
firm that you be not conquered.        And all the army shouted
with one voice,        Cursed be he that shall fly.       

Then Oliver turned to Roland, and said,        Sound your
horn; my friend, Charles will hear it, and will return.       

       I were a fool,        answered Roland,        so to do. Not so; but
I will deal these heathen some mighty blows with Durendal,
my sword. They have been ill-advised to venture into these
passes. I swear that they are condemned to death, one and
all.       

After a while, Oliver said again,        Friend Roland, sound your
horn of ivory. Then will the King return, and bring his
army with him, to our help.        But Roland answered again,
       I will not do dishonor to my kinsmen, or to the fair land of
France. I have my sword; that shall suffice for me. These
evil-minded heathen are gathered together against us to their
own hurt. Surely not one of them shall escape from death.       

       As for me,        said Oliver,        I see not where the dishonor
would be. I saw the valleys and the mountains covered with[Pg 253]
the great multitude of Saracens. Theirs is, in truth, a mighty
array, and we are but few.       

       So much the better,        answered Roland.        It makes
my courage grow. 'Tis better to die than to be disgraced.
And remember, the harder our blows the more the King will
love us.       

Roland was brave, but Oliver was wise.        Consider,       
he said,        comrade. These enemies are over-near to us,
and the King over-far. Were he here, we should not be in
danger; but there are some here today who will never fight
in another battle.       

Then Turpin the Archbishop struck spurs into his horse,
and rode to a hilltop. Then he turned to the men of France,
and spake:        Lords of France, King Charles has left us here;
our King he is, and it is our duty to die for him. Today our
Christian Faith is in peril: do ye fight for it. Fight ye must;
be sure of that, for there under your eyes are the Saracens.
Confess, therefore, your sins, and pray to God that He have
mercy upon you. And now for your soul's health I will give
you all absolution. If you die, you will be God's martyrs,
every one of you, and your places are ready for you in His
Paradise.       

Thereupon the men of France dismounted, and knelt upon
the ground, and the Archbishop blessed them in God's name.
       But look,        said he,        I set you a penance       smite these
pagans.        Then the men of France rose to their feet. They
had received absolution, and were set free from all their sins,
and the Archbishop had blessed them in the name of God.
After this they mounted their swift steeds, and clad themselves
in armor, and made themselves ready for the battle.

Said Roland to Oliver,        Brother, you know that it is Ganelon
who has betrayed us. Good store he has had of gold
and silver as a reward; 'tis the King Marsilas that has made[Pg 254]
merchandise of us, but verily it is with our swords that he
shall be paid.        So saying, he rode on to the pass, mounted
on his good steed Veillantif. His spear he held with the point
to the sky; a white flag it bore with fringes of gold which fell
down to his hands. A stalwart man was he, and his countenance
was fair and smiling. Behind him followed Oliver, his
friend; and the men of France pointed to him, saying,        See
our champion!        Pride was in his eye when he looked towards
the Saracens; but to the men of France his regard was all
sweetness and humility. Full courteously he spake to them:

       Ride not so fast, my lords,        he said;        verily these heathen
are come hither, seeking martyrdom. 'Tis a fair spoil that
we shall gather from them today. Never has King of France
gained any so rich.        And as he spake, the two hosts came
together.

Said Oliver,        You did not deem it fit, my lord, to sound
your horn. Therefore you lack the help which the King
would have sent. Not his the blame, for he knows nothing
of what has chanced. But do you, lords of France, charge
as fiercely as you may, and yield not one whit to the enemy.
Think upon these two things only       how to deal a straight
blow and to take it. And let us not forget King Charles'
cry of battle.       

Then all the men of France with one voice cried out,
       Mountjoy!        He that heard them so cry had never doubted
that they were men of valor. Proud was their array as they
rode on to battle, spurring their horses that they might speed
the more. And the Saracens, on their part, came forward
with a good heart. Thus did the Frenchmen and the heathen
meet in the shock of battle.

Full many of the heathen warriors fell that day. Not
one of the Twelve Peers of France but slew his man. But
of all none bore himself so valiantly as Roland. Many a[Pg 255]
blow did he deal to the enemy with his mighty spear, and when
the spear was shivered in his hand, fifteen warriors having
fallen before it, then he seized his good sword Durendal, and
smote man after man to the ground. Red was he with the
blood of his enemies, red was his hauberk, red his arms, red
his shoulders, aye, and the neck of his horse. Not one of
the Twelve lingered in the rear, or was slow to strike, but
Count Roland was the bravest of the brave.        Well done,
sons of France!        cried Turpin the Archbishop, when he saw
them lay on in such sort.

Next to Roland for valor and hardihood came Oliver, his
companion. Many a heathen warrior did he slay, till at last
his spear was shivered in his hand.        What are you doing,
comrade?        cried Roland, when he was aware of the mishap.
       A man wants no staff in such a battle as this. 'Tis the steel
and nothing else that he must have. Where is your sword
Hautclere, with its hilt of gold and its pommel of crystal?       

       On my word,        said Oliver,        I have not had time to draw
it; I was so busy with striking.        But as he spake he drew
the good sword from its scabbard, and smote a heathen knight,
Justin of the Iron Valley. A mighty blow it was, cleaving
the man in twain down to his saddle       aye, and the saddle
itself with its adorning of gold and jewels, and the very
backbone also of the steed whereon he rode, so that horse and
man fell dead together on the plains.        Well done!        cried
Roland;        you are a true brother of mine. 'Tis such strokes
as this that make the King love us.       

Nevertheless, for all the valor of Roland and his fellows
the battle went hard with the men of France. Many lances
were shivered, many flags torn, and many gallant youths cut
off in their prime. Never more would they see mother and
wife. It was an ill deed that the traitor Ganelon wrought when
he sold his fellows to King Marsilas!

[Pg 256]And now there befell a new trouble. King Almaris, with
a great host of heathen, coming by an unknown way, fell
upon the rear of the host where there was another pass.
Fiercely did the noble Walter that kept the same charge the
newcomers, but they overpowered him and his followers.
He was wounded with four several lances, and four times did
he swoon, so that at the last he was constrained to leave the
field of battle, that he might call the Count Roland to his aid.
But small was the aid which Roland could give him or any one.
Valiantly he held up the battle, and with him Oliver, and
Turpin the Archbishop, and others also; but the lines of the
men of France were broken, and their armor thrust through
and their spears shivered, and their flags trodden in the dust.
For all this they made such slaughter among the heathen that
King Almaris, who led the armies of the enemy, scarcely
could win back his way to his own people, wounded in four
places and sorely spent. A right good warrior was he; had
he but been a Christian, but few had matched him in battle.

Count Roland saw how grievously his people had suffered
and spake thus to Oliver his comrade:        Dear comrade, you
see how many brave men lie dead upon the ground. Well
may we mourn for fair France, widowed as she is of so many
valiant champions. But why is our King not here? O
Oliver, my brother, what shall we do to send him tidings of
our state?               I know not,        answered Oliver.        Only this
I know       that death is to be chosen rather than dishonor.       

After a while Roland said again,        I shall blow my horn;
King Charles will hear it, where he has encamped beyond the
passes, and he and his host will come back.       

       That would be ill done,        answered Oliver,        and shame
both you and your race. When I gave you this counsel you
would have none of it. Now I like it not. 'Tis not for a
brave man to sound the horn and cry for help now that we
are in such case.       



Roland's own death was very near





The youthful Cid avenging the death of his father


[Pg 257]
       The battle is too hard for us,        said Roland again,        and
I shall sound my horn, that the King may hear.       

And Oliver answered again,        When I gave you this
counsel, you scorned it. Now I myself like it not. 'Tis
true that had the King been here, we had not suffered this
loss. But the blame is not his. 'Tis your folly, Count
Roland, that has done to death all these men of France.
But for that we should have conquered in this battle, and
have taken and slain King Marsilas. But now we can do
nothing for France and the King. We can but die. Woe
is me for our country, aye, and for our friendship, which
will come to a grievous end this day.       

The Archbishop perceived that the two friends were at
variance, and spurred his horse till he came where they stood,
       Listen to me,        he said,        Sir Roland and Sir Oliver. I
implore you not to fall out with each other in this fashion.
We, sons of France, that are in this place, are of a truth condemned
to death, neither will the sounding of your horn
save us, for the King is far away, and cannot come in time.
Nevertheless, I hold it to be well that you should sound it.
When the King and his army shall come, they will find us
dead       that I know full well. But they will avenge us, so that
our enemies shall not go away rejoicing. And they will also
recover our bodies, and will carry them away for burial in
holy places, so that the dogs and wolves shall not devour
them.       

       You say well,        cried Roland, and he put his horn to
his lips, and gave so mighty a blast upon it, that the sound
was heard thirty leagues away. King Charles and his men
heard it, and the King said,        Our countrymen are fighting
with the enemy.        But Ganelon answered,        Sire, had any
but you so spoken, I had said that he spoke falsely.       

Then Roland blew his horn a second time; with great[Pg 258]
pain and anguish of body he blew it, and the red blood gushed
from his lips; but the sound was heard yet farther than at
first. Again the King heard it, and all his nobles, and all
his men.        That,        said he,        is Roland's horn; he never had
sounded it were he not in battle with the enemy.        But
Ganelon answered again:        Believe me, Sire, there is no battle.
You are an old man, and you have the fancies of a child.
You know what a mighty man of valor is this Roland. Think
you that any one would dare to attack him? No one, of a
truth. Ride on, Sire; why halt you here? The fair land of
France is yet far away.       

Roland blew his horn a third time, and when the King
heard it he said,        He that blew that horn drew a deep breath.       
And Duke Naymes cried out,        Roland is in trouble; on my
conscience he is fighting with the enemy. Some one has
betrayed him; 'tis he, I doubt not, that would deceive you
now. To arms, Sire! utter your war-cry, and help your
own house and your country. You have heard the cry of the
noble Roland.       

Then King Charles bade all the trumpets sound, and forthwith
all the men of France armed themselves, with helmets,
and hauberks, and swords with pommels of gold. Mighty were
their shields, and their lances strong, and the flags that they
carried were white and red and blue. And when they made
an end of their arming they rode back with all haste. There
was not one of them but said to his comrade,        If we find
Roland yet alive, what mighty strokes will we strike for him!       

But Ganelon the King handed over to the knaves of his
kitchen.        Take this traitor,        said he,        who has sold his
country.        Ill did Ganelon fare among them. They pulled
out his hair and his beard and smote him with their staves;
then they put a great chain, such as that with which a bear is
bound, about his neck, and made him fast to a pack-horse.

[Pg 259]This done, the King and his army hastened with all speed
to the help of Roland. In the van and the rear sounded the
trumpets as though they would answer Roland's horn. Full
of wrath was King Charles as he rode; full of wrath were all
the men of France. There was not one among them but
wept and sobbed; there was not one but prayed,        Now, may
God keep Roland alive till we come to the battle-field, so that
we may strike a blow for him.        Alas! it was all in vain;
they could not come in time for all their speed.

Count Roland looked round on the mountain-sides and on
the plains. Alas! how many noble sons of France he saw lying
dead upon them!        Dear friends,        he said, weeping as he
spoke,        may God have mercy on you and receive you into
His Paradise! More loyal followers have I never seen. How
is the fair land of France widowed of her bravest, and I can
give you no help. Oliver, dear comrade, we must not part.
If the enemy slay me not here, surely I shall be slain by sorrow.
Come then, let us smite these heathen.       

Thus did Roland again charge the enemy, his good sword
Durendal in his hand; as the stag flies before the hounds, so
did the heathen fly before Roland.        By my faith,        cried
the Archbishop when he saw him,        that is a right good knight!
Such courage, and such a steed, and such arms I love well to
see. If a man be not brave and a stout fighter, he had better
by far be a monk in some cloister where he may pray all day
long for our sins.       

Now the heathen, when they saw how few the Frenchmen
were, took fresh courage. And the Caliph, spurring his horse,
rode against Oliver and smote him in the middle of his back,
making his spear pass right through him.        That is a shrewd
blow,        he cried;        I have avenged my friends and countrymen
upon you.       

Then Oliver knew he was stricken to death, but he would[Pg 260]
not fall unavenged. With his great sword Hautclere he
smote the Caliph on his head and cleft it to the teeth.        Curse
on you, pagan. Neither your wife nor any woman in the land
of your birth shall boast that you have taken a penny's worth
from King Charles!        But to Roland he cried,        Come,
comrade, help me; well I know that we two shall part in great
sorrow this day.       

Roland came with all speed, and saw his friend, how he
lay all pale and fainting on the ground and how the blood
gushed in great streams from his wound.        I know not what
to do,        he cried.        This is an ill chance that has befallen you.
Truly France is bereaved of her bravest son.        So saying
he went near to swoon in the saddle as he sat. Then there
befell a strange thing. Oliver had lost so much of his blood
that he could not any more see clearly or know who it was that
was near him. So he raised up his arm and smote with all
his strength that yet remained to him on the helmet of Roland
his friend. The helmet he cleft in twain to the visor; but
by good fortune it wounded not the head.

Roland looked at him and said in a gentle voice,        Did
you this of set purpose? I am Roland your friend, and have
not harmed you.       

       Ah!        said Oliver,        I hear you speak, but I cannot see
you. Pardon me that I struck you; it was not done of set
purpose.       

       It harmed me not,        answered Roland;        with all my
heart and before God I forgive you.        And this was the way
these two friends parted at the last.

And now Oliver felt the pains of death come over him.
He could no longer see nor hear. Therefore he turned his
thoughts to making his peace with God, and clasping his hands
lifted them to heaven and made his confession.        O Lord,       
he said,        take me into Paradise. And do Thou bless King[Pg 261]
Charles and the sweet land of France.        And when he had
said thus he died. And Roland looked at him as he lay.
There was not upon earth a more sorrowful man than he.
       Dear comrade,        he said,        this is indeed an evil day. Many
a year have we two been together. Never have I done wrong
to you; never have you done wrong to me. How shall I
bear to live without you?        And he swooned where he sat
on his horse. But the stirrup held him up that he did not fall
to the ground.

When Roland came to himself he looked about him and
saw how great was the calamity that had befallen his army.
For now there were left alive to him two only, Turpin the
Archbishop and Walter of Hum. Walter had but that moment
come down from the hills where he had been fighting so fiercely
with the heathen that all his men were dead; now he cried
to Roland for help.        Noble Count, where are you? I am
Walter of Hum, and am not unworthy to be your friend. Help
me therefore. For see how my spear is broken and my shield
cleft in twain. My hauberk is in pieces, and my body sorely
wounded. I am about to die; but I have sold my life at a
great price.       

When Roland heard him cry he set spurs to his horse and
galloped to him.        Walter,        said he,        you are a brave warrior
and a trustworthy. Tell me now where are the thousand valiant
men whom you took from my army. They were right
good soldiers; and I am in sore need of them.       

       They are dead,        answered Walter;        you will see them
no more. A sore battle we had with the Saracens yonder on
the hills; they had the men of Canaan there and the men of
Armenia and the Giants; there were no better men in their
army than these. We dealt with them so that they will not
boast themselves of this day's work. But it cost us dear;
all the men of France lie dead on the plain, and I am wounded[Pg 262]
to the death. And now, Roland, blame me not that I fled;
for you are my lord, and all my trust is in you.       

       I blame you not,        said Roland,        only as long as you live
help me against the heathen.        And as he spake he took his
cloak and rent it into strips and bound up Walter's wounds
therewith. This done he and Walter and the Archbishop
set fiercely on the enemy. Five-and-twenty did Roland slay,
and Walter slew six, and the Archbishop five. Three valiant
men of war they were; fast and firm they stood one by the
other; hundreds there were of the heathen, but they dared
not come near to these three valiant champions of France.
They stood far off, and cast at the three spears and darts and
javelins and weapons of every kind. Walter of Hum was
slain forthwith; and the Archbishop's armor was broken,
and he wounded, and his horse slain under him. Nevertheless
he lifted himself from the ground, still keeping a good heart
in his breast.        They have not overcome me yet,        said he;
       as long as a good soldier lives, he does not yield.       

Roland took his horn once more and sounded it, for he
would know whether King Charles were coming. Ah me!
it was a feeble blast that he blew. But the King heard it,
and he halted and listened.        My lords!        said he,        things
go ill for us, I doubt not. Today we shall lose, I fear me
much, my brave nephew Roland. I know by the sound of his
horn that he has but a short time to live. Put your horses
to their full speed, if you would come in time to help him, and
let a blast be sounded by every trumpet that there is in the
army.        So all the trumpets in the host sounded a blast;
all the valleys and hills re-echoed with the sound; sore discouraged
were the heathen when they heard it.

       King Charles has come again,        they cried;        we are all as
dead men. When he comes he shall not find Roland alive.       
Then four hundred of them, the strongest and most valiant[Pg 263]
knights that were in the army of the heathen, gathered themselves
into one company, and made a yet fiercer assault on
Roland.

Roland saw them coming, and waited for them without
fear. So long as he lived he would not yield himself to the
enemy or give place to them.        Better death than flight,       
said he, as he mounted his good steed Veillantif, and rode
towards the enemy. And by his side went Turpin the Archbishop
on foot. Then said Roland to Turpin,        I am on horseback
and you are on foot. But let us keep together; never
will I leave you; we two will stand against these heathen dogs.
They have not, I warrant, among them such a sword as
Durendal.       

       Good,        answered the Archbishop.        Shame to the man
who does not smite his hardest. And though this be our
last battle, I know well that King Charles will take ample
vengeance for us.       

When the heathen saw these two stand together they
fell back in fear and hurled at them spears and darts and
javelins without number. Roland's shield they broke and
his hauberk; but him they hurt not; nevertheless they did
him a grievous injury, for they killed his good steed Veillantif.
Thirty wounds did Veillantif receive, and he fell dead under
his master. At last the Archbishop was stricken and Roland
stood alone, for the heathen had fled from his presence.

When Roland saw that the Archbishop was dead, his heart
was sorely troubled in him. Never did he feel a greater
sorrow for comrade slain, save Oliver only.        Charles of
France,        he said,        come as quickly as you may! Many a gallant
knight have you lost in Roncesvalles. But King Marsilas,
on his part, has lost his army. For one that has fallen on this
side there have fallen full forty on that.        So saying he turned
to the Archbishop; he crossed the dead man's hands upon his
breast and said,        I commit thee to the Father's mercy. Never[Pg 264]
has man served God with a better will, never since the beginning
of the world has there lived a sturdier champion of the
faith. May God be good to you and give you all good things!       

Now Roland felt that his own death was near at hand.
In one hand he took his horn, and in the other his good sword
Durendal, and made his way the distance of a furlong or so
till he came to a plain, and in the midst of the plain a little
hill. On the top of the hill in the shade of two fair trees
were four marble steps. There Roland fell in a swoon upon
the grass. There a certain Saracen spied him. The fellow
had feigned death, and had laid himself down among the slain,
having covered his body and his face with blood. When he
saw Roland, he raised himself from where he was lying among
the slain and ran to the place, and, being full of pride and fury,
seized the Count in his arms, crying aloud,        He is conquered,
he is conquered, he is conquered, the famous nephew of King
Charles! See, here is his sword; 'tis a noble spoil that I
shall carry back with me to Arabia.        Thereupon he took the
sword in one hand, with the other he laid hold of Roland's
beard.

But as the man laid hold, Roland came to himself,
and knew that some one was taking his sword from him.
He opened his eyes but not a word did he speak save this
only,        Fellow, you are none of ours,        and he smote him a
mighty blow upon his helmet. The steel he brake through
and the head beneath, and laid the man dead at his feet.
       Coward,        he said,        what made you so bold that you dared
lay hands on Roland? Whosoever knows him will think you
a fool for your deed.       

And now Roland knew that death was near at hand. He
raised himself and gathered all his strength together       ah me!
how pale his face was!       and took in his hand his good sword
Durendal. Before him was a great rock and on this in his[Pg 265]
rage and pain he smote ten mighty blows. Loud rang the
steel upon the stone; but it neither brake nor splintered.
       Help me,        he cried,        O Mary, our Lady! O my good sword,
my Durendal, what an evil lot is mine! In the day when I
must part with you, my power over you is lost. Many a
battle I have won with your help; and many a kingdom have I
conquered, that my lord Charles possesses this day. Never
has any one possessed you that would fly before another.
So long as I live, you shall not be taken from me, so long have
you been in the hands of a loyal knight.       

Then he smote a second time with the sword, this time
upon the marble steps. Loud rang the steel, but neither
brake nor splintered. Then Roland began to bemoan himself.
       O my good Durendal,        he said,        how bright and clear thou
art, shining as shines the sun! Well I mind me of the day
when a voice that seemed to come from heaven bade King
Charles give thee to a valiant captain; and forthwith the
good King girded it on my side. Many a land have I conquered
with thee for him, and now how great is my grief!
Can I die and leave thee to be handled by some heathen?       
And the third time he smote a rock with it. Loud rang the
steel, but it brake not, bounding back as though it would
rise to the sky. And when Count Roland saw that he could
not break the sword, he spake again but with more content
in his heart.        O Durendal,        he said,        a fair sword art thou,
and holy as fair. There are holy relics in thy hilt, relics of
St. Peter and St. Denis and St. Basil. These heathen shall
never possess thee; nor shalt thou be held but by a Christian
hand.       

And now Roland knew that death was very near to him.
He laid himself down with his head upon the grass, putting
under him his horn and his sword, with his face turned towards
the heathen foe. Ask you why he did so? To show, forsooth,[Pg 266]
to Charlemagne and the men of France that he died in the
midst of victory. This done, he made a loud confession of
his sins, stretching his hand to heaven,        Forgive me, Lord,       
he cried,        my sins, little and great, all that I have committed
since the day of my birth to this hour in which I am stricken
to death.        So he prayed; and, as he lay, he thought of
many things, of the countries which he had conquered, and of
his dear fatherland France, and of his kinsfolk, and of the
good King Charles. Nor, as he thought, could he keep himself
from sighs and tears; yet one thing he remembered beyond
all others       to pray for forgiveness of his sins.        O Lord,       
he said,        who art the God of truth, and didst save Daniel
Thy prophet from the lions, do Thou save my soul and defend
it against all perils!        So speaking he raised his right hand,
with the gauntlet yet upon it, to the sky, and his head fell
back upon his arm and the angels carried him to heaven.
So died the great Count Roland.

THE CID
[Pg 267]

Unlike some of the other heroes told about in this book,
the Cid was a real man, whose name was Rodrigo Diaz, or
Ruydiez. He was born in Burgos in the eleventh century
and won the name of        Cid,        which means        Conqueror,       
by defeating five Moorish kings. This happened after Spain
had been in the hands of the Arabs for more than three
hundred years, so it is small wonder that the Spaniards
looked upon their hero as a very remarkable man.

When Rodrigo was still a youth, his father, Diego Laynez,
was grossly insulted by Don Gomez. The custom in those
days was to avenge such an insult by slaying the offender;
but Diego was too old and feeble to bear arms. When he
finally told his son of the wrong, Rodrigo sought out Don
Gomez and challenged him to fight. So bravely and skilfully
did Rodrigo manage his weapons that he slew his
father's enemy. Then he cut off the head and carried it
to Diego.

Soon after this Diego bade his son do homage at King
Ferdinand's court. Rodrigo appeared before the king, but
his bearing was so defiant that Ferdinand was frightened,
and banished him.

Rodrigo departed with three hundred followers, encountered
some Moors, who were invading Castile, defeated them
and took five of their kings captive, releasing them only
after they had promised to pay tribute and to refrain from
further warfare. It was these kings who first called him
       Cid.       

In return for his brave service Rodrigo was restored to
favor and given place among the king's courtiers.

[Pg 268]One day Dona Ximena, daughter of Don Gomez, appeared
and demanded justice from the king. Recognizing Rodrigo
among the courtiers, she called to him to slay her also. But
both demand and cry were unheeded, for the king had been
too well served by Rodrigo to listen to any accusation
against him.

Three times the maiden returned with the same request,
and each time she came she heard greater praise of the
young hero. At last she decided to alter her demand. A
fourth time she returned, consenting to forego all thoughts
of vengeance if the king would order the young hero to marry
her. The Cid was very willing, for he had learned to love
the girl, admiring her beauty and spirit.

The marriage was celebrated with great pomp and the
king gave Rodrigo four cities as a marriage portion. Rodrigo,
vowing that he would not be worthy of his wife until
he had won five battles, after a pious pilgrimage to the shrine
of the patron saint, hastened off to Calahorra, a frontier town
claimed by two kings       the kings of Castile and Oregon.

It had been decided that the dispute over the town should
be settled by combat. Rodrigo became the champion of
Ferdinand of Castile. The other champion, Martin Gonzalez,
began, as soon as the combat opened, to taunt the
Cid.

       Never again will you mount your favorite steed Babie        a,       
he said,        never will you return to your castle; never will
you see your beloved Ximena again.       

But the Cid was undaunted, and had soon laid his enemy
low. Great praise then was given to the Cid       so great that
the knights of Castile were jealous and plotted to kill him.
But the Moorish kings whom he had captured and released
warned him in time to avert the danger.

Then the Cid aided Ferdinand in defeating the hostile[Pg 269]
Moors in Estremadura, after a siege of Coimbra lasting
seven months. Several other victories over his country's
enemies were added to this, and then Rodrigo returned to
his beloved wife.

But not for long was he permitted to remain in the quiet
of home. Henry III, Emperor of Germany, complained to
the Pope that King Ferdinand had refused to acknowledge
his superiority. The Pope sent a message to Ferdinand,
demanding homage and tribute. The demand angered both
Ferdinand and the Cid.

       Never yet have we done homage,        cried the Cid,        and
shall we now bow to a stranger?       

A proud refusal was then sent to the Pope, and he, knowing
of no better way to settle the dispute, bade Henry send
a champion to meet Rodrigo. The emperor's champion
was, of course, defeated, and all of Ferdinand's enemies were
so awed by the outcome of the fight that none ever again
demanded homage or tribute. Rodrigo was, indeed, a very
useful subject. When Ferdinand died, he was succeeded
by his son, Don Sancho. The latter, planning a visit to
Rome, selected the Cid to accompany him. Arriving, they
found that in the preparations that had been made for their
reception a lower seat had been prepared for Don Sancho
than for the King of France. The Cid would not suffer
such a slight, and became so violent that the Pope excommunicated
him. Nevertheless, the seats were made of equal
height, and the Cid, who was a good Catholic, humbled
himself before the Pope and was forgiven.

It was an age of great wars, and the Cid aided his king
in many a brave fight. At last, in the siege of Zamora, the
king was treacherously murdered, and, as he had no sons,
Don Alfonso, his brother, succeeded. When he arrived at
Zamora the Cid refused to acknowledge Alfonso until he should[Pg 270]
swear that he had no part in the murder. The king, angered
by the Cid's attitude, plotted revenge. Opportunity came
during a war with the Moors, and the Cid was banished
upon a slight pretext.

       I obey, O king,        replied the Cid, when he heard the
decree.        I am more ready to serve you than you are to
reward me. I pray that you may never more in battle
need the right arm and sword that so often served your
father.       

Then the Cid rode away, through a crowd of weeping
people, and camped outside of the city until he could make
definite plans. The people longed to bring him food or
offer him shelter, but they feared the displeasure of the
king. One old man, however, crept outside of the city with
food, declaring that he cared        not a fig        for Alfonso's
commands.

The Cid needed money, and to get it he pledged two locked
coffers to some Jews. The Jews in those days were much
despised by the Christians, though usually very wealthy.
The men, thinking that the boxes contained vast treasures,
when in reality they were filled with sand, advanced the
Cid 600 marks of gold. Then the hero bade farewell to his
wife and children and rode away, vowing that he would
return, covered with glory and carrying with him rich spoils.

Within two weeks' time the Cid and his little band of
followers had captured two Moorish strongholds and carried
off much spoil. The Cid then prepared a truly royal present
and sent it to the king. Alfonso, upon receiving the gift,
pardoned the Cid, and published an edict permitting all
who wished to join in the fight against the Moors to join
Rodrigo and his band.

Toledo, thanks to the valor of the Cid, soon fell into the
hands of Alfonso, but a misunderstanding arose and the[Pg 271]
king insulted the Cid. The latter, in great rage, left the
army and made a sudden raid on Castile. Then the Moors,
knowing that the Cid had departed, took courage and captured
Valencia. But the Cid, hearing of the disaster,
promptly returned, recaptured the city, and sent a message
to Alfonso asking for his wife and daughters. At the same
time he sent more than the promised sum of money to the
Jews, who up to this time had not learned that the coffers
were filled with sand. To the messenger he said:

       Tell them, that although they can find nothing in the
coffers but sand, they will find that the pure gold of my
truth lies beneath the sand.       

As the Cid was now master of Valencia, and of vast wealth,
his daughters were sought in marriage by many suitors,
and the marriage of both girls was celebrated with great
splendor. But the Counts of Carrion, their husbands, were
not brave men like the Cid, and after lingering at Valencia
in idleness for two years, their weakness was clearly shown.

One evening while the Cid was sleeping, a lion broke loose
from his private menagerie and entered the room where he
lay. The two princes, who were playing in the room, fled,
one in his haste falling into an empty vat, and the other
taking refuge behind the Cid's couch. The roaring of the
lion wakened the Cid, and jumping up he seized his sword,
caught the lion by the mane, led it back to its cage, and
calmly returned to his place.

The cowardly conduct of the Counts of Carrion roused
the anger of the Cid's followers, and in the siege of Valencia
that followed their conduct brought only contempt. When
the Moors were finally driven away the counts asked permission
to return home with their brides and gifts.

So the Cid parted from his daughters, weeping at the
loss. The procession started. The first morning the counts[Pg 272]
sent their escorts ahead, and, left alone with their wives,
stripped them of their garments, beat them and kicked them,
and left them for dead. But Felez Mu        oz, a loyal follower
of the Cid's, riding back, found the two wives, bound up
their wounds and obtained shelter for them in the house of
a poor man whose wife and daughters promised to nurse
them. Then he rode on to tell the Cid. The Cid swore that
he would be avenged, and as Alfonso was responsible for the
marriage, he applied to him for redress.

The king, who had long since forgiven the Cid and learned
to value his services, was very angry. A battle was finally
arranged. The Counts of Carrion and their uncle were
defeated and banished, and the Cid returned in triumph to
Valencia. Here his daughters' second marriage took place.

The Moors returned five years later, and the Cid was
prepared to meet them when he received a vision of St.
Peter, predicting that he would die within thirty days, but
that even though dead he would triumph over his enemy.
He accordingly made preparations for his death, and after
appointing a successor, he gave instructions that none should
weep over his death, and that his body when embalmed
should be set upon his horse, Babie        a, and that, with his
sword Tizona in his hand, he should be led on a certain day
against the enemy.

The hero died and his successor together with his wife
Ximena strove to carry out his instructions. A battle was
planned, and the Cid, strapped upon his war horse, rode in
the van. The Moors, filled with terror, fled before him.

After the victory the body was placed in the Church of
San Pedro de Carde        a, where for ten years it remained
seated, in plain view of all.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
