AND MYTHICAL SAND PAINTING<br>
OF THE NAVAJO INDIANS.</h3>

INTRODUCTION.</a></h4>


<p>During my visit to the Southwest, in the summer of 1885, it was my
good fortune to arrive at the Navajo Reservation a few days before the
commencement of a Navajo healing ceremonial. Learning of the preparation
for this, I&nbsp;decided to remain and observe the ceremony, which was
to continue nine days and nights. The occasion drew to the place some
1,200 Navajos. The scene of the assemblage was an extensive plateau near
the margin of Keam’s Canyon, Arizona.</p>

<p>A variety of singular and interesting occurrences attended this great
event&mdash;mythologic rites, gambling, horse and foot racing, general
merriment, and curing the sick, the latter being the prime cause of the
gathering. A&nbsp;man of distinction in the tribe was threatened with
loss of vision from inflammation of the eyes, having looked upon certain
masks with an irreligious heart. He was rich and had many wealthy
relations, hence the elaborateness of the ceremony of healing.
A&nbsp;celebrated theurgist was solicited to officiate, but much anxiety
was felt when it was learned that his wife was pregnant.
A&nbsp;superstition prevails among the Navajo that a man must not look
upon a sand painting when his wife is in a state of gestation, as it
would result in the loss of the life of the child. This medicine man,
however, came, feeling that he possessed ample power within himself to
avert such calamity by administering to the child immediately after its
birth a mixture in water of all the sands used in the painting. As I
have given but little time to the study of Navajo mythology, I&nbsp;can
but briefly mention such events as I witnessed, and record the myths
only so far as I was able to collect them hastily. I&nbsp;will first
describe the ceremony of Yebitchai and give then the myths (some
complete and others incomplete) explanatory of the gods and genii
figuring in the Hasjelti Dailjis (dance of Hasjelti) and in the nine
days’ ceremonial, and then others independent of these. The ceremony is
familiarly called among the tribe, “Yebitchai,” the word
<span class = "pagenum">236</span>
<a name = "page236" id = "page236"> </a>
<!--png 479-->
meaning the giant’s uncle. The name was originally given to the
ceremonial to awe the children who, on the eighth day of the ceremony,
are initiated into some of its mysteries and then for the first time are
informed that the characters appearing in the ceremony are not real
gods, but only their representatives. There is good reason for believing
that their ideas in regard to the sand paintings were obtained from the
Pueblo tribes, who in the past had elaborated sand paintings and whose
work at present in connection with most of their medicine ceremonies is
of no mean order. The Mission Indians of southern California also regard
sand paintings as among the important features in their medicine
practices. While the figures of the mythical beings represented by the
Navajo are no doubt of their own conception, yet I discovered that all
their medicine tubes and offerings were similar to those in use by the
Zuñi. Their presence among the Navajo can be readily explained by the
well known fact that it was the custom among Indians of different tribes
to barter and exchange medicine songs, ceremonies, and the paraphernalia
accompanying them. The Zuñi and Tusayan claim that the Navajo obtained
the secrets of the Pueblo medicine by intruding upon their ceremonials
or capturing a pueblo, and that they appropriated whatever suited their
fancy.</p>

Exterior lodge.</p>

<p>My explanation of the ceremonial described is by authority of the
priest doctor who managed the whole affair and who remained with me five
days after the ceremonial for this special purpose. Much persuasion was
required to induce him to stay, though he was most anxious that we
should make no mistake. He said:</p>

<blockquote>
My wife may suffer and I should be near her; a&nbsp;father’s eyes
should be the first to look upon his child; it is like sunshine in
the father’s heart; the father also watches his little one to see
the first signs of understanding, and observes the first steps of
his child, that too is a bright light in the father’s heart, but
when the little one falls, it strikes the father’s heart hard.
</blockquote>

<p>The features of this ceremonial which most surprise the white
spectator are its great elaborateness, the number of its participants
and its prolongation through many days for the purpose of restoring
health to a single member of the tribe.</p>

CONSTRUCTION OF THE MEDICINE LODGE.</a></h4>


<p>A rectangular parallelogram was marked off on the ground, and at each
corner was firmly planted a forked post extending 10 feet above the
surface, and on these were laid 4 horizontal beams, against which rested
poles thickly set at an angle of about 20°, while other poles were
placed horizontally across the beams forming a support for the covering.
The poles around the sides were planted more in an oval than a circle
and formed an interior space of about 35 by 30 feet in diameter. On the
east side of the lodge was an entrance supported by stakes and closed
with a buffalo robe, and the whole structure was then thickly covered
first with boughs, then with sand, giving it the appearance of a small
earth mound.</p>

PERSONATORS OF THE GODS.</a></h5>

<p>The theurgist or song-priest arrived at noon on the 12th of October,
1885. Almost immediately after his arrival we boldly entered the
medicine lodge, accompanied by our interpreter, Navajo John, and pleaded
our cause. The stipulation of the medicine man was that we should make
no mistakes and thereby offend the gods, and to avoid mistakes we must
hear all of his songs and see all of his medicines, and he at once
ordered some youths to prepare a place for our tent near the lodge.
During the afternoon of the 12th those who were to take part in the
ceremonial received orders and instructions from the song-priest. One
man went to collect twigs with which to make twelve rings, each 6
<span class = "pagenum">238</span>
<a name = "page238" id = "page238"> </a>
<!--png 481-->
inches in diameter. These rings represented gaming rings, which are not
only used by the Navajo, but are thought highly of by the genii of the
rocks. (See Fig. 117.)

</span>
Another man gathered willows with which to make the emblem of the
concentration of the four winds. The square was made by dressed willows
crossed and left projecting at the corners each one inch beyond the
next. The corners were tied together with white cotton cord, and each
corner was ornamented with the under tail feather of the eagle. These
articles were laid in a niche behind the theurgist, whose permanent seat
was on the west side of the lodge facing east. The night ceremony
commenced shortly after dark. All those who were to participate were
immediate friends and relatives of the invalid excepting the theurgist
or song-priest, he being the only one who received direct compensation
for his professional services. The cost of such a ceremony is no
inconsiderable item. Not only the exorbitant fee of the theurgist must
be paid, but the entire assemblage must be fed during the nine days’
ceremonial at the expense of the invalid, assisted by his near
relatives.</p>

<p>A bright fire burned in the lodge, and shortly after dark the invalid
appeared and sat upon a blanket, which was placed in front of the
song-priest. Previously, however, three men had prepared themselves to
personate the gods&mdash;Hasjelti, Hostjoghon, and Hostjobokon&mdash;and
one to personate the goddess, Hostjoboard. They left the lodge, carrying
their masks in their hands, went a short distance away and put on their
masks. Then Hasjelti and Hostjoghon returned to the lodge, and Hasjelti,
amid hoots, “hu-hoo-hu-huh!” placed the square which he carried over the
invalid’s head, and Hostjoghon shook two eagle wands, one in each hand,
on each side of the invalid’s head and body, then over his head,
meanwhile hooting in his peculiar way, “hu-u-u-u-uh!” He then followed
Hasjelti out of the lodge. The men representing Hostjobokon and
Hostjoboard came in alternately. Hostjobokon took one of the rings which
had been made during the afternoon, and now lay upon the blanket to the
right of the invalid, and placed it against the soles of the feet of the
invalid, who was sitting with knees drawn up, and then against his
knees, palms, breast, each scapula, and top of his head; then over his
mouth. While touching the different parts of the body the ring was held
with both hands, but when placed to the mouth of the invalid it was
taken in the left hand. The ring was made of a reed, the ends of which
were secured by a long string wrapped over the ring like a slipnoose.
When the ring was placed over the mouth of the invalid the string was
pulled and the ring dropped and rolled out of the lodge, the long tail
of white cotton yarn, with eagle plume attached to the end, extending
far behind. Hostjoboard repeated this ceremony
<span class = "pagenum">239</span>
<a name = "page239" id = "page239"> </a>
<!--png 482-->
with a second ring, and so did Hostjobokon and Hostjoboard alternately,
until the twelve rings were disposed of. Three of the rings were
afterward taken to the east, three to the south, three to the west, and
three to the north, and deposited at the base of piñon trees. The rings
were placed over the invalid’s mouth to give him strength, cause him to
talk with one tongue, and to have a good mind and heart. The other
portions of the body were touched with them for physical benefit. When
the rings had all been rolled out of the lodge Hasjelti entered,
followed by Hostjoghon. He passed the square (the concentrated winds)
four times over the head of the invalid during his hoots. Hostjoghon
then waved his turkey wands about the head and body of the invalid, and
the first day’s ceremony was at an end.</p>

SECOND DAY.</a></h4>


<h5 class = "section"><a name = "day2_desc" id = "day2_desc">
DESCRIPTION OF THE SWEAT HOUSES.</a></h5>

<p>The construction of the first sweat house, or tachi, was begun at
dawn. Four of these houses were built on four consecutive mornings, each
one located about 400 feet distant from the great central medicine
lodge, toward the four cardinal points, and all facing to the east. The
first one built was east of the lodge. A&nbsp;description of the
construction of this particular one will answer for all, but the
ceremonies differ in detail.</p>

<p>Four upright poles, forked at the upper ends, were placed at the four
cardinal points within an area designated as the base of the house, the
forked ends resting against each other, a&nbsp;circular excavation some
6 feet in diameter and 1 foot in depth having first been made. Between
the uprights smaller poles were laid; on the poles piñon boughs, sage
and <i>Bigelovia Douglasii</i> (a&nbsp;kind of sage brush) were placed
as a thatch; all being laid sufficiently compact to prevent the sand
placed over the top from sifting through. The doorway, on the east side
of the house, was about 2½ feet high and 20 inches wide. Highly polished
sticks (the same as those employed in blanket weaving) were used to
render the sand covering of the structure smooth. The sweat houses to
the east and west had the rainbow painted over them. Those to the north
and south were devoid of such decoration, because the song priest seldom
completes his medicine in one ceremonial; and he chose to omit the songs
which would be required if the bow ornamented the north and south sweat
houses. Under the direction of the priest of the sweat house, who
received instruction from the song priest, three young men painted the
rainbow, one the head and body, another the skirt and legs, while the
third painted the bow. The head of this goddess was to the north, the
bow extending over the structure. The colors used were made from ground
pigments sprinkled on with the thumb and forefinger. Whenever a pinch of
the dry paint was taken from the pieces of bark which served as paint
cups, the artist breathed upon the hand before
<span class = "pagenum">240</span>
<a name = "page240" id = "page240"> </a>
<!--png 483-->
sprinkling the paint. This, however, had no religious significance, but
was merely to clear the finger and thumb of any superfluous sand. The
colors used in decoration were yellow, red, and white from sandstones,
black from charcoal, and a grayish blue, formed of white sand and
charcoal, with a very small quantity of yellow and red sands. (See Fig.
118.) The decorators were carefully watched by the song priest.</p>

Sweat house.</p>

<p>Upon the completion of the rainbow the song priest returned to the
medicine lodge, but soon reappeared bearing a basket of twelve turkey
wands, and these he planted around the base of the sweat house on a line
of meal he had previously sprinkled. There was a fire some 20 feet from
the house, in which stones were heated. These stones were placed in the
sweat house on the south side, and upon them was thrown an armful of
white sage and <i>Bigelovia Douglasii</i>. A&nbsp;few pine boughs were
laid by the side of the stones for the invalid to sit upon. The entrance
to the sweat house was then covered with a black and white striped
blanket upon which were placed two large Coçonino buckskins one upon the
other, and upon them a double piece of white cotton. The buckskins
represented daylight, or the twilight that comes just at the dawn of
day. The invalid for whom this ceremony was held took off all his
clothing except the breech cloth, and sat on the outside by the entrance
of the sweat house amid the din of rattle and song, the theurgist being
the only one who had a rattle. The invalid propelled himself into the
house feet foremost, the covering of the sweat house having been raised
for this purpose. After entering it, he rid himself of his breechcloth
and the coverings were immediately dropped. The song continued 5
minutes, when all stopped for a moment and then recommenced.</p>

During the song the theurgist mixed various herbs in a gourd over which
he poured water. After chanting some twenty minutes he advanced to the
entrance of the house, taking the medicine gourd with him, and, after
pouring some of its contents on the heated stones, took his seat and
joined in the chanting. After another twenty minutes Hasjelti and
Hostjoghon appeared. A&nbsp;Navajo blanket had previously been placed on
the ground at the south side of the entrance. Hasjelti lifted the
coverings from the entrance, and the patient, having first donned his
breech cloth, came out and sat on the blanket. Hasjelti rubbed the
invalid with the horn of a mountain sheep held in the left hand, and in
the right hand a piece of hide, about 10 inches long and 4 wide, from
between the eyes of the sheep. The hide was held flatly against the palm
of the hand, and in this way the god rubbed the breast of the invalid,
while he rubbed his back with the horn, occasionally alternating his
hands. Hostjoghon put the invalid through the same manipulation. The
gods then gave him drink four times from the gourd containing medicine
water composed of finely-chopped herbs and water, they having first
taken a draught of the mixture. The soles of the feet, palms, breast,
back, shoulders, and top of the head of the invalid were touched with
medicine water, and the gods suddenly disappeared. The patient arose and
bathed himself with the remainder of the medicine water and put on his
clothing. The coverings of the entrance, which were gifts to the song
priest from the invalid, were gathered together by the song priest and
carried by an attendant to the medicine lodge. An attendant erased the
rainbow by sweeping his hand from the feet to the head, drawing the
sands with him, which were gathered into a blanket and carried to the
north and deposited at the base of a piñon tree. The song priest placed
the wands in a basket, and thus, preceded by the invalid, carried them
in both hands to the medicine lodge singing a low chant. The sweat house
was not carelessly torn down, but was taken down after a prescribed
form. Four men commenced at the sides toward the cardinal points, and
with both hands scraped the sand from the boughs. When this was all
removed the boughs were carefully gathered and conveyed to a piñon tree
some 50 feet distant and fastened horizontally in its branches about 2
feet above the ground. The heated stones from the interior of the sweat
house were laid on the boughs; the upright logs which formed the frame
work of the house were carried to a piñon tree, a&nbsp;few feet from the
tree in which the boughs and heated stones were placed, and arranged
crosswise in the tree, and on these logs corn meal was sprinkled and on
the meal a medicine tube (cigarette) was deposited. The tube was about 2
inches long and one third of an inch in diameter, and it contained a
ball composed of down from several varieties of small birds, sacred
tobacco, and corn pollen. It was an offering to Hasjelti. Meal was
sprinkled on the tube. The ground on which the house had stood was
smoothed over, the ashes from the fire carefully swept away, and thus
all traces of the ceremony

were removed. The invalid upon entering the lodge took his seat on the
west side facing east. The song priest continued his chant. He took from
the meal bag some sacred meal and placed it to the soles of the feet of
the invalid and on his palms, knees, breast, back, shoulders, and head.
At the conclusion of this ceremony all indulged in a rest for an hour or
more. The bark cups which contained the colored sands for decorating
were placed in the medicine lodge north of the door.</p>

SWEAT HOUSES AND MASKS.</a></h5>

<p>The deer skins which hang over the entrance of the sweat houses
(a&nbsp;different skin being used for each sweat house) must be from
animals which have been killed by being smothered. The deer is run down
and secured by ropes or otherwise. Corn pollen is then put into the
mouth of the deer and the hands are held over the mouth and nostrils
until life is extinct. The animal now being placed upon his back,
a&nbsp;line is drawn with corn pollen, over the mouth, down the breast
and belly to the tail. The line is then drawn from the right hoof to the
right foreleg to the breast line. The same is done on the left fore leg
and the two hind legs. The knife is then passed over this line and the
deer is flayed. Skins procured in this way are worth, among the Navajo,
$50 each. Masks are made of skins prepared in the same manner. If made
of skins of deer that have been shot the wearer would die of fever.</p>

<p>Buckskin over the entrance to an eastern sweat house denotes dawn;
over a southern, denotes red of morning; over a western, sunset; over a
northern, night.</p>

PREPARATION OF THE SACRED REEDS (CIGARETTE) AND PRAYER STICKS.</a></h5>

<p>Before noon two sheepskins were spread one upon the other before the
song-priest. Upon these was laid a blanket, and on the blanket pieces of
cotton. These rugs extended north and south. The theurgist then produced
a large medicine bag, from which a reed was selected. The reed was
rubbed with a polishing stone, or, more accurately speaking, the
polishing stone was rubbed with the reed, as the reed was held in the
right hand and rubbed against the stone, which was held in the left. It
was then rubbed with finely broken native tobacco, and afterwards was
divided into four pieces, the length of each piece being equal to the
width of the first three fingers. The reeds were cut with a stone knife
some 3½ inches long. An attendant then colored the tubes. The first reed
was painted blue, the second black, the third blue, and the fourth
black. Through all these, slender sticks of yucca had been run to serve
as handles while painting the tubes and also to support the tubes while
the paint was drying. The attendant who cut the reeds sat left of the
song-priest, facing east; a&nbsp;stone containing the paints was placed
to the north of the rug; and upon the end of the stone next to

himself the reed-cutter deposited a bit of finely broken tobacco. In
cutting the reeds occasionally a bit splintered off; these scraps were
placed by the side of the tobacco on the northeast end of the rug.</p>

BLANKET RUG AND MEDICINE TUBES.<br>
<a href = "../images/plates/plate113large.jpg" target = "_blank">Larger
View</a></p>

<p>The attendant who colored the reeds sat facing west; and as each reed
was colored it was placed on the rug, the yucca end being laid on a
slender stick which ran horizontally. The first reed painted was laid to
the north. Three dots were put upon each blue reed to represent eyes and
mouth; two lines encircled the black reeds. Four bits of soiled cotton
cloth were deposited in line on the east of the rug. The three
attendants under the direction of the song-priest took from the medicine
bag, first two feathers from the Arctic blue bird (<i>Sialia
arctica</i>), which he placed west of the bit of cloth that lay at the
north end of the rug; he placed two more of the same feathers below the
second piece of cloth; two under the third, and two below the fourth,
their tips pointing east. Then upon each of these feathers he placed an
under tail-feather of the eagle. The first one was laid on the two
feathers at the north end of the rug; again an under tail-feather of the
turkey was placed on each pile, beginning with that of the north. Then
upon each of these was placed a hair from the beard of the turkey, and
to each was added a thread of cotton yarn. During the arrangement of the
feathers the tube decorator first selected four bits of black archaic
beads, placing a piece on each bit of cloth; then four tiny pieces of
white shell beads were laid on the cloths; next four pieces of abalone
shell and four pieces of turquois.</p>

<p>In placing the beads he also began at the north end of the rug. An
aged attendant, under the direction of the song-priest, plucked downy
feathers from several humming-birds and mixed them together into four
little balls one-fourth of an inch in diameter and placed them in line
running north and south, and south of the line of plume piles. He
sprinkled a bit of corn pollen upon each ball; he then placed what the
Navajo term a night-owl feather under the balls with its tip pointing to
the northeast. (See <a href = "#plateCXIII">Pl. <span class =
"smallroman">CXIII</span></a>). The young man facing west then filled
the colored reeds, beginning with the one on the north end. He put into
the hollow reed, first, one of the feather balls, forcing it into the
reed with the quill end of the night-owl feather. (A&nbsp;night-owl
feather is always used for filling the reeds after the corn is ripe to
insure a warm winter; in the spring a plume from the chaparral cock,
<i>Geococcyx californianus</i>, is used instead to bring rain). Then a
bit of native tobacco was put in. When the reed was thus far completed
it was passed to the decorator, who had before him a tiny earthen bowl
of water, a&nbsp;crystal, and a small pouch of corn pollen. Holding the
crystal in the sunbeam which penetrated through the fire opening in the
roof, he thus lighted the cigarettes which were to be offered to the
gods. The forefinger was dipped into the bowl of water and then into the
corn pollen, and the pollen that adhered to the finger was placed to the
top of the tube. After the four tubes were finished they were placed on
the
<span class = "pagenum">244</span>
<a name = "page244" id = "page244"> </a>
<!--png 491-->
pieces of cloth, not, however, until a bit of pollen had been sprinkled
on the beads which lay on the cloth. The pollen end of the tube pointed
to the east. The four bunches of feathers were then laid on the tubes.
The song-priest rolled up each cloth and holding the four parcels with
both hands he placed them horizontally across the soles of the feet,
knees, palms, breast, back, shoulders, head, and across the mouth of the
invalid, and the invalid drew a breath as the parcel touched his lips.
He sat to the north of the rug facing east. The sick man then received
the parcels from the song-priest and held them so that the ends
projected from between the thumbs and forefingers, and repeated a prayer
after the theurgist, who sat facing the invalid. The prayer ran
thus:</p>

<blockquote>
People of the mountains and rocks, I&nbsp;hear you wish to be paid.
I&nbsp;give to you food of corn pollen and humming-bird feathers, and I
send to you precious stones and tobacco which you must smoke; it
has been lighted by the sun’s rays and for this I beg you to give
me a good dance; be with me. Earth, I&nbsp;beg you to give me a good
dance, and I offer to you food of humming-birds’ plumes and
precious stones, and tobacco to smoke lighted by the sun’s rays,
to pay for using you for the dance; make a good solid ground for
me, that the gods who come to see the dance may be pleased at the
ground their people dance upon; make my people healthy and strong
of mind and body.
</blockquote>

<p>The prayer being offered, the parcels were given by the theurgist to
an attendant, who deposited them in line three feet apart along the side
of the dancing ground in front of the lodge. Their proper place is
immediately on the ground that is to be danced upon, but to prevent them
from being trampled on they are laid to one side. The black tubes are
offerings to the gods and the blue to the goddesses of the mountains and
to the earth.</p>

FIRST CEREMONY.</a></h5>

<p>The construction of the second sweat house began at sunrise and was
completed at nine o’clock. Several large rocks were heated and placed in
the sweat house and as before white sage and <i>Bigelovia Douglasii</i>
were thrown in, the fumes of which were designed as medicine for the
sick man. After the invalid entered the sweat house, buckskin blankets,
etc., were drawn over the entrance. The song-priest, accompanied by two
attendants, sat a little to the south. He sprinkled meal around the west
base of the house and over the top from north to south and placed the
wands around its base in the manner heretofore described (the twelve
wands and medicine used were the special property of the theurgist). The
song-priest holding the rattle joined the choir in a chant. To his right
were two Navajo jugs filled with water and an Apache basket partly
filled with corn meal. A&nbsp;bunch of buckskin bags, one of the small
blue medicine tubes, a&nbsp;mountain sheep’s horn, and a piece of
undressed hide lay on the meal. Near by was a gourd half filled with
water in which meal was sprinkled; near this was a
<span class = "pagenum">245</span>
<a name = "page245" id = "page245"> </a>
<!--png 494-->
small earthenware vase containing water and finely chopped herbs. At the
conclusion of the chant the song-priest passed his rattle to one of the
choir and stirred the mixture in the bowl with his forefinger, and after
a few remarks to the invalid, who was still in the sweat house, he threw
some of the mixture in upon the hot rocks. This was repeated four times,
when the song-priest returned to his former position. The sweat-house
priest took from his shoulders a Navajo blanket and spread it near the
door a little to the right. A&nbsp;call from one of the attendants was a
signal for Hasjelti and Hostjoghon to appear. The two men personating
these gods were behind a tree south of the sweat house, their bodies,
arms, and legs painted white. Foxskins were attached pendent to the
backs of their girdles. As the gods approached the sweat house, the
patient came out and sat upon the blanket, and Hasjelti took a mountain
sheep’s horn, in the right hand and the piece of hide in the other and
rubbed the sick man, beginning with the limbs; as he rubbed down each
limb, he threw his arms toward the eastern sky and cried “yo-yo!” He
also rubbed the head and body, holding the hands on opposite sides of
the body. After this rubbing, the sick man drank from the bowl of
medicine-water, then arose and bathed himself with the same mixture, the
filled gourds being handed to him four times by Hasjelti, each time
accompanied with his peculiar hoot. Hostjoghon repeated the same
ceremony over the invalid. There was a constant din of rattle and
chanting, the gods disappeared, and immediately thereafter the theurgist
gathered the twelve wands from the base of the sweat house. He removed
the blue reed from the basket and laid it a little to the left of the
priest of the sweat house, who in turn handed it to an attendant to be
deposited with the wood of the sweat house in a neighboring tree. The
invalid proceeded to the medicine lodge followed by the song-priest
uttering a low chant. After entering the lodge the invalid took his seat
on the west side; the song-priest, still standing, took from a small
buckskin bag white powdered material which he rubbed on the soles of the
feet, palms, knees, breast, shoulders, and head of the invalid; then
taking a pinch of the same material he extended his hand first toward
the east and then toward the heavens and the earth. After these
attentions he took his accustomed seat in the lodge and joined in
conversation with his attendants.</p>

SECOND CEREMONY.</a></h5>

<p>Two sheepskins, a blanket, and cotton cloth were spread one upon the
other in front of the song-priest; and from the long reeds that had been
first rubbed with a polishing stone, then with tobacco, were cut ten
pieces an inch and a quarter long and two pieces 2 inches long. These
were colored black and blue, one long piece and five small ones being
black, the others blue. While these were being decorated the song-priest
and choir sang “My fathers, see, we are getting ready! We do our work
well, and you would better go into the house for we are to

<a name = "page246" id = "page246"> </a>
<!--png 495-->
have rain! Now, mothers, send down rain upon us!” This song was
constantly repeated.</p>

<p>The tubes when completed were laid in position to form a dual person.
The long black tube representing the body was first placed in position.
The long blue tube was then laid by its side and south of it. The pollen
end of the tubes pointed to the east. The right black leg was the next
placed in position, then the right blue leg, the left black leg and left
blue leg. The right black arm, then the right blue arm, the left black
arm and the left blue arm, then the black head and the blue head. (See
<a href = "#plateCXV">Pl. <span class =
"smallroman">CXV</span></a>.)</p>

<p>These tubes were filled with feathers, balls, and tobacco, and tipped
with the corn pollen and lighted with the crystal, the black tubes being
offerings to the gods, the blue to the goddesses. After they were
completed they were placed in position by a second attendant; and while
the tubes were being filled the song-priest and choir sang “See,
fathers! We fill these with tobacco; it is good; smoke it!” A message
was received from the fathers that they would smoke, and, puffing the
smoke from their mouths, they would invoke the watering of the earth.
They again sang “All you people who live in the rocks, all you who are
born among the clouds, we wish you to help us; we give you these
offerings that you may have food and a smoke! All women, you who live in
the rocks, you who are born among the fog, I&nbsp;pray you come and help
us; I&nbsp;want you to come and work over the sick; I&nbsp;offer to you
food of humming-birds’ plumes, and tobacco to smoke!” Two bunches of
feathers which had been placed to the east side of the rug pointing east
were deposited in two corn husks, each husk containing bits of
turquoise, black archaic beads, and abalone shell; corn pollen was
sprinkled on these. The song-priest then placed the dual body in the
husks thus: First, the black body was laid upon the husks to the north,
and upon this a pinch of pollen was sprinkled; the blue body was placed
in the other husks and pollen sprinkled upon it; then the two right legs
(black and blue) were put into the corn husks with the black body; the
two left legs were added to the same; the right and left arms and the
two heads were placed in the husk with the blue body and corn pollen
sprinkled upon them. The husks were closed and held by the song-priest
to the soles of the feet, palms, knees, breast, shoulders, back, and top
of head of the invalid, who repeated a long prayer after the theurgist,
and the parcels were given to an attendant, who carried them some
distance from the lodge to the north and placed them in a secluded shady
spot upon the ground. Two bits of tobacco were laid upon the ground and
upon these the body was placed, the figure in a recumbent position with
the arms over the head. The invalid for whom this ceremony was held
spared no expense in having the theurgist make the most elaborate
explanation to his near relatives of the secrets of the medicine
tubes.</p>

<p>The theurgist occupied his usual seat, surrounded by his corps of
attendants. The man personating Naiyenesgony had his body and limbs
painted black. The legs below the knee, the scapula, the breasts, and
the arm above the elbow were painted white. His loins were covered with
a fine red silk scarf, held by a silver belt; his blue knit stockings
were tied with red garters below each knee, and quantities of coral,
turquois, and white shell beads ornamented the neck. The man
representing Tobaidischinni had his body colored reddish brown, with
this figure (the scalp knot)

in white on the outside of each leg below the knee, on each arm below
the shoulder, each scapula, and on each breast. This design represents
the knot of hair cut from the heads of enemies, and the style is still
in use by the Navajo. The man wore a red woolen scarf around the loins,
caught on by a silver belt, and his neck was profusely ornamented with
coral, turquois, and white beads.<a class = "tag" name = "tag1" id =

<p>After the two men personating the gods left the lodge the invalid
entered and took his seat on the rug with his back to the theurgist. Two
attendants dressed him with the wreaths, beginning with the right ankle;
a&nbsp;piece was then tied around the calf, thigh, waist, around the
chest, right wrist, elbow, upper arm, throat, forehead, then around the
upper left arm, elbow, wrist, thigh, left knee, calf, and ankle. Thus
the man was literally obscured with a mass of pine. He sat in an upright
position with the legs extended and arms falling by his sides.
A&nbsp;chant was sung by the song priest, and in a few minutes
Naiyenesgony and Tobaidischinni appeared. Naiyenesgony drew his stone
knife in front of the invalid over the forehead to the feet, then down
the right side and down the back and down the left side. He then began
to remove the pine. As each wreath was taken off the clusters were
partly separated with the stone knife. Tobaidischinni assisted
Naiyenesgony by holding the wreaths while they were being cut.</p>

<p>When all the evergreen had been removed the personators of the gods
exclaimed, “Now, my people, we have killed all enemies!” and immediately
left the lodge. The song priest placed a small wreath of the pine on the
sick man’s head, and holding in his left hand a bunch of eagle plumes,
and in his right hand a rattle, he sang the ten songs and prayers,
assisted by the choir, that were given by Naiyenesgony and
Tobaidischinni to the Navajo to bring health and good fortune.

After the pine-bough wreaths had been separated the bits of
yucca-strings were picked up by the attendant and handed to
Naiyenesgony, who held them over the sick man’s head, after which the
bits were again divided with the knife. After the ten songs and prayers
had been chanted the invalid left the rug and sat a little to the
northeast, of it, with his knees drawn up. The song priest placed two
live coals in front of the invalid and sprinkled chopped herbs on the
coals, the fumes of which the invalid inhaled. The pines were carried
off and placed in the shade of a pine tree, that the disease might not
leave the pine and return to the invalid.<a class = "tag" name = "tag2"

FOURTH CEREMONY.</a></h5>

<p>The personators of Hasjelti and Hostjoghon adorned themselves for the
ceremony. Hasjelti wore ordinary clothing and a red scarf, with a silver
belt around the waist. Hostjoghon’s body was painted white, and he wore
a red woolen scarf around the loins, caught on with a silver belt.
A&nbsp;rug, composed of a blanket and a piece of white cotton, was
spread in front of the song priest, and the masks of Hasjelti and
Hostjoghon placed thereon. (See <a href = "#plateCXV">Pl. <span class =

<p>Upon the completion of the toilets of the personators of the gods
they hurried from the lodge, bearing their masks with them, when an
attendant made a cavity immediately in front of the rug 4 inches in
diameter, and the song priest sprinkled a circle of meal around the
cavity. The invalid entered the lodge and stood on the rug and removed
all of his clothing except the breech cloth. He then took his seat
facing east, with knees drawn up. A&nbsp;mask of the Hostjobokon, which
had been laid upon the rug, was drawn over the invalid’s head. Hasjelti
and Hostjoghon appeared at this juncture bearing a pine bough some 5
feet in height. An attendant made gestures over the sick man, holding in
his right hand a pinch of sacred meal, which was afterward placed in the
cavity. Hasjelti waved the pine bough five times around the invalid and
planted it in the cavity, where it was held in place by the gods. Then
bending its top, the attendant attached it to the mask over the
invalid’s head by a buckskin string which was fastened to the mask. The
song priest and choir all the while sang a weird chant. The gods raised
the bough, gave their peculiar hoots, and disappeared from the lodge,
carrying with them the pine bough with the mask attached to it. In a few
minutes they came back with the mask. After the chant the song-priest
placed meal on the soles of the invalid’s feet, knees, palms, breast,
back, shoulders, and head, and then put some in the cavity, after which
the cavity was filled with earth. Two coals were laid in front of the
invalid, and upon these the song priest placed finely broken herbs; an
attendant sprinkled water on the herbs, and the invalid inhaled the
fumes. The cotton cloth was

removed from the blanket rug, and the invalid stepped upon the rug and
put on his clothing. When the mask was removed from the invalid’s head
it drew all fever with&nbsp;it.</p>

FIRST CEREMONY.</a></h5>

<p>The theurgist carried a bowl of water and pine needles, and an
attendant bore a gourd of water, a&nbsp;small vase of powdered herbs,
and an Apache basket containing corn meal, buckskin bags, horn of the
mountain sheep and a piece of hide cut from between the eyes of the
animal. The theurgist and attendant took seats to the right of the
entrance of the sweat house west of the medicine lodge. This sweat house
was decorated with the rainbow. Over the entrance were, first, two
striped blankets, one upon the other, a&nbsp;buckskin, and a piece of
white cotton. Hot stones, etc., having been previously placed in the
sweat house, the sick man entered. The song-priest and four attendants
sang, accompanied by the rattle. At the conclusion of the chant Hasjelti
and Hostjoghon appeared as on the previous days. Hasjelti lifted the
coverings from the entrance and the invalid came out and sat upon a
blanket south of the entrance and bathed both his hands in the bowl
containing the pine needles and water; he then drank of it and bathed
his feet and legs to the thighs, his arms and shoulders, body and face
and head, and then emptied the remainder over his back. Hasjelti
manipulated the right leg with the sheep’s horn and hide, rubbing the
upper part of the leg with the right hand, then the under part with the
left; he then rubbed the sides of the leg in the same manner, each time
giving a hoot; the arms, chest, head, and face were similarly
manipulated. Hostjoghon repeated the hooting every time he changed the
position of the hands. Hasjelti, taking the gourd containing the water
and corn meal, gave four draughts of it to the invalid, hooting each
time the bowl was put to the lips; Hostjoghon did the same. The song and
rattle continued. Hasjelti, then put the powdered plants from the small
vase to the soles of the feet, knees, palms, breast, back, shoulders,
and top of the head of the invalid, hooting each time an application was
made; this was repeated by Hostjoghon. The invalid took a sip from the
bowl and rubbed the remainder over his body. The song-priest then
removed the wands from the base of the sweat house and the coverings
from the door; the pine boughs and hot stones were also removed and the
invalid preceded the song-priest to the medicine lodge. All the wood of
the sweat house was placed in a tree, excepting four small pieces, which
were deposited, together with the pine boughs from the interior of the
sweat house, in a semicircle formed by the rocks from the sweat house at
the base of a piñon tree. A&nbsp;line of meal 2 inches in length running
east and west was sprinkled on the apex of the semicircle, and upon this
line the black tube was laid. A&nbsp;bit of meal
<span class = "pagenum">250</span>
<a name = "page250" id = "page250"> </a>
<!--png 503-->
was sprinkled on the tube and a quantity over the pine boughs of this
small shrine. Before sprinkling the meal on the top of the medicine tube
the attendant waved his hand in a circle from left to right, calling
“hooshontko;” meaning: Widespread blessings that come not from spoken
words, but come to all, that people may have the blessings of corn
pollen, and that tongues may speak with the softness of corn pollen.</p>


<h5 class = "section"><a name = "day4_second" id = "day4_second">
SECOND CEREMONY.</a></h5>

<p>A rug was laid in front of the theurgist. Four medicine tubes were
placed on the rug, the one to the north end being white; the second one
black and red, a&nbsp;white line dividing the two colors; the third one,
blue; the fourth, black. The white tube was an offering to Hasjelti; the
red, to Zaadoltjaii; the blue, to Hostjoboard; the black, to Naaskiddi,
the hunchback. The tubes were filled as before described. These tubes
were begun and finished by the same person. (See <a href =
"#plateCXVI">Pl. <span class = "smallroman">CXVI</span></a>.) When the
tubes were finished they were put into corn husks and bits of cotton
cloth; tiny pieces of turquois, white shell, abalone, and archaic black
beads having first been placed on the husks and cloths. The four turkey
plumes with barred tips that lay upon the rug were subsequently placed
upon the tubes. These parcels were sprinkled by the song priest with
corn pollen, and after closing them he placed them in the hands of the
invalid, who sat at the northeast corner of the rug facing east. The
song-priest sat before him and said a long prayer, which the invalid
repeated. At the close of the prayer an aged attendant received the
parcels from the theurgist and placed them to the soles of the feet,
palms, etc., of the invalid. They were afterward placed to his mouth and
he drew from them a long breath. The old man carried the parcels south
over the brow of a hill and deposited them in secluded spots about 4
feet apart, repeating a brief prayer over each one; he then motioned
toward the east, south, west, and north, and returned to the lodge.
During his absence the choir sang; in the meantime the fire in the lodge
was reduced to embers.</p>


<h5 class = "section"><a name = "day4_third" id = "day4_third">
THIRD CEREMONY.</a></h5>

<p>About noon a circular bed of sand, some four inches in height and
four feet in diameter, was made. Five grains of corn and five pine
boughs were laid thereon; four of the grains of corn and four of the
boughs were placed to the cardinal points. The fifth and center branch
of pine covered most of the circle, its tips pointing to the east. The
fifth grain of corn was dropped in the center of the sand bed. (See <a
href = "#plateCXVII">Pl. <span class =
"smallroman">CXVII</span></a>,&nbsp;1). Four of these pine boughs were
cut from the east, south, north, and west sides of one tree. The fifth
bough may be taken from any part of the tree. Of the five grains of corn
one must be white, one yellow, and one blue, and the other two grains
may be of either of these three colors. On this particular occasion
there were
<span class = "pagenum">251</span>
<a name = "page251" id = "page251"> </a>
<!--png 506-->
two blue, two white, and one yellow. These grains were, after the
ceremony, dried and ground by the theurgist and placed among his
medicines. The boughs and sand absorbed the disease from the invalid,
and at the close of the ceremony they were carried to the north and
deposited in a shady spot that the sun might not touch and develop the
latent disease that had been absorbed by them. The boughs and sand were
never afterward to be touched. An Apache basket containing yucca root
and water was placed in front of the circle. (See <a href =
"#plateCXVII">Pl. <span class = "smallroman">CXVII</span></a>&nbsp;2.)
There was a second basket south of it which contained water and a
quantity of pine needles sufficiently thick to form a dry surface, and
on the top a number of valuable necklaces of coral, turquois, and
silver. A&nbsp;square was formed on the edge of the basket with four
turkey wands. (See <a href = "#plateCXVII">Pl. <span class =
"smallroman">CXVII</span></a>&nbsp;3.) The song-priest with rattle led
the choir. The invalid sat to the northeast of the circle;
a&nbsp;breechcloth was his only apparel. During the chanting an
attendant made suds from the yucca. The basket remained in position; the
man stooped over it facing north; his position allowed the sunbeams
which came through the fire opening to fall upon the suds. When the
basket was a mass of white froth the attendant washed the suds from his
hands by pouring a gourd of water over them, after which the song-priest
came forward and with corn pollen drew a cross over the suds, which
stood firm like the beaten whites of eggs, the arms of the cross
pointing to the cardinal points. A&nbsp;circle of the pollen was then
made around the edge of the suds. The attendant who prepared the suds
touched his right hand to the four points of the pollen lines and in the
center and placed it upon the head of the patient who first made a
circle embracing the sand and basket and then knelt upon the boughs in
the center of the sand.<a class = "tag" name = "tag3" id = "tag3" href =
"#note3">3</a> A handful of the suds was afterwards put upon his head.
The basket was placed near him and he bathed his head thoroughly; the
maker of the suds afterwards assisted him in bathing the entire body
with the suds, and pieces of yucca were rubbed upon the body. The chant
continued through the ceremony and closed just as the remainder of the
suds was emptied by the attendant over the invalid’s head. The song
priest collected the four wands from the second basket and an attendant
gathered the necklaces. A&nbsp;second attendant placed the basket before
the invalid who was now sitting in the center of the circle and the
first attendant assisted him in bathing the entire body with this
mixture; the body was quite covered with the pine needles which had
become very soft from soaking. The invalid then returned to his former
position at the left of the song priest, and the pine needles and yucca,
together with the sands, were carried out and deposited at the base of a
piñon tree. The body of the invalid was dried by rubbing with meal.</p>

FOURTH CEREMONY.</a></h5>

<p>This ceremony commenced almost immediately after the close of the one
preceding. The rug was spread over the ground in front of the song
priest; four bunches of small sticks were brought in and laid in piles
north, south, east, and west of the rug. Four attendants took seats,
each before a pile of the wood, and scraped off the bark of their
respective heaps; they then cut twelve pieces 2 inches in length, except
that cut by the attendant who sat at the north, who made his about 1¼
inches long. Being asked why he cut his shorter than the rest, he
replied, “All men are not the same size.” The sticks were sharpened at
one end and cut squarely off at the other. In order that all of the
sticks should be of the same length they were measured by placing the
three first fingers across the stick. The fifth man sat immediately to
the right of the song priest, who took a hollow reed from the large
medicine bag from which he cut four pieces, each piece the breadth of
his three fingers. The reed, which was cut with a stone knife, was
afterwards rubbed with native tobacco. Six sticks of each of the piles
had their square ends beveled; these represented females. The attendant
on the east side of the rug having completed his twelve sticks, painted
them white with kaolin finely ground and mixed with water. The flat ends
of the sticks were colored black; the beveled parts were painted blue;
around the lower end of the blue was a bit of yellow which represented
the jaw painted with corn pollen. Three black dots were painted upon the
blue for the eyes and mouth; the ground color was laid on with the
finger; the other decorations were made with yucca brushes. The man on
the south side colored his sticks blue. The tops of six sticks were
painted yellow, and six were black. The black ends were those having the
beveled spots. These spots were blue with a chin of yellow; they also
had the three black dots for eyes and mouth. The man to the west colored
his sticks yellow with the flat ends black; the beveled spots of six of
them were blue with a yellow chin and three black dots for eyes and
mouth. The sticks to the north were colored black; six of them had the
beveled parts colored blue with a yellow jaw, and three spots for eyes
and mouth; the six sticks that were not beveled had their flat tops
painted blue. All these sticks were laid on the rug with their flat ends
outward. The attendants who prepared the reeds, each reed being colored
for a cardinal point, filled them with balls of humming-bird feathers
and tobacco and lighted them with a crystal, when they were touched with
corn pollen. The reed for the east was white, the one for the south
blue, that for the west yellow, and that for the north black. Each reed
was placed at its appropriate point in line with the sticks. (See <a
href = "#plateCXVIII">Pl. <span class = "smallroman">CXVIII</span></a>.)
The theurgist then advanced, carrying a basket half filled with corn
meal. This he placed in the center of the rug; when kneeling on the edge
of the rug and beginning with the white sticks, he placed first the
white reed in the east side of the basket, and passing from this point
around to the right he placed the
<span class = "pagenum">253</span>

<!--png 510-->
six offerings to the gods, then the six to the goddesses. Next taking
the blue tube at the south end he placed it to the left of the white
line of sticks, leaving sufficient space for the sticks between it and
the white tube; all the blue ones were placed in position corresponding
to the white. The yellow followed next, and then the black. All were
placed with their flat ends or heads pointed to the rim of the basket.
The theurgist deposited the basket in the niche on a pile of turkey
feather wands, the wands resting upon a large medicine bag. The sticks
and scraps left after making the tubes were carried out and deposited
without ceremony.</p>

FIFTH CEREMONY.</a></h5>

<p>The rug which was spread in front of the song priest was composed of
two blankets whose edges met, and upon this rug there were two lines of
masks running north and south; the tops of the masks were to the east.
There were sixteen masks; those representing the gods cover the head,
and those representing goddesses cover the face only. They were
decorated with ribbons, plumes, etc. During the forenoon prayers were
said over them and meal sprinkled upon them.</p>


<h5 class = "section"><a name = "day4_sixth" id = "day4_sixth">
SIXTH CEREMONY.</a></h5>

<p>Just after dark those who were to take part in the ceremony prepared
to personate one of the Hostjobokon and two of the Hostjoboard
(goddesses)&mdash;Hostjoghon and Hasjelti. Hostjobokon’s body and limbs
were painted, and he wore a mountain lion’s skin doubled lengthwise and
fastened around the loins at the back, and a silver belt encircled his
waist. Hasjelti wore knee breeches and a shirt of black velvet,
ornamented with silver buttons. His face and hands were covered with
white kaolin. Hostjoghon’s body was painted white, and he wore a red
silk scarf around the loins, caught on with a silver belt. The two men
personating the goddesses had their limbs painted white; one wore a
black sash around his loins, held by a silver belt. The other had a red
woolen scarf and silver belt; gray foxskins hung from the back of the
belts. The masks were fastened to their heads before leaving the lodge
by means of a string and a lock of their hair, and they were then thrown
back from the head. After a little indulgence in their hoots they all
left the lodge. The invalid entered the lodge and, stepping upon a piece
of white cotton which had been laid diagonally across the rug to the
northeast and southwest, took off his clothing. The lodge had now become
very crowded. The fire, which had burned brightly during the day, was
mere coals. The attendant at the left of the song priest opened the
choir with the rattle. The invalid sat upon the cotton cloth. Hasjelti,
entering with his favorite hoot amidst rattle and song, placed the
square (representing the concentrated winds) four times over the head of
the invalid and ran out of the lodge. He entered again and received
<span class = "pagenum">254</span>
<a name = "page254" id = "page254"> </a>
<!--png 511-->
from the theurgist one of the twelve white sticks which during the
forenoon had been placed in the basket. The white stick farthest from
the white reed was handed him. This Hasjelti placed to the soles of the
feet, knees, palms, etc., of the invalid, amid hoots and antics, after
which he dashed out and hurled the stick to the east. One of the
Hostjoboard entered and received the next white stick, and after the
same ceremony ran out and cast it to the east. Hostjobokon returned and
the theurgist handed him the next white stick, when he repeated the
ceremony, hurried from the lodge, and threw the stick to the east.
Hostjoboard again entered, received a stick, repeated the ceremony, and
ran out and threw it to the east; and thus Hostjobokon and Hostjoboard
alternated until all the white sticks were disposed of, when Hasjelti
reappeared and received from the song priest the white reed (cigarette)
and carried it from the lodge. When he returned the theurgist handed him
one of the blue sticks, with which he repeated the ceremony and, leaving
the lodge, threw it to the south, when Hostjoghon and Hostjoboard
alternately disposed of the blue sticks in the same order in which the
white sticks had been distributed. The yellow and black sticks were
disposed of in a similar manner, Hasjelti officiating with the first
stick of each color and the reeds. The yellow sticks were thrown to the
west; the black to the north. This was all done amidst the wildest hoots
and song of the choir, accompanied by the rattle.</p>

<p>Hasjelti again appeared and placed the square four times over the
invalid’s head with wild hoots. The four cigarettes to be smoked by the
gods were afterwards taken by four of the personators of the gods and
deposited in a secluded spot under a tree and sprinkled with corn
pollen; after their return Hasjelti again placed the square over the
invalid’s head. The song priest placed two live coals in front of the
invalid, and upon the coals he put a pinch of tobacco, the smoke of
which the invalid inhaled. The attendant poured water over the coals,
when they were thrown out at the fire opening of the lodge. The
personators of the gods returned to the lodge bearing their masks in
their hands. The invalid put on his clothing and took his seat upon the
rug, but in a short time he returned to his former seat on the northwest
side of the lodge. The sweat-house priest appeared with a large buffalo
robe which he spread before the song priest, the head pointing north,
and upon this various kinds of calico were laid, carefully folded the
length of the robe. There were many yards of this. Upon the calico was
spread a fine large buckskin, and on this white muslin; these were all
gifts from the invalid to the song priest. The masks were then laid upon
the cotton (see <a href = "#plateCXV">Pl. <span class =
"smallroman">CXV</span></a>, 7,&nbsp;8); the mask of Hasjelti was on the
east side to the north end, that of Hostjoghon at the south end, and
between these the six masks of the Hostjobokon were placed. Immediately
under these were the six Hostjoboard, and beneath the latter were the
masks of Naiyenesgony and Tobaidischinni at the north end. Three other
masks of the Etsethle followed in line running south.
<span class = "pagenum">255</span>
<a name = "page255" id = "page255"> </a>
<!--png 512-->
After all the masks had been properly arranged the song priest sprinkled
them with pollen. Beginning with Hasjelti he sprinkled every mask of the
upper line thus: Over the top of the head down the center of the face,
then forming a kind of half-circle he passed over the right cheek, then
passing his hand backward to the left he sprinkled the same line up the
left cheek. The second and third rows had simply a line of the pollen
run across the masks, beginning at the north end. The theurgist repeated
a prayer during the sprinkling of the pollen, then handed the bag of
pollen to the priest of the sweat house, who repeated the sprinkling of
the masks, when everyone in the lodge, each having his individual bag of
pollen, hastened forward and sprinkled the masks, at the same time
offering prayers. The theurgist and priest of the sweat house again
sprinkled pollen on the masks as heretofore described.</p>

<p>Baskets and bowls in unlimited quantity, filled with food, were
placed in a circle around the fire which now burned brightly. The guests
formed into groups and drew the food toward them, but did not touch it
for a time. The invalid, song-priest, and his attendants, indulged in a
smoke which was social and not religious, the white man’s tobacco being
preferred on such occasions. A&nbsp;girl and a boy, about 12 years of
age, came into the lodge. The boy was the son of the invalid, the girl
his sister’s child. The boy knelt at the northeast end of the rug and
the girl at the southeast end. They were richly dressed in Navajo
blankets, coral necklaces, etc., and they remained perfectly quiet. The
theurgist and his attendants talked together in an undertone, and if the
inmates of the lodge spoke at all their voices were scarcely audible.
After a time the choir opened, led by the song-priest with his rattle.
During the singing the rattle was passed from one to the other. The
invalid did not join in the song. The choir continued an hour without
cessation, and then rested 2 minutes, and again began and continued for
another hour.<a class = "tag" name = "tag4" id = "tag4" href =
"#note4">4</a> At the conclusion of the singing the song-priest handed
to the girl a wand of turkey plumes taken from a basket of feathers
which had stood, since the placing of the masks, on the west side of
him. Another wand was passed to the boy; and the children received some
instructions from the song-priest, who spoke in an undertone, after
which, an attendant filled with water from a wicker water jug a basket
that had stood throughout the ceremony at the east of the rug.</p>

<p>The song was now resumed, and dipping the wand he held in the basket
of water the boy sprinkled the masks, beginning at the north end and
east row. The girl repeated the same. The east row of masks was
sprinkled twice. When the children sprinkled the middle and west rows,
the ceremony was always begun at the north end of each line of masks;
again dipping their wands in the water, the boy beginning at the north
side and the girl at the south, they sprinkled the inmates of
<span class = "pagenum">256</span>
<a name = "page256" id = "page256"> </a>
<!--png 513-->
the lodge. The children were very awkward, and were rendered more so by
the many scoldings given them for their mistakes. The sprinkling of the
people was continued until the water was exhausted. The lodge was also
sprinkled at the cardinal points. The song never ceased throughout this
ceremony. The girl and boy, taking the position first assigned them, an
attendant, with a reed filled with sacred tobacco, puffed the smoke over
the masks, smoking each mask separately on the east row; the middle and
west rows he hurriedly passed over. While this was being done an
attendant took a pinch from all the different foods and placed what he
gathered into a basket in the niche behind the song-priest.<a class =
"tag" name = "tag5" id = "tag5" href = "#note5">5</a> After the masks
had been smoked, the attendant puffed the smoke over all the people,
beginning on the north side of the lodge. During the smoking the song
ceased, but was resumed when the attendant took his seat. At the close
of the song sacred meal was mixed with water in a Zuñi pottery bowl.
This meal is made of green corn baked in the earth and then ground.
During the preparation of this medicine mixture the song-priest sang:
“This food is mixed for the people of the rocks! We feed you with this
food, O&nbsp;people of the rocks!” The theurgist then dipped his
forefinger into the mixture, and running his hand rapidly over the masks
from north to south, he touched each mouth; each line was passed over
four times. The invalid dipped his three first fingers into the basket,
and placing them in his mouth, sucked in his breath with a loud noise.
This was repeated four times by the invalid and then by each of the
attendants, when all the inmates of the lodge were expected to partake
of the mixture. This was done with a prayer for rain, good crops,
health, and riches. All hands now participated in the feast.</p>

<p>Little groups of threes and fives were formed over the floor of the
lodge; others less fortunate were closely packed together around the
outer edge of the lodge and could procure their food only through the
generosity of their neighbors. The girl and boy left the lodge after
having partaken of the sacred meal mixture. After refreshment the
song-priest lifted each mask with his left hand beginning with Hasjelti,
and first extending his right hand, which held a fine large crystal,
toward the heavens, he touched the under part of each mask with the
crystal; four times he passed over the masks. The choir sang but no
rattle was used. The crystal was afterward placed on the rug opposite
the basket of feathers. The food vessels were removed and the song
continued for a time when the song-priest repeated a long low prayer,
after which the song was resumed, and thus the night was consumed in
prayer and song over the masks.</p>

FIRST CEREMONY.</a></h5>

<p>A basket of yucca suds was prepared by an attendant, who cleansed his
hands of the suds by pouring a gourd of clear water over them; he then
put a handful of the suds upon the head of a man who stood before him,
nude with the exception of a breech cloth, after which the man washed
his head from a water jug which was held over the head of the
<span class = "pagenum">258</span>
<a name = "page258" id = "page258"> </a>
<!--png 515-->
bather by the attendant. The bather covered his body with the suds, and
the contents of the jug was emptied on the floor of the lodge by the
attendant. The man dressed himself in the ordinary cotton clothing with
rare beads around his neck, and a leather pouch held by a band of
mountain sheep skin over his shoulders; he knelt before a bowl of white
kaolin which he spread over his face; he then took his seat between two
attendants, the one to the right of him holding a pinch of native
tobacco and the one on the left holding corn meal in the palms of the
right hands.</p>

<p>At early dawn the buffalo robe at the entrance of the lodge was
slightly dropped from the doorway to admit the rays of approaching day.
The masks which had been sung and prayed over all night were laid away
in the niche behind the song-priest. The little girl who performed the
previous night returned to the lodge, but I could not see that she was
there for any purpose save to eat some of the remaining food, which had
been gathered into two large parcels and left by the old woman who
removed the vessels after the feast. A&nbsp;red blanket was laid and
upon it a piece of white cotton. A&nbsp;reed five inches in length and
twice the diameter of the others heretofore used was prepared. The reed
was colored black in the usual manner and filled with a feather ball and
tobacco. It was lighted with the crystal and touched with the pollen.
Upon the completion of the tube the invalid took his seat on the west
side of the rug, the attendant who prepared the tube sitting on the west
side; he took from one pouch four white shell beads and from another a
turquoise bead; he looped a cord of white cotton yarn some three feet
long around the pollen end of the tube and fastened to the loop two wing
feathers of the Arctic blue bird, one from the right wing and one from
the left, and a tail feather from the same bird and three feathers from
a bird of yellow plumage, the right and left wing and tail feather. The
five beads were strung on the string, the turquoise being the first put
on; these were slipped up the cord and two under tail-feathers and a
hair from the beard of the turkey were fastened to the end of the string
with a loop similar to that which attached it to the tube. (See <a href
= "#plateCXIX">Pl. <span class = "smallroman">CXIX</span></a>.) This was
the great (cigarette) offering to Hasjelti and must be placed in a
canyon near a spring, for all birds gather at the waters. This was
offered that the song-priest might have his prayers passed straight over
the line of song. This offering secures the presence of this most valued
god and so fills the mind of the song-priest with song and prayer that
it comes forth without hesitation and without thought, so that he may
never have to think for his words. A&nbsp;small quantity of each variety
of sand used in decorating was placed on a husk with a little tobacco,
and on these a pinch of corn pollen; the tube was then laid on the husk
and the string and feathers carefully placed. Two additional feathers,
the under tail of the eagle and turkey, were laid on the husk.
A&nbsp;blue feather was dipped in water, then in pollen, and rubbed
twice over these feathers; an attendant folded the parcel and
<span class = "pagenum">259</span>

<!--png 518-->
the song-priest received it and touched it to the soles of the feet,
knees, palms, breast, and back and mouth of the invalid; he then put a
pinch of the pollen into the invalid’s mouth, and a pinch on the top of
the head; he placed the folded husk in the invalid’s hand, and stood in
front of him and whispered a long prayer which the invalid repeated
after him. The manner of holding the husk has been previously described.
The man with painted face received the husk from the theurgist, who
returned to his seat and at once opened the chant with the rattle. At
the close of the chant the holder of the husk touched the soles of the
feet, palms, etc., of the invalid with it and left the lodge. This
precious parcel was taken three miles distant and deposited in a canyon
near a spring where there is a luxuriant growth of reeds. Prayers were
offered by the depositor for health, rain, food, and good fortune to
all. Only the theurgist and his attendants and a few of the near
relatives of the invalid were present at this ceremony.</p>

SECOND CEREMONY.</a></h5>

<p>The sweat-house priest preceded the invalid and song-priest, the
latter carrying his medicine basket, wands, etc. The hot stones and pine
boughs were put into the sweat house; meal was sprinkled around the west
base and the wands deposited, as before described, by the song-priest.
Three white and black striped blankets were placed over the entrance,
one upon the other, and upon these were a buckskin and several folds of
white muslin. An attendant brought a large medicine bowl half filled
with pine needles; water was poured upon these; a&nbsp;small earthen
bowl and a gourd containing water were placed before the song-priest,
who put into the bowl chopped sage, over which he sprinkled dried foods
reduced to powder; a&nbsp;small quantity of meal was also sprinkled into
the gourd and bowl. The song then began. A&nbsp;small pine bough was
laid to the right of the entrance of the sweat house. The opening of the
song was a call upon the gods to impart to the medicine power to
complete the cure of the invalid and to make all people well, and to
have a wet and good ground all over the earth. This song is specially
addressed to Toneennili, the water sprinkler.</p>

<p>Hasjelti and Hostjoghon arrived just as the sick man emerged from the
sweat house. The invalid bathed himself from the bowl of pine needles
and water. Taking the sheep’s horn in the left hand and a piece of hide
in the right, Hasjelti pressed the invalid’s body as before described.
The god was requested by the priest of the sweat house to pay special
attention to the rubbing of the head of the invalid. The small gourd was
handed to Hasjelti, who gave four drafts of its contents to the invalid.
Hasjelti touched the soles of the feet, palms, etc., of the invalid with
medicine water from the bowl. The gods then suddenly disappeared. On
this occasion Hostjoghon took no part in administering the medicine. The
invalid, after putting on his clothing, proceeded to the lodge, followed
by the song-priest. The sweat house
<span class = "pagenum">260</span>

was razed as usual, and the pine boughs and stones were placed to the
north of the house in a small piñon tree; the logs of the house were
deposited on the ground a few feet from the tree. A&nbsp;line of meal
the length of the medicine tube was sprinkled on the logs and the tube
laid thereon. Meal was sprinkled over the tube and logs.</p>

THIRD CEREMONY.</a></h5>

<p>The first sand painting occurred on October 16; it was begun in the
early forenoon and completed at sundown. Common yellowish sand was
brought in blankets. This formed the ground color for the painting. It
was laid to form a square 3 inches in depth and 4 feet in diameter. Upon
this three figures were painted after the manner described of the
painting of the rainbow over the sweat house. Nine turkey wands were
placed on the south, west, and north sides of the square, and a line of
meal with four foot-marks extended from near the entrance of the lodge
to the painting. (See <a href = "#plateCXX">Pl. <span class =
"smallroman">CXX</span></a>.)</p>

<p>Hasjelti stands to the north end in the illustration, holding the
emblem of the concentrated winds. The square is ornamented at the
corners with eagle plumes, tied on with cotton cord; an eagle plume is
attached to the head of Hasjelti with cotton cord. The upper horizontal
lines on the face denote clouds; the perpendicular lines denote rain;
the lower horizontal and perpendicular lines denote the first vegetation
used by man. Hasjelti’s chin is covered with corn pollen, the head is
surrounded with red sunlight, the red cross lines on the blue denote
larynx; he wears ear rings of turquoise, fringed leggings of white
buckskin, and beaded moccasins tied on with cotton cord. The figure to
the south end is Hostjoghon; he too has the eagle plume on the head,
which is encircled with red sunshine. His earrings are of turquoise; he
has fox-skin ribbons attached to the wrists; these are highly ornamented
at the loose ends with beaded pendants attached by cotton strings; he
carries wild turkey and eagle feather wands, brightened with red, blue,
and yellow sunbeams. The center figure is one of the Hostjobokon, and
upon this figure the invalid for whom the ceremonial is held sits. The
four footprints are made of meal. These the invalid steps upon as he
advances and takes his seat, with knees drawn up, upon the central
figure. After dark the invalid walked over the line of meal, being
careful to step upon the footprints in order that his mental and moral
qualities might be strengthened. The invalid removed his clothing
immediately after entering the lodge; he had downy breast feathers of
the eagle attached to the scalp lock with white cotton cord; he advanced
to the painting and took his seat upon the central figure. An attendant
followed him, and with his right hand swept the line of meal after the
invalid, removing all traces of it. The entrance of the invalid into the
lodge was a signal for the song-priest to open the chant with the
rattle. Hasjelti and Hostjoghon bounded into the lodge hooting wildly.
The former carried the square
<span class = "pagenum">261</span>
<a name = "page261" id = "page261"> </a>
<!--png 522-->
(the concentrated winds), which he placed over the sick man’s head.
Hostjoghon carried a turkey wand in each hand, and these he waved over
the invalid’s head and hooted; this was repeated four times, and each
time the gods ran out of the lodge. Hasjelti wore a velvet dress, but
Hostjoghon’s body was nude, painted white. This wild, weird ceremony
over, the sick man arose and the song-priest gathered the turkey wands
from around the painting, while an attendant erased it by rubbing his
hands over the sand to the center. The sands were gathered into a
blanket and carried out of the lodge and deposited some distance away
from the lodge, where the sun could not generate the germ of the
disease. The sand is never touched by any one when once carried out,
though before the paintings are erased the people clamor to touch them,
and then rub their hands over their own bodies that they may be cured of
any malady. The invalid, after putting on his clothes, returned to his
family lodge. A&nbsp;group then gathered around the spot where the
paintings had been and joined in a weird chant, which closed the fifth
day’s ceremony.</p>

SIXTH DAY.</a></h4>


<p>Preparations for a great sand painting began at daylight. Sand for
the ground work was carried in in blankets; the fire which had burned
through the previous ceremonies was first removed and all traces of it
covered with sand. As the artists were to begin the painting with the
center of the picture only a portion of the ground color was laid at
first, in order to enable them to work with greater facility. While the
ground color was being laid a man sat on one side of the lodge grinding
with a metate and mixing the colors. A&nbsp;quantity of coals were taken
from the exhausted fire from which to prepare black paint. A&nbsp;small
quantity of red sand was mixed with the charcoal to give it body or
weight. The colors used in this sand painting have all been referred to
in the description of the rainbow over the sweat house. After the
central portion of the ground work for the painting was smoothed off a
Jerusalem cross was drawn in black. The eye usually was the only guide
for drawing lines, though on two occasions a weaving stick was used. As
a rule four artists were employed, one beginning at each point of the
cross. Each arm of the cross was completed by the artist who began the
work. For illustration of painting see <a href = "#plateCXXI">Pl. <span
class = "smallroman">CXXI</span></a>.</p>

<p>The black cross-bars in the illustration denote pine logs; the white
lines the froth of the water; the yellow, vegetable debris gathered by
the logs; the blue and red lines, sunbeams. The blue spot in center of
cross denotes water. There are four Hostjobokon with their wives the
Hostjoboard; each couple sit upon one of the cross arms of the logs.
These gods carry in their right hands a rattle, and in their left sprigs
of piñon; the wives or goddesses carry piñon sprigs in both hands; the
rattle brings male rains, and the piñon, carried by the women, female
rains; these rains meet upon the earth, conceive and bring forth all
<span class = "pagenum">262</span>

<!--png 523-->
vegetation. Their heads are ornamented with eagle plumes tied on with
cotton cord. (Note: In all cases the round head denotes male and
octangular head female.) The gods have also a bunch of night-owl
feathers and eagle plumes on the left side of the head; both male and
female wear turquois earrings and necklaces of the same. The larynx is
represented by the parallel lines across the blue. A&nbsp;line of
sunlight encircles the head of both males and females. The white spots
on the side of the females’ heads represent the ears. The arms of the
goddesses are covered with corn pollen, and long ribbons of fox skins
are attached to the wrists, as shown on painting number one. All wear
beaded moccasins tied on with cotton cord. Their chins are covered with
corn pollen and red sunlight surrounds the body. The skirts only have an
additional line of blue sunlight. Hasjelti is to the east of the
painting. He carries a squirrel skin filled with tobacco. His shirt is
white cotton and very elastic. The leggings are of white deer skin
fringed, and the moccasins are similar to the others. His head is
ornamented with an eagle’s tail, and to the tip of each plume there is a
fluffy feather from the breast of the eagle. A&nbsp;bunch of night-owl
feathers is on either side of the eagle tail where it is attached to the
head. The horizontal and perpendicular lines on the face were referred
to in the description of the first sand painting. The projection on the
right of the throat is a fox skin. Hostjoghon’s headdress is similar to
that of Hasjelti’s. Two strips of beaver skin tipped with six quills of
the porcupine are attached to the right of the throat. The four colored
stars on the body are ornaments of beads. The shirt of this god is
invisible; the dark is the dark of the body. Hostjoghon carries a staff
colored black from a charred plant. The Navajo paint their bodies with
the same plant. The top of the staff is ornamented with a turkey’s tail
tied to the staff with white cotton cord; eagle and turkey plumes are
alternately attached to the staff with a cord.</p>

<p>The Naaskiddi are to the north and south of the painting; they carry
staffs of lightning ornamented with eagle plumes and sunbeams. Their
bodies are nude except the loin skirt; their leggings and moccasins are
the same as the others. The hunch upon the back is a black cloud, and
the three groups of white lines denote corn and other seeds of
vegetation. Five eagle plumes are attached to the cloud backs (eagles
live with the clouds); the body is surrounded with sunlight; the lines
of red and blue which border the bunch upon the back denote sunbeams
penetrating storm clouds. The black circle zigzagged with white around
the head is a cloud basket filled with corn and seeds of grass. On
either side of the head are five feathers of the red shafted flicker
(<i>Colaptes cafer</i>); a&nbsp;fox skin is attached to the right side
of the throat; the mountain sheep horns are tipped with the under tail
feathers of the eagle, tied on with cotton cord. The horns are filled
with clouds. The rainbow goddess, upon which these gods often travel,
completes the picture.</p>

Upon completion of the painting the song-priest, who stood to the east
of it holding in his hand a bag of sacred meal, stepped carefully
between the figures, sprinkling pollen upon the feet and heart of each.
He then sprinkled a thread of pollen up each cheek and down the middle
of the face of the figures, afterwards extending his right hand toward
the east. The face of the encircling rainbow goddess was also sprinkled.
The song-priest placed the sacred wands around the rainbow, commencing
on the west side of the painting, and repeated a prayer, pointing his
finger to the head of each figure. He also placed a small gourd of
medicine water in the hands of the rainbow goddess and laid a small
cedar twig on the gourd. The invalid upon entering the lodge was handed
an Apache basket containing sacred meal, which he sprinkled over the
painting and placed the basket near the feet of the rainbow goddesses;
the song-priest and choir sang to the accompaniment of the rattle.
A&nbsp;short time after the entrance of the invalid Hasjelti appeared,
and taking the evergreen from the gourd dipped it into the medicine
water and sprinkled the feet, heart, and heads of the sand figures,
after which the invalid sat in the center of the cross. Hasjelti gave
him a sip of the sacred water from the gourd and returned the gourd to
its place; then he touched the feet, heart, and head of each figure
successively with his right hand, each time touching the corresponding
parts of the body of the invalid. Every time Hasjelti touched the
invalid he gave a weird hoot. After he had been touched with sands from
all the paintings the theurgist, selecting a few live coals from a small
fire which had been kept burning near the door, threw them in front of
the invalid, who still retained his seat in the center of the painting.
The theurgist placed herbs, which he took from a buckskin bag, on the
coals from which a very pleasant aroma arose. An attendant sprinkled
water on the coals and a moment after threw them out of the fire
opening. The song-priest gathered the wands from around the edge of the
painting and four attendants began to erase it by scraping the sands
from the cardinal points to the center. Again the people hurried to take
sand from the hearts, heads, and limbs of the figures to rub upon
themselves. The sands were gathered into a blanket and deposited at the
base of a piñon tree about one hundred yards north of the lodge.
A&nbsp;chant closed the ceremony.</p>

SEVENTH DAY.</a></h4>


<p>The first business of the day was the preparation of an elaborate
sand picture, and though the artists worked industriously from dawn, it
was not completed until after 3 o’clock. The paint grinder was kept busy
to supply the artists. It was observed that in drawing some of the lines
the artists used a string of stretched yarn instead of the weaving
stick. When five of the figures had been completed, six young men came
into the lodge, removed their clothes, and whitened their bodies and
limbs with kaolin; they then left the lodge to solicit food from the
people, who
<span class = "pagenum">264</span>
<a name = "page264" id = "page264"> </a>
<!--png 526-->
were now quite thickly gathered over the mesa to witness the closing
ceremonies. The mesa top for a mile around was crowded with Indians,
horses, sheep, and hogans (lodges); groups of 3 to 20 Indians could be
seen here and there gambling, while foot and horse racing were features
of special interest. Indeed, the people generally were enjoying
themselves at the expense of the invalid. The rainbow goddess,
Nattsilit, surrounding the painting, was about 25 feet in length. Upon
the completion of the painting the song-priest sprinkled the figures
with pollen as before described and planted the feather wands around the
pictures.</p>

<p>In the illustration of this painting, <a href = "#plateCXXIII">Pl.
<span class = "smallroman">CXXIII</span></a>, Hasjelti will be
recognized as the leader. He carries a fawn skin filled with sacred
meal; the spots on the skin are seven and in the form of a great bear.
The fawn skin indicates him as the chief of all game. It was Hasjelti
who created game. The first six figures following Hasjelti are the
Ethsethle. The next six figures are their wives. Toneennili, the water
sprinkler (<i>to</i>, water, and <i>yonily</i>, to sprinkle), follows
carrying a water jug, from which he sprinkles the earth. The Ethsethle
wear leggings of corn pollen and the forearms of the gods are covered
with pollen. Their wives have their arms and bodies covered with the
same. The skirts of the Ethsethle are elaborately ornamented and their
pouches at their sides are decorated with many beads, feathers, and
fringes. The gods are walking upon black clouds and mist (the yellow
denoting mist), the women upon blue clouds and mist.</p>

<p>During the ceremony an Apache basket containing meal was brought in
and placed at the feet of the rainbow goddess. The invalid entered the
lodge, which had become quite filled with privileged spectators, and
receiving the basket of meal, sprinkled the figures from left to right;
he then removed all his clothing except his breech cloth and stood east
of the painting. Hostjoghon stepped to the head of the rainbow goddess
and taking the small gourd of medicine water dipped the cedar twig into
the water and sprinkled the figures, then touched the twig to the feet,
heart, and head of each figure, commencing at the male figure to the
north and passing south, then beginning with the female figures to the
north and passing south. The invalid took his seat in the center of the
painting with his knees drawn to his chin. Hostjoghon held the medicine
gourd over each figure and passed it to the invalid, who took four sips,
Hostjoghon hooting each time he passed the gourd to the invalid. After
returning the gourd and twig to their former position he placed the
palms of his hands to the feet and head of each figure and then placed
his palms on the corresponding parts of the invalid’s body, and pressed
his head several times between his hands. After touching any part of the
invalid, Hostjoghon threw his hands upward and gave one of his
characteristic hoots. The song-priest placed coals in front of the
invalid and herbs upon them, as he had done the day before, and then
retired. The coals were afterwards thrown out of the fire opening and
the crowd rushed to the painting to rub their bodies with the sand.

EIGHTH DAY.</a></h4>


<p>The grinding of the paint began at daylight, and just at sunrise the
artists commenced their work. When any mistake occurred, which was very
seldom, it was obliterated by sifting the ground color over it. Each
artist endeavored to finish his special design first, and there was
considerable betting as to who would succeed. The rapidity with which
these paints are handled is quite remarkable, particularly as most of
the lines are drawn entirely by the eye. After the completion of the
painting, each figure being three and a half feet long, corn pollen was
sprinkled over the whole by the song priest. (See illustration, <a href
= "#plateCXXIII">Pl. <span class = "smallroman">CXXIII</span></a>.)</p>

<p>The corn stalk in the picture signifies the main subsistence of life;
the square base and triangle are clouds, and the three white lines at
the base of the corn stalk denote the roots of the corn. The figures of
this picture are each 3½ feet in length. These are the Zenichi (people
of the white rock with a red streak through&nbsp;it) and their wives.
Their homes are high in the canyon wall. The black parallelogram to the
west of the painting designates a red streak in the rock in which are
their homes. The delicate white lines indicate their houses, which are
in the interior or depths of the rock, and can not be seen from the
surface. This canyon wall is located north of the Ute Mountain. These
people of the rocks move in the air like birds. The red portion of the
bodies of the Zenichi denote red corn; the black portion black clouds.
The red half of the face represents also the red corn; the blue of the
bodies of the others denote vegetation in general, and the yellow,
pollen of all vegetation. The zigzag lines of the bodies is lightning;
the black lines around the head, zigzagged with white, are cloud baskets
that hold red corn, which is stacked in pyramidal form and capped with
three eagle plumes. There are five feathers of the red and black shafted
flicker (<i>Colapteo cafer</i>) on either side of the head.
A&nbsp;lightning bow is held in the left hand, the right holds a rattle
ornamented with feathers. The females carry in their hands decorated
baskets and sprigs of piñon, and they wear white leggings and beaded
moccasins. The Zenichi never dance. These gods are also called
Zaadoljaii, meaning rough mouth, or anything that protrudes roughly from
the mouth. (The mouth and eyes of these gods protrude.) The rainbow
goddess is represented at the north and south end of the painting. The
corn stalk has two ears of corn, while the original stalk had 12 ears.
Two of these ears the gods gave to the younger brother of the Tolchini
when they commanded him to return to the Navajo and instruct them how to
represent the gods in sand painting and in masks. The four corner
figures will be recognized as the Naashiddi (hunchback, or mountain
sheep).</p>

During the ceremony Hasjelti, dressed in black velvet ornamented with
silver, and Hostjoboard, with her nude body painted white and with silk
scarf around the loins caught on with silver belt, left the lodge to
gather the children upon the mesa for the purpose of initiating them;
but the children had already been summoned by men who rode over the mesa
on horseback, visiting every hogan to see that all the children were
brought for initiation. A&nbsp;buffalo robe was spread at the end of the
avenue which extended from the medicine lodge some three hundred yards.
The head of the robe was to the east; at the end of the robe blankets
were spread in a kind of semicircle. Most of the children were
accompanied by their mothers. The boys were stripped of their clothing
and sat upon the buffalo robe. The head of the line being to the north,
they all faced east with their feet stretched out. Their arms hung by
their sides and their heads were bent forward. The girls sat in line
upon the blanket in company with their mothers and the mothers of the
boys. It is entirely a matter of choice whether or not a mother
accompanies her child or takes any part in the ceremony. The girls also
sat like the boys, their heads bent forward. Their heads were bent down
that they might not look upon the gods until they had been initiated. Up
to this time they were supposed never to have had a close view of the
masks or to have inspected anything pertaining to their religious
ceremonies. The children ranged from five to ten years of age. At this
particular ceremony nine boys and six girls were initiated. When the
children were all in position, Hasjelti, carrying a fawn skin containing
sacred meal, and Hostjoboard, carrying two needles of the Spanish
bayonet, stood in front of the children. The boy at the head of the line
was led out and stood facing the east. Hasjelti, with the sacred meal,
formed a cross on his breast, at the same time giving his peculiar hoot.
Hostjoboard struck him upon the breast, first with the needles held in
her right hand and then with those held in the left. Hasjelti then
turned the boy toward the right until he faced west and made a cross
with meal upon his back, when Hostjoboard struck him twice on the back
with the needles. He was again turned to face the east, when both arms
were extended and brought together. Hasjelti made a cross over the arms
and then over the knees. Each time the boy was crossed with the meal
Hostjoboard struck the spot first with the needles in the right hand and
then with those in the left, after which the boy returned to his seat.
The cross denotes the scalp knot. Most of the boys advanced quite
bravely to receive the chastisement. I&nbsp;noticed but one who seemed
very nervous, and with great difficulty he kept back the tears. The
boys’ ceremony over, the gods approached the girls, beginning at the end
of the line next to the boys. Hasjelti marked a line of meal on each
side of the foot of the girl, when Hostjoboard, now holding two ears of
yellow corn wrapped with piñon twigs, placed them to the soles of the
girl’s feet and Hasjelti drew a line of meal on each hand; after which
Hostjoboard placed the
<span class = "pagenum">267</span>
<a name = "page267" id = "page267"> </a>
<!--png 531-->
ears of corn to the palms of the hands, she holding the corn in her
palms and pressing it to the palms of the girl’s hands. Hasjelti formed
a cross on the breast with the meal and Hostjoboard pressed the two ears
of corn to the breast; a&nbsp;cross was made on the back and the two
ears of corn pressed to the back. Hasjelti, with his right hand, then
drew a line on the girl’s left shoulder, and with his left hand a line
on the girl’s right shoulder, the corn being pressed to the shoulders in
the manner described. Two lines of meal were run over the forehead back
to the top of the head, and the two ears of corn pressed to the top of
head. The boys were nude but the girls were gayly dressed in blankets,
jewelry, etc. At the close of this ceremony the representatives of the
gods removed their masks and called upon the children to raise their
heads. The amazement depicted upon the faces of the children when they
discovered their own people and not gods afforded much amusement to the
spectators. The masks were laid upon a blanket and the girls and boys
were commanded to look upon them. Hostjoboard placed her mask upon the
face of each boy and girl and woman in the line, beginning at the north
end of the line, giving a hoot each time the mask was placed upon
anyone. Great care was taken that the mask should be so arranged upon
the face that the eyes might look directly through the eyeholes, for
should any blunder occur the sight of at least one eye would be lost. It
is scarcely on before it is removed. After the masks had been placed on
all the faces it was laid beside Hasjelti’s. The man personating
Hasjelti sprinkled his mask and then Hostjoboard’s with pollen, and the
man personating Hostjoboard sprinkled Hasjelti’s mask and then his own
with pollen. The boy to the north end of the line was called out and
from the pollen bag took a pinch of pollen and sprinkled first the mask
of Hasjelti and then Hostioboard’s. This was repeated by each boy, girl,
and woman in the line. In approaching the masks they always pass back of
the line around to the north side and then step in front of the masks.
The mask is sprinkled in this wise: A&nbsp;line of pollen is run from
the top of the head down to the mouth; passing around to the right the
line is drawn upward over the left cheek; the hand continues to move
outside of the mask to a point below the right cheek, then up the right
cheek. The younger children’s hands were guided by the representatives
of the gods. It would be a great fatality to sprinkle a drop of meal
over the eye holes; the individual committing such an error would become
blind at least in one eye. Great care is also taken that the line is run
up the cheek, for if it was run down not only would vegetation be
stunted, but the lives of the people would become so, as all people and
things should aim upward not downward. The line running down through the
center of the face calls upon the gods above to send down rain upon the
earth and health to all people. Two or three children started through
ignorance to run the meal down one of the cheeks; they were instantly
stopped by Hasjelti, but not until the people looking on had expressed
<span class = "pagenum">268</span>
<a name = "page268" id = "page268"> </a>
<!--png 532-->
great horror. All in the line having gone through this ceremony the
crowd of spectators sprinkled the masks in the same manner. I&nbsp;was
requested to sprinkle them, and at the same time was specially
instructed to run the lines up the cheeks. This closed the ceremony of
initiation. The boys were then permitted to go around at will and look
at the masks and enter the lodge and view the sand painting. Hasjelti
and Hostjoboard returned to the lodge, carrying their masks in their
hands.</p>

<p>About an hour after the ceremony of the initiation of the children a
large buffalo robe was spread on the avenue with his head to the east,
around which a circle of some hundred feet in diameter was formed by
horsemen and pedestrians who gathered, eager to witness the outdoot
ceremony. The theurgist and invalid were seated outside of the lodge,
south of the entrance. The dieties personated in this occasion were the
gods Hasjelti and Taadotjaii, and the goddess Tebahdi. Haskjelti wore
black velvet and silver ornaments, with red silk scarf around the waist.
Taadotjaii was nude, his body being painted a reddish color. The limbs
and body were zigzagged with white, representing lightning and downy
breast feathers of the eagle, and in his right hand a gourd rattle
devoid of ornamentation. Yebahdi wore the ordinary squaw’s dress and
moccasins, with many silver ornaments, and a large blanket around her
shoulders touching the ground. Hasjelti approached dancing, and
sprinkled meal over the buffalo robe, and the invalid stood upon the
robe. Hasjelti, followed by Zaadoltjaii, again entered the circle and
sprinkled meal upon the robe. The goddess Yebahdi following, stood
within the circle some 20 feet from the robe on the east side and facing
west. Hasjelti, amidst hoots and anties, sprinkled meal upon the
invalid, throwing both his hands upward. Immediately Zaadoltjaii, with
arrow in the left hand and rattle int he right, threw both hands up over
the invalid amidst hoots and antics. They then passed to Yebahdi, who
holds with both hands a basket containing the two yellow ears of corn
wrapped with pine twigs that were used in the children’s ceremony, and
indulged in similar antics over the goddess. As each representative of
the gods threw up his hands she raised her basket high above and in
front of her head. Hasjelti, together with Zaadoltjaii and Yebahdi, then
passed around within the circle to the other three points of the
compass. At each point Yebahdi took her position about 20 feet from the
buffalo robe, when Hasjelti and Zaadoltjhaii repeated their performance
over the invalid and then over Yebahdi each time she elevated the
basket. The invalid then entered the lodge, followed by the
representatives of the gods, who were careful to remove their masks
before going in. The invalid sat on the cornstalk in the center of the
sand painting, facing east. Zaadoltjaii stepped upon the painting, and
taking the little medicine gourd from the hands of the rainbow goddess,
dipped the cedar twig into the
<span class = "pagenum">269</span>
<a name = "page269" id = "page269"> </a>
<!--png 533-->
medicine water and sprinkled the painting, beginning at the south side.
Zaadoltjaii gave the invalid a draft from the gourd, and waving the
gourd from left to right formed a circle, amidst the wildest cries. He
gave three more drafts to the invalid, each time waving the gourd around
the invalid with a wave toward the east. He then placed the palm of his
hand over the feet of all the figures, beginning with the figure at the
south end, west side; running up that line he began with the figure on
the north end east side, running down that line; he then placed his
hands to the soles of the feet of the invalid, hooting twice; then the
heart of the invalid was touched in the same manner with the palm of the
right hand, the left hand being placed to his back. The body was pressed
in this way four times amid loud cries. This was repeated upon the
invalid. After touching each figure of the painting, the right hand was
placed to the forehead of the invalid and the left hand to the back of
the head, and the head pressed in this way on all sides. The song-priest
put live coals before the invalid and upon them sprinkled tobacco and
water, the fumes of which the invalid inhaled. An attendant then threw
the coals out of the fire opening, and the song-priest gathered the
twelve turkey wands from around the painting while the inmates of the
lodge hastened forward to press their hands upon what remained of the
figures, then drawing a breath from their hands, they pressed them upon
their bodies that they might be cured of any infirmities, moral or
physical, after which four men gathered at the points of the compass and
swept the sand to the center of the painting, and placing it in a
blanket deposited it a short distance from the lodge.</p>

FIRST CEREMONY.</a></h5>

<p>The final decoration of masks with ribbons, plumes, etc., began at
sunrise and consumed most of the morning. About noon two sticks 1 inch
in diameter and 6 inches long were colored; one, of piñon, was painted
black, the other, of cedar, was colored red. Three medicine tubes were
made, one black, one red, and one blue. These were placed in a basket
half filled with meal; the basket stood in the niche behind the
song-priest. Two men personated Naiyenesgony and Tobaidischinni.
Naiyenesgony’s body was painted black (from the embers of a burnt weed
of which specimens were procured) and on the outside of his legs below
the knee, on the upper arms, breast and scapula were bows in white but
without arrows. Tobaidischinni had his body painted with the scalp knot
in white in relative positions to the bows on Naiyenesgony. A&nbsp;third
man, personating the turquois hermaphrodite Ahsonnutli, wore the usual
squaw’s dress with a blanket fastened over the shoulders reaching to the
ground. Her mask was blue. The three left the lodge carrying their masks
in their hands. Passing some distance down the avenue to the east they
put on their masks and returned to the lodge.
<span class = "pagenum">270</span>
<a name = "page270" id = "page270"> </a>
<!--png 534-->
A&nbsp;buffalo robe had been spread in front of the lodge. Just as the
maskers returned, the invalid, wrapped in a fine red Navajo blanket and
bearing a basket of sacred meal, stepped upon the robe; he had before
stood in front of the lodge by the side of the song-priest. The many
spectators on foot and horseback clad in their rich blankets formed a
brilliant surrounding for this ceremony, which took place just at the
setting of the son. Naiyenesgony carried in his right hand a large lava
celt which was painted white. Tobaidischinni followed next carrying in
his right hand the black wood stick which had been prepared in the
morning, and in his left hand the red stick. Ahsonnutli followed with
bow and arrow in the left hand and an arrow in the right with a quiver
thrown over the shoulder.</p>

<p>Naiyenesgony drew so close to the invalid that their faces almost
touched and pointed his celt toward the invalid. Tobaidischinni then
approached and in the same manner pointed the sticks toward him, after
which he was approached by Ahsonnutli with her bow and arrows. This was
repeated on the south, west, and north sides of the invalid; each time
the invalid partially turned his arm, shoulder, and back to sprinkle
meal upon the gods. The gods then rushed to the entrance of the medicine
lodge repeating the ceremony there, when they hurried to the south side
of the lodge (the invalid having returned to the lodge; the buffalo robe
was carried in by an attendant). The gods went from the south side of
the lodge to the west and then to the north performing the same
ceremony. As the invalid had spent many days in the lodge and the
disease at each day’s ceremony exuded from his body, it was deemed
necessary that these gods should go to the four points of the compass
and draw the disease from the lodge. When they entered the lodge the
buffalo robe had been spread in front of the song-priest with its head
north. Upon this robe each god knelt on his left knee, Naiyenesgony on
the north end of the robe, Ahsonnutli on the south end, and
Tobaidischinni between them, all facing east. The song-priest, followed
by the invalid, advanced to the front of the line carrying the basket
containing the medicine tubes. He sprinkled Naiyenesgony with corn
pollen, passing it up the right arm over the head and down the left arm
to the hand. He placed the black tube in the palm, of the left hand of
the god, the priest chanting all the while a prayer. The red tube was
given with the same ceremony to Tobaidischinni, and the blue tube with
the same ceremony to Ahsonnutli. The quiver was removed from Ahsonnutli
before she knelt. The song-priest, kneeling in front of Naiyenesgony,
repeated a long litany with responses by the invalid, when the gods left
the lodge led by Naiyenesgony who deposited his tube and stick in a
piñon tree, Tobaidischinni depositing his in a cedar tree, and
Ahsonnutli hers in the heart of a shrub.</p>

SECOND CEREMONY.</a></h5>

<p>The scene was a brilliant one. Long before the time for the dance a
line of four immense fires burned on each side of the avenue where the
<span class = "pagenum">271</span>
<a name = "page271" id = "page271"> </a>
<!--png 535-->
dance was to take place, and Navajo men and women clad in their bright
colored blankets and all their rare beads and silver encircled each
fire. Logs were piled 5 or 6 feet high. In addition to these eight fires
there were many others near and far, around which groups of gamblers
gathered, all gay and happy. Until this night no women but those who
carried food to the lodge had been present at any of the ceremonies
except at the initiation of the children. To say that there were 1,200
Navajo would be a moderate calculation. This indeed was a picture never
to be forgotten. Many had been the objections to our sketching and
writing, but throughout the nine days the song-priest stood steadfastly
by us. One chief in particular denounced the theurgist for allowing the
medicine to be put on paper and carried to Washington. But his words
availed nothing. We were treated with every consideration. We were
allowed to handle the masks and examine them closely, and at times the
artists working at the sand painting really inconvenienced themselves
and allowed us to crowd them that we might observe closely the many
minute details which otherwise could not have been perceived, as many of
their color lines in the skirt and sash decorations were like threads.
The accompanying sketches show every detail.</p>

<p>The green or dressing room was a circular inclosure of pine boughs at
the end of the avenue. It was about 10 feet high by 20 feet in diameter
made of piñon branches with their butts planted in the ground, their
tops forming a brush or hedge. Within this inclosure the masks were
arranged in a row on the west side. A&nbsp;large fire burned in the
center affording both heat and light. The different sets, when a change
of dress from one set of men to another was to be made, repaired to this
green room for that purpose. This inclosure was also the resort during
the night for many Indians who assisted the dancers in their
toilets.</p>

<p>At 10 o’clock the ceremonies opened by the entrance upon the avenue
of the song-priest who came from the green room. He wore a rich red
blanket and over this a mountain lion skin; immediately after him
followed Hasjelti, leading the four Etsethle (the first ones). These
represented first, natan (corn); second, natin (rain); third, nanase
(vegetation); fourth, jadetin (corn pollen). Their masks were blue
ornamented with feathers and were similar to the masks worn by the
dancers; their bodies were painted white with many rare beads around
their necks, and they wore loin skirts with silver belts; a&nbsp;gray
fox skin was attached pendant to the back of the belt, and blue
stockings, tied with red garters, and moccasins completed their dress.
They carried in their right hands gourd rattles painted white. The
handles of these may be of any kind of wood, but it must be selected
from some tree near which lightning has struck, but not of the wood of
the tree struck by lightning. Corn pollen was in the palms of their left
hands and in the same hand they carried also a piñon bough. Hasjelti
wore a suit of velvet ornamented with silver buttons; he never speaks
except by signs. They
<span class = "pagenum">272</span>
<a name = "page272" id = "page272"> </a>
<!--png 536-->
advanced single file with a slow regular step and when within 20 feet of
the lodge the priest turned and faced Hasjelti and repeated a short
prayer, when the Etsethle sang.</p>


<h6><a name = "#day9_second_song" id = "day9_second_song">
SONG OF THE ETSETHLE.</a></h6>

<div class = "poem">

</div>

<p>These lines are repeated four times. The first line indicates that
corn is the chief subsistence; the second, that it is necessary to pray
to Hasjelti that the earth may be watered; the third, that the earth
must be embraced by the sun in order to have vegetation; the fourth,
that pollen is essential in all religious ceremonies. The Etsethle
signify doubling the essential things by which names they are known,
corn, grain, etc., they are the mystic people who dwell in canyon sides
unseen. After the song the invalid with meal basket in hand passed
hurriedly down the line of gods and sprinkled each one with meal,
passing it from the right hand up to the right arm, to the head then
down the left arm to the hand, placing a pinch in the palm of the left
hand. The invalid then returned and stood to the north side of Hasjelti
who was to the left of the song-priest. The theurgist stood facing natan
(corn) and offered a prayer which was repeated by the invalid.
Continency must be observed by the invalid during the nine days
ceremonial and for four days thereafter.</p>

PRAYER TO THE ETSETHLE.</a></h6>

<p>“People, you come to see us; you have a house in the heart of the
rocks; you are the chief of them; you are beautiful. Come inside of our
houses. Your feet are white; come into our house! Your legs are white;
come into our house! Your bodies are white; come into our house! Your
face is white; come into our house! Old man, this world is beautiful;
the people look upon you and they are happy. This day let all things be
beautiful.”</p>

<p>This prayer is repeated many times, merely substituting for old man
old woman, then youth, young girl, boy, then all children. The old man
and woman spoken of are not the first old man and woman in the myth of
the old man and woman of the first world. After the prayer the
song-priest and invalid took seats by the entrance of the lodge.
Hasjelti took his position to the west end and to the north of the line
of the Etsethle. He remained standing while the four slowly raised

<a name = "page273" id = "page273"> </a>
<!--png 537-->
the right foot squarely from the ground, then on the toe of the left
foot, which motion shook the rattle. In a short time Hasjelti passed
down the line hooting. He passed around the east end, then returned up
the north side to his former position, and again hooting, resumed the
leadership of the Etsethle, who gave a long shake of the rattle as soon
as Hasjelti stood in front of them. They then followed their leader to
the dressing room.</p>


<h5 class = "section"><a name = "day9_concl" id = "day9_concl">
CONCLUSION&mdash;THE DANCE.</a></h5>

<p>The song-priest having returned to the green room, emerged therefrom,
followed by Hasjelti, who carried a fawn skin partially filled with
meal, and by twelve dancers and Hostjoghon, holding in each hand a
feather wand. The twelve dancers represented the old man and woman six
times duplicated. Hasjelti led the dancers and Hostjoghon followed in
the rear. When they came near the lodge the song-priest turned and faced
the dancers, and being joined by the invalid, he led him down the line
of dancers on the north side, the invalid carrying a sacred meal basket,
and sprinkled the right side of each dancer. The song-priest and invalid
then returned to their seats in front of the lodge. Hasjelti passed down
the line on the north side and joined Hostjoghon at the east end of the
line, both then passing to the west end, where each one endeavored to be
the first to stamp twice upon the ground immediately in front of the
leading dancer. This double stamp is given with hoots, and they then
returned down the line to the center, when Hasjelti dashes back to the
west end, clasping the throat of the fawn skin with his right hand and
holding the legs with his left, with both his arms extended to the
front. Hostjoghon extending his hands with the feather wands in them,
they point the head of the skin and tops of the wands directly in front
of them as they stand facing each other, hooting at the same time.
Reversing sides by dashing past each other, Hasjelti points his fawn
skin to the east while Hostjoghon points his wands to the west. They
then return to their respective positions as leader and follower.</p>

<p>After the dance begins Hasjelti passes down the north side and joins
Hostjoghon at the east end of the dancers, Hasjelti keeping to the north
side of Hostjoghon. Three of the men, representing women, were dressed
in Navajo squaw dresses and three of them in Tusayan squaw dresses; they
held their arms horizontally to the elbow and the lower arm vertically,
and, keeping their feet close together, raised themselves simultaneously
on their toes. The dance was begun in single file, the men raising only
their right feet to any height and balancing on the left. After a minute
or two the line broke, the women passing over to the north side and the
men to the south side; almost instantaneously, however, they grouped
into a promiscuous crowd, women carrying a pine twig in each hand and
the men a gourd rattle in the right hand and a pine twig in the left.
The men’s bodies were
<span class = "pagenum">274</span>
<a name = "page274" id = "page274"> </a>
<!--png 538-->
painted white and were nude, excepting the silk scarfs and mountain lion
and other skins worn around the loins. Just before the stamping of the
feet in the beginning of the dance, a&nbsp;rattle was shaken by all the
male dancers, which was the signal for a peculiar back motion of the
right arm and body and one which preceded the actual dancing. The six
males lean their bodies to the right side extending the right hand
backward, and then bringing it forward in a circular under sweep around
to the mouth with a hoot. They then turn and face the east, and bending
their bodies toward the south perform the same motion as before, when
they turn to the west and repeat it in that direction. At the same time
the leader and follower repeat their peculiar performance with the fawn
skin and wands to the east and west. Dancing promiscuously for a few
moments to song and rattle, the men representing women singing in
feminine tones, they form again in two lines, the women as before on the
north side. The man at the west end of the male line and the woman at
the same end of the female line, meeting each other midway between the
lines she passes her right arm through the arm of her partner, his arm
being bent to receive it; they pass between the line and are met a short
distance from the other end of the line by Hasjelti and Hostjoghon, who
dance up to meet them, the movement resembling closely the old-fashioned
Virginia reel. The couple then dance backward between the lines to their
starting point, then down again, when they separate, the man taking his
place in the rear of the male line and the woman hers in the rear of the
female line. This couple starting down the second time, the man and
woman immediately next in line lock arms and pass down in the same
manner, Hasjelti and Hostjoghon scarcely waiting for the first couple to
separate before dancing up to meet the second couple; the remaining
couples following in like order until the first couple find themselves
in their former position at the head of the line. Now a group dance is
indulged in for a minute or two when lines are again formed, and a
second figure exactly like the first is danced. This figure was again
repeated without variation, after which the men and women fell into
single file, and, led by Hasjelti and followed by Hostjoghon, left the
dancing ground. They did not go to the green, however, but moved off a
short distance to rest for a moment and returned. Upon each return the
invalid passed down the line on the north side sprinkling each dancer
with meal, Hasjelti and Hostjoghon performing with the fawn skin and
wands. This dance of four figures was repeated twelve times, each time
the dancers resting but a moment. After the twelve dances the dancers
passed to the green room, where they were relieved by a second set of
men. The second series of dances were exactly like the first. There were
twenty-one dances, four figures in each dance, and each time the dancers
appeared they were sprinkled with meal by the invalid, while Hasjelti
and Hostjoghon performed their antics with fawn skin and wands. The
third series embraced all the dances
<span class = "pagenum">275</span>

<!--png 539-->
exactly like the above. The fourth series embraced nineteen dances. The
only variation in this was that the leaders were often more clownish in
their performances, and upon several occasions only four men
representing women appeared. In this case two men danced together. Some
of the dancers dropped out from weariness, which caused diminution in
some of the sets. The last dance closed at the first light of day. The
song-priest had preceded the last dancers to the green room and awaited
their arrival to obtain the masks, which were his special property.</p>

MYTHS OF THE NAVAJO.</a></h4>


<h5 class = "section"><a name = "myths_creation" id = "myths_creation">
CREATION OF THE SUN.</a></h5>

<p>The first three worlds were neither good nor healthful. They moved
all the time and made the people dizzy. Upon ascending into this world
the Navajo found only darkness and they said “We must have light.”</p>

<p>In the Ute Mountain lived two women, Ahsonnutli, the turquoise
hermaphrodite, and Yolaikaiason, the white-shell woman. These two women
were sent for by the Navajo, who told them they wished light. The Navajo
had already partially separated light into its several colors. Next to
the floor was white indicating dawn, upon the white blue was spread for
morning, and on the blue yellow for sunset, and next was black
representing night. They had prayed long and continuously over these,
but their prayers had availed nothing. The two women on arriving told
the people to have patience and their prayers would eventually be
answered.</p>

<p>Night had a familiar, who was always at his ear. This person said,
“Send for the youth at the great falls.” Night sent as his messenger a
shooting star. The youth soon appeared and said, “Ahsonnutli, the
ahstjeohltoi (hermaphrodite), has white beads in her right breast and
turquoise in her left. We will tell her to lay them on darkness and see
what she can do with her prayers.” This she did.<a class = "tag" name =
"tag6" id = "tag6" href = "#note6">6</a> The youth from the great falls
said to Ahsonnutli, “You have carried the white-shell beads and
turquoise a long time; you should know what to say.” Then with a crystal
dipped in pollen she marked eyes and mouth on the turquoise and on the
white-shell beads, and forming a circle around these with the crystal
she produced a slight light from the white-shell bead and a greater
light from the turquoise, but the light was insufficient.</p>

<p>Twelve men lived at each of the cardinal points. The forty-eight men
were sent for. After their arrival Ahsonnutli sang a song, the men
sitting opposite to her; yet even with their presence the song failed to
secure the needed light. Two eagle plumes were placed upon each cheek of
the turquoise and two on the cheeks of the white-shell beads
<span class = "pagenum">276</span>
<a name = "page276" id = "page276"> </a>
<!--png 540-->
and one at each of the cardinal points. The twelve men of the east
placed twelve turquoises at the east of the faces. The twelve men of the
south placed twelve white-shell beads at the south. The twelve men of
the west placed twelve turquoises at the west. Those of the north placed
twelve white-shell beads at that point. Then with the crystal dipped in
corn pollen they made a circle embracing the whole. The wish still
remained unrealized. Then Ahsonnutli held the crystal over the turquoise
face, whereupon it lighted into a blaze. The people retreated far back
on account of the great heat, which continued increasing. The men from
the four points found the heat so intense that they arose, but they
could hardly stand, as the heavens were so close to them. They looked up
and saw two rainbows, one across the other from east to west, and from
north to south. The heads and feet of the rainbows almost touched the
men’s heads. The men tried to raise the great light, but each time they
failed. Finally a man and woman appeared, whence they knew not. The
man’s name was Atseatsine and the woman’s name was Atseatsan. They were
asked “How can this sun be got up.” They replied, “We know; we heard the
people down here trying to raise it, and this is why we came.”
“Chanteen” (sun’s rays), exclaimed the man, “I&nbsp;have the chanteen;
I&nbsp;have a crystal from which I can light the chanteen, and I have
the rainbow; with these three I can raise the sun.” The people said, “Go
ahead and raise it.” When he had elevated the sun a short distance it
tipped a little and burned vegetation and scorched the people, for it
was still too near. Then the people said to Atseatsine and Atseatsan,
“Raise the sun higher,” and they continued to elevate it, and yet it
continued to burn everything. They were then called upon to “lift it
higher still, as high as possible,” but after at certain height was
reached their power failed; it would go no farther.</p>

<p>The couple then made four poles, two of turquoise and two of
white-shell beads, and each was put under the sun, and with these poles
the twelve men at each of the cardinal points raised it. They could not
get it high enough to prevent the people and grass from burning. The
people then said, “Let us stretch the world;” so the twelve men at each
point expanded the world. The sun continued to rise as the world
expanded, and began to shine with less heat, but when it reached the
meridian the heat became great and the people suffered much. They
crawled everywhere to find shade. Then the voice of Darkness went four
times around the world telling the men at the cardinal points to go on
expanding the world. “I&nbsp;want all this trouble stopped,” said
Darkness; “the people are suffering and all is burning; you must
continue stretching.” And the men blew and stretched, and after a time
they saw the sun rise beautifully, and when the sun again reached the
meridian it was only tropical. It was then just right, and as far as the
eye could reach the earth was encircled first with the white dawn of
day, then with the blue of early morning, and all things were perfect.

And Ahsonnutli commanded the twelve men to go to the east, south, west,
and north, to hold up the heavens (Yiyanitsinni, the holders up of the
heavens), which office they are supposed to perform to this day.</p>


<h5 class = "section"><a name = "myths_hasj" id = "myths_hasj">
HASJELTI AND HOSTJOGHON.</a></h5>

<p>Hasjelti and Hostjoghon were the children of Ahsonnutli, the
turquoise, and Yolaikaiason (white-shell woman, wife of the sun).
Ahsonnutli placed an ear of white corn and Yolaikaiason an ear of yellow
corn on the mountain where the fogs meet. The corn conceived, the white
corn giving birth to Hasjelti and the yellow corn to Hostjoghon. These
two became the great song-makers of the world. They gave to the mountain
of their nativity (Henry Mountain in Utah) two songs and two prayers;
they then went to Sierra Blanca (Colorado) and made two songs and
prayers and dressed the mountain in clothing of white shell with two
eagle plumes placed upright upon the head. From here they visited San
Mateo Mountain (New Mexico) and gave to it two songs and prayers, and
dressed it in turquoise, even to the leggings and moccasins, and placed
two eagle plumes on the head. Hence they went to San Francisco Mountain
(Arizona) and made two songs and prayers and dressed that mountain in
abalone shells with two eagle plumes upon the head. They then visited
Ute Mountain and gave to it two songs and prayers and dressed it in
black beads. This mountain also had two eagle plumes on its head. They
then returned to the mountain of their nativity to meditate, “We two
have made all these songs.”</p>

<p>Upon inquiring of their mothers how they came into existence, and
being informed, they said, “Well, let our number be increased; we can
not get along with only two of us.” The woman placed more yellow and
white corn on the mountain and children were conceived as before.
A&nbsp;sufficient number were born so that two brothers were placed on
each of the four mountains, and to these genii of the mountains the
clouds come first. All the brothers consulted together as to what they
should live upon and they concluded to make game, and so all game was
created.</p>

<p>Navajo prayers for rain and snow are addressed to Hasjelti and
Hostjoghon. These gods stand upon the mountain tops and call the clouds
to gather around them. Hasjelti is the mediator between the Navajo and
the sun. He prays to the sun, “Father, give me the light of your mind,
that my mind may be strong; give me some of your strength, that my arm
may be strong, and give me your rays that corn and other vegetation may
grow.” It is to this deity that the most important prayers of the Navajo
are addressed. The lesser deities have shorter prayers and less valuable
offerings made to them. Hasjelti communicates with the Navajo through
the feathered kingdom, and for this reason the choicest feathers and
plumes are placed in the cigarettes and attached to the prayer sticks
offered to him.</p>

THE FLOATING LOGS.</a></h5>

<p>A man sat thinking, “Let me see; my songs are too short; I&nbsp;want
more songs; where shall I go to find them?” Hasjelti appeared and,
perceiving his thoughts, said, “I&nbsp;know where you can go to get more
songs.” “Well, I&nbsp;much want to get more, and I will follow you.”
When they reached a certain point in a box canyon in the Big Colorado
River they found four gods (the Hostjobokon) at work hewing logs of
cottonwood. Hasjelti said, “This will not do; cottonwood becomes
water-soaked; you must use pine instead of cottonwood.” The Hostjobokon
then began boring the pine with flint, when Hasjelti said, “That is slow
work,” and he commanded the whirlwind to hollow the log.
A&nbsp;Jerusalem cross was formed with one solid log and a hollow one.
The song-hunter entered the hollow log and Hasjelti closed the end with
a cloud, that the water of the river might not enter when the logs were
launched upon the great waters. The Hostjobokon, accompanied by their
wives, rode upon the logs, a&nbsp;couple sitting on the end of each
cross arm. These were accompanied by Hasjelti, Hostjoghon, and two
Naaskiddi, who walked on the banks to ward the logs off from the shore.
Hasjelti carried a squirrel skin filled with tobacco from which to
supply the gods on their journey. Hostjoghon carried a staff ornamented
with eagle and turkey plumes and a gaming ring with two humming birds
tied to it with white cotton cord. The two Naaskiddi carried staffs of
lightning.<a class = "tag" name = "tag7" id = "tag7" href =
"#note7">7</a> After floating a long distance down the river they came
to waters that had a shore on one side only, and they landed. Here they
found people like themselves. These people, on learning of the
song-hunter’s wish, gave to him many songs and they painted pictures on
a cotton blanket and said, “These pictures must go with the songs. If we
give this blanket to you you will lose it. We will give you white earth
and black coals which you will grind together to make black paint, and
we will give you white sand, yellow sand, and red sand, and for the blue
paint you will take white sand and black coals with a very little red
and yellow sand. These together will give you blue.<a class = "tag" name

<p>The song-hunter remained with these people until the corn was ripe.
There he learned to eat corn and he carried some back with him to the
Navajo, who had not seen corn before, and he taught them how to raise it
and how to eat&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>As the logs would not float upstream the song-hunter was conveyed by
four sunbeams, one attached to each end of the cross-logs, to the box
canyon whence he emerged. Upon his return he separated the logs, placing
an end of the solid log into the hollow end of the other and planted
this great pole in the river, whereto this day it is to be seen by those
so venturesome as to visit this point.</p>

NAIYENESGONY AND TOBAIDISCHINNI.</a></h5>

<p>This world was destroyed five times. The first time by a whirlwind;
the second, by immense hail stones; the third, by smallpox, when each
pustule covered a whole cheek; the fourth, all was destroyed by
coughing; the fifth time Naiyenesgony and Tobaidischinni went over the
earth slaying all enemies.</p>

<p>These two boys were born at Tohatkle (where the waters are mated),
near Ute Mountain, in Utah; they were the children of Ahsonnutli.
Ahsonnutli and Yolaikaiason (the white-shell woman) were the creators of
shells. Ahsonnutli had a beard under her right arm and Yolaikaiason had
a small ball of flesh under her left arm from which they made all
shells. The eyes of Naiyenesgony and Tobaidischinni were shells placed
on their faces by Ahsonnutli; the shells immediately becoming brilliant
the boys could look upon all things and see any distance without their
eyes becoming weary. A&nbsp;stick colored black was placed to the
forehead of Naiyenesgony and one colored blue to that of Tobaidischinni.
When Naiyenesgony shook his head the stick remained firm on the
forehead, but he felt something in the palm of his hand, which proved to
be three kinds of seeds, and he said, “We must go by this.” When
Tobaidischinni shook his head the stick dropped off the forehead and
they thought a long time and said, “We must go by this.” This is why the
deer sheds his horns. In ceremonials the breath is drawn from sticks
which are made to represent the originals; the sticks are also held to
wounds as a curative.</p>

<p>These two boys grew from infancy to manhood in four days and on the
fourth day they made bows and arrows; on the fifth day they began using
them. Although they were the children of Ahsonnutli they did not know
her as their mother, but supposed her to be their aunt. Frequently they
inquired of her where they could find their father. She always told them
to stop their inquiries, for they had no father. Finally they said to
her, “We know we have a father and we intend to go and look for him.”
She again denied that they had a father, but they were determined and
they journeyed far to the east and came to the house of the sun. The
house was of white shell, and the wife of the sun (Yolaikaiason) was
also of white shell. The wife inquired of the youths where they were
from, and, said she, “What do you want here?” They replied, “We came to
hunt our father.” When the sun returned to his home in the evening he
discovered the youths as soon as he entered his house and he asked,
“Where are those two boys from?” The wife replied, “You say you never do
anything wrong when you travel; these two boys call you father and I
know they are your children.” The wife
<span class = "pagenum">280</span>
<a name = "page280" id = "page280"> </a>
<!--png 544-->
was very angry. The sun sent the boys off a distance and threw a great
roll of black clouds at them intending to kill them, but they were not
injured, and they returned to the house. He then pushed them against a
sharp stone knife, but they slipped by uninjured. Four times they were
thrust against the knife, but without injury. The sun finding his
attempts unsuccessful said, “It is so, you are my sons.” The sun then
ordered Hasjelti and Toneennili (these two were special attendants upon
the sun) to build a sweat house and put the boys in, that they might die
from the heat. Toneennili made an excavation inside of the sweat house,
put the boys into the hole, and placed a rock over the hole and built a
fire over the rock. When the rock became very hot the sun ordered
Toneennili to sprinkle it four times with water, being careful to keep
the entrance to the sweat house closely covered. After a time he
uncovered the entrance and removing the rock the sun commanded the boys
to come out. He did not expect to be obeyed, as he thought and hoped the
boys were dead, but they came out unharmed. The sun then said, “You are
indeed my own children; I&nbsp;have tried in vain to destroy you.” The
boys wished to return to the woman whom they supposed to be their aunt.
Before departing the sun asked them what they wished; they said, “We
want bows and arrows, knives, and good leggings. There are people around
the world eating our people (the Navajo). Some of these people are great
giants and some are as small as flies; we wish to kill them with
lightning.” The sun gave the youths clothing that was invulnerable, and
he gave them lightning with which to destroy all enemies, and a great
stone knife. They then went over the world. Naiyenesgony killed with the
lightning arrows and Tobaidischinni scalped with his knife. After all
enemies had been destroyed Naiyenesgony and Tobaidischinni said to the
Navajo, “Now we will leave you and return to our home in the Ute
Mountains, where the waters are mated, but before leaving you we will
give to you the ten songs and prayers that will bring health and good
fortune to your people. Tobaidischinni is the parent of all waters.”</p>

THE BROTHERS.</a></h5>

<p>The Tolchini (a Navajo clan) lived at Wind Mountain. One of the
brothers became crazy and he went off a long way, and on his return
brought with him a pine bough; a&nbsp;second time he returned with corn,
and from each trip he brought something new and had a story to tell
about it. His brothers would not believe him, and said, “He is crazy; he
does not know what he is talking about.” The brothers, however, became
very jealous of him, and constantly taunted him with being a crazy liar.
The Tolchini left the Wind Mountain and went to a rocky foothill east of
San Mateo Mountain. They had nothing to eat but a kind of seed grass.
The eldest brother said, “Let us go hunt,” and told the crazy brother
not to leave the camp. But after five days and nights and no word coming
from the brothers he determined to follow
<span class = "pagenum">281</span>

<!--png 581-->
them and help them, bring home the game; he thought they had killed more
deer than they could carry. After a day’s travel he camped near a
canyon, selecting a cavelike place in which to sleep, for he was tired
and thirsty. There was much snow, but no water, so he made a fire and
heated a rock and made a hole in the ground, and placing the rock in the
cavity put in some snow, which melted and furnished him a draft to
quench his thirst. Just then he heard a tumult over his head like people
passing and he went out to see who made the noise, and he discovered
many crows crossing back and forth over the canyon. This was the home of
the crow. There were other feathered people also (the chaparral cock was
among them). He saw also many fires which had been made by the crows on
either side of the canyon. Two other crows arrived and stood near him
and he listened hard to hear all that was being said. These two crows
cried out, “Somebody says, somebody says.” The youth did not know what
to make of this. Then, a&nbsp;crow from the opposite side of the canyon
called, “What is the matter; tell us, tell us; what is wrong?” The two
first criers then said, “Two of us got killed; we met two men who told
us. They said the two men, who were all the time traveling around
(referring to the two brothers of the crazy youth), killed twelve deer
and a party of our people went to the deer after they were killed. Two
of us who went after the blood of the deer were shot.” The crows on the
other side of the canyon, called, “Which men got killed?” The first
crier replied, “The chaparral cock, who sat on the horn of the deer, and
the crow, who sat on its backbone.” The other called out, “We are not
surprised that they were killed; that is what we tell you all the time.
If you will go after the dead deer you must expect to be killed.” “We
will not think of them longer; they are dead and gone. We are talking of
things of long ago.” The younger brother sat quietly below and listened
to everything that was being said.</p>

<p>After a time the crows on the other side of the canyon made a great
noise and began to dance. They had many songs at that time. The youth
could not see what they were doing, but he listened all the time. After
the dance began a great fire was made, and then he could see black
objects moving, but he could not distinguish any people. He recognized
the voice of Hasjelti. Though the youth was crazy, he remembered
everything in his heart. He even remembered the words of the songs that
continued all the night; he remembered every word of every song. He said
to himself, “I&nbsp;will listen until daylight.” These people did not
remain on one side of the canyon where the first fires were built, but
they crossed and recrossed in their dance and had fires on both sides of
the canyon. They danced back and forth until daylight (on&nbsp;the ninth
night of the Hasjelti Dailjis was a repetition of this dance), when all
the crows and the other birds flew away to the west. All that he saw
after they left was the fires and smoke. The crazy youth then started
off in a run to his brothers’ camp to tell what he had seen and heard.
His

brothers were up early and saw the boy approaching. They said,
“I&nbsp;bet he will have lots of stories to tell. He will say he saw
something no one ever saw, or somebody jumped on him.” And the
brother-in-law who was with them said, “Let him alone; when he comes
into camp he will tell us all, and I believe these things do happen, for
he could not make up these things all the time.”</p>

<p>The camp was surrounded by piñon brush and a large fire burned in the
center of the inclosure; there was much meat roasting over the fire. As
soon as the youth reached the camp he raked over the coals and said,
“I&nbsp;feel cold.” The brother-in-law replied, “It is cold. When people
camp together they tell stories to one another in the mornings; we have
told ours and we must now hear yours.” The youth related his experiences
of the past night. He said, “Where I stopped last night was the worst
camp I ever had.” The brothers kept their backs to the youth and
pretended not to pay any attention, but the brother-in-law listened and
questioned him. He continued, “I&nbsp;never heard such a noise.” The
brothers then remarked, “I&nbsp;thought he would say something like
that” (they were jealous of this crazy brother, he saw so much they
could not see). The brother-in-law was inclined to believe the youth’s
story and asked what kind of people made the noise. “I&nbsp;do not know.
They were strange people to me, but I do know they danced all night back
and forth across the canyon, and I know my brothers killed twelve deer,
and afterwards killed two of their people who went for the blood of the
deer. I&nbsp;heard them say, ’That is what must be expected if you will
go to such places you must expect to be killed.’” The elder brother
began thinking and without turning toward the youth asked, “How many
deer did you say were killed?” and he answered “twelve.” Then the older
brother said, “Well, sir, you have told me many stories and I never
believed you, but this story I do believe. What is the matter with you
that you know all these things? How do you know these things and find
out these things?” The youth replied, “I&nbsp;do not know how, but all
these things come to my mind and my eyes.” The elder brother said,
“I&nbsp;will now give more thought to you and study how you find out all
about these things. We have a lot of meat and we did not know how to get
it home; now that you have come let us return; you shall carry the
meat.” When halfway home they were about to descend a mesa, and when on
the edge they sat down to rest; then they saw far down the mesa four
mountain sheep, and the brothers commanded the youth to kill one for
them. They said, “Our meat is dry; your legs are fresh, so you will kill
the sheep.” The youth succeeded in heading off the sheep by hiding in a
bush (<i>Bigelovia Douglasii</i><a class = "tag" name = "tag9" id =
"tag9" href = "#note9">9</a>) sometimes called sage brush but it is not
the true sage brush. The sheep came directly toward him; he aimed his
arrow at them, but before he could pull the bow his arm stiffened and
became dead and the sheep passed by. All the sheep

passed him, but he again headed them off by hiding in the stalks of a
large yucca.<a class = "tag" name = "tag10" id = "tag10" href =
"#note10">10</a> The sheep passed within five steps of him, and again
when the time to pull the bow came his arm stiffened. The crow people
were watching him all the time. He again followed the sheep and got
ahead of them and hid behind a birch tree in bloom; he had his bow
ready, but as the sheep approached him they became gods. The first one
was Hasjelti, the second was Hostjoghon, the third was Naaskiddi, the
fourth one was Hadatchishi. At this strange metamorphosis the youth was
greatly alarmed, he dropped his bow and fell to the ground senseless.
Hasjelti stood at the east side of the youth, Hostjoghon to the south,
Naaskiddi to the west, and Hadatchishi to the north of him. Each had a
rattle, which was used to accompany the songs for the recovery of the
youth. They also traced with their rattle in the sand this emblem,

meaning a figure of a man, and drew parallel lines at the head and feet
with the rattle. When this was done the youth recovered and the gods had
again assumed the form of sheep. They asked the youth why he had tried
to shoot them. “You see you are one of us,” they said. The youth had
become transformed into a sheep. “There is to be a dance far off to the
north beyond Ute Mountain; we want you to go with us to the dance. We
will dress you like ourselves and teach you to dance; we will then go
over the world.” The brothers who watched from the mesa top wondered
what the trouble could be. They could not see the gods. They saw the
youth lying on the ground and said, “We must go and see what is the
matter.” On reaching the place they found that their young brother had
gone. They saw where he had lain and where the people had worked over
him. They began crying and said, “For a long time we would not believe
him, and now he has gone off with the sheep.” They made many efforts to
head off the sheep, but without success, and they cried all the more,
saying, as they returned to the mesa, “Our brother told us the truth and
we would not believe him; had we believed him he would not have gone off
with the sheep; perhaps some day we will see him.”</p>

<p>At the dance the sheep found seven others like themselves. This made
their number twelve. The seven joined the others in their journey around
the world. All people let them see their dances and learn their songs.
Then all the number excepting the youth talked together and they said,
“There is no use keeping him with us longer (referring to the youth); he
has learned everything; he may as well go now and tell his people and
have them do as we do.” The youth was instructed to have twelve in the
dance, six gods and six goddesses, with Hasjelti to lead them. He was
told to have his people make masks to represent them. It would not do to
have twelve Naaskiddi

represented among the Navajo, for they would not believe it and there
would be trouble. They could not learn all of their songs. The youth
returned to his brothers, carrying with him all songs, all medicine, and
clothing.</p>

THE OLD MAN AND WOMAN OF THE FIRST WORLD.</a></h5>

<p>In the lower world four gods were created by Etseastin and Etseasun.
These gods were so annoyed by ants that they said, “Let us go to the
four points of the world.” A spring was found at each of the cardinal
points, and each god took possession of a spring, which he jealously
guarded.</p>

<p>Etseastin and Etseasun were jealous because they had no water and
they needed some to produce nourishment. The old man finally obtained a
little water from each of the gods and planted it, and from it he raised
a spring such as the gods had. From this spring came corn and other
vegetation. Etseastin and Etseasun sat on opposite sides of the spring
facing each other, and sang and prayed and talked to somebody about
themselves, and thus they originated worship. One day the old man saw
some kind of fruit in the middle of the spring. He tried to reach it but
he could not, and asked the spider woman (a&nbsp;member of his family)
to get it for him. She spun a web across the water and by its use
procured the fruit, which proved to be a large white shell, quite as
large as a Tusayan basket. The following day Etseastin discovered
another kind of fruit in the spring which the spider woman also brought
him; this fruit was the turquoise. The third day still another kind of
fruit was discovered by him and obtained by the spider woman; this was
the abalone shell. The fourth day produced the black stone bead, which
was also procured.</p>

<p>After ascending into the upper world Etseastin visited the four
corners to see what he could find. (They had brought a bit of everything
from the lower world with them). From the east he brought eagle
feathers; from the south feathers from the bluejay; in the west he found
hawk feathers, and in the north speckled night bird (whippoorwill)
feathers. Etseastin and Etseasun carried these to a spring, placing them
toward the cardinal points. The eagle plumes were laid to the east and
near by them white corn and white shell; the blue feathers were laid to
the south with blue corn and turquoise; the hawk feathers were laid to
the west with yellow corn and abalone shell; and to the north were laid
the whippoorwill feathers with black beads and corn of all the several
colors. The old man and woman sang and prayed as they had done at the
spring in the lower world. They prayed to the east, and the white wolf
was created; to the south, and the otter appeared; to the west, and the
mountain lion came; and to the north, the beaver. Etseastin made these
animals rulers over the several points from which they came.</p>

When the white of daylight met the yellow of sunset in mid-heavens they
embraced, and white gave birth to the coyote; yellow to the yellow fox.
Blue of the south and black of the north similarly met, giving birth,
blue to blue fox and north to badger.</p>

<p>Blue and yellow foxes were given to the Pueblos; coyote and badger
remain with the Navajo; but Great Wolf is ruler over them all. Great
Wolf was the chief who counseled separation of the sexes.</p>

In the decoration of the bodies several men assisted, but the

they seemed quite fastidious. The fingers were dipped into the paint and

The Navajo will not use real blue coloring in their sand painting, but
adhere strictly to the instructions of the gods. They do, however, use a
