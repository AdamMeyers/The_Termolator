<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>THE REAL
THING.</h2>
<h3>I.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the porter&rsquo;s wife (she
used to answer the house-bell), announced &ldquo;A
gentleman&mdash;with a lady, sir,&rdquo; I had, as I often had in
those days, for the wish was father to the thought, an immediate
vision of sitters.&nbsp; Sitters my visitors in this case proved
to be; but not in the sense I should have preferred.&nbsp;
However, there was nothing at first to indicate that they might
not have come for a portrait.&nbsp; The gentleman, a man of
fifty, very high and very straight, with a moustache slightly
grizzled and a dark grey walking-coat admirably fitted, both of
which I noted professionally&mdash;I don&rsquo;t mean as a barber
or yet as a tailor&mdash;would have struck me as a celebrity if
celebrities often were striking.&nbsp; It was a truth of which I
had for some time been conscious that a figure with a good deal
of frontage was, as one might say, almost never a public
institution.&nbsp; A glance at the lady helped to remind me of
this paradoxical law: she also looked too distinguished to be a
&ldquo;personality.&rdquo;&nbsp; Moreover one would scarcely come
across two variations together.</p>
<p>Neither of the pair spoke immediately&mdash;they only
prolonged the preliminary gaze which suggested that each wished
to give the other a chance.&nbsp; They were visibly shy; they
stood there letting me take them in&mdash;which, as I afterwards
perceived, was the most practical thing they could have
done.&nbsp; In this way their embarrassment served their
cause.&nbsp; I had seen people painfully reluctant to mention
that they desired anything so gross as to be represented on
canvas; but the scruples of my new friends appeared almost
insurmountable.&nbsp; Yet the gentleman might have said &ldquo;I
should like a portrait of my wife,&rdquo; and the lady might have
said &ldquo;I should like a portrait of my husband.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Perhaps they were not husband and wife&mdash;this naturally would
make the matter more delicate.&nbsp; Perhaps they wished to be
done together&mdash;in which case they ought to have brought a
third person to break the news.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We come from Mr. Rivet,&rdquo; the lady said at last,
with a dim smile which had the effect of a moist sponge passed
over a &ldquo;sunk&rdquo; piece of painting, as well as of a
vague allusion to vanished beauty.&nbsp; She was as tall and
straight, in her degree, as her companion, and with ten years
less to carry.&nbsp; She looked as sad as a woman could look
whose face was not charged with expression; that is her tinted
oval mask showed friction as an exposed surface shows it.&nbsp;
The hand of time had played over her freely, but only to
simplify.&nbsp; She was slim and stiff, and so well-dressed, in
dark blue cloth, with lappets and pockets and buttons, that it
was clear she employed the same tailor as her husband.&nbsp; The
couple had an indefinable air of prosperous thrift&mdash;they
evidently got a good deal of luxury for their money.&nbsp; If I
was to be one of their luxuries it would behove me to consider my
terms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Claude Rivet recommended me?&rdquo; I inquired; and
I added that it was very kind of him, though I could reflect
that, as he only painted landscape, this was not a sacrifice.</p>
<p>The lady looked very hard at the gentleman, and the gentleman
looked round the room.&nbsp; Then staring at the floor a moment
and stroking his moustache, he rested his pleasant eyes on me
with the remark:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said you were the right one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I try to be, when people want to sit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we should like to,&rdquo; said the lady
anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean together?&rdquo;</p>
<p>My visitors exchanged a glance.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you could do
anything with <i>me</i>, I suppose it would be double,&rdquo; the
gentleman stammered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, there&rsquo;s naturally a higher charge for two
figures than for one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We should like to make it pay,&rdquo; the husband
confessed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very good of you,&rdquo; I returned,
appreciating so unwonted a sympathy&mdash;for I supposed he meant
pay the artist.</p>
<p>A sense of strangeness seemed to dawn on the lady.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We mean for the illustrations&mdash;Mr. Rivet said you
might put one in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put one in&mdash;an illustration?&rdquo; I was equally
confused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sketch her off, you know,&rdquo; said the gentleman,
colouring.</p>
<p>It was only then that I understood the service Claude Rivet
had rendered me; he had told them that I worked in black and
white, for magazines, for story-books, for sketches of
contemporary life, and consequently had frequent employment for
models.&nbsp; These things were true, but it was not less true (I
may confess it now&mdash;whether because the aspiration was to
lead to everything or to nothing I leave the reader to guess),
that I couldn&rsquo;t get the honours, to say nothing of the
emoluments, of a great painter of portraits out of my head.&nbsp;
My &ldquo;illustrations&rdquo; were my pot-boilers; I looked to a
different branch of art (far and away the most interesting it had
always seemed to me), to perpetuate my fame.&nbsp; There was no
shame in looking to it also to make my fortune; but that fortune
was by so much further from being made from the moment my
visitors wished to be &ldquo;done&rdquo; for nothing.&nbsp; I was
disappointed; for in the pictorial sense I had immediately
<i>seen</i> them.&nbsp; I had seized their type&mdash;I had
already settled what I would do with it.&nbsp; Something that
wouldn&rsquo;t absolutely have pleased them, I afterwards
reflected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,
you&rsquo;re&mdash;you&rsquo;re&mdash;a&mdash;?&rdquo; I began,
as soon as I had mastered my surprise.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t
bring out the dingy word &ldquo;models&rdquo;; it seemed to fit
the case so little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t had much practice,&rdquo; said the
lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to <i>do</i> something, and we&rsquo;ve
thought that an artist in your line might perhaps make something
of us,&rdquo; her husband threw off.&nbsp; He further mentioned
that they didn&rsquo;t know many artists and that they had gone
first, on the off-chance (he painted views of course, but
sometimes put in figures&mdash;perhaps I remembered), to Mr.
Rivet, whom they had met a few years before at a place in Norfolk
where he was sketching.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We used to sketch a little ourselves,&rdquo; the lady
hinted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very awkward, but we absolutely <i>must</i>
do something,&rdquo; her husband went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, we&rsquo;re not so <i>very</i> young,&rdquo;
she admitted, with a wan smile.</p>
<p>With the remark that I might as well know something more about
them, the husband had handed me a card extracted from a neat new
pocket-book (their appurtenances were all of the freshest) and
inscribed with the words &ldquo;Major Monarch.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Impressive as these words were they didn&rsquo;t carry my
knowledge much further; but my visitor presently added:
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve left the army, and we&rsquo;ve had the
misfortune to lose our money.&nbsp; In fact our means are
dreadfully small.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an awful bore,&rdquo; said Mrs. Monarch.</p>
<p>They evidently wished to be discreet&mdash;to take care not to
swagger because they were gentlefolks.&nbsp; I perceived they
would have been willing to recognise this as something of a
drawback, at the same time that I guessed at an underlying
sense&mdash;their consolation in adversity&mdash;that they
<i>had</i> their points.&nbsp; They certainly had; but these
advantages struck me as preponderantly social; such for instance
as would help to make a drawing-room look well.&nbsp; However, a
drawing-room was always, or ought to be, a picture.</p>
<p>In consequence of his wife&rsquo;s allusion to their age Major
Monarch observed: &ldquo;Naturally, it&rsquo;s more for the
figure that we thought of going in.&nbsp; We can still hold
ourselves up.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the instant I saw that the figure
was indeed their strong point.&nbsp; His &ldquo;naturally&rdquo;
didn&rsquo;t sound vain, but it lighted up the question.&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>She</i> has got the best,&rdquo; he continued, nodding
at his wife, with a pleasant after-dinner absence of
circumlocution.&nbsp; I could only reply, as if we were in fact
sitting over our wine, that this didn&rsquo;t prevent his own
from being very good; which led him in turn to rejoin: &ldquo;We
thought that if you ever have to do people like us, we might be
something like it.&nbsp; <i>She</i>, particularly&mdash;for a
lady in a book, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was so amused by them that, to get more of it, I did my best
to take their point of view; and though it was an embarrassment
to find myself appraising physically, as if they were animals on
hire or useful blacks, a pair whom I should have expected to meet
only in one of the relations in which criticism is tacit, I
looked at Mrs. Monarch judicially enough to be able to exclaim,
after a moment, with conviction: &ldquo;Oh yes, a lady in a
book!&rdquo;&nbsp; She was singularly like a bad
illustration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll stand up, if you like,&rdquo; said the
Major; and he raised himself before me with a really grand
air.</p>
<p>I could take his measure at a glance&mdash;he was six feet two
and a perfect gentleman.&nbsp; It would have paid any club in
process of formation and in want of a stamp to engage him at a
salary to stand in the principal window.&nbsp; What struck me
immediately was that in coming to me they had rather missed their
vocation; they could surely have been turned to better account
for advertising purposes.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t of course see
the thing in detail, but I could see them make someone&rsquo;s
fortune&mdash;I don&rsquo;t mean their own.&nbsp; There was
something in them for a waistcoat-maker, an hotel-keeper or a
soap-vendor.&nbsp; I could imagine &ldquo;We always use it&rdquo;
pinned on their bosoms with the greatest effect; I had a vision
of the promptitude with which they would launch a table
d&rsquo;h&ocirc;te.</p>
<p>Mrs. Monarch sat still, not from pride but from shyness, and
presently her husband said to her: &ldquo;Get up my dear and show
how smart you are.&rdquo;&nbsp; She obeyed, but she had no need
to get up to show it.&nbsp; She walked to the end of the studio,
and then she came back blushing, with her fluttered eyes on her
husband.&nbsp; I was reminded of an incident I had accidentally
had a glimpse of in Paris&mdash;being with a friend there, a
dramatist about to produce a play&mdash;when an actress came to
him to ask to be intrusted with a part.&nbsp; She went through
her paces before him, walked up and down as Mrs. Monarch was
doing.&nbsp; Mrs. Monarch did it quite as well, but I abstained
from applauding.&nbsp; It was very odd to see such people apply
for such poor pay.&nbsp; She looked as if she had ten thousand a
year.&nbsp; Her husband had used the word that described her: she
was, in the London current jargon, essentially and typically
&ldquo;smart.&rdquo;&nbsp; Her figure was, in the same order of
ideas, conspicuously and irreproachably &ldquo;good.&rdquo;&nbsp;
For a woman of her age her waist was surprisingly small; her
elbow moreover had the orthodox crook.&nbsp; She held her head at
the conventional angle; but why did she come to <i>me</i>?&nbsp;
She ought to have tried on jackets at a big shop.&nbsp; I feared
my visitors were not only destitute, but
&ldquo;artistic&rdquo;&mdash;which would be a great
complication.&nbsp; When she sat down again I thanked her,
observing that what a draughtsman most valued in his model was
the faculty of keeping quiet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>she</i> can keep quiet,&rdquo; said Major
Monarch.&nbsp; Then he added, jocosely: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always
kept her quiet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a nasty fidget, am I?&rdquo; Mrs. Monarch
appealed to her husband.</p>
<p>He addressed his answer to me.&nbsp; &ldquo;Perhaps it
isn&rsquo;t out of place to mention&mdash;because we ought to be
quite business-like, oughtn&rsquo;t we?&mdash;that when I married
her she was known as the Beautiful Statue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear!&rdquo; said Mrs. Monarch, ruefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I should want a certain amount of
expression,&rdquo; I rejoined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of <i>course</i>!&rdquo; they both exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then I suppose you know that you&rsquo;ll get
awfully tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we <i>never</i> get tired!&rdquo; they eagerly
cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you had any kind of practice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They hesitated&mdash;they looked at each other.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been photographed, <i>immensely</i>,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Monarch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She means the fellows have asked us,&rdquo; added the
Major.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see&mdash;because you&rsquo;re so
good-looking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what they thought, but they were
always after us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We always got our photographs for nothing,&rdquo;
smiled Mrs. Monarch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might have brought some, my dear,&rdquo; her husband
remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure we have any left.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve
given quantities away,&rdquo; she explained to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With our autographs and that sort of thing,&rdquo; said
the Major.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are they to be got in the shops?&rdquo; I inquired, as
a harmless pleasantry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes; hers&mdash;they used to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not now,&rdquo; said Mrs. Monarch, with her eyes on the
floor.</p>
<h3>II.</h3>
<p>I <span class="smcap">could</span> fancy the &ldquo;sort of
thing&rdquo; they put on the presentation-copies of their
photographs, and I was sure they wrote a beautiful hand.&nbsp; It
was odd how quickly I was sure of everything that concerned
them.&nbsp; If they were now so poor as to have to earn shillings
and pence, they never had had much of a margin.&nbsp; Their good
looks had been their capital, and they had good-humouredly made
the most of the career that this resource marked out for
them.&nbsp; It was in their faces, the blankness, the deep
intellectual repose of the twenty years of country-house visiting
which had given them pleasant intonations.&nbsp; I could see the
sunny drawing-rooms, sprinkled with periodicals she didn&rsquo;t
read, in which Mrs. Monarch had continuously sat; I could see the
wet shrubberies in which she had walked, equipped to admiration
for either exercise.&nbsp; I could see the rich covers the Major
had helped to shoot and the wonderful garments in which, late at
night, he repaired to the smoking-room to talk about them.&nbsp;
I could imagine their leggings and waterproofs, their knowing
tweeds and rugs, their rolls of sticks and cases of tackle and
neat umbrellas; and I could evoke the exact appearance of their
servants and the compact variety of their luggage on the
platforms of country stations.</p>
<p>They gave small tips, but they were liked; they didn&rsquo;t
do anything themselves, but they were welcome.&nbsp; They looked
so well everywhere; they gratified the general relish for
stature, complexion and &ldquo;form.&rdquo;&nbsp; They knew it
without fatuity or vulgarity, and they respected themselves in
consequence.&nbsp; They were not superficial; they were thorough
and kept themselves up&mdash;it had been their line.&nbsp; People
with such a taste for activity had to have some line.&nbsp; I
could feel how, even in a dull house, they could have been
counted upon for cheerfulness.&nbsp; At present something had
happened&mdash;it didn&rsquo;t matter what, their little income
had grown less, it had grown least&mdash;and they had to do
something for pocket-money.&nbsp; Their friends liked them, but
didn&rsquo;t like to support them.&nbsp; There was something
about them that represented credit&mdash;their clothes, their
manners, their type; but if credit is a large empty pocket in
which an occasional chink reverberates, the chink at least must
be audible.&nbsp; What they wanted of me was to help to make it
so.&nbsp; Fortunately they had no children&mdash;I soon divined
that.&nbsp; They would also perhaps wish our relations to be kept
secret: this was why it was &ldquo;for the
figure&rdquo;&mdash;the reproduction of the face would betray
them.</p>
<p>I liked them&mdash;they were so simple; and I had no objection
to them if they would suit.&nbsp; But, somehow, with all their
perfections I didn&rsquo;t easily believe in them.&nbsp; After
all they were amateurs, and the ruling passion of my life was the
detestation of the amateur.&nbsp; Combined with this was another
perversity&mdash;an innate preference for the represented subject
over the real one: the defect of the real one was so apt to be a
lack of representation.&nbsp; I liked things that appeared; then
one was sure.&nbsp; Whether they <i>were</i> or not was a
subordinate and almost always a profitless question.&nbsp; There
were other considerations, the first of which was that I already
had two or three people in use, notably a young person with big
feet, in alpaca, from Kilburn, who for a couple of years had come
to me regularly for my illustrations and with whom I was
still&mdash;perhaps ignobly&mdash;satisfied.&nbsp; I frankly
explained to my visitors how the case stood; but they had taken
more precautions than I supposed.&nbsp; They had reasoned out
their opportunity, for Claude Rivet had told them of the
projected <i>&eacute;dition de luxe</i> of one of the writers of
our day&mdash;the rarest of the novelists&mdash;who, long
neglected by the multitudinous vulgar and dearly prized by the
attentive (need I mention Philip Vincent?) had had the happy
fortune of seeing, late in life, the dawn and then the full light
of a higher criticism&mdash;an estimate in which, on the part of
the public, there was something really of expiation.&nbsp; The
edition in question, planned by a publisher of taste, was
practically an act of high reparation; the wood-cuts with which
it was to be enriched were the homage of English art to one of
the most independent representatives of English letters.&nbsp;
Major and Mrs. Monarch confessed to me that they had hoped I
might be able to work <i>them</i> into my share of the
enterprise.&nbsp; They knew I was to do the first of the books,
&ldquo;Rutland Ramsay,&rdquo; but I had to make clear to them
that my participation in the rest of the affair&mdash;this first
book was to be a test&mdash;was to depend on the satisfaction I
should give.&nbsp; If this should be limited my employers would
drop me without a scruple.&nbsp; It was therefore a crisis for
me, and naturally I was making special preparations, looking
about for new people, if they should be necessary, and securing
the best types.&nbsp; I admitted however that I should like to
settle down to two or three good models who would do for
everything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Should we have often to&mdash;a&mdash;put on special
clothes?&rdquo; Mrs. Monarch timidly demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear, yes&mdash;that&rsquo;s half the
business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And should we be expected to supply our own
costumes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no; I&rsquo;ve got a lot of things.&nbsp; A
painter&rsquo;s models put on&mdash;or put off&mdash;anything he
likes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you mean&mdash;a&mdash;the same?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Monarch looked at her husband again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, she was just wondering,&rdquo; he explained,
&ldquo;if the costumes are in <i>general</i> use.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
had to confess that they were, and I mentioned further that some
of them (I had a lot of genuine, greasy last-century things), had
served their time, a hundred years ago, on living, world-stained
men and women.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll put on anything that
fits,&rdquo; said the Major.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I arrange that&mdash;they fit in the
pictures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I should do better for the modern
books.&nbsp; I would come as you like,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Monarch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has got a lot of clothes at home: they might do for
contemporary life,&rdquo; her husband continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I can fancy scenes in which you&rsquo;d be quite
natural.&rdquo;&nbsp; And indeed I could see the slipshod
rearrangements of stale properties&mdash;the stories I tried to
produce pictures for without the exasperation of reading
them&mdash;whose sandy tracts the good lady might help to
people.&nbsp; But I had to return to the fact that for this sort
of work&mdash;the daily mechanical grind&mdash;I was already
equipped; the people I was working with were fully adequate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We only thought we might be more like <i>some</i>
characters,&rdquo; said Mrs. Monarch mildly, getting up.</p>
<p>Her husband also rose; he stood looking at me with a dim
wistfulness that was touching in so fine a man.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be rather a pull sometimes to
have&mdash;a&mdash;to have&mdash;?&rdquo;&nbsp; He hung fire; he
wanted me to help him by phrasing what he meant.&nbsp; But I
couldn&rsquo;t&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; So he brought it
out, awkwardly: &ldquo;The <i>real</i> thing; a gentleman, you
know, or a lady.&rdquo;&nbsp; I was quite ready to give a general
assent&mdash;I admitted that there was a great deal in
that.&nbsp; This encouraged Major Monarch to say, following up
his appeal with an unacted gulp: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s awfully
hard&mdash;we&rsquo;ve tried everything.&rdquo;&nbsp; The gulp
was communicative; it proved too much for his wife.&nbsp; Before
I knew it Mrs. Monarch had dropped again upon a divan and burst
into tears.&nbsp; Her husband sat down beside her, holding one of
her hands; whereupon she quickly dried her eyes with the other,
while I felt embarrassed as she looked up at me.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t a confounded job I haven&rsquo;t applied
for&mdash;waited for&mdash;prayed for.&nbsp; You can fancy
we&rsquo;d be pretty bad first.&nbsp; Secretaryships and that
sort of thing?&nbsp; You might as well ask for a peerage.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;d be <i>anything</i>&mdash;I&rsquo;m strong; a messenger
or a coalheaver.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d put on a gold-laced cap and open
carriage-doors in front of the haberdasher&rsquo;s; I&rsquo;d
hang about a station, to carry portmanteaus; I&rsquo;d be a
postman.&nbsp; But they won&rsquo;t <i>look</i> at you; there are
thousands, as good as yourself, already on the ground.&nbsp;
<i>Gentlemen</i>, poor beggars, who have drunk their wine, who
have kept their hunters!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was as reassuring as I knew how to be, and my visitors were
presently on their feet again while, for the experiment, we
agreed on an hour.&nbsp; We were discussing it when the door
opened and Miss Churm came in with a wet umbrella.&nbsp; Miss
Churm had to take the omnibus to Maida Vale and then walk
half-a-mile.&nbsp; She looked a trifle blowsy and slightly
splashed.&nbsp; I scarcely ever saw her come in without thinking
afresh how odd it was that, being so little in herself, she
should yet be so much in others.&nbsp; She was a meagre little
Miss Churm, but she was an ample heroine of romance.&nbsp; She
was only a freckled cockney, but she could represent everything,
from a fine lady to a shepherdess; she had the faculty, as she
might have had a fine voice or long hair.</p>
<p>She couldn&rsquo;t spell, and she loved beer, but she had two
or three &ldquo;points,&rdquo; and practice, and a knack, and
mother-wit, and a kind of whimsical sensibility, and a love of
the theatre, and seven sisters, and not an ounce of respect,
especially for the <i>h</i>.&nbsp; The first thing my visitors
saw was that her umbrella was wet, and in their spotless
perfection they visibly winced at it.&nbsp; The rain had come on
since their arrival.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all in a soak; there <i>was</i> a mess of
people in the &rsquo;bus.&nbsp; I wish you lived near a
stytion,&rdquo; said Miss Churm.&nbsp; I requested her to get
ready as quickly as possible, and she passed into the room in
which she always changed her dress.&nbsp; But before going out
she asked me what she was to get into this time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Russian princess, don&rsquo;t you
know?&rdquo; I answered; &ldquo;the one with the &lsquo;golden
eyes,&rsquo; in black velvet, for the long thing in the
<i>Cheapside</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Golden eyes?&nbsp; I <i>say</i>!&rdquo; cried Miss
Churm, while my companions watched her with intensity as she
withdrew.&nbsp; She always arranged herself, when she was late,
before I could turn round; and I kept my visitors a little, on
purpose, so that they might get an idea, from seeing her, what
would be expected of themselves.&nbsp; I mentioned that she was
quite my notion of an excellent model&mdash;she was really very
clever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think she looks like a Russian princess?&rdquo;
Major Monarch asked, with lurking alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I make her, yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, if you have to <i>make</i> her&mdash;!&rdquo; he
reasoned, acutely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the most you can ask.&nbsp; There are so
many that are not makeable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well now, <i>here&rsquo;s</i> a lady&rdquo;&mdash;and
with a persuasive smile he passed his arm into his
wife&rsquo;s&mdash;&ldquo;who&rsquo;s already made!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m not a Russian princess,&rdquo; Mrs.
Monarch protested, a little coldly.&nbsp; I could see that she
had known some and didn&rsquo;t like them.&nbsp; There,
immediately, was a complication of a kind that I never had to
fear with Miss Churm.</p>
<p>This young lady came back in black velvet&mdash;the gown was
rather rusty and very low on her lean shoulders&mdash;and with a
Japanese fan in her red hands.&nbsp; I reminded her that in the
scene I was doing she had to look over someone&rsquo;s
head.&nbsp; &ldquo;I forget whose it is; but it doesn&rsquo;t
matter.&nbsp; Just look over a head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather look over a stove,&rdquo; said Miss
Churm; and she took her station near the fire.&nbsp; She fell
into position, settled herself into a tall attitude, gave a
certain backward inclination to her head and a certain forward
droop to her fan, and looked, at least to my prejudiced sense,
distinguished and charming, foreign and dangerous.&nbsp; We left
her looking so, while I went down-stairs with Major and Mrs.
Monarch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I could come about as near it as that,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Monarch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you think she&rsquo;s shabby, but you must allow
for the alchemy of art.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, they went off with an evident increase of comfort,
founded on their demonstrable advantage in being the real
thing.&nbsp; I could fancy them shuddering over Miss Churm.&nbsp;
She was very droll about them when I went back, for I told her
what they wanted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if <i>she</i> can sit I&rsquo;ll tyke to
bookkeeping,&rdquo; said my model.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s very lady-like,&rdquo; I replied, as an
innocent form of aggravation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So much the worse for <i>you</i>.&nbsp; That means she
can&rsquo;t turn round.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll do for the fashionable novels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, she&rsquo;ll <i>do</i> for them!&rdquo; my
model humorously declared.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t they had
enough without her?&rdquo; I had often sociably denounced them to
Miss Churm.</p>
<h3>III.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was for the elucidation of a
mystery in one of these works that I first tried Mrs.
Monarch.&nbsp; Her husband came with her, to be useful if
necessary&mdash;it was sufficiently clear that as a general thing
he would prefer to come with her.&nbsp; At first I wondered if
this were for &ldquo;propriety&rsquo;s&rdquo; sake&mdash;if he
were going to be jealous and meddling.&nbsp; The idea was too
tiresome, and if it had been confirmed it would speedily have
brought our acquaintance to a close.&nbsp; But I soon saw there
was nothing in it and that if he accompanied Mrs. Monarch it was
(in addition to the chance of being wanted), simply because he
had nothing else to do.&nbsp; When she was away from him his
occupation was gone&mdash;she never <i>had</i> been away from
him.&nbsp; I judged, rightly, that in their awkward situation
their close union was their main comfort and that this union had
no weak spot.&nbsp; It was a real marriage, an encouragement to
the hesitating, a nut for pessimists to crack.&nbsp; Their
address was humble (I remember afterwards thinking it had been
the only thing about them that was really professional), and I
could fancy the lamentable lodgings in which the Major would have
been left alone.&nbsp; He could bear them with his wife&mdash;he
couldn&rsquo;t bear them without her.</p>
<p>He had too much tact to try and make himself agreeable when he
couldn&rsquo;t be useful; so he simply sat and waited, when I was
too absorbed in my work to talk.&nbsp; But I liked to make him
talk&mdash;it made my work, when it didn&rsquo;t interrupt it,
less sordid, less special.&nbsp; To listen to him was to combine
the excitement of going out with the economy of staying at
home.&nbsp; There was only one hindrance: that I seemed not to
know any of the people he and his wife had known.&nbsp; I think
he wondered extremely, during the term of our intercourse, whom
the deuce I <i>did</i> know.&nbsp; He hadn&rsquo;t a stray
sixpence of an idea to fumble for; so we didn&rsquo;t spin it
very fine&mdash;we confined ourselves to questions of leather and
even of liquor (saddlers and breeches-makers and how to get good
claret cheap), and matters like &ldquo;good trains&rdquo; and the
habits of small game.&nbsp; His lore on these last subjects was
astonishing, he managed to interweave the station-master with the
ornithologist.&nbsp; When he couldn&rsquo;t talk about greater
things he could talk cheerfully about smaller, and since I
couldn&rsquo;t accompany him into reminiscences of the
fashionable world he could lower the conversation without a
visible effort to my level.</p>
<p>So earnest a desire to please was touching in a man who could
so easily have knocked one down.&nbsp; He looked after the fire
and had an opinion on the draught of the stove, without my asking
him, and I could see that he thought many of my arrangements not
half clever enough.&nbsp; I remember telling him that if I were
only rich I would offer him a salary to come and teach me how to
live.&nbsp; Sometimes he gave a random sigh, of which the essence
was: &ldquo;Give me even such a bare old barrack as <i>this</i>,
and I&rsquo;d do something with it!&rdquo;&nbsp; When I wanted to
use him he came alone; which was an illustration of the superior
courage of women.&nbsp; His wife could bear her solitary second
floor, and she was in general more discreet; showing by various
small reserves that she was alive to the propriety of keeping our
relations markedly professional&mdash;not letting them slide into
sociability.&nbsp; She wished it to remain clear that she and the
Major were employed, not cultivated, and if she approved of me as
a superior, who could be kept in his place, she never thought me
quite good enough for an equal.</p>
<p>She sat with great intensity, giving the whole of her mind to
it, and was capable of remaining for an hour almost as motionless
as if she were before a photographer&rsquo;s lens.&nbsp; I could
see she had been photographed often, but somehow the very habit
that made her good for that purpose unfitted her for mine.&nbsp;
At first I was extremely pleased with her lady-like air, and it
was a satisfaction, on coming to follow her lines, to see how
good they were and how far they could lead the pencil.&nbsp; But
after a few times I began to find her too insurmountably stiff;
do what I would with it my drawing looked like a photograph or a
copy of a photograph.&nbsp; Her figure had no variety of
expression&mdash;she herself had no sense of variety.&nbsp; You
may say that this was my business, was only a question of placing
her.&nbsp; I placed her in every conceivable position, but she
managed to obliterate their differences.&nbsp; She was always a
lady certainly, and into the bargain was always the same
lady.&nbsp; She was the real thing, but always the same
thing.&nbsp; There were moments when I was oppressed by the
serenity of her confidence that she <i>was</i> the real
thing.&nbsp; All her dealings with me and all her husband&rsquo;s
were an implication that this was lucky for <i>me</i>.&nbsp;
Meanwhile I found myself trying to invent types that approached
her own, instead of making her own transform itself&mdash;in the
clever way that was not impossible, for instance, to poor Miss
Churm.&nbsp; Arrange as I would and take the precautions I would,
she always, in my pictures, came out too tall&mdash;landing me in
the dilemma of having represented a fascinating woman as seven
feet high, which, out of respect perhaps to my own very much
scantier inches, was far from my idea of such a personage.</p>
<p>The case was worse with the Major&mdash;nothing I could do
would keep <i>him</i> down, so that he became useful only for the
representation of brawny giants.&nbsp; I adored variety and
range, I cherished human accidents, the illustrative note; I
wanted to characterise closely, and the thing in the world I most
hated was the danger of being ridden by a type.&nbsp; I had
quarrelled with some of my friends about it&mdash;I had parted
company with them for maintaining that one <i>had</i> to be, and
that if the type was beautiful (witness Raphael and Leonardo),
the servitude was only a gain.&nbsp; I was neither Leonardo nor
Raphael; I might only be a presumptuous young modern searcher,
but I held that everything was to be sacrificed sooner than
character.&nbsp; When they averred that the haunting type in
question could easily <i>be</i> character, I retorted, perhaps
superficially: &ldquo;Whose?&rdquo;&nbsp; It couldn&rsquo;t be
everybody&rsquo;s&mdash;it might end in being nobody&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>After I had drawn Mrs. Monarch a dozen times I perceived more
clearly than before that the value of such a model as Miss Churm
resided precisely in the fact that she had no positive stamp,
combined of course with the other fact that what she did have was
a curious and inexplicable talent for imitation.&nbsp; Her usual
appearance was like a curtain which she could draw up at request
for a capital performance.&nbsp; This performance was simply
suggestive; but it was a word to the wise&mdash;it was vivid and
pretty.&nbsp; Sometimes, even, I thought it, though she was plain
herself, too insipidly pretty; I made it a reproach to her that
the figures drawn from her were monotonously
(<i>b&ecirc;tement</i>, as we used to say) graceful.&nbsp;
Nothing made her more angry: it was so much her pride to feel
that she could sit for characters that had nothing in common with
each other.&nbsp; She would accuse me at such moments of taking
away her &ldquo;reputytion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It suffered a certain shrinkage, this queer quantity, from the
repeated visits of my new friends.&nbsp; Miss Churm was greatly
in demand, never in want of employment, so I had no scruple in
putting her off occasionally, to try them more at my ease.&nbsp;
It was certainly amusing at first to do the real thing&mdash;it
was amusing to do Major Monarch&rsquo;s trousers.&nbsp; They
<i>were</i> the real thing, even if he did come out
colossal.&nbsp; It was amusing to do his wife&rsquo;s back hair
(it was so mathematically neat,) and the particular
&ldquo;smart&rdquo; tension of her tight stays.&nbsp; She lent
herself especially to positions in which the face was somewhat
averted or blurred; she abounded in lady-like back views and
<i>profils perdus</i>.&nbsp; When she stood erect she took
naturally one of the attitudes in which court-painters represent
queens and princesses; so that I found myself wondering whether,
to draw out this accomplishment, I couldn&rsquo;t get the editor
of the <i>Cheapside</i> to publish a really royal romance,
&ldquo;A Tale of Buckingham Palace.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sometimes,
however, the real thing and the make-believe came into contact;
by which I mean that Miss Churm, keeping an appointment or coming
to make one on days when I had much work in hand, encountered her
invidious rivals.&nbsp; The encounter was not on their part, for
they noticed her no more than if she had been the housemaid; not
from intentional loftiness, but simply because, as yet,
professionally, they didn&rsquo;t know how to fraternise, as I
could guess that they would have liked&mdash;or at least that the
Major would.&nbsp; They couldn&rsquo;t talk about the
omnibus&mdash;they always walked; and they didn&rsquo;t know what
else to try&mdash;she wasn&rsquo;t interested in good trains or
cheap claret.&nbsp; Besides, they must have felt&mdash;in the
air&mdash;that she was amused at them, secretly derisive of their
ever knowing how.&nbsp; She was not a person to conceal her
scepticism if she had had a chance to show it.&nbsp; On the other
hand Mrs. Monarch didn&rsquo;t think her tidy; for why else did
she take pains to say to me (it was going out of the way, for
Mrs. Monarch), that she didn&rsquo;t like dirty women?</p>
<p>One day when my young lady happened to be present with my
other sitters (she even dropped in, when it was convenient, for a
chat), I asked her to be so good as to lend a hand in getting
tea&mdash;a service with which she was familiar and which was one
of a class that, living as I did in a small way, with slender
domestic resources, I often appealed to my models to
render.&nbsp; They liked to lay hands on my property, to break
the sitting, and sometimes the china&mdash;I made them feel
Bohemian.&nbsp; The next time I saw Miss Churm after this
incident she surprised me greatly by making a scene about
it&mdash;she accused me of having wished to humiliate her.&nbsp;
She had not resented the outrage at the time, but had seemed
obliging and amused, enjoying the comedy of asking Mrs. Monarch,
who sat vague and silent, whether she would have cream and sugar,
and putting an exaggerated simper into the question.&nbsp; She
had tried intonations&mdash;as if she too wished to pass for the
real thing; till I was afraid my other visitors would take
offence.</p>
<p>Oh, <i>they</i> were determined not to do this; and their
touching patience was the measure of their great need.&nbsp; They
would sit by the hour, uncomplaining, till I was ready to use
them; they would come back on the chance of being wanted and
would walk away cheerfully if they were not.&nbsp; I used to go
to the door with them to see in what magnificent order they
retreated.&nbsp; I tried to find other employment for
them&mdash;I introduced them to several artists.&nbsp; But they
didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;take,&rdquo; for reasons I could appreciate,
and I became conscious, rather anxiously, that after such
disappointments they fell back upon me with a heavier
weight.&nbsp; They did me the honour to think that it was I who
was most <i>their</i> form.&nbsp; They were not picturesque
enough for the painters, and in those days there were not so many
serious workers in black and white.&nbsp; Besides, they had an
eye to the great job I had mentioned to them&mdash;they had
secretly set their hearts on supplying the right essence for my
pictorial vindication of our fine novelist.&nbsp; They knew that
for this undertaking I should want no costume-effects, none of
the frippery of past ages&mdash;that it was a case in which
everything would be contemporary and satirical and, presumably,
genteel.&nbsp; If I could work them into it their future would be
assured, for the labour would of course be long and the
occupation steady.</p>
<p>One day Mrs. Monarch came without her husband&mdash;she
explained his absence by his having had to go to the City.&nbsp;
While she sat there in her usual anxious stiffness there came, at
the door, a knock which I immediately recognised as the subdued
appeal of a model out of work.&nbsp; It was followed by the
entrance of a young man whom I easily perceived to be a foreigner
and who proved in fact an Italian acquainted with no English word
but my name, which he uttered in a way that made it seem to
include all others.&nbsp; I had not then visited his country, nor
was I proficient in his tongue; but as he was not so meanly
constituted&mdash;what Italian is?&mdash;as to depend only on
that member for expression he conveyed to me, in familiar but
graceful mimicry, that he was in search of exactly the employment
in which the lady before me was engaged.&nbsp; I was not struck
with him at first, and while I continued to draw I emitted rough
sounds of discouragement and dismissal.&nbsp; He stood his
ground, however, not importunately, but with a dumb, dog-like
fidelity in his eyes which amounted to innocent
impudence&mdash;the manner of a devoted servant (he might have
been in the house for years), unjustly suspected.&nbsp; Suddenly
I saw that this very attitude and expression made a picture,
whereupon I told him to sit down and wait till I should be
free.&nbsp; There was another picture in the way he obeyed me,
and I observed as I worked that there were others still in the
way he looked wonderingly, with his head thrown back, about the
high studio.&nbsp; He might have been crossing himself in St.
Peter&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Before I finished I said to myself:
&ldquo;The fellow&rsquo;s a bankrupt orange-monger, but
he&rsquo;s a treasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Mrs. Monarch withdrew he passed across the room like a
flash to open the door for her, standing there with the rapt,
pure gaze of the young Dante spellbound by the young
Beatrice.&nbsp; As I never insisted, in such situations, on the
blankness of the British domestic, I reflected that he had the
making of a servant (and I needed one, but couldn&rsquo;t pay him
to be only that), as well as of a model; in short I made up my
mind to adopt my bright adventurer if he would agree to officiate
in the double capacity.&nbsp; He jumped at my offer, and in the
event my rashness (for I had known nothing about him), was not
brought home to me.&nbsp; He proved a sympathetic though a
desultory ministrant, and had in a wonderful degree the
<i>sentiment de la pose</i>.&nbsp; It was uncultivated,
instinctive; a part of the happy instinct which had guided him to
my door and helped him to spell out my name on the card nailed to
it.&nbsp; He had had no other introduction to me than a guess,
from the shape of my high north window, seen outside, that my
place was a studio and that as a studio it would contain an
artist.&nbsp; He had wandered to England in search of fortune,
like other itinerants, and had embarked, with a partner and a
small green handcart, on the sale of penny ices.&nbsp; The ices
had melted away and the partner had dissolved in their
train.&nbsp; My young man wore tight yellow trousers with reddish
stripes and his name was Oronte.&nbsp; He was sallow but fair,
and when I put him into some old clothes of my own he looked like
an Englishman.&nbsp; He was as good as Miss Churm, who could
look, when required, like an Italian.</p>
<h3>IV.</h3>
<p>I <span class="smcap">thought</span> Mrs. Monarch&rsquo;s face
slightly convulsed when, on her coming back with her husband, she
found Oronte installed.&nbsp; It was strange to have to recognise
in a scrap of a lazzarone a competitor to her magnificent
Major.&nbsp; It was she who scented danger first, for the Major
was anecdotically unconscious.&nbsp; But Oronte gave us tea, with
a hundred eager confusions (he had never seen such a queer
process), and I think she thought better of me for having at last
an &ldquo;establishment.&rdquo;&nbsp; They saw a couple of
drawings that I had made of the establishment, and Mrs. Monarch
hinted that it never would have struck her that he had sat for
them.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now the drawings you make from <i>us</i>, they
look exactly like us,&rdquo; she reminded me, smiling in triumph;
and I recognised that this was indeed just their defect.&nbsp;
When I drew the Monarchs I couldn&rsquo;t, somehow, get away from
them&mdash;get into the character I wanted to represent; and I
had not the least desire my model should be discoverable in my
picture.&nbsp; Miss Churm never was, and Mrs. Monarch thought I
hid her, very properly, because she was vulgar; whereas if she
was lost it was only as the dead who go to heaven are
lost&mdash;in the gain of an angel the more.</p>
<p>By this time I had got a certain start with &ldquo;Rutland
Ramsay,&rdquo; the first novel in the great projected series;
that is I had produced a dozen drawings, several with the help of
the Major and his wife, and I had sent them in for
approval.&nbsp; My understanding with the publishers, as I have
already hinted, had been that I was to be left to do my work, in
this particular case, as I liked, with the whole book committed
to me; but my connection with the rest of the series was only
contingent.&nbsp; There were moments when, frankly, it <i>was</i>
a comfort to have the real thing under one&rsquo;s hand; for
there were characters in &ldquo;Rutland Ramsay&rdquo; that were
very much like it.&nbsp; There were people presumably as straight
as the Major and women of as good a fashion as Mrs.
Monarch.&nbsp; There was a great deal of country-house
life&mdash;treated, it is true, in a fine, fanciful, ironical,
generalised way&mdash;and there was a considerable implication of
knickerbockers and kilts.&nbsp; There were certain things I had
to settle at the outset; such things for instance as the exact
appearance of the hero, the particular bloom of the
heroine.&nbsp; The author of course gave me a lead, but there was
a margin for interpretation.&nbsp; I took the Monarchs into my
confidence, I told them frankly what I was about, I mentioned my
embarrassments and alternatives.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, take
<i>him</i>!&rdquo; Mrs. Monarch murmured sweetly, looking at her
husband; and &ldquo;What could you want better than my
wife?&rdquo; the Major inquired, with the comfortable candour
that now prevailed between us.</p>
<p>I was not obliged to answer these remarks&mdash;I was only
obliged to place my sitters.&nbsp; I was not easy in mind, and I
postponed, a little timidly perhaps, the solution of the
question.&nbsp; The book was a large canvas, the other figures
were numerous, and I worked off at first some of the episodes in
which the hero and the heroine were not concerned.&nbsp; When
once I had set <i>them</i> up I should have to stick to
them&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t make my young man seven feet high in
one place and five feet nine in another.&nbsp; I inclined on the
whole to the latter measurement, though the Major more than once
reminded me that <i>he</i> looked about as young as anyone.&nbsp;
It was indeed quite possible to arrange him, for the figure, so
that it would have been difficult to detect his age.&nbsp; After
the spontaneous Oronte had been with me a month, and after I had
given him to understand several different times that his native
exuberance would presently constitute an insurmountable barrier
to our further intercourse, I waked to a sense of his heroic
capacity.&nbsp; He was only five feet seven, but the remaining
inches were latent.&nbsp; I tried him almost secretly at first,
for I was really rather afraid of the judgment my other models
would pass on such a choice.&nbsp; If they regarded Miss Churm as
little better than a snare, what would they think of the
representation by a person so little the real thing as an Italian
street-vendor of a protagonist formed by a public school?</p>
<p>If I went a little in fear of them it was not because they
bullied me, because they had got an oppressive foothold, but
because in their really pathetic decorum and mysteriously
permanent newness they counted on me so intensely.&nbsp; I was
therefore very glad when Jack Hawley came home: he was always of
such good counsel.&nbsp; He painted badly himself, but there was
no one like him for putting his finger on the place.&nbsp; He had
been absent from England for a year; he had been
somewhere&mdash;I don&rsquo;t remember where&mdash;to get a fresh
eye.&nbsp; I was in a good deal of dread of any such organ, but
we were old friends; he had been away for months and a sense of
emptiness was creeping into my life.&nbsp; I hadn&rsquo;t dodged
a missile for a year.</p>
<p>He came back with a fresh eye, but with the same old black
velvet blouse, and the first evening he spent in my studio we
smoked cigarettes till the small hours.&nbsp; He had done no work
himself, he had only got the eye; so the field was clear for the
production of my little things.&nbsp; He wanted to see what I had
done for the <i>Cheapside</i>, but he was disappointed in the
exhibition.&nbsp; That at least seemed the meaning of two or
three comprehensive groans which, as he lounged on my big divan,
on a folded leg, looking at my latest drawings, issued from his
lips with the smoke of the cigarette.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with <i>you</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing save that I&rsquo;m mystified.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are indeed.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re quite off the
hinge.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the meaning of this new fad?&rdquo; And
he tossed me, with visible irreverence, a drawing in which I
happened to have depicted both my majestic models.&nbsp; I asked
if he didn&rsquo;t think it good, and he replied that it struck
him as execrable, given the sort of thing I had always
represented myself to him as wishing to arrive at; but I let that
pass, I was so anxious to see exactly what he meant.&nbsp; The
two figures in the picture looked colossal, but I supposed this
was <i>not</i> what he meant, inasmuch as, for aught he knew to
the contrary, I might have been trying for that.&nbsp; I
maintained that I was working exactly in the same way as when he
last had done me the honour to commend me.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,
there&rsquo;s a big hole somewhere,&rdquo; he answered;
&ldquo;wait a bit and I&rsquo;ll discover it.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
depended upon him to do so: where else was the fresh eye?&nbsp;
But he produced at last nothing more luminous than &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know&mdash;I don&rsquo;t like your
types.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was lame, for a critic who had never
consented to discuss with me anything but the question of
execution, the direction of strokes and the mystery of
values.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the drawings you&rsquo;ve been looking at I think my
types are very handsome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they won&rsquo;t do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had a couple of new models.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see you have.&nbsp; <i>They</i> won&rsquo;t
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you very sure of that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely&mdash;they&rsquo;re stupid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean <i>I</i> am&mdash;for I ought to get round
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You <i>can&rsquo;t</i>&mdash;with such people.&nbsp;
Who are they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I told him, as far as was necessary, and he declared,
heartlessly: &ldquo;<i>Ce sont des gens qu&rsquo;il faut mettre
&agrave; la porte</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve never seen them; they&rsquo;re awfully
good,&rdquo; I compassionately objected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not seen them?&nbsp; Why, all this recent work of yours
drops to pieces with them.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s all I want to see of
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one else has said anything against it&mdash;the
<i>Cheapside</i> people are pleased.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everyone else is an ass, and the <i>Cheapside</i>
people the biggest asses of all.&nbsp; Come, don&rsquo;t pretend,
at this time of day, to have pretty illusions about the public,
especially about publishers and editors.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not for
<i>such</i> animals you work&mdash;it&rsquo;s for those who know,
<i>coloro che sanno</i>; so keep straight for <i>me</i> if you
can&rsquo;t keep straight for yourself.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a
certain sort of thing you tried for from the first&mdash;and a
very good thing it is.&nbsp; But this twaddle isn&rsquo;t
<i>in</i> it.&rdquo;&nbsp; When I talked with Hawley later about
&ldquo;Rutland Ramsay&rdquo; and its possible successors he
declared that I must get back into my boat again or I would go to
the bottom.&nbsp; His voice in short was the voice of
warning.</p>
<p>I noted the warning, but I didn&rsquo;t turn my friends out of
doors.&nbsp; They bored me a good deal; but the very fact that
they bored me admonished me not to sacrifice them&mdash;if there
was anything to be done with them&mdash;simply to
irritation.&nbsp; As I look back at this phase they seem to me to
have pervaded my life not a little.&nbsp; I have a vision of them
as most of the time in my studio, seated, against the wall, on an
old velvet bench to be out of the way, and looking like a pair of
patient courtiers in a royal ante-chamber.&nbsp; I am convinced
that during the coldest weeks of the winter they held their
ground because it saved them fire.&nbsp; Their newness was losing
its gloss, and it was impossible not to feel that they were
objects of charity.&nbsp; Whenever Miss Churm arrived they went
away, and after I was fairly launched in &ldquo;Rutland
Ramsay&rdquo; Miss Churm arrived pretty often.&nbsp; They managed
to express to me tacitly that they supposed I wanted her for the
low life of the book, and I let them suppose it, since they had
attempted to study the work&mdash;it was lying about the
studio&mdash;without discovering that it dealt only with the
highest circles.&nbsp; They had dipped into the most brilliant of
our novelists without deciphering many passages.&nbsp; I still
took an hour from them, now and again, in spite of Jack
Hawley&rsquo;s warning: it would be time enough to dismiss them,
if dismissal should be necessary, when the rigour of the season
was over.&nbsp; Hawley had made their acquaintance&mdash;he had
met them at my fireside&mdash;and thought them a ridiculous
pair.&nbsp; Learning that he was a painter they tried to approach
him, to show him too that they were the real thing; but he looked
at them, across the big room, as if they were miles away: they
were a compendium of everything that he most objected to in the
social system of his country.&nbsp; Such people as that, all
convention and patent-leather, with ejaculations that stopped
conversation, had no business in a studio.&nbsp; A studio was a
place to learn to see, and how could you see through a pair of
feather beds?</p>
<p>The main inconvenience I suffered at their hands was that, at
first, I was shy of letting them discover how my artful little
servant had begun to sit to me for &ldquo;Rutland
Ramsay.&rdquo;&nbsp; They knew that I had been odd enough (they
were prepared by this time to allow oddity to artists,) to pick a
foreign vagabond out of the streets, when I might have had a
person with whiskers and credentials; but it was some time before
they learned how high I rated his accomplishments.&nbsp; They
found him in an attitude more than once, but they never doubted I
was doing him as an organ-grinder.&nbsp; There were several
things they never guessed, and one of them was that for a
striking scene in the novel, in which a footman briefly figured,
it occurred to me to make use of Major Monarch as the
menial.&nbsp; I kept putting this off, I didn&rsquo;t like to ask
him to don the livery&mdash;besides the difficulty of finding a
livery to fit him.&nbsp; At last, one day late in the winter,
when I was at work on the despised Oronte (he caught one&rsquo;s
idea in an instant), and was in the glow of feeling that I was
going very straight, they came in, the Major and his wife, with
their society laugh about nothing (there was less and less to
laugh at), like country-callers&mdash;they always reminded me of
that&mdash;who have walked across the park after church and are
presently persuaded to stay to luncheon.&nbsp; Luncheon was over,
but they could stay to tea&mdash;I knew they wanted it.&nbsp; The
fit was on me, however, and I couldn&rsquo;t let my ardour cool
and my work wait, with the fading daylight, while my model
prepared it.&nbsp; So I asked Mrs. Monarch if she would mind
laying it out&mdash;a request which, for an instant, brought all
the blood to her face.&nbsp; Her eyes were on her husband&rsquo;s
for a second, and some mute telegraphy passed between them.&nbsp;
Their folly was over the next instant; his cheerful shrewdness
put an end to it.&nbsp; So far from pitying their wounded pride,
I must add, I was moved to give it as complete a lesson as I
could.&nbsp; They bustled about together and got out the cups and
saucers and made the kettle boil.&nbsp; I know they felt as if
they were waiting on my servant, and when the tea was prepared I
said: &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll have a cup, please&mdash;he&rsquo;s
tired.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mrs. Monarch brought him one where he stood,
and he took it from her as if he had been a gentleman at a party,
squeezing a crush-hat with an elbow.</p>
<p>Then it came over me that she had made a great effort for
me&mdash;made it with a kind of nobleness&mdash;and that I owed
her a compensation.&nbsp; Each time I saw her after this I
wondered what the compensation could be.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t
go on doing the wrong thing to oblige them.&nbsp; Oh, it
<i>was</i> the wrong thing, the stamp of the work for which they
sat&mdash;Hawley was not the only person to say it now.&nbsp; I
sent in a large number of the drawings I had made for
&ldquo;Rutland Ramsay,&rdquo; and I received a warning that was
more to the point than Hawley&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The artistic adviser
of the house for which I was working was of opinion that many of
my illustrations were not what had been looked for.&nbsp; Most of
these illustrations were the subjects in which the Monarchs had
figured.&nbsp; Without going into the question of what <i>had</i>
been looked for, I saw at this rate I shouldn&rsquo;t get the
other books to do.&nbsp; I hurled myself in despair upon Miss
Churm, I put her through all her paces.&nbsp; I not only adopted
Oronte publicly as my hero, but one morning when the Major looked
in to see if I didn&rsquo;t require him to finish a figure for
the <i>Cheapside</i>, for which he had begun to sit the week
before, I told him that I had changed my mind&mdash;I would do
the drawing from my man.&nbsp; At this my visitor turned pale and
stood looking at me.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is <i>he</i> your idea of an
English gentleman?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>I was disappointed, I was nervous, I wanted to get on with my
work; so I replied with irritation: &ldquo;Oh, my dear
Major&mdash;I can&rsquo;t be ruined for <i>you</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stood another moment; then, without a word, he quitted the
studio.&nbsp; I drew a long breath when he was gone, for I said
to myself that I shouldn&rsquo;t see him again.&nbsp; I had not
told him definitely that I was in danger of having my work
rejected, but I was vexed at his not having felt the catastrophe
in the air, read with me the moral of our fruitless
collaboration, the lesson that, in the deceptive atmosphere of
art, even the highest respectability may fail of being
plastic.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t owe my friends money, but I did see them
again.&nbsp; They re-appeared together, three days later, and
under the circumstances there was something tragic in the
fact.&nbsp; It was a proof to me that they could find nothing
else in life to do.&nbsp; They had threshed the matter out in a
dismal conference&mdash;they had digested the bad news that they
were not in for the series.&nbsp; If they were not useful to me
even for the <i>Cheapside</i> their function seemed difficult to
determine, and I could only judge at first that they had come,
forgivingly, decorously, to take a last leave.&nbsp; This made me
rejoice in secret that I had little leisure for a scene; for I
had placed both my other models in position together and I was
pegging away at a drawing from which I hoped to derive
glory.&nbsp; It had been suggested by the passage in which
Rutland Ramsay, drawing up a chair to Artemisia&rsquo;s
piano-stool, says extraordinary things to her while she
ostensibly fingers out a difficult piece of music.&nbsp; I had
done Miss Churm at the piano before&mdash;it was an attitude in
which she knew how to take on an absolutely poetic grace.&nbsp; I
wished the two figures to &ldquo;compose&rdquo; together,
intensely, and my little Italian had entered perfectly into my
conception.&nbsp; The pair were vividly before me, the piano had
been pulled out; it was a charming picture of blended youth and
murmured love, which I had only to catch and keep.&nbsp; My
visitors stood and looked at it, and I was friendly to them over
my shoulder.</p>
<p>They made no response, but I was used to silent company and
went on with my work, only a little disconcerted (even though
exhilarated by the sense that <i>this</i> was at least the ideal
thing), at not having got rid of them after all.&nbsp; Presently
I heard Mrs. Monarch&rsquo;s sweet voice beside, or rather above
me: &ldquo;I wish her hair was a little better done.&rdquo;&nbsp;
I looked up and she was staring with a strange fixedness at Miss
Churm, whose back was turned to her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you mind my
just touching it?&rdquo; she went on&mdash;a question which made
me spring up for an instant, as with the instinctive fear that
she might do the young lady a harm.&nbsp; But she quieted me with
a glance I shall never forget&mdash;I confess I should like to
have been able to paint <i>that</i>&mdash;and went for a moment
to my model.&nbsp; She spoke to her softly, laying a hand upon
her shoulder and bending over her; and as the girl,
understanding, gratefully assented, she disposed her rough curls,
with a few quick passes, in such a way as to make Miss
Churm&rsquo;s head twice as charming.&nbsp; It was one of the
most heroic personal services I have ever seen rendered.&nbsp;
Then Mrs. Monarch turned away with a low sigh and, looking about
her as if for something to do, stooped to the floor with a noble
humility and picked up a dirty rag that had dropped out of my
paint-box.</p>
<p>The Major meanwhile had also been looking for something to do
and, wandering to the other end of the studio, saw before him my
breakfast things, neglected, unremoved.&nbsp; &ldquo;I say,
can&rsquo;t I be useful <i>here</i>?&rdquo; he called out to me
with an irrepressible quaver.&nbsp; I assented with a laugh that
I fear was awkward and for the next ten minutes, while I worked,
I heard the light clatter of china and the tinkle of spoons and
glass.&nbsp; Mrs. Monarch assisted her husband&mdash;they washed
up my crockery, they put it away.&nbsp; They wandered off into my
little scullery, and I afterwards found that they had cleaned my
knives and that my slender stock of plate had an unprecedented
surface.&nbsp; When it came over me, the latent eloquence of what
they were doing, I confess that my drawing was blurred for a
moment&mdash;the picture swam.&nbsp; They had accepted their
failure, but they couldn&rsquo;t accept their fate.&nbsp; They
had bowed their heads in bewilderment to the perverse and cruel
law in virtue of which the real thing could be so much less
precious than the unreal; but they didn&rsquo;t want to
starve.&nbsp; If my servants were my models, my models might be
my servants.&nbsp; They would reverse the parts&mdash;the others
would sit for the ladies and gentlemen, and <i>they</i> would do
the work.&nbsp; They would still be in the studio&mdash;it was an
intense dumb appeal to me not to turn them out.&nbsp; &ldquo;Take
us on,&rdquo; they wanted to say&mdash;&ldquo;we&rsquo;ll do
<i>anything</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When all this hung before me the <i>afflatus</i>
vanished&mdash;my pencil dropped from my hand.&nbsp; My sitting
was spoiled and I got rid of my sitters, who were also evidently
rather mystified and awestruck.&nbsp; Then, alone with the Major
and his wife, I had a most uncomfortable moment, He put their
prayer into a single sentence: &ldquo;I say, you know&mdash;just
let <i>us</i> do for you, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; I
couldn&rsquo;t&mdash;it was dreadful to see them emptying my
slops; but I pretended I could, to oblige them, for about a
week.&nbsp; Then I gave them a sum of money to go away; and I
never saw them again.&nbsp; I obtained the remaining books, but
my friend Hawley repeats that Major and Mrs. Monarch did me a
permanent harm, got me into a second-rate trick.&nbsp; If it be
true I am content to have paid the price&mdash;for the
memory.</p>
<h2><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>SIR
DOMINICK FERRAND.</h2>
<h3>I.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">There</span> are several objections
to it, but I&rsquo;ll take it if you&rsquo;ll alter it,&rdquo;
Mr. Locket&rsquo;s rather curt note had said; and there was no
waste of words in the postscript in which he had added: &ldquo;If
you&rsquo;ll come in and see me, I&rsquo;ll show you what I
mean.&rdquo;&nbsp; This communication had reached Jersey Villas
by the first post, and Peter Baron had scarcely swallowed his
leathery muffin before he got into motion to obey the editorial
behest.&nbsp; He knew that such precipitation looked eager, and
he had no desire to look eager&mdash;it was not in his interest;
but how could he maintain a godlike calm, principled though he
was in favour of it, the first time one of the great magazines
had accepted, even with a cruel reservation, a specimen of his
ardent young genius?</p>
<p>It was not till, like a child with a sea-shell at his ear, he
began to be aware of the great roar of the
&ldquo;underground,&rdquo; that, in his third-class carriage, the
cruelty of the reservation penetrated, with the taste of acrid
smoke, to his inner sense.&nbsp; It was really degrading to be
eager in the face of having to &ldquo;alter.&rdquo;&nbsp; Peter
Baron tried to figure to himself at that moment that he was not
flying to betray the extremity of his need, but hurrying to fight
for some of those passages of superior boldness which were
exactly what the conductor of the &ldquo;Promiscuous
Review&rdquo; would be sure to be down upon.&nbsp; He made
believe&mdash;as if to the greasy fellow-passenger
opposite&mdash;that he felt indignant; but he saw that to the
small round eye of this still more downtrodden brother he
represented selfish success.&nbsp; He would have liked to linger
in the conception that he had been &ldquo;approached&rdquo; by
the Promiscuous; but whatever might be thought in the office of
that periodical of some of his flights of fancy, there was no
want of vividness in his occasional suspicion that he passed
there for a familiar bore.&nbsp; The only thing that was clearly
flattering was the fact that the Promiscuous rarely published
fiction.&nbsp; He should therefore be associated with a deviation
from a solemn habit, and that would more than make up to him for
a phrase in one of Mr. Locket&rsquo;s inexorable earlier notes, a
phrase which still rankled, about his showing no symptom of the
faculty really creative.&nbsp; &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem able
to keep a character together,&rdquo; this pitiless monitor had
somewhere else remarked.&nbsp; Peter Baron, as he sat in his
corner while the train stopped, considered, in the befogged
gaslight, the bookstall standard of literature and asked himself
whose character had fallen to pieces now.&nbsp; Tormenting indeed
had always seemed to him such a fate as to have the creative head
without the creative hand.</p>
<p>It should be mentioned, however, that before he started on his
mission to Mr. Locket his attention had been briefly engaged by
an incident occurring at Jersey Villas.&nbsp; On leaving the
house (he lived at No.&nbsp; 3, the door of which stood open to a
small front garden), he encountered the lady who, a week before,
had taken possession of the rooms on the ground floor, the
&ldquo;parlours&rdquo; of Mrs. Bundy&rsquo;s terminology.&nbsp;
He had heard her, and from his window, two or three times, had
even seen her pass in and out, and this observation had created
in his mind a vague prejudice in her favour.&nbsp; Such a
prejudice, it was true, had been subjected to a violent test; it
had been fairly apparent that she had a light step, but it was
still less to be overlooked that she had a cottage piano.&nbsp;
She had furthermore a little boy and a very sweet voice, of which
Peter Baron had caught the accent, not from her singing (for she
only played), but from her gay admonitions to her child, whom she
occasionally allowed to amuse himself&mdash;under restrictions
very publicly enforced&mdash;in the tiny black patch which, as a
forecourt to each house, was held, in the humble row, to be a
feature.&nbsp; Jersey Villas stood in pairs, semi-detached, and
Mrs. Ryves&mdash;such was the name under which the new lodger
presented herself&mdash;had been admitted to the house as
confessedly musical.&nbsp; Mrs. Bundy, the earnest proprietress
of No. 3, who considered her &ldquo;parlours&rdquo; (they were a
dozen feet square), even more attractive, if possible, than the
second floor with which Baron had had to content
himself&mdash;Mrs. Bundy, who reserved the drawing-room for a
casual dressmaking business, had threshed out the subject of the
new lodger in advance with our young man, reminding him that her
affection for his own person was a proof that, other things being
equal, she positively preferred tenants who were clever.</p>
<p>This was the case with Mrs. Ryves; she had satisfied Mrs.
Bundy that she was not a simple strummer.&nbsp; Mrs. Bundy
admitted to Peter Baron that, for herself, she had a weakness for
a pretty tune, and Peter could honestly reply that his ear was
equally sensitive.&nbsp; Everything would depend on the
&ldquo;touch&rdquo; of their inmate.&nbsp; Mrs. Ryves&rsquo;s
piano would blight his existence if her hand should prove heavy
or her selections vulgar; but if she played agreeable things and
played them in an agreeable way she would render him rather a
service while he smoked the pipe of &ldquo;form.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Mrs. Bundy, who wanted to let her rooms, guaranteed on the part
of the stranger a first-class talent, and Mrs. Ryves, who
evidently knew thoroughly what she was about, had not falsified
this somewhat rash prediction.&nbsp; She never played in the
morning, which was Baron&rsquo;s working-time, and he found
himself listening with pleasure at other hours to her discreet
and melancholy strains.&nbsp; He really knew little about music,
and the only criticism he would have made of Mrs. Ryves&rsquo;s
conception of it was that she seemed devoted to the dismal.&nbsp;
It was not, however, that these strains were not pleasant to him;
they floated up, on the contrary, as a sort of conscious response
to some of his broodings and doubts.&nbsp; Harmony, therefore,
would have reigned supreme had it not been for the singularly bad
taste of No. 4.&nbsp; Mrs. Ryves&rsquo;s piano was on the free
side of the house and was regarded by Mrs. Bundy as open to no
objection but that of their own gentleman, who was so
reasonable.&nbsp; As much, however, could not be said of the
gentleman of No. 4, who had not even Mr. Baron&rsquo;s excuse of
being &ldquo;littery&rdquo; (he kept a bull-terrier and had five
hats&mdash;the street could count them), and whom, if you had
listened to Mrs. Bundy, you would have supposed to be divided
from the obnoxious instrument by walls and corridors, obstacles
and intervals, of massive structure and fabulous extent.&nbsp;
This gentleman had taken up an attitude which had now passed into
the phase of correspondence and compromise; but it was the
opinion of the immediate neighbourhood that he had not a leg to
stand upon, and on whatever subject the sentiment of Jersey
Villas might have been vague, it was not so on the rights and the
wrongs of landladies.</p>
<p>Mrs. Ryves&rsquo;s little boy was in the garden as Peter Baron
issued from the house, and his mother appeared to have come out
for a moment, bareheaded, to see that he was doing no harm.&nbsp;
She was discussing with him the responsibility that he might
incur by passing a piece of string round one of the iron palings
and pretending he was in command of a &ldquo;geegee&rdquo;; but
it happened that at the sight of the other lodger the child was
seized with a finer perception of the drivable.&nbsp; He rushed
at Baron with a flourish of the bridle, shouting, &ldquo;Ou
geegee!&rdquo; in a manner productive of some refined
embarrassment to his mother.&nbsp; Baron met his advance by
mounting him on a shoulder and feigning to prance an instant, so
that by the time this performance was over&mdash;it took but a
few seconds&mdash;the young man felt introduced to Mrs.
Ryves.&nbsp; Her smile struck him as charming, and such an
impression shortens many steps.&nbsp; She said, &ldquo;Oh, thank
you&mdash;you mustn&rsquo;t let him worry you&rdquo;; and then
as, having put down the child and raised his hat, he was turning
away, she added: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very good of you not to
complain of my piano.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I particularly enjoy it&mdash;you play
beautifully,&rdquo; said Peter Baron.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have to play, you see&mdash;it&rsquo;s all I can
do.&nbsp; But the people next door don&rsquo;t like it, though my
room, you know, is not against their wall.&nbsp; Therefore I
thank you for letting me tell them that you, in the house,
don&rsquo;t find me a nuisance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked gentle and bright as she spoke, and as the young
man&rsquo;s eyes rested on her the tolerance for which she
expressed herself indebted seemed to him the least indulgence she
might count upon.&nbsp; But he only laughed and said &ldquo;Oh,
no, you&rsquo;re not a nuisance!&rdquo; and felt more and more
introduced.</p>
<p>The little boy, who was handsome, hereupon clamoured for
another ride, and she took him up herself, to moderate his
transports.&nbsp; She stood a moment with the child in her arms,
and he put his fingers exuberantly into her hair, so that while
she smiled at Baron she slowly, permittingly shook her head to
get rid of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they really make a fuss I&rsquo;m afraid I shall
have to go,&rdquo; she went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t go!&rdquo; Baron broke out, with a
sudden expressiveness which made his voice, as it fell upon his
ear, strike him as the voice of another.&nbsp; She gave a vague
exclamation and, nodding slightly but not unsociably, passed back
into the house.&nbsp; She had made an impression which remained
till the other party to the conversation reached the
railway-station, when it was superseded by the thought of his
prospective discussion with Mr. Locket.&nbsp; This was a proof of
the intensity of that interest.</p>
<p>The aftertaste of the later conference was also intense for
Peter Baron, who quitted his editor with his manuscript under his
arm.&nbsp; He had had the question out with Mr. Locket, and he
was in a flutter which ought to have been a sense of triumph and
which indeed at first he succeeded in regarding in this
light.&nbsp; Mr. Locket had had to admit that there was an idea
in his story, and that was a tribute which Baron was in a
position to make the most of.&nbsp; But there was also a scene
which scandalised the editorial conscience and which the young
man had promised to rewrite.&nbsp; The idea that Mr. Locket had
been so good as to disengage depended for clearness mainly on
this scene; so it was easy to see his objection was
perverse.&nbsp; This inference was probably a part of the joy in
which Peter Baron walked as he carried home a contribution it
pleased him to classify as accepted.&nbsp; He walked to work off
his excitement and to think in what manner he should
reconstruct.&nbsp; He went some distance without settling that
point, and then, as it began to worry him, he looked vaguely into
shop-windows for solutions and hints.&nbsp; Mr. Locket lived in
the depths of Chelsea, in a little panelled, amiable house, and
Baron took his way homeward along the King&rsquo;s Road.&nbsp;
There was a new amusement for him, a fresher bustle, in a London
walk in the morning; these were hours that he habitually spent at
his table, in the awkward attitude engendered by the poor piece
of furniture, one of the rickety features of Mrs. Bundy&rsquo;s
second floor, which had to serve as his altar of literary
sacrifice.&nbsp; If by exception he went out when the day was
young he noticed that life seemed younger with it; there were
livelier industries to profit by and shop-girls, often rosy, to
look at; a different air was in the streets and a chaff of
traffic for the observer of manners to catch.&nbsp; Above all, it
was the time when poor Baron made his purchases, which were
wholly of the wandering mind; his extravagances, for some
mysterious reason, were all matutinal, and he had a foreknowledge
that if ever he should ruin himself it would be well before
noon.&nbsp; He felt lavish this morning, on the strength of what
the Promiscuous would do for him; he had lost sight for the
moment of what he should have to do for the Promiscuous.&nbsp;
Before the old bookshops and printshops, the crowded panes of the
curiosity-mongers and the desirable exhibitions of mahogany
&ldquo;done up,&rdquo; he used, by an innocent process, to commit
luxurious follies.&nbsp; He refurnished Mrs. Bundy with a freedom
that cost her nothing, and lost himself in pictures of a
transfigured second floor.</p>
<p>On this particular occasion the King&rsquo;s Road proved
almost unprecedentedly expensive, and indeed this occasion
differed from most others in containing the germ of real
danger.&nbsp; For once in a way he had a bad conscience&mdash;he
felt himself tempted to pick his own pocket.&nbsp; He never saw a
commodious writing-table, with elbow-room and drawers and a fair
expanse of leather stamped neatly at the edge with gilt, without
being freshly reminded of Mrs. Bundy&rsquo;s dilapidations.&nbsp;
There were several such tables in the King&rsquo;s
Road&mdash;they seemed indeed particularly numerous today.&nbsp;
Peter Baron glanced at them all through the fronts of the shops,
but there was one that detained him in supreme
contemplation.&nbsp; There was a fine assurance about it which
seemed a guarantee of masterpieces; but when at last he went in
and, just to help himself on his way, asked the impossible price,
the sum mentioned by the voluble vendor mocked at him even more
than he had feared.&nbsp; It was far too expensive, as he hinted,
and he was on the point of completing his comedy by a pensive
retreat when the shopman bespoke his attention for another
article of the same general character, which he described as
remarkably cheap for what it was.&nbsp; It was an old piece, from
a sale in the country, and it had been in stock some time; but it
had got pushed out of sight in one of the upper rooms&mdash;they
contained such a wilderness of treasures&mdash;and happened to
have but just come to light.&nbsp; Peter suffered himself to be
conducted into an interminable dusky rear, where he presently
found himself bending over one of those square substantial desks
of old mahogany, raised, with the aid of front legs, on a sort of
retreating pedestal which is fitted with small drawers,
contracted conveniences known immemorially to the knowing as
davenports.&nbsp; This specimen had visibly seen service, but it
had an old-time solidity and to Peter Baron it unexpectedly
appealed.</p>
<p>He would have said in advance that such an article was exactly
what he didn&rsquo;t want, but as the shopman pushed up a chair
for him and he sat down with his elbows on the gentle slope of
the large, firm lid, he felt that such a basis for literature
would be half the battle.&nbsp; He raised the lid and looked
lovingly into the deep interior; he sat ominously silent while
his companion dropped the striking words: &ldquo;Now that&rsquo;s
an article I personally covet!&rdquo;&nbsp; Then when the man
mentioned the ridiculous price (they were literally giving it
away), he reflected on the economy of having a literary altar on
which one could really kindle a fire.&nbsp; A davenport was a
compromise, but what was all life but a compromise?&nbsp; He
could beat down the dealer, and at Mrs. Bundy&rsquo;s he had to
write on an insincere card-table.&nbsp; After he had sat for a
minute with his nose in the friendly desk he had a queer
impression that it might tell him a secret or two&mdash;one of
the secrets of form, one of the sacrificial
mysteries&mdash;though no doubt its career had been literary only
in the sense of its helping some old lady to write invitations to
dull dinners.&nbsp; There was a strange, faint odour in the
receptacle, as if fragrant, hallowed things had once been put
away there.&nbsp; When he took his head out of it he said to the
shopman: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind meeting you
halfway.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had been told by knowing people that
that was the right thing.&nbsp; He felt rather vulgar, but the
davenport arrived that evening at Jersey Villas.</p>
<h3>II.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;I <span class="smcap">daresay</span> it will be all
right; he seems quiet now,&rdquo; said the poor lady of the
&ldquo;parlours&rdquo; a few days later, in reference to their
litigious neighbour and the precarious piano.&nbsp; The two
lodgers had grown regularly acquainted, and the piano had had
much to do with it.&nbsp; Just as this instrument served, with
the gentleman at No. 4, as a theme for discussion, so between
Peter Baron and the lady of the parlours it had become a basis of
peculiar agreement, a topic, at any rate, of conversation
frequently renewed.&nbsp; Mrs. Ryves was so prepossessing that
Peter was sure that even if they had not had the piano he would
have found something else to thresh out with her.&nbsp;
Fortunately however they did have it, and he, at least, made the
most of it, knowing more now about his new friend, who when,
widowed and fatigued, she held her beautiful child in her arms,
looked dimly like a modern Madonna.&nbsp; Mrs. Bundy, as a letter
of furnished lodgings, was characterised in general by a familiar
domestic severity in respect to picturesque young women, but she
had the highest confidence in Mrs. Ryves.&nbsp; She was luminous
about her being a lady, and a lady who could bring Mrs. Bundy
back to a gratified recognition of one of those manifestations of
mind for which she had an independent esteem.&nbsp; She was
professional, but Jersey Villas could be proud of a profession
that didn&rsquo;t happen to be the wrong one&mdash;they had seen
something of that.&nbsp; Mrs. Ryves had a hundred a year (Baron
wondered how Mrs. Bundy knew this; he thought it unlikely Mrs.
Ryves had told her), and for the rest she depended on her lovely
music.&nbsp; Baron judged that her music, even though lovely, was
a frail dependence; it would hardly help to fill a concert-room,
and he asked himself at first whether she played country-dances
at children&rsquo;s parties or gave lessons to young ladies who
studied above their station.</p>
<p>Very soon, indeed, he was sufficiently enlightened; it all
went fast, for the little boy had been almost as great a help as
the piano.&nbsp; Sidney haunted the doorstep of No.&nbsp; 3 he
was eminently sociable, and had established independent relations
with Peter, a frequent feature of which was an adventurous visit,
upstairs, to picture books criticised for not being <i>all</i>
geegees and walking sticks happily more conformable.&nbsp; The
young man&rsquo;s window, too, looked out on their acquaintance;
through a starched muslin curtain it kept his neighbour before
him, made him almost more aware of her comings and goings than he
felt he had a right to be.&nbsp; He was capable of a shyness of
curiosity about her and of dumb little delicacies of
consideration.&nbsp; She did give a few lessons; they were
essentially local, and he ended by knowing more or less what she
went out for and what she came in from.&nbsp; She had almost no
visitors, only a decent old lady or two, and, every day, poor
dingy Miss Teagle, who was also ancient and who came humbly
enough to governess the infant of the parlours.&nbsp; Peter
Baron&rsquo;s window had always, to his sense, looked out on a
good deal of life, and one of the things it had most shown him
was that there is nobody so bereft of joy as not to be able to
command for twopence the services of somebody less joyous.&nbsp;
Mrs. Ryves was a struggler (Baron scarcely liked to think of it),
but she occupied a pinnacle for Miss Teagle, who had lived
on&mdash;and from a noble nursery&mdash;into a period of diplomas
and humiliation.</p>
<p>Mrs. Ryves sometimes went out, like Baron himself, with
manuscripts under her arm, and, still more like Baron, she almost
always came back with them.&nbsp; Her vain approaches were to the
music-sellers; she tried to compose&mdash;to produce songs that
would make a hit.&nbsp; A successful song was an income, she
confided to Peter one of the first times he took Sidney,
blas&eacute; and drowsy, back to his mother.&nbsp; It was not on
one of these occasions, but once when he had come in on no better
pretext than that of simply wanting to (she had after all
virtually invited him), that she mentioned how only one song in a
thousand was successful and that the terrible difficulty was in
getting the right words.&nbsp; This rightness was just a vulgar
&ldquo;fluke&rdquo;&mdash;there were lots of words really clever
that were of no use at all.&nbsp; Peter said, laughing, that he
supposed any words he should try to produce would be sure to be
too clever; yet only three weeks after his first encounter with
Mrs. Ryves he sat at his delightful davenport (well aware that he
had duties more pressing), trying to string together rhymes
idiotic enough to make his neighbour&rsquo;s fortune.&nbsp; He
was satisfied of the fineness of her musical gift&mdash;it had
the touching note.&nbsp; The touching note was in her person as
well.</p>
<p>The davenport was delightful, after six months of its
tottering predecessor, and such a re-enforcement to the young
man&rsquo;s style was not impaired by his sense of something
lawless in the way it had been gained.&nbsp; He had made the
purchase in anticipation of the money he expected from Mr.
Locket, but Mr. Locket&rsquo;s liberality was to depend on the
ingenuity of his contributor, who now found himself confronted
with the consequence of a frivolous optimism.&nbsp; The fruit of
his labour presented, as he stared at it with his elbows on his
desk, an aspect uncompromising and incorruptible.&nbsp; It seemed
to look up at him reproachfully and to say, with its essential
finish: &ldquo;How could you promise anything so base; how could
you pass your word to mutilate and dishonour me?&rdquo;&nbsp; The
alterations demanded by Mr. Locket were impossible; the
concessions to the platitude of his conception of the public mind
were degrading.&nbsp; The public mind!&mdash;as if the public
<i>had</i> a mind, or any principle of perception more
discoverable than the stare of huddled sheep!&nbsp; Peter Baron
felt that it concerned him to determine if he were only not
clever enough or if he were simply not abject enough to rewrite
his story.&nbsp; He might in truth have had less pride if he had
had more skill, and more discretion if he had had more
practice.&nbsp; Humility, in the profession of letters, was half
of practice, and resignation was half of success.&nbsp; Poor
Peter actually flushed with pain as he recognised that this was
not success, the production of gelid prose which his editor could
do nothing with on the one side and he himself could do nothing
with on the other.&nbsp; The truth about his luckless tale was
now the more bitter from his having managed, for some days, to
taste it as sweet.</p>
<p>As he sat there, baffled and sombre, biting his pen and
wondering what was meant by the &ldquo;rewards&rdquo; of
literature, he generally ended by tossing away the composition
deflowered by Mr. Locket and trying his hand at the sort of
twaddle that Mrs. Ryves might be able to set to music.&nbsp;
Success in these experiments wouldn&rsquo;t be a reward of
literature, but it might very well become a labour of love.&nbsp;
The experiments would be pleasant enough for him if they were
pleasant for his inscrutable neighbour.&nbsp; That was the way he
thought of her now, for he had learned enough about her, little
by little, to guess how much there was still to learn.&nbsp; To
spend his mornings over cheap rhymes for her was certainly to
shirk the immediate question; but there were hours when he judged
this question to be altogether too arduous, reflecting that he
might quite as well perish by the sword as by famine.&nbsp;
Besides, he did meet it obliquely when he considered that he
shouldn&rsquo;t be an utter failure if he were to produce some
songs to which Mrs. Ryves&rsquo;s accompaniments would give a
circulation.&nbsp; He had not ventured to show her anything yet,
but one morning, at a moment when her little boy was in his room,
it seemed to him that, by an inspiration, he had arrived at the
happy middle course (it was an art by itself), between sound and
sense.&nbsp; If the sense was not confused it was because the
sound was so familiar.</p>
<p>He had said to the child, to whom he had sacrificed
barley-sugar (it had no attraction for his own lips, yet in these
days there was always some of it about), he had confided to the
small Sidney that if he would wait a little he should be
intrusted with something nice to take down to his parent.&nbsp;
Sidney had absorbing occupation and, while Peter copied off the
song in a pretty hand, roamed, gurgling and sticky, about the
room.&nbsp; In this manner he lurched like a little toper into
the rear of the davenport, which stood a few steps out from the
recess of the window, and, as he was fond of beating time to his
intensest joys, began to bang on the surface of it with a
paper-knife which at that spot had chanced to fall upon the
floor.&nbsp; At the moment Sidney committed this violence his
kind friend had happened to raise the lid of the desk and, with
his head beneath it, was rummaging among a mass of papers for a
proper envelope.&nbsp; &ldquo;I say, I say, my boy!&rdquo; he
exclaimed, solicitous for the ancient glaze of his most cherished
possession.&nbsp; Sidney paused an instant; then, while Peter
still hunted for the envelope, he administered another, and this
time a distinctly disobedient, rap.&nbsp; Peter heard it from
within and was struck with its oddity of sound&mdash;so much so
that, leaving the child for a moment under a demoralising
impression of impunity, he waited with quick curiosity for a
repetition of the stroke.&nbsp; It came of course immediately,
and then the young man, who had at the same instant found his
envelope and ejaculated &ldquo;Hallo, this thing has a false
back!&rdquo; jumped up and secured his visitor, whom with his
left arm he held in durance on his knee while with his free hand
he addressed the missive to Mrs. Ryves.</p>
<p>As Sidney was fond of errands he was easily got rid of, and
after he had gone Baron stood a moment at the window chinking
pennies and keys in pockets and wondering if the charming
composer would think his song as good, or in other words as bad,
as he thought it.&nbsp; His eyes as he turned away fell on the
wooden back of the davenport, where, to his regret, the traces of
Sidney&rsquo;s assault were visible in three or four ugly
scratches.&nbsp; &ldquo;Confound the little brute!&rdquo; he
exclaimed, feeling as if an altar had been desecrated.&nbsp; He
was reminded, however, of the observation this outrage had led
him to make, and, for further assurance, he knocked on the wood
with his knuckle.&nbsp; It sounded from that position commonplace
enough, but his suspicion was strongly confirmed when, again
standing beside the desk, he put his head beneath the lifted lid
and gave ear while with an extended arm he tapped sharply in the
same place.&nbsp; The back was distinctly hollow; there was a
space between the inner and the outer pieces (he could measure
it), so wide that he was a fool not to have noticed it
before.&nbsp; The depth of the receptacle from front to rear was
so great that it could sacrifice a certain quantity of room
without detection.&nbsp; The sacrifice could of course only be
for a purpose, and the purpose could only be the creation of a
secret compartment.&nbsp; Peter Baron was still boy enough to be
thrilled by the idea of such a feature, the more so as every
indication of it had been cleverly concealed.&nbsp; The people at
the shop had never noticed it, else they would have called his
attention to it as an enhancement of value.&nbsp; His legendary
lore instructed him that where there was a hiding-place there was
always a hidden spring, and he pried and pressed and fumbled in
an eager search for the sensitive spot.&nbsp; The article was
really a wonder of neat construction; everything fitted with a
closeness that completely saved appearances.</p>
<p>It took Baron some minutes to pursue his inquiry, during which
he reflected that the people of the shop were not such fools
after all.&nbsp; They had admitted moreover that they had
accidentally neglected this relic of gentility&mdash;it had been
overlooked in the multiplicity of their treasures.&nbsp; He now
recalled that the man had wanted to polish it up before sending
it home, and that, satisfied for his own part with its honourable
appearance and averse in general to shiny furniture, he had in
his impatience declined to wait for such an operation, so that
the object had left the place for Jersey Villas, carrying
presumably its secret with it, two or three hours after his
visit.&nbsp; This secret it seemed indeed capable of keeping;
there was an absurdity in being baffled, but Peter couldn&rsquo;t
find the spring.&nbsp; He thumped and sounded, he listened and
measured again; he inspected every joint and crevice, with the
effect of becoming surer still of the existence of a chamber and
of making up his mind that his davenport was a rarity.&nbsp; Not
only was there a compartment between the two backs, but there was
distinctly something <i>in</i> the compartment!&nbsp; Perhaps it
was a lost manuscript&mdash;a nice, safe, old-fashioned story
that Mr. Locket wouldn&rsquo;t object to.&nbsp; Peter returned to
the charge, for it had occurred to him that he had perhaps not
sufficiently visited the small drawers, of which, in two vertical
rows, there were six in number, of different sizes, inserted
sideways into that portion of the structure which formed part of
the support of the desk.&nbsp; He took them out again and
examined more minutely the condition of their sockets, with the
happy result of discovering at last, in the place into which the
third on the left-hand row was fitted, a small sliding
panel.&nbsp; Behind the panel was a spring, like a flat button,
which yielded with a click when he pressed it and which instantly
produced a loosening of one of the pieces of the shelf forming
the highest part of the davenport&mdash;pieces adjusted to each
other with the most deceptive closeness.</p>
<p>This particular piece proved to be, in its turn, a sliding
panel, which, when pushed, revealed the existence of a smaller
receptacle, a narrow, oblong box, in the false back.&nbsp; Its
capacity was limited, but if it couldn&rsquo;t hold many things
it might hold precious ones.&nbsp; Baron, in presence of the
ingenuity with which it had been dissimulated, immediately felt
that, but for the odd chance of little Sidney Ryves&rsquo;s
having hammered on the outside at the moment he himself happened
to have his head in the desk, he might have remained for years
without suspicion of it.&nbsp; This apparently would have been a
loss, for he had been right in guessing that the chamber was not
empty.&nbsp; It contained objects which, whether precious or not,
had at any rate been worth somebody&rsquo;s hiding.&nbsp; These
objects were a collection of small flat parcels, of the shape of
packets of letters, wrapped in white paper and neatly
sealed.&nbsp; The seals, mechanically figured, bore the impress
neither of arms nor of initials; the paper looked old&mdash;it
had turned faintly sallow; the packets might have been there for
ages.&nbsp; Baron counted them&mdash;there were nine in all, of
different sizes; he turned them over and over, felt them
curiously and snuffed in their vague, musty smell, which affected
him with the melancholy of some smothered human accent.&nbsp; The
little bundles were neither named nor numbered&mdash;there was
not a word of writing on any of the covers; but they plainly
contained old letters, sorted and matched according to dates or
to authorship.&nbsp; They told some old, dead story&mdash;they
were the ashes of fires burned out.</p>
<p>As Peter Baron held his discoveries successively in his hands
he became conscious of a queer emotion which was not altogether
elation and yet was still less pure pain.&nbsp; He had made a
find, but it somehow added to his responsibility; he was in the
presence of something interesting, but (in a manner he
couldn&rsquo;t have defined) this circumstance suddenly
constituted a danger.&nbsp; It was the perception of the danger,
for instance, which caused to remain in abeyance any impulse he
might have felt to break one of the seals.&nbsp; He looked at
them all narrowly, but he was careful not to loosen them, and he
wondered uncomfortably whether the contents of the secret
compartment would be held in equity to be the property of the
people in the King&rsquo;s Road.&nbsp; He had given money for the
davenport, but had he given money for these buried papers?&nbsp;
He paid by a growing consciousness that a nameless chill had
stolen into the air the penalty, which he had many a time paid
before, of being made of sensitive stuff.&nbsp; It was as if an
occasion had insidiously arisen for a sacrifice&mdash;a sacrifice
for the sake of a fine superstition, something like honour or
kindness or justice, something indeed perhaps even finer
still&mdash;a difficult deciphering of duty, an impossible
tantalising wisdom.&nbsp; Standing there before his ambiguous
treasure and losing himself for the moment in the sense of a
dawning complication, he was startled by a light, quick tap at
the door of his sitting-room.&nbsp; Instinctively, before
answering, he listened an instant&mdash;he was in the attitude of
a miser surprised while counting his hoard.&nbsp; Then he
answered &ldquo;One moment, please!&rdquo; and slipped the little
heap of packets into the biggest of the drawers of the davenport,
which happened to be open.&nbsp; The aperture of the false back
was still gaping, and he had not time to work back the
spring.&nbsp; He hastily laid a big book over the place and then
went and opened his door.</p>
<p>It offered him a sight none the less agreeable for being
unexpected&mdash;the graceful and agitated figure of Mrs.
Ryves.&nbsp; Her agitation was so visible that he thought at
first that something dreadful had happened to her
child&mdash;that she had rushed up to ask for help, to beg him to
go for the doctor.&nbsp; Then he perceived that it was probably
connected with the desperate verses he had transmitted to her a
quarter of an hour before; for she had his open manuscript in one
hand and was nervously pulling it about with the other.&nbsp; She
looked frightened and pretty, and if, in invading the privacy of
a fellow-lodger, she had been guilty of a departure from rigid
custom, she was at least conscious of the enormity of the step
and incapable of treating it with levity.&nbsp; The levity was
for Peter Baron, who endeavoured, however, to clothe his
familiarity with respect, pushing forward the seat of honour and
repeating that he rejoiced in such a visit.&nbsp; The visitor
came in, leaving the door ajar, and after a minute during which,
to help her, he charged her with the purpose of telling him that
he ought to be ashamed to send her down such rubbish, she
recovered herself sufficiently to stammer out that his song was
exactly what she had been looking for and that after reading it
she had been seized with an extraordinary, irresistible
impulse&mdash;that of thanking him for it in person and without
delay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the impulse of a kind nature,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;and I can&rsquo;t tell you what pleasure you give
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She declined to sit down, and evidently wished to appear to
have come but for a few seconds.&nbsp; She looked confusedly at
the place in which she found herself, and when her eyes met his
own they struck him as anxious and appealing.&nbsp; She was
evidently not thinking of his song, though she said three or four
times over that it was beautiful.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, I only
wanted you to know, and now I must go,&rdquo; she added; but on
his hearthrug she lingered with such an odd helplessness that he
felt almost sorry for her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I can improve it if you find it doesn&rsquo;t
go,&rdquo; said Baron.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so delighted to do
anything for you I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There may be a word or two that might be
changed,&rdquo; she answered, rather absently.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
shall have to think it over, to live with it a little.&nbsp; But
I like it, and that&rsquo;s all I wanted to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charming of you.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not a bit busy,&rdquo;
said Baron.</p>
<p>Again she looked at him with a troubled intensity, then
suddenly she demanded: &ldquo;Is there anything the matter with
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The matter with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean like being ill or worried.&nbsp; I wondered if
there might be; I had a sudden fancy; and that, I think, is
really why I came up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t, indeed; I&rsquo;m all right.&nbsp;
But your sudden fancies are inspirations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s absurd.&nbsp; You must excuse me.&nbsp;
Good-by!&rdquo; said Mrs. Ryves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are the words you want changed?&rdquo; Baron
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want any&mdash;if you&rsquo;re all
right.&nbsp; Good-by,&rdquo; his visitor repeated, fixing her
eyes an instant on an object on his desk that had caught
them.&nbsp; His own glanced in the same direction and he saw that
in his hurry to shuffle away the packets found in the davenport
he had overlooked one of them, which lay with its seals
exposed.&nbsp; For an instant he felt found out, as if he had
been concerned in something to be ashamed of, and it was only his
quick second thought that told him how little the incident of
which the packet was a sequel was an affair of Mrs.
Ryves&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Her conscious eyes came back to his as if
they were sounding them, and suddenly this instinct of keeping
his discovery to himself was succeeded by a really startled
inference that, with the rarest alertness, she had guessed
something and that her guess (it seemed almost supernatural), had
been her real motive.&nbsp; Some secret sympathy had made her
vibrate&mdash;had touched her with the knowledge that he had
brought something to light.&nbsp; After an instant he saw that
she also divined the very reflection he was then making, and this
gave him a lively desire, a grateful, happy desire, to appear to
have nothing to conceal.&nbsp; For herself, it determined her
still more to put an end to her momentary visit.&nbsp; But before
she had passed to the door he exclaimed: &ldquo;All right?&nbsp;
How can a fellow be anything else who has just had such a
find?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused at this, still looking earnest and asking:
&ldquo;What have you found?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some ancient family papers, in a secret compartment of
my writing-table.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he took up the packet he had
left out, holding it before her eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;A lot of other
things like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are they?&rdquo; murmured Mrs. Ryves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the least idea.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re
sealed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t broken the seals?&rdquo; She had come
further back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t had time; it only happened ten minutes
ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew it,&rdquo; said Mrs. Ryves, more gaily now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That you were in some predicament.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re extraordinary.&nbsp; I never heard of
anything so miraculous; down two flights of stairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Are</i> you in a quandary?&rdquo; the visitor
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, about giving them back.&rdquo;&nbsp; Peter Baron
stood smiling at her and rapping his packet on the palm of his
hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;What do you advise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She herself smiled now, with her eyes on the sealed
parcel.&nbsp; &ldquo;Back to whom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man of whom I bought the table.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah then, they&rsquo;re not from <i>your</i>
family?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No indeed, the piece of furniture in which they were
hidden is not an ancestral possession.&nbsp; I bought it at
second hand&mdash;you see it&rsquo;s old&mdash;the other day in
the King&rsquo;s Road.&nbsp; Obviously the man who sold it to me
sold me more than he meant; he had no idea (from his own point of
view it was stupid of him), that there was a hidden chamber or
that mysterious documents were buried there.&nbsp; Ought I to go
and tell him?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s rather a nice question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are the papers of value?&rdquo; Mrs. Ryves
inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the least idea.&nbsp; But I can
ascertain by breaking a seal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; said Mrs. Ryves, with much
expression.&nbsp; She looked grave again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather tantalising&mdash;it&rsquo;s a bit of
a problem,&rdquo; Baron went on, turning his packet over.</p>
<p>Mrs. Ryves hesitated.&nbsp; &ldquo;Will you show me what you
have in your hand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gave her the packet, and she looked at it and held it for
an instant to her nose.&nbsp; &ldquo;It has a queer, charming old
fragrance,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charming?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s horrid.&rdquo;&nbsp; She
handed him back the packet, saying again more emphatically
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t break a seal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t give back the papers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it honest to keep them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re yours as much as the
people&rsquo;s of the shop.&nbsp; They were in the hidden chamber
when the table came to the shop, and the people had every
opportunity to find them out.&nbsp; They
didn&rsquo;t&mdash;therefore let them take the
consequences.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter Baron reflected, diverted by her intensity.&nbsp; She
was pale, with eyes almost ardent.&nbsp; &ldquo;The table had
been in the place for years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That proves the things haven&rsquo;t been
missed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me show you how they were concealed,&rdquo; he
rejoined; and he exhibited the ingenious recess and the working
of the curious spring.&nbsp; She was greatly interested, she grew
excited and became familiar; she appealed to him again not to do
anything so foolish as to give up the papers, the rest of which,
in their little blank, impenetrable covers, he placed in a row
before her.&nbsp; &ldquo;They might be traced&mdash;their
history, their ownership,&rdquo; he argued; to which she replied
that this was exactly why he ought to be quiet.&nbsp; He declared
that women had not the smallest sense of honour, and she retorted
that at any rate they have other perceptions more delicate than
those of men.&nbsp; He admitted that the papers might be rubbish,
and she conceded that nothing was more probable; yet when he
offered to settle the point off-hand she caught him by the wrist,
acknowledging that, absurd as it was, she was nervous.&nbsp;
Finally she put the whole thing on the ground of his just doing
her a favour.&nbsp; She asked him to retain the papers, to be
silent about them, simply because it would please her.&nbsp; That
would be reason enough.&nbsp; Baron&rsquo;s acquaintance, his
agreeable relations with her, advanced many steps in the
treatment of this question; an element of friendly candour made
its way into their discussion of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make out why it matters to you, one way
or the other, nor why you should think it worth talking
about,&rdquo; the young man reasoned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither can I.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s just a whim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, if it will give you any pleasure, I&rsquo;ll
say nothing at the shop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s charming of you, and I&rsquo;m very
grateful.&nbsp; I see now that this was why the spirit moved me
to come up&mdash;to save them,&rdquo; Mrs. Ryves went on.&nbsp;
She added, moving away, that now she had saved them she must
really go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To save them for what, if I mayn&rsquo;t break the
seals?&rdquo; Baron asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;for a generous
sacrifice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should it be generous?&nbsp; What&rsquo;s at
stake?&rdquo; Peter demanded, leaning against the doorpost as she
stood on the landing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what, but I feel as if something or
other were in peril.&nbsp; Burn them up!&rdquo; she exclaimed
with shining eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, you ask too much&mdash;I&rsquo;m so curious about
them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I won&rsquo;t ask more than I ought, and
I&rsquo;m much obliged to you for your promise to be quiet.&nbsp;
I trust to your discretion.&nbsp; Good-by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to <i>reward</i> my discretion,&rdquo; said
Baron, coming out to the landing.</p>
<p>She had partly descended the staircase and she stopped,
leaning against the baluster and smiling up at him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Surely you&rsquo;ve had your reward in the honour of my
visit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s delightful as far as it goes.&nbsp; But
what will you do for me if I burn the papers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Ryves considered a moment.&nbsp; &ldquo;Burn them first
and you&rsquo;ll see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>On this she went rapidly downstairs, and Baron, to whom the
answer appeared inadequate and the proposition indeed in that
form grossly unfair, returned to his room.&nbsp; The vivacity of
her interest in a question in which she had discoverably nothing
at stake mystified, amused and, in addition, irresistibly charmed
him.&nbsp; She was delicate, imaginative, inflammable, quick to
feel, quick to act.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t complain of it, it was
the way he liked women to be; but he was not impelled for the
hour to commit the sealed packets to the flames.&nbsp; He dropped
them again into their secret well, and after that he went
out.&nbsp; He felt restless and excited; another day was lost for
work&mdash;the dreadful job to be performed for Mr. Locket was
still further off.</p>
<h3>III.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Ten</span> days after Mrs. Ryves&rsquo;s
visit he paid by appointment another call on the editor of the
Promiscuous.&nbsp; He found him in the little wainscoted Chelsea
house, which had to Peter&rsquo;s sense the smoky brownness of an
old pipebowl, surrounded with all the emblems of his
office&mdash;a litter of papers, a hedge of encyclop&aelig;dias,
a photographic gallery of popular contributors&mdash;and he
promised at first to consume very few of the moments for which so
many claims competed.&nbsp; It was Mr. Locket himself however who
presently made the interview spacious, gave it air after
discovering that poor Baron had come to tell him something more
interesting than that he couldn&rsquo;t after all patch up his
tale.&nbsp; Peter had begun with this, had intimated respectfully
that it was a case in which both practice and principle rebelled,
and then, perceiving how little Mr. Locket was affected by his
audacity, had felt weak and slightly silly, left with his heroism
on his hands.&nbsp; He had armed himself for a struggle, but the
Promiscuous didn&rsquo;t even protest, and there would have been
nothing for him but to go away with the prospect of never coming
again had he not chanced to say abruptly, irrelevantly, as he got
up from his chair:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you happen to be at all interested in Sir Dominick
Ferrand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Locket, who had also got up, looked over his
glasses.&nbsp; &ldquo;The late Sir Dominick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only one; you know the family&rsquo;s
extinct.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Locket shot his young friend another sharp glance, a
silent retort to the glibness of this information.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Very extinct indeed.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m afraid the subject
today would scarcely be regarded as attractive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you very sure?&rdquo; Baron asked.</p>
<p>Mr. Locket leaned forward a little, with his fingertips on his
table, in the attitude of giving permission to retire.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I might consider the question in a special
connection.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was silent a minute, in a way that
relegated poor Peter to the general; but meeting the young
man&rsquo;s eyes again he asked: &ldquo;Are
you&mdash;a&mdash;thinking of proposing an article upon
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly proposing it&mdash;because I don&rsquo;t
yet quite see my way; but the idea rather appeals to
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Locket emitted the safe assertion that this eminent
statesman had been a striking figure in his day; then he added:
&ldquo;Have you been studying him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been dipping into him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid he&rsquo;s scarcely a question of the
hour,&rdquo; said Mr. Locket, shuffling papers together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I could make him one,&rdquo; Peter Baron
declared.</p>
<p>Mr. Locket stared again; he was unable to repress an
unattenuated &ldquo;You?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have some new material,&rdquo; said the young man,
colouring a little.&nbsp; &ldquo;That often freshens up an old
story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It buries it sometimes.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s often only
another tombstone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That depends upon what it is.&nbsp; However,&rdquo;
Peter added, &ldquo;the documents I speak of would be a crushing
monument.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Locket, hesitating, shot another glance under his
glasses.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you allude
to&mdash;a&mdash;revelations?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very curious ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Locket, still on his feet, had kept his body at the bowing
angle; it was therefore easy for him after an instant to bend a
little further and to sink into his chair with a movement of his
hand toward the seat Baron had occupied.&nbsp; Baron resumed
possession of this convenience, and the conversation took a fresh
start on a basis which such an extension of privilege could
render but little less humiliating to our young man.&nbsp; He had
matured no plan of confiding his secret to Mr. Locket, and he had
really come out to make him conscientiously that other
announcement as to which it appeared that so much artistic
agitation had been wasted.&nbsp; He had indeed during the past
days&mdash;days of painful indecision&mdash;appealed in
imagination to the editor of the Promiscuous, as he had appealed
to other sources of comfort; but his scruples turned their face
upon him from quarters high as well as low, and if on the one
hand he had by no means made up his mind not to mention his
strange knowledge, he had still more left to the determination of
the moment the question of how he should introduce the
subject.&nbsp; He was in fact too nervous to decide; he only felt
that he needed for his peace of mind to communicate his
discovery.&nbsp; He wanted an opinion, the impression of somebody
else, and even in this intensely professional presence, five
minutes after he had begun to tell his queer story, he felt
relieved of half his burden.&nbsp; His story was very queer; he
could take the measure of that himself as he spoke; but
wouldn&rsquo;t this very circumstance qualify it for the
Promiscuous?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course the letters may be forgeries,&rdquo; said Mr.
Locket at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no doubt that&rsquo;s what many people will
say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have they been seen by any expert?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No indeed; they&rsquo;ve been seen by
nobody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you got any of them with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I felt nervous about bringing them out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a pity.&nbsp; I should have liked the
testimony of my eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may have it if you&rsquo;ll come to my rooms.&nbsp;
If you don&rsquo;t care to do that without a further guarantee
I&rsquo;ll copy you out some passages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Select a few of the worst!&rdquo; Mr. Locket
laughed.&nbsp; Over Baron&rsquo;s distressing information he had
become quite human and genial.&nbsp; But he added in a moment
more dryly: &ldquo;You know they ought to be seen by an
expert.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly what I dread,&rdquo; said
Peter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be worth nothing to me if they&rsquo;re
not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter communed with his innermost spirit.&nbsp; &ldquo;How
much will they be worth to <i>me</i> if they
<i>are</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Locket turned in his study-chair.&nbsp; &ldquo;I should
require to look at them before answering that
question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been to the British museum&mdash;there are
many of his letters there.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve obtained permission
to see them, and I&rsquo;ve compared everything carefully.&nbsp;
I repudiate the possibility of forgery.&nbsp; No sign of
genuineness is wanting; there are details, down to the very
postmarks, that no forger could have invented.&nbsp; Besides,
whose interest could it conceivably have been?&nbsp; A labor of
unspeakable difficulty, and all for what advantage?&nbsp; There
are so many letters, too&mdash;twenty-seven in all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord, what an ass!&rdquo; Mr. Locket exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be one of the strangest post-mortem revelations
of which history preserves the record.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Locket, grave now, worried with a paper-knife the crevice
of a drawer.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very odd.&nbsp; But to be
worth anything such documents should be subjected to a searching
criticism&mdash;I mean of the historical kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly; that would be the task of the writer
introducing them to the public.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again Mr. Locket considered; then with a smile he looked
up.&nbsp; &ldquo;You had better give up original composition and
take to buying old furniture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean because it will pay better?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For you, I should think, original composition
couldn&rsquo;t pay worse.&nbsp; The creative faculty&rsquo;s so
rare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do feel tempted to turn my attention to real
heroes,&rdquo; Peter replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m bound to declare that Sir Dominick Ferrand
was never one of mine.&nbsp; Flashy, crafty,
second-rate&mdash;that&rsquo;s how I&rsquo;ve always read
him.&nbsp; It was never a secret, moreover, that his private life
had its weak spots.&nbsp; He was a mere flash in the
pan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He speaks to the people of this country,&rdquo; said
Baron.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did; but his voice&mdash;the voice, I mean, of his
prestige&mdash;is scarcely audible now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re still proud of some of the things he did
at the Foreign Office&mdash;the famous &lsquo;exchange&rsquo;
with Spain, in the Mediterranean, which took Europe so by
surprise and by which she felt injured, especially when it became
apparent how much we had the best of the bargain.&nbsp; Then the
sudden, unexpected show of force by which he imposed on the
United States our interpretation of that tiresome treaty&mdash;I
could never make out what it was about.&nbsp; These were both
matters that no one really cared a straw about, but he made every
one feel as if they cared; the nation rose to the way he played
his trumps&mdash;it was uncommon.&nbsp; He was one of the few men
we&rsquo;ve had, in our period, who took Europe, or took America,
by surprise, made them jump a bit; and the country liked his
doing it&mdash;it was a pleasant change.&nbsp; The rest of the
world considered that they knew in any case exactly what we would
do, which was usually nothing at all.&nbsp; Say what you like,
he&rsquo;s still a high name; partly also, no doubt, on account
of other things his early success and early death, his political
&lsquo;cheek&rsquo; and wit; his very appearance&mdash;he
certainly was handsome&mdash;and the possibilities (of future
personal supremacy) which it was the fashion at the time, which
it&rsquo;s the fashion still, to say had passed away with
him.&nbsp; He had been twice at the Foreign Office; that alone
was remarkable for a man dying at forty-four.&nbsp; What
therefore will the country think when it learns he was
venal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter Baron himself was not angry with Sir Dominick Ferrand,
who had simply become to him (he had been &ldquo;reading
up&rdquo; feverishly for a week) a very curious subject of
psychological study; but he could easily put himself in the place
of that portion of the public whose memory was long enough for
their patriotism to receive a shock.&nbsp; It was some time
fortunately since the conduct of public affairs had wanted for
men of disinterested ability, but the extraordinary documents
concealed (of all places in the world&mdash;it was as fantastic
as a nightmare) in a &ldquo;bargain&rdquo; picked up at
second-hand by an obscure scribbler, would be a calculable blow
to the retrospective mind.&nbsp; Baron saw vividly that if these
relics should be made public the scandal, the horror, the chatter
would be immense.&nbsp; Immense would be also the contribution to
truth, the rectification of history.&nbsp; He had felt for
several days (and it was exactly what had made him so nervous) as
if he held in his hand the key to public attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are too many things to explain,&rdquo; Mr. Locket
went on, &ldquo;and the singular <i>provenance</i> of your papers
would count almost overwhelmingly against them even if the other
objections were met.&nbsp; There would be a perfect and probably
a very complicated pedigree to trace.&nbsp; How did they get into
your davenport, as you call it, and how long had they been
there?&nbsp; What hands secreted them? what hands had, so
incredibly, clung to them and preserved them?&nbsp; Who are the
persons mentioned in them? who are the correspondents, the
parties to the nefarious transactions?&nbsp; You say the
transactions appear to be of two distinct kinds&mdash;some of
them connected with public business and others involving obscure
personal relations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They all have this in common,&rdquo; said Peter Baron,
&ldquo;that they constitute evidence of uneasiness, in some
instances of painful alarm, on the writer&rsquo;s part, in
relation to exposure&mdash;the exposure in the one case, as I
gather, of the fact that he had availed himself of official
opportunities to promote enterprises (public works and that sort
of thing) in which he had a pecuniary stake.&nbsp; The dread of
the light in the other connection is evidently different, and
these letters are the earliest in date.&nbsp; They are addressed
to a woman, from whom he had evidently received money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Locket wiped his glasses.&nbsp; &ldquo;What
woman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the least idea.&nbsp; There are lots of
questions I can&rsquo;t answer, of course; lots of identities I
can&rsquo;t establish; lots of gaps I can&rsquo;t fill.&nbsp; But
as to two points I&rsquo;m clear, and they are the essential
ones.&nbsp; In the first place the papers in my possession are
genuine; in the second place they&rsquo;re
compromising.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this Peter Baron rose again, rather vexed with himself
for having been led on to advertise his treasure (it was his
interlocutor&rsquo;s perfectly natural scepticism that produced
this effect), for he felt that he was putting himself in a false
position.&nbsp; He detected in Mr. Locket&rsquo;s studied
detachment the fermentation of impulses from which, unsuccessful
as he was, he himself prayed to be delivered.</p>
<p>Mr. Locket remained seated; he watched Baron go across the
room for his hat and umbrella.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of course, the
question would come up of whose property today such documents
would legally he.&nbsp; There are heirs, descendants, executors
to consider.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In some degree perhaps; but I&rsquo;ve gone into that a
little.&nbsp; Sir Dominick Ferrand had no children, and he left
no brothers and no sisters.&nbsp; His wife survived him, but she
died ten years ago.&nbsp; He can have had no heirs and no
executors to speak of, for he left no property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s to his honour and against your
theory,&rdquo; said Mr. Locket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>have</i> no theory.&nbsp; He left a largeish mass
of debt,&rdquo; Peter Baron added.&nbsp; At this Mr. Locket got
up, while his visitor pursued: &ldquo;So far as I can ascertain,
though of course my inquiries have had to be very rapid and
superficial, there is no one now living, directly or indirectly
related to the personage in question, who would be likely to
suffer from any steps in the direction of publicity.&nbsp; It
happens to be a rare instance of a life that had, as it were, no
loose ends.&nbsp; At least there are none perceptible at
present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see, I see,&rdquo; said Mr. Locket.&nbsp; &ldquo;But
I don&rsquo;t think I should care much for your
article.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What article?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The one you seem to wish to write, embodying this new
matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t wish to write it!&rdquo; Peter
exclaimed.&nbsp; And then he bade his host good-by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-by,&rdquo; said Mr. Locket.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mind you,
I don&rsquo;t say that I think there&rsquo;s nothing in
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would think there was something in it if you were
to see my documents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to see the secret compartment,&rdquo; the
caustic editor rejoined.&nbsp; &ldquo;Copy me out some
extracts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To what end, if there&rsquo;s no question of their
being of use to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say that&mdash;I might like the letters
themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Themselves?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not as the basis of a paper, but just to
publish&mdash;for a sensation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;d sell your number!&rdquo; Baron
laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I daresay I should like to look at them,&rdquo; Mr.
Locket conceded after a moment.&nbsp; &ldquo;When should I find
you at home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t come,&rdquo; said the young man.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I make you no offer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might make <i>you</i> one,&rdquo; the editor
hinted.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t trouble yourself; I shall
probably destroy them.&rdquo;&nbsp; With this Peter Baron took
his departure, waiting however just afterwards, in the street
near the house, as if he had been looking out for a stray hansom,
to which he would not have signalled had it appeared.&nbsp; He
thought Mr. Locket might hurry after him, but Mr. Locket seemed
to have other things to do, and Peter Baron returned on foot to
Jersey Villas.</p>
<h3>IV.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the evening that succeeded this
apparently pointless encounter he had an interview more
conclusive with Mrs. Bundy, for whose shrewd and philosophic view
of life he had several times expressed, even to the good woman
herself, a considerable relish.&nbsp; The situation at Jersey
Villas (Mrs. Ryves had suddenly flown off to Dover) was such as
to create in him a desire for moral support, and there was a kind
of domestic determination in Mrs. Bundy which seemed, in general,
to advertise it.&nbsp; He had asked for her on coming in, but had
been told she was absent for the hour; upon which he had
addressed himself mechanically to the task of doing up his
dishonoured manuscript&mdash;the ingenious fiction about which
Mr. Locket had been so stupid&mdash;for further adventures and
not improbable defeats.&nbsp; He passed a restless, ineffective
afternoon, asking himself if his genius were a horrid delusion,
looking out of his window for something that didn&rsquo;t happen,
something that seemed now to be the advent of a persuasive Mr.
Locket and now the return, from an absence more disappointing
even than Mrs. Bundy&rsquo;s, of his interesting neighbour of the
parlours.&nbsp; He was so nervous and so depressed that he was
unable even to fix his mind on the composition of the note with
which, on its next peregrination, it was necessary that his
manuscript should be accompanied.&nbsp; He was too nervous to
eat, and he forgot even to dine; he forgot to light his candles,
he let his fire go out, and it was in the melancholy chill of the
late dusk that Mrs. Bundy, arriving at last with his lamp, found
him extended moodily upon his sofa.&nbsp; She had been informed
that he wished to speak to her, and as she placed on the
malodorous luminary an oily shade of green pasteboard she
expressed the friendly hope that there was nothing wrong with his
&rsquo;ealth.</p>
<p>The young man rose from his couch, pulling himself together
sufficiently to reply that his health was well enough but that
his spirits were down in his hoots.&nbsp; He had a strong
disposition to &ldquo;draw&rdquo; his landlady on the subject of
Mrs. Ryves, as well as a vivid conviction that she constituted a
theme as to which Mrs. Bundy would require little pressure to
tell him even more than she knew.&nbsp; At the same time he hated
to appear to pry into the secrets of his absent friend; to
discuss her with their bustling hostess resembled too much for
his taste a gossip with a tattling servant about an unconscious
employer.&nbsp; He left out of account however Mrs. Bundy&rsquo;s
knowledge of the human heart, for it was this fine principle that
broke down the barriers after he had reflected reassuringly that
it was not meddling with Mrs. Ryves&rsquo;s affairs to try and
find out if she struck such an observer as happy.&nbsp; Crudely,
abruptly, even a little blushingly, he put the direct question to
Mrs. Bundy, and this led tolerably straight to another question,
which, on his spirit, sat equally heavy (they were indeed but
different phases of the same), and which the good woman answered
with expression when she ejaculated: &ldquo;Think it a liberty
for you to run down for a few hours?&nbsp; If she do, my dear
sir, just send her to me to talk to!&rdquo;&nbsp; As regards
happiness indeed she warned Baron against imposing too high a
standard on a young thing who had been through so much, and
before he knew it he found himself, without the responsibility of
choice, in submissive receipt of Mrs. Bundy&rsquo;s version of
this experience.&nbsp; It was an interesting picture, though it
had its infirmities, one of them congenital and consisting of the
fact that it had sprung essentially from the virginal brain of
Miss Teagle.&nbsp; Amplified, edited, embellished by the richer
genius of Mrs. Bundy, who had incorporated with it and now
liberally introduced copious interleavings of Miss Teagle&rsquo;s
own romance, it gave Peter Baron much food for meditation, at the
same time that it only half relieved his curiosity about the
causes of the charming woman&rsquo;s underlying
strangeness.&nbsp; He sounded this note experimentally in Mrs.
Bundy&rsquo;s ear, but it was easy to see that it didn&rsquo;t
reverberate in her fancy.&nbsp; She had no idea of the picture it
would have been natural for him to desire that Mrs. Ryves should
present to him, and she was therefore unable to estimate the
points in respect to which his actual impression was
irritating.&nbsp; She had indeed no adequate conception of the
intellectual requirements of a young man in love.&nbsp; She
couldn&rsquo;t tell him why their faultless friend was so
isolated, so unrelated, so nervously, shrinkingly proud.&nbsp; On
the other hand she could tell him (he knew it already) that she
had passed many years of her life in the acquisition of
accomplishments at a seat of learning no less remote than
Boulogne, and that Miss Teagle had been intimately acquainted
with the late Mr. Everard Ryves, who was a &ldquo;most
rising&rdquo; young man in the city, not making any year less
than his clear twelve hundred.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now that he
isn&rsquo;t there to make them, his mourning widow can&rsquo;t
live as she had then, can she?&rdquo; Mrs. Bundy asked.</p>
<p>Baron was not prepared to say that she could, but he thought
of another way she might live as he sat, the next day, in the
train which rattled him down to Dover.&nbsp; The place, as he
approached it, seemed bright and breezy to him; his roamings had
been neither far enough nor frequent enough to make the
cockneyfied coast insipid.&nbsp; Mrs. Bundy had of course given
him the address he needed, and on emerging from the station he
was on the point of asking what direction he should take.&nbsp;
His attention however at this moment was drawn away by the bustle
of the departing boat.&nbsp; He had been long enough shut up in
London to be conscious of refreshment in the mere act of turning
his face to Paris.&nbsp; He wandered off to the pier in company
with happier tourists and, leaning on a rail, watched enviously
the preparation, the agitation of foreign travel.&nbsp; It was
for some minutes a foretaste of adventure; but, ah, when was he
to have the very draught?&nbsp; He turned away as he dropped this
interrogative sigh, and in doing so perceived that in another
part of the pier two ladies and a little boy were gathered with
something of the same wistfulness.&nbsp; The little boy indeed
happened to look round for a moment, upon which, with the
keenness of the predatory age, he recognised in our young man a
source of pleasures from which he lately had been weaned.&nbsp;
He bounded forward with irrepressible cries of
&ldquo;Geegee!&rdquo; and Peter lifted him aloft for an
embrace.&nbsp; On putting him down the pilgrim from Jersey Villas
stood confronted with a sensibly severe Miss Teagle, who had
followed her little charge.&nbsp; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter
with the old woman?&rdquo; he asked himself as he offered her a
hand which she treated as the merest detail.&nbsp; Whatever it
was, it was (and very properly, on the part of a loyal
<i>suivante</i>) the same complaint as that of her employer, to
whom, from a distance, for Mrs. Ryves had not advanced an inch,
he flourished his hat as she stood looking at him with a face
that he imagined rather white.&nbsp; Mrs. Ryves&rsquo;s response
to this salutation was to shift her position in such a manner as
to appear again absorbed in the Calais boat.&nbsp; Peter Baron,
however, kept hold of the child, whom Miss Teagle artfully
endeavoured to wrest from him&mdash;a policy in which he was
aided by Sidney&rsquo;s own rough but instinctive loyalty; and he
was thankful for the happy effect of being dragged by his
jubilant friend in the very direction in which he had tended for
so many hours.&nbsp; Mrs. Ryves turned once more as he came near,
and then, from the sweet, strained smile with which she asked him
if he were on his way to France, he saw that if she had been
angry at his having followed her she had quickly got over it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not crossing; but it came over me that
you might be, and that&rsquo;s why I hurried down&mdash;to catch
you before you were off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we can&rsquo;t go&mdash;more&rsquo;s the pity; but
why, if we could,&rdquo; Mrs. Ryves inquired, &ldquo;should you
wish to prevent it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I&rsquo;ve something to ask you first,
something that may take some time.&rdquo;&nbsp; He saw now that
her embarrassment had really not been resentful; it had been
nervous, tremulous, as the emotion of an unexpected pleasure
might have been.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s really why I
determined last night, without asking your leave first to pay you
this little visit&mdash;that and the intense desire for another
bout of horse-play with Sidney.&nbsp; Oh, I&rsquo;ve come to see
you,&rdquo; Peter Baron went on, &ldquo;and I won&rsquo;t make
any secret of the fact that I expect you to resign yourself
gracefully to the trial and give me all your time.&nbsp; The
day&rsquo;s lovely, and I&rsquo;m ready to declare that the place
is as good as the day.&nbsp; Let me drink deep of these things,
drain the cup like a man who hasn&rsquo;t been out of London for
months and months.&nbsp; Let me walk with you and talk with you
and lunch with you&mdash;I go back this afternoon.&nbsp; Give me
all your hours in short, so that they may live in my memory as
one of the sweetest occasions of life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The emission of steam from the French packet made such an
uproar that Baron could breathe his passion into the young
woman&rsquo;s ear without scandalising the spectators; and the
charm which little by little it scattered over his fleeting visit
proved indeed to be the collective influence of the conditions he
had put into words.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is it you wish to ask
me?&rdquo; Mrs. Ryves demanded, as they stood there together; to
which he replied that he would tell her all about it if she would
send Miss Teagle off with Sidney.&nbsp; Miss Teagle, who was
always anticipating her cue, had already begun ostentatiously to
gaze at the distant shores of France and was easily enough
induced to take an earlier start home and rise to the
responsibility of stopping on her way to contend with the
butcher.&nbsp; She had however to retire without Sidney, who
clung to his recovered prey, so that the rest of the episode was
seasoned, to Baron&rsquo;s sense, by the importunate twitch of
the child&rsquo;s little, plump, cool hand.&nbsp; The friends
wandered together with a conjugal air and Sidney not between
them, hanging wistfully, first, over the lengthened picture of
the Calais boat, till they could look after it, as it moved
rumbling away, in a spell of silence which seemed to
confess&mdash;especially when, a moment later, their eyes
met&mdash;that it produced the same fond fancy in each.&nbsp; The
presence of the boy moreover was no hindrance to their talking in
a manner that they made believe was very frank.&nbsp; Peter Baron
presently told his companion what it was he had taken a journey
to ask, and he had time afterwards to get over his discomfiture
at her appearance of having fancied it might be something
greater.&nbsp; She seemed disappointed (but she was forgiving) on
learning from him that he had only wished to know if she judged
ferociously his not having complied with her request to respect
certain seals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How ferociously do you suspect me of having judged
it?&rdquo; she inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, to the extent of leaving the house the next
moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were still lingering on the great granite pier when he
touched on this matter, and she sat down at the end while the
breeze, warmed by the sunshine, ruffled the purple sea.&nbsp; She
coloured a little and looked troubled, and after an instant she
repeated interrogatively: &ldquo;The next moment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As soon as I told you what I had done.&nbsp; I was
scrupulous about this, you will remember; I went straight
downstairs to confess to you.&nbsp; You turned away from me,
saying nothing; I couldn&rsquo;t imagine&mdash;as I vow I
can&rsquo;t imagine now&mdash;why such a matter should appear so
closely to touch you.&nbsp; I went out on some business and when
I returned you had quitted the house.&nbsp; It had all the look
of my having offended you, of your wishing to get away from
me.&nbsp; You didn&rsquo;t even give me time to tell you how it
was that, in spite of your advice, I determined to see for myself
what my discovery represented.&nbsp; You must do me justice and
hear what determined me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Ryves got up from her scat and asked him, as a particular
favour, not to allude again to his discovery.&nbsp; It was no
concern of hers at all, and she had no warrant for prying into
his secrets.&nbsp; She was very sorry to have been for a moment
so absurd as to appear to do so, and she humbly begged his pardon
for her meddling.&nbsp; Saying this she walked on with a charming
colour in her cheek, while he laughed out, though he was really
bewildered, at the endless capriciousness of women.&nbsp;
Fortunately the incident didn&rsquo;t spoil the hour, in which
there were other sources of satisfaction, and they took their
course to her lodgings with such pleasant little pauses and
excursions by the way as permitted her to show him the objects of
interest at Dover.&nbsp; She let him stop at a
wine-merchant&rsquo;s and buy a bottle for luncheon, of which, in
its order, they partook, together with a pudding invented by Miss
Teagle, which, as they hypocritically swallowed it, made them
look at each other in an intimacy of indulgence.&nbsp; They came
out again and, while Sidney grubbed in the gravel of the shore,
sat selfishly on the Parade, to the disappointment of Miss
Teagle, who had fixed her hopes on a fly and a ladylike visit to
the castle.&nbsp; Baron had his eye on his watch&mdash;he had to
think of his train and the dismal return and many other
melancholy things; but the sea in the afternoon light was a more
appealing picture; the wind had gone down, the Channel was
crowded, the sails of the ships were white in the purple
distance.&nbsp; The young man had asked his companion (he had
asked her before) when she was to come back to Jersey Villas, and
she had said that she should probably stay at Dover another
week.&nbsp; It was dreadfully expensive, but it was doing the
child all the good in the world, and if Miss Teagle could go up
for some things she should probably be able to manage an
extension.&nbsp; Earlier in the day she had said that she perhaps
wouldn&rsquo;t return to Jersey Villas at all, or only return to
wind up her connection with Mrs. Bundy.&nbsp; At another moment
she had spoken of an early date, an immediate reoccupation of the
wonderful parlours.&nbsp; Baron saw that she had no plan, no real
reasons, that she was vague and, in secret, worried and nervous,
waiting for something that didn&rsquo;t depend on herself.&nbsp;
A silence of several minutes had fallen upon them while they
watched the shining sails; to which Mrs. Ryves put an end by
exclaiming abruptly, but without completing her sentence:
&ldquo;Oh, if you had come to tell me you had destroyed
them&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those terrible papers?&nbsp; I like the way you talk
about &lsquo;destroying!&rsquo;&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t even know
what they are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to know; they put me into a
state.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sort of a state?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; they haunt me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They haunted me; that was why, early one morning,
suddenly, I couldn&rsquo;t keep my hands off them.&nbsp; I had
told you I wouldn&rsquo;t touch them.&nbsp; I had deferred to
your whim, your superstition (what is it?) but at last they got
the better of me.&nbsp; I had lain awake all night threshing
about, itching with curiosity.&nbsp; It made me ill; my own
nerves (as I may say) were irritated, my capacity to work was
gone.&nbsp; It had come over me in the small hours in the shape
of an obsession, a fixed idea, that there was nothing in the
ridiculous relics and that my exaggerated scruples were making a
fool of me.&nbsp; It was ten to one they were rubbish, they were
vain, they were empty; that they had been even a practical joke
on the part of some weak-minded gentleman of leisure, the former
possessor of the confounded davenport.&nbsp; The longer I hovered
about them with such precautions the longer I was taken in, and
the sooner I exposed their insignificance the sooner I should get
back to my usual occupations.&nbsp; This conviction made my hand
so uncontrollable that that morning before breakfast I broke one
of the seals.&nbsp; It took me but a few minutes to perceive that
the contents were not rubbish; the little bundle contained old
letters&mdash;very curious old letters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know&mdash;I know; &lsquo;private and
confidential.&rsquo;&nbsp; So you broke the other
seals?&rdquo;&nbsp; Mrs. Ryves looked at him with the strange
apprehension he had seen in her eyes when she appeared at his
door the moment after his discovery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, of course, because I told you an hour later,
though you would let me tell you very little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Baron, as he met this queer gaze, smiled hard at her to
prevent her guessing that he smarted with the fine reproach
conveyed in the tone of her last words; but she appeared able to
guess everything, for she reminded him that she had not had to
wait that morning till he came downstairs to know what had
happened above, but had shown him at the moment how she had been
conscious of it an hour before, had passed on her side the same
tormented night as he, and had had to exert extraordinary
self-command not to rush up to his rooms while the study of the
open packets was going on.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re so
sensitively organised and you&rsquo;ve such mysterious powers
that you re uncanny,&rdquo; Baron declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel what takes place at a distance; that&rsquo;s
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One would think somebody you liked was in
danger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you that that was what was present to me the day
I came up to see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but you don&rsquo;t like me so much as that,&rdquo;
Baron argued, laughing.</p>
<p>She hesitated.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t know that I
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be for someone else&mdash;the other person
concerned.&nbsp; The other day, however, you wouldn&rsquo;t let
me tell you that person&rsquo;s name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Ryves, at this, rose quickly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
want to know it; it&rsquo;s none of my business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, fortunately, I don&rsquo;t think it is,&rdquo;
Baron rejoined, walking with her along the Parade.&nbsp; She had
Sidney by the hand now, and the young man was on the other side
of her.&nbsp; They moved toward the station&mdash;she had offered
to go part of the way.&nbsp; &ldquo;But with your miraculous gift
it&rsquo;s a wonder you haven&rsquo;t divined.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only divine what I want,&rdquo; said Mrs. Ryves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very convenient!&rdquo; exclaimed Peter,
to whom Sidney had presently come round again.&nbsp; &ldquo;Only,
being thus in the dark, it&rsquo;s difficult to see your motive
for wishing the papers destroyed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Ryves meditated, looking fixedly at the ground.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I thought you might do it to oblige me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does it strike you that such an expectation, formed in
such conditions, is reasonable?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Ryves stopped short, and this time she turned on him the
clouded clearness of her eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;What do you mean to
do with them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Peter Baron&rsquo;s turn to meditate, which he did, on
the empty asphalt of the Parade (the &ldquo;season,&rdquo; at
Dover, was not yet), where their shadows were long in the
afternoon light.&nbsp; He was under such a charm as he had never
known, and he wanted immensely to be able to reply:
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do anything you like if you&rsquo;ll love
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; These words, however, would have represented a
responsibility and have constituted what was vulgarly termed an
offer.&nbsp; An offer of what? he quickly asked himself here, as
he had already asked himself after making in spirit other awkward
dashes in the same direction&mdash;of what but his poverty, his
obscurity, his attempts that had come to nothing, his abilities
for which there was nothing to show?&nbsp; Mrs. Ryves was not
exactly a success, but she was a greater success than Peter
Baron.&nbsp; Poor as he was he hated the sordid (he knew she
didn&rsquo;t love it), and he felt small for talking of
marriage.&nbsp; Therefore he didn&rsquo;t put the question in the
words it would have pleased him most to hear himself utter, but
he compromised, with an angry young pang, and said to her:
&ldquo;What will you do for me if I put an end to
them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shook her head sadly&mdash;it was always her prettiest
movement.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can promise nothing&mdash;oh, no, I
can&rsquo;t promise!&nbsp; We must part now,&rdquo; she
added.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll miss your train.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at his watch, taking the hand she held out to
him.&nbsp; She drew it away quickly, and nothing then was left
him, before hurrying to the station, but to catch up Sidney and
squeeze him till he uttered a little shriek.&nbsp; On the way
back to town the situation struck him as grotesque.</p>
<h3>V.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> tormented him so the next
morning that after threshing it out a little further he felt he
had something of a grievance.&nbsp; Mrs. Ryves&rsquo;s
intervention had made him acutely uncomfortable, for she had
taken the attitude of exerting pressure without, it appeared,
recognising on his part an equal right.&nbsp; She had imposed
herself as an influence, yet she held herself aloof as a
participant; there were things she looked to him to do for her,
yet she could tell him of no good that would come to him from the
doing.&nbsp; She should either have had less to say or have been
willing to say more, and he asked himself why he should be the
sport of her moods and her mysteries.&nbsp; He perceived her
knack of punctual interference to be striking, but it was just
this apparent infallibility that he resented.&nbsp; Why
didn&rsquo;t she set up at once as a professional clairvoyant and
eke out her little income more successfully?&nbsp; In purely
private life such a gift was disconcerting; her divinations, her
evasions disturbed at any rate his own tranquillity.</p>
<p>What disturbed it still further was that he received early in
the day a visit from Mr. Locket, who, leaving him under no
illusion as to the grounds of such an honour, remarked as soon as
he had got into the room or rather while he still panted on the
second flight and the smudged little slavey held open
Baron&rsquo;s door, that he had taken up his young friend&rsquo;s
invitation to look at Sir Dominick Ferrand&rsquo;s letters for
himself.&nbsp; Peter drew them forth with a promptitude intended
to show that he recognised the commercial character of the call
and without attenuating the inconsequence of this departure from
the last determination he had expressed to Mr. Locket.&nbsp; He
showed his visitor the davenport and the hidden recess, and he
smoked a cigarette, humming softly, with a sense of unwonted
advantage and triumph, while the cautious editor sat silent and
handled the papers.&nbsp; For all his caution Mr. Locket was
unable to keep a warmer light out of his judicial eye as he said
to Baron at last with sociable brevity&mdash;a tone that took
many things for granted: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take them home with
me&mdash;they require much attention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man looked at him a moment.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you
think they&rsquo;re genuine?&rdquo;&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t mean to
be mocking, he meant not to be; but the words sounded so to his
own ear, and he could see that they produced that effect on Mr.
Locket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t in the least determine.&nbsp; I shall
have to go into them at my leisure, and that&rsquo;s why I ask
you to lend them to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had shuffled the papers together with a movement charged,
while he spoke, with the air of being preliminary to that of
thrusting them into a little black bag which he had brought with
him and which, resting on the shelf of the davenport, struck
Peter, who viewed it askance, as an object darkly
editorial.&nbsp; It made our young man, somehow, suddenly
apprehensive; the advantage of which he had just been conscious
was about to be transferred by a quiet process of legerdemain to
a person who already had advantages enough.&nbsp; Baron, in
short, felt a deep pang of anxiety; he couldn&rsquo;t have said
why.&nbsp; Mr. Locket took decidedly too many things for granted,
and the explorer of Sir Dominick Ferrand&rsquo;s irregularities
remembered afresh how clear he had been after all about his
indisposition to traffic in them.&nbsp; He asked his visitor to
what end he wished to remove the letters, since on the one hand
there was no question now of the article in the Promiscuous which
was to reveal their existence, and on the other he himself, as
their owner, had a thousand insurmountable scruples about putting
them into circulation.</p>
<p>Mr. Locket looked over his spectacles as over the battlements
of a fortress.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not thinking of the
end&mdash;I&rsquo;m thinking of the beginning.&nbsp; A few
glances have assured me that such documents ought to be submitted
to some competent eye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you mustn&rsquo;t show them to anyone!&rdquo; Baron
exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may think me presumptuous, but the eye that I
venture to allude to in those terms&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the eye now fixed so terribly on <i>me</i>?&rdquo;
Peter laughingly interrupted.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, it would be
interesting, I confess, to know how they strike a man of your
acuteness!&rdquo;&nbsp; It had occurred to him that by such a
concession he might endear himself to a literary umpire hitherto
implacable.&nbsp; There would be no question of his publishing
Sir Dominick Ferrand, but he might, in due acknowledgment of
services rendered, form the habit of publishing Peter
Baron.&nbsp; &ldquo;How long would it be your idea to retain
them?&rdquo; he inquired, in a manner which, he immediately
became aware, was what incited Mr. Locket to begin stuffing the
papers into his bag.&nbsp; With this perception he came quickly
closer and, laying his hand on the gaping receptacle, lightly
drew its two lips together.&nbsp; In this way the two men stood
for a few seconds, touching, almost in the attitude of combat,
looking hard into each other&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>The tension was quickly relieved however by the surprised
flush which mantled on Mr. Locket&rsquo;s brow.&nbsp; He fell
back a few steps with an injured dignity that might have been a
protest against physical violence.&nbsp; &ldquo;Really, my dear
young sir, your attitude is tantamount to an accusation of
intended bad faith.&nbsp; Do you think I want to steal the
confounded things?&rdquo;&nbsp; In reply to such a challenge
Peter could only hastily declare that he was guilty of no
discourteous suspicion&mdash;he only wanted a limit named, a
pledge of every precaution against accident.&nbsp; Mr. Locket
admitted the justice of the demand, assured him he would restore
the property within three days, and completed, with Peter&rsquo;s
assistance, his little arrangements for removing it
discreetly.&nbsp; When he was ready, his treacherous reticule
distended with its treasures, he gave a lingering look at the
inscrutable davenport.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s how they ever got
into that thing that puzzles one&rsquo;s brain!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was some concatenation of circumstances that
would doubtless seem natural enough if it were explained, but
that one would have to remount the stream of time to
ascertain.&nbsp; To one course I have definitely made up my mind:
not to make any statement or any inquiry at the shop.&nbsp; I
simply accept the mystery,&rdquo; said Peter, rather grandly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be thought a cheap escape if you were to put
it into a story,&rdquo; Mr. Locket smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I shouldn&rsquo;t offer the story to
<i>you</i>.&nbsp; I shall be impatient till I see my papers
again,&rdquo; the young man called out, as his visitor hurried
downstairs.</p>
<p>That evening, by the last delivery, he received, under the
Dover postmark, a letter that was not from Miss Teagle.&nbsp; It
was a slightly confused but altogether friendly note, written
that morning after breakfast, the ostensible purpose of which was
to thank him for the amiability of his visit, to express regret
at any appearance the writer might have had of meddling with what
didn&rsquo;t concern her, and to let him know that the evening
before, after he had left her, she had in a moment of inspiration
got hold of the tail of a really musical idea&mdash;a perfect
accompaniment for the song he had so kindly given her.&nbsp; She
had scrawled, as a specimen, a few bars at the end of her note,
mystic, mocking musical signs which had no sense for her
correspondent.&nbsp; The whole letter testified to a restless but
rather pointless desire to remain in communication with
him.&nbsp; In answering her, however, which he did that night
before going to bed, it was on this bright possibility of their
collaboration, its advantages for the future of each of them,
that Baron principally expatiated.&nbsp; He spoke of this future
with an eloquence of which he would have defended the sincerity,
and drew of it a picture extravagantly rich.&nbsp; The next
morning, as he was about to settle himself to tasks for some time
terribly neglected, with a sense that after all it was rather a
relief not to be sitting so close to Sir Dominick Ferrand, who
had become dreadfully distracting; at the very moment at which he
habitually addressed his preliminary invocation to the muse, he
was agitated by the arrival of a telegram which proved to be an
urgent request from Mr. Locket that he would immediately come
down and see him.&nbsp; This represented, for poor Baron, whose
funds were very low, another morning sacrificed, but somehow it
didn&rsquo;t even occur to him that he might impose his own time
upon the editor of the Promiscuous, the keeper of the keys of
renown.&nbsp; He had some of the plasticity of the raw
contributor.&nbsp; He gave the muse another holiday, feeling she
was really ashamed to take it, and in course of time found
himself in Mr. Locket&rsquo;s own chair at Mr. Locket&rsquo;s own
table&mdash;so much nobler an expanse than the slippery slope of
the davenport&mdash;considering with quick intensity, in the
white flash of certain words just brought out by his host, the
quantity of happiness, of emancipation that might reside in a
hundred pounds.</p>
<p>Yes, that was what it meant: Mr. Locket, in the twenty-four
hours, had discovered so much in Sir Dominick&rsquo;s literary
remains that his visitor found him primed with an offer.&nbsp; A
hundred pounds would be paid him that day, that minute, and no
questions would be either asked or answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;I take
all the risks, I take all the risks,&rdquo; the editor of the
Promiscuous repeated.&nbsp; The letters were out on the table,
Mr. Locket was on the hearthrug, like an orator on a platform,
and Peter, under the influence of his sudden ultimatum, had
dropped, rather weakly, into the seat which happened to be
nearest and which, as he became conscious it moved on a pivot, he
whirled round so as to enable himself to look at his tempter with
an eye intended to be cold.&nbsp; What surprised him most was to
find Mr. Locket taking exactly the line about the expediency of
publication which he would have expected Mr. Locket not to
take.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hush it all up; a barren scandal, an offence
that can&rsquo;t be remedied, is the thing in the world that
least justifies an airing&mdash;&rdquo; some such line as that
was the line he would have thought natural to a man whose life
was spent in weighing questions of propriety and who had only the
other day objected, in the light of this virtue, to a work of the
most disinterested art.&nbsp; But the author of that
incorruptible masterpiece had put his finger on the place in
saying to his interlocutor on the occasion of his last visit
that, if given to the world in the pages of the Promiscuous, Sir
Dominick&rsquo;s aberrations would sell the edition.&nbsp; It was
not necessary for Mr. Locket to reiterate to his young friend his
phrase about their making a sensation.&nbsp; If he wished to
purchase the &ldquo;rights,&rdquo; as theatrical people said, it
was not to protect a celebrated name or to lock them up in a
cupboard.&nbsp; That formula of Baron&rsquo;s covered all the
ground, and one edition was a low estimate of the probable
performance of the magazine.</p>
<p>Peter left the letters behind him and, on withdrawing from the
editorial presence, took a long walk on the Embankment.&nbsp; His
impressions were at war with each other&mdash;he was flurried by
possibilities of which he yet denied the existence.&nbsp; He had
consented to trust Mr. Locket with the papers a day or two
longer, till he should have thought out the terms on which he
might&mdash;in the event of certain occurrences&mdash;be induced
to dispose of them.&nbsp; A hundred pounds were not this
gentleman&rsquo;s last word, nor perhaps was mere unreasoning
intractability Peter&rsquo;s own.&nbsp; He sighed as he took no
note of the pictures made by barges&mdash;sighed because it all
might mean money.&nbsp; He needed money bitterly; he owed it in
disquieting quarters.&nbsp; Mr. Locket had put it before him that
he had a high responsibility&mdash;that he might vindicate the
disfigured truth, contribute a chapter to the history of
England.&nbsp; &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t a right to suppress such
momentous facts,&rdquo; the hungry little editor had declared,
thinking how the series (he would spread it into three numbers)
would be the talk of the town.&nbsp; If Peter had money he might
treat himself to ardour, to bliss.&nbsp; Mr. Locket had said, no
doubt justly enough, that there were ever so many questions one
would have to meet should one venture to play so daring a
game.&nbsp; These questions, embarrassments, dangers&mdash;the
danger, for instance, of the cropping-up of some lurking
litigious relative&mdash;he would take over unreservedly and bear
the brunt of dealing with.&nbsp; It was to be remembered that the
papers were discredited, vitiated by their childish pedigree;
such a preposterous origin, suggesting, as he had hinted before,
the feeble ingenuity of a third-rate novelist, was a thing he
should have to place himself at the positive disadvantage of
being silent about.&nbsp; He would rather give no account of the
matter at all than expose himself to the ridicule that such a
story would infallibly excite.&nbsp; Couldn&rsquo;t one see them
in advance, the clever, taunting things the daily and weekly
papers would say?&nbsp; Peter Baron had his guileless side, but
he felt, as he worried with a stick that betrayed him the granite
parapets of the Thames, that he was not such a fool as not to
know how Mr. Locket would &ldquo;work&rdquo; the mystery of his
marvellous find.&nbsp; Nothing could help it on better with the
public than the impenetrability of the secret attached to
it.&nbsp; If Mr. Locket should only be able to kick up dust
enough over the circumstances that had guided his hand his
fortune would literally be made.&nbsp; Peter thought a hundred
pounds a low bid, yet he wondered how the Promiscuous could bring
itself to offer such a sum&mdash;so large it loomed in the light
of literary remuneration as hitherto revealed to our young
man.&nbsp; The explanation of this anomaly was of course that the
editor shrewdly saw a dozen ways of getting his money back.&nbsp;
There would be in the &ldquo;sensation,&rdquo; at a later stage,
the making of a book in large type&mdash;the book of the hour;
and the profits of this scandalous volume or, if one preferred
the name, this reconstruction, before an impartial posterity, of
a great historical humbug, the sum &ldquo;down,&rdquo; in other
words, that any lively publisher would give for it, figured
vividly in Mr. Locket&rsquo;s calculations.&nbsp; It was
therefore altogether an opportunity of dealing at first hand with
the lively publisher that Peter was invited to forego.&nbsp;
Peter gave a masterful laugh, rejoicing in his heart that, on the
spot, in the <i>repaire</i> he had lately quitted, he had not
been tempted by a figure that would have approximately
represented the value of his property.&nbsp; It was a good job,
he mentally added as he turned his face homeward, that there was
so little likelihood of his having to struggle with that
particular pressure.</p>
<h3>VI.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span>, half an hour later, he
approached Jersey Villas, he noticed that the house-door was
open; then, as he reached the gate, saw it make a frame for an
unexpected presence.&nbsp; Mrs. Ryves, in her bonnet and jacket,
looked out from it as if she were expecting something&mdash;as if
she had been passing to and fro to watch.&nbsp; Yet when he had
expressed to her that it was a delightful welcome she replied
that she had only thought there might possibly be a cab in
sight.&nbsp; He offered to go and look for one, upon which it
appeared that after all she was not, as yet at least, in
need.&nbsp; He went back with her into her sitting-room, where
she let him know that within a couple of days she had seen
clearer what was best; she had determined to quit Jersey Villas
and had come up to take away her things, which she had just been
packing and getting together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wrote you last night a charming letter in answer to
yours,&rdquo; Baron said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t mention
in yours that you were coming up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t your answer that brought me.&nbsp; It
hadn&rsquo;t arrived when I came away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see when you get back that my letter is
charming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I daresay.&rdquo;&nbsp; Baron had observed that the
room was not, as she had intimated, in confusion&mdash;Mrs.
Ryves&rsquo;s preparations for departure were not striking.&nbsp;
She saw him look round and, standing in front of the fireless
grate with her hands behind her, she suddenly asked: &ldquo;Where
have you come from now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From an interview with a literary friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you concocting between you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing at all.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve fallen out&mdash;we
don&rsquo;t agree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he a publisher?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s an editor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m glad you don&rsquo;t agree.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t know what he wants, but, whatever it is, don&rsquo;t
do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must do what <i>I</i> want!&rdquo; said Baron.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll tell you when he has done
it!&rdquo;&nbsp; Baron begged her to let him hear the
&ldquo;musical idea&rdquo; she had mentioned in her letter; on
which she took off her hat and jacket and, seating herself at her
piano, gave him, with a sentiment of which the very first notes
thrilled him, the accompaniment of his song.&nbsp; She phrased
the words with her sketchy sweetness, and he sat there as if he
had been held in a velvet vise, throbbing with the emotion,
irrecoverable ever after in its freshness, of the young artist in
the presence for the first time of
&ldquo;production&rdquo;&mdash;the proofs of his book, the
hanging of his picture, the rehearsal of his play.&nbsp; When she
had finished he asked again for the same delight, and then for
more music and for more; it did him such a world of good, kept
him quiet and safe, smoothed out the creases of his spirit.&nbsp;
She dropped her own experiments and gave him immortal things, and
he lounged there, pacified and charmed, feeling the mean little
room grow large and vague and happy possibilities come
back.&nbsp; Abruptly, at the piano, she called out to him:
&ldquo;Those papers of yours&mdash;the letters you
found&mdash;are not in the house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, they&rsquo;re not in the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was sure of it!&nbsp; No matter&mdash;it&rsquo;s all
right!&rdquo; she added.&nbsp; She herself was
pacified&mdash;trouble was a false note.&nbsp; Later he was on
the point of asking her how she knew the objects she had
mentioned were not in the house; but he let it pass.&nbsp; The
subject was a profitless riddle&mdash;a puzzle that grew
grotesquely bigger, like some monstrosity seen in the darkness,
as one opened one&rsquo;s eyes to it.&nbsp; He closed his
eyes&mdash;he wanted another vision.&nbsp; Besides, she had shown
him that she had extraordinary senses&mdash;her explanation would
have been stranger than the fact.&nbsp; Moreover they had other
things to talk about, in particular the question of her putting
off her return to Dover till the morrow and dispensing meanwhile
with the valuable protection of Sidney.&nbsp; This was indeed but
another face of the question of her dining with him somewhere
that evening (where else should she dine?)&mdash;accompanying
him, for instance, just for an hour of Bohemia, in their deadly
respectable lives, to a jolly little place in Soho.&nbsp; Mrs.
Ryves declined to have her life abused, but in fact, at the
proper moment, at the jolly little place, to which she did
accompany him&mdash;it dealt in macaroni and Chianti&mdash;the
pair put their elbows on the crumpled cloth and, face to face,
with their little emptied coffee-cups pushed away and the young
man&rsquo;s cigarette lighted by her command, became increasingly
confidential.&nbsp; They went afterwards to the theatre, in cheap
places, and came home in &ldquo;busses&rdquo; and under
umbrellas.</p>
<p>On the way back Peter Baron turned something over in his mind
as he had never turned anything before; it was the question of
whether, at the end, she would let him come into her sitting-room
for five minutes.&nbsp; He felt on this point a passion of
suspense and impatience, and yet for what would it be but to tell
her how poor he was?&nbsp; This was literally the moment to say
it, so supremely depleted had the hour of Bohemia left him.&nbsp;
Even Bohemia was too expensive, and yet in the course of the day
his whole temper on the subject of certain fitnesses had
changed.&nbsp; At Jersey Villas (it was near midnight, and Mrs.
Ryves, scratching a light for her glimmering taper, had said:
&ldquo;Oh, yes, come in for a minute if you like!&rdquo;), in her
precarious parlour, which was indeed, after the brilliances of
the evening, a return to ugliness and truth, she let him stand
while he explained that he had certainly everything in the way of
fame and fortune still to gain, but that youth and love and faith
and energy&mdash;to say nothing of her supreme
dearness&mdash;were all on his side.&nbsp; Why, if one&rsquo;s
beginnings were rough, should one add to the hardness of the
conditions by giving up the dream which, if she would only hear
him out, would make just the blessed difference?&nbsp; Whether
Mrs. Ryves heard him out or not is a circumstance as to which
this chronicle happens to be silent; but after he had got
possession of both her hands and breathed into her face for a
moment all the intensity of his tenderness&mdash;in the relief
and joy of utterance he felt it carry him like a rising
flood&mdash;she checked him with better reasons, with a cold,
sweet afterthought in which he felt there was something
deep.&nbsp; Her procrastinating head-shake was prettier than
ever, yet it had never meant so many fears and
pains&mdash;impossibilities and memories, independences and
pieties, and a sort of uncomplaining ache for the ruin of a
friendship that had been happy.&nbsp; She had liked him&mdash;if
she hadn&rsquo;t she wouldn&rsquo;t have let him think
so!&mdash;but she protested that she had not, in the odious
vulgar sense, &ldquo;encouraged&rdquo; him.&nbsp; Moreover she
couldn&rsquo;t talk of such things in that place, at that hour,
and she begged him not to make her regret her good-nature in
staying over.&nbsp; There were peculiarities in her position,
considerations insurmountable.&nbsp; She got rid of him with kind
and confused words, and afterwards, in the dull, humiliated
night, he felt that he had been put in his place.&nbsp; Women in
her situation, women who after having really loved and lost,
usually lived on into the new dawns in which old ghosts steal
away.&nbsp; But there was something in his whimsical neighbour
that struck him as terribly invulnerable.</p>
<h3>VII.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">I&rsquo;ve</span> had time to look
a little further into what we&rsquo;re prepared to do, and I find
the case is one in which I should consider the advisability of
going to an extreme length,&rdquo; said Mr. Locket.&nbsp; Jersey
Villas the next morning had had the privilege of again receiving
the editor of the Promiscuous, and he sat once more at the
davenport, where the bone of contention, in the shape of a large,
loose heap of papers that showed how much they had been handled,
was placed well in view.&nbsp; &ldquo;We shall see our way to
offering you three hundred, but we shouldn&rsquo;t, I must
positively assure you, see it a single step further.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter Baron, in his dressing-gown and slippers, with his hands
in his pockets, crept softly about the room, repeating, below his
breath and with inflections that for his own sake he endeavoured
to make humorous: &ldquo;Three hundred&mdash;three
hundred.&rdquo;&nbsp; His state of mind was far from hilarious,
for he felt poor and sore and disappointed; but he wanted to
prove to himself that he was gallant&mdash;was made, in general
and in particular, of undiscourageable stuff.&nbsp; The first
thing he had been aware of on stepping into his front room was
that a four-wheeled cab, with Mrs. Ryves&rsquo;s luggage upon it,
stood at the door of No. 3.&nbsp; Permitting himself, behind his
curtain, a pardonable peep, he saw the mistress of his thoughts
come out of the house, attended by Mrs. Bundy, and take her place
in the modest vehicle.&nbsp; After this his eyes rested for a
long time on the sprigged cotton back of the landlady, who kept
bobbing at the window of the cab an endlessly moralising old
head.&nbsp; Mrs. Ryves had really taken flight&mdash;he had made
Jersey Villas impossible for her&mdash;but Mrs. Bundy, with a
magnanimity unprecedented in the profession, seemed to express a
belief in the purity of her motives.&nbsp; Baron felt that his
own separation had been, for the present at least, effected;
every instinct of delicacy prompted him to stand back.</p>
<p>Mr. Locket talked a long time, and Peter Baron listened and
waited.&nbsp; He reflected that his willingness to listen would
probably excite hopes in his visitor&mdash;hopes which he himself
was ready to contemplate without a scruple.&nbsp; He felt no pity
for Mr. Locket and had no consideration for his suspense or for
his possible illusions; he only felt sick and forsaken and in
want of comfort and of money.&nbsp; Yet it was a kind of outrage
to his dignity to have the knife held to his throat, and he was
irritated above all by the ground on which Mr. Locket put the
question&mdash;the ground of a service rendered to historical
truth.&nbsp; It might be&mdash;he wasn&rsquo;t clear; it might
be&mdash;the question was deep, too deep, probably, for his
wisdom; at any rate he had to control himself not to interrupt
angrily such dry, interested palaver, the false voice of commerce
and of cant.&nbsp; He stared tragically out of the window and saw
the stupid rain begin to fall; the day was duller even than his
own soul, and Jersey Villas looked so sordidly hideous that it
was no wonder Mrs. Ryves couldn&rsquo;t endure them.&nbsp;
Hideous as they were he should have to tell Mrs. Bundy in the
course of the day that he was obliged to seek humbler
quarters.&nbsp; Suddenly he interrupted Mr. Locket; he observed
to him: &ldquo;I take it that if I should make you this
concession the hospitality of the Promiscuous would be by that
very fact unrestrictedly secured to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Locket stared.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Hospitality&mdash;secured?&rdquo;&nbsp; He thumbed the
proposition as if it were a hard peach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean that of course you wouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;in
courtsey, in gratitude&mdash;keep on declining my
things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should give them my best attention&mdash;as
I&rsquo;ve always done in the past.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter Baron hesitated.&nbsp; It was a case in which there
would have seemed to be some chance for the ideally shrewd
aspirant in such an advantage as he possessed; but after a moment
the blood rushed into his face with the shame of the idea of
pleading for his productions in the name of anything but their
merit.&nbsp; It was as if he had stupidly uttered evil of
them.&nbsp; Nevertheless be added the interrogation:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you for instance publish my little
story?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The one I read (and objected to some features of) the
other day?&nbsp; Do you mean&mdash;a&mdash;with the
alteration?&rdquo; Mr. Locket continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, I mean utterly without it.&nbsp; The pages you
want altered contain, as I explained to you very lucidly, I
think, the very <i>raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre</i> of the work, and
it would therefore, it seems to me, be an imbecility of the first
magnitude to cancel them.&rdquo;&nbsp; Peter had really renounced
all hope that his critic would understand what he meant, but,
under favour of circumstances, he couldn&rsquo;t forbear to taste
the luxury, which probably never again would come within his
reach, of being really plain, for one wild moment, with an
editor.</p>
<p>Mr. Locket gave a constrained smile.&nbsp; &ldquo;Think of the
scandal, Mr. Baron.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But isn&rsquo;t this other scandal just what
you&rsquo;re going in for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be a great public service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean it will be a big scandal, whereas my poor
story would be a very small one, and that it&rsquo;s only out of
a big one that money&rsquo;s to be made.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Locket got up&mdash;he too had his dignity to
vindicate.&nbsp; &ldquo;Such a sum as I offer you ought really to
be an offset against all claims.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good&mdash;I don&rsquo;t mean to make any, since
you don&rsquo;t really care for what I write.&nbsp; I take note
of your offer,&rdquo; Peter pursued, &ldquo;and I engage to give
you to-night (in a few words left by my own hand at your house)
my absolutely definite and final reply.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Locket&rsquo;s movements, as he hovered near the relics of
the eminent statesman, were those of some feathered parent
fluttering over a threatened nest.&nbsp; If he had brought his
huddled brood back with him this morning it was because he had
felt sure enough of closing the bargain to be able to be
graceful.&nbsp; He kept a glittering eye on the papers and
remarked that he was afraid that before leaving them he must
elicit some assurance that in the meanwhile Peter would not place
them in any other hands.&nbsp; Peter, at this, gave a laugh of
harsher cadence than he intended, asking, justly enough, on what
privilege his visitor rested such a demand and why he himself was
disqualified from offering his wares to the highest bidder.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Surely you wouldn&rsquo;t hawk such things about?&rdquo;
cried Mr. Locket; but before Baron had time to retort cynically
he added: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll publish your little story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, thank you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll publish anything you&rsquo;ll send
me,&rdquo; Mr. Locket continued, as he went out.&nbsp; Peter had
before this virtually given his word that for the letters he
would treat only with the Promiscuous.</p>
<p>The young man passed, during a portion of the rest of the day,
the strangest hours of his life.&nbsp; Yet he thought of them
afterwards not as a phase of temptation, though they had been
full of the emotion that accompanies an intense vision of
alternatives.&nbsp; The struggle was already over; it seemed to
him that, poor as he was, he was not poor enough to take Mr.
Locket&rsquo;s money.&nbsp; He looked at the opposed courses with
the self-possession of a man who has chosen, but this
self-possession was in itself the most exquisite of
excitements.&nbsp; It was really a high revulsion and a sort of
noble pity.&nbsp; He seemed indeed to have his finger upon the
pulse of history and to be in the secret of the gods.&nbsp; He
had them all in his hand, the tablets and the scales and the
torch.&nbsp; He couldn&rsquo;t keep a character together, but he
might easily pull one to pieces.&nbsp; That would be
&ldquo;creative work&rdquo; of a kind&mdash;he could reconstruct
the character less pleasingly, could show an unknown side of
it.&nbsp; Mr. Locket had had a good deal to say about
responsibility; and responsibility in truth sat there with him
all the morning, while he revolved in his narrow cage and,
watching the crude spring rain on the windows, thought of the
dismalness to which, at Dover, Mrs. Ryves was going back.&nbsp;
This influence took in fact the form, put on the physiognomy of
poor Sir Dominick Ferrand; he was at present as perceptible in
it, as coldly and strangely personal, as if he had been a
haunting ghost and had risen beside his own old
hearthstone.&nbsp; Our friend was accustomed to his company and
indeed had spent so many hours in it of late, following him up at
the museum and comparing his different portraits, engravings and
lithographs, in which there seemed to be conscious, pleading eyes
for the betrayer, that their queer intimacy had grown as close as
an embrace.&nbsp; Sir Dominick was very dumb, but he was terrible
in his dependence, and Peter would not have encouraged him by so
much curiosity nor reassured him by so much deference had it not
been for the young man&rsquo;s complete acceptance of the
impossibility of getting out of a tight place by exposing an
individual.&nbsp; It didn&rsquo;t matter that the individual was
dead; it didn&rsquo;t matter that he was dishonest.&nbsp; Peter
felt him sufficiently alive to suffer; he perceived the
rectification of history so conscientiously desired by Mr. Locket
to be somehow for himself not an imperative task.&nbsp; It had
come over him too definitely that in a case where one&rsquo;s
success was to hinge upon an act of extradition it would minister
most to an easy conscience to let the success go.&nbsp; No,
no&mdash;even should he be starving he couldn&rsquo;t make money
out of Sir Dominick&rsquo;s disgrace.&nbsp; He was almost
surprised at the violence of the horror with which, as he
shuffled mournfully about, the idea of any such profit inspired
him.&nbsp; What was Sir Dominick to him after all?&nbsp; He
wished he had never come across him.</p>
<p>In one of his brooding pauses at the window&mdash;the window
out of which never again apparently should he see Mrs. Ryves
glide across the little garden with the step for which he had
liked her from the first&mdash;he became aware that the rain was
about to intermit and the sun to make some grudging amends.&nbsp;
This was a sign that he might go out; he had a vague perception
that there were things to be done.&nbsp; He had work to look for,
and a cheaper lodging, and a new idea (every idea he had ever
cherished had left him), in addition to which the promised little
word was to be dropped at Mr. Locket&rsquo;s door.&nbsp; He
looked at his watch and was surprised at the hour, for he had
nothing but a heartache to show for so much time.&nbsp; He would
have to dress quickly, but as he passed to his bedroom his eye
was caught by the little pyramid of letters which Mr. Locket had
constructed on his davenport.&nbsp; They startled him and,
staring at them, he stopped for an instant, half-amused,
half-annoyed at their being still in existence.&nbsp; He had so
completely destroyed them in spirit that he had taken the act for
granted, and he was now reminded of the orderly stages of which
an intention must consist to be sincere.&nbsp; Baron went at the
papers with all his sincerity, and at his empty grate (where
there lately had been no fire and he had only to remove a
horrible ornament of tissue-paper dear to Mrs. Bundy) he burned
the collection with infinite method.&nbsp; It made him feel
happier to watch the worst pages turn to illegible ashes&mdash;if
happiness be the right word to apply to his sense, in the
process, of something so crisp and crackling that it suggested
the death-rustle of bank-notes.</p>
<p>When ten minutes later he came back into his sitting-room, he
seemed to himself oddly, unexpectedly in the presence of a bigger
view.&nbsp; It was as if some interfering mass had been so
displaced that he could see more sky and more country.&nbsp; Yet
the opposite houses were naturally still there, and if the grimy
little place looked lighter it was doubtless only because the
rain had indeed stopped and the sun was pouring in.&nbsp; Peter
went to the window to open it to the altered air, and in doing so
beheld at the garden gate the humble &ldquo;growler&rdquo; in
which a few hours before he had seen Mrs. Ryves take her
departure.&nbsp; It was unmistakable&mdash;he remembered the
knock-kneed white horse; but this made the fact that his
friend&rsquo;s luggage no longer surmounted it only the more
mystifying.&nbsp; Perhaps the cabman had already removed the
luggage&mdash;he was now on his box smoking the short pipe that
derived relish from inaction paid for.&nbsp; As Peter turned into
the room again his ears caught a knock at his own door, a knock
explained, as soon as he had responded, by the hard breathing of
Mrs. Bundy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, sir, it&rsquo;s to say she&rsquo;ve come
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has she come back for?&rdquo; Baron&rsquo;s
question sounded ungracious, but his heartache had given another
throb, and he felt a dread of another wound.&nbsp; It was like a
practical joke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s for you, sir,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Bundy.&nbsp; &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll see you for a moment, if
you&rsquo;ll be so good, in the old place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter followed his hostess downstairs, and Mrs. Bundy ushered
him, with her company flourish, into the apartment she had fondly
designated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went away this morning, and I&rsquo;ve only returned
for an instant,&rdquo; said Mrs. Ryves, as soon as Mrs. Bundy had
closed the door.&nbsp; He saw that she was different now;
something had happened that had made her indulgent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you been all the way to Dover and back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but I&rsquo;ve been to Victoria.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
left my luggage there&mdash;I&rsquo;ve been driving
about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ve enjoyed it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very much.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been to see Mr.
Morrish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Morrish?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The musical publisher.&nbsp; I showed him our
song.&nbsp; I played it for him, and he&rsquo;s delighted with
it.&nbsp; He declares it&rsquo;s just the thing.&nbsp; He has
given me fifty pounds.&nbsp; I think he believes in us,&rdquo;
Mrs. Ryves went on, while Baron stared at the wonder&mdash;too
sweet to be safe, it seemed to him as yet&mdash;of her standing
there again before him and speaking of what they had in
common.&nbsp; &ldquo;Fifty pounds! fifty pounds!&rdquo; she
exclaimed, fluttering at him her happy cheque.&nbsp; She had come
back, the first thing, to tell him, and of course his share of
the money would be the half.&nbsp; She was rosy, jubilant,
natural, she chattered like a happy woman.&nbsp; She said they
must do more, ever so much more.&nbsp; Mr. Morrish had
practically promised he would take anything that was as good as
that.&nbsp; She had kept her cab because she was going to Dover;
she couldn&rsquo;t leave the others alone.&nbsp; It was a vehicle
infirm and inert, but Baron, after a little, appreciated its
pace, for she had consented to his getting in with her and
driving, this time in earnest, to Victoria.&nbsp; She had only
come to tell him the good news&mdash;she repeated this assurance
more than once.&nbsp; They talked of it so profoundly that it
drove everything else for the time out of his head&mdash;his duty
to Mr. Locket, the remarkable sacrifice he had just achieved, and
even the odd coincidence, matching with the oddity of all the
others, of her having reverted to the house again, as if with one
of her famous divinations, at the very moment the trumpery
papers, the origin really of their intimacy, had ceased to
exist.&nbsp; But she, on her side, also had evidently forgotten
the trumpery papers: she never mentioned them again, and Peter
Baron never boasted of what he had done with them.&nbsp; He was
silent for a while, from curiosity to see if her fine nerves had
really given her a hint; and then later, when it came to be a
question of his permanent attitude, he was silent, prodigiously,
religiously, tremulously silent, in consequence of an
extraordinary conversation that he had with her.</p>
<p>This conversation took place at Dover, when he went down to
give her the money for which, at Mr. Morrish&rsquo;s bank, he had
exchanged the cheque she had left with him.&nbsp; That cheque, or
rather certain things it represented, had made somehow all the
difference in their relations.&nbsp; The difference was huge, and
Baron could think of nothing but this confirmed vision of their
being able to work fruitfully together that would account for so
rapid a change.&nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t talk of impossibilities
now&mdash;she didn&rsquo;t seem to want to stop him off; only
when, the day following his arrival at Dover with the fifty
pounds (he had after all to agree to share them with her&mdash;he
couldn&rsquo;t expect her to take a present of money from him),
he returned to the question over which they had had their little
scene the night they dined together&mdash;on this occasion (he
had brought a portmanteau and he was staying) she mentioned that
there was something very particular she had it on her conscience
to tell him before letting him commit himself.&nbsp; There dawned
in her face as she approached the subject a light of warning that
frightened him; it was charged with something so strange that for
an instant he held his breath.&nbsp; This flash of ugly
possibilities passed however, and it was with the gesture of
taking still tenderer possession of her, checked indeed by the
grave, important way she held up a finger, that he answered:
&ldquo;Tell me everything&mdash;tell me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must know what I am&mdash;who I am; you must know
especially what I&rsquo;m not!&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a name for it,
a hideous, cruel name.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not my fault!&nbsp;
Others have known, I&rsquo;ve had to speak of it&mdash;it has
made a great difference in my life.&nbsp; Surely you must have
guessed!&rdquo; she went on, with the thinnest quaver of irony,
letting him now take her hand, which felt as cold as her hard
duty.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see I&rsquo;ve no belongings,
no relations, no friends, nothing at all, in all the world, of my
own?&nbsp; I was only a poor girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A poor girl?&rdquo; Baron was mystified, touched,
distressed, piecing dimly together what she meant, but feeling,
in a great surge of pity, that it was only something more to love
her for.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother&mdash;my poor mother,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Ryves.</p>
<p>She paused with this, and through gathering tears her eyes met
his as if to plead with him to understand.&nbsp; He understood,
and drew her closer, but she kept herself free still, to
continue: &ldquo;She was a poor girl&mdash;she was only a
governess; she was alone, she thought he loved her.&nbsp; He
did&mdash;I think it was the only happiness she ever knew.&nbsp;
But she died of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so glad you tell me&mdash;it&rsquo;s so
grand of you!&rdquo; Baron murmured.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then&mdash;your
father?&rdquo;&nbsp; He hesitated, as if with his hands on old
wounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had his own troubles, but he was kind to her.&nbsp;
It was all misery and folly&mdash;he was married.&nbsp; He
wasn&rsquo;t happy&mdash;there were good reasons, I believe, for
that.&nbsp; I know it from letters, I know it from a person
who&rsquo;s dead.&nbsp; Everyone is dead now&mdash;it&rsquo;s too
far off.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the only good thing.&nbsp; He was
very kind to me; I remember him, though I didn&rsquo;t know then,
as a little girl, who he was.&nbsp; He put me with some very good
people&mdash;he did what he could for me.&nbsp; I think, later,
his wife knew&mdash;a lady who came to see me once after his
death.&nbsp; I was a very little girl, but I remember many
things.&nbsp; What he could he did&mdash;something that helped me
afterwards, something that helps me now.&nbsp; I think of him
with a strange pity&mdash;I <i>see</i> him!&rdquo; said Mrs.
Ryves, with the faint past in her eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
mustn&rsquo;t say anything against him,&rdquo; she added, gently
and gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never&mdash;never; for he has only made it more of a
rapture to care for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must wait, you must think; we must wait
together,&rdquo; she went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t tell,
and you must give me time.&nbsp; Now that you know, it&rsquo;s
all right; but you had to know.&nbsp; Doesn&rsquo;t it make us
better friends?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Ryves, with a tired smile which
had the effect of putting the whole story further and further
away.&nbsp; The next moment, however, she added quickly, as if
with the sense that it couldn&rsquo;t be far enough: &ldquo;You
don&rsquo;t know, you can&rsquo;t judge, you must let it
settle.&nbsp; Think of it, think of it; oh you will, and leave it
so.&nbsp; I must have time myself, oh I must!&nbsp; Yes, you must
believe me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned away from him, and he remained looking at her a
moment.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah, how I shall work for you!&rdquo; he
exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must work for yourself; I&rsquo;ll help
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; Her eyes had met his eyes again, and she added,
hesitating, thinking: &ldquo;You had better know, perhaps, who he
was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Baron shook his head, smiling confidently.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t care a straw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do&mdash;a little.&nbsp; He was a great
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There must indeed have been some good in
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was a high celebrity.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve often heard
of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Baron wondered an instant.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no doubt
you&rsquo;re a princess!&rdquo; he said with a laugh.&nbsp; She
made him nervous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not ashamed of him.&nbsp; He was Sir Dominick
Ferrand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Baron saw in her face, in a few seconds, that she had seen
something in his.&nbsp; He knew that he stared, then turned pale;
it had the effect of a powerful shock.&nbsp; He was cold for an
instant, as he had just found her, with the sense of danger, the
confused horror of having dealt a blow.&nbsp; But the blood
rushed back to its courses with his still quicker consciousness
of safety, and he could make out, as he recovered his balance,
that his emotion struck her simply as a violent surprise.&nbsp;
He gave a muffled murmur: &ldquo;Ah, it&rsquo;s you, my
beloved!&rdquo; which lost itself as he drew her close and held
her long, in the intensity of his embrace and the wonder of his
escape.&nbsp; It took more than a minute for him to say over to
himself often enough, with his hidden face: &ldquo;Ah, she must
never, never know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She never knew; she only learned, when she asked him casually,
that he had in fact destroyed the old documents she had had such
a comic caprice about.&nbsp; The sensibility, the curiosity they
had had the queer privilege of exciting in her had lapsed with
the event as irresponsibly as they had arisen, and she appeared
to have forgotten, or rather to attribute now to other causes,
the agitation and several of the odd incidents that accompanied
them.&nbsp; They naturally gave Peter Baron rather more to think
about, much food, indeed, for clandestine meditation, some of
which, in spite of the pains he took not to be caught, was noted
by his friend and interpreted, to his knowledge, as depression
produced by the long probation she succeeded in imposing on
him.&nbsp; He was more patient than she could guess, with all her
guessing, for if he was put to the proof she herself was not left
undissected.&nbsp; It came back to him again and again that if
the documents he had burned proved anything they proved that Sir
Dominick Ferrand&rsquo;s human errors were not all of one
order.&nbsp; The woman he loved was the daughter of her father,
he couldn&rsquo;t get over that.&nbsp; What was more to the point
was that as he came to know her better and better&mdash;for they
did work together under Mr. Morrish&rsquo;s protection&mdash;his
affection was a quantity still less to be neglected.&nbsp; He
sometimes wondered, in the light of her general straightness
(their marriage had brought out even more than he believed there
was of it) whether the relics in the davenport were
genuine.&nbsp; That piece of furniture is still almost as useful
to him as Mr. Morrish&rsquo;s patronage.&nbsp; There is a
tremendous run, as this gentlemen calls it, on several of their
songs.&nbsp; Baron nevertheless still tries his hand also at
prose, and his offerings are now not always declined by the
magazines.&nbsp; But he has never approached the Promiscuous
again.&nbsp; This periodical published in due course a highly
eulogistic study of the remarkable career of Sir Dominick
Ferrand.</p>

<h3>I.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;I <span class="smcap">wondered</span> whether you
wouldn&rsquo;t read it to me,&rdquo; said Mrs. Alsager, as they
lingered a little near the fire before he took leave.&nbsp; She
looked down at the fire sideways, drawing her dress away from it
and making her proposal with a shy sincerity that added to her
charm.&nbsp; Her charm was always great for Allan Wayworth, and
the whole air of her house, which was simply a sort of
distillation of herself, so soothing, so beguiling that he always
made several false starts before departure.&nbsp; He had spent
some such good hours there, had forgotten, in her warm, golden
drawing-room, so much of the loneliness and so many of the
worries of his life, that it had come to be the immediate answer
to his longings, the cure for his aches, the harbour of refuge
from his storms.&nbsp; His tribulations were not unprecedented,
and some of his advantages, if of a usual kind, were marked in
degree, inasmuch as he was very clever for one so young, and very
independent for one so poor.&nbsp; He was eight-and-twenty, but
he had lived a good deal and was full of ambitions and
curiosities and disappointments.&nbsp; The opportunity to talk of
some of these in Grosvenor Place corrected perceptibly the
immense inconvenience of London.&nbsp; This inconvenience took
for him principally the line of insensibility to Allan
Wayworth&rsquo;s literary form.&nbsp; He had a literary form, or
he thought he had, and her intelligent recognition of the
circumstance was the sweetest consolation Mrs. Alsager could have
administered.&nbsp; She was even more literary and more artistic
than he, inasmuch as he could often work off his overflow (this
was his occupation, his profession), while the generous woman,
abounding in happy thoughts, but unedited and unpublished, stood
there in the rising tide like the nymph of a fountain in the
plash of the marble basin.</p>
<p>The year before, in a big newspapery house, he had found
himself next her at dinner, and they had converted the intensely
material hour into a feast of reason.&nbsp; There was no motive
for her asking him to come to see her but that she liked him,
which it was the more agreeable to him to perceive as he
perceived at the same time that she was exquisite.&nbsp; She was
enviably free to act upon her likings, and it made Wayworth feel
less unsuccessful to infer that for the moment he happened to be
one of them.&nbsp; He kept the revelation to himself, and indeed
there was nothing to turn his head in the kindness of a kind
woman.&nbsp; Mrs. Alsager occupied so completely the ground of
possession that she would have been condemned to inaction had it
not been for the principle of giving.&nbsp; Her husband, who was
twenty years her senior, a massive personality in the City and a
heavy one at home (wherever he stood, or even sat, he was
monumental), owned half a big newspaper and the whole of a great
many other things.&nbsp; He admired his wife, though she bore no
children, and liked her to have other tastes than his, as that
seemed to give a greater acreage to their life.&nbsp; His own
appetites went so far he could scarcely see the boundary, and his
theory was to trust her to push the limits of hers, so that
between them the pair should astound by their consumption.&nbsp;
His ideas were prodigiously vulgar, but some of them had the good
fortune to be carried out by a person of perfect delicacy.&nbsp;
Her delicacy made her play strange tricks with them, but he never
found this out.&nbsp; She attenuated him without his knowing it,
for what he mainly thought was that he had aggrandised
<i>her</i>.&nbsp; Without her he really would have been bigger
still, and society, breathing more freely, was practically under
an obligation to her which, to do it justice, it acknowledged by
an attitude of mystified respect.&nbsp; She felt a tremulous need
to throw her liberty and her leisure into the things of the
soul&mdash;the most beautiful things she knew.&nbsp; She found
them, when she gave time to seeking, in a hundred places, and
particularly in a dim and sacred region&mdash;the region of
active pity&mdash;over her entrance into which she dropped
curtains so thick that it would have been an impertinence to lift
them.&nbsp; But she cultivated other beneficent passions, and if
she cherished the dream of something fine the moments at which it
most seemed to her to come true were when she saw beauty plucked
flower-like in the garden of art.&nbsp; She loved the perfect
work&mdash;she had the artistic chord.&nbsp; This chord could
vibrate only to the touch of another, so that appreciation, in
her spirit, had the added intensity of regret.&nbsp; She could
understand the joy of creation, and she thought it scarcely
enough to be told that she herself created happiness.&nbsp; She
would have liked, at any rate, to choose her way; but it was just
here that her liberty failed her.&nbsp; She had not the
voice&mdash;she had only the vision.&nbsp; The only envy she was
capable of was directed to those who, as she said, could do
something.</p>
<p>As everything in her, however, turned to gentleness, she was
admirably hospitable to such people as a class.&nbsp; She
believed Allan Wayworth could do something, and she liked to hear
him talk of the ways in which he meant to show it.&nbsp; He
talked of them almost to no one else&mdash;she spoiled him for
other listeners.&nbsp; With her fair bloom and her quiet grace
she was indeed an ideal public, and if she had ever confided to
him that she would have liked to scribble (she had in fact not
mentioned it to a creature), he would have been in a perfect
position for asking her why a woman whose face had so much
expression should not have felt that she achieved.&nbsp; How in
the world could she express better?&nbsp; There was less than
that in Shakespeare and Beethoven.&nbsp; She had never been more
generous than when, in compliance with her invitation, which I
have recorded, he brought his play to read to her.&nbsp; He had
spoken of it to her before, and one dark November afternoon, when
her red fireside was more than ever an escape from the place and
the season, he had broken out as he came
in&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done it, I&rsquo;ve done
it!&rdquo;&nbsp; She made him tell her all about it&mdash;she
took an interest really minute and asked questions delightfully
apt.&nbsp; She had spoken from the first as if he were on the
point of being acted, making him jump, with her participation,
all sorts of dreary intervals.&nbsp; She liked the theatre as she
liked all the arts of expression, and he had known her to go all
the way to Paris for a particular performance.&nbsp; Once he had
gone with her&mdash;the time she took that stupid Mrs.
Mostyn.&nbsp; She had been struck, when he sketched it, with the
subject of his drama, and had spoken words that helped him to
believe in it.&nbsp; As soon as he had rung down his curtain on
the last act he rushed off to see her, but after that he kept the
thing for repeated last touches.&nbsp; Finally, on Christmas day,
by arrangement, she sat there and listened to it.&nbsp; It was in
three acts and in prose, but rather of the romantic order, though
dealing with contemporary English life, and he fondly believed
that it showed the hand if not of the master, at least of the
prize pupil.</p>
<p>Allan Wayworth had returned to England, at two-and-twenty,
after a miscellaneous continental education; his father, the
correspondent, for years, in several foreign countries
successively, of a conspicuous London journal, had died just
after this, leaving his mother and her two other children,
portionless girls, to subsist on a very small income in a very
dull German town.&nbsp; The young man&rsquo;s beginnings in
London were difficult, and he had aggravated them by his dislike
of journalism.&nbsp; His father&rsquo;s connection with it would
have helped him, but he was (insanely, most of his friends
judged&mdash;the great exception was always Mrs. Alsager)
<i>intraitable</i> on the question of form.&nbsp; Form&mdash;in
his sense&mdash;was not demanded by English newspapers, and he
couldn&rsquo;t give it to them in <i>their</i> sense.&nbsp; The
demand for it was not great anywhere, and Wayworth spent costly
weeks in polishing little compositions for magazines that
didn&rsquo;t pay for style.&nbsp; The only person who paid for it
was really Mrs. Alsager: she had an infallible instinct for the
perfect.&nbsp; She paid in her own way, and if Allan Wayworth had
been a wage-earning person it would have made him feel that if he
didn&rsquo;t receive his legal dues his palm was at least
occasionally conscious of a gratuity.&nbsp; He had his
limitations, his perversities, but the finest parts of him were
the most alive, and he was restless and sincere.&nbsp; It is
however the impression he produced on Mrs. Alsager that most
concerns us: she thought him not only remarkably good-looking but
altogether original.&nbsp; There were some usual bad things he
would never do&mdash;too many prohibitive puddles for him in the
short cut to success.</p>
<p>For himself, he had never been so happy as since he had seen
his way, as he fondly believed, to some sort of mastery of the
scenic idea, which struck him as a very different matter now that
he looked at it from within.&nbsp; He had had his early days of
contempt for it, when it seemed to him a jewel, dim at the best,
hidden in a dunghill, a taper burning low in an air thick with
vulgarity.&nbsp; It was hedged about with sordid approaches, it
was not worth sacrifice and suffering.&nbsp; The man of letters,
in dealing with it, would have to put off all literature, which
was like asking the bearer of a noble name to forego his
immemorial heritage.&nbsp; Aspects change, however, with the
point of view: Wayworth had waked up one morning in a different
bed altogether.&nbsp; It is needless here to trace this accident
to its source; it would have been much more interesting to a
spectator of the young man&rsquo;s life to follow some of the
consequences.&nbsp; He had been made (as he felt) the subject of
a special revelation, and he wore his hat like a man in
love.&nbsp; An angel had taken him by the hand and guided him to
the shabby door which opens, it appeared, into an interior both
splendid and austere.&nbsp; The scenic idea was magnificent when
once you had embraced it&mdash;the dramatic form had a purity
which made some others look ingloriously rough.&nbsp; It had the
high dignity of the exact sciences, it was mathematical and
architectural.&nbsp; It was full of the refreshment of
calculation and construction, the incorruptibility of line and
law.&nbsp; It was bare, but it was erect, it was poor, but it was
noble; it reminded him of some sovereign famed for justice who
should have lived in a palace despoiled.&nbsp; There was a
fearful amount of concession in it, but what you kept had a rare
intensity.&nbsp; You were perpetually throwing over the cargo to
save the ship, but what a motion you gave her when you made her
ride the waves&mdash;a motion as rhythmic as the dance of a
goddess!&nbsp; Wayworth took long London walks and thought of
these things&mdash;London poured into his ears the mighty hum of
its suggestion.&nbsp; His imagination glowed and melted down
material, his intentions multiplied and made the air a golden
haze.&nbsp; He saw not only the thing he should do, but the next
and the next and the next; the future opened before him and he
seemed to walk on marble slabs.&nbsp; The more he tried the
dramatic form the more he loved it, the more he looked at it the
more he perceived in it.&nbsp; What he perceived in it indeed he
now perceived everywhere; if he stopped, in the London dusk,
before some flaring shop-window, the place immediately
constituted itself behind footlights, became a framed stage for
his figures.&nbsp; He hammered at these figures in his lonely
lodging, he shaped them and he shaped their tabernacle; he was
like a goldsmith chiselling a casket, bent over with the passion
for perfection.&nbsp; When he was neither roaming the streets
with his vision nor worrying his problem at his table, he was
exchanging ideas on the general question with Mrs. Alsager, to
whom he promised details that would amuse her in later and still
happier hours.&nbsp; Her eyes were full of tears when he read her
the last words of the finished work, and she murmured,
divinely&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now&mdash;to get it done, to get it
done!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed&mdash;to get it done!&rdquo; Wayworth
stared at the fire, slowly rolling up his type-copy.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s a totally different part of the business,
and altogether secondary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But of course you want to be acted?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I do&mdash;but it&rsquo;s a sudden
descent.&nbsp; I want to intensely, but I&rsquo;m sorry I want
to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s there indeed that the difficulties
begin,&rdquo; said Mrs. Alsager, a little off her guard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can you say that?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s there that they
end!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, wait to see where they end!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean they&rsquo;ll now be of a totally different
order,&rdquo; Wayworth explained.&nbsp; &ldquo;It seems to me
there can be nothing in the world more difficult than to write a
play that will stand an all-round test, and that in comparison
with them the complications that spring up at this point are of
an altogether smaller kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they&rsquo;re not inspiring,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Alsager; &ldquo;they&rsquo;re discouraging, because they&rsquo;re
vulgar.&nbsp; The other problem, the working out of the thing
itself, is pure art.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How well you understand everything!&rdquo;&nbsp; The
young man had got up, nervously, and was leaning against the
chimney-piece with his back to the fire and his arms
folded.&nbsp; The roll of his copy, in his fist, was squeezed
into the hollow of one of them.&nbsp; He looked down at Mrs.
Alsager, smiling gratefully, and she answered him with a smile
from eyes still charmed and suffused.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, the
vulgarity will begin now,&rdquo; he presently added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll suffer dreadfully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall suffer in a good cause.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, giving <i>that</i> to the world!&nbsp; You must
leave it with me, I must read it over and over,&rdquo; Mrs.
Alsager pleaded, rising to come nearer and draw the copy, in its
cover of greenish-grey paper, which had a generic identity now to
him, out of his grasp.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who in the world will do
it?&mdash;who in the world <i>can</i>?&rdquo; she went on, close
to him, turning over the leaves.&nbsp; Before he could answer she
had stopped at one of the pages; she turned the book round to
him, pointing out a speech.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the most
beautiful place&mdash;those lines are a perfection.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He glanced at the spot she indicated, and she begged him to read
them again&mdash;he had read them admirably before.&nbsp; He knew
them by heart, and, closing the book while she held the other end
of it, he murmured them over to her&mdash;they had indeed a
cadence that pleased him&mdash;watching, with a facetious
complacency which he hoped was pardonable, the applause in her
face.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah, who can utter such lines as
<i>that</i>?&rdquo; Mrs. Alsager broke out; &ldquo;whom can you
find to do <i>her</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find people to do them all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not people who are worthy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be worthy enough if they&rsquo;re willing
enough.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll work with them&mdash;I&rsquo;ll grind it
into them.&rdquo;&nbsp; He spoke as if he had produced twenty
plays.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it will be interesting!&rdquo; she echoed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I shall have to find my theatre first.&nbsp; I
shall have to get a manager to believe in me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;they&rsquo;re so stupid!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But fancy the patience I shall want, and how I shall
have to watch and wait,&rdquo; said Allan Wayworth.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Do you see me hawking it about London?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed I don&rsquo;t&mdash;it would be
sickening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s what I shall have to do.&nbsp; I shall be
old before it&rsquo;s produced.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be old very soon if it isn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Mrs.
Alsager cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know one or two of them,&rdquo; she
mused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean you would speak to them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The thing is to get them to read it.&nbsp; I could do
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the utmost I ask.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s
even for that I shall have to wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at him with kind sisterly eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, you dear lady!&rdquo; Wayworth murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is <i>you</i> may, but <i>I</i> won&rsquo;t!&nbsp;
Will you leave me your copy?&rdquo; she went on, turning the
pages again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly; I have another.&rdquo;&nbsp; Standing near
him she read to herself a passage here and there; then, in her
sweet voice, she read some of them out.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, if
<i>you</i> were only an actress!&rdquo; the young man
exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the last thing I am.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
no comedy in <i>me</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had never appeared to Wayworth so much his good
genius.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is there any tragedy?&rdquo; he asked, with
the levity of complete confidence.</p>
<p>She turned away from him, at this, with a strange and charming
laugh and a &ldquo;Perhaps that will be for you to
determine!&rdquo;&nbsp; But before he could disclaim such a
responsibility she had faced him again and was talking about Nona
Vincent as if she had been the most interesting of their friends
and her situation at that moment an irresistible appeal to their
sympathy.&nbsp; Nona Vincent was the heroine of the play, and
Mrs. Alsager had taken a tremendous fancy to her.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t <i>tell</i> you how I like that woman!&rdquo; she
exclaimed in a pensive rapture of credulity which could only be
balm to the artistic spirit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully glad she lives a bit.&nbsp; What I
feel about her is that she&rsquo;s a good deal like
<i>you</i>,&rdquo; Wayworth observed.</p>
<p>Mrs. Alsager stared an instant and turned faintly red.&nbsp;
This was evidently a view that failed to strike her; she
didn&rsquo;t, however, treat it as a joke.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
not impressed with the resemblance.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t see
myself doing what she does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t so much what she <i>does</i>,&rdquo; the
young man argued, drawing out his moustache.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what she does is the whole point.&nbsp; She simply
tells her love&mdash;I should never do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you repudiate such a proceeding with such energy,
why do you like her for it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t what I like her for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What else, then?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s intensely
characteristic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Alsager reflected, looking down at the fire; she had the
air of having half-a-dozen reasons to choose from.&nbsp; But the
one she produced was unexpectedly simple; it might even have been
prompted by despair at not finding others.&nbsp; &ldquo;I like
her because <i>you</i> made her!&rdquo; she exclaimed with a
laugh, moving again away from her companion.</p>
<p>Wayworth laughed still louder.&nbsp; &ldquo;You made her a
little yourself.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve thought of her as looking like
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She ought to look much better,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Alsager.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, certainly, I shouldn&rsquo;t do what
<i>she</i> does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not even in the same circumstances?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should never find myself in such circumstances.&nbsp;
They&rsquo;re exactly your play, and have nothing in common with
such a life as mine.&nbsp; However,&rdquo; Mrs. Alsager went on,
&ldquo;her behaviour was natural for <i>her</i>, and not only
natural, but, it seems to me, thoroughly beautiful and
noble.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t sufficiently admire the talent and
tact with which you make one accept it, and I tell you frankly
that it&rsquo;s evident to me there must be a brilliant future
before a young man who, at the start, has been capable of such a
stroke as that.&nbsp; Thank heaven I can admire Nona Vincent as
intensely as I feel that I don&rsquo;t resemble her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t exaggerate that,&rdquo; said Allan
Wayworth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My admiration?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your dissimilarity.&nbsp; She has your face, your air,
your voice, your motion; she has many elements of your
being.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then she&rsquo;ll damn your play!&rdquo; Mrs. Alsager
replied.&nbsp; They joked a little over this, though it was not
in the tone of pleasantry that Wayworth&rsquo;s hostess soon
remarked: &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got your remedy, however: have her
done by the right woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, have her &lsquo;done&rsquo;&mdash;have her
&lsquo;done&rsquo;!&rdquo; the young man gently wailed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see what you mean, my poor friend.&nbsp; What a pity,
when it&rsquo;s such a magnificent part&mdash;such a chance for a
clever serious girl!&nbsp; Nona Vincent is practically your
play&mdash;it will be open to her to carry it far or to drop it
at the first corner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a charming prospect,&rdquo; said Allan
Wayworth, with sudden scepticism.&nbsp; They looked at each other
with eyes that, for a lurid moment, saw the worst of the worst;
but before they parted they had exchanged vows and confidences
that were dedicated wholly to the ideal.&nbsp; It is not to be
supposed, however, that the knowledge that Mrs. Alsager would
help him made Wayworth less eager to help himself.&nbsp; He did
what he could and felt that she, on her side, was doing no less;
but at the end of a year he was obliged to recognise that their
united effort had mainly produced the fine flower of
discouragement.&nbsp; At the end of a year the lustre had, to his
own eyes, quite faded from his unappreciated masterpiece, and he
found himself writing for a biographical dictionary little lives
of celebrities he had never heard of.&nbsp; To be printed,
anywhere and anyhow, was a form of glory for a man so unable to
be acted, and to be paid, even at encyclop&aelig;dic rates, had
the consequence of making one resigned and verbose.&nbsp; He
couldn&rsquo;t smuggle style into a dictionary, but he could at
least reflect that he had done his best to learn from the drama
that it is a gross impertinence almost anywhere.&nbsp; He had
knocked at the door of every theatre in London, and, at a ruinous
expense, had multiplied type-copies of <i>Nona Vincent</i> to
replace the neat transcripts that had descended into the
managerial abyss.&nbsp; His play was not even declined&mdash;no
such flattering intimation was given him that it had been
read.&nbsp; What the managers would do for Mrs. Alsager concerned
him little today; the thing that was relevant was that they would
do nothing for <i>him</i>.&nbsp; That charming woman felt humbled
to the earth, so little response had she had from the powers on
which she counted.&nbsp; The two never talked about the play now,
but he tried to show her a still finer friendship, that she might
not think he felt she had failed him.&nbsp; He still walked about
London with his dreams, but as months succeeded months and he
left the year behind him they were dreams not so much of success
as of revenge.&nbsp; Success seemed a colourless name for the
reward of his patience; something fiercely florid, something
sanguinolent was more to the point.&nbsp; His best consolation
however was still in the scenic idea; it was not till now that he
discovered how incurably he was in love with it.&nbsp; By the
time a vain second year had chafed itself away he cherished his
fruitless faculty the more for the obloquy it seemed to
suffer.&nbsp; He lived, in his best hours, in a world of subjects
and situations; he wrote another play and made it as different
from its predecessor as such a very good thing could be.&nbsp; It
might be a very good thing, but when he had committed it to the
theatrical limbo indiscriminating fate took no account of the
difference.&nbsp; He was at last able to leave England for three
or four months; he went to Germany to pay a visit long deferred
to his mother and sisters.</p>
<p>Shortly before the time he had fixed for his return he
received from Mrs. Alsager a telegram consisting of the words:
&ldquo;Loder wishes see you&mdash;putting <i>Nona</i> instant
rehearsal.&rdquo;&nbsp; He spent the few hours before his
departure in kissing his mother and sisters, who knew enough
about Mrs. Alsager to judge it lucky this respectable married
lady was not there&mdash;a relief, however, accompanied with
speculative glances at London and the morrow.&nbsp; Loder, as our
young man was aware, meant the new &ldquo;Renaissance,&rdquo; but
though he reached home in the evening it was not to this
convenient modern theatre that Wayworth first proceeded.&nbsp; He
spent a late hour with Mrs. Alsager, an hour that throbbed with
calculation.&nbsp; She told him that Mr. Loder was charming, he
had simply taken up the play in its turn; he had hopes of it,
moreover, that on the part of a professional pessimist might
almost be qualified as ecstatic.&nbsp; It had been cast, with a
margin for objections, and Violet Grey was to do the
heroine.&nbsp; She had been capable, while he was away, of a good
piece of work at that foggy old playhouse the
&ldquo;Legitimate;&rdquo; the piece was a clumsy
<i>r&eacute;chauff&eacute;</i>, but she at least had been
fresh.&nbsp; Wayworth remembered Violet Grey&mdash;hadn&rsquo;t
he, for two years, on a fond policy of &ldquo;looking out,&rdquo;
kept dipping into the London theatres to pick up prospective
interpreters?&nbsp; He had not picked up many as yet, and this
young lady at all events had never wriggled in his net.&nbsp; She
was pretty and she was odd, but he had never prefigured her as
Nona Vincent, nor indeed found himself attracted by what he
already felt sufficiently launched in the profession to speak of
as her artistic personality.&nbsp; Mrs. Alsager was
different&mdash;she declared that she had been struck not a
little by some of her tones.&nbsp; The girl was interesting in
the thing at the &ldquo;Legitimate,&rdquo; and Mr. Loder, who had
his eye on her, described her as ambitious and intelligent.&nbsp;
She wanted awfully to get on&mdash;and some of those ladies were
so lazy!&nbsp; Wayworth was sceptical&mdash;he had seen Miss
Violet Grey, who was terribly itinerant, in a dozen theatres but
only in one aspect.&nbsp; Nona Vincent had a dozen aspects, but
only one theatre; yet with what a feverish curiosity the young
man promised himself to watch the actress on the morrow!&nbsp;
Talking the matter over with Mrs. Alsager now seemed the very
stuff that rehearsal was made of.&nbsp; The near prospect of
being acted laid a finger even on the lip of inquiry; he wanted
to go on tiptoe till the first night, to make no condition but
that they should speak his lines, and he felt that he
wouldn&rsquo;t so much as raise an eyebrow at the scene-painter
if he should give him an old oak chamber.</p>
<p>He became conscious, the next day, that his danger would be
other than this, and yet he couldn&rsquo;t have expressed to
himself what it would be.&nbsp; Danger was there,
doubtless&mdash;danger was everywhere, in the world of art, and
still more in the world of commerce; but what he really seemed to
catch, for the hour, was the beating of the wings of
victory.&nbsp; Nothing could undermine that, since it was victory
simply to be acted.&nbsp; It would be victory even to be acted
badly; a reflection that didn&rsquo;t prevent him, however, from
banishing, in his politic optimism, the word &ldquo;bad&rdquo;
from his vocabulary.&nbsp; It had no application, in the
compromise of practice; it didn&rsquo;t apply even to his play,
which he was conscious he had already outlived and as to which he
foresaw that, in the coming weeks, frequent alarm would
alternate, in his spirit, with frequent esteem.&nbsp; When he
went down to the dusky daylit theatre (it arched over him like
the temple of fame) Mr. Loder, who was as charming as Mrs.
Alsager had announced, struck him as the genius of
hospitality.&nbsp; The manager began to explain why, for so long,
he had given no sign; but that was the last thing that interested
Wayworth now, and he could never remember afterwards what reasons
Mr. Loder had enumerated.&nbsp; He liked, in the whole business
of discussion and preparation, even the things he had thought he
should probably dislike, and he revelled in those he had thought
he should like.&nbsp; He watched Miss Violet Grey that evening
with eyes that sought to penetrate her possibilities.&nbsp; She
certainly had a few; they were qualities of voice and face,
qualities perhaps even of intelligence; he sat there at any rate
with a fostering, coaxing attention, repeating over to himself as
convincingly as he could that she was not common&mdash;a
circumstance all the more creditable as the part she was playing
seemed to him desperately so.&nbsp; He perceived that this was
why it pleased the audience; he divined that it was the part they
enjoyed rather than the actress.&nbsp; He had a private panic,
wondering how, if they liked <i>that</i> form, they could
possibly like his.&nbsp; His form had now become quite an
ultimate idea to him.&nbsp; By the time the evening was over some
of Miss Violet Grey&rsquo;s features, several of the turns of her
head, a certain vibration of her voice, had taken their place in
the same category.&nbsp; She <i>was</i> interesting, she was
distinguished; at any rate he had accepted her: it came to the
same thing.&nbsp; But he left the theatre that night without
speaking to her&mdash;moved (a little even to his own
mystification) by an odd procrastinating impulse.&nbsp; On the
morrow he was to read his three acts to the company, and then he
should have a good deal to say; what he felt for the moment was a
vague indisposition to commit himself.&nbsp; Moreover he found a
slight confusion of annoyance in the fact that though he had been
trying all the evening to look at Nona Vincent in Violet
Grey&rsquo;s person, what subsisted in his vision was simply
Violet Grey in Nona&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t wish to see
the actress so directly, or even so simply as that; and it had
been very fatiguing, the effort to focus Nona both through the
performer and through the &ldquo;Legitimate.&rdquo;&nbsp; Before
he went to bed that night he posted three words to Mrs.
Alsager&mdash;&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not a bit like it, but I dare
say I can make her do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was pleased with the way the actress listened, the next
day, at the reading; he was pleased indeed with many things, at
the reading, and most of all with the reading itself.&nbsp; The
whole affair loomed large to him and he magnified it and mapped
it out.&nbsp; He enjoyed his occupation of the big, dim, hollow
theatre, full of the echoes of &ldquo;effect&rdquo; and of a
queer smell of gas and success&mdash;it all seemed such a passive
canvas for his picture.&nbsp; For the first time in his life he
was in command of resources; he was acquainted with the phrase,
but had never thought he should know the feeling.&nbsp; He was
surprised at what Loder appeared ready to do, though he reminded
himself that he must never show it.&nbsp; He foresaw that there
would be two distinct concomitants to the artistic effort of
producing a play, one consisting of a great deal of anguish and
the other of a great deal of amusement.&nbsp; He looked back upon
the reading, afterwards, as the best hour in the business,
because it was then that the piece had most struck him as
represented.&nbsp; What came later was the doing of others; but
this, with its imperfections and failures, was all his own.&nbsp;
The drama lived, at any rate, for that hour, with an intensity
that it was promptly to lose in the poverty and patchiness of
rehearsal; he could see its life reflected, in a way that was
sweet to him, in the stillness of the little semi-circle of
attentive and inscrutable, of water-proofed and muddy-booted,
actors.&nbsp; Miss Violet Grey was the auditor he had most to say
to, and he tried on the spot, across the shabby stage, to let her
have the soul of her part.&nbsp; Her attitude was graceful, but
though she appeared to listen with all her faculties her face
remained perfectly blank; a fact, however, not discouraging to
Wayworth, who liked her better for not being premature.&nbsp; Her
companions gave discernible signs of recognising the passages of
comedy; yet Wayworth forgave her even then for being
inexpressive.&nbsp; She evidently wished before everything else
to be simply sure of what it was all about.</p>
<p>He was more surprised even than at the revelation of the scale
on which Mr. Loder was ready to proceed by the discovery that
some of the actors didn&rsquo;t like their parts, and his heart
sank as he asked himself what he could possibly do with them if
they were going to be so stupid.&nbsp; This was the first of his
disappointments; somehow he had expected every individual to
become instantly and gratefully conscious of a rare opportunity,
and from the moment such a calculation failed he was at sea, or
mindful at any rate that more disappointments would come.&nbsp;
It was impossible to make out what the manager liked or disliked;
no judgment, no comment escaped him; his acceptance of the play
and his views about the way it should be mounted had apparently
converted him into a veiled and shrouded figure.&nbsp; Wayworth
was able to grasp the idea that they would all move now in a
higher and sharper air than that of compliment and
confidence.&nbsp; When he talked with Violet Grey after the
reading he gathered that she was really rather crude: what better
proof of it could there be than her failure to break out
instantly with an expression of delight about her great
chance?&nbsp; This reserve, however, had evidently nothing to do
with high pretensions; she had no wish to make him feel that a
person of her eminence was superior to easy raptures.&nbsp; He
guessed, after a little, that she was puzzled and even somewhat
frightened&mdash;to a certain extent she had not
understood.&nbsp; Nothing could appeal to him more than the
opportunity to clear up her difficulties, in the course of the
examination of which he quickly discovered that, so far as she
<i>had</i> understood, she had understood wrong.&nbsp; If she was
crude it was only a reason the more for talking to her; he kept
saying to her &ldquo;Ask me&mdash;ask me: ask me everything you
can think of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She asked him, she was perpetually asking him, and at the
first rehearsals, which were without form and void to a degree
that made them strike him much more as the death of an experiment
than as the dawn of a success, they threshed things out immensely
in a corner of the stage, with the effect of his coming to feel
that at any rate she was in earnest.&nbsp; He felt more and more
that his heroine was the keystone of his arch, for which indeed
the actress was very ready to take her.&nbsp; But when he
reminded this young lady of the way the whole thing practically
depended on her she was alarmed and even slightly scandalised:
she spoke more than once as if that could scarcely be the right
way to construct a play&mdash;make it stand or fall by one poor
nervous girl.&nbsp; She was almost morbidly conscientious, and in
theory he liked her for this, though he lost patience three or
four times with the things she couldn&rsquo;t do and the things
she could.&nbsp; At such times the tears came to her eyes; but
they were produced by her own stupidity, she hastened to assure
him, not by the way he spoke, which was awfully kind under the
circumstances.&nbsp; Her sincerity made her beautiful, and he
wished to heaven (and made a point of telling her so) that she
could sprinkle a little of it over Nona.&nbsp; Once, however, she
was so touched and troubled that the sight of it brought the
tears for an instant to his own eyes; and it so happened that,
turning at this moment, he found himself face to face with Mr.
Loder.&nbsp; The manager stared, glanced at the actress, who
turned in the other direction, and then smiling at Wayworth,
exclaimed, with the humour of a man who heard the gallery laugh
every night:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say&mdash;I say!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; Wayworth asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to see Miss Grey is taking such pains
with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes&mdash;she&rsquo;ll turn me out!&rdquo; said the
young man, gaily.&nbsp; He was quite aware that it was apparent
he was not superficial about Nona, and abundantly determined,
into the bargain, that the rehearsal of the piece should not
sacrifice a shade of thoroughness to any extrinsic
consideration.</p>
<p>Mrs. Alsager, whom, late in the afternoon, he used often to go
and ask for a cup of tea, thanking her in advance for the rest
she gave him and telling her how he found that rehearsal (as
<i>they</i> were doing it&mdash;it was a caution!) took it out of
one&mdash;Mrs. Alsager, more and more his good genius and, as he
repeatedly assured her, his ministering angel, confirmed him in
this superior policy and urged him on to every form of artistic
devotion.&nbsp; She had, naturally, never been more interested
than now in his work; she wanted to hear everything about
everything.&nbsp; She treated him as heroically fatigued, plied
him with luxurious restoratives, made him stretch himself on
cushions and rose-leaves.&nbsp; They gossipped more than ever, by
her fire, about the artistic life; he confided to her, for
instance, all his hopes and fears, all his experiments and
anxieties, on the subject of the representative of Nona.&nbsp;
She was immensely interested in this young lady and showed it by
taking a box again and again (she had seen her half-a-dozen times
already), to study her capacity through the veil of her present
part.&nbsp; Like Allan Wayworth she found her encouraging only by
fits, for she had fine flashes of badness.&nbsp; She was
intelligent, but she cried aloud for training, and the training
was so absent that the intelligence had only a fraction of its
effect.&nbsp; She was like a knife without an edge&mdash;good
steel that had never been sharpened; she hacked away at her hard
dramatic loaf, she couldn&rsquo;t cut it smooth.</p>
<h3>II.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Certainly</span> my leading lady
won&rsquo;t make Nona much like <i>you</i>!&rdquo; Wayworth one
day gloomily remarked to Mrs. Alsager.&nbsp; There were days when
the prospect seemed to him awful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So much the better.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no necessity
for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d train her a little&mdash;you could
so easily,&rdquo; the young man went on; in response to which
Mrs. Alsager requested him not to make such cruel fun of
her.&nbsp; But she was curious about the girl, wanted to hear of
her character, her private situation, how she lived and where,
seemed indeed desirous to befriend her.&nbsp; Wayworth might not
have known much about the private situation of Miss Violet Grey,
but, as it happened, he was able, by the time his play had been
three weeks in rehearsal, to supply information on such
points.&nbsp; She was a charming, exemplary person, educated,
cultivated, with highly modern tastes, an excellent
musician.&nbsp; She had lost her parents and was very much alone
in the world, her only two relations being a sister, who was
married to a civil servant (in a highly responsible post) in
India, and a dear little old-fashioned aunt (really a great-aunt)
with whom she lived at Notting Hill, who wrote children&rsquo;s
books and who, it appeared, had once written a Christmas
pantomime.&nbsp; It was quite an artistic home&mdash;not on the
scale of Mrs. Alsager&rsquo;s (to compare the smallest things
with the greatest!) but intensely refined and honourable.&nbsp;
Wayworth went so far as to hint that it would be rather nice and
human on Mrs. Alsager&rsquo;s part to go there&mdash;they would
take it so kindly if she should call on them.&nbsp; She had acted
so often on his hints that he had formed a pleasant habit of
expecting it: it made him feel so wisely responsible about giving
them.&nbsp; But this one appeared to fall to the ground, so that
he let the subject drop.&nbsp; Mrs. Alsager, however, went yet
once more to the &ldquo;Legitimate,&rdquo; as he found by her
saying to him abruptly, on the morrow: &ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;ll be
very good&mdash;she&rsquo;ll be very good.&rdquo;&nbsp; When they
said &ldquo;she,&rdquo; in these days, they always meant Violet
Grey, though they pretended, for the most part, that they meant
Nona Vincent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; Wayworth assented, &ldquo;she wants so
to!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Alsager was silent a moment; then she asked, a little
inconsequently, as if she had come back from a reverie:
&ldquo;Does she want to <i>very</i> much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tremendously&mdash;and it appears she has been
fascinated by the part from the first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why then didn&rsquo;t she say so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, because she&rsquo;s so funny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She <i>is</i> funny,&rdquo; said Mrs. Alsager,
musingly; and presently she added: &ldquo;She&rsquo;s in love
with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wayworth stared, blushed very red, then laughed out.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What is there funny in that?&rdquo; he demanded; but
before his interlocutress could satisfy him on this point he
inquired, further, how she knew anything about it.&nbsp; After a
little graceful evasion she explained that the night before, at
the &ldquo;Legitimate,&rdquo; Mrs. Beaumont, the wife of the
actor-manager, had paid her a visit in her box; which had
happened, in the course of their brief gossip, to lead to her
remarking that she had never been &ldquo;behind.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Mrs. Beaumont offered on the spot to take her round, and the
fancy had seized her to accept the invitation.&nbsp; She had been
amused for the moment, and in this way it befell that her
conductress, at her request, had introduced her to Miss Violet
Grey, who was waiting in the wing for one of her scenes.&nbsp;
Mrs. Beaumont had been called away for three minutes, and during
this scrap of time, face to face with the actress, she had
discovered the poor girl&rsquo;s secret.&nbsp; Wayworth qualified
it as a senseless thing, but wished to know what had led to the
discovery.&nbsp; She characterised this inquiry as superficial
for a painter of the ways of women; and he doubtless didn&rsquo;t
improve it by remarking profanely that a cat might look at a king
and that such things were convenient to know.&nbsp; Even on this
ground, however, he was threatened by Mrs. Alsager, who contended
that it might not be a joking matter to the poor girl.&nbsp; To
this Wayworth, who now professed to hate talking about the
passions he might have inspired, could only reply that he meant
it couldn&rsquo;t make a difference to Mrs. Alsager.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How in the world do you know what makes a difference to
<i>me</i>?&rdquo; this lady asked, with incongruous coldness,
with a haughtiness indeed remarkable in so gentle a spirit.</p>
<p>He saw Violet Grey that night at the theatre, and it was she
who spoke first of her having lately met a friend of his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s in love with you,&rdquo; the actress said,
after he had made a show of ignorance; &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t that
tell you anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He blushed redder still than Mrs. Alsager had made him blush,
but replied, quickly enough and very adequately, that hundreds of
women were naturally dying for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t care, for you&rsquo;re not in love
with <i>her</i>!&rdquo; the girl continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did she tell you that too?&rdquo; Wayworth asked; but
she had at that moment to go on.</p>
<p>Standing where he could see her he thought that on this
occasion she threw into her scene, which was the best she had in
the play, a brighter art than ever before, a talent that could
play with its problem.&nbsp; She was perpetually doing things out
of rehearsal (she did two or three to-night, in the other
man&rsquo;s piece), that he as often wished to heaven Nona
Vincent might have the benefit of.&nbsp; She appeared to be able
to do them for every one but him&mdash;that is for every one but
Nona.&nbsp; He was conscious, in these days, of an odd new
feeling, which mixed (this was a part of its oddity) with a very
natural and comparatively old one and which in its most definite
form was a dull ache of regret that this young lady&rsquo;s
unlucky star should have placed her on the stage.&nbsp; He wished
in his worst uneasiness that, without going further, she would
give it up; and yet it soothed that uneasiness to remind himself
that he saw grounds to hope she would go far enough to make a
marked success of Nona.&nbsp; There were strange and painful
moments when, as the interpretress of Nona, he almost hated her;
after which, however, he always assured himself that he
exaggerated, inasmuch as what made this aversion seem great, when
he was nervous, was simply its contrast with the growing sense
that there <i>were</i> grounds&mdash;totally different&mdash;on
which she pleased him.&nbsp; She pleased him as a charming
creature&mdash;by her sincerities and her perversities, by the
varieties and surprises of her character and by certain happy
facts of her person.&nbsp; In private her eyes were sad to him
and her voice was rare.&nbsp; He detested the idea that she
should have a disappointment or an humiliation, and he wanted to
rescue her altogether, to save and transplant her.&nbsp; One way
to save her was to see to it, to the best of his ability, that
the production of his play should be a triumph; and the other
way&mdash;it was really too queer to express&mdash;was almost to
wish that it shouldn&rsquo;t be.&nbsp; Then, for the future,
there would be safety and peace, and not the peace of
death&mdash;the peace of a different life.&nbsp; It is to be
added that our young man clung to the former of these ways in
proportion as the latter perversely tempted him.&nbsp; He was
nervous at the best, increasingly and intolerably nervous; but
the immediate remedy was to rehearse harder and harder, and above
all to work it out with Violet Grey.&nbsp; Some of her comrades
reproached him with working it out only with her, as if she were
the whole affair; to which he replied that they could afford to
be neglected, they were all so tremendously good.&nbsp; She was
the only person concerned whom he didn&rsquo;t flatter.</p>
<p>The author and the actress stuck so to the business in hand
that she had very little time to speak to him again of Mrs.
Alsager, of whom indeed her imagination appeared adequately to
have disposed.&nbsp; Wayworth once remarked to her that Nona
Vincent was supposed to be a good deal like his charming friend;
but she gave a blank &ldquo;Supposed by whom?&rdquo; in
consequence of which he never returned to the subject.&nbsp; He
confided his nervousness as freely as usual to Mrs. Alsager, who
easily understood that he had a peculiar complication of
anxieties.&nbsp; His suspense varied in degree from hour to hour,
but any relief there might have been in this was made up for by
its being of several different kinds.&nbsp; One afternoon, as the
first performance drew near, Mrs. Alsager said to him, in giving
him his cup of tea and on his having mentioned that he had not
closed his eyes the night before:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must indeed be in a dreadful state.&nbsp; Anxiety
for another is still worse than anxiety for one&rsquo;s
self.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For another?&rdquo; Wayworth repeated, looking at her
over the rim of his cup.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My poor friend, you&rsquo;re nervous about Nona
Vincent, but you&rsquo;re infinitely more nervous about Violet
Grey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She <i>is</i> Nona Vincent!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she isn&rsquo;t&mdash;not a bit!&rdquo; said Mrs.
Alsager, abruptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you really think so?&rdquo; Wayworth cried, spilling
his tea in his alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I think doesn&rsquo;t signify&mdash;I mean what I
think about that.&nbsp; What I meant to say was that great as is
your suspense about your play, your suspense about your actress
is greater still.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can only repeat that my actress <i>is</i> my
play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Alsager looked thoughtfully into the teapot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your actress is your&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My what?&rdquo; the young man asked, with a little
tremor in his voice, as his hostess paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your very dear friend.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re in love with
her&mdash;at present.&rdquo;&nbsp; And with a sharp click Mrs.
Alsager dropped the lid on the fragrant receptacle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet&mdash;not yet!&rdquo; laughed her visitor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will be if she pulls you through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You declare that she <i>won&rsquo;t</i> pull me
through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Alsager was silent a moment, after which she softly
murmured: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pray for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the most generous of women!&rdquo;
Wayworth cried; then coloured as if the words had not been
happy.&nbsp; They would have done indeed little honour to a man
of tact.</p>
<p>The next morning he received five hurried lines from Mrs.
Alsager.&nbsp; She had suddenly been called to Torquay, to see a
relation who was seriously ill; she should be detained there
several days, but she had an earnest hope of being able to return
in time for his first night.&nbsp; In any event he had her
unrestricted good wishes.&nbsp; He missed her extremely, for
these last days were a great strain and there was little comfort
to be derived from Violet Grey.&nbsp; She was even more nervous
than himself, and so pale and altered that he was afraid she
would be too ill to act.&nbsp; It was settled between them that
they made each other worse and that he had now much better leave
her alone.&nbsp; They had pulled Nona so to pieces that nothing
seemed left of her&mdash;she must at least have time to grow
together again.&nbsp; He left Violet Grey alone, to the best of
his ability, but she carried out imperfectly her own side of the
bargain.&nbsp; She came to him with new questions&mdash;she
waited for him with old doubts, and half an hour before the last
dress-rehearsal, on the eve of production, she proposed to him a
totally fresh rendering of his heroine.&nbsp; This incident gave
him such a sense of insecurity that he turned his back on her
without a word, bolted out of the theatre, dashed along the
Strand and walked as far as the Bank.&nbsp; Then he jumped into a
hansom and came westward, and when he reached the theatre again
the business was nearly over.&nbsp; It appeared, almost to his
disappointment, not bad enough to give him the consolation of the
old playhouse adage that the worst dress-rehearsals make the best
first nights.</p>
<p>The morrow, which was a Wednesday, was the dreadful day; the
theatre had been closed on the Monday and the Tuesday.&nbsp;
Every one, on the Wednesday, did his best to let every one else
alone, and every one signally failed in the attempt.&nbsp; The
day, till seven o&rsquo;clock, was understood to be consecrated
to rest, but every one except Violet Grey turned up at the
theatre.&nbsp; Wayworth looked at Mr. Loder, and Mr. Loder looked
in another direction, which was as near as they came to
conversation.&nbsp; Wayworth was in a fidget, unable to eat or
sleep or sit still, at times almost in terror.&nbsp; He kept
quiet by keeping, as usual, in motion; he tried to walk away from
his nervousness.&nbsp; He walked in the afternoon toward Notting
Hill, but he succeeded in not breaking the vow he had taken not
to meddle with his actress.&nbsp; She was like an acrobat poised
on a slippery ball&mdash;if he should touch her she would topple
over.&nbsp; He passed her door three times and he thought of her
three hundred.&nbsp; This was the hour at which he most regretted
that Mrs. Alsager had not come back&mdash;for he had called at
her house only to learn that she was still at Torquay.&nbsp; This
was probably queer, and it was probably queerer still that she
hadn&rsquo;t written to him; but even of these things he
wasn&rsquo;t sure, for in losing, as he had now completely lost,
his judgment of his play, he seemed to himself to have lost his
judgment of everything.&nbsp; When he went home, however, he
found a telegram from the lady of Grosvenor
Place&mdash;&ldquo;Shall be able to come&mdash;reach town by
seven.&rdquo;&nbsp; At half-past eight o&rsquo;clock, through a
little aperture in the curtain of the &ldquo;Renaissance,&rdquo;
he saw her in her box with a cluster of friends&mdash;completely
beautiful and beneficent.&nbsp; The house was
magnificent&mdash;too good for his play, he felt; too good for
any play.&nbsp; Everything now seemed too good&mdash;the scenery,
the furniture, the dresses, the very programmes.&nbsp; He seized
upon the idea that this was probably what was the matter with the
representative of Nona&mdash;she was only too good.&nbsp; He had
completely arranged with this young lady the plan of their
relations during the evening; and though they had altered
everything else that they had arranged they had promised each
other not to alter this.&nbsp; It was wonderful the number of
things they had promised each other.&nbsp; He would start her, he
would see her off&mdash;then he would quit the theatre and stay
away till just before the end.&nbsp; She besought him to stay
away&mdash;it would make her infinitely easier.&nbsp; He saw that
she was exquisitely dressed&mdash;she had made one or two changes
for the better since the night before, and that seemed something
definite to turn over and over in his mind as he rumbled foggily
home in the four-wheeler in which, a few steps from the
stage-door, he had taken refuge as soon as he knew that the
curtain was up.&nbsp; He lived a couple of miles off, and he had
chosen a four-wheeler to drag out the time.</p>
<p>When he got home his fire was out, his room was cold, and he
lay down on his sofa in his overcoat.&nbsp; He had sent his
landlady to the dress-circle, on purpose; she would overflow with
words and mistakes.&nbsp; The house seemed a black void, just as
the streets had done&mdash;every one was, formidably, at his
play.&nbsp; He was quieter at last than he had been for a
fortnight, and he felt too weak even to wonder how the thing was
going.&nbsp; He believed afterwards that he had slept an hour;
but even if he had he felt it to be still too early to return to
the theatre.&nbsp; He sat down by his lamp and tried to
read&mdash;to read a little compendious life of a great English
statesman, out of a &ldquo;series.&rdquo;&nbsp; It struck him as
brilliantly clever, and he asked himself whether that perhaps
were not rather the sort of thing he ought to have taken up: not
the statesmanship, but the art of brief biography.&nbsp; Suddenly
he became aware that he must hurry if he was to reach the theatre
at all&mdash;it was a quarter to eleven o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; He
scrambled out and, this time, found a hansom&mdash;he had lately
spent enough money in cabs to add to his hope that the profits of
his new profession would be great.&nbsp; His anxiety, his
suspense flamed up again, and as he rattled eastward&mdash;he
went fast now&mdash;he was almost sick with alternations.&nbsp;
As he passed into the theatre the first man&mdash;some
underling&mdash;who met him, cried to him, breathlessly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re wanted, sir&mdash;you&rsquo;re
wanted!&rdquo;&nbsp; He thought his tone very ominous&mdash;he
devoured the man&rsquo;s eyes with his own, for a betrayal: did
he mean that he was wanted for execution?&nbsp; Some one else
pressed him, almost pushed him, forward; he was already on the
stage.&nbsp; Then he became conscious of a sound more or less
continuous, but seemingly faint and far, which he took at first
for the voice of the actors heard through their canvas walls, the
beautiful built-in room of the last act.&nbsp; But the actors
were in the wing, they surrounded him; the curtain was down and
they were coming off from before it.&nbsp; They had been called,
and <i>he</i> was called&mdash;they all greeted him with
&ldquo;Go on&mdash;go on!&rdquo;&nbsp; He was terrified&mdash;he
couldn&rsquo;t go on&mdash;he didn&rsquo;t believe in the
applause, which seemed to him only audible enough to sound
half-hearted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has it gone?&mdash;<i>has</i> it gone?&rdquo; he gasped
to the people round him; and he heard them say
&ldquo;Rather&mdash;rather!&rdquo; perfunctorily, mendaciously
too, as it struck him, and even with mocking laughter, the
laughter of defeat and despair.&nbsp; Suddenly, though all this
must have taken but a moment, Loder burst upon him from somewhere
with a &ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake don&rsquo;t keep them, or
they&rsquo;ll <i>stop</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t
go on for <i>that</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; Wayworth cried, in anguish;
the sound seemed to him already to have ceased.&nbsp; Loder had
hold of him and was shoving him; he resisted and looked round
frantically for Violet Grey, who perhaps would tell him the
truth.&nbsp; There was by this time a crowd in the wing, all with
strange grimacing painted faces, but Violet was not among them
and her very absence frightened him.&nbsp; He uttered her name
with an accent that he afterwards regretted&mdash;it gave them,
as he thought, both away; and while Loder hustled him before the
curtain he heard some one say &ldquo;She took her call and
disappeared.&rdquo;&nbsp; She had had a call, then&mdash;this was
what was most present to the young man as he stood for an instant
in the glare of the footlights, looking blindly at the great
vaguely-peopled horseshoe and greeted with plaudits which now
seemed to him at once louder than he deserved and feebler than he
desired.&nbsp; They sank to rest quickly, but he felt it to be
long before he could back away, before he could, in his turn,
seize the manager by the arm and cry huskily&mdash;&ldquo;Has it
really gone&mdash;<i>really</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Loder looked at him hard and replied after an instant:
&ldquo;The play&rsquo;s all right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wayworth hung upon his lips.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then what&rsquo;s
all wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must do something to Miss Grey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She isn&rsquo;t <i>in</i> it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean she has failed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, damn it&mdash;she has failed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wayworth stared.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then how can the play be all
right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll save it&mdash;we&rsquo;ll save
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Miss Grey&mdash;where <i>is</i>
she?&rdquo; the young man asked.</p>
<p>Loder caught his arm as he was turning away again to look for
his heroine.&nbsp; &ldquo;Never mind her now&mdash;she knows
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wayworth was approached at the same moment by a gentleman he
knew as one of Mrs. Alsager&rsquo;s friends&mdash;he had
perceived him in that lady&rsquo;s box.&nbsp; Mrs. Alsager was
waiting there for the successful author; she desired very
earnestly that he would come round and speak to her.&nbsp;
Wayworth assured himself first that Violet had left the
theatre&mdash;one of the actresses could tell him that she had
seen her throw on a cloak, without changing her dress, and had
learnt afterwards that she had, the next moment, flung herself,
after flinging her aunt, into a cab.&nbsp; He had wished to
invite half a dozen persons, of whom Miss Grey and her elderly
relative were two, to come home to supper with him; but she had
refused to make any engagement beforehand (it would be so
dreadful to have to keep it if she shouldn&rsquo;t have made a
hit), and this attitude had blighted the pleasant plan, which
fell to the ground.&nbsp; He had called her morbid, but she was
immovable.&nbsp; Mrs. Alsager&rsquo;s messenger let him know that
he was expected to supper in Grosvenor Place, and half an hour
afterwards he was seated there among complimentary people and
flowers and popping corks, eating the first orderly meal he had
partaken of for a week.&nbsp; Mrs. Alsager had carried him off in
her brougham&mdash;the other people who were coming got into
things of their own.&nbsp; He stopped her short as soon as she
began to tell him how tremendously every one had been struck by
the piece; he nailed her down to the question of Violet
Grey.&nbsp; Had she spoilt the play, had she jeopardised or
compromised it&mdash;had she been utterly bad, had she been good
in any degree?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly the performance would have seemed better if
<i>she</i> had been better,&rdquo; Mrs. Alsager confessed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the play would have seemed better if the
performance had been better,&rdquo; Wayworth said, gloomily, from
the corner of the brougham.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She does what she can, and she has talent, and she
looked lovely.&nbsp; But she doesn&rsquo;t <i>see</i> Nona
Vincent.&nbsp; She doesn&rsquo;t see the type&mdash;she
doesn&rsquo;t see the individual&mdash;she doesn&rsquo;t see the
woman you meant.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s out of it&mdash;she gives you
a different person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the woman I meant!&rdquo; the young man exclaimed,
looking at the London lamps as he rolled by them.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
wish to God she had known <i>you</i>!&rdquo; he added, as the
carriage stopped.&nbsp; After they had passed into the house he
said to his companion:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see she <i>won&rsquo;t</i> pull me
through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgive her&mdash;be kind to her!&rdquo; Mrs. Alsager
pleaded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall only thank her.&nbsp; The play may go to the
dogs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it does&mdash;if it does,&rdquo; Mrs. Alsager began,
with her pure eyes on him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what if it does?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She couldn&rsquo;t tell him, for the rest of her guests came
in together; she only had time to say: &ldquo;It
<i>sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t</i> go to the dogs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He came away before the others, restless with the desire to go
to Notting Hill even that night, late as it was, haunted with the
sense that Violet Grey had measured her fall.&nbsp; When he got
into the street, however, he allowed second thoughts to counsel
another course; the effect of knocking her up at two
o&rsquo;clock in the morning would hardly be to soothe her.&nbsp;
He looked at six newspapers the next day and found in them never
a good word for her.&nbsp; They were well enough about the piece,
but they were unanimous as to the disappointment caused by the
young actress whose former efforts had excited such hopes and on
whom, on this occasion, such pressing responsibilities
rested.&nbsp; They asked in chorus what was the matter with her,
and they declared in chorus that the play, which was not without
promise, was handicapped (they all used the same word) by the odd
want of correspondence between the heroine and her
interpreter.&nbsp; Wayworth drove early to Notting Hill, but he
didn&rsquo;t take the newspapers with him; Violet Grey could be
trusted to have sent out for them by the peep of dawn and to have
fed her anguish full.&nbsp; She declined to see him&mdash;she
only sent down word by her aunt that she was extremely unwell and
should be unable to act that night unless she were suffered to
spend the day unmolested and in bed.&nbsp; Wayworth sat for an
hour with the old lady, who understood everything and to whom he
could speak frankly.&nbsp; She gave him a touching picture of her
niece&rsquo;s condition, which was all the more vivid for the
simple words in which it was expressed: &ldquo;She feels she
isn&rsquo;t right, you know&mdash;she feels she isn&rsquo;t
right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell her it doesn&rsquo;t matter&mdash;it doesn&rsquo;t
matter a straw!&rdquo; said Wayworth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And she&rsquo;s so proud&mdash;you know how proud she
is!&rdquo; the old lady went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell her I&rsquo;m more than satisfied, that I accept
her gratefully as she is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She says she injures your play, that she ruins
it,&rdquo; said his interlocutress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll improve, immensely&mdash;she&rsquo;ll grow
into the part,&rdquo; the young man continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;d improve if she knew how&mdash;but she says
she doesn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; She has given all she has got, and she
doesn&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s wanted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wanted is simply that she should go
straight on and trust me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can she trust you when she feels she&rsquo;s losing
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Losing me?&rdquo; Wayworth cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never forgive her if your play is taken
off!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will run six months,&rdquo; said the author of the
piece.</p>
<p>The old lady laid her hand on his arm.&nbsp; &ldquo;What will
you do for her if it does?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at Violet Grey&rsquo;s aunt a moment.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Do you say your niece is very proud?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too proud for her dreadful profession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then she wouldn&rsquo;t wish you to ask me that,&rdquo;
Wayworth answered, getting up.</p>
<p>When he reached home he was very tired, and for a person to
whom it was open to consider that he had scored a success he
spent a remarkably dismal day.&nbsp; All his restlessness had
gone, and fatigue and depression possessed him.&nbsp; He sank
into his old chair by the fire and sat there for hours with his
eyes closed.&nbsp; His landlady came in to bring his luncheon and
mend the fire, but he feigned to be asleep, so as not to be
spoken to.&nbsp; It is to be supposed that sleep at last overtook
him, for about the hour that dusk began to gather he had an
extraordinary impression, a visit that, it would seem, could have
belonged to no waking consciousness.&nbsp; Nona Vincent, in face
and form, the living heroine of his play, rose before him in his
little silent room, sat down with him at his dingy
fireside.&nbsp; She was not Violet Grey, she was not Mrs.
Alsager, she was not any woman he had seen upon earth, nor was it
any masquerade of friendship or of penitence.&nbsp; Yet she was
more familiar to him than the women he had known best, and she
was ineffably beautiful and consoling.&nbsp; She filled the poor
room with her presence, the effect of which was as soothing as
some odour of incense.&nbsp; She was as quiet as an affectionate
sister, and there was no surprise in her being there.&nbsp;
Nothing more real had ever befallen him, and nothing, somehow,
more reassuring.&nbsp; He felt her hand rest upon his own, and
all his senses seemed to open to her message.&nbsp; She struck
him, in the strangest way, both as his creation and as his
inspirer, and she gave him the happiest consciousness of
success.&nbsp; If she was so charming, in the red firelight, in
her vague, clear-coloured garments, it was because he had made
her so, and yet if the weight seemed lifted from his spirit it
was because she drew it away.&nbsp; When she bent her deep eyes
upon him they seemed to speak of safety and freedom and to make a
green garden of the future.&nbsp; From time to time she smiled
and said: &ldquo;I live&mdash;I live&mdash;I live.&rdquo;&nbsp;
How long she stayed he couldn&rsquo;t have told, but when his
landlady blundered in with the lamp Nona Vincent was no longer
there.&nbsp; He rubbed his eyes, but no dream had ever been so
intense; and as he slowly got out of his chair it was with a deep
still joy&mdash;the joy of the artist&mdash;in the thought of how
right he had been, how exactly like herself he had made
her.&nbsp; She had come to show him that.&nbsp; At the end of
five minutes, however, he felt sufficiently mystified to call his
landlady back&mdash;he wanted to ask her a question.&nbsp; When
the good woman reappeared the question hung fire an instant; then
it shaped itself as the inquiry:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has any lady been here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir&mdash;no lady at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman seemed slightly scandalised.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not Miss
Vincent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Vincent, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The young lady of my play, don&rsquo;t you
know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sir, you mean Miss Violet Grey!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No I don&rsquo;t, at all.&nbsp; I think I mean Mrs.
Alsager.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There has been no Mrs. Alsager, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor anybody at all like her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman looked at him as if she wondered what had suddenly
taken him.&nbsp; Then she asked in an injured tone: &ldquo;Why
shouldn&rsquo;t I have told you if you&rsquo;d &rsquo;ad callers,
sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you might have thought I was
asleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed you were, sir, when I came in with the
lamp&mdash;and well you&rsquo;d earned it, Mr.
Wayworth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The landlady came back an hour later to bring him a telegram;
it was just as he had begun to dress to dine at his club and go
down to the theatre.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See me to-night in front, and don&rsquo;t come near me
till it&rsquo;s over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was in these words that Violet communicated her wishes for
the evening.&nbsp; He obeyed them to the letter; he watched her
from the depths of a box.&nbsp; He was in no position to say how
she might have struck him the night before, but what he saw
during these charmed hours filled him with admiration and
gratitude.&nbsp; She <i>was</i> in it, this time; she had pulled
herself together, she had taken possession, she was felicitous at
every turn.&nbsp; Fresh from his revelation of Nona he was in a
position to judge, and as he judged he exulted.&nbsp; He was
thrilled and carried away, and he was moreover intensely curious
to know what had happened to her, by what unfathomable art she
had managed in a few hours to effect such a change of base.&nbsp;
It was as if <i>she</i> had had a revelation of Nona, so
convincing a clearness had been breathed upon the picture.&nbsp;
He kept himself quiet in the <i>entr&rsquo;actes</i>&mdash;he
would speak to her only at the end; but before the play was half
over the manager burst into his box.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s prodigious, what she&rsquo;s up to!&rdquo;
cried Mr. Loder, almost more bewildered than gratified.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She has gone in for a new reading&mdash;a blessed
somersault in the air!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it quite different?&rdquo; Wayworth asked, sharing
his mystification.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Different?&nbsp; Hyperion to a satyr!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
devilish good, my boy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s devilish good,&rdquo; said Wayworth,
&ldquo;and it&rsquo;s in a different key altogether from the key
of her rehearsal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll run you six months!&rdquo; the manager
declared; and he rushed round again to the actress, leaving
Wayworth with a sense that she had already pulled him
through.&nbsp; She had with the audience an immense personal
success.</p>
<p>When he went behind, at the end, he had to wait for her; she
only showed herself when she was ready to leave the
theatre.&nbsp; Her aunt had been in her dressing-room with her,
and the two ladies appeared together.&nbsp; The girl passed him
quickly, motioning him to say nothing till they should have got
out of the place.&nbsp; He saw that she was immensely excited,
lifted altogether above her common artistic level.&nbsp; The old
lady said to him: &ldquo;You must come home to supper with us: it
has been all arranged.&rdquo;&nbsp; They had a brougham, with a
little third seat, and he got into it with them.&nbsp; It was a
long time before the actress would speak.&nbsp; She leaned back
in her corner, giving no sign but still heaving a little, like a
subsiding sea, and with all her triumph in the eyes that shone
through the darkness.&nbsp; The old lady was hushed to awe, or at
least to discretion, and Wayworth was happy enough to wait.&nbsp;
He had really to wait till they had alighted at Notting Hill,
where the elder of his companions went to see that supper had
been attended to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was better&mdash;I was better,&rdquo; said Violet
Grey, throwing off her cloak in the little drawing-room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were perfection.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll be like that
every night, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She smiled at him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Every night?&nbsp; There can
scarcely be a miracle every day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by a miracle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had a revelation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wayward stared.&nbsp; &ldquo;At what hour?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The right hour&mdash;this afternoon.&nbsp; Just in time
to save me&mdash;and to save <i>you</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At five o&rsquo;clock?&nbsp; Do you mean you had a
visit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She came to me&mdash;she stayed two hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two hours?&nbsp; Nona Vincent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Alsager.&rdquo;&nbsp; Violet Grey smiled more
deeply.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the same thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how did Mrs. Alsager save you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By letting me look at her.&nbsp; By letting me hear her
speak.&nbsp; By letting me know her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what did she say to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kind things&mdash;encouraging, intelligent
things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, the dear woman!&rdquo; Wayworth cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to like her&mdash;she likes <i>you</i>.&nbsp;
She was just what I wanted,&rdquo; the actress added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean she talked to you about Nona?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She said you thought she was like her.&nbsp; She
<i>is</i>&mdash;she&rsquo;s exquisite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s exquisite,&rdquo; Wayworth repeated.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Do you mean she tried to coach you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no&mdash;she only said she would be so glad if it
would help me to see her.&nbsp; And I felt it did help me.&nbsp;
I don&rsquo;t know what took place&mdash;she only sat there, and
she held my hand and smiled at me, and she had tact and grace,
and she had goodness and beauty, and she soothed my nerves and
lighted up my imagination.&nbsp; Somehow she seemed to
<i>give</i> it all to me.&nbsp; I took it&mdash;I took it.&nbsp;
I kept her before me, I drank her in.&nbsp; For the first time,
in the whole study of the part, I had my model&mdash;I could make
my copy.&nbsp; All my courage came back to me, and other things
came that I hadn&rsquo;t felt before.&nbsp; She was
different&mdash;she was delightful; as I&rsquo;ve said, she was a
revelation.&nbsp; She kissed me when she went away&mdash;and you
may guess if I kissed <i>her</i>.&nbsp; We were awfully
affectionate, but it&rsquo;s <i>you</i> she likes!&rdquo; said
Violet Grey.</p>
<p>Wayworth had never been more interested in his life, and he
had rarely been more mystified.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did she wear vague,
clear-coloured garments?&rdquo; he asked, after a moment.</p>
<p>Violet Grey stared, laughed, then bade him go in to
supper.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>You</i> know how she dresses!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was very well pleased at supper, but he was silent and a
little solemn.&nbsp; He said he would go to see Mrs. Alsager the
next day.&nbsp; He did so, but he was told at her door that she
had returned to Torquay.&nbsp; She remained there all winter, all
spring, and the next time he saw her his play had run two hundred
nights and he had married Violet Grey.&nbsp; His plays sometimes
succeed, but his wife is not in them now, nor in any
others.&nbsp; At these representations Mrs. Alsager continues
frequently to be present.</p>
<h2><a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>THE
CHAPERON.</h2>
<h3>I.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">An</span> old lady, in a high
drawing-room, had had her chair moved close to the fire, where
she sat knitting and warming her knees.&nbsp; She was dressed in
deep mourning; her face had a faded nobleness, tempered, however,
by the somewhat illiberal compression assumed by her lips in
obedience to something that was passing in her mind.&nbsp; She
was far from the lamp, but though her eyes were fixed upon her
active needles she was not looking at them.&nbsp; What she really
saw was quite another train of affairs.&nbsp; The room was
spacious and dim; the thick London fog had oozed into it even
through its superior defences.&nbsp; It was full of dusky,
massive, valuable things.&nbsp; The old lady sat motionless save
for the regularity of her clicking needles, which seemed as
personal to her and as expressive as prolonged fingers.&nbsp; If
she was thinking something out, she was thinking it
thoroughly.</p>
<p>When she looked up, on the entrance of a girl of twenty, it
might have been guessed that the appearance of this young lady
was not an interruption of her meditation, but rather a
contribution to it.&nbsp; The young lady, who was charming to
behold, was also in deep mourning, which had a freshness, if
mourning can be fresh, an air of having been lately put on.&nbsp;
She went straight to the bell beside the chimney-piece and pulled
it, while in her other hand she held a sealed and directed
letter.&nbsp; Her companion glanced in silence at the letter;
then she looked still harder at her work.&nbsp; The girl hovered
near the fireplace, without speaking, and after a due, a
dignified interval the butler appeared in response to the
bell.&nbsp; The time had been sufficient to make the silence
between the ladies seem long.&nbsp; The younger one asked the
butler to see that her letter should be posted; and after he had
gone out she moved vaguely about the room, as if to give her
grandmother&mdash;for such was the elder personage&mdash;a chance
to begin a colloquy of which she herself preferred not to strike
the first note.&nbsp; As equally with herself her companion was
on the face of it capable of holding out, the tension, though it
was already late in the evening, might have lasted long.&nbsp;
But the old lady after a little appeared to recognise, a trifle
ungraciously, the girl&rsquo;s superior resources.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you written to your mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but only a few lines, to tell her I shall come and
see her in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that all you&rsquo;ve got to say?&rdquo; asked the
grandmother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite know what you want me to
say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to say that you&rsquo;ve made up your
mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve done that, granny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You intend to respect your father&rsquo;s
wishes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It depends upon what you mean by respecting them.&nbsp;
I do justice to the feelings by which they were
dictated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by justice?&rdquo; the old lady
retorted.</p>
<p>The girl was silent a moment; then she said:
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see my idea of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see it already!&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll go and live with
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall talk the situation over with her to-morrow and
tell her that I think that will be best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Best for her, no doubt!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s best for her is best for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And for your brother and sister?&rdquo;&nbsp; As the
girl made no reply to this her grandmother went on:
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s best for them is that you should acknowledge
some responsibility in regard to them and, considering how young
they are, try and do something for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They must do as I&rsquo;ve done&mdash;they must act for
themselves.&nbsp; They have their means now, and they&rsquo;re
free.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Free?&nbsp; They&rsquo;re mere children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me remind you that Eric is older than I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t like his mother,&rdquo; said the old
lady, as if that were an answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never said he did.&nbsp; And she adores
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, your mother&rsquo;s adorations!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t abuse her now,&rdquo; the girl rejoined,
after a pause.</p>
<p>The old lady forbore to abuse her, but she made up for it the
next moment by saying: &ldquo;It will be dreadful for
Edith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will be dreadful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your desertion of her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The desertion&rsquo;s on her side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her consideration for her father does her
honour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;m a brute, <i>n&rsquo;en parlons
plus</i>,&rdquo; said the girl.&nbsp; &ldquo;We must go our
respective ways,&rdquo; she added, in a tone of extreme wisdom
and philosophy.</p>
<p>Her grandmother straightened out her knitting and began to
roll it up.&nbsp; &ldquo;Be so good as to ring for my
maid,&rdquo; she said, after a minute.&nbsp; The young lady rang,
and there was another wait and another conscious hush.&nbsp;
Before the maid came her mistress remarked: &ldquo;Of course then
you&rsquo;ll not come to <i>me</i>, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by &lsquo;coming&rsquo; to
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t receive you on that footing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll not come <i>with</i> me, if you mean
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean that,&rdquo; said the old lady,
getting up as her maid came in.&nbsp; This attendant took her
work from her, gave her an arm and helped her out of the room,
while Rose Tramore, standing before the fire and looking into it,
faced the idea that her grandmother&rsquo;s door would now under
all circumstances be closed to her.&nbsp; She lost no time
however in brooding over this anomaly: it only added energy to
her determination to act.&nbsp; All she could do to-night was to
go to bed, for she felt utterly weary.&nbsp; She had been living,
in imagination, in a prospective struggle, and it had left her as
exhausted as a real fight.&nbsp; Moreover this was the
culmination of a crisis, of weeks of suspense, of a long, hard
strain.&nbsp; Her father had been laid in his grave five days
before, and that morning his will had been read.&nbsp; In the
afternoon she had got Edith off to St. Leonard&rsquo;s with their
aunt Julia, and then she had had a wretched talk with Eric.&nbsp;
Lastly, she had made up her mind to act in opposition to the
formidable will, to a clause which embodied if not exactly a
provision, a recommendation singularly emphatic.&nbsp; She went
to bed and slept the sleep of the just.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my dear, how charming!&nbsp; I must take another
house!&rdquo;&nbsp; It was in these words that her mother
responded to the announcement Rose had just formally made and
with which she had vaguely expected to produce a certain dignity
of effect.&nbsp; In the way of emotion there was apparently no
effect at all, and the girl was wise enough to know that this was
not simply on account of the general line of non-allusion taken
by the extremely pretty woman before her, who looked like her
elder sister.&nbsp; Mrs. Tramore had never manifested, to her
daughter, the slightest consciousness that her position was
peculiar; but the recollection of something more than that fine
policy was required to explain such a failure, to appreciate
Rose&rsquo;s sacrifice.&nbsp; It was simply a fresh reminder that
she had never appreciated anything, that she was nothing but a
tinted and stippled surface.&nbsp; Her situation was peculiar
indeed.&nbsp; She had been the heroine of a scandal which had
grown dim only because, in the eyes of the London world, it paled
in the lurid light of the contemporaneous.&nbsp; That attention
had been fixed on it for several days, fifteen years before;
there had been a high relish of the vivid evidence as to his
wife&rsquo;s misconduct with which, in the divorce-court, Charles
Tramore had judged well to regale a cynical public.&nbsp; The
case was pronounced awfully bad, and he obtained his
decree.&nbsp; The folly of the wife had been inconceivable, in
spite of other examples: she had quitted her children, she had
followed the &ldquo;other fellow&rdquo; abroad.&nbsp; The other
fellow hadn&rsquo;t married her, not having had time: he had lost
his life in the Mediterranean by the capsizing of a boat, before
the prohibitory term had expired.</p>
<p>Mrs. Tramore had striven to extract from this accident
something of the austerity of widowhood; but her mourning only
made her deviation more public, she was a widow whose husband was
awkwardly alive.&nbsp; She had not prowled about the Continent on
the classic lines; she had come back to London to take her
chance.&nbsp; But London would give her no chance, would have
nothing to say to her; as many persons had remarked, you could
never tell how London would behave.&nbsp; It would not receive
Mrs. Tramore again on any terms, and when she was spoken of,
which now was not often, it was inveterately said of her that she
went nowhere.&nbsp; Apparently she had not the qualities for
which London compounds; though in the cases in which it does
compound you may often wonder what these qualities are.&nbsp; She
had not at any rate been successful: her lover was dead, her
husband was liked and her children were pitied, for in payment
for a topic London will parenthetically pity.&nbsp; It was
thought interesting and magnanimous that Charles Tramore had not
married again.&nbsp; The disadvantage to his children of the
miserable story was thus left uncorrected, and this, rather
oddly, was counted as <i>his</i> sacrifice.&nbsp; His mother,
whose arrangements were elaborate, looked after them a great
deal, and they enjoyed a mixture of laxity and discipline under
the roof of their aunt, Miss Tramore, who was independent,
having, for reasons that the two ladies had exhaustively
discussed, determined to lead her own life.&nbsp; She had set up
a home at St. Leonard&rsquo;s, and that contracted shore had
played a considerable part in the upbringing of the little
Tramores.&nbsp; They knew about their mother, as the phrase was,
but they didn&rsquo;t know her; which was naturally deemed more
pathetic for them than for her.&nbsp; She had a house in Chester
Square and an income and a victoria&mdash;it served all purposes,
as she never went out in the evening&mdash;and flowers on her
window-sills, and a remarkable appearance of youth.&nbsp; The
income was supposed to be in part the result of a bequest from
the man for whose sake she had committed the error of her life,
and in the appearance of youth there was a slightly impertinent
implication that it was a sort of afterglow of the same
connection.</p>
<p>Her children, as they grew older, fortunately showed signs of
some individuality of disposition.&nbsp; Edith, the second girl,
clung to her aunt Julia; Eric, the son, clung frantically to
polo; while Rose, the elder daughter, appeared to cling mainly to
herself.&nbsp; Collectively, of course, they clung to their
father, whose attitude in the family group, however, was casual
and intermittent.&nbsp; He was charming and vague; he was like a
clever actor who often didn&rsquo;t come to rehearsal.&nbsp;
Fortune, which but for that one stroke had been generous to him,
had provided him with deputies and trouble-takers, as well as
with whimsical opinions, and a reputation for excellent taste,
and whist at his club, and perpetual cigars on morocco sofas, and
a beautiful absence of purpose.&nbsp; Nature had thrown in a
remarkably fine hand, which he sometimes passed over his
children&rsquo;s heads when they were glossy from the nursery
brush.&nbsp; On Rose&rsquo;s eighteenth birthday he said to her
that she might go to see her mother, on condition that her visits
should be limited to an hour each time and to four in the
year.&nbsp; She was to go alone; the other children were not
included in the arrangement.&nbsp; This was the result of a visit
that he himself had paid his repudiated wife at her urgent
request, their only encounter during the fifteen years.&nbsp; The
girl knew as much as this from her aunt Julia, who was full of
tell-tale secrecies.&nbsp; She availed herself eagerly of the
license, and in course of the period that elapsed before her
father&rsquo;s death she spent with Mrs. Tramore exactly eight
hours by the watch.&nbsp; Her father, who was as inconsistent and
disappointing as he was amiable, spoke to her of her mother only
once afterwards.&nbsp; This occasion had been the sequel of her
first visit, and he had made no use of it to ask what she thought
of the personality in Chester Square or how she liked it.&nbsp;
He had only said &ldquo;Did she take you out?&rdquo; and when
Rose answered &ldquo;Yes, she put me straight into a carriage and
drove me up and down Bond Street,&rdquo; had rejoined sharply
&ldquo;See that that never occurs again.&rdquo;&nbsp; It never
did, but once was enough, every one they knew having happened to
be in Bond Street at that particular hour.</p>
<p>After this the periodical interview took place in private, in
Mrs. Tramore&rsquo;s beautiful little wasted drawing-room.&nbsp;
Rose knew that, rare as these occasions were, her mother would
not have kept her &ldquo;all to herself&rdquo; had there been
anybody she could have shown her to.&nbsp; But in the poor
lady&rsquo;s social void there was no one; she had after all her
own correctness and she consistently preferred isolation to
inferior contacts.&nbsp; So her daughter was subjected only to
the maternal; it was not necessary to be definite in qualifying
that.&nbsp; The girl had by this time a collection of ideas,
gathered by impenetrable processes; she had tasted, in the
ostracism of her ambiguous parent, of the acrid fruit of the tree
of knowledge.&nbsp; She not only had an approximate vision of
what every one had done, but she had a private judgment for each
case.&nbsp; She had a particular vision of her father, which did
not interfere with his being dear to her, but which was directly
concerned in her resolution, after his death, to do the special
thing he had expressed the wish she should not do.&nbsp; In the
general estimate her grandmother and her grandmother&rsquo;s
money had their place, and the strong probability that any
enjoyment of the latter commodity would now be withheld from
her.&nbsp; It included Edith&rsquo;s marked inclination to
receive the law, and doubtless eventually a more substantial
memento, from Miss Tramore, and opened the question whether her
own course might not contribute to make her sister&rsquo;s appear
heartless.&nbsp; The answer to this question however would depend
on the success that might attend her own, which would very
possibly be small.&nbsp; Eric&rsquo;s attitude was eminently
simple; he didn&rsquo;t care to know people who didn&rsquo;t know
<i>his</i> people.&nbsp; If his mother should ever get back into
society perhaps he would take her up.&nbsp; Rose Tramore had
decided to do what she could to bring this consummation about;
and strangely enough&mdash;so mixed were her superstitions and
her heresies&mdash;a large part of her motive lay in the value
she attached to such a consecration.</p>
<p>Of her mother intrinsically she thought very little now, and
if her eyes were fixed on a special achievement it was much more
for the sake of that achievement and to satisfy a latent energy
that was in her than because her heart was wrung by this
sufferer.&nbsp; Her heart had not been wrung at all, though she
had quite held it out for the experience.&nbsp; Her purpose was a
pious game, but it was still essentially a game.&nbsp; Among the
ideas I have mentioned she had her idea of triumph.&nbsp; She had
caught the inevitable note, the pitch, on her very first visit to
Chester Square.&nbsp; She had arrived there in intense
excitement, and her excitement was left on her hands in a manner
that reminded her of a difficult air she had once heard sung at
the opera when no one applauded the performer.&nbsp; That
flatness had made her sick, and so did this, in another
way.&nbsp; A part of her agitation proceeded from the fact that
her aunt Julia had told her, in the manner of a burst of
confidence, something she was not to repeat, that she was in
appearance the very image of the lady in Chester Square.&nbsp;
The motive that prompted this declaration was between aunt Julia
and her conscience; but it was a great emotion to the girl to
find her entertainer so beautiful.&nbsp; She was tall and
exquisitely slim; she had hair more exactly to Rose
Tramore&rsquo;s taste than any other she had ever seen, even to
every detail in the way it was dressed, and a complexion and a
figure of the kind that are always spoken of as
&ldquo;lovely.&rdquo;&nbsp; Her eyes were irresistible, and so
were her clothes, though the clothes were perhaps a little more
precisely the right thing than the eyes.&nbsp; Her appearance was
marked to her daughter&rsquo;s sense by the highest distinction;
though it may be mentioned that this had never been the opinion
of all the world.&nbsp; It was a revelation to Rose that she
herself might look a little like that.&nbsp; She knew however
that aunt Julia had not seen her deposed sister-in-law for a long
time, and she had a general impression that Mrs. Tramore was
to-day a more complete production&mdash;for instance as regarded
her air of youth&mdash;than she had ever been.&nbsp; There was no
excitement on her side&mdash;that was all her visitor&rsquo;s;
there was no emotion&mdash;that was excluded by the plan, to say
nothing of conditions more primal.&nbsp; Rose had from the first
a glimpse of her mother&rsquo;s plan.&nbsp; It was to mention
nothing and imply nothing, neither to acknowledge, to explain nor
to extenuate.&nbsp; She would leave everything to her child; with
her child she was secure.&nbsp; She only wanted to get back into
society; she would leave even that to her child, whom she treated
not as a high-strung and heroic daughter, a creature of
exaltation, of devotion, but as a new, charming, clever, useful
friend, a little younger than herself.&nbsp; Already on that
first day she had talked about dressmakers.&nbsp; Of course, poor
thing, it was to be remembered that in her circumstances there
were not many things she <i>could</i> talk about.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She wants to go out again; that&rsquo;s the only thing in
the wide world she wants,&rdquo; Rose had promptly, compendiously
said to herself.&nbsp; There had been a sequel to this
observation, uttered, in intense engrossment, in her own room
half an hour before she had, on the important evening, made known
her decision to her grandmother: &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll
<i>take</i> her out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll drag you down, she&rsquo;ll drag you
down!&rdquo; Julia Tramore permitted herself to remark to her
niece, the next day, in a tone of feverish prophecy.</p>
<p>As the girl&rsquo;s own theory was that all the dragging there
might be would be upward, and moreover administered by herself,
she could look at her aunt with a cold and inscrutable eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then, I shall be out of your sight, from the
pinnacle you occupy, and I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t trouble
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you reproach me for my disinterested exertions, for
the way I&rsquo;ve toiled over you, the way I&rsquo;ve lived for
you?&rdquo; Miss Tramore demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t reproach <i>me</i> for being kind to my
mother and I won&rsquo;t reproach you for anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll keep you out of
everything&mdash;she&rsquo;ll make you miss everything,&rdquo;
Miss Tramore continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then she&rsquo;ll make me miss a great deal
that&rsquo;s odious,&rdquo; said the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re too young for such extravagances,&rdquo;
her aunt declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet Edith, who is younger than I, seems to be too
old for them: how do you arrange that?&nbsp; My mother&rsquo;s
society will make me older,&rdquo; Rose replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak to me of your mother; you <i>have</i>
no mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then if I&rsquo;m an orphan I must settle things for
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you justify her, do you approve of her?&rdquo; cried
Miss Tramore, who was inferior to her niece in capacity for
retort and whose limitations made the girl appear pert.</p>
<p>Rose looked at her a moment in silence; then she said, turning
away: &ldquo;I think she&rsquo;s charming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you propose to become charming in the same
manner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her manner is perfect; it would be an excellent
model.&nbsp; But I can&rsquo;t discuss my mother with
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to discuss her with some other
people!&rdquo; Miss Tramore proclaimed, going out of the
room.</p>
<p>Rose wondered whether this were a general or a particular
vaticination.&nbsp; There was something her aunt might have meant
by it, but her aunt rarely meant the best thing she might have
meant.&nbsp; Miss Tramore had come up from St. Leonard&rsquo;s in
response to a telegram from her own parent, for an occasion like
the present brought with it, for a few hours, a certain
relaxation of their dissent.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do what you can to stop
her,&rdquo; the old lady had said; but her daughter found that
the most she could do was not much.&nbsp; They both had a baffled
sense that Rose had thought the question out a good deal further
than they; and this was particularly irritating to Mrs. Tramore,
as consciously the cleverer of the two.&nbsp; A question thought
out as far as <i>she</i> could think it had always appeared to
her to have performed its human uses; she had never encountered a
ghost emerging from that extinction.&nbsp; Their great contention
was that Rose would cut herself off; and certainly if she
wasn&rsquo;t afraid of that she wasn&rsquo;t afraid of
anything.&nbsp; Julia Tramore could only tell her mother how
little the girl was afraid.&nbsp; She was already prepared to
leave the house, taking with her the possessions, or her share of
them, that had accumulated there during her father&rsquo;s
illness.&nbsp; There had been a going and coming of her maid, a
thumping about of boxes, an ordering of four-wheelers; it
appeared to old Mrs. Tramore that something of the
objectionableness, the indecency, of her granddaughter&rsquo;s
prospective connection had already gathered about the
place.&nbsp; It was a violation of the decorum of bereavement
which was still fresh there, and from the indignant gloom of the
mistress of the house you might have inferred not so much that
the daughter was about to depart as that the mother was about to
arrive.&nbsp; There had been no conversation on the dreadful
subject at luncheon; for at luncheon at Mrs. Tramore&rsquo;s (her
son never came to it) there were always, even after funerals and
other miseries, stray guests of both sexes whose policy it was to
be cheerful and superficial.&nbsp; Rose had sat down as if
nothing had happened&mdash;nothing worse, that is, than her
father&rsquo;s death; but no one had spoken of anything that any
one else was thinking of.</p>
<p>Before she left the house a servant brought her a message from
her grandmother&mdash;the old lady desired to see her in the
drawing-room.&nbsp; She had on her bonnet, and she went down as
if she were about to step into her cab.&nbsp; Mrs. Tramore sat
there with her eternal knitting, from which she forebore even to
raise her eyes as, after a silence that seemed to express the
fulness of her reprobation, while Rose stood motionless, she
began: &ldquo;I wonder if you really understand what you&rsquo;re
doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not so stupid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never thought you were; but I don&rsquo;t know what
to make of you now.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re giving up
everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl was tempted to inquire whether her grandmother called
herself &ldquo;everything&rdquo;; but she checked this question,
answering instead that she knew she was giving up much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re taking a step of which you will feel the
effect to the end of your days,&rdquo; Mrs. Tramore went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a good conscience, I heartily hope,&rdquo; said
Rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your father&rsquo;s conscience was good enough for his
mother; it ought to be good enough for his daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rose sat down&mdash;she could afford to&mdash;as if she wished
to be very attentive and were still accessible to argument.&nbsp;
But this demonstration only ushered in, after a moment, the
surprising words &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think papa had any
conscience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What in the name of all that&rsquo;s unnatural do you
mean?&rdquo; Mrs. Tramore cried, over her glasses.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The dearest and best creature that ever lived!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was kind, he had charming impulses, he was
delightful.&nbsp; But he never reflected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Tramore stared, as if at a language she had never heard,
a farrago, a <i>galimatias</i>.&nbsp; Her life was made up of
items, but she had never had to deal, intellectually, with a fine
shade.&nbsp; Then while her needles, which had paused an instant,
began to fly again, she rejoined: &ldquo;Do you know what you
are, my dear?&nbsp; You&rsquo;re a dreadful little prig.&nbsp;
Where do you pick up such talk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I don&rsquo;t mean to judge between
them,&rdquo; Rose pursued.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can only judge between
my mother and myself.&nbsp; Papa couldn&rsquo;t judge for
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; And with this she got up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One would think you were horrid.&nbsp; I never thought
so before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re embarking on a struggle with
society,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Tramore, indulging in an unusual
flight of oratory.&nbsp; &ldquo;Society will put you in your
place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t it too many other things to do?&rdquo;
asked the girl.</p>
<p>This question had an ingenuity which led her grandmother to
meet it with a merely provisional and somewhat sketchy
answer.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your ignorance would be melancholy if your
behaviour were not so insane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no; I know perfectly what she&rsquo;ll do!&rdquo;
Rose replied, almost gaily.&nbsp; &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll drag me
down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She won&rsquo;t even do that,&rdquo; the old lady
declared contradictiously.&nbsp; &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll keep you
forever in the same dull hole.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall come and see <i>you</i>, granny, when I want
something more lively.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may come if you like, but you&rsquo;ll come no
further than the door.&nbsp; If you leave this house now you
don&rsquo;t enter it again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rose hesitated a moment.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you really mean
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may judge whether I choose such a time to
joke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, then,&rdquo; said the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rose quitted the room successfully enough; but on the other
side of the door, on the landing, she sank into a chair and
buried her face in her hands.&nbsp; She had burst into tears, and
she sobbed there for a moment, trying hard to recover herself, so
as to go downstairs without showing any traces of emotion,
passing before the servants and again perhaps before aunt
Julia.&nbsp; Mrs. Tramore was too old to cry; she could only drop
her knitting and, for a long time, sit with her head bowed and
her eyes closed.</p>
<p>Rose had reckoned justly with her aunt Julia; there were no
footmen, but this vigilant virgin was posted at the foot of the
stairs.&nbsp; She offered no challenge however; she only said:
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s some one in the parlour who wants to see
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; The girl demanded a name, but Miss Tramore only
mouthed inaudibly and winked and waved.&nbsp; Rose instantly
reflected that there was only one man in the world her aunt would
look such deep things about.&nbsp; &ldquo;Captain Jay?&rdquo; her
own eyes asked, while Miss Tramore&rsquo;s were those of a
conspirator: they were, for a moment, the only embarrassed eyes
Rose had encountered that day.&nbsp; They contributed to make
aunt Julia&rsquo;s further response evasive, after her niece
inquired if she had communicated in advance with this
visitor.&nbsp; Miss Tramore merely said that he had been upstairs
with her mother&mdash;hadn&rsquo;t she mentioned it?&mdash;and
had been waiting for her.&nbsp; She thought herself acute in not
putting the question of the girl&rsquo;s seeing him before her as
a favour to him or to herself; she presented it as a duty, and
wound up with the proposition: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not fair to him,
it&rsquo;s not kind, not to let him speak to you before you
go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does he want to say?&rdquo; Rose demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go in and find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She really knew, for she had found out before; but after
standing uncertain an instant she went in.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
parlour&rdquo; was the name that had always been borne by a
spacious sitting-room downstairs, an apartment occupied by her
father during his frequent phases of residence in Hill
Street&mdash;episodes increasingly frequent after his house in
the country had, in consequence, as Rose perfectly knew, of his
spending too much money, been disposed of at a sacrifice which he
always characterised as horrid.&nbsp; He had been left with the
place in Hertfordshire and his mother with the London house, on
the general understanding that they would change about; but
during the last years the community had grown more rigid, mainly
at his mother&rsquo;s expense.&nbsp; The parlour was full of his
memory and his habits and his things&mdash;his books and pictures
and <i>bibelots</i>, objects that belonged now to Eric.&nbsp;
Rose had sat in it for hours since his death; it was the place in
which she could still be nearest to him.&nbsp; But she felt far
from him as Captain Jay rose erect on her opening the door.&nbsp;
This was a very different presence.&nbsp; He had not liked
Captain Jay.&nbsp; She herself had, but not enough to make a
great complication of her father&rsquo;s coldness.&nbsp; This
afternoon however she foresaw complications.&nbsp; At the very
outset for instance she was not pleased with his having arranged
such a surprise for her with her grandmother and her aunt.&nbsp;
It was probably aunt Julia who had sent for him; her grandmother
wouldn&rsquo;t have done it.&nbsp; It placed him immediately on
their side, and Rose was almost as disappointed at this as if she
had not known it was quite where he would naturally be.&nbsp; He
had never paid her a special visit, but if that was what he
wished to do why shouldn&rsquo;t he have waited till she should
be under her mother&rsquo;s roof?&nbsp; She knew the reason, but
she had an angry prospect of enjoyment in making him express
it.&nbsp; She liked him enough, after all, if it were measured by
the idea of what she could make him do.</p>
<p>In Bertram Jay the elements were surprisingly mingled; you
would have gone astray, in reading him, if you had counted on
finding the complements of some of his qualities.&nbsp; He would
not however have struck you in the least as incomplete, for in
every case in which you didn&rsquo;t find the complement you
would have found the contradiction.&nbsp; He was in the Royal
Engineers, and was tall, lean and high-shouldered.&nbsp; He
looked every inch a soldier, yet there were people who considered
that he had missed his vocation in not becoming a parson.&nbsp;
He took a public interest in the spiritual life of the
army.&nbsp; Other persons still, on closer observation, would
have felt that his most appropriate field was neither the army
nor the church, but simply the world&mdash;the social,
successful, worldly world.&nbsp; If he had a sword in one hand
and a Bible in the other he had a Court Guide concealed somewhere
about his person.&nbsp; His profile was hard and handsome, his
eyes were both cold and kind, his dark straight hair was
imperturbably smooth and prematurely streaked with grey.&nbsp;
There was nothing in existence that he didn&rsquo;t take
seriously.&nbsp; He had a first-rate power of work and an
ambition as minutely organised as a German plan of
invasion.&nbsp; His only real recreation was to go to church, but
he went to parties when he had time.&nbsp; If he was in love with
Rose Tramore this was distracting to him only in the same sense
as his religion, and it was included in that department of his
extremely sub-divided life.&nbsp; His religion indeed was of an
encroaching, annexing sort.&nbsp; Seen from in front he looked
diffident and blank, but he was capable of exposing himself in a
way (to speak only of the paths of peace) wholly inconsistent
with shyness.&nbsp; He had a passion for instance for open-air
speaking, but was not thought on the whole to excel in it unless
he could help himself out with a hymn.&nbsp; In conversation he
kept his eyes on you with a kind of colourless candour, as if he
had not understood what you were saying and, in a fashion that
made many people turn red, waited before answering.&nbsp; This
was only because he was considering their remarks in more
relations than they had intended.&nbsp; He had in his face no
expression whatever save the one just mentioned, and was, in his
profession, already very distinguished.</p>
<p>He had seen Rose Tramore for the first time on a Sunday of the
previous March, at a house in the country at which she was
staying with her father, and five weeks later he had made her, by
letter, an offer of marriage.&nbsp; She showed her father the
letter of course, and he told her that it would give him great
pleasure that she should send Captain Jay about his
business.&nbsp; &ldquo;My dear child,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we
must really have some one who will be better fun than
that.&rdquo;&nbsp; Rose had declined the honour, very
considerately and kindly, but not simply because her father
wished it.&nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t herself wish to detach this
flower from the stem, though when the young man wrote again, to
express the hope that he <i>might</i> hope&mdash;so long was he
willing to wait&mdash;and ask if he might not still sometimes see
her, she answered even more indulgently than at first.&nbsp; She
had shown her father her former letter, but she didn&rsquo;t show
him this one; she only told him what it contained, submitting to
him also that of her correspondent.&nbsp; Captain Jay moreover
wrote to Mr. Tramore, who replied sociably, but so vaguely that
he almost neglected the subject under discussion&mdash;a
communication that made poor Bertram ponder long.&nbsp; He could
never get to the bottom of the superficial, and all the
proprieties and conventions of life were profound to him.&nbsp;
Fortunately for him old Mrs. Tramore liked him, he was
satisfactory to her long-sightedness; so that a relation was
established under cover of which he still occasionally presented
himself in Hill Street&mdash;presented himself nominally to the
mistress of the house.&nbsp; He had had scruples about the
veracity of his visits, but he had disposed of them; he had
scruples about so many things that he had had to invent a general
way, to dig a central drain.&nbsp; Julia Tramore happened to meet
him when she came up to town, and she took a view of him more
benevolent than her usual estimate of people encouraged by her
mother.&nbsp; The fear of agreeing with that lady was a motive,
but there was a stronger one, in this particular case, in the
fear of agreeing with her niece, who had rejected him.&nbsp; His
situation might be held to have improved when Mr. Tramore was
taken so gravely ill that with regard to his recovery those about
him left their eyes to speak for their lips; and in the light of
the poor gentleman&rsquo;s recent death it was doubtless better
than it had ever been.</p>
<p>He was only a quarter of an hour with the girl, but this gave
him time to take the measure of it.&nbsp; After he had spoken to
her about her bereavement, very much as an especially mild
missionary might have spoken to a beautiful Polynesian, he let
her know that he had learned from her companions the very strong
step she was about to take.&nbsp; This led to their spending
together ten minutes which, to her mind, threw more light on his
character than anything that had ever passed between them.&nbsp;
She had always felt with him as if she were standing on an edge,
looking down into something decidedly deep.&nbsp; To-day the
impression of the perpendicular shaft was there, but it was
rather an abyss of confusion and disorder than the large bright
space in which she had figured everything as ranged and
pigeon-holed, presenting the appearance of the labelled shelves
and drawers at a chemist&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He discussed without an
invitation to discuss, he appealed without a right to
appeal.&nbsp; He was nothing but a suitor tolerated after
dismissal, but he took strangely for granted a participation in
her affairs.&nbsp; He assumed all sorts of things that made her
draw back.&nbsp; He implied that there was everything now to
assist them in arriving at an agreement, since she had never
informed him that he was positively objectionable; but that this
symmetry would be spoiled if she should not be willing to take a
little longer to think of certain consequences.&nbsp; She was
greatly disconcerted when she saw what consequences he meant and
at his reminding her of them.&nbsp; What on earth was the use of
a lover if he was to speak only like one&rsquo;s grandmother and
one&rsquo;s aunt?&nbsp; He struck her as much in love with her
and as particularly careful at the same time as to what he might
say.&nbsp; He never mentioned her mother; he only alluded,
indirectly but earnestly, to the &ldquo;step.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
disapproved of it altogether, took an unexpectedly prudent,
politic view of it.&nbsp; He evidently also believed that she
would be dragged down; in other words that she would not be asked
out.&nbsp; It was his idea that her mother would contaminate her,
so that he should find himself interested in a young person
discredited and virtually unmarriageable.&nbsp; All this was more
obvious to him than the consideration that a daughter should be
merciful.&nbsp; Where was his religion if he understood mercy so
little, and where were his talent and his courage if he were so
miserably afraid of trumpery social penalties?&nbsp; Rose&rsquo;s
heart sank when she reflected that a man supposed to be
first-rate hadn&rsquo;t guessed that rather than not do what she
could for her mother she would give up all the Engineers in the
world.&nbsp; She became aware that she probably would have been
moved to place her hand in his on the spot if he had come to her
saying &ldquo;Your idea is the right one; put it through at every
cost.&rdquo;&nbsp; She couldn&rsquo;t discuss this with him,
though he impressed her as having too much at stake for her to
treat him with mere disdain.&nbsp; She sickened at the revelation
that a gentleman could see so much in mere vulgarities of
opinion, and though she uttered as few words as possible,
conversing only in sad smiles and headshakes and in intercepted
movements toward the door, she happened, in some unguarded lapse
from her reticence, to use the expression that she was
disappointed in him.&nbsp; He caught at it and, seeming to drop
his field-glass, pressed upon her with nearer, tenderer eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I be so happy as to believe, then, that you had
thought of me with some confidence, with some faith?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you didn&rsquo;t suppose so, what is the sense of
this visit?&rdquo; Rose asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One can be faithful without reciprocity,&rdquo; said
the young man.&nbsp; &ldquo;I regard you in a light which makes
me want to protect you even if I have nothing to gain by
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet you speak as if you thought you might keep me for
yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For <i>yourself</i>.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want you to
suffer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor to suffer yourself by my doing so,&rdquo; said
Rose, looking down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, if you would only marry me next month!&rdquo; he
broke out inconsequently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And give up going to mamma?&rdquo; Rose waited to see
if he would say &ldquo;What need that matter?&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t
your mother come to us?&rdquo;&nbsp; But he said nothing of the
sort; he only answered&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She surely would be sorry to interfere with the
exercise of any other affection which I might have the bliss of
believing that you are now free, in however small a degree, to
entertain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rose knew that her mother wouldn&rsquo;t be sorry at all; but
she contented herself with rejoining, her hand on the door:
&ldquo;Good-bye.&nbsp; I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t suffer.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m not afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know how terrible, how cruel, the world
can be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do know.&nbsp; I know everything!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The declaration sprang from her lips in a tone which made him
look at her as he had never looked before, as if he saw something
new in her face, as if he had never yet known her.&nbsp; He
hadn&rsquo;t displeased her so much but that she would like to
give him that impression, and since she felt that she was doing
so she lingered an instant for the purpose.&nbsp; It enabled her
to see, further, that he turned red; then to become aware that a
carriage had stopped at the door.&nbsp; Captain Jay&rsquo;s eyes,
from where he stood, fell upon this arrival, and the nature of
their glance made Rose step forward to look.&nbsp; Her mother sat
there, brilliant, conspicuous, in the eternal victoria, and the
footman was already sounding the knocker.&nbsp; It had been no
part of the arrangement that she should come to fetch her; it had
been out of the question&mdash;a stroke in such bad taste as
would have put Rose in the wrong.&nbsp; The girl had never
dreamed of it, but somehow, suddenly, perversely, she was glad of
it now; she even hoped that her grandmother and her aunt were
looking out upstairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother has come for me.&nbsp; Good-bye,&rdquo; she
repeated; but this time her visitor had got between her and the
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen to me before you go.&nbsp; I will give you a
life&rsquo;s devotion,&rdquo; the young man pleaded.&nbsp; He
really barred the way.</p>
<p>She wondered whether her grandmother had told him that if her
flight were not prevented she would forfeit money.&nbsp; Then,
vividly, it came over her that this would be what he was occupied
with.&nbsp; &ldquo;I shall never think of you&mdash;let me
go!&rdquo; she cried, with passion.</p>
<p>Captain Jay opened the door, but Rose didn&rsquo;t see his
face, and in a moment she was out of the house.&nbsp; Aunt Julia,
who was sure to have been hovering, had taken flight before the
profanity of the knock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heavens, dear, where did you get your mourning?&rdquo;
the lady in the victoria asked of her daughter as they drove
away.</p>
<h3>II.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Maresfield</span> had given her boy a
push in his plump back and had said to him, &ldquo;Go and speak
to her now; it&rsquo;s your chance.&rdquo;&nbsp; She had for a
long time wanted this scion to make himself audible to Rose
Tramore, but the opportunity was not easy to come by.&nbsp; The
case was complicated.&nbsp; Lady Maresfield had four daughters,
of whom only one was married.&nbsp; It so happened moreover that
this one, Mrs. Vaughan-Vesey, the only person in the world her
mother was afraid of, was the most to be reckoned with.&nbsp; The
Honourable Guy was in appearance all his mother&rsquo;s child,
though he was really a simpler soul.&nbsp; He was large and pink;
large, that is, as to everything but the eyes, which were
diminishing points, and pink as to everything but the hair, which
was comparable, faintly, to the hue of the richer rose.&nbsp; He
had also, it must be conceded, very small neat teeth, which made
his smile look like a young lady&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He had no wish to
resemble any such person, but he was perpetually smiling, and he
smiled more than ever as he approached Rose Tramore, who, looking
altogether, to his mind, as a pretty girl should, and wearing a
soft white opera-cloak over a softer black dress, leaned alone
against the wall of the vestibule at Covent Garden while, a few
paces off, an old gentleman engaged her mother in
conversation.&nbsp; Madame Patti had been singing, and they were
all waiting for their carriages.&nbsp; To their ears at present
came a vociferation of names and a rattle of wheels.&nbsp; The
air, through banging doors, entered in damp, warm gusts, heavy
with the stale, slightly sweet taste of the London season when
the London season is overripe and spoiling.</p>
<p>Guy Mangler had only three minutes to re&euml;stablish an
interrupted acquaintance with our young lady.&nbsp; He reminded
her that he had danced with her the year before, and he mentioned
that he knew her brother.&nbsp; His mother had lately been to see
old Mrs. Tramore, but this he did not mention, not being aware of
it.&nbsp; That visit had produced, on Lady Maresfield&rsquo;s
part, a private crisis, engendered ideas.&nbsp; One of them was
that the grandmother in Hill Street had really forgiven the
wilful girl much more than she admitted.&nbsp; Another was that
there would still be some money for Rose when the others should
come into theirs.&nbsp; Still another was that the others would
come into theirs at no distant date; the old lady was so visibly
going to pieces.&nbsp; There were several more besides, as for
instance that Rose had already fifteen hundred a year from her
father.&nbsp; The figure had been betrayed in Hill Street; it was
part of the proof of Mrs. Tramore&rsquo;s decrepitude.&nbsp; Then
there was an equal amount that her mother had to dispose of and
on which the girl could absolutely count, though of course it
might involve much waiting, as the mother, a person of gross
insensibility, evidently wouldn&rsquo;t die of
cold-shouldering.&nbsp; Equally definite, to do it justice, was
the conception that Rose was in truth remarkably good looking,
and that what she had undertaken to do showed, and would show
even should it fail, cleverness of the right sort.&nbsp;
Cleverness of the right sort was exactly the quality that Lady
Maresfield prefigured as indispensable in a young lady to whom
she should marry her second son, over whose own deficiencies she
flung the veil of a maternal theory that <i>his</i> cleverness
was of a sort that was wrong.&nbsp; Those who knew him less well
were content to wish that he might not conceal it for such a
scruple.&nbsp; This enumeration of his mother&rsquo;s views does
not exhaust the list, and it was in obedience to one too profound
to be uttered even by the historian that, after a very brief
delay, she decided to move across the crowded lobby.&nbsp; Her
daughter Bessie was the only one with her; Maggie was dining with
the Vaughan-Veseys, and Fanny was not of an age.&nbsp; Mrs.
Tramore the younger showed only an admirable back&mdash;her face
was to her old gentleman&mdash;and Bessie had drifted to some
other people; so that it was comparatively easy for Lady
Maresfield to say to Rose, in a moment: &ldquo;My dear child, are
you never coming to see us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall be delighted to come if you&rsquo;ll ask
us,&rdquo; Rose smiled.</p>
<p>Lady Maresfield had been prepared for the plural number, and
she was a woman whom it took many plurals to disconcert.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure Guy is longing for another dance with
you,&rdquo; she rejoined, with the most unblinking
irrelevance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid we&rsquo;re not dancing again quite
yet,&rdquo; said Rose, glancing at her mother&rsquo;s exposed
shoulders, but speaking as if they were muffled in crape.</p>
<p>Lady Maresfield leaned her head on one side and seemed almost
wistful.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not even at my sister&rsquo;s ball?&nbsp;
She&rsquo;s to have something next week.&nbsp; She&rsquo;ll write
to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rose Tramore, on the spot, looking bright but vague, turned
three or four things over in her mind.&nbsp; She remembered that
the sister of her interlocutress was the proverbially rich Mrs.
Bray, a bankeress or a breweress or a builderess, who had so big
a house that she couldn&rsquo;t fill it unless she opened her
doors, or her mouth, very wide.&nbsp; Rose had learnt more about
London society during these lonely months with her mother than
she had ever picked up in Hill Street.&nbsp; The younger Mrs.
Tramore was a mine of <i>comm&eacute;rages</i>, and she had no
need to go out to bring home the latest intelligence.&nbsp; At
any rate Mrs. Bray might serve as the end of a wedge.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh, I dare say we might think of that,&rdquo; Rose
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;It would be very kind of your
sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guy&rsquo;ll think of it, won&rsquo;t you, Guy?&rdquo;
asked Lady Maresfield.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather!&rdquo; Guy responded, with an intonation as
fine as if he had learnt it at a music hall; while at the same
moment the name of his mother&rsquo;s carriage was bawled through
the place.&nbsp; Mrs. Tramore had parted with her old gentleman;
she turned again to her daughter.&nbsp; Nothing occurred but what
always occurred, which was exactly this absence of
everything&mdash;a universal lapse.&nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t exist,
even for a second, to any recognising eye.&nbsp; The people who
looked at her&mdash;of course there were plenty of
those&mdash;were only the people who didn&rsquo;t exist for
hers.&nbsp; Lady Maresfield surged away on her son&rsquo;s
arm.</p>
<p>It was this noble matron herself who wrote, the next day,
inclosing a card of invitation from Mrs. Bray and expressing the
hope that Rose would come and dine and let her ladyship take
her.&nbsp; She should have only one of her own girls; Gwendolen
Vesey was to take the other.&nbsp; Rose handed both the note and
the card in silence to her mother; the latter exhibited only the
name of Miss Tramore.&nbsp; &ldquo;You had much better go,
dear,&rdquo; her mother said; in answer to which Miss Tramore
slowly tore up the documents, looking with clear, meditative eyes
out of the window.&nbsp; Her mother always said &ldquo;You had
better go&rdquo;&mdash;there had been other incidents&mdash;and
Rose had never even once taken account of the observation.&nbsp;
She would make no first advances, only plenty of second ones,
and, condoning no discrimination, would treat no omission as
venial.&nbsp; She would keep all concessions till afterwards;
then she would make them one by one.&nbsp; Fighting society was
quite as hard as her grandmother had said it would be; but there
was a tension in it which made the dreariness vibrate&mdash;the
dreariness of such a winter as she had just passed.&nbsp; Her
companion had cried at the end of it, and she had cried all
through; only her tears had been private, while her
mother&rsquo;s had fallen once for all, at luncheon on the bleak
Easter Monday&mdash;produced by the way a silent survey of the
deadly square brought home to her that every creature but
themselves was out of town and having tremendous fun.&nbsp; Rose
felt that it was useless to attempt to explain simply by her
mourning this severity of solitude; for if people didn&rsquo;t go
to parties (at least a few didn&rsquo;t) for six months after
their father died, this was the very time other people took for
coming to see them.&nbsp; It was not too much to say that during
this first winter of Rose&rsquo;s period with her mother she had
no communication whatever with the world.&nbsp; It had the effect
of making her take to reading the new American books: she wanted
to see how girls got on by themselves.&nbsp; She had never read
so much before, and there was a legitimate indifference in it
when topics failed with her mother.&nbsp; They often failed after
the first days, and then, while she bent over instructive
volumes, this lady, dressed as if for an impending function, sat
on the sofa and watched her.&nbsp; Rose was not embarrassed by
such an appearance, for she could reflect that, a little before,
her companion had not even a girl who had taken refuge in queer
researches to look at.&nbsp; She was moreover used to her
mother&rsquo;s attitude by this time.&nbsp; She had her own
description of it: it was the attitude of waiting for the
carriage.&nbsp; If they didn&rsquo;t go out it was not that Mrs.
Tramore was not ready in time, and Rose had even an alarmed
prevision of their some day always arriving first.&nbsp; Mrs.
Tramore&rsquo;s conversation at such moments was abrupt,
inconsequent and personal.&nbsp; She sat on the edge of sofas and
chairs and glanced occasionally at the fit of her gloves (she was
perpetually gloved, and the fit was a thing it was melancholy to
see wasted), as people do who are expecting guests to
dinner.&nbsp; Rose used almost to fancy herself at times a
perfunctory husband on the other side of the fire.</p>
<p>What she was not yet used to&mdash;there was still a charm in
it&mdash;was her mother&rsquo;s extraordinary tact.&nbsp; During
the years they lived together they never had a discussion; a
circumstance all the more remarkable since if the girl had a
reason for sparing her companion (that of being sorry for her)
Mrs. Tramore had none for sparing her child.&nbsp; She only
showed in doing so a happy instinct&mdash;the happiest thing
about her.&nbsp; She took in perfection a course which
represented everything and covered everything; she utterly
abjured all authority.&nbsp; She testified to her abjuration in
hourly ingenious, touching ways.&nbsp; In this manner nothing had
to be talked over, which was a mercy all round.&nbsp; The tears
on Easter Monday were merely a nervous gust, to help show she was
not a Christmas doll from the Burlington Arcade; and there was no
lifting up of the repentant Magdalen, no uttered remorse for the
former abandonment of children.&nbsp; Of the way she could treat
her children her demeanour to this one was an example; it was an
uninterrupted appeal to her eldest daughter for direction.&nbsp;
She took the law from Rose in every circumstance, and if you had
noticed these ladies without knowing their history you would have
wondered what tie was fine enough to make maturity so respectful
to youth.&nbsp; No mother was ever so filial as Mrs. Tramore, and
there had never been such a difference of position between
sisters.&nbsp; Not that the elder one fawned, which would have
been fearful; she only renounced&mdash;whatever she had to
renounce.&nbsp; If the amount was not much she at any rate made
no scene over it.&nbsp; Her hand was so light that Rose said of
her secretly, in vague glances at the past, &ldquo;No wonder
people liked her!&rdquo;&nbsp; She never characterised the old
element of interference with her mother&rsquo;s respectability
more definitely than as &ldquo;people.&rdquo;&nbsp; They were
people, it was true, for whom gentleness must have been
everything and who didn&rsquo;t demand a variety of
interests.&nbsp; The desire to &ldquo;go out&rdquo; was the one
passion that even a closer acquaintance with her parent revealed
to Rose Tramore.&nbsp; She marvelled at its strength, in the
light of the poor lady&rsquo;s history: there was comedy enough
in this unquenchable flame on the part of a woman who had known
such misery.&nbsp; She had drunk deep of every dishonour, but the
bitter cup had left her with a taste for lighted candles, for
squeezing up staircases and hooking herself to the human
elbow.&nbsp; Rose had a vision of the future years in which this
taste would grow with restored exercise&mdash;of her mother, in a
long-tailed dress, jogging on and on and on, jogging further and
further from her sins, through a century of the &ldquo;Morning
Post&rdquo; and down the fashionable avenue of time.&nbsp; She
herself would then be very old&mdash;she herself would be
dead.&nbsp; Mrs. Tramore would cover a span of life for which
such an allowance of sin was small.&nbsp; The girl could laugh
indeed now at that theory of her being dragged down.&nbsp; If one
thing were more present to her than another it was the very
desolation of their propriety.&nbsp; As she glanced at her
companion, it sometimes seemed to her that if she had been a bad
woman she would have been worse than that.&nbsp; There were
compensations for being &ldquo;cut&rdquo; which Mrs. Tramore too
much neglected.</p>
<p>The lonely old lady in Hill Street&mdash;Rose thought of her
that way now&mdash;was the one person to whom she was ready to
say that she would come to her on any terms.&nbsp; She wrote this
to her three times over, and she knocked still oftener at her
door.&nbsp; But the old lady answered no letters; if Rose had
remained in Hill Street it would have been her own function to
answer them; and at the door, the butler, whom the girl had known
for ten years, considered her, when he told her his mistress was
not at home, quite as he might have considered a young person who
had come about a place and of whose eligibility he took a
negative view.&nbsp; That was Rose&rsquo;s one pang, that she
probably appeared rather heartless.&nbsp; Her aunt Julia had gone
to Florence with Edith for the winter, on purpose to make her
appear more so; for Miss Tramore was still the person most
scandalised by her secession.&nbsp; Edith and she, doubtless,
often talked over in Florence the destitution of the aged victim
in Hill Street.&nbsp; Eric never came to see his sister, because,
being full both of family and of personal feeling, he thought she
really ought to have stayed with his grandmother.&nbsp; If she
had had such an appurtenance all to herself she might have done
what she liked with it; but he couldn&rsquo;t forgive such a want
of consideration for anything of his.&nbsp; There were moments
when Rose would have been ready to take her hand from the plough
and insist upon reintegration, if only the fierce voice of the
old house had allowed people to look her up.&nbsp; But she read,
ever so clearly, that her grandmother had made this a question of
loyalty to seventy years of virtue.&nbsp; Mrs. Tramore&rsquo;s
forlornness didn&rsquo;t prevent her drawing-room from being a
very public place, in which Rose could hear certain words
reverberate: &ldquo;Leave her alone; it&rsquo;s the only way to
see how long she&rsquo;ll hold out.&rdquo;&nbsp; The old
woman&rsquo;s visitors were people who didn&rsquo;t wish to
quarrel, and the girl was conscious that if they had not let her
alone&mdash;that is if they had come to her from her
grandmother&mdash;she might perhaps not have held out.&nbsp; She
had no friends quite of her own; she had not been brought up to
have them, and it would not have been easy in a house which two
such persons as her father and his mother divided between
them.&nbsp; Her father disapproved of crude intimacies, and all
the intimacies of youth were crude.&nbsp; He had married at
five-and-twenty and could testify to such a truth.&nbsp; Rose
felt that she shared even Captain Jay with her grandmother; she
had seen what <i>he</i> was worth.&nbsp; Moreover, she had spoken
to him at that last moment in Hill Street in a way which, taken
with her former refusal, made it impossible that he should come
near her again.&nbsp; She hoped he went to see his protectress:
he could be a kind of substitute and administer comfort.</p>
<p>It so happened, however, that the day after she threw Lady
Maresfield&rsquo;s invitation into the wastepaper basket she
received a visit from a certain Mrs. Donovan, whom she had
occasionally seen in Hill Street.&nbsp; She vaguely knew this
lady for a busybody, but she was in a situation which even
busybodies might alleviate.&nbsp; Mrs. Donovan was poor, but
honest&mdash;so scrupulously honest that she was perpetually
returning visits she had never received.&nbsp; She was always
clad in weather-beaten sealskin, and had an odd air of being
prepared for the worst, which was borne out by her denying that
she was Irish.&nbsp; She was of the English Donovans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear child, won&rsquo;t you go out with me?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>
<p>Rose looked at her a moment and then rang the bell.&nbsp; She
spoke of something else, without answering the question, and when
the servant came she said: &ldquo;Please tell Mrs. Tramore that
Mrs. Donovan has come to see her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;ll be delightful; only you mustn&rsquo;t
tell your grandmother!&rdquo; the visitor exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell her what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I come to see your mamma.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure I hoped you&rsquo;d introduce me!&rdquo; cried
Mrs. Donovan, compromising herself in her embarrassment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not necessary; you knew her once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed and I&rsquo;ve known every one once,&rdquo; the
visitor confessed.</p>
<p>Mrs. Tramore, when she came in, was charming and exactly
right; she greeted Mrs. Donovan as if she had met her the week
before last, giving her daughter such a new illustration of her
tact that Rose again had the idea that it was no wonder
&ldquo;people&rdquo; had liked her.&nbsp; The girl grudged Mrs.
Donovan so fresh a morsel as a description of her mother at home,
rejoicing that she would be inconvenienced by having to keep the
story out of Hill Street.&nbsp; Her mother went away before Mrs.
Donovan departed, and Rose was touched by guessing her
reason&mdash;the thought that since even this circuitous
personage had been moved to come, the two might, if left
together, invent some remedy.&nbsp; Rose waited to see what Mrs.
Donovan had in fact invented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t come out with me then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come out with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My daughters are married.&nbsp; You know I&rsquo;m a
lone woman.&nbsp; It would be an immense pleasure to me to have
so charming a creature as yourself to present to the
world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I go out with my mother,&rdquo; said Rose, after a
moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but sometimes when she&rsquo;s not
inclined?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She goes everywhere she wants to go,&rdquo; Rose
continued, uttering the biggest fib of her life and only
regretting it should be wasted on Mrs. Donovan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but do you go everywhere <i>you</i> want?&rdquo;
the lady asked sociably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One goes even to places one hates.&nbsp; Every one does
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, what I go through!&rdquo; this social martyr
cried.&nbsp; Then she laid a persuasive hand on the girl&rsquo;s
arm.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let me show you at a few places first, and then
we&rsquo;ll see.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll bring them all here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I understand you,&rdquo; replied
Rose, though in Mrs. Donovan&rsquo;s words she perfectly saw her
own theory of the case reflected.&nbsp; For a quarter of a minute
she asked herself whether she might not, after all, do so much
evil that good might come.&nbsp; Mrs. Donovan would take her out
the next day, and be thankful enough to annex such an attraction
as a pretty girl.&nbsp; Various consequences would ensue and the
long delay would be shortened; her mother&rsquo;s drawing-room
would resound with the clatter of teacups.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Bray&rsquo;s having some big thing next week; come
with me there and I&rsquo;ll show you what I mane,&rdquo; Mrs.
Donovan pleaded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see what you mane,&rdquo; Rose answered, brushing
away her temptation and getting up.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m much
obliged to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know you&rsquo;re wrong, my dear,&rdquo; said her
interlocutress, with angry little eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to Mrs. Bray&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get you a kyard; it&rsquo;ll only cost me a
penny stamp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got one,&rdquo; said the girl, smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean a penny stamp?&rdquo;&nbsp; Mrs. Donovan,
especially at departure, always observed all the forms of
amity.&nbsp; &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do it alone, my
darling,&rdquo; she declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall they call you a cab?&rdquo; Rose asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pick one up.&nbsp; I choose my horse.&nbsp;
You know you require your start,&rdquo; her visitor went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse my mother,&rdquo; was Rose&rsquo;s only
reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mention it.&nbsp; Come to me when you need
me.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll find me in the Red Book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s awfully kind of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Donovan lingered a moment on the threshold.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Who will you <i>have</i> now, my child?&rdquo; she
appealed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t have any one!&rdquo;&nbsp; Rose turned
away, blushing for her.&nbsp; &ldquo;She came on
speculation,&rdquo; she said afterwards to Mrs. Tramore.</p>
<p>Her mother looked at her a moment in silence.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
can do it if you like, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rose made no direct answer to this observation; she remarked
instead: &ldquo;See what our quiet life allows us to
escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t escape it.&nbsp; She has been here an
hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once in twenty years!&nbsp; We might meet her three
times a day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;d take her with the rest!&rdquo; sighed
Mrs. Tramore; while her daughter recognised that what her
companion wanted to do was just what Mrs. Donovan was
doing.&nbsp; Mrs. Donovan&rsquo;s life was her ideal.</p>
<p>On a Sunday, ten days later, Rose went to see one of her old
governesses, of whom she had lost sight for some time and who had
written to her that she was in London, unoccupied and ill.&nbsp;
This was just the sort of relation into which she could throw
herself now with inordinate zeal; the idea of it, however, not
preventing a foretaste of the queer expression in the excellent
lady&rsquo;s face when she should mention with whom she was
living.&nbsp; While she smiled at this picture she threw in
another joke, asking herself if Miss Hack could be held in any
degree to constitute the nucleus of a circle.&nbsp; She would
come to see her, in any event&mdash;come the more the further she
was dragged down.&nbsp; Sunday was always a difficult day with
the two ladies&mdash;the afternoons made it so apparent that they
were not frequented.&nbsp; Her mother, it is true, was comprised
in the habits of two or three old gentlemen&mdash;she had for a
long time avoided male friends of less than seventy&mdash;who
disliked each other enough to make the room, when they were there
at once, crack with pressure.&nbsp; Rose sat for a long time with
Miss Hack, doing conscientious justice to the conception that
there could be troubles in the world worse than her own; and when
she came back her mother was alone, but with a story to tell of a
long visit from Mr. Guy Mangler, who had waited and waited for
her return.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s in love with you; he&rsquo;s
coming again on Tuesday,&rdquo; Mrs. Tramore announced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he say so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That he&rsquo;s coming back on Tuesday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, that he&rsquo;s in love with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t need, when he stayed two
hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With you?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s you he&rsquo;s in love with,
mamma!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will do as well,&rdquo; laughed Mrs.
Tramore.&nbsp; &ldquo;For all the use we shall make of
him!&rdquo; she added in a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall make great use of him.&nbsp; His mother sent
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;ll never come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then <i>he</i> sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said
Rose.&nbsp; Yet he was admitted on the Tuesday, and after she had
given him his tea Mrs. Tramore left the young people alone.&nbsp;
Rose wished she hadn&rsquo;t&mdash;she herself had another
view.&nbsp; At any rate she disliked her mother&rsquo;s view,
which she had easily guessed.&nbsp; Mr. Mangler did nothing but
say how charming he thought his hostess of the Sunday, and what a
tremendously jolly visit he had had.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t remark
in so many words &ldquo;I had no idea your mother was such a good
sort&rdquo;; but this was the spirit of his simple
discourse.&nbsp; Rose liked it at first&mdash;a little of it
gratified her; then she thought there was too much of it for good
taste.&nbsp; She had to reflect that one does what one can and
that Mr. Mangler probably thought he was delicate.&nbsp; He
wished to convey that he desired to make up to her for the
injustice of society.&nbsp; Why shouldn&rsquo;t her mother
receive gracefully, she asked (not audibly) and who had ever said
she didn&rsquo;t?&nbsp; Mr. Mangler had a great deal to say about
the disappointment of his own parent over Miss Tramore&rsquo;s
not having come to dine with them the night of his aunt&rsquo;s
ball.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lady Maresfield knows why I didn&rsquo;t come,&rdquo;
Rose answered at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, now, but <i>I</i> don&rsquo;t, you know;
can&rsquo;t you tell <i>me</i>?&rdquo; asked the young man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter, if your mother&rsquo;s clear
about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but why make such an awful mystery of it, when
I&rsquo;m dying to know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He talked about this, he chaffed her about it for the rest of
his visit: he had at last found a topic after his own
heart.&nbsp; If her mother considered that he might be the emblem
of their redemption he was an engine of the most primitive
construction.&nbsp; He stayed and stayed; he struck Rose as on
the point of bringing out something for which he had not quite,
as he would have said, the cheek.&nbsp; Sometimes she thought he
was going to begin: &ldquo;By the way, my mother told me to
propose to you.&rdquo;&nbsp; At other moments he seemed charged
with the admission: &ldquo;I say, of course I really know what
you&rsquo;re trying to do for her,&rdquo; nodding at the door:
&ldquo;therefore hadn&rsquo;t we better speak of it frankly, so
that I can help you with my mother, and more particularly with my
sister Gwendolen, who&rsquo;s the difficult one?&nbsp; The fact
is, you see, they won&rsquo;t do anything for nothing.&nbsp; If
you&rsquo;ll accept me they&rsquo;ll call, but they won&rsquo;t
call without something &lsquo;down.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr.
Mangler departed without their speaking frankly, and Rose Tramore
had a hot hour during which she almost entertained, vindictively,
the project of &ldquo;accepting&rdquo; the limpid youth until
after she should have got her mother into circulation.&nbsp; The
cream of the vision was that she might break with him
later.&nbsp; She could read that this was what her mother would
have liked, but the next time he came the door was closed to him,
and the next and the next.</p>
<p>In August there was nothing to do but to go abroad, with the
sense on Rose&rsquo;s part that the battle was still all to
fight; for a round of country visits was not in prospect, and
English watering-places constituted one of the few subjects on
which the girl had heard her mother express herself with
disgust.&nbsp; Continental autumns had been indeed for years, one
of the various forms of Mrs. Tramore&rsquo;s atonement, but Rose
could only infer that such fruit as they had borne was
bitter.&nbsp; The stony stare of Belgravia could be practised at
Homburg; and somehow it was inveterately only gentlemen who sat
next to her at the <i>table d&rsquo;h&ocirc;te</i> at
Cadenabbia.&nbsp; Gentlemen had never been of any use to Mrs.
Tramore for getting back into society; they had only helped her
effectually to get out of it.&nbsp; She once dropped, to her
daughter, in a moralising mood, the remark that it was
astonishing how many of them one could know without its doing one
any good.&nbsp; Fifty of them&mdash;even very clever
ones&mdash;represented a value inferior to that of one stupid
woman.&nbsp; Rose wondered at the offhand way in which her mother
could talk of fifty clever men; it seemed to her that the whole
world couldn&rsquo;t contain such a number.&nbsp; She had a
sombre sense that mankind must be dull and mean.&nbsp; These
cogitations took place in a cold hotel, in an eternal Swiss rain,
and they had a flat echo in the transalpine valleys, as the
lonely ladies went vaguely down to the Italian lakes and
cities.&nbsp; Rose guided their course, at moments, with a kind
of aimless ferocity; she moved abruptly, feeling vulgar and
hating their life, though destitute of any definite vision of
another life that would have been open to her.&nbsp; She had set
herself a task and she clung to it; but she appeared to herself
despicably idle.&nbsp; She had succeeded in not going to Homburg
waters, where London was trying to wash away some of its stains;
that would be too staring an advertisement of their
situation.&nbsp; The main difference in situations to her now was
the difference of being more or less pitied, at the best an
intolerable danger; so that the places she preferred were the
unsuspicious ones.&nbsp; She wanted to triumph with contempt, not
with submission.</p>
<p>One morning in September, coming with her mother out of the
marble church at Milan, she perceived that a gentleman who had
just passed her on his way into the cathedral and whose face she
had not noticed, had quickly raised his hat, with a suppressed
ejaculation.&nbsp; She involuntarily glanced back; the gentleman
had paused, again uncovering, and Captain Jay stood saluting her
in the Italian sunshine.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, good-morning!&rdquo;
she said, and walked on, pursuing her course; her mother was a
little in front.&nbsp; She overtook her in a moment, with an
unreasonable sense, like a gust of cold air, that men were worse
than ever, for Captain Jay had apparently moved into the
church.&nbsp; Her mother turned as they met, and suddenly, as she
looked back, an expression of peculiar sweetness came into this
lady&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp; It made Rose&rsquo;s take the same
direction and rest a second time on Captain Jay, who was planted
just where he had stood a minute before.&nbsp; He immediately
came forward, asking Rose with great gravity if he might speak to
her a moment, while Mrs. Tramore went her way again.&nbsp; He had
the expression of a man who wished to say something very
important; yet his next words were simple enough and consisted of
the remark that he had not seen her for a year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it really so much as that?&rdquo; asked Rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very nearly.&nbsp; I would have looked you up, but in
the first place I have been very little in London, and in the
second I believed it wouldn&rsquo;t have done any
good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should have put that first,&rdquo; said the
girl.&nbsp; &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t have done any
good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was silent over this a moment, in his customary deciphering
way; but the view he took of it did not prevent him from
inquiring, as she slowly followed her mother, if he
mightn&rsquo;t walk with her now.&nbsp; She answered with a laugh
that it wouldn&rsquo;t do any good but that he might do as he
liked.&nbsp; He replied without the slightest manifestation of
levity that it would do more good than if he didn&rsquo;t, and
they strolled together, with Mrs. Tramore well before them,
across the big, amusing piazza, where the front of the cathedral
makes a sort of builded light.&nbsp; He asked a question or two
and he explained his own presence: having a month&rsquo;s
holiday, the first clear time for several years, he had just
popped over the Alps.&nbsp; He inquired if Rose had recent news
of the old lady in Hill Street, and it was the only tortuous
thing she had ever heard him say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have had no communication of any kind from her since
I parted with you under her roof.&nbsp; Hasn&rsquo;t she
mentioned that?&rdquo; said Rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you were such great friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bertram Jay hesitated a moment.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, not so much
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has she done to you?&rdquo; Rose demanded.</p>
<p>He fidgeted a little, as if he were thinking of something that
made him unconscious of her question; then, with mild violence,
he brought out the inquiry: &ldquo;Miss Tramore, are you
happy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was startled by the words, for she on her side had been
reflecting&mdash;reflecting that he had broken with her
grandmother and that this pointed to a reason.&nbsp; It suggested
at least that he wouldn&rsquo;t now be so much like a mouthpiece
for that cold ancestral tone.&nbsp; She turned off his
question&mdash;said it never was a fair one, as you gave yourself
away however you answered it.&nbsp; When he repeated &ldquo;You
give yourself away?&rdquo; as if he didn&rsquo;t understand, she
remembered that he had not read the funny American books.&nbsp;
This brought them to a silence, for she had enlightened him only
by another laugh, and he was evidently preparing another
question, which he wished carefully to disconnect from the
former.&nbsp; Presently, just as they were coming near Mrs.
Tramore, it arrived in the words &ldquo;Is this lady your
mother?&rdquo;&nbsp; On Rose&rsquo;s assenting, with the addition
that she was travelling with her, he said: &ldquo;Will you be so
kind as to introduce me to her?&rdquo;&nbsp; They were so close
to Mrs. Tramore that she probably heard, but she floated away
with a single stroke of her paddle and an inattentive poise of
her head.&nbsp; It was a striking exhibition of the famous tact,
for Rose delayed to answer, which was exactly what might have
made her mother wish to turn; and indeed when at last the girl
spoke she only said to her companion: &ldquo;Why do you ask me
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I desire the pleasure of making her
acquaintance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rose had stopped, and in the middle of the square they stood
looking at each other.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you remember what you said
to me the last time I saw you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t speak of that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s better to speak of it now than to speak of
it later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bertram Jay looked round him, as if to see whether any one
would hear; but the bright foreignness gave him a sense of
safety, and he unexpectedly exclaimed: &ldquo;Miss Tramore, I
love you more than ever!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you ought to have come to see us,&rdquo; declared
the girl, quickly walking on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You treated me the last time as if I were positively
offensive to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I did, but you know my reason.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I protested against the course you were
taking?&nbsp; I did, I did!&rdquo; the young man rang out, as if
he still, a little, stuck to that.</p>
<p>His tone made Rose say gaily: &ldquo;Perhaps you do so
yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell till I&rsquo;ve seen more of your
circumstances,&rdquo; he replied with eminent honesty.</p>
<p>The girl stared; her light laugh filled the air.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s in order to see more of them and judge that
you wish to make my mother&rsquo;s acquaintance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He coloured at this and he evaded; then he broke out with a
confused &ldquo;Miss Tramore, let me stay with you a
little!&rdquo; which made her stop again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your company will do us great honour, but there must be
a rigid condition attached to our acceptance of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kindly mention it,&rdquo; said Captain Jay, staring at
the fa&ccedil;ade of the cathedral.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t take us on trial.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On trial?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t make an observation to me&mdash;not a
single one, ever, ever!&mdash;on the matter that, in Hill Street,
we had our last words about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Jay appeared to be counting the thousand pinnacles of
the church.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think you really must be right,&rdquo;
he remarked at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you are!&rdquo; cried Rose Tramore, and walked
rapidly away.</p>
<p>He caught up with her, he laid his hand upon her arm to stay
her.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re going to Venice, let me go to
Venice with you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t even understand my
condition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re right, then: you must be
right about everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not in the least true, and I don&rsquo;t
care a fig whether you&rsquo;re sure or not.&nbsp; Please let me
go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had barred her way, he kept her longer.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go and speak to your mother myself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even in the midst of another emotion she was amused at the air
of audacity accompanying this declaration.&nbsp; Poor Captain Jay
might have been on the point of marching up to a battery.&nbsp;
She looked at him a moment; then she said: &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be
disappointed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Disappointed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s much more proper than grandmamma, because
she&rsquo;s much more amiable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Miss Tramore&mdash;dear Miss Tramore!&rdquo; the
young man murmured helplessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see for yourself.&nbsp; Only there&rsquo;s
another condition,&rdquo; Rose went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another?&rdquo; he cried, with discouragement and
alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must understand thoroughly, before you throw in
your lot with us even for a few days, what our position really
is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it very bad?&rdquo; asked Bertram Jay artlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one has anything to do with us, no one speaks to us,
no one looks at us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; stared the young man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve no social existence, we&rsquo;re utterly
despised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Miss Tramore!&rdquo; Captain Jay interposed.&nbsp;
He added quickly, vaguely, and with a want of presence of mind of
which he as quickly felt ashamed: &ldquo;Do none of your
family&mdash;?&rdquo;&nbsp; The question collapsed; the brilliant
girl was looking at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re extraordinarily happy,&rdquo; she threw
out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that&rsquo;s all I wanted to know!&rdquo; he
exclaimed, with a kind of exaggerated cheery reproach, walking on
with her briskly to overtake her mother.</p>
<p>He was not dining at their inn, but he insisted on coming that
evening to their <i>table d&rsquo;h&ocirc;te</i>.&nbsp; He sat
next Mrs. Tramore, and in the evening he accompanied them
gallantly to the opera, at a third-rate theatre where they were
almost the only ladies in the boxes.&nbsp; The next day they went
together by rail to the Charterhouse of Pavia, and while he
strolled with the girl, as they waited for the homeward train, he
said to her candidly: &ldquo;Your mother&rsquo;s remarkably
pretty.&rdquo;&nbsp; She remembered the words and the feeling
they gave her: they were the first note of new era.&nbsp; The
feeling was somewhat that of an anxious, gratified matron who has
&ldquo;presented&rdquo; her child and is thinking of the
matrimonial market.&nbsp; Men might be of no use, as Mrs. Tramore
said, yet it was from this moment Rose dated the rosy dawn of her
confidence that her <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;e</i> would go off;
and when later, in crowded assemblies, the phrase, or something
like it behind a hat or a fan, fell repeatedly on her anxious
ear, &ldquo;Your mother <i>is</i> in beauty!&rdquo; or
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen her look better!&rdquo; she had a
faint vision of the yellow sunshine and the afternoon shadows on
the dusty Italian platform.</p>
<p>Mrs. Tramore&rsquo;s behaviour at this period was a revelation
of her native understanding of delicate situations.&nbsp; She
needed no account of this one from her daughter&mdash;it was one
of the things for which she had a scent; and there was a kind of
loyalty to the rules of a game in the silent sweetness with which
she smoothed the path of Bertram Jay.&nbsp; It was clear that she
was in her element in fostering the exercise of the affections,
and if she ever spoke without thinking twice it is probable that
she would have exclaimed, with some gaiety, &ldquo;Oh, I know all
about <i>love</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; Rose could see that she thought
their companion would be a help, in spite of his being no
dispenser of patronage.&nbsp; The key to the gates of fashion had
not been placed in his hand, and no one had ever heard of the
ladies of his family, who lived in some vague hollow of the
Yorkshire moors; but none the less he might administer a muscular
push.&nbsp; Yes indeed, men in general were broken reeds, but
Captain Jay was peculiarly representative.&nbsp; Respectability
was the woman&rsquo;s maximum, as honour was the man&rsquo;s, but
this distinguished young soldier inspired more than one kind of
confidence.&nbsp; Rose had a great deal of attention for the use
to which his respectability was put; and there mingled with this
attention some amusement and much compassion.&nbsp; She saw that
after a couple of days he decidedly liked her mother, and that he
was yet not in the least aware of it.&nbsp; He took for granted
that he believed in her but little; notwithstanding which he
would have trusted her with anything except Rose herself.&nbsp;
His trusting her with Rose would come very soon.&nbsp; He never
spoke to her daughter about her qualities of character, but two
or three of them (and indeed these were all the poor lady had,
and they made the best show) were what he had in mind in praising
her appearance.&nbsp; When he remarked: &ldquo;What attention
Mrs. Tramore seems to attract everywhere!&rdquo; he meant:
&ldquo;What a beautifully simple nature it is!&rdquo; and when he
said: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something extraordinarily harmonious
in the colours she wears,&rdquo; it signified: &ldquo;Upon my
word, I never saw such a sweet temper in my life!&rdquo;&nbsp;
She lost one of her boxes at Verona, and made the prettiest joke
of it to Captain Jay.&nbsp; When Rose saw this she said to
herself, &ldquo;Next season we shall have only to
choose.&rdquo;&nbsp; Rose knew what was in the box.</p>
<p>By the time they reached Venice (they had stopped at half a
dozen little old romantic cities in the most frolicsome
&aelig;sthetic way) she liked their companion better than she had
ever liked him before.&nbsp; She did him the justice to recognise
that if he was not quite honest with himself he was at least
wholly honest with <i>her</i>.&nbsp; She reckoned up everything
he had been since he joined them, and put upon it all an
interpretation so favourable to his devotion that, catching
herself in the act of glossing over one or two episodes that had
not struck her at the time as disinterested she exclaimed,
beneath her breath, &ldquo;Look out&mdash;you&rsquo;re falling in
love!&rdquo;&nbsp; But if he liked correctness wasn&rsquo;t he
quite right?&nbsp; Could any one possibly like it more than
<i>she</i> did?&nbsp; And if he had protested against her
throwing in her lot with her mother, this was not because of the
benefit conferred but because of the injury received.&nbsp; He
exaggerated that injury, but this was the privilege of a lover
perfectly willing to be selfish on behalf of his mistress.&nbsp;
He might have wanted her grandmother&rsquo;s money for her, but
if he had given her up on first discovering that she was throwing
away her chance of it (oh, this was <i>her</i> doing too!) he had
given up her grandmother as much: not keeping well with the old
woman, as some men would have done; not waiting to see how the
perverse experiment would turn out and appeasing her, if it
should promise tolerably, with a view to future operations.&nbsp;
He had had a simple-minded, evangelical, lurid view of what the
girl he loved would find herself in for.&nbsp; She could see this
now&mdash;she could see it from his present bewilderment and
mystification, and she liked him and pitied him, with the kindest
smile, for the original <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i> as well as for
the actual meekness.&nbsp; No wonder he hadn&rsquo;t known what
she was in for, since he now didn&rsquo;t even know what he was
in for himself.&nbsp; Were there not moments when he thought his
companions almost unnaturally good, almost suspiciously
safe?&nbsp; He had lost all power to verify that sketch of their
isolation and <i>d&eacute;classement</i> to which she had treated
him on the great square at Milan.&nbsp; The last thing he noticed
was that they were neglected, and he had never, for himself, had
such an impression of society.</p>
<p>It could scarcely be enhanced even by the apparition of a
large, fair, hot, red-haired young man, carrying a lady&rsquo;s
fan in his hand, who suddenly stood before their little party as,
on the third evening after their arrival in Venice, it partook of
ices at one of the tables before the celebrated Caf&eacute;
Florian.&nbsp; The lamplit Venetian dusk appeared to have
revealed them to this gentleman as he sat with other friends at a
neighbouring table, and he had sprung up, with unsophisticated
glee, to shake hands with Mrs. Tramore and her daughter.&nbsp;
Rose recalled him to her mother, who looked at first as though
she didn&rsquo;t remember him but presently bestowed a
sufficiently gracious smile on Mr. Guy Mangler.&nbsp; He gave
with youthful candour the history of his movements and indicated
the whereabouts of his family: he was with his mother and
sisters; they had met the Bob Veseys, who had taken Lord
Whiteroy&rsquo;s yacht and were going to Constantinople.&nbsp;
His mother and the girls, poor things, were at the Grand Hotel,
but he was on the yacht with the Veseys, where they had Lord
Whiteroy&rsquo;s cook.&nbsp; Wasn&rsquo;t the food in Venice
filthy, and wouldn&rsquo;t they come and look at the yacht?&nbsp;
She wasn&rsquo;t very fast, but she was awfully jolly.&nbsp; His
mother might have come if she would, but she wouldn&rsquo;t at
first, and now, when she wanted to, there were other people, who
naturally wouldn&rsquo;t turn out for her.&nbsp; Mr. Mangler sat
down; he alluded with artless resentment to the way, in July, the
door of his friends had been closed to him.&nbsp; He was going to
Constantinople, but he didn&rsquo;t care&mdash;if <i>they</i>
were going anywhere; meanwhile his mother hoped awfully they
would look her up.</p>
<p>Lady Maresfield, if she had given her son any such message,
which Rose disbelieved, entertained her hope in a manner
compatible with her sitting for half an hour, surrounded by her
little retinue, without glancing in the direction of Mrs.
Tramore.&nbsp; The girl, however, was aware that this was not a
good enough instance of their humiliation; inasmuch as it was
rather she who, on the occasion of their last contact, had held
off from Lady Maresfield.&nbsp; She was a little ashamed now of
not having answered the note in which this affable personage
ignored her mother.&nbsp; She couldn&rsquo;t help perceiving
indeed a dim movement on the part of some of the other members of
the group; she made out an attitude of observation in the
high-plumed head of Mrs. Vaughan-Vesey.&nbsp; Mrs. Vesey,
perhaps, might have been looking at Captain Jay, for as this
gentleman walked back to the hotel with our young lady (they were
at the &ldquo;Britannia,&rdquo; and young Mangler, who clung to
them, went in front with Mrs. Tramore) he revealed to Rose that
he had some acquaintance with Lady Maresfield&rsquo;s eldest
daughter, though he didn&rsquo;t know and didn&rsquo;t
particularly want to know, her ladyship.&nbsp; He expressed
himself with more acerbity than she had ever heard him use
(Christian charity so generally governed his speech) about the
young donkey who had been prattling to them.&nbsp; They separated
at the door of the hotel.&nbsp; Mrs. Tramore had got rid of Mr.
Mangler, and Bertram Jay was in other quarters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you know Mrs. Vesey, why didn&rsquo;t you go and
speak to her?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure she saw you,&rdquo; Rose
said.</p>
<p>Captain Jay replied even more circumspectly than usual.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Because I didn&rsquo;t want to leave you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you can go now; you&rsquo;re free,&rdquo; Rose
rejoined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you.&nbsp; I shall never go again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That won&rsquo;t be civil,&rdquo; said Rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care to be civil.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
like her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you like her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ask too many questions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know I do,&rdquo; the girl acknowledged.</p>
<p>Captain Jay had already shaken hands with her, but at this he
put out his hand again.&nbsp; &ldquo;She&rsquo;s too
worldly,&rdquo; he murmured, while he held Rose Tramore&rsquo;s a
moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, you dear!&rdquo; Rose exclaimed almost audibly as,
with her mother, she turned away.</p>
<p>The next morning, upon the Grand Canal, the gondola of our
three friends encountered a stately barge which, though it
contained several persons, seemed pervaded mainly by one majestic
presence.&nbsp; During the instant the gondolas were passing each
other it was impossible either for Rose Tramore or for her
companions not to become conscious that this distinguished
identity had markedly inclined itself&mdash;a circumstance
commemorated the next moment, almost within earshot of the other
boat, by the most spontaneous cry that had issued for many a day
from the lips of Mrs. Tramore.&nbsp; &ldquo;Fancy, my dear, Lady
Maresfield has bowed to us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to have returned it,&rdquo; Rose answered; but
she looked at Bertram Jay, who was opposite to her.&nbsp; He
blushed, and she blushed, and during this moment was born a
deeper understanding than had yet existed between these
associated spirits.&nbsp; It had something to do with their going
together that afternoon, without her mother, to look at certain
out-of-the-way pictures as to which Ruskin had inspired her with
a desire to see sincerely.&nbsp; Mrs. Tramore expressed the wish
to stay at home, and the motive of this wish&mdash;a finer shade
than any that even Ruskin had ever found a phrase for&mdash;was
not translated into misrepresenting words by either the mother or
the daughter.&nbsp; At San Giovanni in Bragora the girl and her
companion came upon Mrs. Vaughan-Vesey, who, with one of her
sisters, was also endeavouring to do the earnest thing.&nbsp; She
did it to Rose, she did it to Captain Jay, as well as to
Gianbellini; she was a handsome, long-necked, aquiline person, of
a different type from the rest of her family, and she did it
remarkably well.&nbsp; She secured our friends&mdash;it was her
own expression&mdash;for luncheon, on the morrow, on the yacht,
and she made it public to Rose that she would come that afternoon
to invite her mother.&nbsp; When the girl returned to the hotel,
Mrs. Tramore mentioned, before Captain Jay, who had come up to
their sitting-room, that Lady Maresfield had called.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She stayed a long time&mdash;at least it seemed
long!&rdquo; laughed Mrs. Tramore.</p>
<p>The poor lady could laugh freely now; yet there was some
grimness in a colloquy that she had with her daughter after
Bertram Jay had departed.&nbsp; Before this happened Mrs.
Vesey&rsquo;s card, scrawled over in pencil and referring to the
morrow&rsquo;s luncheon, was brought up to Mrs. Tramore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They mean it all as a bribe,&rdquo; said the principal
recipient of these civilities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a bribe?&rdquo; Rose repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She wants to marry you to that boy; they&rsquo;ve seen
Captain Jay and they&rsquo;re frightened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, dear mamma, I can&rsquo;t take Mr. Mangler for a
husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not.&nbsp; But oughtn&rsquo;t we to go to the
luncheon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly we&rsquo;ll go to the luncheon,&rdquo; Rose
said; and when the affair took place, on the morrow, she could
feel for the first time that she was taking her mother out.&nbsp;
This appearance was somehow brought home to every one else, and
it was really the agent of her success.&nbsp; For it is of the
essence of this simple history that, in the first place, that
success dated from Mrs. Vesey&rsquo;s Venetian
<i>d&eacute;jeuner</i>, and in the second reposed, by a subtle
social logic, on the very anomaly that had made it dubious.&nbsp;
There is always a chance in things, and Rose Tramore&rsquo;s
chance was in the fact that Gwendolen Vesey was, as some one had
said, awfully modern, an immense improvement on the exploded
science of her mother, and capable of seeing what a
&ldquo;draw&rdquo; there would be in the comedy, if properly
brought out, of the reversed positions of Mrs. Tramore and Mrs.
Tramore&rsquo;s diplomatic daughter.&nbsp; With a first-rate
managerial eye she perceived that people would flock into any
room&mdash;and all the more into one of hers&mdash;to see Rose
bring in her dreadful mother.&nbsp; She treated the cream of
English society to this thrilling spectacle later in the autumn,
when she once more &ldquo;secured&rdquo; both the performers for
a week at Brimble.&nbsp; It made a hit on the spot, the very
first evening&mdash;the girl was felt to play her part so
well.&nbsp; The rumour of the performance spread; every one
wanted to see it.&nbsp; It was an entertainment of which, that
winter in the country, and the next season in town, persons of
taste desired to give their friends the freshness.&nbsp; The
thing was to make the Tramores come late, after every one had
arrived.&nbsp; They were engaged for a fixed hour, like the
American imitator and the Patagonian contralto.&nbsp; Mrs. Vesey
had been the first to say the girl was awfully original, but that
became the general view.</p>
<p>Gwendolen Vesey had with her mother one of the few quarrels in
which Lady Maresfield had really stood up to such an antagonist
(the elder woman had to recognise in general in whose veins it
was that the blood of the Manglers flowed) on account of this
very circumstance of her attaching more importance to Miss
Tramore&rsquo;s originality (&ldquo;Her originality be
hanged!&rdquo; her ladyship had gone so far as unintelligently to
exclaim) than to the prospects of the unfortunate Guy.&nbsp; Mrs.
Vesey actually lost sight of these pressing problems in her
admiration of the way the mother and the daughter, or rather the
daughter and the mother (it was slightly confusing)
&ldquo;drew.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was Lady Maresfield&rsquo;s version
of the case that the brazen girl (she was shockingly coarse) had
treated poor Guy abominably.&nbsp; At any rate it was made known,
just after Easter, that Miss Tramore was to be married to Captain
Jay.&nbsp; The marriage was not to take place till the summer;
but Rose felt that before this the field would practically be
won.&nbsp; There had been some bad moments, there had been
several warm corners and a certain number of cold shoulders and
closed doors and stony stares; but the breach was effectually
made&mdash;the rest was only a question of time.&nbsp; Mrs.
Tramore could be trusted to keep what she had gained, and it was
the dowagers, the old dragons with prominent fangs and glittering
scales, whom the trick had already mainly caught.&nbsp; By this
time there were several houses into which the liberated lady had
crept alone.&nbsp; Her daughter had been expected with her, but
they couldn&rsquo;t turn her out because the girl had stayed
behind, and she was fast acquiring a new identity, that of a
parental connection with the heroine of such a romantic
story.&nbsp; She was at least the next best thing to her
daughter, and Rose foresaw the day when she would be valued
principally as a memento of one of the prettiest episodes in the
annals of London.&nbsp; At a big official party, in June, Rose
had the joy of introducing Eric to his mother.&nbsp; She was a
little sorry it was an official party&mdash;there were some other
such queer people there; but Eric called, observing the shade,
the next day but one.</p>
<p>No observer, probably, would have been acute enough to fix
exactly the moment at which the girl ceased to take out her
mother and began to be taken out by her.&nbsp; A later phase was
more distinguishable&mdash;that at which Rose forbore to inflict
on her companion a duality that might become oppressive.&nbsp;
She began to economise her force, she went only when the
particular effect was required.&nbsp; Her marriage was delayed by
the period of mourning consequent upon the death of her
grandmother, who, the younger Mrs. Tramore averred, was killed by
the rumour of her own new birth.&nbsp; She was the only one of
the dragons who had not been tamed.&nbsp; Julia Tramore knew the
truth about this&mdash;she was determined such things should not
kill <i>her</i>.&nbsp; She would live to do something&mdash;she
hardly knew what.&nbsp; The provisions of her mother&rsquo;s will
were published in the &ldquo;Illustrated News&rdquo;; from which
it appeared that everything that was not to go to Eric and to
Julia was to go to the fortunate Edith.&nbsp; Miss Tramore makes
no secret of her own intentions as regards this favourite.</p>
<p>Edith is not pretty, but Lady Maresfield is waiting for her;
she is determined Gwendolen Vesey shall not get hold of
her.&nbsp; Mrs. Vesey however takes no interest in her at
all.&nbsp; She is whimsical, as befits a woman of her fashion;
but there are two persons she is still very fond of, the
delightful Bertram Jays.&nbsp; The fondness of this pair, it must
be added, is not wholly expended in return.&nbsp; They are
extremely united, but their life is more domestic than might have
been expected from the preliminary signs.&nbsp; It owes a portion
of its concentration to the fact that Mrs. Tramore has now so
many places to go to that she has almost no time to come to her
daughter&rsquo;s.&nbsp; She is, under her son-in-law&rsquo;s
roof, a brilliant but a rare apparition, and the other day he
remarked upon the circumstance to his wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it hadn&rsquo;t been for you,&rdquo; she replied,
smiling, &ldquo;she might have had her regular place at our
fireside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good heavens, how did I prevent it?&rdquo; cried
Captain Jay, with all the consciousness of virtue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ordered it otherwise, you goose!&rdquo;&nbsp; And
she says, in the same spirit, whenever her husband commends her
(which he does, sometimes, extravagantly) for the way she
launched her mother: &ldquo;Nonsense, my dear&mdash;practically
it was <i>you</i>!&rdquo;</p>

249</span>GREVILLE FANE.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Coming</span> in to dress for dinner, I
found a telegram: &ldquo;Mrs. Stormer dying; can you give us half
a column for to-morrow evening?&nbsp; Let her off easy, but not
too easy.&rdquo;&nbsp; I was late; I was in a hurry; I had very
little time to think, but at a venture I dispatched a reply:
&ldquo;Will do what I can.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was not till I had
dressed and was rolling away to dinner that, in the hansom, I
bethought myself of the difficulty of the condition
attached.&nbsp; The difficulty was not of course in letting her
off easy but in qualifying that indulgence.&nbsp; &ldquo;I simply
won&rsquo;t qualify it,&rdquo; I said to myself.&nbsp; I
didn&rsquo;t admire her, but I liked her, and I had known her so
long that I almost felt heartless in sitting down at such an hour
to a feast of indifference.&nbsp; I must have seemed abstracted,
for the early years of my acquaintance with her came back to
me.&nbsp; I spoke of her to the lady I had taken down, but the
lady I had taken down had never heard of Greville Fane.&nbsp; I
tried my other neighbour, who pronounced her books &ldquo;too
vile.&rdquo;&nbsp; I had never thought them very good, but I
should let her off easier than that.</p>
<p>I came away early, for the express purpose of driving to ask
about her.&nbsp; The journey took time, for she lived in the
north-west district, in the neighbourhood of Primrose Hill.&nbsp;
My apprehension that I should be too late was justified in a
fuller sense than I had attached to it&mdash;I had only feared
that the house would be shut up.&nbsp; There were lights in the
windows, and the temperate tinkle of my bell brought a servant
immediately to the door, but poor Mrs. Stormer had passed into a
state in which the resonance of no earthly knocker was to be
feared.&nbsp; A lady, in the hall, hovering behind the servant,
came forward when she heard my voice.&nbsp; I recognised Lady
Luard, but she had mistaken me for the doctor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse my appearing at such an hour,&rdquo; I said;
&ldquo;it was the first possible moment after I heard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all over,&rdquo; Lady Luard replied.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Dearest mamma!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stood there under the lamp with her eyes on me; she was
very tall, very stiff, very cold, and always looked as if these
things, and some others beside, in her dress, her manner and even
her name, were an implication that she was very admirable.&nbsp;
I had never been able to follow the argument, but that is a
detail.&nbsp; I expressed briefly and frankly what I felt, while
the little mottled maidservant flattened herself against the wall
of the narrow passage and tried to look detached without looking
indifferent.&nbsp; It was not a moment to make a visit, and I was
on the point of retreating when Lady Luard arrested me with a
queer, casual, drawling &ldquo;Would you&mdash;a&mdash;would you,
perhaps, be <i>writing</i> something?&rdquo;&nbsp; I felt for the
instant like an interviewer, which I was not.&nbsp; But I pleaded
guilty to this intention, on which she rejoined: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
so very glad&mdash;but I think my brother would like to see
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; I detested her brother, but it wasn&rsquo;t an
occasion to act this out; so I suffered myself to be inducted, to
my surprise, into a small back room which I immediately
recognised as the scene, during the later years, of Mrs.
Stormer&rsquo;s imperturbable industry.&nbsp; Her table was
there, the battered and blotted accessory to innumerable literary
lapses, with its contracted space for the arms (she wrote only
from the elbow down) and the confusion of scrappy, scribbled
sheets which had already become literary remains.&nbsp; Leolin
was also there, smoking a cigarette before the fire and looking
impudent even in his grief, sincere as it well might have
been.</p>
<p>To meet him, to greet him, I had to make a sharp effort; for
the air that he wore to me as he stood before me was quite that
of his mother&rsquo;s murderer.&nbsp; She lay silent for ever
upstairs&mdash;as dead as an unsuccessful book, and his
swaggering erectness was a kind of symbol of his having killed
her.&nbsp; I wondered if he had already, with his sister, been
calculating what they could get for the poor papers on the table;
but I had not long to wait to learn, for in reply to the scanty
words of sympathy I addressed him he puffed out:
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s miserable, miserable, yes; but she has left
three books complete.&rdquo;&nbsp; His words had the oddest
effect; they converted the cramped little room into a seat of
trade and made the &ldquo;book&rdquo; wonderfully feasible.&nbsp;
He would certainly get all that could be got for the three.&nbsp;
Lady Luard explained to me that her husband had been with them
but had had to go down to the House.&nbsp; To her brother she
explained that I was going to write something, and to me again
she made it clear that she hoped I would &ldquo;do mamma
justice.&rdquo;&nbsp; She added that she didn&rsquo;t think this
had ever been done.&nbsp; She said to her brother:
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think there are some things he ought
thoroughly to understand?&rdquo; and on his instantly exclaiming
&ldquo;Oh, thoroughly&mdash;thoroughly!&rdquo; she went on,
rather austerely: &ldquo;I mean about mamma&rsquo;s
birth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and her connections,&rdquo; Leolin added.</p>
<p>I professed every willingness, and for five minutes I
listened, but it would be too much to say that I
understood.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t even now, but it is not
important.&nbsp; My vision was of other matters than those they
put before me, and while they desired there should be no mistake
about their ancestors I became more and more lucid about
themselves.&nbsp; I got away as soon as possible, and walked home
through the great dusky, empty London&mdash;the best of all
conditions for thought.&nbsp; By the time I reached my door my
little article was practically composed&mdash;ready to be
transferred on the morrow from the polished plate of fancy.&nbsp;
I believe it attracted some notice, was thought
&ldquo;graceful&rdquo; and was said to be by some one else.&nbsp;
I had to be pointed without being lively, and it took some
tact.&nbsp; But what I said was much less interesting than what I
thought&mdash;especially during the half-hour I spent in my
armchair by the fire, smoking the cigar I always light before
going to bed.&nbsp; I went to sleep there, I believe; but I
continued to moralise about Greville Fane.&nbsp; I am reluctant
to lose that retrospect altogether, and this is a dim little
memory of it, a document not to &ldquo;serve.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
dear woman had written a hundred stories, but none so curious as
her own.</p>
<p>When first I knew her she had published half-a-dozen fictions,
and I believe I had also perpetrated a novel.&nbsp; She was more
than a dozen years older than I, but she was a person who always
acknowledged her relativity.&nbsp; It was not so very long ago,
but in London, amid the big waves of the present, even a near
horizon gets hidden.&nbsp; I met her at some dinner and took her
down, rather flattered at offering my arm to a celebrity.&nbsp;
She didn&rsquo;t look like one, with her matronly, mild,
inanimate face, but I supposed her greatness would come out in
her conversation.&nbsp; I gave it all the opportunities I could,
but I was not disappointed when I found her only a dull, kind
woman.&nbsp; This was why I liked her&mdash;she rested me so from
literature.&nbsp; To myself literature was an irritation, a
torment; but Greville Fane slumbered in the intellectual part of
it like a Creole in a hammock.&nbsp; She was not a woman of
genius, but her faculty was so special, so much a gift out of
hand, that I have often wondered why she fell below that
distinction.&nbsp; This was doubtless because the transaction, in
her case, had remained incomplete; genius always pays for the
gift, feels the debt, and she was placidly unconscious of
obligation.&nbsp; She could invent stories by the yard, but she
couldn&rsquo;t write a page of English.&nbsp; She went down to
her grave without suspecting that though she had contributed
volumes to the diversion of her contemporaries she had not
contributed a sentence to the language.&nbsp; This had not
prevented bushels of criticism from being heaped upon her head;
she was worth a couple of columns any day to the weekly papers,
in which it was shown that her pictures of life were dreadful but
her style really charming.&nbsp; She asked me to come and see
her, and I went.&nbsp; She lived then in Montpellier Square;
which helped me to see how dissociated her imagination was from
her character.</p>
<p>An industrious widow, devoted to her daily stint, to meeting
the butcher and baker and making a home for her son and daughter,
from the moment she took her pen in her hand she became a
creature of passion.&nbsp; She thought the English novel
deplorably wanting in that element, and the task she had cut out
for herself was to supply the deficiency.&nbsp; Passion in high
life was the general formula of this work, for her imagination
was at home only in the most exalted circles.&nbsp; She adored,
in truth, the aristocracy, and they constituted for her the
romance of the world or, what is more to the point, the prime
material of fiction.&nbsp; Their beauty and luxury, their loves
and revenges, their temptations and surrenders, their
immoralities and diamonds were as familiar to her as the blots on
her writing-table.&nbsp; She was not a belated producer of the
old fashionable novel, she had a cleverness and a modernness of
her own, she had freshened up the fly-blown tinsel.&nbsp; She
turned off plots by the hundred and&mdash;so far as her flying
quill could convey her&mdash;was perpetually going abroad.&nbsp;
Her types, her illustrations, her tone were nothing if not
cosmopolitan.&nbsp; She recognised nothing less provincial than
European society, and her fine folk knew each other and made love
to each other from Doncaster to Bucharest.&nbsp; She had an idea
that she resembled Balzac, and her favourite historical
characters were Lucien de Rubempr&eacute; and the Vidame de
Pamiers.&nbsp; I must add that when I once asked her who the
latter personage was she was unable to tell me.&nbsp; She was
very brave and healthy and cheerful, very abundant and innocent
and wicked.&nbsp; She was clever and vulgar and snobbish, and
never so intensely British as when she was particularly
foreign.</p>
<p>This combination of qualities had brought her early success,
and I remember having heard with wonder and envy of what she
&ldquo;got,&rdquo; in those days, for a novel.&nbsp; The
revelation gave me a pang: it was such a proof that, practising a
totally different style, I should never make my fortune.&nbsp;
And yet when, as I knew her better she told me her real tariff
and I saw how rumour had quadrupled it, I liked her enough to be
sorry.&nbsp; After a while I discovered too that if she got less
it was not that <i>I</i> was to get any more.&nbsp; My failure
never had what Mrs. Stormer would have called the banality of
being relative&mdash;it was always admirably absolute.&nbsp; She
lived at ease however in those days&mdash;ease is exactly the
word, though she produced three novels a year.&nbsp; She scorned
me when I spoke of difficulty&mdash;it was the only thing that
made her angry.&nbsp; If I hinted that a work of art required a
tremendous licking into shape she thought it a pretension and a
<i>pose</i>.&nbsp; She never recognised the &ldquo;torment of
form&rdquo;; the furthest she went was to introduce into one of
her books (in satire her hand was heavy) a young poet who was
always talking about it.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t quite understand
her irritation on this score, for she had nothing at stake in the
matter.&nbsp; She had a shrewd perception that form, in prose at
least, never recommended any one to the public we were condemned
to address, and therefore she lost nothing (putting her private
humiliation aside) by not having any.&nbsp; She made no pretence
of producing works of art, but had comfortable tea-drinking hours
in which she freely confessed herself a common pastrycook,
dealing in such tarts and puddings as would bring customers to
the shop.&nbsp; She put in plenty of sugar and of cochineal, or
whatever it is that gives these articles a rich and attractive
colour.&nbsp; She had a serene superiority to observation and
opportunity which constituted an inexpugnable strength and would
enable her to go on indefinitely.&nbsp; It is only real success
that wanes, it is only solid things that melt.&nbsp; Greville
Fane&rsquo;s ignorance of life was a resource still more
unfailing than the most approved receipt.&nbsp; On her saying
once that the day would come when she should have written herself
out I answered: &ldquo;Ah, you look into fairyland, and the
fairies love you, and <i>they</i> never change.&nbsp; Fairyland
is always there; it always was from the beginning of time, and it
always will be to the end.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ve given you the key
and you can always open the door.&nbsp; With me it&rsquo;s
different; I try, in my clumsy way, to be in some direct relation
to life.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, bother your direct relation to
life!&rdquo; she used to reply, for she was always annoyed by the
phrase&mdash;which would not in the least prevent her from using
it when she wished to try for style.&nbsp; With no more
prejudices than an old sausage-mill, she would give forth again
with patient punctuality any poor verbal scrap that had been
dropped into her.&nbsp; I cheered her with saying that the dark
day, at the end, would be for the like of <i>me</i>; inasmuch as,
going in our small way by experience and observation, we depended
not on a revelation, but on a little tiresome process.&nbsp;
Observation depended on opportunity, and where should we be when
opportunity failed?</p>
<p>One day she told me that as the novelist&rsquo;s life was so
delightful and during the good years at least such a comfortable
support (she had these staggering optimisms) she meant to train
up her boy to follow it.&nbsp; She took the ingenious view that
it was a profession like another and that therefore everything
was to be gained by beginning young and serving an
apprenticeship.&nbsp; Moreover the education would be less
expensive than any other special course, inasmuch as she could
administer it herself.&nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t profess to keep a
school, but she could at least teach her own child.&nbsp; It was
not that she was so very clever, but (she confessed to me as if
she were afraid I would laugh at her) that <i>he</i> was.&nbsp; I
didn&rsquo;t laugh at her for that, for I thought the boy
sharp&mdash;I had seen him at sundry times.&nbsp; He was well
grown and good-looking and unabashed, and both he and his sister
made me wonder about their defunct papa, concerning whom the
little I knew was that he had been a clergyman.&nbsp; I explained
them to myself by suppositions and imputations possibly unjust to
the departed; so little were they&mdash;superficially at
least&mdash;the children of their mother.&nbsp; There used to be,
on an easel in her drawing-room, an enlarged photograph of her
husband, done by some horrible posthumous &ldquo;process&rdquo;
and draped, as to its florid frame, with a silken scarf, which
testified to the candour of Greville Fane&rsquo;s bad
taste.&nbsp; It made him look like an unsuccessful tragedian; but
it was not a thing to trust.&nbsp; He may have been a successful
comedian.&nbsp; Of the two children the girl was the elder, and
struck me in all her younger years as singularly
colourless.&nbsp; She was only very long, like an undecipherable
letter.&nbsp; It was not till Mrs. Stormer came back from a
protracted residence abroad that Ethel (which was this young
lady&rsquo;s name) began to produce the effect, which was
afterwards remarkable in her, of a certain kind of high
resolution.&nbsp; She made one apprehend that she meant to do
something for herself.&nbsp; She was long-necked and near-sighted
and striking, and I thought I had never seen sweet seventeen in a
form so hard and high and dry.&nbsp; She was cold and affected
and ambitious, and she carried an eyeglass with a long handle,
which she put up whenever she wanted not to see.&nbsp; She had
come out, as the phrase is, immensely; and yet I felt as if she
were surrounded with a spiked iron railing.&nbsp; What she meant
to do for herself was to marry, and it was the only thing, I
think, that she meant to do for any one else; yet who would be
inspired to clamber over that bristling barrier?&nbsp; What
flower of tenderness or of intimacy would such an adventurer
conceive as his reward?</p>
<p>This was for Sir Baldwin Luard to say; but he naturally never
confided to me the secret.&nbsp; He was a joyless, jokeless young
man, with the air of having other secrets as well, and a
determination to get on politically that was indicated by his
never having been known to commit himself&mdash;as regards any
proposition whatever&mdash;beyond an exclamatory
&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;&nbsp; His wife and he must have conversed
mainly in prim ejaculations, but they understood sufficiently
that they were kindred spirits.&nbsp; I remember being angry with
Greville Fane when she announced these nuptials to me as
magnificent; I remember asking her what splendour there was in
the union of the daughter of a woman of genius with an
irredeemable mediocrity.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh! he&rsquo;s awfully
clever,&rdquo; she said; but she blushed for the maternal
fib.&nbsp; What she meant was that though Sir Baldwin&rsquo;s
estates were not vast (he had a dreary house in South Kensington
and a still drearier &ldquo;Hall&rdquo; somewhere in Essex, which
was let), the connection was a &ldquo;smarter&rdquo; one than a
child of hers could have aspired to form.&nbsp; In spite of the
social bravery of her novels she took a very humble and dingy
view of herself, so that of all her productions &ldquo;my
daughter Lady Luard&rdquo; was quite the one she was proudest
of.&nbsp; That personage thought her mother very vulgar and was
distressed and perplexed by the occasional license of her pen,
but had a complicated attitude in regard to this indirect
connection with literature.&nbsp; So far as it was lucrative her
ladyship approved of it, and could compound with the inferiority
of the pursuit by doing practical justice to some of its
advantages.&nbsp; I had reason to know (my reason was simply that
poor Mrs. Stormer told me) that she suffered the inky fingers to
press an occasional bank-note into her palm.&nbsp; On the other
hand she deplored the &ldquo;peculiar style&rdquo; to which
Greville Fane had devoted herself, and wondered where an author
who had the convenience of so lady-like a daughter could have
picked up such views about the best society.&nbsp; &ldquo;She
might know better, with Leolin and me,&rdquo; Lady Luard had been
known to remark; but it appeared that some of Greville
Fane&rsquo;s superstitions were incurable.&nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t
live in Lady Luard&rsquo;s society, and the best was not good
enough for her&mdash;she must make it still better.</p>
<p>I could see that this necessity grew upon her during the years
she spent abroad, when I had glimpses of her in the shifting
sojourns that lay in the path of my annual ramble.&nbsp; She
betook herself from Germany to Switzerland and from Switzerland
to Italy; she favoured cheap places and set up her desk in the
smaller capitals.&nbsp; I took a look at her whenever I could,
and I always asked how Leolin was getting on.&nbsp; She gave me
beautiful accounts of him, and whenever it was possible the boy
was produced for my edification.&nbsp; I had entered from the
first into the joke of his career&mdash;I pretended to regard him
as a consecrated child.&nbsp; It had been a joke for Mrs. Stormer
at first, but the boy himself had been shrewd enough to make the
matter serious.&nbsp; If his mother accepted the principle that
the intending novelist cannot begin too early to see life, Leolin
was not interested in hanging back from the application of
it.&nbsp; He was eager to qualify himself, and took to cigarettes
at ten, on the highest literary grounds.&nbsp; His poor mother
gazed at him with extravagant envy and, like Desdemona, wished
heaven had made <i>her</i> such a man.&nbsp; She explained to me
more than once that in her profession she had found her sex a
dreadful drawback.&nbsp; She loved the story of Madame George
Sand&rsquo;s early rebellion against this hindrance, and believed
that if she had worn trousers she could have written as well as
that lady.&nbsp; Leolin had for the career at least the
qualification of trousers, and as he grew older he recognised its
importance by laying in an immense assortment.&nbsp; He grew up
in gorgeous apparel, which was his way of interpreting his
mother&rsquo;s system.&nbsp; Whenever I met her I found her still
under the impression that she was carrying this system out and
that Leolin&rsquo;s training was bearing fruit.&nbsp; She was
giving him experience, she was giving him impressions, she was
putting a <i>gagnepain</i> into his hand.&nbsp; It was another
name for spoiling him with the best conscience in the
world.&nbsp; The queerest pictures come back to me of this period
of the good lady&rsquo;s life and of the extraordinarily
virtuous, muddled, bewildering tenor of it.&nbsp; She had an idea
that she was seeing foreign manners as well as her petticoats
would allow; but, in reality she was not seeing anything, least
of all fortunately how much she was laughed at.&nbsp; She drove
her whimsical pen at Dresden and at Florence, and produced in all
places and at all times the same romantic and ridiculous
fictions.&nbsp; She carried about her box of properties and
fished out promptly the familiar, tarnished old puppets.&nbsp;
She believed in them when others couldn&rsquo;t, and as they were
like nothing that was to be seen under the sun it was impossible
to prove by comparison that they were wrong.&nbsp; You
can&rsquo;t compare birds and fishes; you could only feel that,
as Greville Fane&rsquo;s characters had the fine plumage of the
former species, human beings must be of the latter.</p>
<p>It would have been droll if it had not been so exemplary to
see her tracing the loves of the duchesses beside the innocent
cribs of her children.&nbsp; The immoral and the maternal lived
together in her diligent days on the most comfortable terms, and
she stopped curling the mustaches of her Guardsmen to pat the
heads of her babes.&nbsp; She was haunted by solemn spinsters who
came to tea from continental <i>pensions</i>, and by
unsophisticated Americans who told her she was just loved in
<i>their</i> country.&nbsp; &ldquo;I had rather be just paid
there,&rdquo; she usually replied; for this tribute of
transatlantic opinion was the only thing that galled her.&nbsp;
The Americans went away thinking her coarse; though as the author
of so many beautiful love-stories she was disappointing to most
of these pilgrims, who had not expected to find a shy, stout,
ruddy lady in a cap like a crumbled pyramid.&nbsp; She wrote
about the affections and the impossibility of controlling them,
but she talked of the price of <i>pension</i> and the convenience
of an English chemist.&nbsp; She devoted much thought and many
thousands of francs to the education of her daughter, who spent
three years at a very superior school at Dresden, receiving
wonderful instruction in sciences, arts and tongues, and who,
taking a different line from Leolin, was to be brought up wholly
as a <i>femme du monde</i>.&nbsp; The girl was musical and
philological; she made a specialty of languages and learned
enough about them to be inspired with a great contempt for her
mother&rsquo;s artless accents.&nbsp; Greville Fane&rsquo;s
French and Italian were droll; the imitative faculty had been
denied her, and she had an unequalled gift, especially pen in
hand, of squeezing big mistakes into small opportunities.&nbsp;
She knew it, but she didn&rsquo;t care; correctness was the
virtue in the world that, like her heroes and heroines, she
valued least.&nbsp; Ethel, who had perceived in her pages some
remarkable lapses, undertook at one time to revise her proofs;
but I remember her telling me a year after the girl had left
school that this function had been very briefly exercised.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She can&rsquo;t read me,&rdquo; said Mrs. Stormer;
&ldquo;I offend her taste.&nbsp; She tells me that at
Dresden&mdash;at school&mdash;I was never allowed.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The good lady seemed surprised at this, having the best
conscience in the world about her lucubrations.&nbsp; She had
never meant to fly in the face of anything, and considered that
she grovelled before the Rhadamanthus of the English literary
tribunal, the celebrated and awful Young Person.&nbsp; I assured
her, as a joke, that she was frightfully indecent (she
hadn&rsquo;t in fact that reality any more than any other) my
purpose being solely to prevent her from guessing that her
daughter had dropped her not because she was immoral but because
she was vulgar.&nbsp; I used to figure her children closeted
together and asking each other while they exchanged a gaze of
dismay: &ldquo;Why should she <i>be</i> so&mdash;and so
<i>fearfully</i> so&mdash;when she has the advantage of our
society?&nbsp; Shouldn&rsquo;t <i>we</i> have taught her
better?&rdquo;&nbsp; Then I imagined their recognising with a
blush and a shrug that she was unteachable, irreformable.&nbsp;
Indeed she was, poor lady; but it is never fair to read by the
light of taste things that were not written by it.&nbsp; Greville
Fane had, in the topsy-turvy, a serene good faith that ought to
have been safe from allusion, like a stutter or a <i>faux
pas</i>.</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t make her son ashamed of the profession to
which he was destined, however; she only made him ashamed of the
way she herself exercised it.&nbsp; But he bore his humiliation
much better than his sister, for he was ready to take for granted
that he should one day restore the balance.&nbsp; He was a canny
and far-seeing youth, with appetites and aspirations, and he had
not a scruple in his composition.&nbsp; His mother&rsquo;s theory
of the happy knack he could pick up deprived him of the wholesome
discipline required to prevent young idlers from becoming
cads.&nbsp; He had, abroad, a casual tutor and a snatch or two of
a Swiss school, but no consecutive study, no prospect of a
university or a degree.&nbsp; It may be imagined with what zeal,
as the years went on, he entered into the pleasantry of there
being no manual so important to him as the massive book of
life.&nbsp; It was an expensive volume to peruse, but Mrs.
Stormer was willing to lay out a sum in what she would have
called her <i>premiers frais</i>.&nbsp; Ethel
disapproved&mdash;she thought this education far too
unconventional for an English gentleman.&nbsp; Her voice was for
Eton and Oxford, or for any public school (she would have
resigned herself) with the army to follow.&nbsp; But Leolin never
was afraid of his sister, and they visibly disliked, though they
sometimes agreed to assist, each other.&nbsp; They could combine
to work the oracle&mdash;to keep their mother at her desk.</p>
<p>When she came back to England, telling me she had got all the
continent could give her, Leolin was a broad-shouldered,
red-faced young man, with an immense wardrobe and an
extraordinary assurance of manner.&nbsp; She was fondly obstinate
about her having taken the right course with him, and proud of
all that he knew and had seen.&nbsp; He was now quite ready to
begin, and a little while later she told me he <i>had</i>
begun.&nbsp; He had written something tremendously clever, and it
was coming out in the <i>Cheapside</i>.&nbsp; I believe it came
out; I had no time to look for it; I never heard anything about
it.&nbsp; I took for granted that if this contribution had passed
through his mother&rsquo;s hands it had practically become a
specimen of her own genius, and it was interesting to consider
Mrs. Stormer&rsquo;s future in the light of her having to write
her son&rsquo;s novels as well as her own.&nbsp; This was not the
way she looked at it herself; she took the charming ground that
he would help her to write hers.&nbsp; She used to tell me that
he supplied passages of the greatest value to her own
work&mdash;all sorts of technical things, about hunting and
yachting and wine&mdash;that she couldn&rsquo;t be expected to
get very straight.&nbsp; It was all so much practice for him and
so much alleviation for her.&nbsp; I was unable to identify these
pages, for I had long since ceased to &ldquo;keep up&rdquo; with
Greville Fane; but I was quite able to believe that the
wine-question had been put, by Leolin&rsquo;s good offices, on a
better footing, for the dear lady used to mix her drinks (she was
perpetually serving the most splendid suppers) in the queerest
fashion.&nbsp; I could see that he was willing enough to accept a
commission to look after that department.&nbsp; It occurred to me
indeed, when Mrs. Stormer settled in England again, that by
making a shrewd use of both her children she might be able to
rejuvenate her style.&nbsp; Ethel had come back to gratify her
young ambition, and if she couldn&rsquo;t take her mother into
society she would at least go into it herself.&nbsp; Silently,
stiffly, almost grimly, this young lady held up her head,
clenched her long teeth, squared her lean elbows and made her way
up the staircases she had elected.&nbsp; The only communication
she ever made to me, the only effusion of confidence with which
she ever honoured me, was when she said: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
want to know the people mamma knows; I mean to know
others.&rdquo;&nbsp; I took due note of the remark, for I was not
one of the &ldquo;others.&rdquo;&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t trace
therefore the steps of her process; I could only admire it at a
distance and congratulate her mother on the results.&nbsp; The
results were that Ethel went to &ldquo;big&rdquo; parties and got
people to take her.&nbsp; Some of them were people she had met
abroad, and others were people whom the people she had met abroad
had met.&nbsp; They ministered alike to Miss Ethel&rsquo;s
convenience, and I wondered how she extracted so many favours
without the expenditure of a smile.&nbsp; Her smile was the
dimmest thing in the world, diluted lemonade, without sugar, and
she had arrived precociously at social wisdom, recognising that
if she was neither pretty enough nor rich enough nor clever
enough, she could at least in her muscular youth be rude
enough.&nbsp; Therefore if she was able to tell her mother what
really took place in the mansions of the great, give her notes to
work from, the quill could be driven at home to better purpose
and precisely at a moment when it would have to be more active
than ever.&nbsp; But if she did tell, it would appear that poor
Mrs. Stormer didn&rsquo;t believe.&nbsp; As regards many points
this was not a wonder; at any rate I heard nothing of Greville
Fane&rsquo;s having developed a new manner.&nbsp; She had only
one manner from start to finish, as Leolin would have said.</p>
<p>She was tired at last, but she mentioned to me that she
couldn&rsquo;t afford to pause.&nbsp; She continued to speak of
Leolin&rsquo;s work as the great hope of their future (she had
saved no money) though the young man wore to my sense an aspect
more and more professional if you like, but less and less
literary.&nbsp; At the end of a couple of years there was
something monstrous in the impudence with which he played his
part in the comedy.&nbsp; When I wondered how she could play
<i>her</i> part I had to perceive that her good faith was
complete and that what kept it so was simply her extravagant
fondness.&nbsp; She loved the young impostor with a simple,
blind, benighted love, and of all the heroes of romance who had
passed before her eyes he was by far the most brilliant.</p>
<p>He was at any rate the most real&mdash;she could touch him,
pay for him, suffer for him, worship him.&nbsp; He made her think
of her princes and dukes, and when she wished to fix these
figures in her mind&rsquo;s eye she thought of her boy.&nbsp; She
had often told me she was carried away by her own creations, and
she was certainly carried away by Leolin.&nbsp; He vivified, by
potentialities at least, the whole question of youth and
passion.&nbsp; She held, not unjustly, that the sincere novelist
should feel the whole flood of life; she acknowledged with regret
that she had not had time to feel it herself, and it was a joy to
her that the deficiency might be supplied by the sight of the way
it was rushing through this magnificent young man.&nbsp; She
exhorted him, I suppose, to let it rush; she wrung her own
flaccid little sponge into the torrent.&nbsp; I knew not what
passed between them in her hours of tuition, but I gathered that
she mainly impressed on him that the great thing was to live,
because that gave you material.&nbsp; He asked nothing better; he
collected material, and the formula served as a universal
pretext.&nbsp; You had only to look at him to see that, with his
rings and breastpins, his cross-barred jackets, his early
<i>embonpoint</i>, his eyes that looked like imitation jewels,
his various indications of a dense, full-blown temperament, his
idea of life was singularly vulgar; but he was not so far wrong
as that his response to his mother&rsquo;s expectations was not
in a high degree practical.&nbsp; If she had imposed a profession
on him from his tenderest years it was exactly a profession that
he followed.&nbsp; The two were not quite the same, inasmuch as
<i>his</i> was simply to live at her expense; but at least she
couldn&rsquo;t say that he hadn&rsquo;t taken a line.&nbsp; If
she insisted on believing in him he offered himself to the
sacrifice.&nbsp; My impression is that her secret dream was that
he should have a <i>liaison</i> with a countess, and he persuaded
her without difficulty that he had one.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know
what countesses are capable of, but I have a clear notion of what
Leolin was.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t persuade his sister, who despised
him&mdash;she wished to work her mother in her own way, and I
asked myself why the girl&rsquo;s judgment of him didn&rsquo;t
make me like her better.&nbsp; It was because it didn&rsquo;t
save her after all from a mute agreement with him to go
halves.&nbsp; There were moments when I couldn&rsquo;t help
looking hard into his atrocious young eyes, challenging him to
confess his fantastic fraud and give it up.&nbsp; Not a little
tacit conversation passed between us in this way, but he had
always the best of it.&nbsp; If I said: &ldquo;Oh, come now, with
<i>me</i> you needn&rsquo;t keep it up; plead guilty, and
I&rsquo;ll let you off,&rdquo; he wore the most ingenuous, the
most candid expression, in the depths of which I could read:
&ldquo;Oh, yes, I know it exasperates you&mdash;that&rsquo;s just
why I do it.&rdquo;&nbsp; He took the line of earnest inquiry,
talked about Balzac and Flaubert, asked me if I thought Dickens
<i>did</i> exaggerate and Thackeray <i>ought</i> to be called a
pessimist.&nbsp; Once he came to see me, at his mother&rsquo;s
suggestion he declared, on purpose to ask me how far, in my
opinion, in the English novel, one really might venture to
&ldquo;go.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was not resigned to the usual
pruderies&mdash;he suffered under them already.&nbsp; He struck
out the brilliant idea that nobody knew how far we might go, for
nobody had ever tried.&nbsp; Did I think <i>he</i> might safely
try&mdash;would it injure his mother if he did?&nbsp; He would
rather disgrace himself by his timidities than injure his mother,
but certainly some one ought to try.&nbsp; Wouldn&rsquo;t
<i>I</i> try&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t I be prevailed upon to look at
it as a duty?&nbsp; Surely the ultimate point ought to be
fixed&mdash;he was worried, haunted by the question.&nbsp; He
patronised me unblushingly, made me feel like a foolish amateur,
a helpless novice, inquired into my habits of work and conveyed
to me that I was utterly <i>vieux jeu</i> and had not had the
advantage of an early training.&nbsp; I had not been brought up
from the germ, I knew nothing of life&mdash;didn&rsquo;t go at it
on <i>his</i> system.&nbsp; He had dipped into French feuilletons
and picked up plenty of phrases, and he made a much better show
in talk than his poor mother, who never had time to read anything
and could only be vivid with her pen.&nbsp; If I didn&rsquo;t
kick him downstairs it was because he would have alighted on her
at the bottom.</p>
<p>When she went to live at Primrose Hill I called upon her and
found her weary and wasted.&nbsp; It had waned a good deal, the
elation caused the year before by Ethel&rsquo;s marriage; the
foam on the cup had subsided and there was a bitterness in the
draught.</p>
<p>She had had to take a cheaper house and she had to work still
harder to pay even for that.&nbsp; Sir Baldwin was obliged to be
close; his charges were fearful, and the dream of her living with
her daughter (a vision she had never mentioned to me) must be
renounced.&nbsp; &ldquo;I would have helped with things, and I
could have lived perfectly in one room,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I
would have paid for everything, and&mdash;after
all&mdash;I&rsquo;m some one, ain&rsquo;t I?&nbsp; But I
don&rsquo;t fit in, and Ethel tells me there are tiresome people
she <i>must</i> receive.&nbsp; I can help them from here, no
doubt, better than from there.&nbsp; She told me once, you know,
what she thinks of my picture of life.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mamma, your
picture of life is preposterous!&rsquo;&nbsp; No doubt it is, but
she&rsquo;s vexed with me for letting my prices go down; and I
had to write three novels to pay for all her marriage cost
me.&nbsp; I did it very well&mdash;I mean the outfit and the
wedding; but that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m here.&nbsp; At any rate
she doesn&rsquo;t want a dingy old woman in her house.&nbsp; I
should give it an atmosphere of literary glory, but literary
glory is only the eminence of nobodies.&nbsp; Besides, she doubts
my glory&mdash;she knows I&rsquo;m glorious only at Peckham and
Hackney.&nbsp; She doesn&rsquo;t want her friends to ask if
I&rsquo;ve never known nice people.&nbsp; She can&rsquo;t tell
them I&rsquo;ve never been in society.&nbsp; She tried to teach
me better once, but I couldn&rsquo;t learn.&nbsp; It would seem
too as if Peckham and Hackney had had enough of me; for
(don&rsquo;t tell any one!) I&rsquo;ve had to take less for my
last than I ever took for anything.&rdquo;&nbsp; I asked her how
little this had been, not from curiosity, but in order to upbraid
her, more disinterestedly than Lady Luard had done, for such
concessions.&nbsp; She answered &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ashamed to tell
you,&rdquo; and then she began to cry.</p>
<p>I had never seen her break down, and I was proportionately
moved; she sobbed, like a frightened child, over the extinction
of her vogue and the exhaustion of her vein.&nbsp; Her little
workroom seemed indeed a barren place to grow flowers, and I
wondered, in the after years (for she continued to produce and
publish) by what desperate and heroic process she dragged them
out of the soil.&nbsp; I remember asking her on that occasion
what had become of Leolin, and how much longer she intended to
allow him to amuse himself at her cost.&nbsp; She rejoined with
spirit, wiping her eyes, that he was down at Brighton hard at
work&mdash;he was in the midst of a novel&mdash;and that he
<i>felt</i> life so, in all its misery and mystery, that it was
cruel to speak of such experiences as a pleasure.&nbsp; &ldquo;He
goes beneath the surface,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and he
<i>forces</i> himself to look at things from which he would
rather turn away.&nbsp; Do you call that amusing yourself?&nbsp;
You should see his face sometimes!&nbsp; And he does it for me as
much as for himself.&nbsp; He tells me everything&mdash;he comes
home to me with his <i>trouvailles</i>.&nbsp; We are artists
together, and to the artist all things are pure.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
often heard you say so yourself.&rdquo;&nbsp; The novel that
Leolin was engaged in at Brighton was never published, but a
friend of mine and of Mrs. Stormer&rsquo;s who was staying there
happened to mention to me later that he had seen the young
apprentice to fiction driving, in a dogcart, a young lady with a
very pink face.&nbsp; When I suggested that she was perhaps a
woman of title with whom he was conscientiously flirting my
informant replied: &ldquo;She is indeed, but do you know what her
title is?&rdquo;&nbsp; He pronounced it&mdash;it was familiar and
descriptive&mdash;but I won&rsquo;t reproduce it here.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t know whether Leolin mentioned it to his mother: she
would have needed all the purity of the artist to forgive
him.&nbsp; I hated so to come across him that in the very last
years I went rarely to see her, though I knew that she had come
pretty well to the end of her rope.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t want her
to tell me that she had fairly to give her books away&mdash;I
didn&rsquo;t want to see her cry.&nbsp; She kept it up amazingly,
and every few months, at my club, I saw three new volumes, in
green, in crimson, in blue, on the book-table that groaned with
light literature.&nbsp; Once I met her at the Academy
soir&eacute;e, where you meet people you thought were dead, and
she vouchsafed the information, as if she owed it to me in
candour, that Leolin had been obliged to recognise insuperable
difficulties in the question of <i>form</i>, he was so
fastidious; so that she had now arrived at a definite
understanding with him (it was such a comfort) that <i>she</i>
would do the form if he would bring home the substance.&nbsp;
That was now his position&mdash;he foraged for her in the great
world at a salary.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s my
&lsquo;devil,&rsquo; don&rsquo;t you see? as if I were a great
lawyer: he gets up the case and I argue it.&rdquo;&nbsp; She
mentioned further that in addition to his salary he was paid by
the piece: he got so much for a striking character, so much for a
pretty name, so much for a plot, so much for an incident, and had
so much promised him if he would invent a new crime.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He <i>has</i> invented one,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and
he&rsquo;s paid every day of his life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she asked, looking hard at the
picture of the year; &ldquo;Baby&rsquo;s Tub,&rdquo; near which
we happened to be standing.</p>
<p>I hesitated a moment.&nbsp; &ldquo;I myself will write a
little story about it, and then you&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But she never saw; she had never seen anything, and she passed
away with her fine blindness unimpaired.&nbsp; Her son published
every scrap of scribbled paper that could be extracted from her
table-drawers, and his sister quarrelled with him mortally about
the proceeds, which showed that she only wanted a pretext, for
they cannot have been great.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know what Leolin
lives upon, unless it be on a queer lady many years older than
himself, whom he lately married.&nbsp; The last time I met him he
said to me with his infuriating smile: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you
think we can go a little further still&mdash;just a
little?&rdquo;&nbsp; <i>He</i> really goes too far.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
