 />THE br
 />LION&#8217;s MASQUERADE.



As Aurora stept forth from the gates of the East,
With her garland of roses, and dew-spangled vest,
A clamour unusual assaulted her ear,
Instead of the Lark, and her friend Chanticleer,
At least though their voices she sometimes could trace,
They seem&#8217;d overpower&#8217;d by the whole feather&#8217;d race:
And such was the chirping, and fluttering then,
It rouz&#8217;d an old Lion asleep in his den;
[p span
 class="pgmark">4] br
 />Enrag&#8217;d at this racket so much out of season,
He, roaring, sent out to ask what was the reason,
And the Jackal soon learnt from some stragglers about,
&#8217;Twas the company come from Sir Argus&#8217;s rout.
The gay feather&#8217;d people pursuing their flight,
Were soon out of hearing, and soon out of sight.
But the King of the Quadrupeds vainly sought rest,
For something like envy had poison&#8217;d his breast.
What then were his feelings the following day,
When every creature he met on his way,
Could talk about nothing, both early and late,
But the Peacock&#8217;s most sumptuous, and elegant fête.
His name, through the woods as he wander&#8217;d along,
Was still made the burthen of every song.
[p span
 class="pgmark">5] br
 />That the concert was exquisite, all were agreed,
And so were the ball, and the supper indeed,
The company too of the very first rank,
And the wit that prevail&#8217;d, and the toasts that were drank:
He found to his infinite rage and vexation,
&#8217;Twas the favourite subject half over the nation;
And feeling no longer a relish to roam,
He return&#8217;d to his Lioness, sullenly, home.
&ldquo;Fair consort of mine, &#8217;tis our pleasure,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;To give very shortly, a grand Masquerade.
Tho&#8217; the Butterfly&#8217;s ball, and the Grasshopper&#8217;s feasts,
Were too mean for my notice, as King of the beasts;
Now the Peacock has chosen to give a fine rout,
Which is heard of so much, is so blazon&#8217;d about,
[p span
 class="pgmark">6] br
 />Has excited such rapture, and warm approbation,
As threatens the rank which we hold in creation.
Then with diligence, love, for my banquet prepare,
And mind all the beasts of the forest are there.&rdquo;
&#8217;Twas the task of the Jackal the tickets to pen,
&ldquo;The Lion sees masks, on the twentieth, at ten.&rdquo;
It would take a whole volume distinctly to name,
The answer on answer that following came.
There were some that were sick from the changeable weather,
And some long engag&#8217;d in snug parties together.
But few, very few would refuse such a thing,
As a grand entertainment announc&#8217;d by their King.
All devoted the time now to due preparation,
To decide on their character, dress, decoration.

[p span
 class="pgmark">7] br
 />At length Ph&oelig;bus dawn&#8217;d on the long wish&#8217;d-for day
Which their beauty, their talents, and wit should display.
What licking, and cleaning, what endless adorning,
Not a creature stirr&#8217;d out the whole course of the morning;
And some of their dresses were barely complete,
At the time they were punctually order&#8217;d to meet,
The Lioness, willing to sanction the rest,
With a helmet, and spear, as Britannia was drest;
But the Lion, as lord of the banquet, remain&#8217;d
In the same noble figure that Nature ordain&#8217;d;
And crouching beside her, with dignified mien,
Contributed much to the state of his Queen.
The Jackal Lord Chamberlain waited upon her,
And two little Lap-dogs as Pages of Honour:
[p span
 class="pgmark">8] br
 />While twelve Orang-Outangs were station&#8217;d without,
To usher the company in, and about.
At the hour which his King had thought proper to name,
The Horse, as the Hounyhm of Gulliver came;
Unaccustomed to &ldquo;utter the thing that is not,&rdquo; a name="fna.1"
 id="fna.1" href="#fn.1">*
He reach&#8217;d, at the moment he promis&#8217;d, the spot.
The Fox then appear&#8217;d on a different scent,
On foul depredation, and villainy bent;
And the dress of a country attorney he chose,
To his purpose best suited, as all the world knows!
With looks as impatient, and teeming with sin,
The Wolf in Sheep&#8217;s-clothing was next usher&#8217;d in.

[p span
 class="pgmark">9] br
 />The guests now came thronging in numbers untold,
The furious, the gentle, the young and the old.
In dominos some, but in characters most,
And now a brave warrior, and then a fair toast.
The Baboon, as a Counsellor; Alderman, Glutton;
A Lamb, Miss in her teens, with her aunt, an old mutton.
It was easy to see, as this couple past by,
The Wolf, very knowingly, cast a Sheep&#8217;s eye.
And now at the door was a terrible clatter,
The beasts all about wonder&#8217;d what was the matter.
A poor Cat in pattens came running so fast,
Her ticket was almost forgot as the past;
[p span
 class="pgmark">10] br
 />But there was, it appear&#8217;d, quite enough to alarm her,
For close at her heels came a great Hog in armour.
Then follow&#8217;d his friend in a very large wig
As a deep read professor&mdash;the fam&#8217;d learned Pig&mdash;
A Bear came as Caliban, loaded with wood,
His bones full of aches from Prospero&#8217;s rod.
The Greyhound as Vanity holding a glass,
The Stag, as Actæon; King Midas, the Ass.
And next them a sullen, and obstinate Mule,
As a Dunce, who had just been expell&#8217;d from his school.
The Mastiff a brave English sailor appear&#8217;d,
No friend he betray&#8217;d, and no enemy fear&#8217;d:

[p span

 />Britannia receiv&#8217;d him with mark&#8217;d condescension,
And paid him all night, most distinguished attention.
Now skipping along on the tip of his toe,
Came a chattering Monkey, a Frenchifi&#8217;d beau:
And reeling behind, in an officer&#8217;s dress,
Was his pert younger brother, just come from the mess;
With manners as forward, and strut as complete,
As other young Ensigns you see in the street.
The Bull came as Taurus, all studded with stars;
Capricornus, the Goat; a Bull-dog, as Mars.
Now refreshments by order were handed about,
And the dancing commenc&#8217;d with a terrible rout;
[p span
 class="pgmark">12] br
 />When suddenly silence pervaded the throng,
Some Eastern grandees were conducted along.
Attendants preceded with all due decorum,
And Spaniels, as courtiers, came fawning before &#8217;em.
No longer in servitude bending the knee,
And destin&#8217;d, the first of his kind, to be free,
The Camel approach&#8217;d, with magnificence drest
As a Nabob, who lately arriv&#8217;d from the East.
From the Island of Ceylon an Elephant came,
In costume complete, as the King of Siam:
Thence follow&#8217;d a Native of snowy white race,
Respect and affection, were mark&#8217;d in his face,

[p span
 class="pgmark">13] br
 />An appendage of grandeur, with chowries hung round,
And tissu&#8217;d embroidery that trail&#8217;d on the ground;
Round his tusks precious stones, gold, and diamonds were set,
He was one splendid mass from his head to his feet.
The Tiger, a fierce Indian Chief, in the rear,
Many foreigners too of distinction were there.
This magnificent group so astonish&#8217;d the crowd,
That some, in their rapture, applauded aloud.
Supper now was announc&#8217;d; with a terrible crush,
To the door did the ravenous visitants rush:
For some time none could pass, but the first that were able,
Found, Glutton the Alderman, seated at table.
[p span
 class="pgmark">14] br
 />At the banquet the guests in amazement were lost,
And the King of Siam took the right of his host.
Beside him, a vase fill&#8217;d with water was plac&#8217;d,
Of chrystal, and gold, very skilfully chac&#8217;d:
With flow&#8217;rs of the orange the handles were bound,
And Otto of Roses was sprinkled around&mdash;
Before him were cocoa nuts, figs, wheat, and rice,
The wood of acacia, banana, and spice:
With arrack, and every delicate wine,
That each nation can press from the clustering vine.
To proceed were but tedious; for every beast,
As well as the Elephant, found a rich feast.

 />And now their great Monarch, who quitted his seat,
With an air of true majesty said, &ldquo;I entreat,
As he fears my displeasure, that every creature,
Will to-night lay aside all that&#8217;s bad in his nature.
You have heard with what harmony Birds can retire,
And their conduct in this respect all must admire.
In the feather&#8217;d race here an example we find,
Far better than that which is set by Mankind.
How oft have their  !-- Trancriber's note:
 original reads 'gala&#8217;s' -->galas a tragical end,
One loses a mistress, another a friend&mdash;
The wife of a third has elop&#8217;d from a ball,
A fourth the next day in a duel must fall.
[p span
 class="pgmark">16] br
 />Yes! such are the fatal effects of excess,
Which reason was given to man to repress.
But now let us tell them, with pride, in their feasts,
To copy the Insects, the Birds, and the Beasts.&rdquo;
The effect of his speech was immediately seen,
They all roar&#8217;d &ldquo;Rule Britannia&rdquo; in praise of his Queen.
And as soon as their Monarch had quitted the room,
Without growl, grunt, or grumble, they all scrambled home.


FINIS.

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
