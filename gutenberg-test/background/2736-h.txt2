      CHAPTER I.
    
    
      A DUCAL MONOMANIAC.
    
    
      The traveller who wishes to go from Poitiers to London by the shortest
      route will find that the simplest way is to take a seat in the stage-coach
      which runs to Saumur; and when you book your place, the polite clerk tells
      you that you must take your seat punctually at six o'clock. The next
      morning, therefore, the traveller has to rise from his bed at a very early
      hour, and make a hurried and incomplete toilet, and on arriving, flushed
      and panting, at the office, discover that there was no occasion for such
      extreme haste.
    
    
      In the hotel from whence the coach starts every one seems to be asleep,
      and a waiter, whose eyes are scarcely open, wanders languidly about. There
      is not the slightest good in losing your temper, or in pouring out a
      string of violent remonstrances. In a small restaurant opposite a cup of
      hot coffee can be procured, and it is there that the disappointed
      travellers congregate, to await the hour when the coach really makes a
      start.
    
    
      At length, however, all is ready, the conductor utters a tremendous
      execration, the coachman cracks his whip, the horses spring forward, the
      wheels rattle, and the coach is off at last. Whilst the conductor smokes
      his pipe tranquilly, the passengers gaze out of the windows and admire the
      beautiful aspect of the surrounding country. On each side stretch the
      woods and fields of Bevron. The covers are full of game, which has
      increased enormously, as the owner of the property has never allowed a
      shot to be fired since he had the misfortune, some twenty years ago, to
      kill one of his dependents whilst out shooting. On the right hand side
      some distance off rise the tower and battlements of the Chateau de
      Mussidan. It is two years ago since the Dowager Countess of Chevanche
      died, leaving all her fortune to her niece, Mademoiselle Sabine de
      Mussidan. She was a kind-hearted woman, rough and ready in her manner, but
      very popular amongst the peasantry. Farther off, on the top of some rising
      ground, appears an imposing structure, of an ancient style of
      architecture; this is the ancient residence of the Dukes of Champdoce. The
      left wing is a picturesque mass of ruins; the roof has fallen in, and the
      mullions of the windows are dotted with a thick growth of clustering ivy.
      Rain, storm, and sunshine have all done their work, and painted the
      mouldering walls with a hundred varied tints. In 1840 the inheritor of one
      of the noblest names of France resided here with his only son. The name of
      the present proprietor was Caesar Guillaume Duepair de Champdoce. He was
      looked upon both by the gentry and peasantry of the country side as a most
      eccentric individual. He could be seen any day wandering about, dressed in
      the most shabby manner, and wearing a coat that was frequently in urgent
      need of repair, a leathern cap on his head, wooden shoes, and a stout
      oaken cudgel in his hand. In winter he supplemented to these an ancient
      sheepskin coat. He was sixty years of age, very powerfully built, and
      possessing enormous strength. The expression upon his face showed that his
      will was as strong as his thews and sinews. Beneath his shaggy eyebrows
      twinkled a pair of light-gray eyes, which darkened when a fit of passion
      overtook him, and this was no unusual occurrence.
    
    
      During his military career in the army of the Conde, he had received a
      sabre cut across his cheek, and the cicatrice imparted a strange and
      unpleasant expression to his face. He was not a bad-hearted man, but
      headstrong, violent, and tyrannical to a degree. The peasants saluted him
      with a mixture of respect and dread as he walked to the chapel, to which
      he was a regular attendant on Sundays, with his son. During the Mass he
      made the responses in an audible voice, and at its conclusion invariably
      put a five-franc piece into the plate. This, his subscription to the
      newspaper, and the sum he paid for being shaved twice each week,
      constituted the whole of his outlay upon himself. He kept an excellent
      table, however; plump fowls, vegetables of all kinds, and the most
      delicious fruit were never absent from it. Everything, however, that
      appeared upon his well-plenished board was the produce of his fields,
      gardens, or woods. The nobility and gentry of the neighborhood frequently
      invited him to their hospitable tables, for they looked upon him as the
      head and chief of the nobility of the county; but he always refused their
      invitations, saying plainly, "No man who has the slightest respect for
      himself will accept hospitalities which he is not in a position to
      return." It was not the grinding clutch of poverty that drove the Duke to
      this exercise of severe economy, for his income from his estates brought
      him in fifty thousand francs per annum; and it was reported that his
      investments brought him in as much more. As a matter of course, therefore,
      he was looked upon as a miser, and a victim to the sordid vice of avarice.
    
    
      His past life might, in some degree, offer an explanation of this conduct.
      Born in 1780, the Duke de Champdoce had joined the band of emigrants which
      swelled the ranks of Conde's army. An implacable opposer of the
      Revolution, he resided, during the glorious days of the Empire, in London,
      where dire poverty compelled him to gain a livelihood as a fencing master
      at the Restoration. He came back with the Bourbons to his native land,
      and, by an almost miraculous chance, was put again in possession of his
      ancestral domains. But in his opinion he was living in a state of utter
      destitution as compared to the enormous revenues enjoyed by the
      dead-and-gone members of the Champdoce family; and what pained him more
      was to see rise up by the side of the old aristocracy a new race which had
      attached itself to commerce and entered into business transactions. As he
      gazed upon the new order of things, the man whose pride of birth and
      position almost amounted to insanity, conceived the project to which he
      determined to devote the remainder of his life. He imagined that he had
      discovered a means by which he could restore the ancient house of
      Champdoce to all its former splendor and position. "I can," said he, "by
      living like a peasant and resorting to no unnecessary expense, treble my
      capital in twenty years; and if my son and my grandson will only follow my
      example, the race of Champdoce will again recover the proud position that
      it formerly held." Faithful to this idea, he wedded, in 1820, although his
      heart was entirely untouched, a young girl of noble birth but utterly
      devoid of beauty, though possessed of a magnificent dowry. Their union was
      an extremely unhappy one, and many persons did not hesitate to accuse the
      Duke of treating with harshness and severity a young girl, who, having
      brought her husband five hundred thousand francs, could not understand why
      she should be refused a new dress when she urgently needed it. After
      twelve months of inconceivable unhappiness, she gave birth to a son who
      was baptized Louis Norbert, and six months afterwards she sank into an
      untimely grave.
    
    
      The Duke did not seem to regret his loss very deeply. The boy appeared to
      be of a strong and robust constitution, and his mother's dowry would go to
      swell the revenues of the Champdoce family. He made his recent loss, too,
      the pretext for further retrenchments and economies.
    
    
      Norbert was brought up exactly as a farmer's son would have been. Every
      morning he started off to work, carrying his day's provisions in a basket
      slung upon his back. As he grew older, he was taught to sow and reap, to
      estimate the value of a standing crop at a glance, and, last but not
      least, to drive a hard bargain. For a long time the Duke debated the
      expediency of permitting his son to be taught to read or write; and if he
      did so at last, it was owing to some severe remarks by the parish priest
      upon the day on which Norbert took the sacrament for the first time.
    
    
      All went on well and smoothly until the day when Norbert, on his sixteenth
      birthday, accompanied his father to Poitiers for the first time.
    
    
      At sixteen years of age, Louis Norbert de Champdoce looked fully twenty,
      and was as handsome a youth as could be seen for miles round. The sun had
      given a bronzed tint to his features which was exceedingly becoming. He
      had black hair, with a slight curl running through it, and large
      melancholy blue eyes, which he inherited from his mother. Poor girl! it
      was the sole beauty that she had possessed. He was utterly uncultured, and
      had been ruled with such a rod of iron by his father that he had never
      been a league from the Chateau. His ideas were barred by the little town
      of Bevron, with its sixty houses, its town hall, its small chapel, and
      principal river; and to him it seemed a spot full of noise and confusion.
      In the whole course of his life he had never spoken to three persons who
      did not belong to the district. Bred up in this secluded manner, it was
      almost impossible for him to understand that any one could lead a
      different existence to that of his own. His only pleasure was in procuring
      an abundant harvest, and his sole idea of excitement was High Mass on
      Sunday.
    
    
      For more than a year the village girls had cast sly glances at him, but he
      was far too simple and innocent to notice this. When Mass was over, he
      generally walked over the farm with his father to inspect the work of the
      past week, or to set snares for the birds. His father at last determined
      to give him a wider experience, and one day said that he was to accompany
      him to Poitiers.
    
    
      At a very early hour in the morning they started in one of the low country
      carts of the district, and under the seat were small sacks, containing
      over forty thousand francs in silver money. Norbert had long wished to
      visit Poitiers, but had never done so, though it was but fifteen miles
      off. Poitiers is a quaint old town, with dilapidated pavements and tall,
      gloomy houses, the architecture of which dates from the tenth century; but
      Norbert thought that it must be one of the most magnificent cities in the
      world. It was market day when they drove in, and he was absolutely
      stupefied with surprise and excitement. He had never believed there could
      be so many people in one place, and hardly noticed that the cart had
      pulled up opposite a lawyer's office. His father shook him roughly by the
      shoulder.
    
    
      "Come, Norbert, lad, we are there," said he.
    
    
      The young man jumped to the ground, and assisted mechanically to remove
      the sacks. The servile manner of the lawyer did not strike him, nor did he
      listen to the conversation between him and his father. Finally, the
      business being concluded, they took their departure, and, driving to the
      Market Place, put up the horse and cart at an old-fashioned, dingy inn,
      where they took their breakfast in the public room at a table where the
      wagoners were having a violent quarrel over their meal. The Duke, however,
      had other business to transact than the investment of his money, for he
      wanted to find the whereabouts of a miller who was somewhat in his debt.
      Norbert waited for him in front of the inn, and could not help feeling
      rather uncomfortable at finding himself alone. All at once some one came
      up and touched him lightly on the shoulder. He turned round sharply, and
      found himself face to face with a young man, who, seeing his look of
      surprise, said,       
    
    
      "What! have you entirely forgotten your old friend Montlouis?"
    
    
      Montlouis was the son of one of the Duke's farmers, and he and Norbert had
      often played together in past years. They had driven their cows to the
      meadows together, and had spent long days together fishing or searching
      for birds' nests. The dress now worn by Montlouis had at first prevented
      Norbert from recognizing him, for he was attired in the uniform of the
      college at which his father had placed him, being desirous of making
      something more than a mere farmer of his son.
    
    
      "What are you doing here?" asked Norbert.
    
    
      "I am waiting for my father."
    
    
      "So am I. Let us have a cup of coffee together."
    
    
      Montlouis led his playmate into a small wine shop near at hand. He seemed
      a little disposed to presume upon the superior knowledge of the world
      which he had recently acquired.
    
    
      "If there was a billiard-table here," said he, "we could pass away the
      time with a game, though, to be sure, it runs into money."
    
    
      Norbert never had had more than a few pence in his pocket at one time, and
      at this remark the color rose to his face, and he felt much humiliated.
    
    
      "My father," added the young collegian, "gives me all I ask for. I am
      certain of getting one, if not two prizes at the next examination; and
      when I have taken my degree, the Count de Mussidan has promised to make me
      his steward. What do you think that you will do?"
    
    
      "I       I don't know," stammered Norbert.
    
    
      "You will, I suppose, dig and toil in the fields, as your father has done
      before you. You are the son of the noblest and the richest man for miles
      round, and yet you are not so happy as I am."
    
    
      Upon the return of the Duke de Champdoce some little time after this
      conversation, he did not detect any change in his son's manner; but the
      words spoken by Montlouis had fallen into Norbert's brain like a subtle
      poison, and a few careless sentences uttered by an inconsiderate lad had
      annihilated the education of sixteen years, and a complete change had
      taken place in Norbert's mind, a change which was utterly unsuspected by
      those around him, for his manner of bringing up had taught him to keep his
      own counsel.
    
    
      The fixed smile on his features entirely masked the angry feelings that
      were working in his breast. He went through his daily tasks, which had
      once been a pleasure to him, with utter disgust and loathing. His eyes had
      been suddenly opened, and he now understood a host of things which he had
      never before even endeavored to comprehend. He saw now that his proper
      position was among the nobles, whom he never saw except when they attended
      Mass at the little chapel in Bevron. The Count de Mussidan, so haughty and
      imposing, with his snow-white hair; the aristocratic-looking Marquis de
      Laurebourg, of whom the peasants stood in the greatest awe, were always
      courteous and even cordial in their salutations, while the noble dames
      smiled graciously upon him. Proud and haughty as they were, they evidently
      looked upon his father and himself as their equals, in spite of the coarse
      garments that they wore. The realization of these facts effected a great
      change in Norbert. He was the equal of all these people, and yet how great
      a gulf separated him from them. While he and his father tramped to Mass in
      heavy shoes, the others drove up in their carriages with powdered footmen
      to open the doors. Why was this extraordinary difference? He knew enough
      of the value of crops and land to know that his father was as wealthy as
      any of these gentlemen. The laborers on the farm said that his father was
      a miser, and the villagers asserted that he got up at night and gazed with
      rapture upon the treasure that was hidden away from men's eyes.
    
    
      "Norbert is an unhappy lad," they would say. "He who ought to be able to
      command all the pleasures of life is worse off than our own children."
    
    
      He also recollected that one day, as his father was talking to the Marquis
      de Laurebourg, an old lady, who was doubtless the Marchioness, had said,
      "Poor boy! he was so early deprived of a mother's care!" What did that
      mean unless it was a reflection upon the arbitrary behavior of his father?
      Norbert saw that these people always had their children with them, and the
      sight of this filled him with jealousy, and brought tears of anguish to
      his eyes. Sometimes, as he trudged wearily behind his yoke of oxen, goad
      in hand, he would see some of these young scions of the aristocracy canter
      by on horseback, and the friendly wave of the hand with which they greeted
      him almost appeared to his jaundiced mind a premeditated insult. What
      could they find to do in Paris, to which they all took wing at the first
      breath of winter? This was a question which he found himself utterly
      unable to solve. To drink to intoxication offered no charms to him, and
      yet this was the only pleasure which the villagers seemed to enjoy. Those
      young men must have some higher class of entertainment, but in what could
      it consist? Norbert could hardly read a line without spelling every word;
      but these new thoughts running through his mind caused him to study, so as
      to improve his education. His father had often told him that he did not
      like lads who where always poring over books; and so Norbert did not
      discontinue his studies, but simply avoided bringing them under his
      father's notice. He knew that there was a large collection of books in one
      of the upstairs rooms of the Chateau. He managed to force the lock of the
      door, and he found some thousands of volumes, of which at least two
      hundred were novels, which had been the solace of his mother's unhappy
      life. With all the eagerness of a man who is at the point of starvation
      and finds an unexpected store of provisions, Norbert seized upon them. At
      first he had great difficulty in dividing fact from fiction.
    
    
      He arrived at two conclusions from perusing this heterogeneous mass of
      literature       one was, that he was most unhappy; and the other was,
      that he hated his father with a cold and determined loathing. Had he
      dared, he would have shown this feeling openly, but the Duke de Champdoce
      inspired him with an unconquerable feeling of terror. This state of
      affairs continued for some months, and at the end of that time the Duke
      felt that he ought to make his son acquainted with his projects. One
      Sunday, after supper, he commenced this task. Norbert had never seen his
      father so animated as he was at this moment, when all his ancestral pride
      blazed in his eyes. He explained at length the acts and deeds of those
      heroes who had been the ornament of their house, and enumerated the
      influential marriages which had been made by them in the days when their
      very name was a power in the land. And what remained of all their power
      and rank, save their Parisian domicile, their old Chateau, and some two
      hundred thousand francs of income?
    
    
      Norbert could hardly credit what he heard; he had never believed that his
      father possessed such enormous wealth. "Why, it is inconceivable!" he
      muttered. And yet, as he looked round, he saw that the surroundings were
      those of a peasant's cottage. How could he endure so many discomforts and
      wounds to his pride? In his anger he absolutely started to his feet with
      the intention of reproaching his father, but his courage failed him, and
      he fell back into a chair, quivering with emotion.
    
    
      The Duke de Champdoce was pacing up and down the room.
    
    
      "Do you think it so little?" asked he angrily.
    
    
      Norbert knew that not one of the neighboring nobility who had the
      reputation of being wealthy possessed half this annual income, and it was
      with a feeling of bitter anger in his heart that he listened to the broken
      words which fell from his father's lips. All at once the Duke halted in
      front of his son's chair.
    
    
      "What fortune I have now," said he in a hoarse voice, "is little or
      nothing in times like these, when the tradesman contrives to make an
      almost unlimited income, and, setting up as a gentleman, imitates, not our
      virtues, but our vices; while the nobles, not understanding the present
      hour, are in poverty and want. Without money, nothing can be done. To hold
      his own against these mushroom fortunes, a Champdoce should possess
      millions. Neither you nor I, my son, will see our coffers overflowing with
      millions, but our descendants will reap the benefit of our toil. Our
      ancestors gained their name and glory by their determination; let us show
      that we are their worthy offspring."
    
    
      As he approached the subject which had occupied his mind entirely for
      years, the old noble's voice quivered and shook.
    
    
      "I have done my duty," said he, calming himself by a mighty effort, "and
      it is now your turn to do yours. You shall marry some wealthy heiress, and
      you shall bring up your son as I have reared and nurtured you. You will be
      able to leave him fifteen millions; and if he will only follow in our
      footsteps, he will be able to bequeath to his heir a fortune that a
      monarch might envy. And this shall and will come to pass, because it is my
      fixed determination."
    
    
      The strange outburst of confidence petrified Norbert.
    
    
      "The task is heavy and painful," continued the Duke, "but it is one that
      several scores of illustrious houses have accomplished. He who wishes to
      revive the fallen fortunes of some mighty house must live only in the
      future, and have no thought but for the prosperity of his descendants.
      More than once I have faltered and hesitated, but I have conquered my
      weakness, and now only live to make the line of Champdoce the most wealthy
      in France. You have seen me haggle for an hour over a wretched louis, but
      it was for the reason that at a future day one of our descendants might
      fling it to a beggar from the window of his magnificent equipage. Next
      year I will take you to Paris and show you our house there. You will see
      in it the most wonderful tapestry, pictures by the best masters, for I
      have ornamented and embellished it as a lover adorns a house for a beloved
      mistress, and that house, Norbert, is the home that your grandchildren
      will dwell in."
    
    
      The Duke uttered these words in a tone of jubilant triumph.
    
    
      "I have spoken to you thus," resumed he, after a short pause, "because you
      are now of an age to listen to the truth, and because I wished you to
      understand the rules by which you are to regulate your life. You have now
      arrived at years of discretion, and must do of your own free will what you
      have up to this time done at my bidding. This is all that I have to say.
      To-morrow you will take twenty-five sacks of wheat to the miller at
      Bevron."
    
    
      Like all tyrannical despots, the Duke never contemplated for a moment the
      possibility of any one disobeying his commands; yet at this very moment
      Norbert was registering a solemn mental oath that he would never carry out
      his father's wishes. His anger, which his fears had so long restrained,
      now burst all bounds, and it was in the broad chestnut tree avenue, behind
      the Chateau, far from any listening ear, that he gave way to his despair.
      So long as he had only looked upon his father as a mere miser, he had
      permitted himself to indulge in hope; but now he understood him better,
      and saw that life-long plans, such as the Duke had framed, were not to be
      easily overruled.
    
    
      "My father is mad," said he; "yes; decidedly mad."
    
    
      He had made up his mind that for the present he would yield to his
      despotism, but afterwards, in the future, what was he to do?
    
    
      It is an easy thing to find persons to give you bad advice, and the very
      next day Norbert found one at Bevron in the shape of a certain man called
      Daumon, a bitter enemy of the Duke.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER II.
    
    
      A DANGEROUS ACQUAINTANCE.
    
    
      Daumon was not a native of this part of the country, and no one knew from
      whence he came. He said that he had been an attorney's clerk, and had
      certainly resided for a long time in Paris. He was a little man of fifty
      years of age, clean shaved, and with a sharp and cunning expression of
      countenance. His long nose, sharp, restless eyes, and thin lips, attracted
      attention at first sight. His whole aspect aroused a feeling of distrust.
      He had come to Bevron, some fifteen years before, with all his provisions
      in a cotton handkerchief slung over his shoulder. He was willing to make
      money in any way, and he prospered and rose. He owned fields, vineyards,
      and a cottage, which is at the juncture of the highway to Poitiers and the
      cross road that leads to Bevron. His aim and object were to be seen
      everywhere, to know everybody, and to have a finger in every pie in the
      neighborhood around. If any of the farmers or the laborers wanted small
      advances, they went to him, and he granted them loans at exorbitant rates
      of interest. He gave most disputants counsel, and had every point of law
      at his fingers' ends. He could teach people how to sail as close to the
      wind as possible, and yet to be beyond the reach of the law. He affected
      to be only too anxious to ameliorate the lot of the peasant class, and yet
      he was drawing heavy sums from them by way of interest. He endeavored by
      every means in his power to rouse their feelings of animosity against both
      the priesthood and the gentry. His artful way of talking, and the long
      black coat which he wore, had given him the nickname of the "Counsellor"
      in the district. The reason why he disliked the Duke was because the
      latter had more than once shown himself hostile to him, and had taken him
      before the court of justice, from which Daumon only escaped by means of
      bribery of suborned witnesses. He vowed that he would be revenged for
      this, and for five years had been watching his opportunity, and this was
      the man whom Norbert met when he went to deliver his corn to the miller.
      As he was coming back with his empty wagon, Daumon asked for a lift back
      as far as the cross road that led to his cottage.
    
    
      "I trust, sir," said he with the most servile courtesy, "that you will
      excuse the liberty I take, but I am so utterly crippled with rheumatism
      that I can hardly walk, Marquis."
    
    
      Daumon had read somewhere that the eldest son of a Duke was entitled to be
      styled Marquis, and it was the first time that Norbert had been
      thus addressed. Before this he would have laughed at the appellation, but
      now his wounded vanity, and his exasperation at the unhappy condition in
      which he found himself, tempted him to accept the title without
      remonstrance.
    
    
      "All right, I can give you a lift," said he, and the Counsellor clambered
      into the cart.
    
    
      All the time that he was showering thanks upon Norbert for his courtesy he
      was watching the young man's face carefully.
    
    
      "Evidently," thought the Counsellor to himself, "something unusual has
      taken place at the Chateau de Champdoce. Was not the opportunity for
      revenge here?"
    
    
      Long since he had decided that through the son he could strike the father.
      But he must be cautious.
    
    
      "You must have been up very early, Marquis," said he.
    
    
      The young man made no reply.
    
    
      "The Duke," resumed Daumon, "is most fortunate in having such a son as
      you. I know more than one father who says to his children, 'See what an
      excellent example the young Marquis de Champdoce sets to you all. He is
      not afraid of hard work, though he is noble by birth, and should not soil
      his hands by labor.'"
    
    
      A sudden lurch brought the Counsellor's eloquence to a sudden close, but
      he speedily resumed again.
    
    
      "I was watching you as you hefted the sacks. Heavens! what muscles! what a
      pair of shoulders!"
    
    
      At any other moment Norbert would have gloried in such laudation, but now
      he felt displeased and annoyed, and vented his anger by a sharp cut at his
      team.
    
    
      "When people say that you are as innocent as a girl," continued Daumon, "I
      always say that you are a sensible young fellow after all, and that if you
      choose to lead a regular life, it is far better than wasting your future
      fortune in wine, billiards, cards, or women."
    
    
      "I don't know that I might not do something of the kind," returned
      Norbert.
    
    
      "What did you say?" answered his wily companion.
    
    
      "I said that if I were my own master, I would live as other young men."
    
    
      The lad paused abruptly, and Daumon's eyes gleamed with joy.
    
    
      "Aha," murmured he to himself; "I have the game in my own hands. I will
      teach his Grace to interfere with me."
    
    
      Then, in a voice which could reach Norbert's ears, he continued,       
    
    
      "Of course some parents are far too strict."
    
    
      An impatient gesture from Norbert showed him that he had wounded him
      deeply.
    
    
      "Yes, yes," put in the wily Counsellor, "as the head grows bald, and the
      blood begins to stagnate, they forget,       they forget the days when all
      was so different. They forget the time when they were young, and when they
      sowed their wild oats with so lavish a hand. When your father was
      twenty-five, he was precious wild. Ask your father, if you do not believe
      me."
    
    
      At this moment the wagon passed the cross road, and Norbert pulled up.
    
    
      "I cannot thank you enough, Marquis," said the Counsellor as he alighted
      with difficulty; "but if you would condescend to come and taste my brandy,
      I would esteem it a great honor."
    
    
      Norbert hesitated for an instant: his reasoning powers urged him to
      decline the offer, but he refused to listen to them, and, fastening his
      horses to a tree, he followed Daumon down the by-road. The cottage was an
      excellent one, and extremely well furnished. A woman, who acted as
      Daumon's housekeeper, served the refreshments. The office       for he
      called his room an office, just as if he was a professional man       was
      a strange-looking place. On one side was a desk covered with account
      books, and against the wall were sacks of seed. A number of books on legal
      matters crowded the shelves, and from the ceiling hung a quantity of dried
      herbs. The Counsellor welcomed the heir to the dukedom of Champdoce with
      the greatest deference, seated him in his own capacious leathern
      arm-chair, and pressed the brandy which he had refused upon him.
    
    
      "I got this brandy from a man down Arcachon way in return for a kindness
      that I did him; for, without boasting, I may say that I have done
      kindnesses for many people in my time." He raised his glass to his lips as
      he spoke. "It is good, is it not?" said he. "You can't get stuff with an
      aroma like that hereabouts."
    
    
      The extreme deference of the man, coupled with the excellence of the
      spirit, opened Norbert's heart in a very short space of time. Up to the
      present the conduct of poor Norbert had been blameless, but now, without
      knowing anything of the Counsellor's character or reputation, he poured
      out all the secret sorrows of his heart, while Daumon chuckled secretly,
      preserving all the time the imperturbable face of a physician called in to
      visit a patient.
    
    
      "Dear me! dear me!" said he; "this is really too bad. Poor fellow! I
      really pity you. Were it not for the deep respect that I have for the
      Duke, your father, I should feel inclined to say that he was not quite in
      his right senses."
    
    
      "Yes," continued Norbert, the tears starting to his eyes, "this is just
      how I am situated. My destiny has been marked out for me, and I am
      helpless to alter it. I had better a thousand times be lying under the
      cold greensward, than vegetate thus above ground."
    
    
      The peculiar smile on Daumon's lips caused him to pause in his complaint.
    
    
      "Perhaps," he went on, "you think that I am childish in talking thus?"
    
    
      "Not at all, Marquis, you have suffered too deeply; but forgive me if I
      say that you are foolish to despond so much over the future that lies
      before you."
    
    
      "Future!" repeated Norbert angrily, "what is the use of speaking to me of
      the future, when I may be kept in this horrible servitude for the next
      thirty years? My father is still hale and hearty."
    
    
      "What of that? You will be of age soon, and then you will have full right
      to claim your mother's fortune."
    
    
      The extreme surprise displayed by Norbert at this intelligence convinced
      the Counsellor that he was much more unsophisticated than he had supposed
      him to be.
    
    
      "A man," continued he, "can, when he attains his majority, dispose of his
      inheritance as he thinks fit, and your mother's fortune will render you
      independent of your father."
    
    
      "But I should never dare to claim it; how could I venture to do so?"
    
    
      "You need not make the application personally; your solicitor would manage
      all that for you; but, of course, you must wait until you are of age."
    
    
      "But I cannot wait until then," said Norbert; "I must at once free myself
      from this tyranny."
    
    
      "Luckily there are ways."
    
    
      "Do you really think so, Daumon?"
    
    
      "Yes, and I will show you what is done every day. Nothing is more common
      in noble families. Would you like to be a soldier?"
    
    
      "No, I do not care for that, and yet              "
    
    
      "That is your last resource, Marquis. First, then, we could lay a plaint
      before the court."
    
    
      "A plaint?"
    
    
      "Certainly. Do you suppose that our laws do not provide for such a case as
      a father exceeding the proper bounds of parental authority? Tell me, has
      the Duke, your father, ever struck you?"
    
    
      "Never once."
    
    
      "Well, that is almost a pity. We will say that your father's property is
      worth two millions, and yet you derive so slight a benefit from this that
      you are known everywhere as the 'Young Savage of Champdoce'!"
    
    
      Norbert started to his feet.
    
    
      "Who dares speak of me like that?" said he furiously. "Tell me his name."
    
    
      This outburst of passion did not in the smallest degree discompose Daumon.
    
    
      "Your father has many enemies, Marquis," he resumed, "for his manners are
      overbearing and exacting; but you have many friends, and among them all
      you will find none more devoted than myself, humble though my position may
      be. Many ladies of high rank take a great interest in you. Only a day or
      two ago some persons were speaking of you in the presence of Mademoiselle
      de Laurebourg, and she blushed crimson at your name. Do you know
      Mademoiselle Diana?"
    
    
      Norbert colored.
    
    
      "Ah, I understand," replied Daumon. "And when you have broken the fetters
      that now bind you, we shall see something one of these days. And now       "
    
    
      But at this moment Norbert's eyes caught a glimpse of the old-fashioned
      cuckoo clock that hung on the wall in one corner of the room. He started
      to his feet.
    
    
      "Why, it is dinner-time!" said he. "What upon earth will my father say?"
    
    
      "What, does he keep you in such order as that?"
    
    
      But, never heeding the sarcastic question of the Counsellor, Norbert had
      regained his cart, and was driving off at full speed.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER III.
    
    
      A BOLD ADVENTURE.
    
    
      Daumon had in no way exaggerated when he said that Norbert was spoken of
      as the "Young Savage of Champdoce," though no one used this appellation in
      an insulting form. Public opinion had changed considerably regarding the
      Duke of Champdoce. The first time that he had made his appearance, wearing
      wooden shoes and a leathern jacket, every one had laughed, but this did
      not affect him at all, and in the end people began to term his dogged
      obstinacy indomitable perseverance. The gleam that shone from his hoarded
      millions imparted a brilliant lustre to his shabby garments. Why should
      they waste their pity upon a man who would eventually come into a gigantic
      fortune, and have the means of gratifying all his desires?
    
    
      Mothers, with daughters especially, took a great interest in the young
      man, for to get a girl married to the "Young Savage of Champdoce" would be
      a feat to be proud of; but unluckily his father watched him with all the
      vigilance of a Spanish duenna. But there was a young girl who had long
      since secretly formed a design of her own, and this bold-hearted beauty
      was Diana de Laurebourg. It was with perfect justice that she had received
      the name of the "Belle of Poitiers." She was tall and very fair, with a
      dazzling complexion and masses of lustrous hair; but her eyes gleamed with
      a suppressed fire, which plainly showed the constitution of her nature.
      She had been brought up in a convent, and her parents, who had wished her
      to take the veil, had only been induced to remove her owing to her
      obstinate refusal to pronounce the vows, coupled with the earnest
      entreaties of the lady superior, who was kept in a constant state of
      ferment owing to the mutinous conduct of her pupil. Her father was
      wealthy, but all the property went over to her brother, ten years older
      than herself; and so Diana was portionless, with the exception of a paltry
      sum of forty thousand francs.
    
    
      "My child!" said her father to her the first day of her return, "you have
      come back to us once more, and now all you have to do is to fascinate some
      gentleman who is your equal in position and who has plenty of money. If
      you fail in that, back you go to the convent."
    
    
      "Time enough to talk about that some years hence," answered the girl with
      a smile; "at present I am quite contented with being at home with you."
    
    
      M. de Laurebourg had commented with some severity upon the conduct of the
      Duke de Champdoce towards his son, but he was perfectly willing to
      sacrifice his daughter's heart for a suitable marriage.
    
    
      "I shall gain my end," murmured the girl, "I am sure of it."
    
    
      She had heard a friend of her father's speaking of Norbert and his
      colossal expectations.
    
    
      "Why should I not marry him?" she asked of her own heart; and, with the
      utmost skill, she applied herself to the execution of her design; for the
      idea of being a duchess, with an income of two hundred thousand francs,
      was a most fascinating one. But how was she to meet Norbert? And how bring
      over the money-raking Duke to her side? Before, however, she could decide
      on any plan, she felt that she must see Norbert. He was pointed out to her
      one day at Mass, and she was struck by his beauty and by an ease of manner
      which even his shabby dress could not conceal. By the quick perception
      which many women possess, she dived into Norbert's inmost soul; she felt
      that he had suffered, and her sympathy for him brought with it the dawn of
      love, and by the time she had left the chapel she had registered a solemn
      vow that she would one day be Norbert's wife. But she did not acquaint her
      parents with this determination on her part, preferring to carry out her
      plans without any aid or advice. Mademoiselle Diana was shrewd and
      practical, and not likely to err from want of judgment. The frank and open
      expression of her features concealed a mind of superior calibre, and one
      which well knew how to weigh the advantages of social rank and position.
      She affected a sudden sympathy with the poor, and visited them constantly,
      and might be frequently met in the lanes carrying soup and other comforts
      to them. Her father declared, with a laugh, that she ought to have been a
      Sister of Charity, and did not notice the fact that all Diana's pensioners
      resided in the vicinity of Champdoce. But it was in vain that she wandered
      about, continually changing the hour of her visits. The "Savage of
      Champdoce" was not to be seen, nor was he even a regular attendant at
      Mass. At last a mere trifle changed the whole current of the young man's
      existence; for, a week after the conversation in which the Duke had laid
      bare his scheme to his son, he again referred to it, after their dinner,
      which they had partaken of at the same table with forty laborers, who had
      been hired to get in the harvest.
    
    
      "You need not, my son," began the old gentleman, "go back with the
      laborers to-day."
    
    
      "But, sir       "
    
    
      "Allow me to continue, if you please. My confidential conversation with
      you the other night was merely a preliminary to my telling you that for
      the future I did not expect you to toil as hard as you had hitherto done,
      for I wish you to perform a duty less laborious, but more responsible; you
      will for the future act as farm-bailiff."
    
    
      Norbert looked up suddenly into his father's face.
    
    
      "For I wish you to become accustomed to independent action, so that at my
      death your sudden liberty may not intoxicate you."
    
    
      The Duke then rose from his seat, and took a highly finished gun from a
      cupboard.
    
    
      "I have been very much pleased with you for some time past," said he, "and
      this is a sign of my satisfaction. The gamekeeper has brought in a
      thoroughly trained dog, which will also be yours. Shoot as much as you
      like, and, as you cannot go about without money in your pocket, take this,
      but be careful of it; for remember that extravagance on your part will
      procrastinate the day upon which our descendants will resume their proper
      station in the world."
    
    
      The Duke spoke for some time longer, but his son paid no heed to his
      words, and was too much astonished to accept the six five-franc pieces
      which his father tendered to him.
    
    
      "I suppose," said the Duke at last in angry accents, "that you will have
      the grace to thank me."
    
    
      "You will find that I am not ungrateful," stammered Norbert, aroused by
      this reproach.
    
    
      The Duke turned away impatiently.
    
    
      "What has the boy got into his head now?" muttered he.
    
    
      It was owing to the advice of the priest of Bevron that the Duke had acted
      as he had done; but this indulgence came too late, for Norbert's
      detestation of his tyrant was too deeply buried in his heart to be easily
      eradicated.
    
    
      A gun was not such a wonderful present after all       a matter of a few
      francs, perhaps. Had the Duke offered him the means of a better education,
      it would be a different matter; but as it was, he would still remain the
      "Young Savage of Champdoce."
    
    
      However, Norbert took advantage of the permission accorded to him, and
      rambled daily over the estate with his gun and his dog Bruno, to which he
      had become very much attached. His thoughts often wandered to Daumon; but
      he had made inquiries, and had heard that the Counsellor was a most
      dangerous man, who would stick at nothing; but for all that, he had made
      up his mind to go back to him again for further advice, though his better
      nature warned him of the precipice on the brink of which he was standing.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER IV.
    
    
      A FINANCIAL TRANSACTION.
    
    
      Daumon was expecting a visit from the young man, and had been waiting for
      him with the cool complacency of a bird-catcher, who, having arranged all
      his lines and snares, stands with folded arms until his feathered victims
      fall into his net. The line that he had displayed before the young man's
      eyes was the sight of liberty. Daumon had emissaries everywhere, and knew
      perfectly well what was going on at the Chateau de Champdoce, and could
      have repeated the exact words made use of by the Duke in his last
      conversation with his son, and was aware of the leave of liberty that had
      been granted to Norbert, and was as certain as possible that this small
      concession would only hasten the rebellion of the young Marquis.
    
    
      He often took his evening stroll in the direction of Champdoce, and, pipe
      in mouth, would meditate over his schemes. Pausing on the brow of a hill
      that overlooked the Chateau, he would shake his fist, and mutter,       
    
    
      "He will come; ah, yes, he must come to me!"
    
    
      And he was in the right, for, after a week spent in indecision, Norbert
      knocked at the door of his father's bitterest enemy. Daumon, concealed
      behind the window curtain, had watched his approach, and it was with the
      same air of deference that he had welcomed the Marquis, as he took care to
      call him; but he affected to be so overcome by the honor of this visit
      that he could only falter out,       
    
    
      "Marquis, I am your most humble servant."
    
    
      And Norbert, who had expected a very warm greeting, was much disconcerted.
      For a moment he thought of going away again, but his pride would not
      permit him to do so, for he had said to himself that it would be an act of
      a fool to go away this time without having accomplished anything.
    
    
      "I want to have a bit of advice from you, Counsellor," said he; "for as I
      have but little experience in a certain matter, I should like to avail
      myself of your knowledge."
    
    
      "You do me too much honor, Marquis," murmured the Counsellor with a low
      bow.
    
    
      "But surely," said the young man, "you must feel that you are bound to
      assist me after all you told me a day or two back. You mentioned two means
      by which I could regain my freedom, and hinted that there was a third one.
      I have come to you to-day to ask you what it was."
    
    
      Never did any man more successfully assume an air of astonishment than did
      Daumon at this moment.
    
    
      "What," said he, "do you absolutely remember those idle words I made use
      of then?"
    
    
      "I do most decidedly."
    
    
      The villain's heart of Daumon was filled with delight, but he replied,       
    
    
      "Oh, Marquis! you must remember that we say many things that really have
      no special meaning, for between act and intention there is a tremendous
      difference. I often speak too freely, and that has more than once got me
      into trouble."
    
    
      Norbert was no fool, in spite of his want of education, and the hot blood
      of his ancestors coursed freely through his veins. He now struck the
      butt-end of his gun heavily upon the floor.
    
    
      "You treated me like a simpleton, then, it appears?" remarked he angrily.
    
    
      "My dear Marquis       "
    
    
      "And imagined that you could trifle with me. You managed to learn my real
      feelings for your own amusement; but, take care; this may cost you more
      than you think."
    
    
      "Ah, Marquis, can you believe that I would act so basely?"
    
    
      "What else can I think?"
    
    
      Daumon paused for a moment, and then said,       
    
    
      "You will be angry when you hear what I have to say, but I cannot help
      speaking the truth."
    
    
      "I shall not be angry, and you can speak freely."
    
    
      "I am but a very poor and humble man. What have I to gain by securing any
      note, and by encouraging you to brave your father's anger? Just think what
      must happen if I opposed the all-powerful Duke de Champdoce; why, I might
      find myself in prison in next to no time."
    
    
      "And for what reason, if you please?" asked Norbert.
    
    
      "Have you never studied law in the slightest degree, Marquis? Dear me, how
      neglectful some parents are! You are not of age, and there is a certain
      article, 354 in the code, that could be so worked that a poor humble
      creature like me could be locked up for perhaps five years. The law deals
      very hardly when any one has dealings with a minor, the more especially
      when the father is a man of untold wealth. If the Duke should ever
      discover              "
    
    
      "But how could he ever do so?"
    
    
      Daumon made no reply, and his silence so plainly showed Norbert that the
      Counsellor did not trust him, that he repeated the question in an angry
      voice.
    
    
      "Your blind subservience to your father is too well known."
    
    
      "You believe that I should confess everything to him?"
    
    
      "You yourself told me that when his eyes were fixed on yours you could not
      avoid yielding to his will."
    
    
      Norbert's anger gradually died away, as he replied in accents of intense
      bitterness,       
    
    
      "I may be a savage, but I am not likely to become a traitor. If I once
      promised to keep a secret, no measures or tortures would tear it from me.
      I may fear my father, but I am a Champdoce, and fear no other mortal man.
      Do you understand me?"
    
    
      "But, Marquis       "
    
    
      "No other mortal man," interrupted Norbert sternly, "will ever know from
      me that we have ever exchanged words together."
    
    
      An expression passed over the features of the Counsellor which cast a ray
      of hope upon the young man's heart.
    
    
      "Upon my word," said he, "any one would judge from my hesitation that I
      had some wrong motive in acting as I am doing, but I never give bad
      advice, and any one will tell you the same about me, and this is the
      breviary by which I regulate all my actions."
    
    
      As he spoke, he took a book from his desk, and waved it aloft.
    
    
      Norbert looked puzzled and angry.
    
    
      "What do you mean?" asked he.
    
    
      "Nothing, Marquis, nothing; have patience; your majority is not far off,
      and you have only a few years to wait. Remember that your father is an old
      man; let him carry out his plan for a few years longer, and              "
    
    
      Norbert struck his fist savagely upon the table, crying out furiously. "It
      was not worth my coming here if this was all that you had to say;" and,
      whistling to Bruno, the young man prepared to quit the room.
    
    
      "Ah, Marquis! you are far too hasty," said the Counsellor humbly.
    
    
      Norbert paused. "Speak then," answered he roughly.
    
    
      In a low, impressive voice, Daumon went on.
    
    
      "Remember, Marquis, that though I should like to see you have a better
      understanding with your father, yet, at the same time, I should like to
      work for the happiness of you both. I am like a judge in court, who
      endeavors to bring about a compromise between the litigants. Can you not,
      while affecting perfect submission, live in a manner more suited to you?
      There are many young men of your age in a precisely similar position."
    
    
      Norbert took a step forward and began to listen earnestly.
    
    
      "You have more liberty now," continued Daumon. "Pray, does your father
      know how you employ your time?"
    
    
      "He knows that I can do nothing but shoot."
    
    
      "Well, I know what I would do if I were your age."
    
    
      "And what would that be?"
    
    
      "First of all, I would stay at home sufficiently often not to arouse
      papa's suspicions, and the rest of my leisure I would spend in Poitiers,
      which is a very pleasant town. I could take nice rooms in which I could be
      my own master. At Champdoce I could keep to my peasant's clothes, but in
      Poitiers I would be dressed by the best tailor. I should pick up a few
      boon companions amongst the jolly students, and have plenty of friends,
      ladies as well as gentlemen. I would dance, sing, and drink, and would dip
      into every kind of life, so that              "
    
    
      He paused for a second and then said, "There ought to be a fast horse or
      so in your father's stables, eh? Well then, if there are, why not take one
      for your own riding? Then at night, when you are supposed to be snug
      between the sheets, creep down to the stable, clap a bridle on the horse,
      and, hey, presto! you are in Poitiers. Put on the clothes suitable to the
      handsome young noble you are, and have a joyous carouse with your many
      companions; and if you do, next day, not choose to go back until the
      morning, the servants will only tell your father that you are out
      shooting."
    
    
      Norbert was a thoroughly strong, honest youth, and the idea of meanness
      and duplicity were most repugnant to his feelings in general; and yet he
      listened eagerly to this proposition, for oppression had utterly changed
      his nature. The career of dissipation and pleasure proposed so adroitly by
      Daumon dazzled his imagination and his eyes began to sparkle.
    
    
      "Well," asked the Counsellor invidiously, "and, pray, what is there to
      prevent you doing all this?"
    
    
      "Want of funds," returned Norbert, with a deep sigh; "I should want a
      great deal, and I have hardly any; if I were to ask my father for any, he
      would refuse me, and wonder              "
    
    
      "Have you no friends who would find you such a sum as you would require
      until you came of age?"
    
    
      "None at all;" and, overwhelmed with the sense of his utter helplessness,
      Norbert sank back upon a chair.
    
    
      After a brief period of reflection, Daumon spoke with apparent reluctance,       
    
    
      "No, Marquis, I cannot see you so miserably unhappy without doing my best
      to help you. A man is a fool who puts out his hand to interfere between
      father and son, but I will find money to lend you what you want."
    
    
      "Will you do so, Counsellor?"
    
    
      "Unluckily I cannot, I am only a poor fellow, but some of the neighboring
      farmers intrust me with their savings for investment. Why should I not use
      them to make you comfortable and happy?"
    
    
      Norbert was almost choked with emotion. "Can this be done?" asked he
      eagerly.
    
    
      "Yes, Marquis; but you understand that you will have to pay very heavy
      interest on account of the risk incurred in lending money to a minor. For
      the law does not recognize such transactions, and I myself do not like
      them. If I were in your place, I would not borrow money on these terms,
      but wait until some friend could help me."
    
    
      "I have no friends," again answered the young man.
    
    
      Daumon shrugged his shoulders with the air of a man who says: "Well, I
      suppose I must give in, but at any rate I have done my duty." Then he
      began aloud, "I am perfectly aware, Marquis, that, considering the wealth
      that must one day be yours, this transaction is a most paltry one."
    
    
      He then went on to enumerate the conditions of the loan, and at each
      clause he would stop and say, "Do you understand this?"
    
    
      Norbert understood him so well that at the end of the conversation, in
      exchange for the thousand francs, he handed to the Counsellor the
      promissory notes for four thousand francs each, which were made payable to
      two farmers, who were entirely in Daumon's clutches. The young man, in
      addition, pledged his solemn word of honor that he would never disclose
      that the Counsellor had anything to do with the transaction.
    
    
      "Remember, Marquis, prudence must be strictly observed. Come here to me
      only after the night has set in."
    
    
      This was the last piece of advice that Daumon gave his client; and when he
      was again left alone, he perused with feelings of intense gratification,
      the two notes that Norbert had signed. They were entirely correct and
      binding, and drawn up in proper legal form. He had made up his mind to let
      the young man have all his savings, amounting to some forty thousand
      francs, and not to press for payment until the young man come into his
      fortune.
    
    
      All this, however, hinged upon Norbert's silence and discretion, for, at
      the first inkling of the matter, the Duke would scatter all the edifice to
      the winds; but of this happening Daumon had no fear.
    
    
      As Norbert walked along, followed by his dog, he could not resist putting
      his hands into his pockets and fingering the tempting, crisp banknotes
      which lurked there, and making sure that it was a reality and not a dream.
      That night seemed interminable; and the next morning, with his gun on his
      shoulder and his dog at his heels, he walked briskly along the road to
      Poitiers. He had determined to follow Daumon's advice,       to have
      suitable rooms, and to make the acquaintance of some of the students. On
      his arrival at Poitiers, which he had only once before visited, Norbert
      felt like a half-fledged bird who knows not how to use its wings. He
      wandered about the streets, not knowing how to commence what he wanted.
      Finally, after a sojourn in the town of a very brief duration, he went to
      the inn where he had breakfasted with his father on his former visit, and,
      after an unsatisfactory meal, returned to Champdoce, as wretched as he had
      been joyful and hopeful at his early start in the morning. But later on he
      went to Daumon, who put him in communication with a friend who, for a
      commission, took the unsophisticated lad about, hired some furnished
      rooms, and finally introduced him to the best ladies in the town, while
      Norbert ordered clothes to the tune of five hundred francs. He now thought
      himself on the high road to the full gratification of his desires; but,
      alas! the reality, compared with what his imagination had pictured,
      appeared rank and chilling. His timidity and shyness arrested all his
      progress; he required an intimate friend, and where could he hit upon one?
    
    
      One evening he entered the Café Castille. He found a large number of
      students collected there, and was a little disgusted at their turbulent
      gayety, and, hastily withdrawing, he spent the rest of the weary evening
      in his own rooms with Bruno, who, for his part, would have much preferred
      the open country. He had really only enjoyed the four evenings on which he
      had visited the Martre; but these limited hours of happiness did not make
      up for the web of falsehood in which he had enmeshed himself, or the daily
      dread of detection in which he lived.
    
    
      The Duke had noticed his son's absence, but his suspicions were very wide
      of the truth. One morning he laughed at Norbert on the continued
      non-success of his shooting.
    
    
      "Do your best to-day, my boy," said he, "and try and bring home some game,
      for we shall have a guest to dinner."
    
    
      "To dinner, here?"
    
    
      "Yes," answered the Duke suppressing a smile. "Yes, actually here; M.
      Puymandour is coming, and the dining-room must be opened and put into
      proper order."
    
    
      "I will try and kill some game," answered Norbert to himself as he started
      on his errand.
    
    
      This, however, was more easily resolved on than executed. At last he
      caught sight of an impudent rabbit near a hedge; he raised his gun and
      fired. A shriek of anguish followed the report, and Bruno dashed into the
      hedge, barking furiously.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER V.
    
    
      A BAD START.
    
    
      Diana de Laurebourg was a strange compound; under an appearance of the
      most artless simplicity she concealed an iron will, and had hidden from
      every one of her family, and even from her most intimate friends, her firm
      resolve to become the Duchess of Champdoce. All her rambles in the
      neighborhood had turned out of no avail; and as the weather was now very
      uncertain, it seemed as if her long strolls in the country roads and
      fields would soon come to an end. "The day must eventually come," murmured
      she, "when this invisible prince must make his appearance." And at last
      the long-expected day arrived.
    
    
      It was in the middle of the month of November, and the weather was
      exceedingly soft and balmy for the time of year. The sky was blue, the few
      remaining leaves rustled on the trees, and an occasional bird whistled in
      the hedgerows. Diana de Laurebourg was walking slowly along the path
      leading to Mussidan, when all at once she heard a rustling of branches.
      She turned round sharply, and all the blood in her body seemed to rush
      suddenly to her heart, for through an opening in the hedge she caught
      sight of the man who for the past two months had occupied all her waking
      thoughts. Norbert was waiting for something with all the eagerness of a
      sportsman, his finger on the trigger of his gun.
    
    
      Here was the opportunity for which she had waited so long, and with such
      ill-concealed impatience; and yet she could derive no advantage from it,
      for what would happen? Simply this: Norbert would bow to her, and she
      would reply with a slight inclination of her head, and perhaps two months
      might pass away before she met him again. Just as she was about to take
      some bold and decisive step she saw Norbert raise his gun and point it in
      her direction. She endeavored to call out to him, but her voice failed
      her, and in another moment the report rang out, and she felt a sharp pang,
      like the touch of a red-hot iron upon her ankle. With a wild shriek she
      threw up her arms and fell upon the pathway. She did not lose her senses,
      for she heard a cry in response to her own, and the crashing of something
      forcing its way through the hedge. Then she felt a hot breath upon her
      face, and then something cold and wet touched her cheek. She opened her
      eyes languidly, and saw Bruno licking her face and hands.
    
    
      At the same moment Norbert dashed through the hedge and stood before her.
      At once she realized the advantage of her position and closed her eyes
      once more. Norbert, as he hung over the seemingly unconscious form of this
      fair young creature, felt that his senses were deserting him, for he
      greatly feared that he had killed Mademoiselle de Laurebourg. His first
      impulse was to fly precipitately, and his second to give what aid he could
      to his victim. He knelt down by her, and, to his infinite relief, found
      that life was not extinct. He raised her beautiful head.
    
    
      "Speak to me, mademoiselle, I entreat you," cried he.
    
    
      All this time Diana was returning thanks to kind Providence for the
      fulfillment of her wishes. After a time she made a slight move, and
      Norbert uttered an exclamation of joy. Then, opening her beautiful eyes,
      she gazed upon the young man with the air of a person just awaking from a
      dream.
    
    
      "It is I," faltered the distracted young man. "Norbert de Champdoce. But
      forgive me, and tell me if you are in pain?"
    
    
      Pity came over the wounded girl. She gently drew herself away from the arm
      that encircled her, and said softly,       
    
    
      "It is I who ought to apologize for my foolish weakness; for I am really
      more frightened than hurt."
    
    
      Norbert felt that heaven had opened before his very eyes. "Let me go for
      help," exclaimed he.
    
    
      "No, no; it was a mere scratch." And, raising her skirt, she displayed a
      foot that might have turned a steadier head than Norbert's. "See," said
      she, "it is there that I am in pain."
    
    
      And she pointed to a spot of blood upon the delicate white stocking. At
      the sight of this the young man's terror increased, and he started to his
      feet.
    
    
      "Let me run to the Chateau," said he, "and in less than an hour       "
    
    
      "Do nothing of the kind," interrupted the girl; "it is a mere nothing.
      Look, I can move my foot with ease."
    
    
      "But let me entreat you       "
    
    
      "Hush! we shall soon see what it is that has happened." And she inspected
      what she laughingly termed his terrible wound.
    
    
      It was, as she had supposed, a mere nothing. One pellet had grazed the
      skin, another had lodged in the flesh, but it was quite on the surface.
    
    
      "A surgeon must see to this," said Norbert.
    
    
      "No, no." And with the point of a penknife she pulled out the little
      leaden shot. The young man remained still, holding his breath, as a child
      does when he is putting the topmost story on a house of cards. He had
      never heard so soft a voice, never gazed on so perfectly lovely a face. In
      the meantime Diana had torn up her handkerchief and bandaged the wound.
      "Now that is over," exclaimed she, with a light laugh, as she extended her
      slender fingers to Norbert, so that he might assist her to rise.
    
    
      As soon as she was on her feet, she took a few steps with the prettiest
      limp imaginable.
    
    
      "Are you in pain?" said he anxiously.
    
    
      "No, I am not indeed; and by this evening I shall have forgotten all about
      it. But confess, Marquis," she added, with a coquettish laugh, "that this
      is a droll way of making an acquaintance."
    
    
      Norbert started at the word Marquis, for no one but Daumon had ever
      addressed him thus.
    
    
      "She does not despise me," thought he.
    
    
      "This little incident will be a lesson to me," continued she. "Mamma
      always has told me to keep to the highroad; but I preferred the by-paths
      because of the lovely scenery."
    
    
      Norbert, for the first time in his life, realized that the view was a
      beautiful one.
    
    
      "I am this way nearly every day," pursued Diana, "though I am very wicked
      to disobey my mother. I go to see poor La Berven. She is dying of
      consumption, poor thing, and I take her a little soup and wine every now
      and then."
    
    
      She spoke like a real Sister of Mercy, and, in Norbert's opinion, wings
      only were lacking to transform her into a perfect angel.
    
    
      "The poor woman has three children, and their father does nothing for
      them, for he drinks what he earns," the young girl went on.
    
    
      Berven was one of the identical men to whom Norbert had given his
      promissory note for four thousand francs, for he was one of the two men
      who had intrusted Daumon with their savings for investment; but the young
      man was not in a condition to notice this. Diana had meantime slung her
      basket on her arm.
    
    
      "Before I leave you to-day," said she, "I should so much like to ask a
      favor of you."
    
    
      "A favor of me, mademoiselle?"
    
    
      "Yes; oblige me by saying nothing of what has occurred to-day to any one;
      for should it come to my parents' ears, they would undoubtedly deprive me
      of the little liberty that they now grant me."
    
    
      "Mademoiselle," answered Norbert, "be sure that I will never mention the
      terrible accident that my awkwardness has caused."
    
    
      "Thank you, Marquis," answered the girl, with a half-mocking courtesy.
      "Another time let me advise you, before you shoot, to look that no one is
      behind a hedge."
    
    
      With these words she tripped away, without her tiny feet showing any signs
      of lameness. She had read Norbert's heart like the pages of a book, and
      felt that there was every chance of her winning the game. "I am sure of it
      now," said she; "I shall be the Duchess of Champdoce." How grateful she
      felt for that untimely shot! And she felt sure that Norbert had understood
      what she meant when she had said that she went along that path. She felt
      certain that the young man had not lost one word. She believed that the
      only opposition would come from his father. As she looked round for a
      moment, she saw Norbert standing fixed and motionless as the trees around
      him.
    
    
      After Diana had departed, the unhappy lad felt as if she had taken half
      his life with her. Was it all a dream? He knelt down, and, after a slight
      search, discovered the little pellet, the cause of all the mischief; and,
      taking it up carefully, returned home. To his extreme surprise, he found
      the main gateway wide open, and from a window he heard his father's voice
      calling out in kindly accents,       
    
    
      "Come up quickly, my boy, for our guest has arrived."
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER VI.
    
    
      THE COUNT DE PUYMANDOUR.
    
    
      Since the death of the Duchess of Champdoce the greater portion of the
      Chateau had been closed, but the reception rooms were always ready to be
      used at a very short notice.
    
    
      The dining-room was a really magnificent apartment. There were massive
      buffets of carved oak, black with age, ornamented with brass mountings.
      The shelves groaned beneath their load of goblets and salvers of the
      brightest silver, engraved with the haughty armorial bearings of the house
      of Champdoce.
    
    
      Standing near one of the windows, Norbert saw a man, stout, robust, bald
      and red-faced, wearing a mustache and slight beard. His clothes were
      evidently made by a first-rate tailor, but his appearance was utterly
      commonplace.
    
    
      "This is my son," said the Duke, "the Marquis de Champdoce. Marquis, let
      me introduce you to the Count de Puymandour."
    
    
      This was the first time that his father had ever addressed Norbert by his
      title, and he was greatly surprised. The great clock in the outer hall,
      which had not been going for fifteen years, now struck, and instantly a
      butler appeared, bearing a massive silver soup tureen, which he placed on
      the table, announcing solemnly that his Grace was served, and the little
      party at once seated themselves. A dinner in such a vast chamber would
      have been rather dull had it not been enlivened by the amusing tales and
      witty anecdotes of the Count de Puymandour, which he narrated in a jovial
      but rather vulgar manner, seasoned with bursts of laughter. He ate with an
      excellent appetite, and praised the quality of the wine, which the Duke
      himself had chosen from the cellar, which he had filled with an immense
      stock for the benefit of his descendants. The Duke, who was generally so
      silent and morose, smiled buoyantly, and appeared to enjoy the
      pleasantries of his guest. Was this only the duty of the host, or did his
      geniality conceal some hidden scheme? Norbert was utterly unable to settle
      this question, for though not gifted with much penetration, he had studied
      his father's every look as a slave studies his master, and knew exactly
      what annoyed and what pleased him.
    
    
      The Count de Puymandour lived in a magnificent house, with his daughter
      Marie, about three miles from Champdoce, and he was exceedingly fond of
      entertaining; but the gentry, who did not for a moment decline to accept
      his grand dinners, did not hesitate to say that Puymandour was a thief and
      a rogue. Had he been convicted of larceny, he could not have been spoken
      of with more disdainful contempt. But he was very wealthy, and possessed
      at least five millions of francs. Of course this was an excellent reason
      for hating him, but the fact was, that Puymandour was a very worthy man,
      and had made his money by speculation in wool on the Spanish frontier. For
      a long period he had lived happy and respected in his native town of
      Orthez, when all at once he was tempted by the thought of titular rank,
      and from that time his life was one long misery. He took the name of one
      of his estates, he bought his title in Italy, and ordered his coat-of-arms
      from a heraldic agent in Paris, and now his ambition was to be treated as
      a real nobleman. The mere fact of dining with the eccentric Duke de
      Champdoce, who never invited any one to his table, was to him, as it were,
      a real patent of nobility.
    
    
      At ten o'clock he rose and declared he must leave, and the Duke escorted
      him the length of the avenue to the great gates opening on the main road,
      and Norbert, who walked a few paces in the rear, caught now and then a few
      words of their conversation.
    
    
      "Yes," remarked Puymandour, "I will give a million down."
    
    
      Then came a few words from the Duke, of which Norbert could only catch the
      words, "thousands and millions."
    
    
      He paid, however, but little attention, for his mind was many miles away.
      Since the unlooked-for meeting with that fair young face, he had thought
      of nothing else, and he mechanically shook hands with, and bade his guest
      "Good-night" when his father did.
    
    
      When the Duke was sure that M. de Puymandour could not hear his voice, he
      took his son by the arm, and the bitterness of feeling which he had so
      long repressed burst forth in words.
    
    
      "This," said he, "is a specimen of the mushroom aristocracy that has
      sprung up, and not a bad sample either; for though he is puffed up by
      ridiculous vanity, the man is shrewd and intelligent enough, and his
      descendants, who will have the advantages of a better education than their
      progenitors, will form a new class, with more wealth and as much influence
      as the old one."
    
    
      For more than an hour the Duke de Champdoce enlarged on his favorite
      topic; but he might as well have been alone, for his son paid no attention
      to what he said, for his mind was still dwelling upon his adventures of
      the morning. Again that sweet, soft laugh, and that modulated voice rang
      in his ears. How foolish he must have seemed to her! and what a ridiculous
      figure he must have cut in her eyes! He had by no means omitted to engrave
      on the tablet of his memory the fact that Diana passed daily down the
      little path on her errand of bounty, and that there he had the chance of
      again seeing her. He fancied that he had so much to say to her; but as he
      found that his bashfulness would deprive him of the power of utterance, he
      determined to commit his sentiments to paper. That night he composed and
      destroyed some fifty letters. He did not dare to say openly, "I love you,"
      and yet that was exactly what he wanted to express, and he strove, but in
      vain, to find words which would veil its abruptness and yet disclose the
      whole strength of his feelings. At last, however, one of his efforts
      satisfied him. Rising early, he snatched up his gun, and whistling to
      Bruno, made his way to the spot where he had the day before seen Diana
      stretched upon the ground. But he waited in vain, and hour after hour
      passed away, as he paced up and down in an agony of suspense. Diana did
      not come. The young lady had considered her plans thoroughly and kept
      away. The next day he might have been again disappointed but for a lucky
      circumstance. Norbert was seated on the turf, awaiting with fond
      expectation the young girl's approach and as Diana passed the opening to
      the pathway Bruno scented her, and rushed forward with a joyous bark. She
      had then no option but to walk up to the spot where Norbert was seated.
      Both the young people were for the moment equally embarrassed, and Norbert
      stood silent, holding in his hand the letter which had caused him so much
      labor to indite.
    
    
      "I have ventured to wait for you here, mademoiselle," said he in a voice
      which trembled with suppressed emotion, "because I was full of anxiety to
      know how you have been. How did you contrive to return home with your
      wounded foot?"
    
    
      He paused, awaiting a word of encouragement, but the girl made no reply,
      and he continued,       
    
    
      "I was tempted to call and make inquiries at your father's house, but you
      had forbidden me to speak of the accident, and I did not dare to disobey
      you."
    
    
      "I thank you sincerely," faltered Diana.
    
    
      "Yesterday," the young man went on, "I passed the whole day here. Are you
      angry with me for my stupidity? I had thought that perhaps you had noticed
      my anxiety, and might have deigned to              "
    
    
      He stopped short, terrified at his own audacity.
    
    
      "Yesterday," returned Diana with the most ingenuous air in the world, and
      not appearing to perceive the young man's embarrassment, "I was detained
      at home by my mother."
    
    
      "Yes," replied he, "for the past two days your form, lying senseless and
      bleeding on the ground, has ever been before my eyes, for I felt as if I
      were a murderer. I shall always see your pale, white face, and how, when I
      raised up your head it rested on my arm for a moment, and all the rapture       "
    
    
      "You must not talk like that, Marquis," interrupted Diana, but she spoke
      in such a low tone that Norbert did not hear her and went on,       
    
    
      "When I saw you yesterday my feelings so overpowered me that I could not
      put them into words; but as soon as you had left me, it appeared as if all
      grew dark around me, and throwing myself on my knees, I searched for the
      tiny leaden pellet that might have caused your death. I at last found it,
      and no treasure upon earth will ever be more prized by me."
    
    
      To avoid showing the gleam of joy that flashed from her eyes, Diana was
      compelled to turn her head on one side.
    
    
      "Forgive me, mademoiselle," said Norbert, in despair, as he noticed this
      movement; "forgive me if I have offended you. Could you but know how
      dreary my past life has been, you would pardon me. It seemed to me, the
      very moment that I saw you, I had found a woman who would feel some slight
      interest in me, and that for her sweet compassion I would devote my whole
      life to her. But now I see how mad and foolish I have been, and I am
      plunged into the depths 'of despair.'"
    
    
      She accompanied these words with a glance sufficiently tender to restore
      all Norbert's courage.
    
    
      "Ah, mademoiselle," said he; "do not trifle with me, for that would be too
      cruel."
    
    
      She let her head droop on her bosom, and, falling upon his knees, he
      poured a stream of impassioned kisses upon her hands. Diana felt herself
      swept away by this stream of passion; she gasped, and her fingers
      trembled, as she found that she was trapped in the same snare that she had
      set for another. Her reason warned her that she must bring this dangerous
      interview to a conclusion.
    
    
      "I am forgetting all about my poor pensioners," said she.
    
    
      "Ah, if I might but accompany you!"
    
    
      "And so you may, but you must walk fast."
    
    
      It is quite true that great events spring from very trivial sources; and
      had Diana gone to visit La Besson, Norbert might have heard something
      concerning Daumon that would have put him on his guard; but,
      unfortunately, to-day Diana was bound on a visit to an old woman in
      another part of the parish.
    
    
      Norbert looked on whilst this fair young creature busied herself in her
      work of charity, and then he silently placed two louis from the money he
      had borrowed, on the table, and left the cottage. Diana followed him, and,
      laying her finger upon her lips with the significant word "to-morrow,"
      turned down the path that led to her father's house. Norbert could hardly
      believe his senses when he found himself again alone. Yes, this lovely
      girl had almost confessed her affection for him, and he was ready to pour
      out his life blood for her. He tore up the letter which had cost him so
      much trouble to compose, for he felt that he could make no use of it. He
      had now no anxieties regarding the future, and he thanked Providence for
      having caused him to meet Diana de Laurebourg. It never entered his brain
      that this apparently frank and open-hearted girl had materially furthered
      the acts of Providence. At supper that night he was so gay, and in such
      excellent spirits, that even his father's attention was at last attracted.
    
    
      "I would lay a wager, my boy," remarked the Duke, "that you have had a
      good day's sport."
    
    
      "You would win your wager," answered the young man boldly.
    
    
      His father did not pursue the subject; but as Norbert felt that he must
      give some color to his assertion, he stopped the next day, and purchased
      some quails and a hare. He waited fully half an hour for Diana; and when
      she did appear, her pale face and the dark marks under her eyes showed
      that anxiety had caused her to pass a sleepless night.
    
    
      No sooner had she parted from Norbert than she saw the risk that she was
      running by her imprudent conduct. She was endangering her whole future and
      her reputation,       all indeed that is most precious to a young girl.
      For an instant the thought of confiding all to her parents entered her
      brain; but she rejected the idea almost as soon as she had conceived it,
      for she felt that her father would believe that the parsimonious Duke de
      Champdoce would never consent to such a marriage, and that her entire
      liberty would be taken from her, and that she might even be sent back to
      the convent.
    
    
      "I cannot stop now," she murmured, "and must be content to run all risks
      to effect an object in which I am now doubly interested."
    
    
      Diana and Norbert had a long conversation together on this day in a spot
      which had become so dear to them both, and it was only the approach of a
      peasant that recalled the girl to the sense of her rash imprudence, and
      she insisted on going on her ostensible errand of charity. Norbert, as
      before, escorted her, and even went so far as to offer his arm, upon which
      she pressed when the road was steep or uneven.
    
    
      These meetings took place daily, and after a few short minutes spent in
      conversation, the young lovers would set off on a ramble. More than once
      they were met by the villagers, and a little scandal began to arise. This
      was very imprudent on Diana's side; but it had been a part of her plan to
      permit her actions to be talked of by the tongue of scandal. Unfortunately
      the end of November was approaching, and the weather growing extremely
      cold. One morning, as Norbert arose from his couch, he found that a sharp
      icy blast was swaying the bare branches of the trees, and that the rain
      was descending in torrents. On such a day as this he knew that it was vain
      to expect Diana, and, with his heart full of sadness, he took up a book
      and sat himself down by the huge fire that blazed in the great hall.
    
    
      Mademoiselle de Laurebourg had, however, gone out, but it was in a
      carriage, and she had driven to a cottage to see a poor woman who had
      broken her leg, and who had nothing but the scanty earnings of her
      daughter Francoise upon which to exist. As soon as Diana entered the
      cottage she saw that something had gone wrong.
    
    
      "What is the matter?" asked she.
    
    
      The poor creature, with garrulous volubility, exhibited a summons which
      she had just received, and said that she owed three hundred francs, and
      that as she could no longer pay the interest, she had been summoned, and
      that her little property would be seized, and so a finishing stroke would
      be put to her troubles.
    
    
      "It is the Counsellor," said she, "that rogue Daumon, who has done all
      this."
    
    
      The poor woman went on to say that when she went to her creditor to
      implore a little delay, he had scoffingly told her to send her pretty
      daughter to him to plead her cause.
    
    
      Mademoiselle de Laurebourg was disgusted at this narrative, and her eyes
      gleamed with anger.
    
    
      "I will see this wicked man," said she, "and will come back to you at
      once."
    
    
      She drove straight to the Counsellor's house. Daumon was engaged in
      writing when the housekeeper ushered Diana into the office. He rose to his
      feet, and, taking off his velvet skull cap, made a profound bow, advancing
      at the same time a chair for his visitor's accommodation.
    
    
      Though Diana knew nothing of this man, she was not so unsophisticated as
      Norbert, and was not imposed upon by the air of servile obsequiousness
      that he assumed. With a gesture of contempt, she declined the proffered
      seat, and this act made Daumon her bitter enemy.
    
    
      "I have come," said she in the cold, disdainful words in which young girls
      of high birth address their inferiors,       "I have come to you from
      Widow Rouleau."
    
    
      "Ah! you know the poor creature then?"
    
    
      "Yes, and I take a great interest in her."
    
    
      "You are a very kind young lady," answered the Counsellor with a sinister
      smile.
    
    
      "The poor woman is in the most terrible distress both of mind and body.
      She is confined to her bed with a fractured limb, and without any means of
      support."
    
    
      "Yes, I heard of her accident."
    
    
      "And yet you sent her a summons, and are ready to seize all she possesses
      in the world."
    
    
      Daumon put on an air of sympathy.
    
    
      "Poor thing!" said he. "How true it is that misfortunes never come
      singly!"
    
    
      Diana was disgusted at the man's cool effrontery.
    
    
      "It seems to me," answered she, "that her last trouble is of your making."
    
    
      "Is it possible?"
    
    
      "Why, who is it but you who are the persecutor of this poor lone
      creature?"
    
    
      "I!" answered he in extreme astonishment; "do you really think that it is
      I? Ah! mademoiselle, why do you listen to the cruel tongues of
      scandal-mongers? To make a long story short, this poor woman bought
      barley, corn, potatoes, and three sheep from a man in the neighborhood,
      who gave her credit to the extent of I daresay three hundred francs. Well,
      in time, the man asked       most naturally       for his money, and
      failing to get it, came to me. I urged him to wait, but he would not
      listen to me, and vowed that if I did not do as he wished he would go to
      some one else. What was I to do? He had the law on his side too. Ah!"
      continued he, as though speaking to himself, "if I could only see a way of
      getting this poor creature out of her trouble! But that cannot be done
      without money."
    
    
      He opened a drawer and pulled out about fifty francs.
    
    
      "This is all my worldly wealth," said he sadly. "But how foolish I am!
      For, of course, when poor Widow Rouleau has a wealthy young lady to take
      an interest in her, she must have no further fear."
    
    
      "I will speak to my father on the matter," answered Diana in a voice which
      showed that she had but little hope of interesting him in the widow's
      misfortunes.
    
    
      Daumon's face fell.
    
    
      "You will go to the Marquis de Laurebourg?" asked he. "Now, if you would
      take my advice, I should say, go to some intimate friend,       to the
      Marquis de Champdoce, for instance. I know," he went on, "that the Duke
      does not make his son a very handsome allowance; but the young gentleman
      will find no difficulty in raising whatever he may desire       as it will
      not be long before he is of age       without counting his marriage, which
      will put an enormous sum at his disposal even before that."
    
    
      Diana fell in an instant into the trap the wily Daumon had laid for her.
    
    
      "A marriage!" exclaimed she.
    
    
      "I know very little about it; only I know that if the young man wishes to
      marry without his father's consent, he will have to wait at least five
      years."
    
    
      "Five years?"
    
    
      "Yes; the law requires that a young man who marries against his father's
      desire should be twenty-five years of age."
    
    
      This last stroke was so totally unexpected, that the girl lost her head.
    
    
      "Impossible!" cried she. "Are you not making a mistake?"
    
    
      The Counsellor gave a quiet smile of triumph.
    
    
      "I am not mistaken," said he, and calmly pointed out in the code the
      provision to which he had alluded. As Diana read the passage to which his
      finger pointed, he watched her as a cat watches a mouse.
    
    
      "After all, what does it matter to me?" remarked Diana, making an effort
      to recover herself. "I will speak about this poor woman's case to my
      father;" and, with her limbs bending under her, she left the room.
    
    
      As Daumon returned from accompanying her to the door, the Counsellor
      rubbed his hands.
    
    
      "Things are getting decidedly warm," muttered he.
    
    
      He felt that he must gain some further information, and this he could not
      get from Norbert. It would be also as well, he thought, to tell the
      sheriff to stay proceedings relative to the Widow Rouleau. By this means
      he might secure another interview with Mademoiselle de Laurebourg, and
      perhaps win the poor girl's confidence.
    
    
      As Diana rode home, she abandoned herself to the grief which the
      intelligence that she had just heard had caused her, for the foresight of
      the framers of the law had rendered all her deeply laid plans of no avail.
    
    
      "The Duke of Champdoce," murmured she to herself, "will never consent to
      his son's marriage with so scantily a dowered woman as I am; but as soon
      as Norbert is of age he can marry me, in spite of all his father's
      opposition; but, oh! 'tis a dreary time to wait."
    
    
      For a moment she dared to think of the possible death of the old man; but
      she shuddered as she remembered how strong and healthy he was, and felt
      that the frail edifice of her hope had been crushed into ten thousand
      atoms. For all this, however, she did not lose courage. She was not one of
      those women who, at the first check, beat a retreat. She had not yet
      decided upon a fresh point of departure, but she had fully made up her
      mind that she would gain the victory. The first thing was to see Norbert
      with as little delay as possible. Just then the carriage pulled up at the
      widow's cottage, which she entered hastily.
    
    
      "I have seen Daumon," said she. "Do not be alarmed; all matters will be
      arranged shortly."
    
    
      Then, without listening to the thanks and blessings which the poor woman
      showered upon her, she said,       
    
    
      "Give me a piece of paper to write on," and, standing near the casement,
      she wrote in pencil on a soiled scrap of paper the following words:       
    
    
      "Diana would, perhaps, have been at the usual meeting place to-day, in
      spite of the weather, had she not been compelled to visit a poor woman in
      a contrary direction. Upon the same business, she will have to call
      to-morrow at the house of a man called Daumon."
    
    
      She folded the note and said,       
    
    
      "This letter must be taken at once to M. Norbert de Champdoce. Who will
      carry it?"
    
    
      Francoise had made a smock frock for one of the farm servants at
      Champdoce, and the delivery of it formed a good excuse for going up to the
      Chateau, and she willingly undertook the errand.
    
    
      The next day, in the midst of a heavy shower of rain, Norbert made his
      appearance at Daumon's office, saying, as a pretext for his visit, that he
      had exhausted his stock of money, and required a fresh supply. He too was
      feeling very unhappy, for he feared that this father might entertain
      matrimonial designs for him which would be utterly opposed to his passion
      for Mademoiselle de Laurebourg.
    
    
      Had not the inexorable old man once said, "You will marry a woman of
      wealth?" But in the event of this matter being brought up, Norbert swore
      that he would no longer be obedient, but would resist to the last; and he
      calculated on receiving assistance from Daumon. He was on the point of
      referring to this matter, when a carriage drew up at the door of the
      cottage, and Mademoiselle de Laurebourg descended from it. Daumon at once
      saw how matters stood, and wasted no time in addressing Diana.
    
    
      "The sheriff will stop proceedings," said he. "I can show you his letter
      to that effect."
    
    
      He turned away, and searched as diligently for the letter as if it had
      existed anywhere except in his own imagination.
    
    
      "Dear me," said he at length. "I cannot find it. I must have left it in
      the other room. I have so much to do, that really there are times when I
      forget everything. I must find it, however. Excuse me, I will be back
      immediately."
    
    
      His sudden departure from the room had been a mere matter of calculation;
      for, guessing that an assignation had been planned, he thought that he
      might know what took place at it by a little eavesdropping. He therefore
      applied first his ear and then his eye to the keyhole, and by these means
      acquired all the information he desired.
    
    
      A moment of privacy with the object of his affections seemed to Norbert an
      inestimable boon. When Diana had first entered, he was horrified at the
      terrible alteration that had taken place in the expression of her face. He
      seized her hand, which she made no effort to withdraw, and gazed fixedly
      into her eyes.
    
    
      "Tell me," murmured he in accents of love and tenderness, "what it is that
      has gone wrong."
    
    
      Diana sighed, then a tear coursed slowly down her cheek. Norbert was in
      the deepest despair at these signs of grief.
    
    
      "Great heavens!" cried he. "Will you not trust me? Am not I your truest
      and most devoted friend?"
    
    
      At first she refused to answer him, but at length she yielded to his
      entreaties, and confessed that the evening before her father had informed
      her that a young man had sought her hand in marriage, and one who was a
      perfectly eligible suitor.
    
    
      Norbert listened to this avowal, trembling from head to foot, with a
      sudden access of jealousy.
    
    
      "And did you make no objections?" asked he.
    
    
      "How could I?" retorted she. "What can a girl do in opposition to the will
      of all her family, when she has to choose between the alternative that she
      loathes, or a life-long seclusion in a convent?"
    
    
      Daumon shook with laughter, as he kept his ear closely to the keyhole.
    
    
      "Good business," muttered he. "Not so bad. Here's a little girl from a
      convent. She has a clever brain and a glib tongue, and under my tuition
      would be a perfect wonder. If this country booby does not make an open
      declaration at once, I wonder what her next move will be?"
    
    
      "And you hesitated," said Norbert reproachfully. "Remember you may escape
      from the walls of the convent, but not from the bonds of an ill-assorted
      marriage."
    
    
      Diana, who looked more beautiful than ever in her despair, wrung her
      hands.
    
    
      "What reason can I give to my father for declining this offer?" said she.
      "Every one knows that I am almost portionless, and that I am sacrificed to
      my brother, immolated upon the altar erected before the cruel idol of
      family pride; and how dare I refuse a suitable offer when one is made for
      my hand?"
    
    
      "Have you forgotten me?" cried Norbert. "Have you no love for me?
    
    
      "Ah, my poor friend, you are no more free than I am."
    
    
      "Then you look on me as a mere weak boy?" asked he, biting his lips.
    
    
      "Your father is very powerful," answered she in tones of the deepest
      resignation; "his determination is inflexible, and his will inexorable.
      You are completely in his power."
    
    
      "What do I care for my father?" cried the young man fiercely. "Am not I a
      Champdoce too? Woe be to any one, father or stranger, who comes between me
      and the woman I love devotedly; for I do love you, Diana, and no mortal
      man shall take you from me."
    
    
      He clasped Diana to his breast, and pressed a loving kiss upon her lips.
    
    
      "Aha," muttered Daumon, who had lost nothing from his post of espial,
      "this is worth fifty thousand francs at least to me."
    
    
      For a moment Diana remained clasped in her lover's embrace, and then, with
      a faint cry, released herself from him. She then felt that she loved him,
      and his kiss and caresses sent a thrill like liquid fire through her
      veins. She was half pleased and half terrified. She feared him, but she
      feared herself more.
    
    
      "What, Diana! Would you refuse me?" asked he, after a moment's pause. "Do
      you refuse me, when I implore you to be my wife, and to share my name with
      me? Will you not be the Duchess of Champdoce?"
    
    
      Diana only replied with a glance; but if her eyes spoke plainly, that look
      said "Yes."
    
    
      "Why, then," returned Norbert, "should we alarm ourselves with empty
      phantoms? Do you not trust me? My father may certainly oppose my plans,
      but before long I shall escape from his tyrannical sway, for I shall be of
      age."
    
    
      "Ah, Norbert," returned she sadly, "you are feeding upon vain hopes. You
      must be twenty-five years of age before you can marry and give the shelter
      of your name to the woman whom you have chosen for your wife."
    
    
      This was exactly the explanation for which Daumon had been waiting.
    
    
      "Good again, my young lady," cried he. "And so this is why she came here.
      There is some credit in giving a lesson to so apt a pupil."
    
    
      "It is impossible," cried Norbert, violently agitated; "such an iniquitous
      thing cannot be."
    
    
      "You are mistaken," answered Diana calmly. "Unfortunately I am telling you
      exactly how matters stand. The law clearly fixes the age at twenty-five.
      During all this time will you remember that a broken-hearted girl       "
    
    
      "Why talk to me of law? When I am of age, I shall have plenty of money,"
      broke in Norbert; "and do you think that I will tamely submit to my
      father's oppression? No, I will wrest his consent from him."
    
    
      During this conversation the Counsellor was carefully removing the dust
      from the knees of his trousers.
    
    
      "I will pop in suddenly," thought he, "and catch a word or two which will
      do away with the necessity of all lengthy explanations."
    
    
      He suited the action to the word, and appeared suddenly before the lovers.
      He was not at all disconcerted at the effect his entrance produced upon
      them, and remarked placidly, "I could not find the sheriff's letter, but I
      assure you that Widow Rouleau's matter shall be speedily and
      satisfactorily arranged."
    
    
      Diana and Norbert exchanged glances of annoyance at finding their secret
      at the mercy of such a man. This evident distrust appeared to wound Daumon
      deeply.
    
    
      "You have a perfect right," remarked he dejectedly, "to say, 'Mind your
      own business;' but the fact is, that I hate all kinds of injustice so much
      that I always take the side of the weakest, and so, when I come in and
      find you deploring your troubles, I say to myself, 'Doubtless here are two
      young people made for each other.'"
    
    
      "You forget yourself," broke in Diana haughtily.
    
    
      "I beg your pardon," stammered Daumon. "I am but a poor peasant, and
      sometimes I speak out too plainly. I meant no harm, and I only hope that
      you will forgive me."
    
    
      Daumon looked at Diana; and as she made no reply, he went on: "'Well,'
      says I to myself, 'here are two young folks that have fallen in love, and
      have every right to do so, and yet they are kept apart by unreasonable and
      cruel-minded parents. They are young and know nothing of the law, and
      without help they would most certainly get into a muddle. Now, suppose I
      take their matter in hand, knowing the law thoroughly as I do, and being
      up to its weak as well as its strong points.'"
    
    
      He spoke on in this strain for some minutes, and did not notice that they
      had withdrawn a little apart, and were whispering to each other.
    
    
      "Why should we not trust him?" asked Norbert. "He has plenty of
      experience."
    
    
      "He would betray us; he would do anything for money."
    
    
      "That is all the better for us then; for if we promise him a handsome sum,
      he will not say a word of what has passed to-day."
    
    
      "Do as you think best, Norbert."
    
    
      Having thus gained Diana's assent, the young man turned to Daumon. "I put
      every faith in you, and so does Mademoiselle de Laurebourg. You know our
      exact situation. What do you advise?"
    
    
      "Wait and hope," answered the Counsellor. "The slightest step taken before
      you are of age will be fatal to your prospects, but the day you are
      twenty-one I will undertake to show you several methods of bringing the
      Duke on his knees."
    
    
      Nothing could make this speech more explicit; but he was so cheerful and
      confident, that when Diana left the office, she felt a fountain of fresh
      hope well up in her heart.
    
    
      This was nearly their last interview that year, for the winter came on
      rapidly and with increased severity, so that it was impossible for the
      lovers to meet out of doors, and the fear of spying eyes prevented them
      from taking advantage of Daumon's hospitality. Each day, however, the
      widow's daughter, Francoise, carried a letter to Laurebourg, and brought
      back a reply to Champdoce. The inhabitants of the various country houses
      had fled to more genial climates, and only the Marquis de Laurebourg, who
      was an inveterate sportsman, still lingered; but at the first heavy fall
      of snow he too determined to take refuge in the magnificent house that he
      owned in the town of Poitiers. Norbert had foreseen this, and had taken
      his measures accordingly. Two or three times in the week he mounted his
      horse and rode to the town. After changing his dress, he made haste to a
      certain garden wall in which there was a small door. At an agreed hour
      this door would gently open, and as Norbert slipped through he would find
      Diana ready to welcome him, looking more bewitching than ever. This great
      passion, which now enthralled his whole life, and the certainty that his
      love was returned, had done away with a great deal of his bashfulness and
      timidity. He had resumed his acquaintanceship with Montlouis, and had
      often been with him to the Café Castille. Montlouis was only for a short
      time at Poitiers, for as soon as spring began he was to join the young
      Count de Mussidan, who had promised to find some employment for him. The
      approaching departure was not at all to Montlouis' taste, as he was madly
      in love with a young girl who resided in the town. He told all to Norbert;
      and as confidence begets confidence, he more than once accompanied the
      young Marquis to the door in the garden wall of the Count de Laurebourg's
      town house.
    
    
      April came at last. The gentry returned to their country houses, and in
      time the happy day arrived when Diana de Laurebourg was to return to her
      father's country mansion. The lovers had now every opportunity to meet,
      and would exhort each other to have patience, and a week after Diana's
      return they spent a long day together in the woods. After this delicious
      day, Norbert, happy and light-hearted, returned to his father's house.
    
    
      "Marquis," said the Duke, plunging at once into the topic nearest his
      heart, "I have found a wife for you, and in two months you will marry
      her."
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER VII.
    
    
      AN UNLUCKY BLOW.
    
    
      The falling of a thunderbolt at his feet would have startled Norbert less
      than these words did. The Duke took, or affected to take, no notice of his
      son's extreme agitation, and in a careless manner he continued,       
    
    
      "I suppose, my son, that it is hardly necessary for me to tell you the
      young lady's name. Mademoiselle Marie de Puymandour cannot fail to please
      you. She is excessively pretty, tall, dark, and with a fine figure. You
      saw her at Mass one day. What do you think of her?"
    
    
      "Think!" stammered Norbert. "Really I              "
    
    
      "Pshaw," replied the old gentleman; "I thought that you had begun to use
      your eyes. And look here, Marquis, you must adopt a different style of
      dress. You can go over with me to Poitiers to-morrow, and one of the
      tailors there will make you some clothes suitable to your rank, for I
      don't suppose that you wish to alarm your future wife by the uncouthness
      of your appearance."
    
    
      "But, father       "
    
    
      "Wait a moment, if you please. I shall have a suite of apartments reserved
      for you and your bride, and you can pass your honeymoon here. Take care
      you do not prolong it for too lengthened a period; and when it is all
      over, we can break the young woman into all our ways."
    
    
      "But," interrupted Norbert hastily, "suppose I do not fancy this young
      lady?"
    
    
      "Well, what then?"
    
    
      "Suppose I should beg you to save me from a marriage which will render me
      most unhappy?"
    
    
      The Duke shrugged his shoulders. "Why this is mere childishness," said he.
      "The marriage is a most suitable one, and it is my desire that it should
      take place."
    
    
      "But, father," again commenced Norbert.
    
    
      "What! Are you opposing my will?" asked his father angrily. "Pray, do you
      hesitate?"
    
    
      "No," answered his son coldly, "I do not hesitate."
    
    
      "Very good, then. A man of no position can consult the dictates of his
      heart when he takes a wife, but with a nobleman of rank and station it is
      certainly a different matter, for with the latter, marriage should be
      looked upon as a mere business transaction. I have made excellent
      arrangements. Let me repeat to you the conditions. The Count will give
      two-thirds of his fortune, which is estimated at five millions       just
      think of that!       and when we get that, we shall be able to screw and
      save with better heart. Think of the restoration of our house, and the
      colossal fortune that our descendants will one day inherit, and realize
      all the beauties of a life of self-denial."
    
    
      While the Duke was uttering this string of incoherent sentences, he was
      pacing up and down the room, and now he halted immediately in front of his
      son. "You understand," said he; "to-morrow you will go to Poitiers, and on
      Sunday we will dine at the house of your future father-in-law."
    
    
      In this fearful crisis Norbert did not know what to say or how to act.
    
    
      "Father," he once more commenced, "I have no wish to go to Poitiers
      to-morrow."
    
    
      "What are you saying? What in heaven's name do you mean?"
    
    
      "I mean that as I shall never love Mademoiselle de Puymandour, she will
      never be my wife."
    
    
      The Duke had never foreseen the chance of rebellion on the part of his
      son, and he could not bring his mind to receive such an unlooked-for
      event.
    
    
      "You are mad," said he at last, "and do not know what you are saying."
    
    
      "I know very well."
    
    
      "Think of what you are doing."
    
    
      "I have reflected."
    
    
      The Duke was making a violent effort to compose his ordinarily violent
      temper.
    
    
      "Do you imagine," answered he disdainfully, "that I shall be satisfied
      with an answer of this kind? I hope that you will submit to my wishes, for
      I think that, as the head of the family, I have conceived a splendid plan
      for its future aggrandizement; and do you think that, for the mere whim of
      a boy, I will be turned aside from my fixed determination?"
    
    
      "No, father," answered Norbert, "it is no boyish whim that makes me oppose
      your wishes. Tell me, have I not ever been a dutiful son to you? Have I
      ever refused to do what I was ordered? No; I have obeyed you implicitly. I
      am the son of the wealthiest man in Poitiers, and I have lived like a
      laborer's child. Whatever your mandates were, I have never complained or
      murmured at them."
    
    
      "Well, and now I order you to marry Mademoiselle de Puymandour."
    
    
      "Anything but that; I do not love her, and I shall never do so. Do you
      wish my whole life to be blighted? I entreat you to spare me this
      sacrifice!"
    
    
      "My orders are given, and you must comply with them."
    
    
      "No," answered Norbert quietly, "I will not comply with them."
    
    
      A purple flush passed across the Duke's face, then it faded away, leaving
      every feature of a livid whiteness.
    
    
      "Great heavens!" said he in a voice before which Norbert, at one time,
      would have quailed. "Whence comes the audacity that makes you venture to
      dispute my orders?"
    
    
      "From the feeling that I am acting rightly."
    
    
      "How long is it that it has been right for children to disobey their
      parents' commands?"
    
    
      "Ever since parents began to issue unjust commands."
    
    
      This speech put the finishing stroke to the Duke's rage. He made a step
      across the room, towards his son, raising the stick that he usually
      carried high in the air. For a moment he stood thus, and then, casting it
      aside, he exclaimed,       
    
    
      "No, I cannot strike a Champdoce."
    
    
      Perhaps it was Norbert's intrepid attitude that restrained the Duke's
      frenzy, for he had not moved a muscle, but stood still, with his arms
      folded, and his head thrown haughtily back.
    
    
      "No, this is an act of disobedience that I will not put up with,"
      exclaimed the old man in a voice of thunder, and, springing upon his son,
      he grasped him by the collar and dragged him up to a room on the second
      floor, and thrust him violently through the doorway.
    
    
      "You have twenty-four hours in which to reflect whether you will be
      willing to accept the wife that I have chosen for you," said he.
    
    
      "I have already decided on that point," answered Norbert quietly.
    
    
      The Duke made no reply, but slammed the door, which was of massive oak,
      and secured by a lock of enormous proportions.
    
    
      Norbert gazed round; the only other exit from the room was by means of a
      window some forty feet from the ground. The young man, however, imagined
      that some one would surely come to make up his bed for the night; that
      would give him two sheets; these he could knot together and thus secure a
      means of escape. He might not be able to see Diana at once, but he could
      easily send her a message by Daumon, warning her of what had taken place.
      Having arranged his plans, he threw himself into an armchair with a more
      easy mind than he had experienced for many months past. The decisive step
      had been taken, and the relations between his father and himself clearly
      defined, and thus he naturally considered great progress had been made,
      and the task before him seemed as nothing to what he had already
      performed.
    
    
      "My father," thought he, "must be half mad with passion."
    
    
      And Norbert was not wrong in his opinion. When the Duke, as usual, took
      his place at the table, at which the farm laborers ate their meals, not
      one of them had the courage to make a single observation. Every one knew
      what a serious altercation had taken place between father and son, and
      each one was devoured by the pangs of ungratified curiosity.
    
    
      As soon as the meal was concluded, the Duke called an old and trustworthy
      servant, who had been in his employment for over thirty years.
    
    
      "Jean," said he, "your young master is locked in the yellow room. Here is
      the key. Take him something to eat."
    
    
      "Very good, your Grace."
    
    
      "Wait a little. You will spend the night in his room and keep a strict
      watch upon him. He may design to make his escape. If he attempts it,
      restrain him, if necessary, by physical force. Should he prove too strong
      for you, call to me; I shall be near, and will come to your aid."
    
    
      This unexpected precaution upon the Duke's part upset all Norbert's plans
      of escape. He endeavored to persuade Jean to allow him to go out for a
      couple of hours, giving his word of honor that he would return at the
      expiration of that time. Prayers and menaces, however, had no effect. Had
      the young man gazed from the window, he would have seen his father
      striding moodily up and down the courtyard, with the thought gnawing at
      his heart that perhaps after all these many years of waiting his plans
      might yet be frustrated.
    
    
      "There is a woman at the bottom of all this," said he to himself. "It is
      only woman's wiles that in this brief space of time would effect so
      complete a change in a young man's disposition. Besides, he would not have
      so obstinately declined to listen to the proposal I made him had not his
      affections been engaged elsewhere. Who can she be? and by what means shall
      I find her out?"
    
    
      It would be absurd to question Norbert, and the Duke was excessively
      unwilling to institute any regular inquiry into the matter. He passed the
      whole night in gloomy indecision, but towards morning an inspiration came
      to him which he looked upon as a special interposition of Providence.
    
    
      "Bruno," he exclaimed with a mighty oath. "The dog will show me the place
      that his master frequents and perhaps lead me to the very woman who had
      bewitched him."
    
    
      The brilliant idea soothed him a great deal, and at one o'clock he took
      his seat as usual at the head of the table, and ordered food to be taken
      up to Norbert, but that none of the measures for his safe custody were to
      be relaxed.
    
    
      When he thought the moment was a favorable one, he whistled to Bruno, and,
      though the dog rarely followed him, yet in the absence of his master, he
      condescended to accompany the Duke down the avenue to the front gates.
      Three roads branched off from here, but the dog did not hesitate for a
      moment, and took the one to the left, like an animal who knew his
      destination perfectly well. Bruno went ahead for nearly half an hour,
      until he reached the exact spot where Diana had met with her accident. He
      made a cast round, but finding nothing, sat down, clearly saying,       
    
    
      "Let us wait."
    
    
      "This, then," muttered the Duke, "is the place where the lovers have been
      in the habit of meeting each other."
    
    
      The place was a very lonely one, and, standing on the rising ground,
      commanded a view of the country for a long way round.
    
    
      The Duke noticed this, and took up a position where the trunk of a giant
      oak almost concealed him from observation. He was delighted at his
      sagacity, and was almost in a good humor; for now that he had reflected,
      the danger did not seem by any means so great, for to whom could Norbert
      have lost his heart? To some little peasant girl, perhaps, who, thinking
      that the lad was an easy dupe, had tried to induce him to marry her. As
      these thoughts passed through the Duke's brain, Bruno gave a joyous bark.
    
    
      "Here she is,' muttered he, as he emerged from his hiding place, and at
      that moment Diana de Laurebourg made her appearance; but as soon as she
      saw the Duke she uttered a faint cry of alarm. She was inclined to turn
      and fly, but her strength failed her, and, extending her hands, she
      grasped the boughs of a slender birch tree that grew close by, to prevent
      herself from falling. The Duke was quite as much astonished as the young
      lady. He had expected to see a peasant girl, and here was the daughter of
      the Marquis de Laurebourg. But anger soon succeeded to surprise; for
      though he might have had nothing to fear from the peasant, the daughter of
      the Marquis de Laurebourg was an utterly different antagonist. He could
      not rely upon aid from her family, as, for all he knew, they might be
      aiding and abetting her.
    
    
      "Well, my child," began he, "you do not seem very glad to see me."
    
    
      "Your Grace."
    
    
      "Yes, when you come out to meet the son, it is annoying to meet the
      father; but do not blame poor Norbert, for I assure you he is not in
      fault."
    
    
      Though Mademoiselle de Laurebourg had been startled at first, she was
      possessed of too strong a will to give in, and soon recovered her
      self-possession.
    
    
      She never thought to screen herself by a denial of her reasons for being
      on the spot, for such a course she would have looked on as an act of
      treacherous cowardice.
    
    
      "You are quite right," answered she. "I came here to meet your son, and
      therefore you will pardon me if I take my leave of you."
    
    
      With a deep courtesy she was about to move away, when the Duke laid a
      restraining grip upon her arm.
    
    
      "Permit me, my child," said he, endeavoring to put on a kind and paternal
      tone,       "let me say a few words to you. Do you know why Norbert did
      not come to meet you?"
    
    
      "He has doubtless some very good reason."
    
    
      "My son is locked up in a room, and my servants have my orders to prevent
      his making his escape by force, if necessary."
    
    
      "Poor fellow! He deserves the deepest commiseration."
    
    
      The Duke was much surprised at this piece of impertinence, as he
      considered it.
    
    
      "I will tell you," returned he in tones of rising anger, "how it comes
      that I treat my son, the heir to my rank and fortune, in this manner."
    
    
      He looked savagely angry as he spoke, but Diana answered negligently,
      "Pray go on; you quite interest me."
    
    
      "Well then, listen to me. I have chosen a wife for Norbert; she is as
      young as you are       beautiful, clever, and wealthy."
    
    
      "And of noble birth, of course."
    
    
      The sarcasm conveyed in this reply roused the Duke to fury.
    
    
      "Fifteen hundred thousand francs as a marriage portion will outweigh a
      coat of arms, even though it should be a tower argent on a field azure."
      The Duke paused as he made this allusion to the Laurebourg arms, and then
      continued, "In addition to this, she has great expectations; and yet my
      son is mad enough to refuse the hand of this wealthy heiress."
    
    
      "If you think that this marriage will cause your son's happiness, you are
      quite right in acting as you have done."
    
    
      "Happiness! What has that to do with the matter, as long as it adds to the
      aggrandizement of our house and name? I have made up my mind that Norbert
      shall marry this girl; I have sworn it, and I never break my oath. I told
      him this myself."
    
    
      Diana suffered acutely, but her pride supported her, whilst her confidence
      in Norbert was so great that she had the boldness to inquire, "And what
      did he say to that?"
    
    
      "Norbert will become a dutiful son once more when he is removed from the
      malignant influence which has been so injurious to him," returned the Duke
      fiercely.
    
    
      "Indeed."
    
    
      "He will obey me, when I show him that though he may not value his name
      and position, there are others who do so; and that many a woman would
      fight a brave battle for the honor of being the Duchess of Champdoce.
      Young lady, my son is a mere boy; but I have known the world, and when I
      prove to the poor fool that it was only grasping ambition which assumed
      the garb of love, he will renounce his folly and resume his allegiance to
      me. I will tell him what I think of the poverty-stricken adventuresses of
      high birth, whose only weapons are their youth and beauty, and with which
      they think that they can win a wealthy husband in the battle of life."
    
    
      "Continue, sir," broke in Diana haughtily. "Insult a defenceless girl with
      her poverty! It is a noble act, and one worthy of a high-born gentleman
      like yourself!"
    
    
      "I believed," said the Duke, "that I was addressing the woman whose advice
      had led my son to break into open rebellion against my authority. Am I
      right or wrong? You can prove me to be mistaken by urging upon Norbert the
      necessity for submission."
    
    
      She made no reply, but bent her head upon her bosom.
    
    
      "You see," continued the Duke, "that I am correct, and that if you
      continue to act as you have done, I shall be justified in retaliating in
      any manner that I may deem fit. You have now been warned. Carry on this
      intrigue at your peril."
    
    
      He placed such an insulting emphasis upon the word "intrigue" that Diana's
      anger rose to boiling point. At that instant, for the sake of vengeance,
      she would have risked her honor, her ambition, her very life itself.
    
    
      Forgetting all prudence, she cast aside her mask of affected indifference,
      and, with her eyes flashing angry gleams of fire, and her cheeks burning,
      she said,       
    
    
      "Listen to me. I, too, have sworn an oath, and it is that Norbert shall be
      my husband; and I tell you that he shall be so! Shut him up in prison,
      subject him to every indignity at the hands of your menials, but you will
      never break his spirit, or make him go back from his plighted word. If I
      bid him, he will resist your will even unto the bitter end. He and I will
      never yield. Believe me when I tell you, that before you attack a young
      girl's honor, you had better pause; for one day she will be a member of
      your family. Farewell."
    
    
      Before the Duke could recover his senses, Diana was far down the path on
      her way homewards; and then he burst into a wild storm of menaces, oaths,
      and insults. He fancied that he was alone, but he was mistaken; for the
      whole of that strange scene had a hidden witness, and that witness was
      Daumon. He had heard of the treatment of the young Marquis from one of his
      servants at the Chateau, and his first thought had been to acquaint Diana
      with it. Unfortunately he saw no means of doing this. He dared not go to
      Laurebourg, and he would have died sooner than put pen to paper. He was in
      a position of the deepest embarrassment when the idea struck him of going
      to the lovers' trysting place. The little cry that Diana had uttered upon
      perceiving the Duke had put him upon his guard. Bruno had found him out;
      but, as he knew him, merely fawned upon him. He was delighted at the fury
      of the Duke, whom he hated with cold and steady malignity; but the courage
      of Diana filled him with admiration. Her sublime audacity won his warmest
      praises, and he longed for her as an ally to aid him in his scheme of
      revenge. He knew that the girl would find herself in a terribly
      embarrassing position, and thus she would be sure to call upon him for
      advice before returning home.
    
    
      "Now," thought he, "if I wish to profit by her anger, I ought to strike
      while the iron is hot; and to do so, I should be at home to meet her."
    
    
      Without a moment's delay, he dashed through the woods, striving to get
      home without the young girl's perceiving him. His movements in the
      underwood caught the Duke's eye.
    
    
      "Who is there?" exclaimed he, moving towards the spot from whence the
      rustling came. There was no reply. Surely he had not been mistaken.
      Calling to Bruno, he strove to put him on the scent, but the dog showed no
      signs of eagerness. He sniffed about for a time, and seemed to linger near
      one special spot. The Duke moved towards it, and distinctly saw the
      impression of two knees upon the grass.
    
    
      "Some one has been eavesdropping," muttered he, much enraged at his
      discovery. "Who can it be? Has Norbert escaped from his prison?"
    
    
      As he returned through the courtyard, he called one of the grooms to him.
    
    
      "Where is my son?" asked he.
    
    
      "Upstairs, your Grace," was the answer.
    
    
      The Duke breathed more freely. Norbert was still in security, and
      therefore could not have been the person who had been listening.
    
    
      "But," added the lad, "the young master is half frantic."
    
    
      "What do you mean?"
    
    
      "Well, he declared that he would not remain in his room an instant longer;
      so old Jean called for help. He is awfully strong, and it took six of us
      to hold him. He said that if we would let him go, he would return in two
      hours, and that his honor and life were involved."
    
    
      The Duke listened with a sarcastic smile. He cared nothing about the
      frantic struggles of his son, for his heart had grown cold and hard from
      the presence of the fixed idea which had actuated his conduct for so many
      years, and it was with the solemn face of a man who was fulfilling a
      sacred duty that he ascended to the room in which his son was imprisoned.
      Jean threw open the door, and the Duke paused for a moment on the
      threshold. The furniture had been overturned, some of it broken, and there
      were evident signs of a furious struggle having taken place.
    
    
      A powerful laborer stood near the window, and Norbert was lying on the
      bed, with his face turned to the wall.
    
    
      "Leave us," said the Duke, and the man withdrew at once.
    
    
      "Get up, Norbert," he added; "I wish to speak to you."
    
    
      His son obeyed him. Any one but the Duke would have been alarmed by the
      expression of the young man's face.
    
    
      "What is the meaning of all this?" asked the old nobleman in his most
      severe voice. "Are not my orders sufficient to insure obedience? I hear
      that absolute force has had to be used towards you during my absence. Tell
      me, my son, what plans you have devised during these hours of solitude,
      and what hopes you still venture to cherish."
    
    
      "I intend to be free, and I will be so."
    
    
      The Duke affected not to hear the reply, uttered as it was in a tone of
      derision.
    
    
      "It was very easy for me to discover, from your obstinacy, that some woman
      had endeavored to entrap you, and by her insidious counsels inducing you
      to disobey your best friend."
    
    
      He paused, but there was no reply.
    
    
      "This woman       this dangerous woman       I have been in search of, and
      as you can conceive, I easily found her. I went to the Forest of Bevron,
      and there I need not tell you I found Mademoiselle de Laurebourg."
    
    
      "Did you speak to her?"
    
    
      "I did so, certainly. I told her my opinion of those manoeuvring women who
      fascinate the dupes they intend to take advantage of       "
    
    
      "Father!"
    
    
      "Can it be possible that you, simple boy even as you are, could have been
      deceived by the pretended love of this wily young woman? It is not you,
      Marquis, that she loves, but our name and fortune; but I know if she
      does not that the law will imprison women who contrive to entrap young men
      who are under age."
    
    
      Norbert turned deadly pale.
    
    
      "Did you really say that to her?" asked he, in a low, hoarse voice,
      utterly unlike his own. "You dare to insult the woman I love, when you
      knew that I was far away and unable to protect her! Take care, or I shall
      forget that you are my father."
    
    
      "He actually threatens me," said the Duke, "my son threatens me;" and,
      raising the heavy stick he held in his hand, he struck Norbert a violent
      blow. By a fortunate movement the unhappy boy drew back, and so avoided
      the full force of the stroke, but the end of the stick struck him across
      the temple, inflicting a long though not a serious wound. In his blind
      rage Norbert was about to throw himself upon his father, when his eyes
      caught sight of the open door. Liberty and safety lay before him, and,
      with a bound, he was on the stairs, and before the Duke could shout for
      aid from the window, his son was tearing across the park with all the
      appearance and gesture of a madman.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER VIII.
    
    
      THE LITTLE GLASS BOTTLE.
    
    
      In order to avoid being seen by Mademoiselle de Laurebourg, Daumon had to
      take a much longer route to regain his home than the one that Diana had
      followed. This, however, he could not help. As soon as he arrived at his
      home he ran hastily upstairs and took from a cleverly concealed
      hiding-place in the wainscoting of his bedroom a small bottle of dark
      green glass, which he hastily slipped into his pocket. When he had once
      more descended to his office, he again took it out and examined it
      carefully to see that it had in no way been tampered with; then, with a
      hard, cruel smile, he placed it upon his desk among his ledgers and
      account books. Diana de Laurebourg might pay him a visit as soon as she
      liked, for he was quite prepared for her, for he had slipped on his
      dressing-gown and placed his velvet skull cap upon his head, as if he had
      not quitted the house that day.
    
    
      "Why on earth does she not come?" muttered he.
    
    
      He began to be uneasy. He went to the window and glanced eagerly down the
      road; then he drew out his watch and examined the face of it, when all at
      once his ears detected a gentle tapping at the door of the office.
    
    
      "Come in," said he.
    
    
      The door opened, and Diana entered slowly, without uttering a word, and
      took no notice of the servile obsequiousness of the Counsellor; indeed,
      she hardly seemed to notice his presence, and with a deep sigh she threw
      herself into a chair.
    
    
      In his inmost heart Daumon was filled with the utmost delight; he now
      understood why Diana had taken so long in reaching his house; it was
      because her interview with the Duke had almost overcome her.
    
    
      She soon, however, recovered her energy, and shook off the languor that
      seemed to cling to her limbs, and turning towards her host, said abruptly,       
    
    
      "Counsellor, I have come to you for advice, which I sorely need. About an
      hour ago       "
    
    
      With a gesture of sympathy Daumon interrupted her,       
    
    
      "Alas!" said he; "spare me the recital, I know all."
    
    
      "You know              "
    
    
      "Yes, I know that M. Norbert is a prisoner at the Chateau. Yes,
      mademoiselle, I know this, and I know, too, that you have just met the
      Duke de Champdoce in the Forest of Bevron. I know, moreover, all that you
      said to the old nobleman, for I have heard every word from a person who
      has just left."
    
    
      In spite of her strong nerves, Diana was unable to restrain a movement of
      dismay and terror.
    
    
      "But who told you of this?" murmured she.
    
    
      "A man who was out cutting wood. Ah! my dear young lady, the forest is not
      a safe place to tell secrets in, for you never know whether watchful eyes
      and listening ears are not concealed behind every tree. This man, and I am
      afraid some of his companions, heard every word that was spoken, and as
      soon as you left the Duke the man scampered off to tell the story. I made
      him promise not to say a word, but he is a married man and is sure to tell
      it to his wife. Then there are his companions; dear me! it is most
      annoying."
    
    
      "Then all is lost, and I am ruined," murmured she.
    
    
      But her despair did not last long, for she was by no means the woman to
      throw down her arms and sue for mercy. She grasped the arm of the
      Counsellor.
    
    
      "The end has not come yet, surely? Speak! What is to be done? You must
      have some plan. I am ready for anything, now that I have nothing to lose.
      No one shall ever say that that cowardly villain, the Duke de Champdoce,
      insulted me with impunity. Tell me, will you help me?"
    
    
      "In the name of heaven!" cried he, "do not speak so loud. You do not know
      the adversary that you have to contend with."
    
    
      "Are you afraid of him?"
    
    
      "Yes, I do fear him; and what is more, I fear him very much. He is a
      determined man, and will gain his object at any cost or risk. Do you know
      that he did his best to crush me because I summoned him to court on behalf
      of one of my clients? So that now, when any one comes to me and wishes to
      proceed against the Duke, I am glad to decline to take up the matter."
    
    
      "And so," returned the young girl in a tone of cold contempt, "after
      leading us to this compromising position, you are ready to abandon us at
      the most critical moment?"
    
    
      "Can you think such a thing, mademoiselle?"
    
    
      "You can act as you please, Counsellor; Norbert is still left to me; he
      will protect me."
    
    
      Daumon shook his head with an air of deep sorrow.
    
    
      "How can we be sure that at this very moment the Marquis has not given in
      to all his father's wishes?"
    
    
      "No," exclaimed the girl; "such a supposition is an insult to Norbert. He
      would sooner die than give in. He may be timid, but he is not a coward;
      the thoughts of me will give him the power to resist his father's
      tyranny."
    
    
      Daumon allowed himself to fall into his great armchair as though overcome
      by the excitement of this interview.
    
    
      "We can talk coolly enough here and with no one to threaten us; but the
      Marquis, on the other hand, is exposed to all his father's violence and
      ill treatment, moral as well as physical, without any defence for aid from
      a soul in the world, and in such times as these the strongest will may
      give way."
    
    
      "Yes, I see it all; Norbert may give in, he may marry another woman, and I
      shall be left alone, with my reputation gone, and the scorn and scoff of
      all the neighborhood."
    
    
      "But, mademoiselle, you still have       "
    
    
      "All I have left is life, and that life I would gladly give for
      vengeance."
    
    
      There was something so terribly determined in the young girl's voice that
      again Daumon started, and this time his start was sincere and not
      simulated.
    
    
      "Yes, you are right," said he, "and there are many besides myself who have
      vowed to have revenge on the Duke, and their time will come, have no fear.
      A quiet shot in the woods in the dusk of the evening would settle many a
      long account. It has been tried, but the old man seems to have the luck of
      the evil one; and if the gun did not miss fire, the bullets flew wide of
      the mark. A judge might take a very serious view of such a matter, and
      term a crime what was merely an act of justice. Who can say whether the
      death of the Duke de Champdoce might not save him from the commission of
      many acts of tyranny and oppression and render many deserving persons
      happy?"
    
    
      The face of Diana de Laurebourg turned deadly pale as she listened to
      these specious arguments.
    
    
      "As things go," continued Daumon, "the Duke may go on living to a hundred;
      he is wealthy and influential, and to a certain degree looked up to. He
      will die peacefully in his bed, there will be a magnificent funeral, and
      masses will be sung for the repose of his soul."
    
    
      While he spoke the Counsellor had taken the little bottle from beside his
      account books and was turning it over and over between his fingers.
    
    
      "Yes," murmured he, thoughtfully; "the Duke is quite likely to outlive us
      all, unless, indeed              "
    
    
      He took the cork from the bottle, and poured a little of the contents into
      the palm of his hand. A few grains of fine white powder, glittering like
      crystal, appeared on the brown skin of the Counsellor.
    
    
      "And yet," he went on, in cold, sinister accents, "let him take but a
      small pinch of this, and no one need fear his tyranny again in this world.
      No one is much afraid of a man who lies some six feet under ground, shut
      up in a strong oak coffin, with a finely carved gravestone over his head."
    
    
      He stopped short, and fixed his keen eyes upon the agitated girl, who
      stood in front of him. For at least two minutes the man and the girl stood
      face to face, motionless, and without exchanging a word. Through the dead,
      weird silence, the pulsations of their hearts were plainly audible. It
      seemed as if before speaking again each wished to fathom the depths of
      guilt that lay in the other's heart. It was a compact entered into by look
      and not by speech; and Daumon so well understood this, that at length,
      when he did speak, his voice sank to a hoarse whisper, as though he
      himself feared to listen to the utterance of his own thoughts.
    
    
      "A man taking this feels no pain. It is like a heavy, stunning blow on the
      forehead       in ten seconds all is over, no gasp, no cry, but the heart
      ceases to beat forever; and, best of all, it leaves no trace behind it. A
      little of this, such a little, in wine or coffee, would be enough. It is
      tasteless, colorless, and scentless, its presence is impossible to be
      detected."
    
    
      "But in the event of a post-mortem examination?"
    
    
      "By skilful analysts in Paris or the larger towns, there would be a
      chance; but in a place like this, never! Never, in fact, anywhere, unless
      there had been previous grounds for suspicion. Otherwise only apoplectic
      symptoms would be observed; and even if it was traced there comes the
      question, By whom was it administered?"
    
    
      He stopped short, for a word rose to his lips which he did not dare utter;
      he raised his hands to his mouth, coughed slightly, and went on,       
    
    
      "This substance is not sold by chemists; it is very rarely met with,
      difficult to prepare, and terribly expensive. The smallest quantity might
      be met with in the first-class laboratories for scientific purposes, but
      it is most unlikely for any one in these parts to possess any of this
      drug, or even to know of its existence."
    
    
      "And yet you              "
    
    
      "That is quite another matter. Years ago, when I was far away from here,
      it was in my power to render a great service to a distinguished chemist,
      and he made me a present of this combination of his skill. It would be
      impossible to trace this bottle; I have had it ten years, and the man who
      gave it to me is dead. Ten years? No, I am wrong, it is now twelve."
    
    
      "And in all these years has not this substance lost any of its destructive
      powers?"
    
    
      "I tried it only a month ago. I threw a pinch of it into a basin of milk
      and gave it to a powerful mastiff. He drank the milk and in ten seconds
      fell stark and dead."
    
    
      "Horrible!" exclaimed Diana, covering her face with her hand, and
      recoiling from the tempter.
    
    
      A sinister smile quivered upon the thin lips of the Counsellor.
    
    
      "Why do you say horrible?" asked he; "the dog had shown symptoms of rabies,
      and had he bitten me, I might have expired in frightful torture. Was it
      not fair self-defence? Sometimes, however, a man is more dangerous than a
      dog. A man blights the whole of my life; I strike him down openly, and the
      law convicts me and puts me to death; but I do not contemplate doing so,
      for I would suppress such a man secretly."
    
    
      Diana placed her hands on the man's mouth and stopped a further exposition
      of his ideas.
    
    
      "Listen to me," said she. But at this moment a heavy step was heard
      outside. "It is Norbert," gasped she.
    
    
      "Impossible! It is more likely his father."
    
    
      "It is Norbert," cried Mademoiselle de Laurebourg, and snatching the
      little bottle from the Counsellor's hands, she thrust it into her bosom.
      The door flew open, and Norbert appeared on the threshold. Diana and the
      Counsellor both uttered a shriek of terror. His livid countenance seemed
      to indicate that he had passed through some terrible scene; his gait was
      unsteady, his clothes torn and disordered, and his face stained with
      blood, which had flowed from a cut over his temple. Daumon imagined that
      some outrage had taken place.
    
    
      "You have been wounded, Marquis?" said he.
    
    
      "Yes, my father struck me."
    
    
      "Can it be possible?"
    
    
      "Yes, he struck me."
    
    
      Mademoiselle Diana had feared this, and she trembled with the terror of
      her vague conjectures as she made a step towards her lover.
    
    
      "Permit me to examine your wound," said she.
    
    
      She placed both her hands at the side of his head and stood on tip-toe,
      the better to inspect the cut. As she did so, she shuddered; an inch
      lower, and the consequences might have been fatal.
    
    
      "Quick," she said, "give me some rags and water."
    
    
      Norbert gently disengaged himself. "It is a mere nothing," said he, "and
      can be looked after later on. Fortunately I did not receive the whole
      weight of the blow, which would otherwise have brought me senseless to the
      ground, and perhaps I should have been slain by my father's hand."
    
    
      "By the Duke? and for what reason did he strike you?"
    
    
      "Diana, he had grossly insulted you, and he dared to tell me of it. Had he
      forgotten that the blood of the race of Champdoce ran in my veins as well
      as in his?"
    
    
      Mademoiselle de Laurebourg burst into a passion of tears.
    
    
      "I," sobbed she, "I have brought all this upon you."
    
    
      "You? Why, it is to you that he owes his life. He dared to strike me as if
      I had been a lackey, but the thoughts of you stayed my hand. I turned and
      fled, and never again will I enter that accursed house. I renounce the
      Duke de Champdoce, he is no longer my father, and I will never look upon
      his face again. Would that I could forget that such a man existed; but,
      no, I would rather that I remembered him for the sake of revenge."
    
    
      Again the heart of Daumon overflowed with joy. All his deeply malignant
      spirit thrilled pleasantly as he heard these words.
    
    
      "Marquis," said he, "perhaps you will now believe with me that in all
      misfortunes there is an element of luck, for your father has committed an
      act of imprudence which will yet cost him dear. It is very strange that so
      astute a man as the Duke de Champdoce should have allowed his passion to
      carry him away."
    
    
      "What do you mean?"
    
    
      "Simply that you can be freed from the tyranny of your father whenever you
      like now. We now have all that is necessary for lodging a formal plaint in
      court. We have sequestration of the person, threats and bodily violence by
      the aid of third parties, and words and blows which have endangered life;
      our case is entirely complete. A surgeon will examine your wound, and give
      a written deposition. We can produce plenty of evidence, and the wound on
      the head will tell its own story. As a commencement we will petition that
      we may not be ordered back to our father's custody, and it will further be
      set forth that our reason for this is that a father has assaulted a son
      with undue and unnecessary violence. We shall be sure to gain the day, and       "
    
    
      "Enough," broke in Norbert; "will the decision give me the right to marry
      whom I please without my father's consent?"
    
    
      Daumon hesitated. Under the circumstances, it seemed to him very likely
      that the court would grant Norbert the liberty he desired; he, however,
      thought it advisable not to say so, and answered boldly, "No, Marquis, it
      will not do so."
    
    
      "Well, then, the Champdoce family have never exposed their differences to
      the public, nor will I begin to do so," said Norbert decisively.
    
    
      The Counsellor seemed surprised at this determination.
    
    
      "If, Marquis," he began, "I might venture to advise you       "
    
    
      "No advice is necessary, my mind is entirely made up, but I need some
      help, and in twenty-four hours I require a large sum of money       twenty
      thousand francs."
    
    
      "You can have them, Marquis, but I warn you that you will have to pay
      heavily for the accommodation."
    
    
      "That I care nothing for."
    
    
      Mademoiselle de Laurebourg was about to speak, but with a gesture of his
      hand Norbert arrested her.
    
    
      "Do you not comprehend me, Diana?" said he; "we must fly, and that at
      once. We can find some safe retreat where we can live happily, where no
      one will harm us."
    
    
      "But this is mere madness!" cried Diana.
    
    
      "You will be pursued," remarked the Counsellor; "and most likely
      overtaken."
    
    
      "Can you not trust your life to me?" asked Norbert reproachfully. "I swear
      that I will devote everything to you, life, thought, and will. On my knees
      I entreat you to fly with me."
    
    
      "I cannot," murmured she; "it is impossible."
    
    
      "Then you do not love me," said he in desponding accents. "I have been a
      thrice-besotted fool to believe that your heart was mine, for you can
      never have loved me."
    
    
      "Hear him, merciful powers! he says that I, who am all his, do not love
      him."
    
    
      "Then why cast aside our only chance of safety?"
    
    
      "Norbert, dearest Norbert!"
    
    
      "I understand you too well; you are alarmed at the idea of the world's
      censure, and              "
    
    
      He paused, checked by the gleam of reproach that shone in Diana's eyes.
    
    
      "Must it be so?" said she; "must I condescend to justify myself? You talk
      to me of the world's censure? Have I not already defied it, and has it not
      sat in judgment upon me? And what have I done, after all? Every act and
      word that has passed between us I can repeat to my mother without a blush
      rising to my cheek; but would any one credit my words? No, not a living
      soul. Most likely the world has come to a decision. My reputation is gone,
      is utterly lost, and yet I am spotless as the driven snow."
    
    
      Norbert was half-mad with anger.
    
    
      "Who would dare to treat you with anything save the most profound
      respect?" said he.
    
    
      "Alas! my dear Norbert," replied she, "to-morrow the scandal will be even
      greater. While your father was talking to me with such brutal violence and
      contempt, he was overheard by a woodcutter and perhaps by some of his
      companions."
    
    
      "It cannot be."
    
    
      "No, it is quite true," returned Daumon. "I had it from the man myself."
    
    
      Mademoiselle de Laurebourg shot one glance at the Counsellor; it was only
      a glance, but he comprehended at once that she wished to be left alone
      with her lover.
    
    
      "Pardon me," said he, "but I think I have a visitor, and I must hinder any
      one from coming in here."
    
    
      He left the room as he spoke, closing the door noisily behind him.
    
    
      "And so," resumed Norbert when alone, "it seems that the Duke de Champdoce
      did not even take the ordinary precaution of assuring himself that you
      were in privacy before he spoke as he did, and was so carried away by his
      fury that he never thought that in casting dishonor upon you, he was
      heaping infamy on me. Does he think by these means to compel me to marry
      the heiress whom he has chose for me, the Mademoiselle de Puymandour?"
    
    
      For the first time Diana learned the name of her rival.
    
    
      "Ah!" moaned she between her sobs, "so it is Mademoiselle de Puymandour
      that he wants you to marry?"
    
    
      "Yes, the same, or rather her enormous wealth; but may my hand wither
      before it clasps hers. Do you hear me, Diana?"
    
    
      She gave a sad smile and murmured, "Poor Norbert!"
    
    
      The heart of the young man sank; so melancholy was the tone of her voice.
    
    
      "You are very cruel," said he. "What have I done to deserve this want of
      confidence?"
    
    
      Diana made no reply, and Norbert, believing that he understood the reason
      why she refused to fly with him, said, "Is it because you have no faith in
      me, that you will not accompany me in my flight?"
    
    
      "No; I have perfect faith in you."
    
    
      "What is it, then? Do I not offer you fortune and happiness? Tell me what
      it is then."
    
    
      She drew herself up, and said proudly, "Up to this time, my conscience has
      enabled me to hold my own against all the scandalous gossip that has been
      flying about, but now it says, 'Halt, Diana de Laurebourg! You have gone
      far enough.' My burden is heavy, my heart is breaking, but I must draw
      back now. No, Norbert; I cannot fly with you."
    
    
      She paused for a moment, as though unable to proceed, and then went on
      with more firmness, "Were I alone and solitary in the world, I might act
      differently; but I have a family, whose honor I must guard as I would my
      own."
    
    
      "A family indeed, which sacrifices you to your elder brother."
    
    
      "It may be so, and therefore my task is all the greater. Who ever head of
      virtue as something easy to practise?"
    
    
      Norbert never remembered what an example of rebellion she had set.
    
    
      "My heart and my conscience dictate the same course to me. The result must
      ever be fatal, when a young girl sets at defiance the rules and laws of
      society; and you would never care to look with respect on one upon whom
      others gazed with the eye of contempt."
    
    
      "What sort of an opinion have you of me, then?"
    
    
      "I believe you to be a man, Norbert. Let us suppose that I fly with you,
      and that the next day I should hear that my father has been killed in a
      duel fought on my account; what then? Believe me, that when I tell you to
      fly by yourself, I give you the best advice in my power. You will forget
      me, I know; but what else can I hope for?"
    
    
      "Forget you!" said Norbert angrily. "Can you forget me?"
    
    
      His face was so close to hers that she felt the hot breath upon her cheek.
    
    
      "Yes," stammered she, with a violent effort, "I can."
    
    
      Norbert drew a pace back, that he might read her meaning more fully in her
      eyes.
    
    
      "And if I go away," asked he, "what will become of you?"
    
    
      A sob burst from the young girl's breast, and her strength seemed to
      desert her limbs.
    
    
      "I," answered she, in the calm, resigned voice of a Christian virgin about
      to be cast to the lions that roared in the arena, "I have my destiny.
      To-day is the last time that we shall ever meet. I shall return to my
      home, where everything will shortly be known. I shall find my father angry
      and menacing. He will place me in a carriage, and the next day I shall
      find myself within the walls of the hated convent."
    
    
      "But that life would be one long, slow agony to you. You have told me this
      before."
    
    
      "Yes," answered she, "it would be an agony, but it would also be an
      expiation; and when the burden grows too heavy, I have this."
    
    
      And as she spoke, she drew the little bottle from its hiding-place in her
      bosom, and Norbert too well understood her meaning. The young man
      endeavored to take it from her, but she resisted. This contest seemed to
      exhaust her little strength, her beautiful eyes closed, and she sank
      senseless into Norbert's arms. In an agony of despair, the young man asked
      himself if she was dying; and yet there was sufficient life in her to
      enable her to whisper, soft and low, these words, "My only friend       let
      me have it back, dear Norbert." And then, with perfect clearness, she
      repeated all the deadly properties of the drug, and the directions for its
      use that the Counsellor had given to her.
    
    
      On hearing the woman whom he loved with such intense passion confess that
      she would sooner die than live apart from him, Norbert's brain reeled.
    
    
      "Diana, my own Diana!" repeated he, as he hung over her.
    
    
      But she went on, as though speaking through the promptings of delirium.
    
    
      "The very day after such a fair prospect! Ah, Duke de Champdoce! You are a
      hard and pitiless man. You have robbed me of all I held dear in the world,
      blackened my reputation, and tarnished my honor, and now you want my
      life."
    
    
      Norbert uttered such a cry of anger, that even Daumon in the passage was
      startled by it. He placed Diana tenderly in the Counsellor's arm-chair,
      saying,       
    
    
      "No, you shall not kill yourself, nor shall you leave me."
    
    
      She smiled faintly, and held out her arms to him. Her magic spells were
      deftly woven.
    
    
      "No," cried he; "the poison which you had intended to use on yourself
      shall become my weapon of vengeance, and the instrument of punishment of
      the one who has wronged you."
    
    
      And with the gait of a man walking in his sleep, he left the Counsellor's
      office.
    
    
      Hardly had the young man's footsteps died away, than Daumon entered the
      room. He had not lost a word or action in the foregoing scene, and he was
      terribly agitated; and he could scarcely believe his eyes when he saw
      Diana, whom he had supposed to be lying half-sensible in the arm-chair,
      standing at the window, gazing after Norbert, as he walked along the road
      leading from the Counsellor's cottage.
    
    
      "Ah! what a woman!" muttered he. "Gracious powers, what a wonderful
      woman!"
    
    
      When Diana had lost sight of her lover, she turned round to Daumon. Her
      face was pale, and her eyelids swollen, but her eyes flashed with the
      conviction of success.
    
    
      "To-morrow, Counsellor," said she, "to-morrow I shall be the Duchess de
      Champdoce."
    
    
      Daumon was so overwhelmed that, accustomed as he was to startling events
      and underhand trickery, he could find no words to express his feelings.
    
    
      "That is to say," added Diana thoughtfully, "if all goes as it should
      to-night."
    
    
      Daumon felt a cold shiver creep over him, but summoning up all his
      self-possession, he said, "I do not understand you. What is this that you
      hope will be accomplished to-night?"
    
    
      She turned so contemptuous and sarcastic a look on him, that the words
      died away in his mouth, and he at once saw his mistake in thinking that he
      could sport with the girl's feelings as a cat plays with a mouse; for it
      was she who was playing with him, and she, a simple girl, had made this
      wily man of the world her dupe.
    
    
      "Success is, of course, a certainty," answered she coldly; "but Norbert is
      impetuous, and impetuous people are often awkward. But I must return home
      at once. Ah, me!" she added, as her self-control gave way for a moment,
      "will this cruel night never pass away, and give way to the gentle light
      of dawn? Farewell, Counsellor. When we meet again, all matters will be
      settled, one way or other."
    
    
      The Parthian dart which Mademoiselle de Laurebourg had cast behind her
      went true to the mark; the allusion to Norbert's impetuosity and
      awkwardness rendered the Counsellor very unhappy. He sat down in his
      arm-chair, and, resting his head on his hands, and his elbows on his desk,
      he strove to review the position thoroughly. Perhaps by now all might be
      over. Where was Norbert, and what was he doing? he asked himself.
    
    
      At the time that Daumon was reflecting, Norbert was on the road leading to
      Champdoce. He had entirely lost his head, but he found that his reason was
      clear and distinct. Those who have been accustomed to the treatment of
      maniacs know with what startling rapidity they form a chain of action, and
      the cloud that veiled Norbert's brain appeared to throw out into stronger
      relief the murderous determination he had formed. He had already decided
      how the deed was to be done. The common wine of the country was always
      served to the laborers at the table, but the Duke kept a better quality
      for his own drinking, and the bottle containing this was after meals
      placed on a shelf in a cupboard in the dining-room. It was thus within
      every one's reach, but not a soul in the household would have ventured to
      lay a finger upon it. Norbert's thoughts fell upon this bottle, and in his
      mind's eye he could see it standing in its accustomed place. He crossed
      the courtyard, and the laborers, engaged in their tasks, gazed at him
      curiously. He passed them, and entered the dining-room, which was
      untenanted. With a caution that was not to be expected from the agitation
      of his mind, he opened each door successively, in order to be certain that
      no eyes were gazing upon him. Then, with the greatest rapidity, he took
      down the bottle, drew the cork with his teeth, and dropped into the wine,
      not one, but two or three pinches of the contents of the little vial. He
      shook the bottle gently, to facilitate the dissolution of the powder. A
      few particles of the poison clung to the lip of the bottle; he wiped off
      these, not with a napkin, a pile of which lay on the shelf beside him, but
      with his own handkerchief. He replaced the bottle in its accustomed place,
      and seating himself by the fire, awaited the course of events.
    
    
      At this moment the Duke de Champdoce was coming up the avenue at a rapid
      pace. For the first time, perhaps, in his life, this man perceived that
      one of his last acts had been insensate and foolish in the extreme. All
      the possibilities of the law to which Daumon had alluded struck the Duke
      with over-whelming force, and he at once saw that his violent conduct had
      given ample grounds upon which to base a plaint, with results which he
      greatly feared. If the court entertained the matter, his son would most
      likely be removed from his control. He knew that such an idea would never
      cross Norbert's brain, but there were plenty of persons to suggest it to
      him. The danger of his position occurred to him, and at the same time he
      felt that he must frame his future conduct with extreme prudence. He had
      not given up his views regarding his son's marriage with Mademoiselle de
      Puymandour. No; he would sooner have resigned life itself, but he felt
      that he must renounce violence, and gain his ends by diplomacy. The first
      thing to be done was to get Norbert to return home, and the father greatly
      doubted whether the son would do so. While thinking over these things,
      with a settled gloom upon his face, one of the servants came running up to
      him with the news of Norbert's return.
    
    
      "I hold him at last," muttered he, and hastened on to the Chateau.
    
    
      When the Duke entered the dining-room, Norbert did not rise from his seat,
      and the Duke was disagreeably impressed by this breach of the rules of
      domestic etiquette.
    
    
      "On my word," thought he, "it would appear that the young booby thinks
      that he owes me no kind of duty whatever."
    
    
      He did not, however, allow his anger to be manifest in his features;
      besides, the sight of the blood, with which his son's face was still
      smeared, caused him to feel excessively uncomfortable.
    
    
      "Norbert, my son," said he, "are you suffering? Why have you not had that
      cut attended to?"
    
    
      The young man made no reply, and the Duke continued,       
    
    
      "Why have you not washed the blood away? Is it left there as a reproach to
      me? There is no need for that, I assure you; for deeply do I deplore my
      violence."
    
    
      Norbert still made no answer, and the Duke became more and more
      embarrassed. To give himself time for reflection, more than because he was
      thirsty, he took a glass, and filled it from his own special bottle.
    
    
      Norbert trembled from head to foot as he saw this act.
    
    
      "Come, my son," continued the Duke, "just try if you cannot find some
      palliation for what your old father has done. I am ready to ask your
      forgiveness, and to apologize, for a man of honor is never ashamed to
      acknowledge when he has been in the wrong."
    
    
      He raised his glass, and raised it up to the light half mechanically.
      Norbert held his breath; the whole world seemed turning round.
    
    
      "It is hard, very hard," continued the Duke, "for a father thus to
      humiliate himself in vain before his son."
    
    
      It was useless for Norbert to turn away his head; he saw the Duke place
      the glass to his lips. He was about to drink, but the young man could
      endure it no longer, and with a bound he sprang forward, snatched the
      glass from his father's hand, and hurled it from the window, shouting in a
      voice utterly unlike his own,       
    
    
      "Do not drink."
    
    
      The Duke read the whole hideous truth in the face and manner of his son.
      His features quivered, his face grew purple, and his eyes filled with
      blood. He strove to speak, but only an inarticulate rattle could be heard;
      he then clasped his hands convulsively, swayed backwards and forwards, and
      then fell helplessly backwards, striking his head against an oaken
      sideboard that stood near. Norbert tore open the door.
    
    
      "Quick, help!" cried he. "I have killed my father."
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER IX.
    
    
      THE HONOR OF THE NAME.
    
    
      The account that the Duke of Champdoce had given of M. de Puymandour's mad
      longing for rank and title was true, and afforded a melancholy instance of
      that peculiar kind of foolish vanity. He was a much happier man in his
      younger days, when he was known simply as Palouzet, which was his father's
      name, whose only wish for distinction was to be looked upon as an honest
      man. In those days he was much looked up to and respected, as a man who
      had possessed brains enough to amass a very large fortune by strictly
      honest means. All this vanished, however, when the unhappy idea occurred
      to him to affix the title of Count to the name of an estate that he had
      recently purchased.
    
    
      From that moment, all his tribulations in life may have been said to have
      commenced. The nobility laughed at his assumption of hereditary rank,
      while the middle classes frowned at his pretensions to be superior to
      them, so that he passed the existence of a shuttlecock, continually
      suspended in the air, and struck at and dismissed from either side.
    
    
      It may, therefore, be easily imagined how excessively anxious he was to
      bring about the marriage between his daughter Marie and the son of that
      mighty nobleman, the Duke of Champdoce. He had offered to sacrifice
      one-third of his fortune for the honor of forming this connection, and
      would have given up the whole of it, could he but have seen a child in
      whose veins ran the united blood of Palouzet and the Champdoce seated upon
      his knee. A marriage of this kind would have given him a real position;
      for to have a Champdoce for a son-in-law would compel all scoffers to
      bridle their tongues.
    
    
      The day after he had received a favorable reply from the Duke, M. de
      Puymandour thought that it was time to inform his daughter of his
      intentions. He never thought that she would make any opposition, and, of
      course, supposed that she would be as delighted as he was at the honor
      that awaited her. He was seated in a magnificently furnished room which he
      called his library when he arrived at this conclusion, and ringing the
      bell, ordered the servant to inquire of mademoiselle's maid if her
      mistress could grant him an interview. He gave this curious message, which
      did not appear to surprise the servant in the least, with an air of the
      utmost importance. The communication between the father and daughter was
      always carried on upon this basis; and scoffers wickedly asserted that M.
      de Puymandour had modelled it upon a book of etiquette, for the guidance
      of her household, written by a venerable arch-duchess.
    
    
      Shortly after the man had departed on his errand, a little tap came to the
      door.
    
    
      "Come in," exclaimed M. de Puymandour.
    
    
      And Mademoiselle Marie ran in and gave her father a kiss upon each cheek.
      He frowned slightly, and extricated himself from her embrace.
    
    
      "I thought it better to come to you, my dear father," said she, "than to
      give you the trouble of coming all the way to me."
    
    
      "You always forget that there are certain forms and ceremonies necessary
      for a young lady of your position."
    
    
      Marie gave a little gentle smile, for she was no stranger to her father's
      absurd whims; but she never thwarted them, for she was very fond of him.
      She was a very charming young lady, and in the description that the Duke
      had given of her to his son, he had not flattered her at all. Though she
      differed greatly in appearance from Mademoiselle de Laurebourg, Marie's
      beauty was perfect in a style of its own. She was tall and well
      proportioned, and had all that easy grace of movement, characteristic of
      women of Southern parentage. Her large soft dark eyes offered a vivid
      contrast to her creamy complexion; her hair, in utter disregard of the
      fashionable mode of dressing, was loosely knotted at the back of her head.
      Her nature was soft and affectionate, capable of the deepest devotion,
      while she had the most equable temper that can be imagined.
    
    
      "Come, my dear papa," said she; "do not scold me any more. You know that
      the Marchioness of Arlanges has promised to teach me how to behave myself
      according to all the rules of fashionable society next winter, and I
      declare to you that I will so practise them up in secret, that you will be
      astonished when you behold them."
    
    
      "How woman-like!" muttered her father. "She only scoffs at matters of the
      most vital importance."
    
    
      He rose from his seat, and, placing his back to the fireplace, took up an
      imposing position, one hand buried in his waistcoat, and the other ready
      to gesticulate as occasion required.
    
    
      "Oblige me with your deepest attention," commenced he. "You were eighteen
      years of age last month, and I have an important piece of intelligence to
      convey to you. I have had an offer of marriage for you."
    
    
      Marie looked down, and endeavored to hide her confusion at these tidings.
    
    
      "Before coming to a conclusion upon a matter of such importance,"
      continued he, "it was, of course, necessary for me to go into the question
      most thoroughly. I spared no means of obtaining information, and I am
      quite certain that the proposed connection would be conducive to your
      future happiness. The suitor for your hand is but little older than
      yourself; he is very handsome, very wealthy, and is a Marquis by
      hereditary right."
    
    
      "Has he spoken to you then?" inquired Marie in tones of extreme agitation.
    
    
      "He! Whom do you mean by he?" asked M. de Puymandour; and as his daughter
      did not reply, he repeated his question.
    
    
      "Who? Why, George de Croisenois."
    
    
      "Pray, what have you to do with Croisenois? Who is he, pray? Not that
      dandy with a mustache, that I have seen hanging about you this winter?"
    
    
      "Yes," faltered Marie; "that is he."
    
    
      "And why should you presume that he had asked me for your hand? Did he
      tell you that he was going to do so?"
    
    
      "Father, I declare              "
    
    
      "What, the daughter of a Puymandour has listened to a declaration of love
      unknown to her father? Ten thousand furies! Has he written to you? Where
      are those letters?"
    
    
      "My dear father       "
    
    
      "Silence; have you those letters? Let me see them. Come, no delay; I will
      have those bits of paper, if I turn the whole house upside down."
    
    
      With a sigh Marie gave the much prized missives to her father; there were
      four only, fastened together with a morsel of blue ribbon.
    
    
      He took one out at random, and read it aloud, with a running fire of oaths
      and invectives as a commentary upon its contents.
    
    
      "MADEMOISELLE,       
    
    
      "Though there is nothing upon earth that I dread so much as your anger, I
      dare, in spite of your commands to the contrary, to write to you once
      again. I have learned that you are about to quit Paris for several months.
      I am twenty-four years of age. I have neither father nor mother, and am
      entirely my own master. I belong to an ancient and honorable family. My
      fortune is a large one, and my love for you is of the most honorable and
      devoted kind. My uncle, M. de Saumeuse, knows your father well; and will
      convey my proposals to him upon his return from Italy, in about two or
      three weeks' time. Once more intreating you to forgive me,
    
    
      "I remain,
    
    
      "Yours respectfully,
    
    
      "GEORGE DE CROISENOIS."
    
    
      "Very pretty indeed," said M. de Puymandour, as he replaced the letter in
      its envelope. "This is sufficient, and I need not read the others; but
      pray, what answer did you give?"
    
    
      "That I must refer him to you, my dear father."
    
    
      "Indeed, on my word, you do me too much honor; and did you really think
      that I would listen to such proposals? Perhaps you love him?"
    
    
      She turned her lovely face towards her father, with the great tears
      rolling down her cheeks for her sole reply.
    
    
      This mute confession, for as such he regarded it, put the finishing touch
      to M. de Puymandour's exasperation.
    
    
      "You absolutely love him, and have the impudence to tell me so?"
    
    
      Marie glanced at her father, and answered,       
    
    
      "The Marquis de Croisenois is of good family."
    
    
      "Pooh! you know nothing about it. Why, the first Croisenois was one of
      Richelieu's minions, and Louis XIII. conferred the title for some shady
      piece of business which he carried out for him. Has this fine Marquis any
      means of livelihood?"
    
    
      "Certainly; about sixty thousand francs a year."
    
    
      "Humbug! What did he mean by addressing you secretly? Only to compromise
      your name, and so to secure your fortune, and perhaps to break off your
      marriage with another."
    
    
      "But why suppose this?"
    
    
      "I suppose nothing; I am merely going upon facts. What does a man of honor
      do when he falls in love?"
    
    
      "My dear father       "
    
    
      "He goes to his solicitor, acquaints him with his intentions, and explains
      what his means are; the solicitor goes to the family solicitor of the
      young lady, and when these men of the law have found out that all is
      satisfactory, then love is permitted to make his appearance upon the
      scene. And now you may as well attend to me. Forget De Croisenois as soon
      as you can, for I have chosen a husband for you, and, having pledged my
      word of honor, I will abide by it. On Sunday the eligible suitor will be
      introduced to you, and on Monday we will visit the Bishop, asking him to
      be good enough to perform the ceremony. On Tuesday you will show yourself
      in public with him, in order to announce the betrothal. Wednesday the
      marriage contract will be read. Thursday a grand dinner-party. Friday an
      exhibition of the marriage presents; Saturday a day of rest; Sunday the
      publication of the banns, and at the end of the following week the
      marriage will take place."
    
    
      Mademoiselle Marie listened to her father's determination with intense
      horror.
    
    
      "For pity's sake, my dear father, be serious," cried she.
    
    
      M. de Puymandour paid no attention to her entreaty, but added, as an
      afterthought:
    
    
      "Perhaps you would wish to know the name of the gentleman I have selected
      as a husband for you. He is the Marquis Norbert, the son and heir of the
      Duke de Champdoce."
    
    
      Marie turned deadly pale.
    
    
      "But I do not know him; I have never seen him," faltered she.
    
    
      "I know him, and that is quite sufficient. I have often told you
      that you should be a duchess, and I mean to keep my word."
    
    
      Marie's affection for George de Croisenois was much deeper than she had
      told her father, much deeper even than she had dared to confess to
      herself, and she resented this disposal of her with more obstinacy than
      any one knowing her gentle nature would have supposed her capable of; but
      M. de Puymandour was not the man to give up for an instant the object
      which he had sworn to attain. He never gave his daughter an instant's
      peace, he argued, insisted, and bullied until, after three days' contest,
      Marie gave her assent with a flood of tears. The word had scarcely passed
      her lips, before her father, without even thanking her for her terrible
      sacrifice, exclaimed in a voice of triumph:
    
    
      "I must take these tidings to Champdoce without a moment's delay."
    
    
      He started at once, and as he passed through the doorway said:
    
    
      "Good-by, my little duchess, good-by."
    
    
      He was most desirous of seeing the Duke, for, on taking leave of him, the
      old nobleman had said, "You shall hear from me to-morrow;" but no letter
      had as yet reached him from Champdoce. This delay however, had suited M.
      de Puymandour's plans, for it had enabled him to wring the consent from
      his daughter; but now that this had been done, he began to feel very
      anxious, and to fear that there might be some unforeseen hitch in the
      affair.
    
    
      When he reached Bevron, he saw Daumon talking earnestly with Francoise,
      the daughter of the Widow Rouleau. M. de Puymandour bowed graciously, and
      stopped to talk with the man, for he was just now seeking for popularity,
      as he was a candidate, and the elections would shortly take place; and,
      besides, he never failed to talk to persons who exercised any degree of
      influence, and he knew that Daumon was a most useful man in
      electioneering.
    
    
      "Good morning, Counsellor," said he gayly. "What is the news to-day?"
    
    
      Daumon bowed profoundly.
    
    
      "Bad news, Count," answered he. "I hear that the Duke de Champdoce is
      seriously indisposed."
    
    
      "The Duke ill       impossible!"
    
    
      "This girl has just given me the information. Tell us all about it,
      Francoise."
    
    
      "I heard to-day at the Chateau that the doctors had quite given him over."
    
    
      "But what is the matter with him?"
    
    
      "I did not hear."
    
    
      M. de Puymandour stood perfectly aghast.
    
    
      "It is always the way in this world," Daumon philosophically said. "In the
      midst of life we are in death!"
    
    
      "Good morning, Counsellor," said De Puymandour; "I must try and find out
      something more about this."
    
    
      Breathless, and with his mind filled with anxiety, he hurried on.
    
    
      All the servants and laborers on the Champdoce estate were gathered
      together in a group, talking eagerly to each other, and as soon as M. de
      Puymandour appeared, one of the servants, disengaging himself from his
      fellows, came towards him. This was the Duke's old, trustworthy servant.
    
    
      "Well?" exclaimed M. de Puymandour.
    
    
      "Oh, sir," cried the old man, "this is too horrible; my poor master will
      certainly die."
    
    
      "But I do not know what is the matter with him; no one has told me
      anything, in fact."
    
    
      "It was terribly sudden," answered the man. "It was about this time the
      day before yesterday that the Duke was alone with M. Norbert in the
      dining-room. All at once we heard a great outcry. We ran in and saw my
      poor master lying senseless on the ground, his face purple and distorted."
    
    
      "He must have had a fit of apoplexy."
    
    
      "Not exactly; the doctor called it a rush of blood to the brain; at least,
      I think that is what he said, and he added that the reason he did not die
      on the spot was because in falling he had cut open his head against the
      oaken sideboard, and the wound bled profusely. We carried him up to his
      bed; he showed no signs of life, and now              "
    
    
      "Well, how is he now?"
    
    
      "No one dare give an opinion; my poor master is quite unconscious, and
      should he recover       and I do not think for a moment that he will       the
      doctor says his mind will have entirely gone."
    
    
      "Horrible! Too horrible! And a man of such intellectual power, too. I
      shall not ask you to let me look at him, for I could do no good, and the
      sight would upset me. But can I not see M. Norbert?"
    
    
      "Pray, do not attempt to do so, sir."
    
    
      "I was his father's intimate friend, and if the condolences of such a one
      could assuage the affliction under which       "
    
    
      "Impossible!" answered the man in a quick, eager manner. "M. Norbert was
      with his father at the time of his seizure, and has given strict orders
      that he is not to be disturbed on any account; but I must go to him at
      once, for we are expecting the physicians who are coming from Poitiers."
    
    
      "Very well, then I will go now, but to-night I will send up one of my
      people for news."
    
    
      With these words, M. de Puymandour walked slowly away, absorbed in
      thought. The manner and expression of the servant had struck him as
      extremely strange. He noted the fact that Norbert was alone with his
      father at the time of the seizure, and, recalling to mind the opposition
      he had met with from his daughter, he began to imagine that the Duke had
      found his son rebellious, and that the apoplectic fit had been brought on
      by a sudden access of passion. Interest and ambition working together
      brought him singularly near the truth.
    
    
      "If the Duke dies, or becomes a maniac," thought he to himself, "the end
      as regards us will be the same for Norbert will break off the match to a
      certainty."
    
    
      He felt that such a proceeding would cause him to be more jeered at and
      ridiculed than ever, and that the only path of escape left open to him was
      to marry his daughter to the Marquis de Croisenois, which was a most
      desirable alliance, in spite of all he had said against it. A voice close
      to his ear aroused him from his reflections: it was that of Daumon, who
      had come up unperceived.
    
    
      "Was the girl's information correct, Count?" asked he. "How are the Duke
      and M. Norbert, for of course you have seen them both?"
    
    
      "M. Norbert is too much agitated by the sad event to see any one."
    
    
      "Of course that was to be looked for," returned the wily Counsellor; "for
      the seizure was terribly sudden."
    
    
      M. de Puymandour was too much occupied with his own thoughts to spare much
      pity for Norbert. He would have given a great deal to have known what the
      young man was doing, and especially what he was thinking of at the present
      moment.
    
    
      The poor lad was standing by the bedside of his dying father, watching
      eagerly for some indication, however slight, of returning life or reason.
      The hours of horror and self-reproach had entirely changed his feelings
      and ideas; for it was only at the instant when he saw his father raise the
      poisoned wine to his lips that he saw his crime in all its hideous
      enormity. His soul rose up in rebellion against his crime, and the words,
      "Parricide! murderer!" seemed to ring in his ears like a trumpet call.
      When his father fell to the ground, his instinct made him shout for aid;
      but an instant afterwards terror took possession of him, and, rushing from
      the house, he sought the open country, as though striving to escape from
      himself.
    
    
      Jean, the old servant, who had noticed Norbert's strange look, was seized
      with a terrible fear. Trusted as he was by both the Duke and his son, he
      had many means of knowing all that was going on in the household, and was
      no stranger to the differences that had arisen recently between father and
      son. He knew how violent the tempers of both were, and he also knew that
      some woman was urging on Norbert to a course of open rebellion. He had
      seen the cruel blow dealt by the Duke, and had wondered greatly when he
      saw Norbert return to the Chateau. Why had he done so? He had been in the
      courtyard when Norbert threw the glass from the window. Putting all these
      circumstances together, as soon as the inanimate body of the Duke had been
      laid upon a bed, Jean went into the dining-room, feeling sure that he
      should make some discovery which would confirm his suspicions. The bottle
      from which the Duke had filled his glass stood half emptied upon the
      table. With the greatest care, he poured a few drops of its contents into
      the hollow of his hand, and tasted it with the utmost caution. The wine
      still retained its customary taste and scent. Not trusting, however, to
      this, Jean, after making sure that he was not observed, carried the bottle
      to his own room, and concealed it. After taking this precaution, he
      ordered one of the other servants to remain by the side of the Duke until
      the arrival of the doctor, and then went in search of Norbert.
    
    
      For two hours his efforts were fruitless. Giving up his search in despair,
      he turned once more to regain the Chateau, and, taking the path through
      the wood, suddenly perceived a human form stretched on the turf beneath a
      tree. He moved cautiously towards the figure, and at once recognized
      Norbert. The faithful servant bent over his young master, and shook him by
      the arm to arouse him from his state of stupor. At the first touch,
      Norbert started to his feet with a shriek of terror. With mingled fear and
      pity, Jean noticed the look that shone in the young man's eyes, more like
      that of some hunted animal than a human being.
    
    
      "Do not be alarmed, M. Norbert; it is only I," said he.
    
    
      "And what do you want?"
    
    
      "I came to look for you, and to entreat you to come back with me to
      Champdoce."
    
    
      "Back to Champdoce?" repeated Norbert hoarsely; "no, never!"
    
    
      "You must, Master Norbert; for your absence now would cause a terrible
      scandal. Your place at this critical time is by the bedside of your
      father."
    
    
      "Never! never!" repeated the poor boy; but he yielded passively when Jean
      passed his arm through his, and led him away towards the Chateau.
      Supported thus by the old man's arm, he crossed the courtyard, and
      ascended the staircase; but at his father's door he withdrew his hand, and
      struggled to get away.
    
    
      "I will not; no, no, I cannot," gasped he.
    
    
      "You must and you shall," returned the old man firmly. "Whatever your
      feelings may be, no stain shall rest on the family honor."
    
    
      These words roused Norbert; he stepped across the room, and dropped on his
      knees by the bed, placing his forehead upon his father's icy hand. He
      burst into a passion of tears and sobs, and the simple peasants, who
      surrounded the couch of the insensible nobleman, breathed a sigh; for,
      from his pallid face and burning eyes, they believed he must be mad. They
      were not far out in this surmise; but the tears relieved his over-wrought
      brain, and with this relief came the sense of intense suffering. When the
      physician arrived, he was able to appear before him merely as a deeply
      anxious son.
    
    
      "There is no hope for the Duke, I regret to say," said the medical man,
      who felt that it was useless to keep Norbert in suspense. "There is a
      feeble chance of saving his life; but even should we succeed in doing so,
      his intellect will be irretrievably gone. This is a sad truth, but I feel
      it my duty to inform you of it. I will come again to-morrow."
    
    
      As the doctor left the room, Norbert threw himself into a chair, and
      clasped his hands round his head, which throbbed until it seemed as if it
      would burst. For more than half an hour he sat motionless, and then
      started to his feet with a stifled cry; for he remembered the bottle into
      which he had poured the poison, and which had been left on the table. Had
      any one drunk from it? What had become of it? The agony of his mind gave
      him the necessary strength to descend to the dining-room; but the bottle
      was not on the table, nor was it in its customary place in the cupboard.
      The unhappy boy was looking for it everywhere, when the door silently
      opened, and Jean appeared on the threshold. The expression upon his young
      master's face so startled the faithful old man that he nearly dropped the
      lighted candle that he carried in his hand.
    
    
      "Why are you here, Master Norbert?" asked he in a voice that trembled with
      emotion.
    
    
      "I was looking for              I wanted to find              ," faltered
      Norbert.
    
    
      Jean's suspicions at once became certainties; he walked up to his young
      master, and whispered in his ear,       
    
    
      "You are looking for the Duke's bottle of wine, are you not? It is quite
      safe; for I have taken it to my room. To-morrow the contents shall be
      emptied away, and there will be no proof existing."
    
    
      Jean spoke in such a low voice that Norbert guessed rather than heard his
      words, and yet it seemed that the accusing whisper resounded like thunder
      through the Chateau, filling the old house from cellar to roof-tree.
    
    
      "Be quiet," said he, laying his hand on the old man's lips, and gazing
      around him with wild and affrighted glances.
    
    
      A more complete confession could hardly have been made.
    
    
      "Fear nothing, Master Norbert," answered Jean; "we are quite alone. I know
      that there are words which should never be even breathed; and if I have
      ventured to speak, it was because it was my duty to warn you, and to
      inculcate on you the necessity of caution."
    
    
      Norbert was filled with horror when he saw that the old man believed him
      to be really guilty.
    
    
      "Jean," cried he, "you are wrong in your suspicions. I tell you that my
      father never tasted that wine. I snatched the glass from him before his
      lips had touched it. I flung it out into the courtyard, and, if you
      search, you will find its scattered fragments there still."
    
    
      "I am not sitting in judgment upon you; what you tell me to believe I am
      ready to accept."
    
    
      "Ah!" cried Norbert passionately, "he does not believe me; he thinks that
      I am guilty. I swear to you by all that I hold most sacred in this world,
      that I am innocent of this deed."
    
    
      The attached servant shook his head with a melancholy air.
    
    
      "Of course, of course," said he; "but it is for us two to save the honor
      of the house of Champdoce. Should it happen that any suspicions should be
      aroused, put all the guilt upon my shoulders. I will defend myself in a
      manner which will only fix the crime more firmly upon me. I will not throw
      away the bottle, but will retain it in my room, so that it may be found
      there, and its contents will be a damnatory evidence against me. What
      matters it how a poor man like me is sent out of the world? but with you
      it is different. You       "
    
    
      Norbert wrung his hands in abject despair; the sublime devotion of the old
      servant showed how firmly Jean believed in his criminality. He was about
      to assert his innocence further, when the loud sound of a closing door was
      heard above stairs.
    
    
      "Hush!" said the old man; "some one approaches; we must not be seen
      whispering together like two plotters, for their suspicions would be
      certainly awakened; and I fear that my face or your eyes will reveal the
      secret. Quick, go upstairs, and endeavor, as soon as possible, to resume
      your calmness. I beg you not to compromise the honor of your name, which
      is in deadly peril."
    
    
      Without another word Norbert obeyed. His father was alone, and only the
      man to whom Jean had delegated the task of watcher remained by his
      bedside. At the sight of his young master he rose.
    
    
      "The prescription which the doctor ordered to be made up has arrived,"
      said he. "I have administered a dose to the Duke, and it seems to me that
      the result has been favorable."
    
    
      Norbert drew up a heavy arm-chair to the foot of the bed, and took his
      seat upon it. From this position he could see his father's face. His brain
      was dazed, and it was with the utmost difficulty that he could recall the
      chain of events which had drawn him towards the abyss into which he had so
      nearly been precipitated.
    
    
      The veil had been taken from his eyes, and he now saw with perfect
      clearness and seemed again to hear his father's voice as it roughly warned
      him that the woman he loved was a mere plotter, who cared not for him, but
      was scheming for his fortune and his name. Then he had been furiously
      indignant and looked upon the words as almost blasphemous, but now he saw
      that his father was right. How was it that he had not before seen that
      Diana was flinging herself in his way, and that all her affected openness
      and simplicity were merely the perfections of art, and that step by step
      she had led him to the brink of the terrible precipice which yawned before
      him? The whole hideous part as played by Daumon was no longer a sealed
      book to him. She whom he had looked on as a pure and innocent girl was
      merely the accomplice of a scheming villain like the Counsellor, and after
      exciting his hatred and anger almost to madness, had placed the poison
      which was to take his father's life in his hands. A cold shiver ran
      through him as he realized this, and all his ardent love for Diana de
      Laurebourg was changed into a feeling of loathing and disgust.
    
    
      At last the first pale rays of dawn broke through the casement, but before
      that Norbert, worn out with conflicting emotions, had fallen into a
      restless and uneasy sleep, and when he awoke the doctor was standing by
      the bedside of the sick man. At the first sound made by Norbert as he
      stirred in the chair, the doctor came towards him, saying, "We shall
      preserve his life."
    
    
      This prognostication was complete, for that very evening the Duke de
      Champdoce was able to move in his bed, the next day he uttered some
      incoherent words, and later on asked for food; but the will of iron had
      passed away, the features had lost their expression of determination, and
      the eye the glitter of pride and power. Never again would the Duke be able
      to exert that keen, stern intellect which had enabled him to influence all
      those around him; and in this terrible state of imbecility the haughty
      nobleman would ever remain, fed and looked after like a child, with no
      thought beyond his desires and his warm fire, and without a care for
      anything that was going on in the world around him.
    
    
      After the enormity of his crime had been brought before him, the greatness
      of the punishment that he must endure now came across Norbert's mind. It
      was only now that Jean had ventured to tell him of M. de Puymandour's
      visit; and such a change had taken place in Norbert that he looked upon
      this visit as a special arrangement made by Providence.
    
    
      "My father's will shall be carried out in every respect," said he to
      himself, and without an hour's delay he wrote to M. de Puymandour, begging
      him to call, and hoping that the grief which had fallen upon him had in no
      way altered the plan which had already been arranged.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER X.
    
    
      A THUNDERBOLT.
    
    
      As the miner, who sets fire to the fuse and seeks shelter from the coming
      explosion, so did Diana de Laurebourg return to her father's house after
      her visit to Daumon. During dinner it was impossible for her to utter a
      word, and it was with the greatest difficulty that she succeeded in
      swallowing a mouthful. Fortunately neither her father nor mother took any
      notice of her. They had that day received a letter announcing the news
      that their son, for whose future prosperity they had sacrificed Diana, was
      lying dangerously ill in Paris, where he was living in great style. They
      were in terrible affliction, and spoke of starting at once, so as to be
      with him. They therefore expressed no surprise when, on leaving the table,
      Diana pleaded a severe headache as an excuse for retiring to her own room.
      When once she was alone, having dismissed her maid, she heaved a deep sigh
      of relief. She never thought of retiring to bed, but throwing open her
      window, leaned out with her elbow on the window-sill.
    
    
      It seemed to her that Norbert would certainly make some effort to see her,
      or at any rate by some means to let her know whether he had succeeded or
      failed.
    
    
      "But I must be patient," murmured she, "for I can't hear anything until
      the afternoon of to-morrow."
    
    
      In spite, however, of her resolutions, patience fled from her mind, and as
      soon as the servants had begun moving about, she went out into the garden
      and took up a position which commanded a view of the highroad, but no one
      appeared. The bell rang for breakfast. Again she had to seat herself at
      table with her parents, and the terrible penance of the past evening had
      to be repeated. At three o'clock she could endure the suspense no longer,
      and making her escape from the Chateau, she went over to Daumon, who, she
      felt, must have obtained some intelligence. Even if she found that he knew
      nothing, it would be a relief to speak to him and to ask him when he
      thought that this terrible delay would come to an end. But she got no
      comfort at Daumon's, for he had passed as miserable a night as herself,
      and was nearly dead with affright. He had remained in his office all the
      morning, starting at the slightest sound, and though he was as anxious as
      Diana for information, he had only gone out a little before her arrival.
      He met Mademoiselle Laurebourg on his return at the door of his cottage,
      and taking her inside, he informed her that at a late hour the night
      before the doctor had been sent for to Champdoce to attend the Duke, who
      was supposed to be dying. Then he reproved her bitterly for her imprudence
      in visiting him.
    
    
      "Do you wish," said he, "to show all Bevron that you and I are Norbert's
      accomplices?"
    
    
      "What do you mean?" asked she.
    
    
      "I mean that if the Duke does not die, we are lost. When I say we, I mean
      myself, for you, as the daughter of a noble family, will be sure to escape
      scot free, and I shall be left to pay for all."
    
    
      "You said that the effect was immediate."
    
    
      "I did say so, and I thought so too. Ah, if I had but reflected a little!
      You will however see that I do not intend to give in without a fight. I
      will defend myself by accusing you. I am an honest man, and have been your
      dupe. You have thought to make me a mere tool; your fine Norbert is a
      fool, but he will pay for his doings with his head all the same."
    
    
      At these gross insults Mademoiselle de Laurebourg rose to her feet and
      attempted to speak, but he cut her short.
    
    
      "I can't stop to pick and choose my words, for I feel at the present
      moment as if the axe of the guillotine were suspended over my head. Now
      just oblige me by getting out of this, and never show your face here
      again."
    
    
      "As you like. I will communicate with Champdoce."
    
    
      "You shall not," exclaimed Daumon with a gesture of menace. "You might as
      well go and ask how the Duke enjoyed the taste of the poison."
    
    
      His words, however, did not deter Diana, for any risk seemed preferable to
      her than the present state of suspense.
    
    
      With a glance of contempt at the Counsellor she left the cottage,
      determined to act as she thought fit.
    
    
      After Diana's departure, Daumon felt too that he must learn how matters
      were going on, and going over to the Widow Rouleau's, he despatched her
      daughter Francoise to the Chateau de Champdoce, under the pretext that he
      wanted some money which he had lent to one of the Duke's servants. He had
      instructed the girl so cunningly that she had no suspicion of the real end
      and object of her mission, and set out on it with the most implicit
      confidence. He had not long to wait for her return, for in about half an
      hour his messenger returned.
    
    
      "Well," said he anxiously, "has the scamp sent my money?"
    
    
      "No, sir, I am sorry to say that I could not even get to speak to him."
    
    
      "How was that? Was he not at Champdoce?"
    
    
      "I cannot even tell you that. Ever since the Duke has been ill, the great
      gates of the Chateau have been bolted, for it seems that the poor old
      gentleman is at his last gasp."
    
    
      "Did you not hear what was the matter with him?"
    
    
      "No, sir, the little I have told you I got from a stable boy, who spoke to
      me through a grating in the gate, but before he could say ten words Jean
      came up and sent him off."
    
    
      "Do you mean Jean, the Duke's confidential man?"
    
    
      "Just so," returned the girl, "and very angry he was. He abused the lad
      and told him to be off to the stables, and then asked, 'Well, my girl, and
      pray what do you want?' I told him that I had come with a message to the
      man Mechenit; but before I could say any more he broke in with, 'Well, he
      isn't here, you can call again in a month.'"
    
    
      "You silly little fool, was that all you said?"
    
    
      "Not quite, for I said that I must see Mechenit. Then, looking at me very
      suspiciously, he said, 'And who sent you here, you little spy?'"
    
    
      The Counsellor started.
    
    
      "Indeed! and what did you say in return?" asked he.
    
    
      "Why, of course I said that you had sent me."
    
    
      "Yes, yes, that was right."
    
    
      "And then Jean rubbed his hand over his chin, and looking at me very
      curiously, said sternly,       
    
    
      "'So you have come from the Counsellor, have you? Ah, I see it all, and so
      shall he one of these days.'"
    
    
      At these words Daumon felt his knees give way under him; but all further
      questioning was stopped by the appearance of M. de Puymandour on his way
      to Champdoce. He therefore dismissed Francoise, and awaited the return of
      this gentleman, from whom he hoped to gain the fullest information
      regarding the Duke's malady. The intelligence which he received calmed him
      a little, and repenting of his treatment of Diana, he went and hung about
      the gates of the Chateau de Laurebourg, until he was lucky enough to catch
      sight of the girl in the garden, for her anxiety would not permit her to
      remain in the house. He beckoned to her, and then said,       
    
    
      "M. Norbert did not make the dose strong enough. The Duke is as strong as
      a horse; but it is all right, for should he live, he will be an idiot, and
      so our end is as much gained as if he had died."
    
    
      "But why does not Norbert write to me?" asked Diana seriously.
    
    
      "Why, because he has some faint glimmerings of common sense. How do you
      know that he may not have half a dozen spies about him? You must wait."
    
    
      Diana and the Counsellor waited for a week, but Norbert made no sign.
      Diana suffered agonies, and the days seemed to pass with leaden feet.
      Sunday came at last. The Marchioness de Laurebourg had attended early
      Mass, and had given orders that her daughter should go to high Mass under
      the escort of her maid. Diana was highly pleased with this arrangement,
      for she hoped to have a chance of seeing Norbert, but she was
      disappointed. The Mass had commenced when she entered, but the spot
      occupied by the Duke and his son was vacant. She followed the service in a
      purely mechanical manner, and at last noticed that the priest had taken
      his place in the pulpit.
    
    
      This was generally an exciting moment for the inhabitants of Bevron, for
      it was immediately before the sermon that the banns of marriage were
      published. The priest gazed blandly down upon the expectant crowd, coughed
      slightly, used his handkerchief, and finally took from his breviary a
      sheet of paper.
    
    
      "I have," said he, "to publish the banns of marriage between              "
      here he made a little pause, and all the congregation were on the
      tenterhooks of expectation; "between," he continued, "Monsieur Louis
      Norbert, Marquis de Champdoce, a minor, and only legitimate son of
      Guillaume Caesar, Duke de Champdoce, and of his wife Isabella de
      Barnaville, now deceased, but who both formerly resided in this parish,
      and Desiree Anne Marie Palouzet, minor, and legitimate daughter of Rene
      Augustus Palouzet, Count de Puymandour, and of Zoe Staplet, his wife, but
      now deceased, also residents of this parish."
    
    
      This was the thunderbolt launched from the pulpit, which seemed to crush
      Diana into the earth, and her heart almost ceased to beat.
    
    
      "Let any one," continued the priest, "who knows of any impediment to this
      marriage, take warning that he or she must acquaint us with it, under the
      penalty of excommunication. At the same time let him be warned under the
      same penalty to bring forward nothing in malice or without some
      foundation."
    
    
      An impediment! What irony lay veiled beneath that word. Mademoiselle de
      Laurebourg knew of more than one. A wild desire filled her heart to start
      from her seat and cry out,       
    
    
      "It is impossible for this marriage to take place, for that Norbert was
      her affianced husband in the sight of Heaven, and that he was bound to her
      by the strongest of all links, that of crime."
    
    
      But by a gigantic effort she controlled herself, and remained motionless,
      pallid as a spectre, but with a forced smile on her lips, and with
      unparalleled audacity made a little sign to one of her female friends,
      which plainly meant, "This is, indeed, something unexpected." All her mind
      was concentrated to preserve a calm and unmoved aspect. The singing of the
      choir seemed to die away, the strong odor of the incense almost
      overpowered her, and she felt that unless the service soon came to an end,
      she must fall insensible from her chair. At last the priest turned again
      to the congregation and droned out the Ita missa est, and all was
      over. Diana grasped the arm of her maid and forced her away, without
      saying a word. As she reached home, a servant ran up to her with a face
      upon which agitation was strongly painted.
    
    
      "Ah, mademoiselle," gasped he, "such a frightful calamity. Your father and
      mother are expecting you; it is really too terrible."
    
    
      Diana hastened to obey the summons. Her father and mother were seated near
      each other, evidently in deep distress. She went towards them, and the
      Marquis, drawing her to him, pressed her against his heart.
    
    
      "Poor child! My dear daughter!" murmured he, "you are all that is left to
      us now."
    
    
      Their son had died, and the sad news had been brought to the Chateau while
      Diana was at Mass. By her brother's death she had succeeded to a princely
      fortune, and would now be one of the richest heiresses for many a mile
      round. Had this event happened but a week before, her marriage to Norbert
      would have met with no opposition from his father, and she would never
      have plunged into this abyss of crime. It was more than the irony of fate;
      it was the manifest punishment of an angry Divinity. She shed no tear for
      her brother's death. Her thoughts were all firmly fixed on Norbert, and
      that fearful announcement made in the house of God rang still in her ears.
      What could be the meaning of this sudden arrangement, and why had the
      marriage been so suddenly decided on?
    
    
      She felt that some mystery lay beneath it all, and vowed that she would
      fathom it to its nethermost depths. What was it that had taken place at
      Champdoce? Had the Duke, contrary to Daumon's prognostications, recovered?
      Had he discovered his son' insidious attack upon his life, and only
      pardoned it upon a blind compliance being given to his will? She passed
      away the whole day in these vain suppositions, and tried to think of every
      plan to stay the celebration of this union, for she had not given up her
      hopes, nor did she yet despair of ultimate success. Her new and
      unlooked-for fortune placed a fresh weapon at her disposal, and she felt
      that the victory would yet be hers if she could but see Norbert again,
      were it but for a single instant. Was she not certain of the absolute
      power that she exercised over him, for had she not by a few words induced
      him to enter upon the terrible path of crime? She must see him, and that
      without a moment's delay, for the danger was imminent. A day now would be
      worth a year hereafter. She determined that, upon that very night, she
      would visit Champdoce. A little after midnight, when the inhabitants of
      the Chateau were wrapped in slumber, she crept on tiptoe down the grand
      staircase, and made her exit by a side door. She had arranged her plan as
      to how she would find Norbert, for he had often described the interior
      arrangements of the Chateau to her. She knew that his room was on the
      ground floor, with two windows looking on to the courtyard. When, however,
      she reached the old Chateau, she hesitated. Suppose that she should go to
      the wrong window. But she had gone too far to recede, and determined that
      if any one else than Norbert should open the window, she would turn and
      fly. She tapped at the window softly, and then more loudly. She had made
      no mistake. Norbert threw open the window, with the words,       
    
    
      "Who is there?"
    
    
      "It is I, Norbert; I, Diana."
    
    
      "What do you want?" asked Norbert in an agitated tone of voice. "What do
      you want to do here?"
    
    
      She looked at him anxiously and hardly recognized his face, so great was
      the change that had come over it. It absolutely terrified her.
    
    
      "Are you going to marry Mademoiselle de Puymandour?" asked she.
    
    
      "Yes I am."
    
    
      "And yet you pretended to love me?"
    
    
      "Yes, I loved you ardently, devotedly, with a love that drove me to crime;
      but you had no love; you cared but for rank and fortune."
    
    
      Diana raised her hands to heaven in an agony of despair.
    
    
      "Should I be here at this hour if what you say is true?" asked she wildly.
      "My brother is dead, and I am as wealthy as you are, Norbert, and yet I am
      here. You accuse me of being mercenary, and for what reason? Was it
      because I refused to fly with you from my father's house? Oh, Norbert, it
      was but the happiness of our future life that I strove to protect. It was              "
    
    
      Her speech failed her, and her eyes dilated with horror, for the door
      behind Norbert opened, and the Duke de Champdoce entered the room,
      uttering a string of meaningless words, and laughing with that mirthless
      laugh which is so sure a sign of idiotcy.
    
    
      "Can you understand now," exclaimed Norbert, pointing to his father, "why
      the remembrance of my love for you has become a hateful reminiscence? Do
      you dare to talk of happiness to me, when this spectre of a meditated
      crime will ever rise between us?" and with a meaning gesture he pointed to
      the open gate of the courtyard.
    
    
      She turned; but before passing away, she cast a glance upon him full of
      the deepest fury and jealousy. She could not forgive Norbert for his share
      in the crime that she herself prompted,       for the crime which had
      blighted all her hopes of happiness. Her farewell was a menace.
    
    
      "Norbert," she said, as she glided through the gate like a spectre of the
      night, "I will have revenge, and that right soon."
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XI.
    
    
      MARRIAGE BELLS; FUNERAL KNELLS.
    
    
      Three days of hard work had completed all the arrangements necessary for
      the marriage of Norbert and Mademoiselle de Puymandour. He had been
      presented to the lady, and neither had received a favorable impression of
      the other. At the very first glance each one felt that inevitable
      repugnance which the lapse of years can never efface. While dreading the
      anger of her obdurate father, Marie had at one time thought of confiding
      the secret of her attachment to George de Croisenois to Norbert, for she
      had the idea that if she told him that her heart was another's, he might
      withdraw his pretensions to her hand; but several times, when the
      opportunity occurred, fear restrained her tongue, and she let the
      propitious moment pass away. Had she done so, Norbert would at once have
      eagerly grasped at a pretext for absolving himself from a promise which he
      had made mentally of obeying in all things a father who now, alas! had no
      means of enforcing his commands.
    
    
      Each day he paid his visit to Puymandour as an accepted suitor, bearing a
      large bouquet with him, which he regularly presented to his betrothed upon
      his entrance into the drawing-room, which she accepted with a painful
      flush rising to her cheek. The pair conversed upon indifferent topics,
      while an aged female connection sat in the room to play propriety. For
      many hours they would remain thus, the girl bending over her fancy work,
      and he vainly striving to find topics of conversation, and, consequently,
      saying hardly anything, in spite of Marie's feeble efforts to assist in
      the conversation. It was a slight relief when M. de Puymandour proposed a
      walk; but this was a rare occurrence, for that gentleman usually declared
      that he never had a moment's leisure. Never had he seemed so gay and busy
      since the approaching marriage of his daughter had been the theme of every
      tongue. He took all the preparations for the ceremony into his own hands,
      for he had determined that everything should be conducted on a scale of
      unparalleled magnificence. The Chateau was refurnished, and all the
      carriages repainted and varnished, while the Champdoce and the Puymandour
      arms were quartered together on their panels. This coat of arms was to be
      seen everywhere       over the doors, on the walls, and engraved on the
      silver, and it was believed that M. de Puymandour would have made no
      objection to their being branded on his breast.
    
    
      In the midst of all this turmoil and bustle Norbert and Marie grew sadder
      and sadder as each day passed on. One day M. de Puymandour heard so
      astounding a piece of intelligence that he hurried into the drawing-room,
      where he knew that he should find the lovers (as he styled them) together.
    
    
      "Well, my children," exclaimed he, "you have set such an excellent
      example, that everybody seems disposed to copy you, and the mayor and the
      priest will be kept to their work rather tightly this year."
    
    
      His daughter tried to put on an appearance of interest at this speech.
    
    
      "Yes," continued M. de Puymandour, "I have just heard of a marriage that
      will come off almost directly after yours has been celebrated, and will
      make a stir, I can assure you."
    
    
      "And whose is that, pray?"
    
    
      "You are acquainted, I presume," returned the father, addressing himself
      to Norbert, "with the son of the Count de Mussidan?"
    
    
      "What, the Viscount Octave?"
    
    
      "The same."
    
    
      "He lives in Paris, does he not?"
    
    
      "Yes, generally; but he has been staying at Mussidan, and in the short
      space of a week has managed to lose his heart here; and to whom do you
      think? Come, give a guess."
    
    
      "We cannot think who it can be, my dear father," said Marie, "and we are
      devoured with curiosity."
    
    
      "It is reported that the Viscount de Mussidan has proposed for the hand of
      Mademoiselle de Laurebourg."
    
    
      "Why," remarked Marie, "it is only three weeks since her brother died!"
    
    
      Norbert flushed scarlet, and then turned a livid white; so great was his
      agitation at hearing this news, that he nearly dropped the album which he
      held in his hand.
    
    
      "I like the Viscount," continued M. de Puymandour, "while Mademoiselle
      Diana is a charming girl. She is very handsome, and, I believe, has many
      talents; and she is a good model for you to copy, Marie, as you are so
      soon to become a duchess."
    
    
      When he got upon his favorite hobby, it was very difficult to check M. de
      Puymandour. His daughter, therefore, waited until he had concluded, and
      then left the room, under the pretext of giving an order to the servants.
      The Count hardly noticed her absence, as he had still Norbert at his
      mercy.
    
    
      "Reverting again to Mademoiselle Diana," said he: "she looks charming in
      black, for women should look upon a death in the family as a most
      fortunate occurrence; but I ought not to be praising her to you, who are
      so well acquainted with her."
    
    
      "I?" exclaimed Norbert.
    
    
      "Yes, you. I do not suppose that you intend to deny that you have had a
      little flirtation with her?"
    
    
      "I do not understand you."
    
    
      "Well, I do then, my boy; I heard all about your making love to
      her. Why, you are really blushing! What is up now?"
    
    
      "I can assure you              "
    
    
      De Puymandour burst into a loud laugh.
    
    
      "I have heard a good deal of your little country walks, and all the pretty
      things that you used to say to each other."
    
    
      In vain did Norbert deny the whole thing, for his intended father-in-law
      would not believe him; and at last he got so annoyed that he refused to
      remain and dine with the Count, alleging anxiety for his father as an
      excuse. He returned home as soon as he possibly could, much agitated by
      what he had heard; and as he was walking rapidly on, he heard his name
      called by some one who was running after him: Norbert turned round, and
      found himself face to face with Montlouis.
    
    
      "I have been here a week," said the young man. "I am here with my patron,
      for I have one now. I am now with the Viscount de Mussidan, as his private
      secretary. M. Octave is not the most agreeable man in the world to get on
      with, as he gets into the most violent passions on very trivial occasions;
      but he has a good heart, after all, and I am very pleased with the
      position I have gained."
    
    
      "I am very glad to hear it, Montlouis, very much pleased indeed."
    
    
      "And you, Marquis, I hear, are to marry Mademoiselle de Puymandour; I
      could scarcely credit the news."
    
    
      "And why, pray?"
    
    
      "Because I remembered when we used to wait outside a certain garden wall,
      until we saw a certain door open discreetly."
    
    
      "But you must efface all this from your memory, Montlouis."
    
    
      "Do not be alarmed; save to you, my lips would never utter a word of this.
      No one else would ever make me speak."
    
    
      "Stop!" said Norbert, with an angry gesture. "Do you venture to say       "
    
    
      "To say what?"
    
    
      "I wish you to understand that Mademoiselle Diana is as free from blame
      to-day as she was when first I met her. She has been indiscreet, but
      nothing more, I swear it before heaven!"
    
    
      "I believe you perfectly."
    
    
      In reality Montlouis did not believe one word of Norbert's assertion, and
      the young Marquis could read this in his companion's face.
    
    
      "The more so," continued the secretary, "as the young lady is about to be
      married to my friend and patron."
    
    
      "But where," asked Norbert, "did the Viscount meet with Mademoiselle de
      Laurebourg?"
    
    
      "In Paris; the Viscount and her brother were very intimate, and nursed him
      during his last illness, and as soon as the scheming parents heard of the
      Viscount being in the neighborhood they asked him to call on them. Of
      course he did so, and saw Mademoiselle Diana, and returned home in a
      perfect frenzy of love."
    
    
      Norbert seemed so incensed at this that Montlouis broke off his recital,
      feeling confident that the Marquis still loved Diana, and was consumed
      with the flame of jealousy.
    
    
      "But, of course," he added carelessly, "nothing is yet settled."
    
    
      Norbert, however, was too agitated to listen to the idle gossip of
      Montlouis any longer, so he pressed his hand and left him rather abruptly,
      walking away at the top of his speed, leaving his friend silent with
      astonishment. It seemed to Norbert as if he was imprisoned in one of those
      iron dungeons he had read of, which slowly contracted day by day, and at
      last crushed their victims to atoms. He saw Diana married to the Viscount
      de Mussidan, and compelled to meet daily the man who knew all about her
      illicit meetings with her former lover, and who had more than once, when
      Norbert was unable to leave Champdoce, been intrusted with a letter or a
      message for her. And how would Montlouis behave under the circumstances?
      Would he possess the necessary tact and coolness to carry him through so
      difficult a position? What would be the end of this cruel concatenation of
      circumstances? Would Diana be able to endure the compromising witness of
      her youthful error? She would eagerly seek out some pretext for his
      dismissal; he could easily detect this, and in his anger at the loss of a
      position which he had long desired, would turn on her and repeat the whole
      story. Should Montlouis let loose his tongue, the Viscount, indignant at
      the imposition that had been practised upon him, would separate from his
      wife. What would be Diana's conduct when she found herself left thus
      alone, and despised by the society of which she had hoped to be a queen?
      Would she not, in her turn, seek to revenge herself on Norbert? He had
      just asked himself whether at this juncture death would not be a blessing
      to him, when he caught sight of Francoise, the daughter of the Widow
      Rouleau, close by him. For two hours she had been awaiting his coming,
      concealed behind a hedge.
    
    
      "I have something to give you, my lord Marquis," said she.
    
    
      He took the letter that she held out to him, and, opening it, he read,       
    
    
      "You said that I did not love you       perhaps this was but a test to
      prove my love. I am ready to fly with you to-night. I shall lose all, but
      it will be for your sake. Reflect, Norbert; there is yet time, but
      to-morrow it will be too late."
    
    
      These were the words that Mademoiselle de Laurebourg had had the courage
      to pen, which to the former lover were full of the most thrilling
      eloquence. The usually bold, firm writing of Diana was, in the letter
      before him, confused and almost illegible, showing the writer's frame of
      mind. There were blurs and blisters upon the paper as though tears had
      fallen upon it, perhaps because the writing had been made purposely
      irregular and drops of water are an excellent substitute for tears.
    
    
      "Does she really love me?" murmured he.
    
    
      He hesitated; yes, he absolutely hesitated, impressed by the idea that for
      him she was ready to sacrifice position and honor, that he had but to
      raise his finger and she was his, and that in the space of a couple of
      hours she might be the companion of his flight to some far-distant land.
      His pulse throbbed madly, and he could scarcely draw his breath, when some
      fifty paces down the road he caught sight of the figure of a man; it was
      his father. This was the second time that the Duke by his mere presence
      had spread the web of Diana's temptations and allurements.
    
    
      "Never!" exclaimed Norbert, with such fire and energy that the girl fell
      back a pace. "Never! no, never!" and crushing up the letter, he dashed it
      upon the ground, from whence Francoise picked it up as he ran forward to
      meet his father. The Duke had recovered from his attack as far as the mere
      fact of his life not having been sacrificed; he could walk, sleep, eat and
      drink as he had formerly done. He could look at the laborers in the fields
      or the horses in the stables, but five minutes afterwards he had no
      recollection of what he heard or saw. The sudden loss of his father's aid
      would have caused Norbert much embarrassment had it not been for the
      shrewdness and sagacity of M. de Puymandour, who had assisted him greatly.
      But all these arrangements which had to be made had necessarily delayed
      the wedding. But it came at last; M. de Puymandour took absolute
      possession of him, and after the unhappy young man had passed a sleepless
      night, he was allowed no time for reflection. At eleven o'clock he entered
      the carriage, and was driven fast to the Mayor's office, and from thence
      to the chapel, and by twelve o'clock all was finished and he fettered for
      life. A little before dinner the Viscount de Mussidan came to offer his
      congratulations, and gained them at the same time for himself by
      announcing his speedy union with Mademoiselle Diana de Laurebourg.
    
    
      Five days later the newly married pair took possession of their mansion at
      Champdoce. Hampered with a wife whom he had never affected to love, and
      whose tearful face was a constant reproach to him, and with a father who
      was an utter imbecile, the thoughts of suicide more than once crossed
      Norbert's brain. One day a servant informed Norbert that his father
      refused to get up. A doctor was sent for, and he declared that the Duke
      was in a highly critical condition. A violent reaction had taken place,
      and all day the invalid was in a state of intense excitement. The power of
      speech, which he had almost entirely lost, seemed to have returned to him
      in a miraculous manner; at length, however, he became delirious, and
      Norbert dismissed the servants who had been watching by his father's bed,
      lest in the incoherent ravings of the invalid, the words "Parricide" or
      "Poison" should break forth. At eleven o'clock he grew calmer, and slept a
      little, when all at once he started up in bed, exclaiming: "Come here,
      Norbert," and Jean, who had remained by his old master's side, ran up to
      the bed and was much startled at the sight. The Duke had entirely
      recovered his former appearance. His eyes flashed, and his lips trembled,
      as they always did when he was greatly excited.
    
    
      "Pardon, father; pardon," cried Norbert, falling upon his knees.
    
    
      The Duke softly stretched out his hand. "I was mad with family pride,"
      said he; "and God punished me. My son, I forgive you."
    
    
      Norbert's sobs broke the stillness of the chamber.
    
    
      "My son, I renounce my ideas," continued the Duke. "I do not desire you to
      wed Mademoiselle de Puymandour if you feel that you cannot love her."
    
    
      "Father," answered Norbert, "I have obeyed your wishes, and she is now my
      wife."
    
    
      A gleam of terrible anguish passed over the Duke's countenance; he raised
      his hands as though to shield his eyes from some grizzly spectre, and in
      tones of heartrending agony exclaimed: "Too late! Too late!"
    
    
      He fell back in terrible convulsions, and in a moment was dead. If, as has
      been often asserted, the veil of the hereafter is torn asunder, then the
      Duke de Champdoce had a glimpse into a terrible future.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XII.
    
    
      "RASH WORD, RASH DEED."
    
    
      After her repulse by Norbert, Diana, with the cold chill of death in her
      heart, made her way back to the Chateau of the De Laurebourgs, over the
      same road which but a short time before she had traveled full of
      expectation and hope. The sudden appearance of the Duke de Champdoce had
      filled her with alarm, but her imagination was not of that kind upon which
      unpleasant impressions remain for any long period; for after she had
      regained her room, and thrown aside her out-door attire, and removed all
      signs of mud-stains, she once more became herself, and even laughed a
      little rippling laugh at all her own past alarms. Overwhelmed with the
      shame of her repulse, she had threatened Norbert; but as she reasoned
      calmly, she felt that it was not he for whom she felt the most violent
      animosity. All her hatred was reserved for that woman who had come between
      her and her lover       for Marie de Puymandour. Some hidden feeling
      warned her that she must look into Marie's past life for some reason for
      the rupture of her engagement with Norbert, though the banns had already
      been published. This was the frame of mind in which Diana was when the
      Viscount de Mussidan was introduced to her, the friend of the brother
      whose untimely death had left her such a wealthy heiress. He was tall and
      well made, with handsomely chiseled features; and, endowed with physical
      strength and health, Octave de Mussidan had the additional advantages of
      noble descent and princely fortune. Two women, both renowned for their wit
      and beauty, his aunt and his mother, had been intrusted with the education
      which would but enable him to shine in society.
    
    
      Dispatched to Paris, with an ample allowance, at the age of twenty, he
      found himself, thanks to his birth and connections, in the very center of
      the world of fashion. At the sight of Mademoiselle de Laurebourg his heart
      was touched for the first time. Diana had never been more charmingly
      fascinating than she was at this period. Octave de Mussidan did not suit
      her fancy; there was too great a difference between him and Norbert, and
      nothing would ever efface from her memory the recollection of the young
      Marquis as he had appeared before her on the first day of their meeting in
      the Forest of Bevron, clad in his rustic garb, with the game he had shot
      dangling from his hand. She delighted to feast her recollection, and
      thought fondly of his shyness and diffidence when he hardly ventured to
      raise his eyes to hers. Octave, however, fell a victim at the first glance
      he caught of Diana, and permitted himself to be swept away by the tide of
      his private emotions, which upon every visit that he paid to Laurebourg
      became more powerful and resistless. Like a true knight, who wishes that
      he himself should gain the love of his lady fair, Octave addressed himself
      directly to Diana, and after many attempts succeeded in finding himself
      alone with her, and then he asked her if she could permit him to crave of
      her father, the Marquis de Laurebourg, the honor of her hand. This appeal
      surprised her, for she had been so much absorbed in her own troubles that
      she had not even suspected his love for her. She was not even frightened
      at his declaration, as is the patient when the surgeon informs him that he
      must use the knife. She glanced at De Mussidan strangely as he put this
      question to her, and after a moment's hesitation, replied that she would
      give him a reply the next day. After thinking the matter over, she wrote
      and dispatched the letter which Francoise had carried to Norbert. The
      prisoner in the dock as he anxiously awaits the sentence of his judge, can
      alone appreciate Diana's state of agonized suspense as she stood at the
      end of the park at Laurebourg awaiting the return of the girl. Her anxiety
      of mind lasted nearly three hours, when Francoise hurried up breathless.
    
    
      "What did the Marquis say?" asked Diana.
    
    
      "He said nothing; that is, he cried out very angrily, 'Never! no, never!'"
    
    
      In order to prevent any suspicions arising in the girl's mind,
      Mademoiselle de Laurebourg contrived to force a laugh, exclaiming: "Ah!
      indeed, that is just what I expected."
    
    
      Francoise seemed as if she had something to say on the tip of her tongue,
      but Diana hurriedly dismissed her, pressing a coin into her hand. All
      anxiety was now at an end; for her there was no longer any suspense or
      anguish; all her struggles were now futile, and she felt grateful to
      Octave for having given her his love. "Once married," thought she, "I
      shall be free, and shall be able to follow the Duke and Duchess to Paris."
    
    
      Upon her return to the Chateau, she found Octave awaiting her. His eyes
      put the question that his lips did not dare to utter; and, placing her
      hand in his with a gentle inclination of her head, she assented to his
      prayer.
    
    
      This act on her part would, she believed, free her from the past; but she
      was in error. Upon hearing that his dastardly attempt at murder had
      failed, the Counsellor was for the time utterly overwhelmed with terror,
      but the news that he had gained from M. de Puymandour calmed his mind in a
      great measure. He was not, however, completely reassured until he heard
      for certain that the Duke had become a helpless maniac, and that the
      doctor, having given up all hopes of his patient's recovery, had
      discontinued his visits to the Chateau. As soon as he had heard that
      Norbert's marriage had been so soon followed by his father's death, he
      imagined that every cloud had disappeared from the sky. All danger now
      seemed at an end, and he recalled with glee that he had in his strong box
      the promissory notes, signed by Norbert, to the amount of twenty thousand
      francs, which he could demand at any moment, now that Norbert was the
      reigning lord of Champdoce. The first step he took was to hang about the
      neighborhood of Laurebourg, for he thought that some lucky chance would
      surely favor him with an opportunity for a little conversation with
      Mademoiselle Diana. For several days in succession he was unsuccessful,
      but at last he was delighted at seeing her alone, walking in the direction
      of Bevron. Without her suspecting it, he followed her until the road
      passed through a small plantation, when he came up and addressed her.
    
    
      "What do you want with me?" asked she angrily.
    
    
      He made no direct reply; but after apologizing for his boldness, he began
      to offer his congratulations upon her approaching marriage, which was now
      the talk of the whole neighborhood, and which pleased him much, as M. de
      Mussidan was in every way superior to       
    
    
      "Is that all you have to say to me?" asked Diana, interrupting his string
      of words.
    
    
      As she turned from him, he had the audacity to lay his hand upon the edge
      of her jacket.
    
    
      "I have more to say," said he, "if you will honor me with your attention.
      Something about       you can guess what."
    
    
      "About whom or what?" asked she, making no effort to hide her supreme
      contempt.
    
    
      He smiled, glanced around to see that no one was within hearing, and then
      said in a low voice,       
    
    
      "It is about the bottle of poison."
    
    
      She recoiled, as though some venomous reptile had started up in front of
      her.
    
    
      "What do you mean?" cried she. "How dare you speak to me thus?"
    
    
      All his servile manner had now returned to him, and he uttered a string of
      complaints in a whining tone of voice. She had played him a most unfair
      trick, and had stolen a certain little glass bottle from his office; and
      if anything had leaked out, his head would have paid the penalty of a
      crime in which he had no hand. He was quite ill, owing to the suspense and
      anxiety he had endured; sleep would not come to his bed, and the pangs of
      remorse tortured him continually.
    
    
      "Enough," cried Diana, stamping her foot angrily on the ground. "Enough, I
      say."
    
    
      "Well, mademoiselle, I can no longer remain here. I am far too nervous,
      and I wish to go to some foreign country."
    
    
      "Come, let me hear the real meaning of this long preface."
    
    
      Thus adjured, Daumon spoke. He only wished for some little memento to
      cheer his days and nights of exile, some little recognition of his
      services; in fact, such a sum as would bring him in an income of three
      thousand francs.
    
    
      "I understand you," replied Diana. "You wish to be paid for what you call
      your kindness."
    
    
      "Ah, mademoiselle!"
    
    
      "And you put a value of sixty thousand francs upon it; that is rather a
      high price, is it not?"
    
    
      "Alas! it is not half what this unhappy business has cost me."
    
    
      "Nonsense; your demand is preposterous."
    
    
      "Demand!" returned he; "I make no demand. I come to you respectfully and
      with a little charity. If I were to demand, I should come to you in quite
      a different manner. I should say, 'Pay me such and such a sum, or I tell
      everything.' What have I to lose if the whole story comes to light? A mere
      nothing. I am a poor man, and am growing old. You and M. Norbert are the
      ones that have something to fear. You are noble, rich, and young, and a
      happy future lies before you."
    
    
      Diana paused and thought for an instant.
    
    
      "You are speaking," answered she at last, "in a most foolish manner. When
      charges are made against people, proofs must be forthcoming."
    
    
      "Quite right, mademoiselle; but can you say that these proofs are not in
      my hands? Should you, however, desire to buy them, you are at liberty to
      do so. I give you the first option, and yet you grumble."
    
    
      As he spoke, he drew a battered leather pocket-book from his breast, and
      took from it a paper, which, after having been crumpled, had been
      carefully smoothed out again. Diana glanced at it, and then uttered a
      stifled cry of rage and fear, for she at once recognized her last letter
      to Norbert.
    
    
      "That wretch, Francoise, has betrayed me," exclaimed she, "and I saved her
      mother from a death by hunger and cold."
    
    
      The Counsellor held out the letter to her. She thought that he had no
      suspicion of her, and made an attempt to snatch it from him; but he was on
      his guard, and drew back with a sarcastic smile on his face.
    
    
      "No, mademoiselle," said he; "this is not the little bottle of poison;
      however, I will give it to you, together with another one, when I have
      obtained what I ask. Nothing for nothing, however; and if I must go to the
      scaffold, I will do so in good company."
    
    
      Mademoiselle de Laurebourg was in utter despair.
    
    
      "But I have no money," said she. "Where is a girl to find such a sum?"
    
    
      "M. Norbert can find it."
    
    
      "Go to him, then."
    
    
      Daumon made a negative sign with his head.
    
    
      "I am not quite such a fool," answered he; "I know M. Norbert too well. He
      is the very image of his father. But you can manage him, mademoiselle;
      besides, you have much interest in having the matter settled."
    
    
      "Counsellor!"
    
    
      "There is no use in beating about the bush. I come to you humbly enough,
      and you treat me like so much dirt. I will not submit to this, as you will
      find to your cost. I never poisoned any one; but enough of this
      kind of thing. To-day is Tuesday; if on Friday, by six o'clock, I do not
      have what I have asked for, your father and the Count Octave will have a
      letter from me, and perhaps your fine marriage may come to nothing after
      all."
    
    
      This insolence absolutely struck Diana dumb, and Daumon had disappeared
      round a turning of the road before she could find words to crush him for
      his vile attempt at extortion. She felt that he was capable of keeping his
      word, even if by so doing he seriously injured himself without gaining any
      advantage.
    
    
      A nature like Diana's always looks danger boldly in the face. She had,
      however, but little choice how she would act       for to apply to Norbert
      was the only resource left to her       for she knew that he would do all
      in his power to ward off the danger which threatened both of them so
      nearly. The idea, however, of applying to him for aid was repugnant to her
      pride. To what depths of meanness and infamy had she descended! and to
      what avail had been all her aspirations of ambition and grandeur?
    
    
      She was at the mercy of a wretch       of Daumon, in fact. She was forced
      to go as a suppliant to a man whom she had loved so well that she now
      hated him with a deadly hatred. But she did not hesitate for a moment. She
      went straight to the cottage of Widow Rouleau, and despatched Francoise in
      quest of Norbert.
    
    
      She ordered the girl to tell him that he must without fail be at the
      wicket gate in the park wall at Laurebourg on the coming night, where she
      would meet him, and that the matter was one of life and death.
    
    
      As Diana gave these orders to Francoise, the woman's nervous air and
      flushed features plainly showed that she was a mere creature of Daumon's;
      but Mademoiselle de Laurebourg felt it would be unwise to take any notice
      of her discovery, but to abstain from employing her in confidential
      communications for the future.
    
    
      As the hour of the meeting drew near a host of doubts assailed her. Would
      Norbert come to the meeting? Had Francoise contrived to see him? Might he
      not be absent from home? It was now growing dark, and the servants brought
      candles into the dining-room, and Diana, contriving to slip away, gained
      the appointed spot. Norbert was waiting, and when he caught sight of her,
      rushed forward, but stopped as though restrained by a sudden thought, and
      remained still, as if rooted to the ground.
    
    
      "You sent for me, mademoiselle?" said he.
    
    
      "I did."
    
    
      After a pause, in which she succeeded in mastering her emotion, Diana
      began with the utmost volubility to explain the extortion that Daumon was
      endeavoring to practise upon her, magnifying, though there was but little
      need to do so, all the threats and menaces that he had made use of. She
      had imagined that this last piece of roguery on the part of Daumon would
      drive Norbert into a furious passion, but to her surprise it had no such
      effect. He had suffered so much and so deeply, that his heart was almost
      dead against any further emotion.
    
    
      "Do not let this trouble you," answered he apathetically; "I will see
      Daumon and settle with him."
    
    
      "Can you leave me thus, at our last meeting, without even a word?" asked
      she.
    
    
      "What have I to say? My father forgave me on his death-bed, and I pardon
      you."
    
    
      "Farewell, Norbert; we shall see no more of each other. I am going to
      marry, as you have doubtless been informed. Can I oppose my parent's will?
      Besides, what does it signify? Farewell; remember no one wishes more
      sincerely for your future happiness than I do."
    
    
      "Happy!" exclaimed Norbert. "How can I ever be happy again? If you know
      the secret, for pity's sake break it to me. Tell me how to forget and how
      to annihilate thought. Do you not know that I had planned a life of
      perfect happiness with you by my side? I had visions; and now plans and
      visions are alike hateful to me. And as they ever and anon recur to my
      memory, they will fill me with terror and despair."
    
    
      As Diana heard these words of agony, a wild gleam of triumph shot from her
      eyes, but it faded away quickly, and left her cold and emotionless as a
      marble statue; and when she reappeared in the drawing-room, after taking
      leave of Norbert, her face wore so satisfied an expression, that the
      Viscount complimented her upon her apparent happiness.
    
    
      She made some jesting retort, but there was a shade of earnestness mixed
      with her playfulness, for to her future husband she only wished to show
      the amiable side of her character; but all the time she was thinking. Will
      Norbert see Daumon in time?
    
    
      The Duke kept his word, and the next day the faithful Jean discreetly
      handed her a packet. She opened it and found that besides the two letters
      of which the Counsellor had spoken, it contained all her correspondence
      with Norbert       more than a hundred letters in all, some of great
      length, and all of them compromising to a certain extent. Her first
      thought was to destroy them, but on reflection she decided not to do so,
      and hid the packet in the same place as she had concealed the letters
      written by Norbert to her.
    
    
      Norbert had given Daumon sixty thousand francs, and in addition owed him
      twenty thousand on his promissory notes. This sum, in addition to what he
      had already saved, would form such a snug little fortune that it would
      enable the Counsellor to quit Bevron, and take up his abode in Paris,
      where his peculiar talents would have more scope for development. And
      eight days later the village was thrown into a state of intense excitement
      by the fact becoming known that Daumon had shut up his house and departed
      for Paris, taking Francoise, the Widow Rouleau's daughter, with him. The
      Widow Rouleau was furious, and openly accused Mademoiselle de Laurebourg
      of having aided in the committal of the act which had deprived her of her
      daughter's services in her declining years; and the old woman who had
      acted as housekeeper, who on Daumon's departure had thrown open the place,
      did not hesitate to assert that all her late master's legal lore had been
      acquired in prison, where he had undergone a sentence of ten years' penal
      servitude.
    
    
      In spite of all this, however, Mademoiselle de Laurebourg was secretly
      delighted at the departure of Daumon and Francoise; for she experienced an
      intense feeling of relief at knowing that she no longer was in any risk of
      meeting her accomplice in her daily walks. Norbert, too, was going to
      Paris with his wife; and M. de Puymandour was going about saying that his
      daughter, the Duchess of Champdoce, would not return to this part of the
      country for some time to come.
    
    
      Diana drew a long breath of relief, for it seemed to her as if all the
      threatening clouds, which had darkened the horizon, were fast breaking up
      and drifting away. Her future seemed clear, and she could continue the
      preparations for her marriage, which was to be celebrated in a fortnight's
      time; and the friend of Octave who had been asked to act as his best man
      had answered in the affirmative.
    
    
      Diana had taken accurate measurement of the love that Octave lavished upon
      her, and did her utmost to increase it. She had another cruel idea, and
      that was that the bewitching manner which she had assumed towards her
      betrothed was excellent practice, and by it she might judge of her future
      success in society when she resided in Paris. Octave was utterly
      conquered, as any other man would have been under similar circumstances.
    
    
      Upon the day of her wedding she was dazzling in her beauty, and her face
      was radiant with happiness; but it was a mere mask, which she had put on
      to conceal her real feelings. She knew that many curious eyes were fixed
      on her as she left the chapel; and the crowd formed a line for her to pass
      through. She saw many a glance of dislike cast upon her; but a more severe
      blow awaited her, for on her arrival at the Chateau de Mussidan, to which
      she was driven directly after the ceremony, the first person she met was
      Montlouis, who came forward to welcome her. Bold and self-possessed as she
      was, the slight of this man startled her, and a bright flush passed across
      her face. Fortunately Montlouis had had time to prepare himself for this
      meeting, and his face showed no token of recognition. But though his
      salutation was of the most respectful description, Madame de Mussidan
      thought she saw in his eyes that ironical expression of contempt which she
      had more than once seen in Daumon's face.
    
    
      "That man must not, shall not, stay here," she murmured to herself.
    
    
      It was easy enough for her to ask her husband to dismiss Montlouis from
      his employ, but it was a dangerous step to take; and her easiest course
      was to defer the dismissal of the secretary until some really good pretext
      offered itself. Nor was this pretext long in presenting itself; for Octave
      was by no means satisfied with the young man's conduct. Montlouis who had
      been full of zeal while in Paris, had renewed his liaison, on his
      return to Mussidan, with the girl with whom he had been formerly entangled
      at Poitiers. This, of course, could not be permitted to go on, and an
      explosion was clearly to be expected; but what Diana dreaded most was the
      accidental development of some unseen chance.
    
    
      After she had been married some two weeks, when Octave proposed in the
      afternoon that they should go for a walk, she agreed. Her preparations
      were soon completed, and they started off, blithe and lively as children
      on a holiday ramble. As they loitered in a wooded path, they heard a dog
      barking in the cover. It was Bruno, who rushed out, and, standing on his
      hind legs, endeavored to lick Diana's face.
    
    
      "Help, help, Octave!" she exclaimed, and her husband, springing to her
      side, drove away the animal.
    
    
      "Were you very much alarmed, dearest?" asked he.
    
    
      "Yes," answered she faintly; "I was almost frightened to death."
    
    
      "I do not think that he would do you any harm," remarked Octave.
    
    
      "No matter; make him go away;" and as she spoke she struck at him with her
      parasol. But the dog never for a moment supposed that Diana was in
      earnest, and, supposing that she intended to play with him, as she had
      often done before, began to gambol round her, barking joyously the whole
      time.
    
    
      "But this dog evidently knows you, Diana," observed the Viscount.
    
    
      "Know me? Impossible!" and as she spoke Bruno ran up and licked her hand.
      "If he does, his memory is better than mine; at any rate, I am half afraid
      of him. Come, Octave, let us go."
    
    
      They turned away, and Octave would have forgotten all about the occurrence
      had not Bruno, delighted at having found an old acquaintance, persisted in
      following them.
    
    
      "This is strange," exclaimed the Viscount, "very strange indeed. Look
      here, my man," said he, addressing a peasant, who was engaged in clipping
      a hedge by the roadside, "do you know whose dog this is?"
    
    
      "Yes, my lord, it belongs to the young Duke of Champdoce."
    
    
      "Of course," answered Diana, "I have often seen the dog at the Widow
      Rouleau's, and have occasionally given it a piece of bread. He was always
      with Francoise, who ran off with that man Daumon. Oh, yes, I know him now;
      here, Bruno, here!"
    
    
      The dog rushed to her, and, stooping down, she caressed him, thus hoping
      to conceal her tell-tale face.
    
    
      Octave drew his wife's arm within his without another word. A strange
      feeling of doubt had arisen in his mind. Diana, too, was much disturbed,
      and abused herself mentally for having been so weak and cowardly. Why had
      she not at once confessed that she knew the dog? Had she said at once,
      "Why, that is Bruno, the Duke of Champdoce's dog," her husband would have
      thought no more about the matter; but her own folly had made much of a
      merely trivial incident.
    
    
      Ever since that fatal walk the Viscount's manner appeared to have changed,
      and more than once Diana fancied that she caught a look of suspicion in
      his eyes. How could she best manage to make him forget this unlucky event?
      She saw that for the rest of her life she must affect a terror of dogs;
      and, for the future, whenever she saw one, she uttered a little cry of
      alarm, and insisted upon all Octave's being chained up. But for all this
      she lived in a perfect atmosphere of suspicion and anxiety, while the very
      ground upon which she walked seemed to have been mined beneath her feet.
      Her sole wish now was to fly from Mussidan, and leave Bevron and its
      environs, she cared not for what spot. It has been first arranged that
      immediately after the marriage they should make a short tour; but in spite
      of this, they still lingered at Mussidan; and all that Diana could do was
      to keep this previous determination before her husband, without making any
      direct attack.
    
    
      The blow came at last, and was more unexpected and terrible than she had
      anticipated. On the afternoon of the 26th of October, as Diana was gazing
      from her window, an excited crowd rushed into the courtyard of the
      Chateau, followed by four men bearing a litter covered with a sheet, under
      which could be distinguished the rigid limbs of a dead body, while a cruel
      crimson stain upon one side of the white covering too plainly showed that
      some one had met with a violent death.
    
    
      The hideous sight froze Diana with terror, and it was impossible for her
      to leave the window or quit the object on the litter, which seemed to have
      a terrible fascination for her. That very morning her husband, accompanied
      by his friend the Baron de Clinchain, Montlouis, and a servant named
      Ludovic, had gone out for a day's shooting. It was evident that something
      had happened to one of the party; which of them could it be? The doubt was
      not of very long duration; for at that moment her husband entered the
      courtyard, supported by M. de Clinchain and Ludovic. His face was deadly
      pale, and he seemed scarcely able to drag one leg after the other. The
      dead man therefore must be Montlouis. She need no longer plot and scheme
      for the dismissal of the secretary, for his tongue had been silenced for
      ever.
    
    
      A ray of comfort dawned in Diana's heart at this idea, and gave her the
      strength to descend the staircase. Halfway down she met M. de Clinchain,
      who was ascending. He seized her by the arm, and said hoarsely,       
    
    
      "Go back, madame, go back!"
    
    
      "But tell me what has happened."
    
    
      "A terrible calamity. Go back to your room, I beg of you. Your husband
      will be here presently;" and, as Octave appeared, he absolutely pushed her
      into her own room.
    
    
      Octave followed, and, extending his arms, pressed his wife closely to his
      breast, bursting as he did so into a passion of sobs.
    
    
      "Ah!" cried M. de Clinchain joyously, "he is saved. See, he weeps; I had
      feared for his reason."
    
    
      After many questions and incoherent answers, Madame de Mussidan at last
      arrived at the fact that her husband had shot Montlouis by accident. Diana
      believed this story, but it was far from the truth. Montlouis had met his
      death at her hands quite as much as the Duke de Champdoce had done. He had
      died because he was the possessor of a fatal secret.
    
    
      This was what had really occurred. After lunch, Octave, who had drunk
      rather freely, began to rally Montlouis regarding his mysterious
      movements, and to assert that some woman must be at the bottom of them. At
      first Montlouis joined in the laugh; but at length M. de Mussidan became
      too personal in remarks regarding the woman his secretary loved, and
      Montlouis responded angrily. This influenced his master's temper, and he
      went on to say that he could no longer permit such doings, and he
      reproached his secretary for risking his present and future for a woman
      who was worthy neither of love nor respect, and who was notoriously
      unfaithful to him. Montlouis heard this last taunt with compressed lips
      and a deep cloud upon his brow.
    
    
      "Do not utter a word more, Count," said he; "I forbid you to do so."
    
    
      He spoke so disrespectfully that Octave was about to strike him, but
      Montlouis drew back and avoided the blow; but he was so intoxicated with
      fury that this last insult roused him beyond all bounds.
    
    
      "By what right do you speak thus," said he, "who have married another
      man's mistress? It well becomes you to talk of woman's virtue, when your
      wife is a       "
    
    
      He had no time to finish his sentence, for Octave, levelling his gun, shot
      him through the heart.
    
    
      M. de Mussidan kept these facts from his wife because he really loved her,
      and true love is capable of any extreme; and he felt that, however strong
      the cause might be, he should never have the courage to separate from
      Diana; that whatever she might do in the future, or had already done in
      the past, he could not choose but forgive her.
    
    
      Acquitted of all blame, thanks to Clinchain's and Ludovic's evidence       for
      they had mutually agreed that the tragical occurrence should be
      represented to have been the result of an accident       the conscience of
      M. de Mussidan left him but little peace. The girl whom Montlouis had
      loved had been driven from her home in disgrace, owing to having given
      birth to a son. Octave sought her out, and, without giving any reason for
      his generosity, told her that her son, whom she had named Paul, after his
      father, Montlouis, should never come to want.
    
    
      Shortly after this sad occurrence, M. de Mussidan and his wife quitted
      Poitiers, for Diana had more than once determined that she would make
      Paris her residence for the future. She had taken into her service a woman
      who had been in the service of Marie de Puymandour, and through her had
      discovered that, previous to her marriage with Norbert, Marie had loved
      George de Croisenois; and she intended to use this knowledge at some
      future date as a weapon with which to deal the Duke de Champdoce a deadly
      blow.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XIII.
    
    
      A SCHEME OF VENGEANCE.
    
    
      The marriage between Norbert and Mademoiselle de Puymandour was entirely
      deficient in that brief, ephemeral light that shines over the honeymoon.
      The icy wall that stood between them became each day stronger and taller.
      There was no one to smooth away inequalities, no one to exercise a kindly
      influence over two characters, both haughty and determined. After his
      father's death, when Norbert announced his intention of residing in Paris,
      M. de Puymandour highly approved of this resolution, for he fancied that
      if he were to remain alone in the country, he could to a certain extent
      take the place and position of the late Duke, and, with the permission of
      his son-in-law, at once take up his residence at Champdoce.
    
    
      Almost as soon as the young Duchess arrived in Paris she realized the fact
      that she was the most unfortunate woman in the world. As Champdoce was
      almost like her own home, her eyes lighted on familiar scenes; and if she
      went out, she was sure of being greeted by kindly words and friendly
      features; but in Paris she only found solitude, for everything there was
      strange and hostile. The late Duke, pinching and parsimonious as he had
      been towards himself and his son, launched out into the wildest
      extravagances when he imagined he was working for his coming race, and the
      home which he had prepared for his great-grandchildren was the incarnation
      of splendor and luxury.
    
    
      Upon the arrival of Norbert and his wife, they could almost fancy that
      they had only quitted their town house a few days before, so perfect were
      all the arrangements. Had Norbert been left to act for himself, he might
      have felt a little embarrassed, but his trusty servant Jean aided him with
      his advice, and the establishment was kept on a footing to do honor to the
      traditions of the house of Champdoce. Everything can be procured in Paris
      for money, and Jean had filled the ante-rooms with lackeys, the kitchens
      and offices with cooks and scullions, and the stables with grooms,
      coachmen, and horses, while every description of carriage stood in the
      place appointed for their reception.
    
    
      But all this bustle and excitement did not seem in the eyes of the young
      Duchess to impart life to the house. It appeared to her dead and empty as
      a sepulchre. It seemed as if she were living beneath the weight of some
      vague and indefinable terror, some hideous and hidden spectre which might
      at any moment start from its hiding place and drive her mad with the alarm
      it excited. She had not a soul in whom she could confide. She had been
      forbidden by Norbert to renew her acquaintance with her old Parisian
      friends, for Norbert did not consider them of sufficiently good family,
      and in addition he had used the pretext of the deep mourning they were in
      to put off receiving visitors for a twelvemonth at least. She felt herself
      alone and solitary, and, in this frame of mind, how was it possible for
      her not to let her thoughts wander once again to George de Croisenois. Had
      her father been willing, she might have been his wife now, and have been
      wandering hand in hand in some sequestered spot beneath the clear blue sky
      of Italy. He had loved her, while Norbert              .
    
    
      Norbert was leading one of those mad, headstrong lives which have but two
      conclusions       ruin or suicide. His name had been put up for election
      at a fashionable club by his uncle, the Chevalier de Septraor, as soon as
      he arrived in Paris. He had been elected at once, being looked on as a
      decided acquisition to the list of members. He bore one of the oldest
      names to be found among the French nobility, while his fortune       gigantic
      as it was       had been magnified threefold by the tongue of common
      report. He was received with open arms everywhere, and lived in a perfect
      atmosphere of flattery. Not being able to shine by means of cultivation or
      polish, he sought to gain a position in his club by a certain roughness of
      demeanor and a cynical mode of speech. He flung away his money in every
      direction, kept racers, and was uniformly fortunate in his betting
      transactions. He frequented the world of gallantry, and was constantly to
      be seen in the company of women whose reputations were exceedingly
      equivocal. His days were spent on horseback, or in the fencing room, and
      his nights in drinking, gambling, and all kinds of debauchery. His wife
      scarcely ever saw him, for when he returned home it was usually with the
      first beams of day, either half intoxicated or savage from having lost
      large sums at the gambling table. Jean, the old and trusty retainer of the
      house of Champdoce, was deeply grieved, not so much at seeing his master
      so rapidly pursuing the path to ruin as at the fact that he was ever
      surrounded by dissolute and disreputable acquaintances.
    
    
      "Think of your name," he would urge; "of the honor of your name."
    
    
      "And what does that matter," sneered Norbert, "provided that I live a
      jolly life, and shuffle out of the world rapidly?"
    
    
      There was one fixed star in all the dark clouds that surrounded him, which
      now seemed to blaze brightly, and this star was Diana de Mussidan. Do what
      he would, it was impossible to efface her image from his memory. Even
      amidst the fumes of wine and the debauched revelry of the supper table he
      could see the form that he had once so passionately loved standing out
      like a pillar of light, clear and distinct against the darkness. He had
      led this demoralizing existence for fully six months, when one day, as he
      was riding down the Avenue des Champs Elysees, he saw a lady give him a
      friendly bow. She was seated in a magnificent open carriage, wrapped in
      the richest and most costly furs. Thinking that she might be one of the
      many actresses with whom he was acquainted, Norbert turned his horse's
      head towards the carriage; but as he got nearer he saw, to his extreme
      amazement and almost terror, that it was Diana de Mussidan who was seated
      in it. He did not turn back, however; and as the carriage had just drawn
      up, he reined in his horse alongside of it. Diana was as much agitated as
      he was, and for a moment neither of them spoke, but their eyes were firmly
      fixed upon each other, and they sat pale and breathless, as if each had
      some sad presentiment which fate was preparing for them both. At last
      Norbert felt that he must break the silence, for the servants were
      beginning to gaze upon them with eyes full of curiosity.
    
    
      "What, madame, you here, in Paris?" said he with an effort.
    
    
      She had drawn out a slender hand from the mass of furs in which she was
      enveloped, and extended it to him, as she replied in a tone which had a
      ring of tenderness beneath its commonplace tone,       
    
    
      "Yes, we are established here, and I hope that we shall be as good friends
      as we were once before. Farewell, until we meet again."
    
    
      As if her words had been a signal, the coachman struck his horses lightly
      with his whip, and the magnificent equipage rolled swiftly away. Norbert
      had not accepted Diana's proffered hand, but presently he realized the
      whole scene, and plunging his spurs into his horse dashed furiously up the
      Avenue in the direction of the Arc de Triomphe.
    
    
      "Ah!" said he, as a bitter pang of despair shot through his heart, "I
      still love her, and can never care for any one else; but I will see her
      again. She has not forgotten me. I could read it in her eyes, and detect
      it all in the tones of her voice." Here a momentary gleam of reason
      crossed his brain. "But will a woman like Diana ever forgive an offence
      like mine? and when she seems most friendly the danger is the more near."
    
    
      Unfortunately he thrust aside this idea, and refused to listen to the
      voice of reason. That evening he went down to his club with the intention
      of asking a few questions regarding the Mussidans. He heard enough to
      satisfy himself, and the next day he met Madame de Mussidan in the Champs
      Elysees, and for many days afterwards in rapid succession. Each day they
      exchanged a few words, and at last Diana, with much simulated hesitation,
      promised to alight from her carriage when next they met in the Bois, and
      talk to Norbert unhampered by the presence of the domestics.
    
    
      Madame de Mussidan had made the appointment for three o'clock, but before
      two Norbert was on the spot, in a fever of expectation and doubt.
    
    
      "Is it I," asked he of himself, "waiting once more for Diana, as I have so
      often waited for her at Bevron?"
    
    
      Ah, how many changes had taken place since then! He was now no longer
      waiting for Diana de Laurebourg, but for the Countess de Mussidan, another
      man's wife, while he also was a married man. It was no longer the whim of
      a monomaniac that kept them apart, but the dictates of law, honor, and the
      world.
    
    
      "Why," said he, in a mad burst of passion, "why should we not set at
      defiance all the cold social rules framed by an artificial state of
      society; why should not the woman leave her husband and the man his wife?"
      Norbert had consulted his watch times without number before the appointed
      hour came. "Ah," sighed he, "suppose that she should not come after all."
    
    
      As he said these words a cab stopped, and the Countess de Mussidan
      alighted from it. She came rapidly along towards him, crossing an open
      space without heeding the irregularities of the ground, as that diminished
      the distance which separated her from Norbert. He advanced to meet her,
      and taking his arm, they plunged into the recesses of the Bois. There had
      been heavy rain on the day previous, and the pathway was wet and muddy,
      but Madame de Mussidan did not seem to notice this.
    
    
      "Let us go on," said she, "until we are certain of not being seen from the
      road. I have taken every precaution. My carriage and servants are waiting
      for me in front of St. Philippe du Roule; but for all that I may have been
      watched."
    
    
      "You were not so timid in bygone days."
    
    
      "Then I was my own mistress; and if I lost my reputation, the loss
      affected me only; but on my wedding day I had a sacred trust confided to
      me       the honor of the man who has given me his name, and that I must
      guard with jealous care."
    
    
      "Then you love me no longer."
    
    
      She stopped suddenly, and overwhelming Norbert with one of those glacial
      glances which she knew so well how to assume, answered in measured
      accents,       
    
    
      "Your memory fails you; all that has remained to me of the past is the
      rejection of a proposal conveyed in a certain letter that I wrote."
    
    
      Norbert interrupted her by a piteous gesture of entreaty.
    
    
      "Mercy!" said he. "You would pardon me if you knew all the horrors of the
      punishment that I am enduring. I was mad, blind, besotted, nor did I love
      you as I do at this moment."
    
    
      A smile played round Diana's beautiful mouth, for Norbert had told her
      nothing that she did not know before, but she wished to hear it from his
      own lips.
    
    
      "Alas!" murmured she; "I can only frame my reply with the fatal words, 'Too
      late!'"
    
    
      "Diana!"
    
    
      He endeavored to seize her hand, but she drew it away with a rapid
      movement.
    
    
      "Do not use that name," said she; "you have no right to do so. Is it not
      sufficient to have blighted the young girl's life? and yet you seek to
      compromise the honor of the wife. You must forget me; do you understand?
      It is to tell you this that I am here. The other day, when I saw you
      again, I lost my self-command. My heart leapt up at the sight of you, and,
      fool that I was, I permitted you to see this; but base no hopes on my
      weakness. I said to you, Let us be friends. It was a mere act of madness.
      We can never be friends, and had better, therefore, treat each other as
      strangers. Do you forget that lying tongues at Bevron accused me of being
      your mistress? Do you think that this falsehood has not reached my
      husband's ears? One day, when your name was mentioned in his presence, I
      saw a gleam of hatred and jealousy in his eye. Great heavens! should he,
      on my return, suspect that my hand had rested in yours, he would expel me
      from his house like some guilty wretch! The door of our house must remain
      for ever closed to you. I am miserable indeed. Be a man; and if your heart
      still holds one atom of the love you once bore for me, prove it by never
      seeking me again."
    
    
      As she concluded she hurried away, leaving in Norbert's heart a more
      deadly poison than the one she had endeavored to persuade the son to
      administer to his father, the Duke de Champdoce. She knew each chord that
      vibrated in his heart, and could play on it at will. She felt sure that in
      a month he would again be her slave, and that she could exercise over him
      a sway more despotic than she had yet done, and, in addition to this, that
      he would assist her in executing a cruel scheme of revenge, which she had
      long been plotting.
    
    
      After having followed Diana about like her very shadow for several days,
      Norbert at last ventured to approach her in the Champs Elysees. She was
      angry, but not to such an extent that he feared to repeat his offence.
      Then she wept, but her tears could not force him to avoid her. At first
      her system of defence was very strong, then it gradually grew weaker. She
      granted him another interview, and then two others followed. But what were
      these meetings worth to him? They took place in a church or a public
      gallery, in places where they could scarcely exchange a grasp of the hand.
      At length she told him that she had thought of a place which would render
      their interviews less perilous, but that she hardly dared tell him where
      it was. He pressed her to tell him, and, by degrees, she permitted herself
      to be persuaded. Her idea was to become the friend of the Duchess of
      Champdoce.
    
    
      Norbert now felt that she was more an angel than a woman, and it was
      agreed that on the next day he himself would introduce her to his wife.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XIV.
    
    
      FALSE FRIEND, OLD LOVER.
    
    
      It was on a Wednesday morning that the Duke de Champdoce, instead of, as
      usual, going to his own or one of his friends' clubs to breakfast, took
      his seat at the table where his wife was partaking of her morning meal. He
      was in excellent spirits, gay, and full of pleasant talk, a mood in which
      his wife had never seen him since their ill-fated marriage. The Duchess
      could not understand this sudden change in her husband; it terrified and
      alarmed her, for she felt that it was the forerunner of some serious
      event, which would change the current of her life entirely.
    
    
      Norbert waited until the domestics had completed their duty and retired,
      and as soon as he was alone with his wife he took her hand and kissed it
      with an air of gallantry.
    
    
      "It has been a long time, my dear Marie, since I had resolved to open my
      heart to you entirely, and now a full and open explanation has become
      absolutely necessary."
    
    
      "An explanation!" faltered Marie.
    
    
      "Yes, certainly; but do not let the word alarm you. I fear that I must
      have appeared in your eyes the most morose and disagreeable of husbands.
      Permit me to explain. Since we came here, I have gone about my own
      affairs, I have gone out early and returned extremely late, and sometimes
      three days have elapsed without our even setting eyes on each other."
    
    
      The young Duchess listened to him like a woman who could not believe her
      ears. Could this be her husband who was heaping reproaches upon himself in
      this manner?
    
    
      "I have made no complaint," stammered she.
    
    
      "I know that, Marie; you have a noble and forgiving nature; but, however,
      it is impossible, as a woman, that you should not have condemned me."
    
    
      "Indeed, but I have not done so."
    
    
      "So much the better for me. On this I shall not have to find either
      defence or excuse for my conduct; you must know, however, that you are
      ever foremost in my thoughts, even when I am away from you."
    
    
      He was evidently doing his best to put on an air of tenderness and
      affection, but he failed; for though his words were kind, the tone of his
      voice was neither tender nor sympathetic.
    
    
      "I hope I know my duty," said the Duchess.
    
    
      "Pray, Marie," broke in he, "do not let the word duty be uttered between
      us. You know that you have been much alone, because it was impossible for
      the friends of Mademoiselle de Puymandour to be those of the Duchess de
      Champdoce!"
    
    
      "Have I made any opposition to your orders?"
    
    
      "Then, too, our mourning prevents us going out into the world for five
      months longer at least."
    
    
      "Have I asked to go out?"
    
    
      "All the more reason that I should endeavor to make your home less dull
      for you. I should like you to have with you some person in whose society
      you could find pleasure and distraction. Not one of those foolish girls
      who have no thought save for balls and dress, but a sensible woman of the
      world, and, above all, one of your own age and rank,       a woman, in
      short, of whom you could make a friend. But where can such a one be found?
      It is a perilous quest to venture on, and upon such a friend often depends
      the happiness and misery of a home.
    
    
      "But," continued he, after a brief pause, "I think that I have discovered
      the very one that will suit you. I met her at the house of Madame
      d'Ailange, who spoke eloquently of her charms of mind and body, and I hope
      to have the pleasure of presenting her to you to-day."
    
    
      "Here, at our house?"
    
    
      "Certainly; there is nothing odd in this. Besides, the lady is no stranger
      to us; she comes from our own part of the country, and you know her."
    
    
      A flush came over his face, and he busied himself with the fire to conceal
      it as he added,       
    
    
      "You recollect Mademoiselle de Laurebourg?"
    
    
      "Do you mean Diana de Laurebourg?"
    
    
      "Exactly so."
    
    
      "I saw very little of her, for my father and hers did not get on very well
      together. The Marquis de Laurebourg looked on us as too insignificant to       "
    
    
      "Ah, well," interrupted he, "I trust that the daughter will make up for
      the father's shortcomings. She married just after our wedding had been
      celebrated, and her husband is the Count de Mussidan. She will call on you
      to-day, and I have told your servants to say that you are at home."
    
    
      The silence that followed this speech lasted for nearly a couple of
      minutes, and became exceedingly embarrassing, when suddenly the sound of
      wheels was heard on the gravel of the courtyard, and in a moment
      afterwards a servant came and announced that the Countess de Mussidan was
      in the drawing-room. Norbert rose, and, taking his wife's arm, led her
      away.
    
    
      "Come, Marie, come," said he; "she has arrived."
    
    
      Diana had reflected deeply before she had taken this extraordinarily bold
      step. In paying a visit so contrary to all the usual rules of etiquette,
      she exposed herself to the chance of receiving a severe rebuff. The few
      seconds that elapsed while she was still alone in the drawing-room seemed
      like so many centuries; but the door was opened, and Norbert and his wife
      appeared. Then, with a charming smile, Madame de Mussidan rose and bowed
      gracefully to the Duchess de Champdoce, making a series of half-jesting
      apologies for her intrusion. She had been utterly unable, she said, to
      resist the pleasure she should experience in seeing an old country
      neighbor, the more so as they were now separated by so short a distance.
      She had, therefore, disregarded all the rules of etiquette so that they
      might have a cozy chat about Poitiers, Bevron, Champdoce, and all the
      country where she had been born, and which she so dearly loved.
    
    
      The Duchess listened in silence to this torrent of words, and the
      expression of her face showed how surprised she was at this unexpected
      visit. A less perfectly self-possessed woman than Diana de Mussidan might
      have felt abashed, but the slight annoyance was not to be compared to the
      prospective advantages that she hoped to gain, and she brought all the
      mettle of her talent and diplomacy into play.
    
    
      Norbert was moving about the room, half ashamed of the ignoble part that
      he was playing. As soon as he thought that the welcome between the two
      ladies had been partially got over, and imagined that they were conversing
      more amicably together, he slipped out of the room, not knowing whether to
      be pleased or angry at the success of the trick.
    
    
      The trick was rather a more difficult one than Diana had, from Norbert's
      account, anticipated, as she had thought that she would have been received
      by the Duchess like some ministering angel sent down to earth to console
      an unhappy captive. She had expected to find a simple, guileless woman,
      who, upon her first visit, would throw her arms round her visitor's neck
      and yield herself entirely to her influence. Far, however, from being
      dismayed, Diana was rather pleased at this unexpected difficulty, and so
      fully exerted all her powers of fascination, that when she took her leave,
      she believed that she had made a little progress.
    
    
      On that very evening the Duchess remarked to her husband,       
    
    
      "I think that I shall like Madame de Mussidan; she seems an excellent kind
      of woman."
    
    
      "Excellent is just the proper word," returned Norbert. "All Bevron was in
      tears when she was married and had to leave, for she was a real angel
      among the poor."
    
    
      Norbert was intensely gratified by Diana's success; for was it not for him
      that she had displayed all her skill, and was not this a proof that she
      still cherished a passion for him?
    
    
      He was not, however, quite so much pleased when he met Madame de Mussidan
      the next day in the Champs Elysees. She looked sad and thoughtful.
    
    
      "What has gone wrong?" asked he.
    
    
      "I am very angry with myself for having listened to the voice of my own
      heart and to your entreaties," answered she, "and I think that both of us
      have committed a grave error."
    
    
      "Indeed, and what have we done?"
    
    
      "Norbert, your wife suspects something."
    
    
      "Impossible! Why, she was praising you after you had left."
    
    
      "If that is the case, then she is indeed a much more clever woman than I
      had imagined, for she knows how to conceal her suspicions until she is in
      a position to prove them."
    
    
      Diana spoke with such a serious air of conviction, that Norbert became
      quite alarmed.
    
    
      "What shall we do?" asked he.
    
    
      "The best thing would be to give up meeting each other, I think."
    
    
      "Never; I tell you, never!"
    
    
      "Let me reflect; in the meantime be prudent; for both our sakes, be
      prudent."
    
    
      To further his ends, Norbert entirely changed his mode of life. He gave up
      going to his clubs, refused invitations to fast suppers, and no longer
      spent his nights in gambling and drinking. He drove out with his wife, and
      frequently spent his evenings with her, and at the club began to be looked
      on as quite a model husband. This great change, however, was not effected
      without many a severe inward struggle. He felt deeply humiliated at the
      life of deception that he was forced to lead, but Diana's hand, apparently
      so slight and frail, held him with a grip of steel.
    
    
      "We must live in this way," said she, in answer to his expostulations,
      "first, because it must be so; and, secondly, because it is my will. On
      our present mode of conduct depends all our future safety, and I wish the
      Duchess to believe that with me happiness and content must have come to
      her fireside."
    
    
      Norbert could not gainsay this very reasonable proposition on the part of
      Madame de Mussidan, for he was more in love than ever, and the terrible
      fear that if he went in any way contrary to her wishes that she would
      refuse to see him any more, stayed the words of objection that rose to his
      lips.
    
    
      After hesitating for a little longer, the Duchess made up her mind to
      accept the offer of friendship which Diana had so ingenuously offered to
      her, and finished by giving herself up to the bitterest enemy that she had
      in the world. By degrees she had no secrets from her new friend, and one
      day, after a long and confidential conversation, she acknowledged to Diana
      the whole secret of the early love of her girlish days, the memory of
      which had never faded from the inmost recesses of her heart, and was rash
      enough to mention George de Croisenois by name. Madame de Mussidan was
      overjoyed at what she considered so signal a victory.
    
    
      "Now I have her," thought she, "and vengeance is within my grasp."
    
    
      Marie and Diana were now like two sisters, and were almost constantly
      together; but this intimacy had not given to Norbert the facile means of
      meeting Diana which he had so ardently hoped for. Though Madame de
      Mussidan visited his house nearly every day, he absolutely saw less of her
      than he had done before, and sometimes weeks elapsed without his catching
      a glimpse of her face. She played her game with such consummate skill,
      that Marie was always placed as a barrier between Norbert and herself, as
      in the farce, when the lover wishes to embrace his mistress, he finds the
      wrinkled visage of the duenna offered to his lips. Sometimes he grew
      angry, but Diana always had some excellent reason with which to close his
      mouth. Sometimes she held up his pretensions to ridicule, and at others
      assumed a haughty air, which always quelled incipient rebellion upon his
      part.
    
    
      "What did you expect of me?" she would say, "and of what base act did you
      do me the honor to consider me capable?"
    
    
      He was treated exactly like a child, or more cruel still, like a person
      deficient in intellect, and this he was thoroughly aware of. He could not
      meet Madame de Mussidan as he had formerly done, for now in the Bois, at
      Longchamps, or at any place of public amusement she was invariably
      surrounded by a band of fashionable admirers, among whom George de
      Croisenois was always to be found. Norbert disliked all these men, but he
      had a special antipathy to George de Croisenois, whom he regarded as a
      supercilious fool; but in this opinion he was entirely wrong, for the
      Marquis de Croisenois was looked upon as one of the most talented and
      witty men in Parisian society, and in this case the opinion of the world
      was a well-founded one. Many men envied him, but he had no enemies, and
      his honest and straightforward conduct was beyond all doubt. He had the
      noble instincts of a knight of the days of chivalry.
    
    
      "Pray," asked Norbert, "what is it that you can see in this sneering dandy
      who is always hanging about you?"
    
    
      But Diana, with a meaning smile, always made the same reply,       
    
    
      "You ask too much; but some time you will learn all."
    
    
      Every day she contrived, when with the Duchess, to turn the conversation
      skilfully upon George de Croisenois, and she had in a manner accustomed
      Marie to look certain possibilities straight in the face, from the very
      idea of which she would a few months back have recoiled with horror. This
      point once gained, Madame de Mussidan believed that the moment had arrived
      to bring the former lovers together again, and fancied that one sudden and
      unexpected encounter would advance matters much more quickly than all her
      half-veiled insinuations. One day, therefore, when the Duchess had called
      on her friend, on entering the drawing-room, she found it only tenanted by
      George de Croisenois. An exclamation of astonishment fell from the lips of
      both as their eyes met; the cheek of each grew pale. The Duchess, overcome
      by her feelings, sank half-fainting into a chair near the door.
    
    
      "Ah," murmured he, scarcely knowing the meaning of the words he uttered,
      "I had every confidence in you, and you have forgotten me."
    
    
      "You do not believe the words you have just spoken," returned the Duchess
      haughtily; "but," she added in softer accents, "what could I do? I may
      have been weak in obeying my father, but for all that I have never
      forgotten the past."
    
    
      Madame de Mussidan, who had stationed herself behind the closed door,
      caught every word, and a gleam of diabolical triumph flashed from her
      eyes. She felt sure that an interview which began in this manner would be
      certain to be repeated, and she was not in error. She soon saw that by
      some tacit understanding the Duchess and George contrived to meet
      constantly at her house, and this she carefully abstained from noticing.
      Things were working exactly as she desired and she waited, for she could
      well afford to do so, knowing that the impending crash could not long be
      delayed.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XV.
    
    
      A STAB IN THE DARK.
    
    
      September had now arrived; and though the weather was very bad, the Duke
      de Champdoce, accompanied by his faithful old servant, Jean, left Paris on
      a visit to his training stables. Having had a serious difference with
      Diana, he had made up his mind to try whether a long absence on his part
      would not have the effect of reducing her to submission, and at the same
      time remembering the proverb, that "absence makes the heart grow fonder."
    
    
      He had already been away two whole days, and was growing extremely anxious
      at not having heard from Madame de Mussidan, when one evening, as he was
      returning from a late inspection of his stud, he was informed that there
      was a man waiting to see him. The man was a poor old fellow belonging to
      the place, who eked out a wretched subsistence by begging, and executing
      occasional commissions.
    
    
      "Do you want me?" asked the Duke.
    
    
      With a sly look, the man drew from his pocket a letter.
    
    
      "This is for you," muttered he.
    
    
      "All right; give it to me, then."
    
    
      "I was told to give it to you only in private."
    
    
      "Never mind that; hand it over."
    
    
      "Well, if I must, I must."
    
    
      Norbert's sole thought was that this letter must have come from Diana, and
      throwing the man a coin, hurried to a spot where it was light enough to
      read the missive. He did not, however, recognize Diana's firm, bold hand
      on the envelope.
    
    
      "Who the devil can this be from?" thought Norbert, as he tore open the
      outer covering. The paper within was soiled and greasy, and the
      handwriting was of the vilest description, it was full of bad spelling,
      and ran thus:       
    
    
      "Sir,       
    
    
      "I hardly dare tell you the truth, and yet my conscience will give me no
      relief until I do so. I can no longer bear to see a gentleman such as you
      are deceived by a woman who has no heart or honorable feeling. Your wife
      is unfaithful to you, and will soon make you a laughing stock to all. You
      may trust to this being true, for I am a respectable woman, and you can
      easily find out if I am lying to you. Hide yourself this evening, so that
      you may command a view of the side-door in the wall of your garden, and
      between half-past ten and eleven you will see your wife's lover enter. It
      is a long time since he has been furnished with a key. The hour for the
      meeting has been judiciously fixed, for all the servants will be out; but
      I implore you not to be violent, for I would not do your wife any harm,
      but I feel that you ought to be warned.
    
    
      "From one
    
    
      "WHO KNOWS."
    
    
      Norbert ran through the contents of this infamous anonymous letter in an
      instant. The blood surged madly through his brain, and he uttered a howl
      of fury. His servants ran in to see what was the matter.
    
    
      "Where is the fellow who brought this letter?" said he. "Run after him and
      bring him back to me."
    
    
      In a few minutes the sturdy grooms made their appearance, pushing in the
      messenger, who seemed over-powered with tears.
    
    
      "I am not a thief," exclaimed he. "It was given to me, but I will give it
      back."
    
    
      He was alluding to the louis given to him by Norbert, for the largeness of
      the sum made him think that the donor had made a mistake.
    
    
      "Keep the money," said the Duke; "I meant it for you; but tell me who gave
      this letter to you."
    
    
      "I can't tell you," answered the man. "If I ever saw him before, may my
      next glass of wine choke me. He got out of a cab just as I was passing
      near the bridge, and calling to me, said, 'Look at this letter; at
      half-past seven take it to the Duke de Champdoce, who lives by his stables
      in the road to the Forest. Do you know the place?' 'Yes,' I says, and then
      he slips the letter and a five-franc piece into my hand, got back into the
      cab, and off he went."
    
    
      "What was the man like?" asked he.
    
    
      "Well, I can hardly say. He wasn't young or old, or short or tall. I
      recollect he had a gold watch-chain on, but that was about all I noticed."
    
    
      "Very well; you can be off."
    
    
      At this moment Norbert's anger was turned against the writer of the letter
      only, for he did not place the smallest credence in the accusations
      against his wife. If he did not love her, he at any rate respected her.
      "My wife," said he to himself, "is an honorable and virtuous woman, and it
      is some discharged menial who has taken this cowardly mode of revenge." A
      closer inspection of the letter seemed to show him that the faults in
      caligraphy were intentional. The concluding portion of the letter excited
      his attention, and, calling Jean, he asked him if it was true that all the
      servants would be absent from the house to-day.
    
    
      "There will be none there this evening; not until late at night," answered
      the old man.
    
    
      "And why, pray?"
    
    
      "Have you forgotten, your Grace, that the first coachman is going to be
      married, and the Duchess was good enough to say that all might go to the
      wedding dinner and ball, as long as some one remained at the porter's
      lodge?"
    
    
      After the first outburst, Norbert affected an air of calmness, and laughed
      at the idea of having permitted himself to be disturbed for so trivial a
      cause. But this was mere pretence, for doubt and suspicion had entered his
      soul, and no power on earth could expel them. "Why should not my wife be
      unfaithful to me?" thought Norbert. "I give her credit for being honorable
      and right-minded, but then all deceived husbands have the same idea. Why
      should I not take advantage of this information, and judge for myself? But
      no. I will not stoop to such an act of baseness. I should be as infamous
      as the writer of this letter if I was to play the spy, as she recommends
      me to do." He glanced round, and perceived that his servants were looking
      at him with undisguised curiosity.
    
    
      "Go to your work," said he. "Extinguish the lights, and see that all the
      doors and windows are carefully closed."
    
    
      He had made up his mind now, and taking out his watch, saw that it was
      just eight o'clock. "I have time to reach Paris," muttered he, "by the
      appointed time." Then he called Jean to him again. There was no need to
      conceal anything from this trusty adherent of the house of Champdoce. "I
      must start for Paris," said the Duke, "without an instant's delay."
    
    
      "On account of that letter?" asked the old man with an expression of the
      deepest sorrow upon his features.
    
    
      "Yes, for that reason only."
    
    
      "Some one has been making false charges against the Duchess."
    
    
      "How do you know that?"
    
    
      "It was easy enough to guess."
    
    
      "Have the carriage got ready, and tell the coachman to wait for me in
      front of the club. I myself will go on foot."
    
    
      "You must not do that," answered Jean gravely. "The servants may have
      conceived the same suspicions as I have. You ought to creep away without
      any one being a bit the wiser. The other domestics need not even suppose
      that you have left the house. I can get you a horse out of the little
      stables without any one being the wiser. I will wait for you on the other
      side of the bridge."
    
    
      "Good; but remember that I have not a moment to lose."
    
    
      Jean left the room, and as he reached the passage Norbert heard him say to
      one of the servants, "Put some cold supper on the table; the Duke says
      that he is starving."
    
    
      Norbert went into his bedroom, put on a great coat and a pair of high
      boots, and slipped into his pocket a revolver, the charges of which he had
      examined with the greatest care. The night was exceedingly dark, a fine,
      icy rain was falling, and the roads were very heavy. Norbert found Jean
      with the horse at the appointed spot, and as he leaped into the saddle the
      Duke exclaimed, "Not a soul saw me leave the house."
    
    
      "Nor I either," returned the attached domestic. "I shall go back and act
      as if you were at supper. At three in the morning I will be in the
      wine-shop on the left-hand side of the road. When you return, give a
      gentle tap on the window-pane with the handle of your whip." Norbert
      sprang into the saddle, and sped away through the darkness like a phantom
      of the night. Jean had made an excellent choice in the horse he had
      brought for his master's use, and the animal made its way rapidly through
      the mud and rain; but Norbert by this time was half mad with excitement,
      and spurred him madly on. As he neared home a new idea crossed his brain.
      Suppose it was a practical joke on the part of some of the members of the
      club? In that case, they would doubtless be watching for his arrival, and,
      after talking to him on indifferent subjects, would, when he betrayed any
      symptoms of impatience, overwhelm him with ridicule. The fear of this made
      him cautious. What should he do with the horse he was riding? The
      wine-shops were open, and perhaps he might pick up some man there who
      would take charge of it for him. As he was debating this point, his eyes
      fell upon a soldier, probably on his way to barracks.
    
    
      "My man," asked the Duke, "would you like to earn twenty francs?"
    
    
      "I should think so, if it is nothing contrary to the rules and regulations
      of the army."
    
    
      "It is only to take my horse and walk him up and down while I pay a visit
      close by."
    
    
      "I can stay out of the barracks a couple of hours longer, but no more,"
      returned the soldier.
    
    
      Norbert told the soldier where he was to wait for him, and then went on
      rapidly to his own house, and reached the side street along which ran the
      garden belonging to his magnificent residence. On the opposite side of the
      street the houses all had porticoes, and Norbert took up his position in
      one of these, and peered out carefully. He had studied the whole street,
      which was not a long one, from beginning to end, and was convinced that he
      was the only person in it. He made up his mind that he would wait until
      midnight; and if by that time no one appeared, he would feel confident
      that the Duchess was innocent, and return without any one but Jean having
      known of his expedition. From his position he could see that three windows
      on the second floor of his house were lighted up, and those windows were
      in his wife's sleeping apartment. "She is the last woman in the world to
      permit a lover to visit her," thought he. "No, no; the whole thing is a
      hoax." He began to think of the way in which he had treated his wife. Had
      he nothing to reproach himself with? Ten days after their marriage he had
      deserted her entirely; and if during the last few weeks he had paid her
      any attention, it was because he was acting in obedience to the whims of
      another woman. Suppose a lover was with her now, what right had he to
      interfere? The law gave him leave, but what did his conscience say? He
      leaned against the chill stone until he almost became as cold as it was.
      It seemed to him at that moment that life and hope were rapidly drifting
      away from him. He had lost all count of how long he had been on guard. He
      pulled out his watch, but it was too dark to distinguish the hands or the
      figures on the dial-plate. A neighboring clock struck the half-hour, but
      this gave him no clue as to the time. He had almost made up his mind to
      leave, when he heard the sound of a quick step coming down the street. It
      was the light, quick step of a sportsman,       of a man more accustomed
      to the woods and fields than the pavement and asphalt of Paris. Then a
      shadow fell upon the opposite wall, and almost immediately disappeared.
      Then Norbert knew that the door had opened and closed, and that the man
      had entered the garden. There could be no doubt upon this point, and yet
      the Duke would have given worlds to be able to disbelieve the evidence of
      his senses. It might be a burglar, but burglars seldom work alone; or it
      might be a visitor to one of the servants, but all the servants were
      absent. He again raised his eyes to the windows of his wife's room. All of
      a sudden the light grew brighter; either the lamp had been turned up, or
      fresh candles lighted. Yes, it was a candle, for he saw it borne across
      the room in the direction of the great staircase, and now he saw that the
      anonymous letter had spoken the truth, and that he was on the brink of a
      discovery. A lover had entered the garden, and the lighted candle was a
      signal to him. Norbert shuddered; the blood seemed to course through his
      veins like streams of molten fire, and the misty atmosphere that
      surrounded him appeared to stifle him. He ran across the street, forced
      the lock, and rushed wildly into the garden.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XVI.
    
    
      HUSBAND AND LOVER.
    
    
      The writer of the anonymous communication had only known the secret too
      well, for the Duchess de Champdoce was awaiting a visit that evening from
      George de Croisenois; this was, however, the first time. Step by step she
      had yielded, and at length had fallen into the snare laid for her by the
      treacherous woman whom she believed to be her truest friend. The evening
      before this eventful night she had been alone in Madame de Mussidan's
      drawing-room with George de Croisenois. She had been impressed by his
      ardent passion, and had listened with pleasure to his loving entreaties.
    
    
      "I yield," said she. "Come to-morrow night, at half-past ten, to the
      little door in the garden wall; it will only be kept closed by a stone
      being placed against it inside; push it, and it will open; and when you
      have entered the garden, acquaint me with your presence by clapping yours
      hands gently once or twice."
    
    
      Diana had, from a secure hiding-place, overheard these words, and feeling
      certain that the Duchess would repent her rash promise, she kept close to
      her side until George's departure, to give her no chance of retracting her
      promise. The next day she was constantly with her victim, and made an
      excuse for dining with her, so as not to quit her until the hour for the
      meeting had almost arrived.
    
    
      It was not until she was left alone that the Duchess saw the full extent
      of her folly and rashness. She was terrified at the promise that she had
      given in a weak moment, and would have given worlds had she been able to
      retract.
    
    
      There was yet, however, one means of safety left her       she could hurry
      downstairs and secure the garden gate. She started to her feet, determined
      to execute her project; but she was too late for the appointed signal was
      heard through the chill gloom of the night. Unhappy woman! The light sound
      of George de Croisenois' palms striking one upon the other resounded in
      her ears like the dismal tolling of the funereal bell. She stooped to
      light a candle at the fire, but her hand trembled so that she could
      scarcely effect her object. She felt sure that George was still in the
      garden, though she had made no answer to his signal. She had never thought
      that he would have had the audacity to open a door that led into the house
      from the garden, but this is what he had done. In the most innocent manner
      imaginable, and so that her listener in no way suspected the special
      reason that she had for making this communication, Diana de Mussidan had
      informed George de Croisenois that upon this night all the domestics of
      the Champdoce household would be attending the coachman's wedding, and
      that consequently the mansion would be deserted. George knew also that the
      Duke was away at his training establishment, and he therefore opened the
      door, and walked boldly up the main staircase, so that when the Duchess,
      with the lighted candle in her hand, came to the top steps she found
      herself face to face with George de Croisenois, pallid with emotion and
      quivering with excitement.
    
    
      At the sight of the man she loved she started backwards with a low cry of
      anguish and despair.
    
    
      "Fly!" she said "fly, or we are lost!"
    
    
      He did not, however, seem to hear her, and the Duchess recoiled slowly,
      step by step, through the open door of her chamber, across the carpeted
      floor, until she reached the opposite wall of her room, and could go no
      farther.
    
    
      George followed her, and pushed to the door of the room as he entered it.
      This brief delay, however, had sufficed to restore Marie to the full
      possession of her senses. "If I permit him to speak," thought she,       "if
      he once suspects that my love for him is still as strong as ever, I am
      lost."
    
    
      Then she said aloud,       
    
    
      "You must leave this house, and that instantly. I was mad when I said what
      I did yesterday. You are too noble and too generous not to listen to me
      when I tell you that the moment of infatuation is over, and that all my
      reason has returned to me, and my openness will convince you of the truth
      of what I say       George de Croisenois, I love you."
    
    
      The young man uttered an exclamation of delight upon hearing this news.
    
    
      "Yes," continued Marie, "I would give half the years of my remaining life
      to be your wife. Yes, George, I love you; but the voice of duty speaks
      louder than the whispers of the heart. I may die of grief, but there will
      be no stain upon my marriage robe, no remorse eating out my heart.
      Farewell!"
    
    
      But the Marquis would not consent to this immediate dismissal, and
      appeared to be about to speak.
    
    
      "Go!" said the Duchess, with an air of command. "Leave me at once!" Then,
      as he made no effort to obey her, she went on, "If you really love me, let
      my honor be as dear to you as your own, and never try to see me again. The
      peril we are now in shows how necessary this last determination of mine
      is. I am the Duchess de Champdoce, and I will keep the name that has been
      intrusted to me pure and unsullied, nor will I stoop to treachery or
      deception."
    
    
      "Why do you use the word deception?" asked he. "I do, it is true, despise
      the woman who smiles upon the husband she is betraying, but I respect and
      honor the woman who risks all to follow the fortunes of the man she loves.
      Lay aside, Marie, name, title, fortune, and fly with me."
    
    
      "I love you too much, George," answered she gently, "to ruin your future,
      for the day would surely come when you would regret all your self-denial,
      for a woman weighed down with a sense of her dishonor is a heavy burden
      for a man to bear."
    
    
      George de Croisenois did not understand her thoroughly.
    
    
      "You do not trust me," said he. "You would be dishonored. Shall I not
      share a portion of the world's censure? And, if you wish me, I will be a
      dishonored man also. To-night I will cheat at play at the club, be
      detected, and leave the room an outcast from the society of all honorable
      men for the future. Fly with me to some distant land, and we will live
      happily under whatever name you may choose."
    
    
      "I must not listen to you," cried she wildly. "It is impossible now."
    
    
      "Impossible!       and why? Tell me, I entreat you."
    
    
      "Ah, George," sobbed she, "if you only knew              "
    
    
      He placed his arm around her waist, and was about to press his lips on
      that fair brow, when all at once he felt Marie shiver in his clasp, and,
      raising one of her arms, point towards the door, which had opened silently
      during their conversation, and upon the threshold of which stood Norbert
      de Champdoce, gloomy and threatening.
    
    
      The Marquis saw in an instant the terrible position in which his insensate
      folly had placed the woman he loved.
    
    
      "Do not come any nearer," said he, addressing Norbert; "remain where you
      are."
    
    
      A bitter laugh from the Duke made him realize the folly of his command. He
      supported the Duchess to a couch, and seated her upon it. She recovered
      consciousness almost immediately, and, as she opened her eyes, George read
      in them the most perfect forgiveness for the man who had ruined her life
      and hopes.
    
    
      This look, and the fond assurance conveyed in it, restored all George's
      coolness and self-possession, and he turned towards Norbert.
    
    
      "However compromising appearances may seem, I am the only one deserving
      punishment; the Duchess has nothing to reproach herself with in any way;
      it was without her knowledge, and without any encouragement from her, that
      I dared to enter this house, knowing as I did that the servants were all
      absent."
    
    
      Norbert, however, still maintained the same gloomy silence. He too had
      need to collect his thoughts. As he ascended the stairs he knew that he
      should find the Duchess with a lover, but he had not calculated upon that
      lover being George de Croisenois, a man whom he loathed and detested more
      than any one that he was in the habit of meeting in society. When he
      recognized George, it was with the utmost difficulty that he restrained
      himself from springing upon him and endeavoring to strangle him. He had
      suspected this man of having gained Diana's affections, and now he found
      him in the character of the lover of his wife, and he was silent simply
      because he had not yet made up his mind what he would say. If his face was
      outwardly calm and rigid as marble, while the flames of hell were raging
      in his heart, it was because his limbs for the moment refused to obey his
      will; but, in spite of this, Norbert was, for the time, literally insane.
    
    
      Croisenois folded his arms, and continued,       
    
    
      "I had only just come here at the moment of your arrival. Why were you not
      here to listen to all that passed between us? Would to heaven that you had
      been! Then you would have understood all the grandeur and nobility of your
      wife's soul. I admit the magnitude of my fault, but I am at your service,
      and am prepared to give you the satisfaction that you will doubtless
      demand."
    
    
      "From your words," answered Norbert slowly, "I presume that you allude to
      a duel; that is to say, that having effected my dishonor to-night, you
      purpose to kill me to-morrow morning. In the game that you have been
      playing a man stakes his life, and you, I think, have lost."
    
    
      Croisenois bowed. "I am a dead man," thought he as he glanced towards the
      Duchess, "and not for your sake, but on account of quite another woman."
    
    
      The sound of his own voice excited Norbert, and he went on more rapidly:
      "What need have I to risk my life in a duel? I come to my own home, I find
      you with my wife, I blow out your brains, and the law will exonerate me."
      As he said these last words, he drew a revolver from his pocket and
      levelled it at George. The moment was an intensely exciting one, but
      Croisenois did not show any sign of emotion, Norbert did not press the
      trigger, and the suspense became more than could be borne.
    
    
      "Fire!" cried George, "fire!"
    
    
      "No," returned Norbert coldly; "on reflection I have come to the
      conclusion that your dead body would be a source of extreme inconvenience
      to me."
    
    
      "You try my forbearance too far. What are your intentions?"
    
    
      "I mean to kill you," answered Norbert in such a voice of concentrated
      ferocity that George shuddered in spite of all his courage, "but it shall
      not be with a pistol shot. It is said that blood will wash out any stain,
      but it is false; for even if all yours is shed, it will not remove the
      stain from my escutcheon. One of us must vanish from the face of the earth
      in such a manner that no trace of him may remain."
    
    
      "I agree. Show me how this is to be done."
    
    
      "I know a method," answered Norbert. "If I was certain that no human being
      was aware of your presence here to-night              "
    
    
      "No one can possibly know it."
    
    
      "Then," answered the Duke, "instead of taking advantage of the rights that
      the law gives me and shooting you down on the spot, I will consent to risk
      my life against yours."
    
    
      George de Croisenois breathed a sigh of relief. "I am ready," replied he,
      "as I before told you."
    
    
      "I heard you; but remember that this will be no ordinary duel, in the
      light of day, with seconds to regulate the manner of our conduct."
    
    
      "We will fight exactly as you wish."
    
    
      "In that case, I name swords as the weapons, the garden as the spot, and
      this instant as the hour."
    
    
      The Marquis cast a glance at the window.
    
    
      "You think," observed Norbert, comprehending his look, "that the night is
      so dark that we cannot see the blades of our swords?"
    
    
      "Quite so."
    
    
      "You need not fear; there will be light enough for this death struggle of
      the one who remains in the garden, for you understand that one will
      remain."
    
    
      "I understand you; shall we go down at once?"
    
    
      Norbert shook his head in the negative.
    
    
      "You are in too great a hurry," said he, "and have not given me time to
      fix my conditions."
    
    
      "I am listening."
    
    
      "At the end of the garden there is a small plot of ground, so damp that
      nothing will grow there, and consequently is almost unfrequented; but for
      all that it is thither that you must follow me. We will each take spade
      and pick-axe, and in a very brief period we can hollow out a receptacle
      for the body of the one who falls. When this work is completed, we will
      take to our swords and fight to the death, and the one who can keep his
      feet shall finish his fallen adversary, drag his body to the hole, and
      shovel the earth over his remains."
    
    
      "Never!" exclaimed Croisenois. "Never will I agree to such barbarous
      terms."
    
    
      "Have a care then," returned Norbert; "for I shall use my rights. That
      clock points to five minutes to eleven. If, when it strikes, you have not
      decided to accept my terms, I shall fire."
    
    
      The barrel of the revolver was but a few inches from George de Croisenois'
      heart, and the finger of his most inveterate enemy was curved round the
      trigger; but his feelings had been so highly wrought up that he thought
      not of this danger. He only remembered that he had four minutes in which
      to make up his mind. The events of the last thirty minutes had pressed
      upon each other's heels with such surprising alacrity that he could hardly
      believe that they had really occurred, and it seemed to him as if it might
      not, after all, be only a hideous vision of the night.
    
    
      "You have only two minutes more," remarked the Duke.
    
    
      Croisenois started; his soul was far away from the terrible present. He
      glanced at the clock, then at his enemy, and lastly at Marie, who lay upon
      the couch, and from her ashen complexion might have been regarded as dead,
      save for the hysterical sobs which convulsed her frame. He felt that it
      was impossible to leave her in such a condition without aid of any kind,
      but he saw well that any show of pity on his part would only aggravate his
      offence. "Heaven have mercy on us!" muttered he. "We are at the mercy of a
      maniac," and with a feeling of deadly fear he asked himself what would be
      the fate of this woman, whom he loved so devotedly, were he to die. "For
      her sake," he thought, "I must slay this man, or her life will be one
      endless existence of torture       and slay him I will."
    
    
      "I accept your terms," said he aloud.
    
    
      He spoke just in time, for as the words were uttered came the whirr of the
      machinery and then the first clear stroke of the bell.
    
    
      "I thank you," answered Norbert coldly as he lowered the muzzle of his
      revolver.
    
    
      The icy frigidity of manner in a period of extreme danger, which is the
      marked characteristic of a certain type of education, had now vanished
      from the Marquis's tone and behavior.
    
    
      "But that is not all," he continued; "I, too, have certain conditions to
      propose."
    
    
      "But we agreed       "
    
    
      "Let me explain; we are going to fight in the dark in your garden without
      seconds. We are to dig a grave and the survivor is to bury his dead
      antagonist. Tell me, am I right?"
    
    
      Norbert bowed.
    
    
      "But," went on the Marquis, "how can you be certain that all will end
      here, and that the earth will be content to retain our secret? You do not
      know, and you do not seem to care, that if one day the secret will be
      disclosed and the survivor accused of being the murderer of the other,
      arrested, dragged before a tribunal, condemned, and sent to a life-long
      prison              "
    
    
      "There is a chance of that, of course."
    
    
      "And do you think that I will consent to run such a risk as that?"
    
    
      "There is such a risk, of course," answered Norbert phlegmatically; "but
      that will be an incentive for you to conceal my death as I should conceal
      yours."
    
    
      "That will not be sufficient for me," returned De Croisenois.
    
    
      "Ah! take care," sneered Norbert, "or I shall begin to think that you are
      afraid."
    
    
      "I am afraid; that is, afraid of being called a murderer."
    
    
      "That is a danger to which I am equally liable with yourself."
    
    
      Croisenois, however, was fully determined to carry his point. "You say,"
      continued he, "that our chances are equal; but if I fall, who would dream
      of searching here for my remains? You are in your own house and can take
      every precaution; but suppose, on the other hand, I kill you. Shall I look
      to the Duchess to assist me? Will not the finger of suspicion be pointed
      at her? Shall she say to her gardener when all Paris is hunting for you,
      'Mind that you do not meddle with the piece of land at the end of the
      garden.'"
    
    
      The thought of the anonymous letter crossed Norbert's mind, and he
      remembered that the writer of it must be acquainted with the coming of
      George de Croisenois. "What do you propose then?" asked he.
    
    
      "Merely that each of us, without stating the grounds of our quarrel, write
      down the conditions and sign our names as having accepted them."
    
    
      "I agree; but use dispatch."
    
    
      The two men, after the conditions had been described, wrote two letters,
      dated from a foreign country, and the survivor of the combat was to post
      his dead adversary's letter, which would not fail to stop any search after
      the vanished man. When this talk was concluded, Norbert rose to his feet.
    
    
      "One word in conclusion," said he: "a soldier is leading the horse on
      which I rode here up and down in the Place des Invalides. If you kill me,
      go and take the horse from the man, giving him the twenty francs I
      promised him."
    
    
      "I will."
    
    
      "Now let us go down."
    
    
      They left the room together. Norbert was stepping aside to permit
      Croisenois to descend the stairs first, when he felt his coat gently
      pulled, and, turning round, saw that the Duchess, too weak to rise to her
      feet, had crawled to him on her knees. The unhappy woman had heard
      everything, and in an almost inaudible voice she uttered an agonized
      prayer:
    
    
      "Mercy, Norbert! Have mercy! I swear to you that I am guiltless. You never
      loved me, why should you fight for me. Have pity! To-morrow, by all that I
      hold sacred, I swear to you that I will enter a convent, and you shall
      never see my face again. Have pity!"
    
    
      "Pray heaven, madame, that it may be your lover's sword that pierces my
      heart. It is your only hope, for then you will be free."
    
    
      He tore his coat from her fingers with brutal violence, and the unhappy
      woman fell to the floor with a shriek as he closed the door upon her, and
      followed his antagonist downstairs.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XVII.
    
    
      BLADE TO BLADE.
    
    
      Several times in the course of this interview Norbert de Champdoce had
      been on the point of bursting into a furious passion, but he restrained
      himself from a motive of self-pride; but now that his wife was no longer
      present, he showed a savage intensity of purpose and a deadly earnestness
      that was absolutely appalling. As he followed Croisenois down the great
      staircase, he kept repeating the words, "Quick! quick! we have lost too
      much time already;" for he saw that a mere trifle might upset all his
      plans       such as a servant returning home before the others. When they
      reached the ground-floor, he led George into a by-room which looked like
      an armory, so filled was it with arms of all kinds and nations.
    
    
      "Here," said he, with a bitter sneer, "we can find, I think, what we
      want;" and placing the candle he carried on the mantelpiece, he leaped
      upon the cushioned seat that ran round the room, and took down from the
      wall several pairs of duelling swords, and, throwing them upon the floor,
      exclaimed, "Choose your own weapon."
    
    
      George was an anxious as Norbert to bring this painful scene to a close,
      for anything was preferable to this hideous state of suspense. The last
      despairing glance of the Duchess had pierced his heart like a dagger
      thrust, and when he saw Norbert thrust aside his trembling wife with such
      brutality, it was all he could do to refrain from striking him down. He
      made no choice of weapons, but grasped the nearest, saying,       
    
    
      "One will do as well as another."
    
    
      "We cannot fight in this darkness," said Norbert, "but I have a means to
      remedy that. Come with me this way, so that we may avoid the observation
      of the porter."
    
    
      They went into the stables, where he took up a large lantern, which he
      lighted.
    
    
      "This," said he, "will afford ample light for our work."
    
    
      "Ah, but the neighbors will see it, too; and at this hour a light in the
      garden is sure to attract attention," observed George.
    
    
      "Don't be afraid; my grounds are not overlooked."
    
    
      They entered the garden, and soon reached the spot to which the Duke had
      alluded. Norbert hung the lantern on the bough of a tree, and it gave the
      same amount of light as an ordinary street lamp.
    
    
      "We will dig the grave in that corner," observed he; "and when it is
      filled in, we can cover it with that heap of stones over there."
    
    
      He threw off his great coat, and, handing a spade to Croisenois, took
      another himself, repeating firmly the words,       
    
    
      "To work! To work!"
    
    
      Croisenois would have toiled all night before he could have completed the
      task, but the muscles of the Duke were hardened by his former laborious
      life, and in forty minutes all was ready.
    
    
      "That will do," said Norbert, exchanging his spade for a sword. "Take your
      guard."
    
    
      Croisenois, however, did not immediately obey. Impressible by nature, he
      felt a cold shiver run through his frame; the dark night, the flickering
      lantern, and all these preparations, made in so cold-blooded a manner,
      affected his nerves. The grave, with its yawning mouth, fascinated him.
    
    
      "Well," said Norbert impatiently, "are you not ready?"
    
    
      "I will speak," exclaimed De Croisenois, driven to desperation. "In a few
      minutes one of us will be lying dead on this spot. In the presence of
      death a man's words are to be relied on. Listen to me. I swear to you, on
      my honor and by all my hopes of future salvation, that the Duchess de
      Champdoce is entirely free from guilt."
    
    
      "You have said that before; why repeat it again?"
    
    
      "Because it is my duty; because I am thinking that, if I die, it will be
      my insane passions that have caused the ruin of one of the best and purest
      women in the world. I entreat you to believe that she has nothing to
      repent of. See, I am not ashamed to descend to entreaty. Let my death, if
      you kill me, be an expiation for everything. Be gentle with your wife; and
      if you survive me, do not make her life one prolonged existence of agony."
    
    
      "Silence, or I shall look upon you as a dastard," returned Norbert
      fiercely.
    
    
      "Miserable fool!" said De Croisenois. "On guard, then, and may heaven
      decide the issue!"
    
    
      There was a sharp clash as their swords crossed, and the combat began with
      intense vigor.
    
    
      The space upon which the rays of the lantern cast a glimmering and
      uncertain light was but a small one; and while one of the combatants was
      in complete shade the other was in the light, and exposed to thrusts which
      he could not see. This was fatal to Croisenois, and, as he took a step
      forward, Norbert made a fierce lunge which pierced him to the heart.
    
    
      The unfortunate man threw up his arms above his head; his sword escaping
      from his nerveless fingers and his knees bending under him, he fell
      heavily backwards without a word escaping from his lips. Thrice he
      endeavored to regain his feet, and thrice he failed in his attempts. He
      strove to speak, but he could only utter a few unintelligible words, for
      his life blood was suffocating him. A violent convulsion shook every limb,
      then arose a long, deep-drawn sigh, and then silence       George de
      Croisenois was dead.
    
    
      Yes, he was dead, and Norbert de Champdoce stood over him with a wild look
      of terror in his eyes, and his hair bristling upon his head, as a shudder
      of horror convulsed his body. Then, for the first time, he realized the
      horror of seeing a man slain by his own hand; and yet what affected
      Norbert most was not that he had killed George de Croisenois       for he
      believed that justice was on his side and that he could not have acted
      otherwise       but the perspiration stood in thick beads upon his
      forehead, as he thought that he must raise up that still warm and
      quivering body, and place it in its unhallowed grave.
    
    
      He hesitated and reasoned with himself for some time, going over all the
      reasons that made dispatch so absolutely necessary       the risk of
      detection, and the honor of his name.
    
    
      He stooped and prepared to raise it, but recoiled again before his hands
      had touched the body. His heart failed him, and once more he assumed an
      erect position. At last he nerved himself, grasped the body, and, with an
      immense exertion of strength, hurled it into the gaping grave. It fell
      with a dull, heavy sound which seemed to Norbert like the roar of an
      earthquake. The violent emotions which he had endured had ended by acting
      on his brain, and, snatching up the spade which his late antagonist had
      used with so unpracticed a hand, shovelled the earth upon the body,
      flattened down the ground, and finally covered it with straw and dead
      leaves.
    
    
      "And this is the end of a man who wronged a Champdoce; yes, his life has
      paid the penalty of his deed."
    
    
      All at once, a few paces off, in the deep shadow of the trees, he thought
      that he detected the outline of a human head with a pair of glittering
      eyes fixed upon him. The shock was so terrible that for an instant he
      stopped and nearly fell, but he quickly recovered himself, and, snatching
      up his blood-stained sword, he dashed to the spot where he fancied he had
      seen this terrible witness of his deed.
    
    
      At this rapid movement on the part of the Duke, a figure started up with a
      faint cry for mercy. It was a woman.
    
    
      She fled with inconceivable swiftness towards the house, but he caught her
      just as she had gained the steps.
    
    
      "Have mercy on me!" cried she. "Do not murder me!"
    
    
      He dragged her back to where the lantern was hanging. She was a girl of
      about eighteen years of age, ugly, badly clothed, and dirty looking.
      Norbert looked earnestly at her, but could not say who she was, though he
      was certain that he had seen her face somewhere.
    
    
      "Who are you?" asked he.
    
    
      She burst into a flood of tears, but made no other reply.
    
    
      "Come," resumed he, in more soothing accents; "you shall not be hurt. Tell
      me who you are."
    
    
      "Caroline Schimmel."
    
    
      "Caroline?" repeated he.
    
    
      "Yes. I have been in your service as scullery maid for the last three
      months."
    
    
      "How is it that you did not go to the wedding with the rest of them?"
    
    
      "It was not my fault. I was asked, and I did so long to go, but I was too
      shabby; I had no finery to put on. I am very poor now, for I have only
      fifteen francs a month, and none of the other maids would lend me anything
      to wear."
    
    
      "How did you come into the garden?" asked Norbert.
    
    
      "I was very miserable, and was sitting in the garden crying, when I
      suddenly saw a light down there. I thought it was theirs, and crept down
      the back stairs."
    
    
      "And what did you see?"
    
    
      "I saw it all."
    
    
      "All what?"
    
    
      "When I got down here, you and the other were digging. I thought you were
      looking for money! but ah, dear me! I was wrong. Then the other began to
      say something, but I couldn't catch a word; then you fought. Oh, it was
      awful! I was so frightened, I could not take my eyes off you. Then the
      other fell down on his back."
    
    
      "And then?"
    
    
      "Then," she faltered, "you buried him, and then              "
    
    
      "Could you recognize this       this other?"
    
    
      "Yes, my lord duke, I did."
    
    
      "Had you ever seen him before? Do you know who he was?"
    
    
      "No."
    
    
      "Listen to me, my girl. If you know how to hold your tongue, if you can
      forget all you have seen to-night, it will be the greatest piece of luck
      for you in the world that you did not go to this wedding."
    
    
      "I won't open my lips to a soul, my lord duke. Hear me swear, I won't. Oh,
      do believe me!"
    
    
      "Very well; keep your oath, and your fortune is made. To-morrow I will
      give you a fine, large sum of money, and you can go back to your village
      and marry some honest fellow to whom you have taken a fancy."
    
    
      "Are you not making game of me?"
    
    
      "No; go to your room and go to bed, as if nothing had happened. Jean will
      tell you what to do to-morrow, and you must obey him as you would me."
    
    
      "Oh, my lord! Oh, my lord duke!"
    
    
      Unable to contain her delight, she mingled her laughter and her tears.
    
    
      And Norbert knew that his name, his honor, and perhaps his life were in
      the hands of a wretched girl like this. All the peace and happiness of his
      life were gone, and he felt like some unhappy prisoner who through the
      bars of his dungeon sees his jailer's children sporting with lighted
      matches and a barrel of gunpowder. He was at her mercy, for well he knew
      that it would resolve into this       that the smallest wish of this girl
      would become an imperative command that he dared not disobey. However
      absurd might be her whims and caprices, she had but to express them, and
      he dared not resist. What means could he adopt to free himself from this
      odious state of servitude? He knew but of one       the dead tell no
      tales. There were four persons who were the sharer of Norbert's secret.
      First, the writer of the anonymous letter; then the Duchess; then Caroline
      Schimmel; and, finally, Jean, to whom he must confide all. With these
      thoughts ringing through his brain, Norbert carefully effaced the last
      traces of the duel, and then bent his steps towards his wife's chamber.
    
    
      He had expected to find her still unconscious on the spot where he had
      left her lying. Marie was seated in an armchair by the side of the fire;
      her face was terribly pale, and her eyes sparkling with the inward flame
      that consumed her.
    
    
      "My honor has been vindicated; the Marquis de Croisenois is no more; I
      have slain your lover, madame."
    
    
      Marie did not start; she had evidently prepared herself for this blow. Her
      face assumed a more proud and disdainful expression, and the light in her
      dark eyes grew brighter and brighter.
    
    
      "You are wrong," said she, "M. de Croisenois was not my lover."
    
    
      "You need no longer take the pains to lie; I ask nothing now."
    
    
      Marie's utter calmness jarred inexpressibly upon Norbert's exasperated
      frame of mind. He would have given much to change this mood of hers, which
      he could not at all understand. But in vain did he say the most cutting
      things, and coupled them with bitter taunts, for she had reached a pitch
      of exaltation far above his sarcasms and abuse.
    
    
      "I am not lying," answered she frigidly. "What should I gain by it? What
      more have I to gain in this world? You desire to learn the truth; here it
      is then: It was with my knowledge and permission that George was here
      to-night. He came because I had asked him to do so, and I left the gate in
      the garden wall open, so as to facilitate his entrance. He had not been
      more than five minutes in the room, when you arrived, and he had never
      been there before. It would have been easy for me to have left you; but as
      I bear your name, I could not dishonor it. As you entered, he was
      entreating me to fly with him; both his life and his honor were in my
      hands. Ah, why did I pause for an instant? Had I consented, he would still
      have been alive, and in some far distant country he and I might have
      learned that this world has something more to offer than unhappiness and
      misery. Yes, as you will have it, you shall have all. I loved him ere I
      knew that you even existed. I have only my own folly to blame, only my own
      unhappy weakness to deplore. Why did I not steadily refuse to become your
      wife? You say that you have slain George. Not so, for in my heart his
      memory will ever remain bright and ineffaceable."
    
    
      "Beware!" said Norbert furiously, "beware if              "
    
    
      "Ah, would you kill me too? Do not fear resistance; my life is a blank
      without him. He is dead; let death come to me; it would be a welcome
      visitant. The only kindness that you could now bestow upon me would be my
      death-blow. Strike then, and end it all! In death we should be united,
      George and I; and as my limbs grew stiff and my breath passed away, my
      whitening lips would murmur words of thanks."
    
    
      Norbert listened to her, overwhelmed by the intensity of her passion, and
      marvelling that he had any power to feel after the terrible event which
      had fallen upon his devoted head.
    
    
      Could this be Marie, the soft and gentle woman, who spoke with such
      passionate vehemence and boldly braved his anger? How could he have so
      misunderstood her? He forgot all his anger in his admiration. She seemed
      to him to have undergone a complete change. There was an unearthly style
      of beauty around her       her eyes blazed and shone with the lurid light
      of a far-distant planet, while her wealth of raven hair fell in disordered
      masses on her shoulders. It was passion, real passion, that he beheld
      to-night, not that mere empty delusion which he had so long followed
      blindly. Marie was really capable of a deep-rooted feeling of adoration
      for the man she loved, while with Diana de Mussidan, the woman with her
      fair hair and the steel-blue eyes, love was but the lust of conquest, or
      the desire to jeer at a suitor's earnestness. Ah, what a revelation had
      been made to him now! And what would he not have given to have wiped out
      the past! He advanced towards her with outstretched arms.
    
    
      "Marie!" said he, "Marie!"
    
    
      "I forbid you to call me Marie!" shrieked she wildly.
    
    
      He made no reply, but still advanced towards her, when, with a terrible
      cry, she recoiled from him.
    
    
      "Blood!" she screamed, "ah, heavens! he has blood upon his hands!"
    
    
      Norbert glanced downwards; upon the wristband of his shirt there was a
      tell-tale crimson stain.
    
    
      The Duchess raised her hand, and pointed towards the door.
    
    
      "Leave me," said she, with an extraordinary assumption of energy, "leave
      me; the secret of your crime is safe; I will not betray you or hand you
      over to justice. But remember that a murdered man stands between us, and
      that I loathe and execrate you."
    
    
      Rage and jealousy tortured Norbert's soul. Though George de Croisenois was
      no more, he was still his successful rival in Marie's love.
    
    
      "You forget," said he in a voice hoarse with passion, "that you are mine,
      and that, as your husband, I can make your existence one long scene of
      agony and misery. Keep this fact in your memory. To-morrow, at six
      o'clock, I shall be here."
    
    
      The clock was striking two as he left the house and hastened to the spot
      where he had left his horse.
    
    
      The soldier was still pacing backwards and forwards, leading the Duke's
      horse.
    
    
      "My faith!" said the man, as soon as he perceived Norbert, "you pay
      precious long visits. I had only leave to go to the theatre, and I shall
      get into trouble over this."
    
    
      "Pshaw! I promised you twenty francs. Here are two louis."
    
    
      The soldier pocketed the money with an air of delighted surprise, and
      Norbert sprang into the saddle.
    
    
      An hour later he gave the appointed signal upon the window pane, behind
      which the trusty Jean was waiting.
    
    
      "Take care that no one sees you as you take the horse to the stable," said
      the Duke hastily, "and then come to me, for I want your assistance and
      advice."
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XVIII.
    
    
      THE HEIR OF CHAMPDOCE.
    
    
      As long as she was in Norbert's presence, anger and indignation gave the
      Duchess de Champdoce strength; but as soon as she was left alone her
      energy gave way, and with an outburst of tears she sank, half fainting,
      upon a couch. Her despair was augmented from the fact that she felt that
      had it not been for her, George de Croisenois would never have met with
      his death.
    
    
      "Had I not made that fatal appointment," she sobbed, "he would be alive
      and well now; my love has slain him as surely as if my hand had held the
      steel that has pierced his heart!"
    
    
      She at first thought of seeking refuge with her father, but abandoned the
      idea almost immediately, for she felt that he would refuse to enter into
      her grievance, or would say, "You are a duchess; you have an enormous
      fortune. You must be happy; and if you are not, it must be your own
      fault."
    
    
      In terrible anguish the night passed away; and when her maids entered the
      room, they found her lying on the floor, dressed as she had been the night
      before. No one knew what to do, and messengers were dispatched in all
      directions to summon medical advice.
    
    
      Norbert's return was eagerly welcomed by the terrified domestics, and a
      general feeling of relief pervaded the establishment.
    
    
      The Duke had grown very uneasy as to what might have happened during his
      absence. He questioned the servants as diplomatically as he could; and
      while he was thus engaged, the doctors who had been summoned arrived.
    
    
      After seeing their patient, they did not for a moment conceal their
      opinion that the case was a very serious one, and that it was possible
      that she might not survive this mysterious seizure. They impressed upon
      Norbert the necessity of the Duchess being kept perfectly quiet and never
      left alone, and then departed, promising to call again in the afternoon.
    
    
      Their injunctions were unnecessary, for Norbert had established himself by
      his wife's bedside, resolved not to quit her until her health was
      re-established or death had intervened to release her from suffering.
      Fever had claimed her for its own, and in her delusion she uttered many
      incoherent ravings, the key to which Norbert alone held, and which filled
      his soul with dread and terror.
    
    
      This was the second time that Norbert had been compelled to watch over a
      sick-bed, guarding within his heart a terrible secret. At Champdoce he had
      sat by his father's side, who could have revealed the terrible attempt
      against his life; and now it was his wife that he was keeping a watch on,
      lest her lips should utter the horrible secret of the death of George de
      Croisenois.
    
    
      Compelled to remain by his wife's side, the thoughts of his past life
      forced themselves upon him, and he shuddered to think that, at the age of
      twenty-five he had only to look back upon scenes of misery and crime,
      which cast a cloud of gloom and horror over the rest of his days. What a
      terrible future to come after so hideous a past!
    
    
      He had another source of anxiety, and frequently rang the bell to inquire
      for Jean.
    
    
      "Send him to me as soon as he comes," was his order.
    
    
      At last Jean made his appearance, and his master led him into a
      deeply-recessed window.
    
    
      "Well?" asked he.
    
    
      "All is settled, my lord; be easy."
    
    
      "And Caroline?"
    
    
      "Has left. I gave her twenty thousand francs, and saw her into the train
      myself. She is going to the States, where she hopes to find a cousin who
      will marry her; at least, that is her intention."
    
    
      Norbert heaved a deep sigh of relief, for the thought of Caroline Schimmel
      had laid like a heavy burden upon his heart.
    
    
      "And how about the other matter?" asked he.
    
    
      The old man shook his head.
    
    
      "What has been done?"
    
    
      "I have got hold of a young fellow who believes that I wish to send him to
      Egypt, to purchase cotton. He will start to-morrow, and will post the two
      letters written by the Marquis de Croisenois, one at Marseilles, and the
      other at Cairo."
    
    
      "Do you not think that these letters will insure my perfect security?"
    
    
      "I see that any indiscretion on our agent's part, or a mere act of
      carelessness, may ruin us."
    
    
      "And yet it must be done."
    
    
      After consulting together, the doctors had given some slight hope, but the
      position of the patient was still very precarious. It was suggested that
      her intellect might be permanently affected; and during all these long and
      anxious hours Norbert did not even dare to close his eyes, and it was with
      feelings of secret terror that he permitted the maids to perform their
      duties around their invalid mistress.
    
    
      Upon the fourth day the fever took a favorable turn, and Marie slept,
      giving Norbert time to review his position.
    
    
      How was it that Madame de Mussidan, who was a daily visitor, had not
      appeared at the house since that eventful night? He was so much surprised
      at this that he ventured to dispatch a short note, acquainting her of the
      sudden illness of his wife.
    
    
      In an hour he received a reply, merely containing these words:       
    
    
      "Can you account for M. de Mussidan's sudden determination to spend the
      winter in Italy? We leave this evening. Farewell.       D."
    
    
      And so she, too, had abandoned him, taking with her all the hopes he had
      in the world. Still, however, his infatuation held its sway over him, and
      he forced himself to believe that she felt this separation as keenly as he
      did.
    
    
      Some five days afterwards, when the Duchess de Champdoce had been
      pronounced out of immediate danger, one of the doctors took him
      mysteriously aside. He said that he wanted to inform the Duke of a
      startling, but he hoped a welcome piece of intelligence       that the
      Duchess de Champdoce was in the way to present the Duke with an heir to
      his title and estates.
    
    
      It was the knowledge of this that had decided her not to leave her
      husband's roof, and had steeled her heart against George's entreaties. She
      had hesitated, and had almost yielded to the feelings of her heart, when
      this thought troubled her.
    
    
      Unfortunately for herself, she had not disclosed her condition to her
      husband, and, at the news, all Norbert's former suspicions revived, and
      his wrath rose once more to an extraordinary height. His lips grew pale,
      and his eyes blazed with fury.
    
    
      "Thank you, doctor!" exclaimed he. "Of course, the news is very welcome.
      Good-by. I must go to the Duchess at once."
    
    
      Instead of going to his wife, Norbert went and locked himself up in his
      own private apartment. He had need to be alone, in order to look this
      fresh complication more fully in the face, and the more he reflected, the
      more convinced was he that he had been the dupe of a guilty woman. He had
      begun by doubting, and he ended by being convinced that the child was not
      his. Was he to accept this degraded position, and rear up as his own the
      child of George de Croisenois? The child would grow up under his own
      roof-tree, bear his name, and finally inherit his title and gigantic
      fortune. "Never," muttered he. "No, never; for sooner than that, I will
      crush the life out of it with my own hands!"
    
    
      The more he thought how he should have to deceive the world by feigning
      love and lavishing caresses upon this interloping child, the more he felt
      that it would be impossible to perform his task. He had, however, much to
      do at present. The sudden and mysterious disappearance of George de
      Croisenois had created much stir and excitement in Paris, and the letter
      which had been posed by the agent dispatched by Jean, instead of
      explaining matters, had only deepened the mystery and caused fresh grounds
      of surprise to arise in the minds of the friends of the Marquis and the
      police authorities. But the disappearance of the Marquis was only a nine
      days' wonder after all. Some other strange event excited the attention of
      the fickle public, and George de Croisenois' name was no longer in every
      one's mouth.
    
    
      Norbert breathed freely once more, for he felt his secret was safe.
    
    
      Diana de Mussidan had now been absent for three months and had not
      vouchsafed him a single line. A river of blood flowed between him and his
      wife. Among all his acquaintances he had not one friend on whom he could
      rely, and his reckless life of debauchery and dissipation began to weary
      him. His thoughts were always fixed upon this coming child. How could he
      ever bear to bring it up as if it were his own? He had thought over many
      plans, but always trusted to the first one he had conceived. This was to
      procure an infant, it mattered not where or by what means, and substitute
      it for the new-born child of his wife. As time rolled on, he became more
      imbued with this idea, and at length he summoned Jean to him, that
      faithful old man, who served his master so truly out of affection to the
      house of Champdoce.
    
    
      For the first time Jean raised an objection to his master's proposal,
      declaring that such an act would bring shame and misery upon all concerned
      in it; but when he found that Norbert was determined, and that, if he
      refused, his master would employ some less scrupulous agent, he, with
      tears in his eyes and a tremor in his voice, promised obedience.
    
    
      About a month later, Jean came to his master and suggested that it would
      be best the accouchement of the Duchess should take place at a
      chateau belonging to the Champdoce family near Montroire, and that this
      once done, he, Jean would arrange everything. The removal was effected
      almost at once, and the Duchess, who was a mere shadow of her former self,
      made no opposition. She and Norbert lived together as perfect strangers.
      Sometimes a week would elapse without their meeting; and if they had
      occasion to communicate, it was done by letter.
    
    
      The estate to which Norbert had conducted the Duchess was admirably
      adapted for his purpose. The unhappy woman was entirely alone in the
      world, and had no one to whom she could apply for protection or advice.
      Her father, the Count de Puymandour, had died suddenly a month before,
      owing to chagrin caused by his defeat when a candidate for a seat in the
      Chamber. The brief note from the despairing mother, in which followed the
      words, "Have mercy! Give me back my child!" hardly describes the terrible
      events that occurred in the lonely Chateau to which Norbert had conducted
      his innocent victim.
    
    
      The child of the Duchess de Champdoce had been placed by Jean in the
      Foundling Hospital at Vendome, while the infant that was baptized with the
      grandiloquent names of Anne Rene, Gontran de Duepair, Marquis de
      Champdoce, was the bastard child of a girl living near Montroire, who was
      known in the neighborhood as "The Witch."
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XIX.
    
    
      MASCARIN SPEAKS.
    
    
      This was the conclusion of the manuscript handed by Mascarin to Paul
      Violaine, and the young man laid down the roll of paper with the remark,
      "And that is all."
    
    
      He had consumed six hours in reading this sad account of the follies and
      crimes of the owners of illustrious names.
    
    
      Mascarin had listened with the complacency of an author who hears his own
      work read aloud to him, but all the while he was keenly watching him
      beneath his spectacles and the faces of his companions. The effect that
      was produced was immense, and exactly what he had anticipated. Paul,
      Hortebise, and Catenac gazed upon each other with faces in which
      astonishment at the strange recital, and then at the power of the man who
      had collected these facts together, were mingled, and Catenac was the
      first who spoke. The sound of his own voice seemed gradually to dispel the
      vague sense of apprehension that hung about the office.
    
    
      "Aha!" cried he, "I always said that our old friend Mascarin would make
      his mark in literature. As soon as his pen touches the paper the business
      man vanishes; we have no longer a collection of dry facts and proofs, but
      the stirring pages of a sensational novel."
    
    
      "Do you really consider that as a mere romance?" asked Hortebise.
    
    
      "It reads like one certainly; you must allow that."
    
    
      "Catenac," remarked Mascarin in his bitterly sarcastic tone, "is best able
      to pronounce upon the truth or falsehood of this narrative, as he is the
      professional adviser of this same Duke de Champdoce, the very Norbert
      whose life has just been read to you."
    
    
      "I do not deny that there is some slight foundation to it," returned the
      lawyer.
    
    
      "Then what is it that you do deny?"
    
    
      "Nothing, nothing; I merely objected, more in jest than otherwise, to the
      sentimental manner in which you have set forward your case."
    
    
      "Catenac," remarked Mascarin, addressing the others, "has received many
      confidential communications from his noble client, which he has not
      thought fit to communicate to us; and though he fancied that we were
      drifting into quicksands and among breakers, he displayed no signal of
      warning to save us from our danger, hoping, like a true friend, that, by
      this means, he might get rid of us."
    
    
      Catenac began to utter protestations and denials, but Mascarin cut him
      short with an imperative gesture, and, after a long pause, he again
      commenced,       
    
    
      "You must understand that my inquisitors have had but little to do in this
      affair, for my work has chiefly consisted in putting fragments together.
      It is not to me that you are indebted for the sensational (I think that
      that was the term used) part of my story, but rather to Madame de Mussidan
      and Norbert de Champdoce. I am sure that some of the phrases must have
      struck you considerably."
    
    
      "It seems to me," objected Catenac       
    
    
      "Perhaps," broke in Mascarin, "you have forgotten the correspondence which
      the Countess de Mussidan preserved so carefully       both his letters and
      her own, which Norbert returned to her."
    
    
      "And we have those?"
    
    
      "Of course we have, only there is a perfect romance contained in these
      letters. What I have read is a mere bald extract from them; and this is
      not all. The man who assisted me in the unravelling of this dark intrigue
      was the original promoter       Daumon."
    
    
      "What, is the Counsellor still alive?"
    
    
      "Certainly, and you know him. He is not quite in his first youth, and has
      aged somewhat, but his intellect is as brilliant as ever."
    
    
      Catenac grew serious. "You tell me a great deal," said he.
    
    
      "I can tell you even more. I can tell you that the account of the deed was
      written under the dictation of Caroline Schimmel," broke in Mascarin.
      "This unlucky woman started for Havre, intending to sail for the United
      States, but she got no further than that seaport town, for the good looks
      and the persuasive tongue of a sailor induced her to alter her plans. As
      long as her money lasted he remained an ardent lover, but vanished with
      the disappearance of her last thousand-franc note. Starving and
      poverty-stricken, Caroline returned to Paris and to the Duke de Champdoce,
      who accepted her constant demands for money as a penitent expiation of his
      crime. But she remained faithful to her oath; and had it not been for her
      terrible propensity for drink, Tantaine would never have succeeded in
      extracting her secret from her. If, on her recovery from her fit of drunk
      coma, she recollects what has taken place, she will, if I read her
      character right, go straight to the Duke de Champdoce and tell him that
      his secret has passed into better hands."
    
    
      At this idea being promulgated, Catenac started from his chair with a loud
      oath.
    
    
      "Did you think," asked Mascarin, "that I should feel so much at my ease if
      I found that there was the slightest risk? Let us consider what it is that
      Caroline can say. Who is it that she can accuse of having stolen her
      secret from her? Why, only a poor old wretch named Tantaine. How can the
      Duke possibly trace any connection between this miserable writer and
      Catenac?"
    
    
      "Yes, I think that it would be a difficult task."
    
    
      "Besides," pursued Mascarin, "what have we to fear from the Duke de
      Champdoce? Nothing, as far as I can see. Is he not as much in our power as
      the woman he formerly loved       Diana de Mussidan? Do we not hold the
      letters of both of them, and do we not know in what corner of his garden
      to dig to discover a damning piece of evidence? Remember that there will
      be no difficulty in identifying the skeleton, for at the time of his
      disappearance, Croisenois had about him several Spanish doubloons, a fact
      which was given to the police."
    
    
      "Well," said Catenac, "I will act faithfully. Tell me your plans, and I
      will let you know all that I hear from the Duke."
    
    
      For a moment a smile hovered upon Mascarin's lips, for this time he placed
      firm reliance upon the good faith of the lawyer.
    
    
      "Before we go further," said he, "let me conclude this narrative which
      Paul has just read. It is sad and simple. The united ages of the Duke and
      Duchess did not exceed fifty years; they had unlimited wealth, and bore
      one of the grandest historic names of France; they were surrounded with
      every appliance of luxury, and yet their lives were a perfect wreck. They
      simply dragged on an existence and had lost all hopes of happiness, but
      they made up their minds to conceal the skeleton of their house in the
      darkest cupboard, and the world knew nothing of their inner life. The
      Duchess suffered much in health, and merely went out to visit the sick and
      poor. The Duke worked hard to make up for the deficiencies of his early
      education, and made a name and reputation throughout Europe."
    
    
      "And how about Madame de Mussidan?" asked Catenac.
    
    
      "I am coming to that," returned Mascarin. "With that strange determination
      that fills the hearts of our women, she did not consider her revenge
      complete until Norbert learned that she was the sole instrument in heaping
      the crowing sorrow of his life on his head; and on her return from Italy,
      she sent for him and told him everything. Yes, she absolutely had the
      audacity to tell him that it was she who had done her best to throw his
      wife into De Croisenois' arms. She told him that it was she who had worked
      the arrangements for the meeting, and had written the anonymous letter."
    
    
      "Why did he not kill her?" cried Hortebise. "Had she not all his letters,
      and taunted him with the production of them? Ah, my dear friends, do not
      let us flatter ourselves that we have the sole monopoly of blackmailing.
      The high-born Countess plunged her hand into the Duke's coffers just as if
      she had been a mere adventuress. It is only ten days ago that she borrowed       you
      will observe the entry of it as a loan       a large sum to settle an
      account of Van Klopen's. But let us now speak of the child who took the
      place of the boy whom the Duchess brought into the world. You know him,
      doctor?"
    
    
      "Yes, I have often seen him. He was a good-looking young fellow."
    
    
      "He was, but he was a degraded scoundrel, after all. He was educated and
      brought up without regard to expense, but he always displayed low tastes,
      and, had he lived, would have brought discredit on the name he bore. He
      was a thorn in the side of the Duke and Duchess, and I believe that they
      felt great relief when he died of brain fever, brought on by a drunken
      debauch. His parents, or those whom he supposed to be such, were present
      at his death-bed, for they had learned to consider their sorrows as the
      just chastisement of heaven. The boy having died, the family of Champdoce
      seemed likely to become extinct, and then it was that Norbert decided to
      do what his wife had long urged upon him, to seek for and reclaim the
      child which he had caused to be placed in the Foundling Hospital at
      Vendome. It went against his pride to diverge from the course he had
      determined on as best, but doubts had arisen in his mind as to his wife's
      guilt, and Diana's confessions had reassured him as to the paternity of
      the missing boy. It was thus with hope in his heart, and furnished with
      every necessary document, that he started for Vendome; but there a
      terrible disappointment awaited him. The authorities of the hospital, on
      consulting the register, found that a child had been admitted on the day
      and hour mentioned by Norbert, and that his description of the infant's
      clothing tallied exactly with the entries. But the child was no longer in
      the hospital, and there was no clue to his whereabouts. He had, at the age
      of twelve, been apprenticed to a tanner, but he had run away from his
      master, and the most active and energetic search had failed to arrest the
      fugitive."
    
    
      Catenac listened to all these exact details with an unpleasant feeling
      gnawing at his heart, for he saw that his associates knew everything, and
      he had relied upon again securing their confidence by furnishing them with
      those details which were evidently already known to them. Mascarin,
      however, affected not to notice his surprise, and went on with his
      narrative.
    
    
      "This terrible disappointment will certainly kill the Duke de Champdoce.
      It seemed to him that after having so bitterly expiated the crimes and
      follies of his youth, he might hope to have his old age in peace and
      quiet, with a son who might cheer the loneliness of his desolate fireside.
      His countenance, as soon as he appeared before the Duchess, who had been
      expecting his return in an agony of anguish and suspense, told her at once
      that all hope had fled. In a few days, however, the Duke had perfectly
      recovered from the shock, and had decided that to give up the search would
      be an act of madness. The world is wide, and a friendless boy, without a
      name, difficult to trace; but, with ample funds, almost anything can be
      done, and he was willing to sacrifice both life and fortune to attain his
      object. So immense were his resources, that it was easy for him to employ
      the most skilful detectives; and whatever the result might be, he had come
      to look upon this task as a sacred duty to which he ought to devote all
      the remaining years of his life. He swore that he would never rest or
      cease from his search until he had been furnished with the indisputable
      proofs of the existence or the death of his son. He did not confide all
      this project to the Duchess; for he feared       and he had by this time
      learned to have some consideration for her enfeebled frame       her
      health had given way so completely that any extra degree of excitement
      might prove fatal to her. He, therefore, as a preliminary, applied to that
      element which in the Rue de Jerusalem acts as the terrestrial guardians of
      society. But the police could do nothing for the Duke. They heard what he
      had to say gravely, took notes, told him to call again later on, and there
      was an end to their proceedings. It can easily be understood that the rank
      and position of the Duke prevented him from making his name known in his
      inquiries; and as he dared not divulge the whole truth, he gave such a
      bald version of the case, that it excited no deep feelings of interest. At
      last he was sent to a certain M. Lecoq."
    
    
      To Paul's utter astonishment, the name produced a sudden and terrible
      effect upon Doctor Hortebise, who started to his feet as if propelled from
      his chair by the unexpected application of some hidden motive power, and,
      fingering the locket that hung from his chain, gazed round upon his
      associates with wild and excited eyes.
    
    
      "Stop!" cried he. "If that fellow Lecoq is to put his nose into your case,
      I withdraw; I will have nothing to do with it, for it is certain to be a
      failure."
    
    
      He appeared to be so thoroughly frightened, that Catenac condescended to
      smile.
    
    
      "Yes, yes," said he, "I can understand your alarm; but be at ease; Lecoq
      has nothing to do with us."
    
    
      But Hortebise was not satisfied with Catenac's assurance, and looked for
      confirmation from Mascarin.
    
    
      "Lecoq has nothing to do with us," repeated his friend. "The fool said
      that his position prevented him from giving his time to any investigation
      of a private nature, which, by the way, is quite true. The Duke offered
      him a heavy sum to throw up his appointment, but he refused, saying he did
      not work for money, but from love for his profession."
    
    
      "Which is quite true," interrupted Catenac.
    
    
      "However," continued Mascarin, "to cut short my narrative, the Duke, on
      the refusal of Lecoq to act, applied to Catenac."
    
    
      "Yes," answered the lawyer, "and the Duke has placed the conduct of the
      search in my hands."
    
    
      "Have you formed any plan of action?"
    
    
      "Not at present. The Duke said, 'Ask every living soul in the world, if
      you can succeed in no other way'; this is all the instruction he has given
      me; and," added he, with a slight shrug of his shoulders, "I am almost of
      Perpignan's opinion, that the search will be a fruitless one."
    
    
      "Lecoq did not think so."
    
    
      "He only said that he believed he should succeed if he were to take it in
      hand."
    
    
      "Well," answered Mascarin coldly, "I have been certain of success from the
      very commencement."
    
    
      "Have you been to Vendome?" asked Catenac.
    
    
      "Never mind, I have been somewhere, and at this very moment could place my
      hand upon the shoulder of the heir to the dukedom of Champdoce."
    
    
      "Are you in earnest?"
    
    
      "I was never more in earnest in my life. I have found him; only as it is
      impossible for me to appear in the matter, I shall delegate to you and
      Perpignan the happiness of restoring the lost son to his father's arms."
    
    
      Catenac glanced from Mascarin to Hortebise, and from them to Paul, and
      seemed to wish to be certain that he was not being made an object of
      ridicule.
    
    
      "And why do you not wish to appear in the matter?" asked he at last, in a
      suspicious tone of voice. "Do you foresee some risk, and want me to bear
      the brunt?"
    
    
      Mascarin shrugged his shoulders.
    
    
      "First," said he, "I am not a traitor, as you know well enough; and then
      the interests of all of us depend on your safety. Can one of us be
      compromised without endangering his associates? You know that this is
      impossible. All you have to do is to point out where the traces commence;
      others will follow them at their own risk, and all you will have to do
      will be to look calmly on."
    
    
      "But       "
    
    
      Mascarin lost his patience, and with a deep frown, replied,       
    
    
      "That is enough. We require no more argument, I am the master, and it is
      for you to obey."
    
    
      When Mascarin adopted this tone, resistance was out of the question; and
      as he invariably made all yield to him, it was best to obey with a good
      grace, and Catenac relapsed into silence, completely subjugated and very
      much puzzled.
    
    
      "Sit down at my desk," continued Mascarin, "and take careful notes of what
      I now say. Success is, as I have told you, inevitable, but I must be ably
      backed. All now depends upon your exactitude in obeying my orders; one
      false step may ruin us all. You have heard this, and cannot say that you
      are not fully warned."
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XX.
    
    
      A SUDDEN CHECK.
    
    
      Catenac seated himself at the writing-table without a word, concealing his
      anger and jealousy beneath a careless smile. Mascarin was no longer the
      plotter consulting with his confederates; he was the master issuing his
      orders to his subordinates. He had now taken from a box some of those
      square pieces of pasteboard, which he spent his time in reading over.
    
    
      "Try and not miss one word of what I am saying," remarked he, bending his
      keen glance upon Paul; then, turning to Catenac, he continued, "Can you
      persuade the Duke de Champdoce and Perpignan to start for Vendome on
      Saturday?"
    
    
      "Perhaps I may be able to do so."
    
    
      "I want a Yes or No. Can you or can you not make these people go there?"
    
    
      "Well, yes, then."
    
    
      "Very well. Then, on going to Vendome, you will stop at the Hotel de
      Porte."
    
    
      "Hotel de Porte," repeated Catenac, as he made a note of the name.
    
    
      "Upon the day of your arrival at Vendome," continued Mascarin, "you could
      do very little. Your time would be taken up in resting after your journey,
      and perhaps you may make a few preliminary inquiries. It will be on Sunday
      that you will go to the hospital together, and make the same inquires
      which the Duke formerly made by himself. The lady superior is a woman of
      excellent taste and education, and she will do all that she can to be
      useful to you. Through her you will be able to obtain the boy's
      description, and the date on which he left the hospital to be apprenticed
      to a tanner. She will tell you that, disliking the employment, he ran away
      from them at the age of twelve and a half years, and that since then no
      trace of him has been found. You will hear from her that he was a tall,
      well-built lad, looking two years older than he really was, with an
      intelligent cast of feature, and keen, bright eyes, full of health and
      good looks. He had on, on the day of his disappearance, blue and white
      striped trousers, a gray blouse, a cap with no peak, and a spotted silk
      cravat. Then to assist you still further in your researches she will add
      that he carried in a bundle, enveloped in a red plaid cotton handkerchief,
      a white blouse, a pair of gray cloth trousers, and a pair of new shoes."
    
    
      Catenac watched Mascarin as he was speaking with an expression of
      ill-concealed enmity.
    
    
      "You are well informed, on my word," muttered he.
    
    
      "I think I am," returned Mascarin. "After this you will go back to the
      hotel, and not until then       do you understand?       and you will
      consult as to the first steps to be taken. The plan proposed by Perpignan
      is an excellent one."
    
    
      "What! you know it then?"
    
    
      "Of course I do. He proposed to divide Vendome and its suburbs into a
      certain number of circles, and to make a house-to-house visitation in each
      of them. Let him go to work in this manner. Of course, to do so, you will
      require a guide."
    
    
      "Of course we should require such a person."
    
    
      "Here, Catenac, I must leave a little to chance, for I am not quite
      omnipotent. But there are nine chances out of ten that your host will
      advise you to avail yourself of the services of a man called Frejot, who
      acts as commissioner to the hotel. It may be, however, that he may
      designate some one else; but in that case you must, by some means or
      other, manage to employ the services of one other man."
    
    
      "What am I to say to him?"
    
    
      "He understands what he is to do completely. Well, these preliminaries
      being settled, you will commence on Monday morning to search the suburb
      called Areines, under the guidance of Frejot. Leave all the responsibility
      to Perpignan, but make sure that the Duke comes with you. Ask the denizens
      a series of questions which you have prepared beforehand, such as 'My
      friends, we are in search of a boy. A reward of ten thousand francs is
      offered to any one who will put us on his track. He must have left these
      parts in August, 1856, and some of you may have seen him.'"
    
    
      Here Catenac stopped Mascarin.
    
    
      "Wait a moment. Your own words are excellent; I will write them down."
    
    
      "All Monday," continued Mascarin, "you will not make much progress, and
      for the next few days it will be the same, but on Saturday prepare
      yourself for a great surprise; for on that day Frejot will take you to a
      large, lonely farmhouse, on the shores of a lake. This farm is held by a
      man named Lorgelin, who cultivates it with the assistance of his wife and
      his two sons. You will find these worthy people at dinner. They will offer
      you some refreshment, and you will accept. At the next word you utter you
      will find that they will glance at each other in a meaning manner, and the
      wife will exclaim, 'Blessed Virgin! Surely the gentleman is speaking of
      the poor lad we have so often talked about.'"
    
    
      As Mascarin went on describing his arrangements, his whole form seemed to
      dilate, and his face shone with the knowledge of mastery and power. His
      voice was so clear and his manner so full of authority and command, that
      it carried conviction to the minds of all those who were seated listening
      to him. He spoke of what would happen as if he was dealing with an
      absolute certainty, and went on with such wonderful lucidity and force of
      reasoning that they seemed to be absolutely real.
    
    
      "Oh! the farmer's wife will say this, will she?" demanded Catenac, in a
      tone of the utmost surprise.
    
    
      "Yes, this, and nothing more. Then the husband will explain that they
      found the poor lad half dead in a ditch by the side of the road, and that
      they took him home, and did what they could for him; and will add, this
      was in the beginning of September, 1856. You will offer to read him your
      description of the lad, but he will volunteer his own, which you will find
      exactly to tally with the one you have. Then Lorgelin will tell you what
      an excellent lad he was, and how the farm seemed quite another place as
      long as he remained there. All the family will join in singing his praises       he
      was so good-tempered, so obliging, and at thirteen he could write like a
      lawyer's clerk. And then they will produce some of his writing in an old
      copy book. But after all the old woman, with a tear in her eye, will say
      that she found the lad had not much gratitude in his composition, for at
      the end of the following September he left the farm where he had received
      so much kindness. Yes, he left them to go away with some strolling
      performers. You will be absolutely affected by the words of these worthy
      people, and before you leave they will show you the clothes the lad left
      behind him."
    
    
      Catenac was waiting for the conclusion, and then exclaimed, in rather a
      disappointed tone,       
    
    
      "But I do not see what we have gained when Lorgelin's story has been
      repeated to us."
    
    
      Mascarin raised his hand, as though to deprecate immediate criticism, and
      to ask for further patience on the part of his audience.
    
    
      "Permit me to go on," said he. "You would now not know what to do, but
      Perpignan will not hesitate for a moment. He will tell you that he holds
      the end of the clue, and that all that remains to be done is to follow it
      up carefully."
    
    
      "I think that you overrate Perpignan's talents."
    
    
      "Not a bit; each man to his own line of business. Besides, if he wanders
      off the course, you must get him back to it. In this you must act
      diplomatically. His first move will naturally be to take you to the office
      of the mayor of the township, where a register of licenses is kept. There
      you will find that in September, 1857, there passed through the place a
      troupe of travelling performers, consisting of nine persons, with the
      caravans, under the management of a man known as Vigoureux, nicknamed the
      Grasshopper."
    
    
      Catenac rapidly jotted down these items. "Not so fast," said he; "I cannot
      follow you."
    
    
      After a short pause, Mascarin continued.
    
    
      "An attentive examination of the book will prove to you that no other
      troupe of itinerant performers passed through the place during that month;
      and it is clear that it must have been the Grasshopper with whom the lad
      went away. You will then peruse the man's description. Vigoureux, born at
      Bourgogne, Vosges. Age, forty-seven. Height, six feet two inches. Eyes,
      small and gray, rather near-sighted. Complexion dark. Third finger of left
      hand cut off at first joint. If you confound him, after reading this, with
      any other man of his profession, you must certainly be rather foolish."
    
    
      "I shall now be able to find him," muttered Catenac.
    
    
      "But that is Perpignan's business. You will see him put on an air of the
      greatest importance, and appear quite overjoyed at the news he has
      obtained at the office of the mayor. He will say that the inquiry at
      Vendome is over, and that it will be best to return to Paris at once. Of
      course, you will make no objection. You will permit the Duke to make a
      handsome present to Lorgelin and Frejot; but take care not to leave him
      behind you. I advise you to regain Paris without a moment's delay. The
      wily Perpignan, on your return, will at once take you to the head police
      office, where Vigoureux will have left his papers, like other men of his
      profession. If there is any difficulty in obtaining a sight of them, the
      Duke de Champdoce will act as a talisman. You will then discover that in
      1864, the man Vigoureux was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for
      disorderly conduct, and that he now keeps a wine-shop at the corner of the
      Rue Depleux."
    
    
      "Stop a bit," said Catenac, "and let me take down the address."
    
    
      "When you go there, you will recognize Vigoureux by the loss of his
      finger. He will at once admit that the lad followed him, and remained in
      the troupe for ten months. He was a good enough lad, but as grand as a
      peacock, and as lazy as a dormouse. He made great friends with an old
      Alsatian, called Fritz, who was the conductor of the orchestra, and
      by-and-by both were so fond of each other, that one day they went off in
      each other's company. Now you want to know what has become of Fritz? I
      know Vigoureux will get tired of this prolonged string of questions, and
      behave violently; then you will threaten him for having carried off a
      youth of tender years, and he will calm down, and become as mild as
      mother's milk, and will promise to gain information for you. In a week he
      will give the information that Fritz is to be found at the Hospital
      Magloire."
    
    
      Absolutely dumb with surprise, the audience listened to these strange
      assertions, which dovetailed so exactly into each other, and seemed to
      have been the work of years of research.
    
    
      "Fritz," continued Mascarin, "is a sly old dog. You will find an old,
      rickety, blue-eyed man at the hospital, and remember to tell the Duke de
      Champdoce that he must not put too much faith in him. This wily old
      Alsatian will tell you of all the sacrifices he made for the dear lad. He
      will tell you that he often went without his beer and tobacco in order to
      pay for the music lessons that he forced the boy to take. He will tell you
      that he wanted to get him into the Government School of Music, for that he
      possessed great vocal and instrumental talent, and he cherished the hope
      of one day seeing him a great composer, like Weber or Mozart. I expect
      that this flow of self-praise will melt the heart of your client, for he
      will see that his son had made an effort to rise out of the mire by his
      own exertions, and will, in this energy, recognize one of the
      characteristics of the Champdoce family; and on the strength of this
      testimony he will almost be ready to accept the young man as his son."
    
    
      Catenac had for some time past been striving to decipher the meaning
      hidden behind the inscrutable countenance of Mascarin, but in vain.
    
    
      "Let us get on," said the lawyer impatiently. "All that you have told me I
      shall hear later on in the course of the inquiry."
    
    
      "If your sagacity requires no further explanation from me," rejoined
      Mascarin, "you will, I trust, permit me to continue them for the benefit
      of our young friend, Paul Violaine. You will feel compassion when the
      Alsatian tells you of his sufferings, at the boys' description of him, and
      his subsequent prosperity in the Rue d'Arras. You had better listen to the
      old man as long as he continues to grumble on, the more so as you will
      detect in the rancor and bitterness of his remarks all the vexation of a
      disappointed speculator. He will confess to you besides that he subsists
      entirely on the bounty of the lad, whom he had stigmatized as an
      ungrateful villain. Of course, the Duke will have to leave behind him some
      testimonial of his pleasure, and you will hurry off to the Rue d'Arras.
      The proprietor of the house will tell you that some four years ago he got
      rid of his musician, the only one of his class who had dared to establish
      himself there, and a small present and a few adroit questions will obtain
      for you the address of one of the young man's pupils, Madame Grandorge, a
      widow lady, residing in the Rue St. Louis. This lady will tell you that
      she does not know the address of her former master, but that he used to
      live at 57, Rue de la Harpe. From the Rue de la Harpe you will be sent to
      the Rue Jacob, and from thence to the Rue Montmartre, at the corner of the
      Rue Joquelet."
    
    
      Mascarin paused, drew a long breath, and chuckled inwardly, as though at
      some excellent joke.
    
    
      "Be comforted, Catenac," said he. "You have nearly reached the end of your
      journey. The portress at the house in the Rue Montmartre is the most
      obliging woman in the world. She will tell you that the musician still
      retains his rooms in the house, but that he resides there no longer, for
      he has made a lucky hit, and last month he married the daughter of a
      wealthy banker living close by. The young lady, Mademoiselle Rigal, saw
      him, and fell in love with him."
    
    
      A clever man like Catenac should have foreseen what was coming, but he had
      not, and at this conclusion he uttered a loud exclamation of surprise.
    
    
      "Yes, just so," said Mascarin, with an air of bland triumph. "The Duke de
      Champdoce will then drag you off to our mutual friend Martin Rigal, and
      there you will find our young protégé, the happy husband of the
      beautiful Flavia."
    
    
      Mascarin drew himself up, and adjusted his glasses firmly on his nose.
    
    
      "Now, my dear Catenac, show the liberality and amiability of your
      disposition by congratulating our friend Paul as Gontran, Marquis de
      Champdoce."
    
    
      Hortebise, of course, knew what was coming; he knew the lines of the plot
      of the play as if he had been a joint author of it, and was as much
      excited as if he were assisting at a first rehearsal.
    
    
      "Bravo!" he exclaimed, clapping his hands together. "Bravo, my dear
      Mascarin, you have excelled yourself to-day!"
    
    
      Worried and perplexed as Paul had been, as Mascarin concluded he sank back
      in his chair, sick and giddy with emotion.
    
    
      "Yes," said Mascarin in a clear and ringing voice, "I accept your praise
      without any affectation of false modesty. We have no reason to fear the
      intervention of that grain of sand which sometimes stops the working of
      the machine. Perpignan, poor fool though he is, will be our best friend,
      and will do our work quite unconsciously. Can the Duke retain any atom of
      suspicion after these minute investigations? Impossible. But to remove the
      slightest element of doubt, I have another and an additional plan. I will
      make him retrace the path upon which he has started. He shall take Paul to
      all these various places, and at all of them the statements will be even
      more fully confirmed. Paul, the son-in-law of Martin Rigal, the husband of
      Flavia, will be recognized in the Rue Montmartre, the Rue Jacob, and the
      Rue de la Harpe. He will be joyfully welcomed in the Rue d'Arras; Fritz
      will embrace his ungrateful pupil; Vigoureux will remind him of his
      skillful feats on the trapeze; the Lorgelin family will press the lad whom
      they gave shelter to, to their hearts, and this will happen, Catenac,
      because I will it, and because all the people from the portress in the Rue
      Montmartre to the Lorgelins are my slaves, and dare not disobey one single
      command which I may issue."
    
    
      Catenac rose slowly and solemnly from his seat.
    
    
      "I recognize your patience and ingenuity thoroughly, only I am going with
      one word to crush the fabric of hope that you have so carefully erected."
    
    
      Catenac might be a coward, he might also be a traitor but he was a clever
      and clear-sighted man too. Consequently Hortebise shivered as he heard
      these words, but Mascarin smiled disdainfully, basking in his dream of
      success.
    
    
      "Go on then," said he.
    
    
      "Well, then, let me tell you that you will not overreach and deceive the
      Duke."
    
    
      "And why not, pray?" asked Mascarin. "But are you sure that I wish to
      deceive him? You have not been open with me, why should I be frank with
      you? Am I in the habit of confiding in those who do not repose confidence
      in me? Does Perpignan for a moment suspect the part that he is to play?
      Why may I not have judged it best to keep from you the fact that Paul is
      really the child you are seeking?"
    
    
      Mascarin spoke so confidently that Catenac gazed upon him, hardly knowing
      to what conclusion to come, for his conscience was by no means clear. His
      intellect quickly dived into the depths of all probabilities, and yet he
      could not see in all these combinations any possible peril to himself.
    
    
      "I only hope," said he, "that Paul is all that you represent him to be;
      but why all these precautions? Only, mark my words, the Duke has an
      infallible way of detecting, or rather of preventing, any attempt at
      imposition. It is ever thus, the most trivial circumstance will overset
      the best laid plans, and the inevitable destroy the combinations of the
      most astute intellect."
    
    
      Mascarin interrupted his associate.
    
    
      "Paul is the son of the Duke de Champdoce," said he decisively.
    
    
      What was the meaning of this? Catenac felt that he was being played with,
      and grew angry.
    
    
      "As you please; but you will, I presume, permit me to convince myself of
      the truth of this assertion."
    
    
      Then, advancing towards Paul, the lawyer said,       
    
    
      "Have the goodness to remove your coat."
    
    
      Paul took it off, and threw it upon the back of a chair.
    
    
      "Now," added Catenac, "roll up your right shirt sleeve to the shoulder."
    
    
      Scarcely had the young man obeyed, and the lawyer cast a rapid glance at
      the bare flesh, than he turned to his associates and observed,       
    
    
      "No, he is not the right man."
    
    
      To his extreme surprise, Mascarin and Hortebise burst into a fit of
      unrestrained laughter.
    
    
      "No," pursued the lawyer, "this is not the child who was sent to the
      Hospital of Vendome, and the Duke will recognize this better than I can.
      You laugh, but it is because you do not know all."
    
    
      "Enough," returned Mascarin, and then, turning to the doctor, he remarked,
      "Tell him, my friends, that we know more than he thinks."
    
    
      "And so," said Hortebise, taking Paul's hand, "you are certain that this
      is not the lost child because he has not certain marks about him; but
      these will be seen upon the day on which Paul is introduced to the Duke,
      and legibly enough to satisfy the most unbelieving."
    
    
      "What do you mean?"
    
    
      "Let me explain in my own way. If in early childhood Paul had been scalded
      on his shoulder by boiling water, he would have a scar whose appearance
      would denote its origin?"
    
    
      Catenac nodded, "You are quite accurate," said he.
    
    
      "Well, then listen. Paul is coming home with me. I shall take him into my
      consulting-room; he will lie on a couch. I shall give him chloroform, for
      I do not wish him to suffer any pain. Mascarin will help me. Then I shall
      apply, on the proper part, a piece of flannel steeped in a certain liquid
      which is an invention of my own. I am not a fool, as you may have
      discovered before this; and in a drawer at home is a piece of flannel cut
      so as exactly to resemble the irregular outline of a scar of the kind you
      describe, and a few little bits here and there will do the rest of the
      work artistically. When the liquid has effected its work, which will be in
      ten minutes, I shall remove it, and apply an ointment, another invention
      of my own, to the wound; then I shall restore Paul to his senses, and go
      to dinner."
    
    
      Mascarin rubbed his hands with delight.
    
    
      "But you forget that a certain space of time is required to give a scar
      the appearance of not having been recent," objected Catenac.
    
    
      "Let me speak," broke in the doctor. "If we only needed time       six
      months, say, or a year       we should postpone our concluding act until
      then; but I, Hortebise, assure you that in two months, thanks to another
      discovery of my own       will show you a scar that will pass muster, not
      perhaps before a fellow-practitioner, but certainly before the Duke."
    
    
      Catenac's sunken eyes blazed as he thought of the prospective millions.
    
    
      "May the devil fly away with all scruples!" cried he. "My friends, I am
      yours soul and body; you may rely on your devoted Catenac."
    
    
      The doctor and Mascarin exchanged a look of triumph.
    
    
      "Of course we share and share alike," observed the lawyer. "It is true
      that I come in rather late; but the part I play is a delicate and an
      important one, and you can do nothing without me."
    
    
      "You shall have your share," answered Mascarin evasively.
    
    
      "One word more," said the lawyer. "Do you think that the Duke has kept
      nothing back? The infant was hardly seen by him or the Duchess; but Jean
      saw it, and he, though very old and infirm, would come forward at any
      moment to defend the name and honor of the Champdoce family."
    
    
      "Well, and what then?"
    
    
      "Jean, you know, was against the substitution of another child. May he not
      have foreseen the chance of such a case as this arising?"
    
    
      Mascarin looked grave. "I have thought of that before," returned he; "but
      what can be done?"
    
    
      "I will find out," said Catenac. "Jean has the most implicit confidence in
      me, and I will question him."
    
    
      The cold calmness of the lawyer had vanished, and Catenac only displayed
      the zealous eagerness of the man who, admitted at a late hour into an
      enterprise which he imagines will be lucrative, burns to do as much as he
      can to further it.
    
    
      "But," added he, as an after-thought, "how can we be certain that there is
      no one to recognize Paul?"
    
    
      "I can answer for that; his poverty had isolated him from all but a woman
      named Rose, and I took care that she should be sent to the prison of St.
      Lazare. At one time I was a little anxious, as I heard that Paul had a
      patron; but he, as I have found out, was the Count de Mussidan, the
      murderer of Montlouis, who, as you may have guessed, was Paul's father."
    
    
      "We have nothing, then, to fear from that quarter," said the doctor.
    
    
      "Nothing; and while you get on with your work, I will hurry on Paul's
      marriage with Rigal's daughter. But this will not prevent my busying
      myself in another quarter; for before a month Henri de Croisenois will
      have floated his Company, and become the husband of Sabine de Mussidan."
    
    
      "I think that it is about time for dinner," remarked Hortebise, and,
      turning to the protégé of the association, he added, "Come, Paul."
    
    
      But Paul made no movement, and then for the first time it was seen that
      the poor boy had fainted, and they had to sprinkle cold water upon him
      before he regained consciousness.
    
    
      "Surely," remarked the doctor, "it is not the idea of a trifling operation
      that you will not feel which has so frightened you?"
    
    
      Paul shook his head. "It is not that," said he.
    
    
      "What, then, is it?"
    
    
      "Simply that the real man exists; I know him, and know where he lives."
    
    
      "What do you mean?" they cried.
    
    
      "I know him, I tell you       the son of the Duke de Champdoce."
    
    
      "Let us hear all!" cried Mascarin, who was the first to come to his
      senses. "Explain yourself."
    
    
      "Simply this. I know such a young man, and it was the thought of this that
      made me feel so ill. He is thirty-three. He was at the Foundling Hospital;
      he left it at the age of twelve and a half years; and he has just such a
      scald on his shoulder, which he got when he was apprenticed to a tanner."
    
    
      "And where," asked Mascarin quickly, "is this same young man? What is his
      name, and what does he do for a living?"
    
    
      "He is a painter; his name is Andre, and he lives       "
    
    
      A blasphemous oath from Mascarin interrupted him. "This is the third
      time," said he fiercely, "that this cursed fellow has crossed our path;
      but I swear that it shall be the last."
    
    
      Hortebise and Catenac were livid with alarm.
    
    
      "What do you intend to do?" asked they.
    
    
      "I shall do nothing," answered he; "but you know that this Andre, in
      addition to being a painter, is an ornamental sculptor and house
      decorator, and so is often on lofty scaffolds. Have you never heard that
      accidents frequently happen to that class of people?"
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XXI.
    
    
      A MELANCHOLY MASHER.
    
    
      When Mascarin spoke of suppressing the man who stood in his way as easily
      as if he was alluding to extinguishing a candle, he was not aware that
      there was one circumstance which considerably enhanced the difficulty of
      his task, for Andre had been forewarned, and this note of warning had been
      sounded on the day on which he had received that letter from Sabine, in
      which she spoke in such despairing terms of her approaching marriage,
      which she had been compelled to agree to to save the honor of her family.
      This feeling was strengthened by a long conversation he had had with M. de
      Breulh-Faverlay and the Viscountess de Bois Arden, in which it was
      unanimously decided that the Count and Countess de Mussidan were victims
      of some plot of which Henri de Croisenois was certainly one of the
      promoters. He had no conception on what side to look for the danger, but
      he had an instinctive feeling that it was impending. He prepared,
      therefore, to act on the defensive. It was not only his life that was in
      danger, but his love and his future happiness. M. de Breulh-Faverlay had
      also serious apprehensions for the safety of a man for whom he entertained
      so great a respect and regard.
    
    
      "I would lay a heavy wager," said he, "that we have to do with some
      villainous blackmailers, and the difficulty of the business is, that we
      must do the work ourselves, for we dare not invite the aid of the police.
      We have no proof to offer, and the police will not stir a foot on mere
      suppositions, and we should not earn the thanks of those we are desirous
      of assisting if we called the attention of the law to certain acts in
      their past lives; for who can say what the terrible secret is, that some
      vile wretch holds over the heads of M. and Madame de Mussidan? And it is
      quite on the cards that the Count and the Countess might be compelled to
      join the blackmailers and oppose us. We must act with the greatest
      prudence and caution. Remember, that if you are out at night, you must
      avoid dark corners, for it would be the easiest thing in the world to put
      a knife into your back."
    
    
      The conclusion that was arrived at, at this interview, was that for the
      present Andre and De Breulh should cease to see each other so frequently.
      They felt convinced that a watch had been set on them, and that their
      intimacy would certainly be notified to De Croisenois; and of course they
      had every desire to cause him to imagine that they were not acting in any
      way together. The arrangement, therefore, that they entered into was that
      each should act from his own point of vantage against Henri de Croisenois,
      and that when necessary they should meet in the evening to compare notes
      in a small café in the Champs Elysees, not far from the house in
      which Andre was at work.
    
    
      His courage was still as high as ever, but the first symptoms of rashness
      had vanished. He was a born diplomatist, and fully realized that cunning
      and treachery must be met by similar weapons. He must not break his
      engagement to M. Gandelu; but how could he superintend the workmen and
      keep an eye on Croisenois at the same time? Money was absolutely
      necessary, and yet he felt a strange disinclination to accept a loan from
      M. de Breulh. If he were to throw up his work, it would naturally create
      suspicion.
    
    
      M. Gandelu had a shrewd head, and Andre, remembering the old man's
      kindness to him on all occasions, determined to confide the matter to him,
      and with this object he called on him the next morning as the clock was
      striking nine. His surprise was extreme when he saw Gaston de Gandelu in
      the courtyard. He was just the same looking Gaston, the lover of Madame de
      Chantemille, to the outward eye, but some grave calamity had evidently
      entirely changed the inner man. He was smoking his cigar with an air of
      desperation, and seemed to be utterly weary of the world and its
      belongings.
    
    
      At the moment Andre entered the young man caught sight of him.
    
    
      "Halloo!" said he; "here is my artistic friend. I lay ten to one that you
      have come to ask my father to do you a favor."
    
    
      "You are quite right; is he at home?"
    
    
      "The governor is in the sulks; he has shut himself up, and will not see
      me."
    
    
      "You are joking."
    
    
      "Not I; the old man is a regular despot, and I am sick of everything."
    
    
      Noticing that one of the grooms was listening, Gaston had sufficient sense
      to draw Andre a little on one side.
    
    
      "Do you know," asked he, "that the governor has docked my screw and vows
      that he will advertise himself as not responsible for the debts of yours
      truly; but I cannot think he will do so, for that would be a regular
      smash-up for me. You haven't such a trifle as ten thousand francs about
      you that you could lend me, have you? I'd give twenty thousand for the
      accommodation when I came of age."
    
    
      "I must say       ," began Andre.
    
    
      "All right; never mind; I understand. If you had the ready, you wouldn't
      be hanging about here; but for all that, I must have the cash. Hang it
      all, I signed bills to that amount payable to Verminet. Do you know the
      fellow?"
    
    
      "Not at all."
    
    
      "Where were you dragged up? Why, he is the head of the Mutual Loan
      Society. The only nuisance is, that to make matters run a bit smooth, I
      wrote down the wrong name. Do you tumble, eh?"
    
    
      "But, great heavens! that is forgery," said Andre, aghast.
    
    
      "Not a bit, for I always intended to pay; besides, I wanted the money to
      square Van Klopen. You know him, I suppose?"
    
    
      "No."
    
    
      "Well, he is the chap to dress a girl. I had those costumes for Zora from
      him; but it is out and out the governor's fault. Why did he drive me to
      desperation? Yes, it is all the old man's doing. He wasn't satisfied with
      pitching into me, but he collared that poor, helpless lamb and shut her
      up. She never did him any harm, and I call it a right down cowardly and
      despicable act to hurt Zora."
    
    
      "Zora," repeated Andre, who did not recognize the name.
    
    
      "Yes, Zora; you know; you had a feed with us one day."
    
    
      "Yes, yes; you mean Rose."
    
    
      "That's it; but I don't like any one to call her by that ugly, common
      name. Well, the governor has gone mad about her, and filed a complaint
      against her of decoying a minor, as if I was a fellow any one could decoy.
      Well, the end of it was, that she is now in the prison of St. Lazare."
    
    
      The tears started to the young man's eyes as he related this grievance.
    
    
      "Poor Zora," he added; "I was never mashed on a woman like I was on her.
      And then what a splendid form she has! Why, the hairdresser said he had
      never seen such hair in his life; and she is at St. Lazare. As soon as the
      police came for her, her first thoughts were of me, and she shrieked out,
      'Poor Gaston will kill himself when he hears of this.' The cook told me
      this, and added that her mistress's sufferings were terrible. And she is
      at St. Lazare. I tried to see her, but it was no go;" and here the boy's
      voice broke into a sob.
    
    
      "Come," said Andre, "keep up your spirits."
    
    
      "Ah! you shall see if, as soon as I am twenty-one, I don't marry her. I
      don't put all the blame on the old man. He has been advised by his lawyer,
      a beast by the name of Catenac. Do you know him?"
    
    
      "No."
    
    
      "You don't seem to know any one. Well, I shall send him a challenge
      to-morrow. I have got my seconds all ready. By the way, would you like to
      act for me? I can easily get rid of one of the others."
    
    
      "I have had no experience in such matters."
    
    
      "Ah, then you would be of no use. My seconds must put him into a regular
      blue funk."
    
    
      "In that case       "
    
    
      "No; I know what you are going to say: you mean that I had best look out
      for a military swell; but, after all, the matter lies in a nutshell. I am
      the insulted party, and draw pistols at ten paces. If that frightens him,
      he will make the governor drop all this rubbish."
    
    
      Had his mind not been so much occupied, this rhodomontade on Gaston's part
      would have amused Andre very much, but now he asked himself what would be
      the quickest way to escape from him.
    
    
      Just at this moment a servant emerged from the house.
    
    
      "Sir," said he, addressing Andre, "my master has seen you from his window,
      and begs that you will go up to him at once."
    
    
      "I will be with him immediately," answered Andre; and, holding out his
      hand to Gaston, he took leave of him with a few words of encouragement.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XXII.
    
    
      A GENTLEMAN IN DIFFICULTIES.
    
    
      When Andre had got rid of the young man, and had been ushered into M.
      Gandelu's presence, the change in the gentleman's appearance struck him
      with horror. His eyes were red and swollen as if he had been weeping, but
      as soon as he caught sight of Andre his face brightened, and he welcomed
      him warmly.
    
    
      "Oh, it does me good to see you, and I bless the fortunate chance that has
      brought you here to-day."
    
    
      "It is not a very fortunate chance," answered Andre, as he shook his head
      sadly.
    
    
      For the first time Gandelu noticed the air of gravity which marked the
      young man, and the shade of sorrow upon his brow.
    
    
      "What ails you, Andre?" asked he.
    
    
      "A great misfortune is hanging over me."
    
    
      "What do you mean?"
    
    
      "The naked truth and this misfortune may bring death and despair to me."
    
    
      "I am your friend, my dear boy," said the old man, "and would gladly be of
      service to you. Tell me if I can be of any use?"
    
    
      "I come to you to-day to ask a favor at your hands."
    
    
      "And you thought of the old man, then? I thank you for doing so. Give me
      your hand; I like to feel the grasp of an honest man's hand; it warms my
      heart."
    
    
      "It is the secret of my life that I am going to confide to you," said he,
      with some solemnity.
    
    
      M. Gandelu made no reply, but struck his clenched fist upon his breast, as
      though to show that any secret confided to him would be locked up in the
      safe security of his heart.
    
    
      Then Andre hesitated no longer, and, with the exception of giving names,
      told the whole story of his love, his ambitions, and his hopes, and gave a
      clear account of how matters stood.
    
    
      "How can I help you?" asked M. Gandelu.
    
    
      "Allow me," said Andre, "to hand over the work with which you have
      intrusted me to one of my friends. I will retain the responsibility, but
      will merely act as one of the workmen. This, to a certain extent, will
      give me my liberty, while at the same time I shall be earning a little
      money, which is just now of vast importance to me."
    
    
      "Is that what you call a favor?"
    
    
      "Certainly, and a very great one, too."
    
    
      Gandelu rose hastily, and, opening an iron safe which stood in one corner
      of the room, and taking from it a bundle of banknotes, he placed them on
      the table before Andre with an expressive look, which meant, "Take what
      you desire."
    
    
      The unlooked-for kindness of this man, who forgot all his own sorrows in
      his anxiety to relieve the necessities of another, affected Andre deeply.
    
    
      "I do not need money," began he.
    
    
      With a wave of his hand Gandelu inspired silence. "Take these twenty
      thousand francs," said he, "and then I can tell you why I asked you to
      come upstairs."
    
    
      A refusal would have wounded the old man deeply, and so Andre took the
      proffered loan.
    
    
      Gandelu resumed his seat, and remained in gloomy silence for some time.
    
    
      "My dear boy," said he, in a voice broken by emotion, "a day or two back
      you saw something of the trouble that I am laboring under. I have no
      longer any respect or esteem for that wretched fool, my son, Pierre."
    
    
      Andre had already guessed that he had been incensed with reference to
      something connected with Gaston.
    
    
      "You son has behaved very foolishly," said he; "but remember he is very
      young."
    
    
      A sad smile passed over the old man's face.
    
    
      "My son is old in vice," replied he. "I have thought the matter over only
      too plainly. Yesterday he declared that he would kill himself. An absurd
      threat. Up to this time I have been culpably weak, and it is no use now to
      act in an opposite direction. The unhappy boy is infatuated with a
      degraded woman named Rose, and I have had her locked up; but I have made
      up my mind to let her out again, and also to pay his debts. It is weak
      folly, I allow; but what am I to do? I am his father after all; and while
      I cannot respect her, I must love him. He has almost broken my heart, but
      it was his to do as he liked with."
    
    
      Andre made no reply, and Gandelu went on.
    
    
      "I have not deceived myself; my son is ruined. I can but stand by and wait
      for the end. If this Rose is not everything that is bad, her influence may
      be of some use to him. But I want some one to undertake these
      negotiations, and I had hopes, Andre, that you would have been able to do
      so."
    
    
      Andre felt that all his efforts ought to be devoted to the interests of
      Sabine, but at the same time he could not leave the kind old man to the
      mercy of others, and by a display of absolute heroism he determined to
      accede to the broken-hearted father's desires and briefly told him that he
      was at his service. Gandelu thanked him warmly, and Andre seating himself
      at the table, the two men entered into a long discussion as to the best
      means to be adopted. It was finally decided that Andre should act with
      freedom and according to his own instincts, and that M. Gandelu should, to
      actual appearance, remain firm in the course he had entered upon, and
      should only be induced, by Andre's intercession, to adopt milder measures.
      The result justified their anticipations, for Gaston was even more crushed
      and downcast than Andre had imagined, and it was in an agony of suspense
      that he awaited the return of the young painter. As soon as he saw him
      descending the steps he sprang forward to greet him.
    
    
      "Well," said he, in a tone of eager inquiry.
    
    
      "Your father," returned Andre, "is terribly angry with you, but I hope to
      be able to induce him to do something for you."
    
    
      "Will he set Zora at liberty?"
    
    
      "Perhaps he will; but first he must have something more from you than
      promises       he must have stable guarantees."
    
    
      At these words Gaston's face fell. "Guarantees," answered he sulkily. "Is
      not my word of honor enough? What sort of guarantees does he require?"
    
    
      "That I cannot tell you, and you must find out for yourself; but I will do
      all I can for you."
    
    
      Gaston gazed upon Andre in surprise.
    
    
      "Do you mean to tell me," asked he, "that you can do pretty well what you
      like with the governor?"
    
    
      "Not exactly; but surely you can see that I have a good deal of influence
      over him. If you want a proof of this, see, here is the money to take up
      these bills you told me of."
    
    
      "What, Verminet's?"
    
    
      "I suppose so. I am speaking of those to which you were mad enough to
      forge another man's name."
    
    
      Foolish as the boy was, this act of his had caused him many a sleepless
      night, and he had reflected very often how he could possibly escape from
      the consequence of his act of rashness.
    
    
      "Give me the money," cried he.
    
    
      Andre shook his head, however. "Forgive me," said he, "but this money does
      not quit my hand until the bills are handed over to me. Your father's
      orders on this point are decided; but the sooner we settle the affair the
      better."
    
    
      "That is too bad; the governor is as sly as a fox; but he must have his
      own way, I suppose, so come on. Only just wait till I slip on a coat more
      suitable to my position than this lounging suit."
    
    
      He rushed away, and was back again in ten minutes as neat as a new pin,
      and full of gayety and good spirits.
    
    
      "We can walk," said he, putting his arm through Andre's. "We have to go to
      the Rue St. Anne."
    
    
      Verminet had his office in this street       the office of the Mutual Loan
      Society, of which he was the managing director. The house, in spite of its
      grandiloquent title, was of excessively shabby exterior. The Mutual Loan
      Society was frequented by those who, having lost their credit, wished to
      obtain a fresh amount, and who, having no money, wanted to borrow some.
    
    
      Verminet's plan of financial operations was perfectly simple. A tradesman
      on the verge of bankruptcy would come to him, Verminet would look into his
      case and make him sign bills for the sum he required, handing him in
      exchange bills drawn by other tradesman in quite as serious a predicament
      as himself, and pocketed a commission of two per cent. upon both the
      transactions. Verminet obtained clients from the simple fact that an
      embarrassed tradesman is utterly reckless, cares not what he signs, and
      will clutch at a straw to keep his head above water. But there were many
      other transactions carried on at the office of the Mutual Loan Society,
      for its largest means of income was drawn from even less respectable
      sources, and it was alleged that many of these bogus bills which are
      occasionally cashed by some respectable bankers were manufactured there.
      At any rate, Verminet managed to make money somehow.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XXIII.
    
    
      RINGING THE CHANGES.
    
    
      Andre, who was gifted with plenty of intelligence, at once judged of the
      kind of business done by the Mutual Loan Society by the dinginess of the
      brass plate on the door and the generally dilapidated aspect of the house.
    
    
      "I don't like the look of it at all," said he.
    
    
      "It does not go in for show," answered Gaston, affecting an air of wisdom,
      "but it is deemed handy sometimes. It does all sorts of business that you
      would never think of. A real downy card is Verminet."
    
    
      Andre could easily believe this, for, of course, there could be but one
      opinion concerning the character of a man who could have induced a mere
      simpleton like Gaston to affix a forged signature to the bills which he
      had discounted. He made no remark, however, but entered the house, with
      the interior arrangements of which Gaston appeared to be perfectly
      familiar. They passed through a dirty, ill-smelling passage, went across a
      courtyard, cold and damp as a cell, and ascended a flight of stairs with a
      grimy balustrade. On the second floor Gaston made a halt before a door
      upon which several names were painted. They passed through into a large
      and lofty room. The paper on the walls of this delectable chamber was torn
      and spotted, and a light railing ran along it, behind which sat two or
      three clerks, whose chief occupation appeared to be consuming the
      breakfast which they had brought with them to the office. The heat of the
      stove, which was burning in one corner of the room, the general mouldiness
      of the atmosphere, and the smell of the coarse food, were sufficient to
      turn the stomach of any one coming in from the fresh air.
    
    
      "Where is M. Verminet?" asked Gaston authoritatively.
    
    
      "Engaged," replied one of the clerks, without pausing to empty his mouth
      before he replied.
    
    
      "Don't you talk to me like that. What do I care whether he is engaged or
      not? Tell him that Gaston de Gandelu desires to see him at once."
    
    
      The clerk was evidently impressed by his visitor's manner, and, taking the
      card which was handed to him, made his exit through a door at the other
      end of the room.
    
    
      Gaston was delighted at this first victory, and glanced at Andre with a
      triumphant smile.
    
    
      The clerk came back almost at once. "M. Verminet," cried he, "has a client
      with him just now. He begs that you will excuse him for a few minutes,
      when he will see you;" and evidently anxious to be civil to the gorgeously
      attired youths before him, he added, "My master is just now engaged with
      M. de Croisenois."
    
    
      "Aha," cried Gaston; "I will lay you ten to one that the dear Marquis will
      be delighted to see me."
    
    
      Andre started on hearing this name, and his cheek crimsoned. The man whom
      he most hated in this world; the wretch who, by his possession of some
      compromising secret, was forcing Sabine into a detested marriage; the
      villain whom he, M. de Breulh, and Madame de Bois Arden had sworn to
      overreach, was within a few paces of him, and that now he should see him
      face to face. Their eyes would meet, and he would hear the tones of the
      scoundrel's voice. His rage and agitation were so intense that it was with
      the utmost difficulty that he concealed it. Luckily for him, Gaston was
      not paying the slightest attention to his companion; for having, at the
      clerk's invitation, taken a chair, he assumed an imposing attitude, which
      struck the shabby young man behind the railing with the deepest
      admiration.
    
    
      "I suppose," said he, in a loud voice, "that you know my dear friend, the
      Marquis?"
    
    
      Andre made some reply, which Gaston interpreted as a negative.
    
    
      "Really," said he, "you know no one, as I told you before. Where
      have you lived? But you must have heard of him? Henri de Croisenois is one
      of my most intimate friends. He owes me over fifty louis that I won of him
      one night at baccarat."
    
    
      Andre was now certain that he had estimated Verminet's character
      correctly, and the relations of the Marquis de Croisenois with this very
      equivocal personage assumed a meaning of great significance to him. He
      felt now that he had gained a clue, a beacon blazed out before him, and he
      saw his way more clearly into the difficult windings of this labyrinth of
      iniquity which he knew that he must penetrate before he gained the secret
      he longed for.
    
    
      He felt like a child playing the game called "Magic Music," when, as the
      seeker nears the hiding place of the article of which he is in search, the
      strains of the piano swell higher and higher. He now found that the boy
      whose master he had become, knew, or said he knew, a good deal of this
      marquis. Why should he not gain some information from him?
    
    
      "Are you really intimate with the Marquis de Croisenois?" asked he.
    
    
      "I should rather think I was," returned Gandelu the younger. "You will see
      that precious sharp. I know all about him, and who the girl is that he is
      ruining himself for, but I mustn't talk about that; mum's the word, you
      know."
    
    
      At that moment the door opened, and the Marquis appeared, followed by
      Verminet.
    
    
      Henri de Croisenois was attired in the most fashionable manner, and formed
      an utter contrast to the flashy dress of Gaston. He was smoking a cigar,
      and mechanically tapping his boots with an elegant walking cane. In a
      moment the features and figure of the Viscount were indelibly photographed
      upon Andre's brain. He particularly noticed his eyes, which had in them a
      half-concealed look of terror, and his face bore the haunted expression of
      a person who expects some terrible blow to fall upon him at any moment.
    
    
      At a little distance the Marquis still seemed young, but a closer
      inspection showed that the man looked even older than he really was, so
      worn and haggard were his mouth and eyes. Nights at the gaming-table and
      the anxiety as to where the fresh supplies should come from to furnish the
      means to prolong his life of debauchery had told heavily upon him. To-day,
      however, he seemed to be in the best temper imaginable, and in the most
      cheerful manner he addressed a few words to Verminet, in conclusion of the
      conversation that had been going on in the inner office.
    
    
      "It is settled then," remarked he, "that I am to have nothing more to do
      with a business with which neither of us has any real concern?"
    
    
      "Just so," answered Verminet.
    
    
      "Very well, then; but remember that any mistake you may make in the other
      affair will be attended with the most serious results."
    
    
      This caution seemed to suggest some new idea to Verminet, for he said
      something in a low voice to his client at which they both laughed.
    
    
      Gaston was fidgeting about, very uneasy at the Marquis having paid no
      attention to him, and he now advanced with a magnificent salutation and a
      friendly wave of the hand. If the Marquis was charmed at meeting Gandelu,
      he concealed his delight in a most wonderful manner. He seemed surprised,
      but not agreeably so; he bent his head, and he extended his gloved hand
      with a negligent, "Ah, pleased to see you." Then without taking any more
      notice of Gaston, he turned on his heel and continued his conversation
      with Verminet.
    
    
      "The worst part is over," said he, "and therefore no time is to be lost.
      You must see Mascarin and Martin Rigal, the banker, to-day."
    
    
      At these words Andre started. Were these people Croisenois' accomplices?
      Certainly he had accomplices on the brain just now, and their names
      remained deeply engraved on the tablets of his memory.
    
    
      "Tantaine was here this morning," observed Verminet, "and told me that his
      master wanted to see me at four this afternoon. Van Klopen will be there
      also. Shall I say a word to him about your fine friend?"
    
    
      "'Pon my soul," remarked the Marquis, shrugging his shoulders, "I had
      nearly forgotten her. There will be a tremendous fuss made, for she will
      be wanting all sorts of things. Speak to Van Klopen certainly, but do not
      bind yourself. Remember that I do not care a bit for the fair Sara."
    
    
      "Quite so; I understand," answered Verminet; "but keep things quiet, and
      do not have any open disturbances."
    
    
      "Of course not. Good morning," and with a bow to the managing director and
      a nod to Gaston, he lunged out of the office, not condescending to take
      the slightest notice of Andre. Verminet invited Andre and Gaston into his
      sanctum, and, taking a seat, motioned to them to do the same. Verminet was
      a decided contrast to his office, which was shabby and dirty, for his
      dress did his tailor credit, and he appeared to be clean. He was neither
      old nor young, and carried his years well. He was fresh and plump, wore
      his whiskers and hair cut in the English fashion, while his sunken eyes
      had no more expression in them than those of a fish.
    
    
      Gandelu was in a hurry to begin.
    
    
      "Let us get to business," said he. "Last week you lent me some money."
    
    
      "Just so. Do you want any more?"
    
    
      "No; I want to return my bills."
    
    
      A cloud passed over Verminet's face.
    
    
      "The first does not fall due until the 15th," remarked he.
    
    
      "No matter; I have the money with me, and I will pay it on you handing
      over the bills to me."
    
    
      "I can't do it."
    
    
      "And why so, pray?"
    
    
      "The bills have passed out of my hands."
    
    
      Gaston could scarcely credit his ears, nor believe in the truth of this
      last statement, and was certainly upset, now knowing what to do.
    
    
      "But," stammered he, "you promised, when I signed those bills, that they
      should never go out of your hands."
    
    
      "I don't say I did not; but one can't always keep to one's promise. I was
      forced to part with them. I wanted money, and so had to discount them."
    
    
      Andre was not at all surprised, for he had anticipated some such
      difficulty; and seeing that Gaston had entirely lost his head, he broke in
      on the conversation.
    
    
      "Excuse me, sir," remarked he; "but it seems to me that there are certain
      circumstances in this case which should have made you keep your promise."
    
    
      Verminet stared at him.
    
    
      "Who have I the honor of speaking to?" asked he, instead of making a
      direct reply.
    
    
      "I am a friend of M. de Gandelu's," returned Andre, thinking it best not
      to give any name.
    
    
      "A confidential friend?"
    
    
      "Entirely so. He had, I think, ten thousand francs from you."
    
    
      "Pardon me, five thousand."
    
    
      Andre turned toward his companion in some surprise.
    
    
      Gaston grew crimson.
    
    
      "What is the meaning of this?" asked the artist.
    
    
      "Can't you see?" whispered Gaston. "I had ten because I wanted the other
      five for Zora."
    
    
      "Oh, indeed," returned Andre, with a slight uplifting of his eyebrows.
      "Well, then, M. Verminet, it was five thousand francs that you lent to my
      young friend here. That was right enough; but what do you say to inducing
      him to forge a signature?"
    
    
      "I! I do such a thing?" answered Verminet. "Why, I did not know that the
      signature was not genuine."
    
    
      This insolent denial aroused the unhappy Gaston from his state of stupor.
    
    
      "This is too much, a deuced deal too much," cried he. "Did you not
      yourself tell me that, for your own security, you must insist upon another
      name in addition to mine? Did you not give me a letter, and say, 'Write a
      signature like the one at the bottom of this, it is that of Martin Rigal,
      the banker in the Rue Montmartre'?"
    
    
      "An utterly false accusation, without a shadow of proof; and remember that
      a libel uttered in the presence of a third party is punishable by law."
    
    
      "And yet, sir," continued Andre, "you did not hesitate for a moment in
      discounting these bills. Have you calculated what terrible results may
      come of this breach of faith on your part?       what will happen if this
      forged signature is presented to M. Martin Rigal?"
    
    
      "Very unlikely. Gandelu is the drawer, Rigal merely the endorser. Bills,
      when due, are always presented to the drawer," returned Verminet
      laconically.
    
    
      Evidently a trap had been laid for Gaston, but the reason was still buried
      in obscurity.
    
    
      "Then," remarked Andre, "we have but one course to pursue: we must trace
      those notes to the hands in which they now are, and take them up."
    
    
      "Quite right."
    
    
      "But to enable us to do so, you must first let us know the name of the
      party who discounted them."
    
    
      "I don't know; I have forgotten," answered Verminet, with a careless wave
      of his hand.
    
    
      "Then," returned Andre, in a low, deep voice of concentrated fury, "let me
      advise you, for your own sake, to make an immediate call upon your powers
      of memory."
    
    
      "Do you threaten me?"
    
    
      "And if you do not succeed in remembering the name or names, the
      consequences may be more serious than you seem to anticipate."
    
    
      Verminet saw that the young painter was in dangerous earnest, and rose
      from his chair, but Andre was too quick for him.
    
    
      "No," said he, placing his back against the door; "you will not leave this
      room until you have done what I require."
    
    
      For fully ten minutes the men stood gazing at each other. Verminet was
      green with terror, while Andre's face, though pale, was firm and
      determined.
    
    
      "If the scoundrel makes any resistance," said he to himself, "I will fling
      him out of the window."
    
    
      "The man is a perfect athlete," thought Verminet, "and looks as if he
      would stick at nothing."
    
    
      Seeing that he had better give in, the managing director took up a bulky
      ledger, and began to turn over the leaves with trembling fingers.
    
    
      Andre saw that he was holding it upside-down.
    
    
      "There it is," cried Verminet at last.
    
    
      "Bills for five thousand francs. Gandelu and Rigal, booked for discount to
      Van Klopen, ladies' tailor."
    
    
      Andre was silent.
    
    
      Why was it that Verminet had suggested Rigal's signature as the one he
      ought to imitate? And why had he handed the bills over to Van Klopen? Was
      it mere chance that had arranged it all? He did not believe it, but felt
      sure that some secret tie united them all together, Verminet, Van Klopen,
      Rigal, and the Marquis de Croisenois.
    
    
      "Do you want anything more?" asked the manager of the Mutual Loan Society.
    
    
      "Are the bills in Van Klopen's hands?"
    
    
      "I can't say."
    
    
      "Never mind, he will have to tell me where they are, if he has not got
      them," returned Andre.
    
    
      They left the house, and as soon as they were again in the street Andre
      took his companion's arm, and hurried him off in the direction of the Rue
      de Grammont.
    
    
      "I don't want to give this thief, Verminet, time to warn Van Klopen of
      what has taken place; I had rather fall upon him with the suddenness of an
      earthquake. Come, let us go to his establishment at once."
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XXIV.
    
    
      THE VANISHING BILLS.
    
    
      Had Andre known a little more of the man he had to deal with, he would
      have learned that no one could fall like an earthquake upon Van Klopen.
      Shut up in the sanctum where he composed the numberless costumes that were
      the wonder and delight of Paris, Van Klopen made as careful arrangements
      to secure himself from the interview as the Turk does to guard the
      approaches to his seraglio; and so Andre and Gandelu were accosted in the
      entrance hall by his stately footmen, clad in gorgeous liveries,
      glittering with gold.
    
    
      "M. van Klopen is of the utmost importance," asserted Andre.
    
    
      "Our master is composing."
    
    
      Entreaties, threats, and even a bribe of one hundred francs were alike
      useless; and Andre, seeing that he was about to be checkmated, was half
      tempted to take the men by the collar and hurl them on one side, but he
      calmed himself, and, already repenting of his violence at Verminet's, he
      determined on a course of submission, and so meekly followed the footmen
      into the famous waiting-room, styled by Van Klopen his purgatory. The
      footmen, however, had spoken the truth, for several ladies of the highest
      rank and standing were awaiting the return of this arbiter elegantiarum.
      All of them turned as the young men entered       all save one, who was
      gazing out of the window, drawing with her pretty fingers on the window
      panes. Andre recognized her in an instant as Madame de Bois Arden.
    
    
      "Is it possible?" thought he. "Can the Countess have returned here after
      what has occurred?"
    
    
      Gaston felt that five charming pairs of eyes were fixed upon him, and
      studied to assume his most graceful posture.
    
    
      After a brief time given to arrangement, Andre grew disgusted.
    
    
      "I wish that she would look round," said he to himself. "I think she would
      feel rather ashamed. I will say a word to her."
    
    
      He rose from his chair, and, without thinking how terribly he might
      compromise the lady, he took up a position at her side. She was, however,
      intently watching something that was going on in the street, and did not
      turn her head.
    
    
      "Madame," said he.
    
    
      She started, and, as she turned and recognized Andre, she uttered a little
      cry of surprise.
    
    
      "Great heavens! is that you?"
    
    
      "Yes, it is I."
    
    
      "And here? I dare say that my presence in this place surprises you," she
      went on, "and that I have a short memory, and no feelings of pride."
    
    
      Andre made no reply, and his silence was a sufficient rejoinder to the
      question.
    
    
      "You do me a great injustice," muttered the Countess. "I am here because
      De Breulh told me that in your interests I ought to pardon Van Klopen, and
      go to him again as I used to do; so you see, M. Andre, that it is never
      safe to judge by appearance, and a woman more than anything else."
    
    
      "Will you forgive me?" asked Andre earnestly.
    
    
      The lady interrupted him by a little wave of her hand, invisible to all
      save to him, which clearly said,       
    
    
      "Take care; we are not alone."
    
    
      She once more turned her eyes towards the street, and he mechanically did
      the same. By this means their faces were hidden from observation.
    
    
      "De Breulh," went on the lady, "has heard a good deal about De Croisenois,
      and, as no doubt you can guess, but very little to his credit, and quite
      enough to justify any father in refusing him his daughter's hand; but in
      this case it is evident to me that De Mussidan is yielding to a secret
      pressure. We must ferret out some hidden crime in De Croisenois' past
      which will force him to withdraw his proposal."
    
    
      "I shall find one," muttered Andre.
    
    
      "But remember there is no time to be lost. According to our agreement, I
      treat him in the most charming manner, and he thinks that I am entirely
      devoted to his interests, and to-morrow I have arranged to introduce him
      to the Count and Countess at the Hotel de Mussidan, where the Count and
      Countess have agreed to receive him."
    
    
      Andre started at this news.
    
    
      "I saw," continued the lady, "that you were quite right in the opinion you
      had formed, for in the first place the common danger has almost reconciled
      the Count and Countess affectionately to each other, though it is
      notorious that they have always lived in the most unhappy manner. Their
      faces are careworn and full of anxiety, and they watch every movement of
      Sabine with eager eyes. I think that they look upon her as a means of
      safety, but shudder at the sacrifice she is making on their account."
    
    
      "And Sabine?"
    
    
      "Her conduct is perfectly sublime, and she is ready to consummate the
      sacrifice without a murmur. Her self-sacrificing devotion is perfectly
      admirable; but what is more admirable still is the way in which she
      conceals the suffering that she endures from her parents. Noble-hearted
      girl! she is calm and silent, but she has always been so. She has grown
      thinner, and perhaps her cheek is a trifle paler, but her forehead was
      burning and seemed to scorch my lips as I kissed her. With this exception,
      however, there was nothing else about her that would betray her tortures.
      Modeste, her maid, told me, moreover, that when night came she seemed
      utterly worn out, and the poor girl, with tears in her eyes, declared
      'that her dear mistress was killing herself.'"
    
    
      Andre's eyes overflowed with tears.
    
    
      "What have I done to deserve such love?" asked he.
    
    
      A door suddenly opened, and Andre and the Viscountess turned hastily at
      the sound. It was Van Klopen who came in, crying, according to his usual
      custom,       
    
    
      "Well, and whose turn is it next?"
    
    
      When, however, he saw Gaston, his face grew white, and it was with a smile
      that he stepped towards him, motioning back the lady whose turn it was,
      and who protested loudly against this injustice.
    
    
      "Ah, M. de Gandelu," said he, "you have come, I suppose, to bespeak some
      fresh toilettes for that exquisite creature, Zora de Chantemille?"
    
    
      "Not to-day," returned Gaston. "Zora is a little indisposed."
    
    
      Andre, however, who had arranged the narrative that he was about to pour
      into the ears of the famous Van Klopen, was in too much haste to permit of
      any unnecessary delay.
    
    
      "We have come here," said he hurriedly, "upon a matter of some moment. My
      friend, M. Gaston de Gandelu, is about to leave Paris for some months,
      and, before doing so, is anxious to settle all outstanding accounts, and
      retire all his bills, which may not yet have fallen due."
    
    
      "Have I any bills of M. de Gandelu?" said Van Klopen slowly. "Ah, yes, I
      remember that I had some now. Yes, five bills of one thousand francs each,
      drawn by Gandelu, and accepted by Martin Rigal. I received them from the
      Mutual Loan Society, but they are no longer in my hands."
    
    
      "Is that the case?" murmured Gaston, growing sick with apprehension.
    
    
      "Yes, I sent them to my cloth merchants at St. Etienne, Rollon and
      Company."
    
    
      Van Klopen was a clever scoundrel, but he sometimes lacked the necessary
      perception of when he had said enough; and this was proved to-day, for,
      agitated by the steady gaze that Andre kept upon him, he added,       
    
    
      "If you do not believe my word, I can show you the acknowledgment that I
      received from that firm."
    
    
      "It is unnecessary," replied Andre. "Your statement is quite sufficient."
    
    
      "I should prefer to let you see the letter."
    
    
      "No, thank you," replied Andre, not for a moment duped by the game that
      was being played. "Pray take no more trouble. We shall, I presume, find
      that the bills are at St. Etienne. There is no use in taking any more
      trouble about them, and we will wait until they arrive at maturity. I have
      the honor to wish you good morning."
    
    
      And with these words he dragged away Gaston, who was actually about to
      consult Van Klopen as to the most becoming costume for Zora to appear in
      on leaving the prison of St. Lazare. When they were a few doors from the
      man-milliner's, Andre stopped and wrote down the names of Van Klopen's
      cloth merchants. Gaston was now quite at his ease.
    
    
      "I think," remarked he, "that Van Klopen is a sharp fellow; he knows that
      I am to be relied on."
    
    
      "Where do you think your bills are?"
    
    
      "At St. Etienne's, of course."
    
    
      The perfect innocence of the boy elicited from Andre a gesture of
      impatient commiseration.
    
    
      "Listen to me," said he, "and see if you can comprehend the awful position
      in which you have placed yourself."
    
    
      "I am listening, my dear fellow; pray go on."
    
    
      "You drew these bills through Verminet because Van Klopen would not give
      you credit."
    
    
      "Exactly so."
    
    
      "How, then, do you account for the fact that this man, who was at first
      disinclined to trust you, should without rhyme or reason, offer to supply
      you now as he did to-day?"
    
    
      "The deuce! That never struck me. It does seem queer. Does he want to play
      me a nasty trick? But which of them is it       Verminet or Van Klopen?"
    
    
      "It is plain to me that the pair of them have entered into a pleasant
      little plot to blackmail you."
    
    
      Young Gandelu did not at all like this turn, and he exclaimed,       
    
    
      "Blackmail me, indeed! why, I know my way about better than that. They
      won't get much out of me, I can tell you."
    
    
      Andre shrugged his shoulders.
    
    
      "Then," said he, "just tell me what you intend to say to Verminet when he
      comes to you upon the day your bills fall due, and says to you, 'Give me
      one hundred thousand francs for these five little bits of paper, or I go
      straight to your father with them'?"
    
    
      "I should say, of course       ah, well, I really do not know what I
      should say."
    
    
      "You could say nothing, except that you had been imposed on in the most
      infamous way. You would plead for time, and Verminet would give it to you
      if you would execute a deed insuring him one hundred thousand francs on
      the day you came of age."
    
    
      "A hundred thousand devils are all the rogue would get from me. That's the
      way I do things, do you see? If people try and ride roughshod over me, I
      merely hit out, and then just look out for broken bones. Pay this chap?
      Not I! I know the governor would make an almighty shine, but I'll choose
      that sooner than be had like that."
    
    
      He was quite serious but could only put his feelings into the language he
      usually spoke.
    
    
      "I think," answered Andre, "that your father would forgive this
      imprudence, but that it will be even harder for him to do so than it was
      to send a doctor to number the hours he had to live. He will forgive you
      because he is your father, and because he loves you; but Verminet, when he
      finds that the threat to go to your father does not appall you, will
      menace you with criminal proceedings."
    
    
      "Hulloo!" said Gandelu, stopping short. "I say, that is very poor fun,"
      gasped he.
    
    
      "There is no fun in it, for such fun, when brought to the notice of a
      court of justice, goes by the ugly name of forgery, and forgery means a
      swinging heavy sentence."
    
    
      Gaston turned pale, and trembled from head to foot.
    
    
      "Tried and sentenced," faltered he. "No, I don't believe you, but I hold
      no honors and will turn up my cards." He quite forgot that he was in the
      public street, and was talking at the top of his shrill falsetto voice,
      and gesticulating violently.
    
    
      "The poor old governor, I might have made him so happy, and, after all, I
      have only been a torment to him. Ah, could I but begin once more; but then
      the cards are dealt, and I must go on with the game, and I have made a
      nice muddle of the whole thing before I am twenty years of age; but no
      criminal courts for me, no, the easiest way out of it is a pistol shot,
      for I am an honest man's son, and I will not bring more disgrace on him
      than I have already done."
    
    
      "Do you really mean what you say?" asked Andre.
    
    
      "Of course I do. I can be firm enough sometimes."
    
    
      "Then we will not despair yet," answered the young painter. "I think that
      we shall be able to settle this ugly business, but you cannot be too
      cautious. Keep indoors, and remember that I may have urgent need of you at
      almost any time of day or night."
    
    
      "I agree, but remember this, Zora is not to be forgotten."
    
    
      "Don't fret over that; I will call and see her to-morrow. And now,
      farewell for to-day, as I have not an instant to lose," and with these
      words Andre hurried off.
    
    
      Andre's reason for haste was that he had caught a few words addressed by
      Verminet to Croisenois       "I shall see Mascarin at four o'clock." And
      he determined to loiter about the Rue St. Anne, and watch the Managing
      Director when he came out, and so find out who this Mascarin was, who he
      was certain was mixed up in the plot. He darted down the Rue de Grammont
      like an arrow from a bow, and as the clock in a neighboring belfry chimed
      half-past three, he was in the Rue St. Anne. There was a small wine-shop
      almost opposite to the office of the Mutual Loan Society, and there Andre
      ensconced himself and made a frugal meal, while he was waiting for
      Verminet's appearance, and just as he had finished his light refreshment
      he saw the man he wanted come out of the office, and crept cautiously
      after him like a Red Indian on the trail of his enemy.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XXV.
    
    
      THE SPY.
    
    
      As Verminet swaggered down the street he had the air of a successful man,
      of a capitalist, in short, and the Managing Director of a highly lucrative
      concern. Andre had no difficulty in following his man, though detective's
      business was quite new to him, which is no such easy matter, although
      every one thinks that he can become one. Andre kept his man in sight, and
      was astonished at the numerous acquaintances that Verminet seemed to have.
      Occasionally he said to himself, "Perhaps I am mistaken after all, for
      fancy is a bad pair of spectacles to see through. This man may be honest,
      and I have let my imagination lead me astray."
    
    
      Meanwhile, Verminet who had reached the Boulevard Poisonniere, assumed a
      totally different air, throwing off his old manner as he cast away his
      cigar. When he had reached the Rue Montorgueil he turned underneath a
      large archway. Verminet had gone into the office of M. B. Mascarin, and
      that person simply kept a Servants' Registry Office for domestics of both
      sexes. In spite of his surprise, however, he determined to wait for
      Verminet to come out; and, not to give himself the air of loitering about
      the place, he crossed the road and appeared to be interested in watching
      three workmen who were engaged in fixing the revolving shutters to a new
      shop window. Luckily for the young painter he had not to wait a very long
      while, for in less than a quarter of an hour Verminet came out,
      accompanied by two men. The one was tall and thin, and wore a pair of
      spectacles with colored glasses, while the other was stout and ruddy, with
      the unmistakable air of a man of the world about him. Andre would have
      given the twenty thousand francs which he still had in his pocket if he
      could have heard a single word of their conversation. He was moving
      skilfully forward so as to place himself within earshot, when not two feet
      from him he heard a shrill whistle twice repeated. There was something so
      strange and curious in the sound of this whistle that Andre looked round
      and noticed that the three men whom he was watching had been also
      attracted by it. The tall man with the colored glasses glanced
      suspiciously around him, and then after a nod to his companions turned and
      re-entered the office, while Verminet and the other walked away arm in
      arm. Andre was undecided; should he try and discover who these two men
      were? Near the entrance he saw a lad selling hot chestnuts. "Ah!" said he,
      "the little chestnut seller will always be there; but I may lose the
      others if I stay here." He followed the two men as quickly as possible.
      They did not go very far, and speedily entered a fine house in the Rue
      Montmartre. Here Andre was for a moment puzzled, as he did not know to
      whom they were paying a visit, but noticing an inscription on the wall of
      "Cashier's Office on the first floor," he exclaimed,       
    
    
      "Ah! it is to the banker's they have gone!"
    
    
      He questioned a man coming downstairs and heard that M. Martin Rigal, the
      banker, had his offices and residence there.
    
    
      "I have struck a vein of good luck to-day," thought he; "and now if my
      little friend the chestnut seller can only tell me the names of these men,
      I have done a good day's work. I do hope that he has not gone."
    
    
      The boy was still there, and he had two customers standing by the
      chafing-dish which contained the glowing charcoal, and a working lad in
      cap and blouse was arguing so hotly with the lad that they did not notice
      Andre's appearance.
    
    
      "You can stow that chat," said the boy; "I have told your father the price
      I would take. You want my station and stock-in-trade. Hand over two
      hundred and fifty francs, and they are yours."
    
    
      "But my dad will only give two hundred," returned the other.
    
    
      "Then he don't need give nothing, for he won't get 'em," answered the
      chestnut vender sharply. "Two hundred francs for a pitch like this! Why, I
      have sometimes taken ten francs and more, and that ain't a lie, on the
      word of Toto Chupin."
    
    
      Andre was tickled with this strange designation, and addressed himself to
      the lad who bore it.
    
    
      "My good boy," said he, "I think you were here an hour ago. Did you see
      anything of three gentlemen who came out of the house and stood talking
      together for a short time?"
    
    
      The lad turned sharply round and examined his questioner from tip to toe
      with an air of the most supreme impertinence; and then, in a tone which
      matched his look, replied,       
    
    
      "What does it signify to you who they are? Mind your own business, and be
      off!"
    
    
      Andre had had some little experience of this delightful class of street
      arab, of which Toto Chupin was so favorable a specimen, and knew their
      habits, customs, and language.
    
    
      "Come, my chicken," said he, "spit it out, it won't blister your tongue,
      to answer a man who asks a civil question."
    
    
      "Well, then, I saw 'em, sharp enough, and what then?"
    
    
      "Why, that I should like to have their names if they have such an article
      belonging to 'em!"
    
    
      Toto raised his cap and scratched his head, as if to stimulate his brains,
      and as he brushed up his thick head of dirty yellow hair, he eyed Andre
      cunningly.
    
    
      "And suppose I know the blokes' names and tells 'em out to you, what will
      you stand?" asked he.
    
    
      "Ten sous."
    
    
      The delightful youth puffed out his cheeks, then expelled the pent-up wind
      by a sudden slap, as a mark of his disgust at the meanness of the offer.
    
    
      "Pull up your braces, my lord," said he sarcastically, "or you'll be
      losing the contents of your breeches pockets. Ten sous, indeed! Perhaps
      you'd like me to lend 'em to yer?"
    
    
      Andre smiled pleasantly.
    
    
      "Did you think, my little man, that I was going to offer you twenty
      thousand shiners?" asked he.
    
    
      "Won again!" cried Toto; "I laid myself a new hat that you weren't a fool,
      and I have collared the stakes."
    
    
      "Why do you think I am not a fool?"
    
    
      "Because a fool would have begun by offering me five francs and gone up
      slick to ten, while you began at a modest figure."
    
    
      The painter smiled.
    
    
      "But you were too old a bird to be caught like that," continued the lad;
      and as he spoke, he stopped, and contracted his brow as if in deep
      perplexity. Of course he was acquainted with the names, but ought he to
      give them? Instantly he scented an enemy. Harmless people did not usually
      ask questions of itinerant chestnut venders, and to open his mouth might
      be to injure Mascarin, Beaumarchef, or the guileless Tantaine.
    
    
      This last thought determined the lad.
    
    
      "Keep your ten sous, my pippin," said the boy; "I'll tell you what you
      want to know all gratis and for nothing, because I've taken a real fancy
      to the cut of your mug. The tall chap was Mascarin, the fat un Doctor
      Hortebise, and t'other       stop, let me think it out in my knowledge
      box; ah! I have it, he was Verminet."
    
    
      Andre was so delighted that, drawing from his pocket a five-franc piece,
      he tossed it to the boy.
    
    
      "Thanks, my noble lord," said Chupin, and was about to add something more
      in a similar vein, when he glanced down the street. His look changed in an
      instant, and he fixed his eyes upon the painter's face with a very strange
      expression.
    
    
      "What is the matter, my lad?" asked Andre, surprised at this sudden
      change.
    
    
      "Nothing," answered Chupin; "nothing at all; only as you seem a decentish
      sort of chap, I should recommend you to keep your wits about you, and to
      look out for squalls."
    
    
      "Eh, what do you mean?"
    
    
      "I mean       why       be careful, of course. Hang me if I exactly know
      what I do mean. It is just an idea that came to me all of a jump. But
      there, be off; I ain't going to say another word."
    
    
      With much difficulty Andre repressed his astonishment. He saw that this
      young scamp was the possessor of many secrets which might be of
      inestimable value to him; but he also saw that he was determined to hold
      his tongue, and that it would at present be a waste of time to try and get
      anything out of him; and an empty cab passing at this moment, Andre hailed
      it, and told the coachman to drive fast to the Champs Elysees. In
      obedience to the warning that he had just received from Toto, he did not
      give the name of the café where he was to meet De Breulh, for he
      made up his mind to be careful, yes, extremely careful. He recollected the
      two odd whistles which had seemed to make Mascarin wince, and which
      certainly broke off the conference of the three men, and he remembered
      that it was after a glance down the street that Toto had become less
      communicative and had given him that curt warning. "By heaven," said he,
      as the recollection of a story he had read not long ago dawned on him, "I
      am being followed." He lowered the front glass of the cab, and attracted
      the coachman's attention by pulling him by the sleeve.
    
    
      "Listen to me," said he, as the man turned, "and do not slacken your
      speed. Here, take your five francs in advance."
    
    
      "But look here              "
    
    
      "Listen to me. Go as sharp as you can to the Rue de Matignon; turn down
      it, and, as you do, go a bit slower; then drive on like lightning, and
      when you are in the Champs Elysees do what you like, for your cab will be
      empty."
    
    
      The driver chuckled.
    
    
      "Aha," said he; "I see you are being followed, and you want to give 'em
      leg bail."
    
    
      "Yes, yes; you are right."
    
    
      "Then listen to me. Take care when you jump, and don't do it on the
      pavement, for t'other is the safest."
    
    
      Andre succeeded in alighting safely, and turned down a narrow court before
      his pursuer had entered the street; but it was vain for the young painter
      to lurk in a doorway, for after five minutes had elapsed there was nothing
      to be seen, and no spy had made his appearance.
    
    
      "I have been over-cautious," muttered he.
    
    
      More than a quarter of an hour had elapsed, and Andre felt that he might
      leave his hiding-place, and go in quest of De Breulh; and as he approached
      the spot chosen for their meeting-place, he saw his friend's carriage, and
      near it was the owner, smoking a cigar. The two men caught sight of each
      other almost at the same moment. De Breulh advanced to greet the young man
      with extended hand.
    
    
      "I have been waiting for you for the last twenty minutes," said he.
    
    
      Andre commenced to apologize, but his friend checked him.
    
    
      "Never mind," returned he; "I know that you must have had some excellent
      reasons; but, to tell you the honest truth, I had become rather nervous
      about you."
    
    
      "Nervous! and why, pray?"
    
    
      "Do you not recollect what I said the other evening? De Croisenois is a
      double-dyed scoundrel."
    
    
      Andre remained silent, and his friend, putting his arm affectionately
      through his, continued,       
    
    
      "Let us walk," said he; "it is better than sitting down in the café.
      I believe De Croisenois capable of anything. He had the prospect before
      him of a large fortune,       that of his brother George; but this he has
      already anticipated. A man in a position like this is not to be trifled
      with."
    
    
      "I do not fear him."
    
    
      "But I do. I am, however, a little relieved by the fact that he has never
      seen you."
    
    
      The painter shook his head.
    
    
      "Not only has he seen me, but I half believe that he suspects my designs."
    
    
      "Impossible!"
    
    
      "But I am sure that I have been followed to-day. I have no actual proof,
      but still I am fully convinced that it was so."
    
    
      And Andre recounted all that had occurred during the day.
    
    
      "You are certainly being watched," answered De Breulh, "and every step
      that you take will be known to your enemies, and at this very moment
      perhaps eyes are upon us."
    
    
      As he spoke he glanced uneasily around; but it was quite dark, and he
      could see no one.
    
    
      "We will give the spies a little gentle exercise," said he, "and if we
      dine together they will find it hard to discover the place."
    
    
      De Breulh's coachman was dozing on the driving-seat. His master aroused
      him, and whispered some order in his ear. The two young men then got in,
      and the carriage started at a quick pace.
    
    
      "What do you think of this expedient?" asked De Breulh. "We shall go at
      this pace for the next hour. We will then alight at the corner of the
      Chaussee d'Autin, and be free for the rest of the night, and those who
      wish to follow us to-night must have good eyes and legs."
    
    
      All came to pass as De Breulh had arranged; but as he jumped out he saw a
      dark form slip from behind the carriage and mingle with the crowd on the
      Boulevard.
    
    
      "By heavens," said he; "that was a man. I thought that I was throwing a
      spy off the track, and I was in reality only treating him to a drive."
    
    
      To make sure, he took off his glove and felt the springs of the carriage.
    
    
      "See," said he, "they are still warm from the contact with a human body."
    
    
      The young painter was silent, but all was now explained: while he jumped
      from the cab, his tracker had been carried away upon it. This discovery
      saddened the dinner, and a little after ten Andre left his friend and
      returned home.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XXVI.
    
    
      MASCARIN MOVES.
    
    
      The Viscountess de Bois Arden had not been wrong when she told Andre in
      Van Klopen's establishment that community of sorrow had brought the Count
      and Countess of Mussidan nearer together, and that Sabine had made up her
      mind to sacrifice herself for the honor of the family. Unfortunately,
      however, this change in the relations of husband and wife had not taken
      place immediately; for after her interview with Doctor Hortebise, Diana's
      first impulse had not been to go to her husband, but to write to Norbert,
      who was as much compromised by the correspondence as she herself. Her
      first letter did not elicit a reply. She wrote a second, and then a third,
      in which, though she did not go into details, she let the Duke know that
      she was the victim of a dark intrigue, and that a deadly peril was hanging
      over her daughter's head. This last letter was brought back to her by the
      messenger, without any envelope, and across it Norbert had written,       
    
    
      "The weapon which you have used against me has now been turned against
      yourself. Heaven is just."
    
    
      These words started up in letters of fire before her eyes as the presage
      of coming misfortune, and telling her that the hour of retribution had now
      come, and that she must be prepared to suffer, as an atonement for her
      crimes. Then it was that she felt all was lost, and she must go to her
      husband for aid, unless she desired that copies of the stolen letters
      should be sent to him; and in a little boudoir, adjoining Sabine's own
      room, she opened her heart and told her husband all. She performed it with
      all the skill of a woman who, without descending to falsehood, contrives
      to conceal the truth. But she could not hide the share that she had taken,
      both in the death of the late Duke of Champdoce and the disappearance of
      George de Croisenois.
    
    
      The Count's brain reeled. He called up to his memory what Diana had been
      when he first saw and loved her at Laurebourg: how pure and modest she
      looked! what virginal candor sat upon her brow! and yet she was even then
      doing her best to urge on a son to murder his father.
    
    
      De Mussidan had had hideous doubts concerning the relations of Norbert and
      Diana, both before and after marriage; but his wife firmly denied this at
      the moment when she was revealing the other guilty secrets of her past
      life. He had believed that Sabine was not his child, and now he had to
      reproach himself with the indifference he had displayed towards her.
    
    
      He made no answer to the terrible revelation that was poured into his
      ears; but when the Countess had concluded, he rose and left the room,
      stretching out his hands and grasping the walls for support, like a
      drunken man.
    
    
      The Count and Countess believed that Sabine had slept through this
      interview, but they were mistaken, for Sabine had heard all those fatal
      words       "ruin, dishonor, and despair!" At first she scarcely
      understood. Were not these words merely the offspring of her delirium? She
      strove to shake it off, but too soon she knew that the whispered words
      were sad realities, and she lay on her bed quivering with terror. Much of
      the conversation escaped her, but she heard enough. Her mother's past sins
      were to be exposed if the daughter did not marry a man entirely unknown to
      her       the Marquis de Croisenois. She knew that her torments would not
      be of very long duration, for to part with her love for Andre would be to
      part with life itself. She made up her mind to live until she had saved
      her parents' honor by the sacrifice of herself, and then she would be free
      to accept the calm repose of the grave.
    
    
      But the terrible revelation bore its fruits, for her fever came back, and
      a relapse was the result. But youth and a sound constitution gained the
      day, and when she was convalescent her will was as strong as ever.
    
    
      Her first act was to write the letter to her lover which had driven him to
      the verge of distraction; and then, fearing lest her father might, in his
      agony and remorse, be driven to some rash act, she went to him and told
      him that she knew all.
    
    
      "I never loved M. de Breulh," said she with a pitiful smile, "and
      therefore the sacrifice is not so great after all."
    
    
      The Count was not for a moment the dupe of the generous-souled girl, but
      he did not dare to brave the scandal of the death of Montlouis, and still
      less the exposure of his wife's conduct. Time was passing, however, and
      the miscreants in whose power they were made no signs of life. Hortebise
      did not appear any more, and there were moments when the miserable Diana
      actually ventured to hope. "Have they forgotten us?" thought she.
    
    
      Alas! no; they were people who never forgot.
    
    
      The Champdoce affair had been satisfactorily arranged, and every
      precaution had been taken to prevent the detection of Paul as an impostor,
      and engaged as he had been, Mascarin had no time to turn his attention to
      the marriage of Sabine and De Croisenois. The famous Limited Company, with
      the Marquis as chairman, had, too, to be started, the shares of which were
      to be taken up by the unhappy victims of the blackmailers; but first some
      decided steps must be taken with the Mussidans, and Tantaine was
      dispatched on this errand.
    
    
      This amiable individual, though he was going into such very excellent
      society, did not consider it necessary to make any improvement in his
      attire. This was the reason why the footman, upon seeing such a shabby
      visitor and hearing him ask for the Count or Countess, did not hesitate to
      reply, with a sneer, that his master and mistress had been out for some
      months, and were not likely to return for a week or two. This fact did not
      disconcert the wily man, for drawing one of Mascarin's cards from his
      pocket, he begged the kind gentleman to take it upstairs, when he was sure
      that he would at once be sent for.
    
    
      De Mussidan, when he read the name on the card, turned ghastly pale.
    
    
      "Show him into the library," said he curtly.
    
    
      Florestan left the room, and the Count mutely handed the card to his wife,
      but she had no need to read it.
    
    
      "I can tell what it is," gasped she.
    
    
      "The day for settling accounts has come," said the Count, "and this name
      is the fatal sign."
    
    
      The Countess flung herself upon her knees, and taking the hand that hung
      placidly by his side, pressed her lips tenderly to it.
    
    
      "Forgive me, Octave!" she muttered. "Will you not forgive me? I am a
      miserable wretch, and why did not Heaven punish me for the sins that I
      have committed, and not make others expiate my offences?"
    
    
      The Count put her gently aside. He suffered intensely, and yet no word of
      reproach escaped his lips against the woman who had ruined his whole life.
    
    
      "And Sabine," she went on, "must she, a De Mussidan, marry one of these
      wretched scoundrels?"
    
    
      Sabine was the only one in the room who preserved her calmness; she had so
      schooled herself that her distress of mind was not apparent to the outward
      eye.
    
    
      "Do not make yourselves miserable," said she, with a faint smile; "how do
      we know that M. de Croisenois may not make me an excellent husband after
      all?"
    
    
      The Count gazed upon his daughter with a look of the fondest affection and
      gratitude.
    
    
      "Dearest Sabine!" murmured he. Her fortitude had restored his
      self-command. "Let us be outwardly resigned," said he, "whatever our
      feelings may be. Time may do much for us, and at the very church door we
      may find means of escape."
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XXVII.
    
    
      A CRUEL SLUR.
    
    
      Florestan had conducted Tantaine to the sumptuous library, in which the
      Count had received Mascarin's visit; and, to pass away the time, the old
      man took a mental inventory of the contents of the room. He tried the
      texture of the curtains, looked at the handsome bindings of the books, and
      admired the magnificent bronzes on the mantelpiece.
    
    
      "Aha," muttered he, as he tried the springs of a luxurious armchair,
      "everything is of the best, and when matters are settled, I half think
      that I should like a resting-place just like this              "
    
    
      He checked himself, for the door opened, and the Count made his
      appearance, calm and dignified, but very pale. Tantaine made a low bow,
      pressing his greasy hat against his breast.
    
    
      "Your humble servant to command," said he.
    
    
      The Count had come to a sudden halt.
    
    
      "Excuse me," said he, "but did you send up a card asking for an
      interview?"
    
    
      "I am not Mascarin certainly, but I used that highly respectable
      gentleman's name, because I knew that my own was totally unknown to you. I
      am Tantaine, Adrien Tantaine."
    
    
      M. de Mussidan gazed with extreme surprise upon the squalid individual
      before him. His mild and benevolent face inspired confidence, and yet he
      doubted him.
    
    
      "I have come on the same business," pursued the old man. "I have been
      ordered to tell you that it must be hurried on."
    
    
      The Count hastily closed the door and locked it; the manner of this man
      made him feel even too plainly the ignominy of his position.
    
    
      "I understand," answered he. "But how is it that you have come, and not
      the other one?"
    
    
      "He intended to come; but at the last moment he drew back; Mascarin, you
      see, has a great deal to lose, while I              " He paused, and
      holding up the tattered tails of his coat, turned round, as though to
      exhibit his shabby attire. "All my property is on my back," continued he.
    
    
      "Then I can treat with you?" asked the Count.
    
    
      Tantaine nodded his head. "Yes, Count, I have the missing leaves from the
      Baron's journal, and also, well       I suppose you know everything, all
      of your wife's correspondence."
    
    
      "Enough," answered the Count, unable to hide his disgust. "Sit down."
    
    
      "Now, Count, I will go to the point       are you going to put the police
      on us?"
    
    
      "I have said that I would do nothing of the kind."
    
    
      "Then we can get to business."
    
    
      "Yes, if              "
    
    
      The old man shrugged his shoulders.
    
    
      "There is no 'if' in the case," returned he. "We state our conditions, for
      acceptance or rejection."
    
    
      These words were uttered in a tone of such extreme insolence that the
      Count was strongly tempted to hurl the extortionate scoundrel from the
      window, but he contrived to restrain his passion.
    
    
      "Let us hear the conditions then," said he impatiently.
    
    
      Tantaine extracted from some hidden recess of his coat a much-worn
      pocketbook, and drew from it a paper.
    
    
      "Here are our conditions," returned he slowly. "The Count de Mussidan
      promises to give the hand of his daughter to Henri Marquis de Croisenois.
      He will give his daughter a wedding portion of six hundred thousand
      francs, and promises that the marriage shall take place without delay. The
      Marquis de Croisenois will be formally introduced at your house, and he
      must be cordially received. Four days afterwards he must be asked to
      dinner. On the fifteenth day from that M. de Mussidan will give a grand
      ball in honor of the signing of the marriage contract. The leaves from the
      diary and the whole of the correspondence will be handed to M. de Mussidan
      as soon as the civil ceremony is completed."
    
    
      With firmly compressed lips and clenched hands, the Count sat listening to
      these conditions.
    
    
      "And who can tell me," said he, "that you will keep your engagements, and
      that these papers will be restored to me at all?"
    
    
      Tantaine looked at him with a air of pity.
    
    
      "Your own good sense," answered he. "What more could we expect to get out
      of you than your daughter and your money?"
    
    
      The Count did not answer, but paced up and down the room, eyeing the
      ambassador keenly, and endeavoring to detect some weak point in his manner
      of cynicism and audacity. Then speaking in the calm tone of a man who had
      made up his mind, he said,       
    
    
      "You hold me as in a vice, and I admit myself vanquished. Stringent as
      your conditions are, I accept them."
    
    
      "That is the right style of way to talk in," remarked Tantaine cheerfully.
    
    
      "Then," continued the Count, with a ray of hope gleaming in his face, "why
      should I give my daughter to De Croisenois at all?       surely this is
      utterly unnecessary. What you want is simply six hundred thousand francs;
      well, you can have them, and leave me Sabine."
    
    
      He paused and waited for the reply, believing that the day was his; but he
      was wrong.
    
    
      "That would not be the same thing at all," answered Tantaine. "We should
      not gain our ends by such means."
    
    
      "I can do more," said the Count. "Give me six months, and I will add a
      million to the sum I have already offered."
    
    
      Tantaine did not appear impressed by the magnitude of this offer. "I
      think," remarked he, "that it will be better to close this interview,
      which, I confess, is becoming a little annoying. You agreed to accept the
      conditions. Are you still in that mind?"
    
    
      The Count bowed. He could not trust himself to speak.
    
    
      "Then," went on Tantaine, "I will take my leave. Remember, that as you
      fulfil your engagement, so we will keep to ours."
    
    
      He had laid his hand on the handle of the door, when the Count said,       
    
    
      "Another word, if you please. I can answer for myself and Madame de
      Mussidan, but how about my daughter?"
    
    
      Tantaine's face changed. "What do you mean?" asked he.
    
    
      "My daughter may refuse to accept M. de Croisenois."
    
    
      "Why should she? He is good-looking, pleasant, and agreeable."
    
    
      "Still she may refuse him."
    
    
      "If mademoiselle makes any objection," said the old man in peremptory
      accents, "you must let me see her for a few minutes, and after that you
      will have no further difficulty with her."
    
    
      "Why, what could you have to say to my daughter?"
    
    
      "I should say              "
    
    
      "Well, what would you say?"
    
    
      "I should say that if she loves any one, it is not M. de Breulh." He
      endeavored to pass through the half-opened door, but the Count closed it
      violently.
    
    
      "You shall not leave this room," cried he, "until you have explained this
      insulting remark."
    
    
      "I had no intention of offending you," answered Tantaine humbly. "I only              "
      He paused, and then, with an air of sarcasm which sat strangely upon a
      person of his appearance, went on, "I am aware that the heiress of a noble
      family may do many things without having her reputation compromised, when
      girls in a lower social grade would be forever lost by the commission of
      any one of them; and I am sure if the family of M. de Breulh knew that the
      young lady to whom he was engaged had been in the habit of passing her
      afternoons alone with a young man in his studio              "
    
    
      He paused, and hastily drew a revolver, for it seemed to him as if the
      Count were about to throw himself upon him. "Softly, softly, if you
      please," cried he. "Blows and insults are fatal mistakes. I have better
      information than yourself, that is all. I have more than ten times seen
      your daughter enter a house in the Rue Tour d'Auvergne, and asking for M.
      Andre, creep silently up the staircase."
    
    
      The Count felt that he was choking. He tore off his cravat, and cried
      wildly, "Proofs! Give me proofs!"
    
    
      During the last five minutes Tantaine had shifted his ground so skilfully
      that the heavy library table now stood between himself and the Count, and
      he was comparatively safe behind this extemporized defence.
    
    
      "Proofs?" answered he. "Do you think that I carry them about with me? In a
      week I could give you the lovers' correspondence. That, you will say, is
      too long to wait; but you can set your doubts at rest at once. If you go
      to the address I will give you before eight to-morrow morning, and enter
      the rooms occupied by M. Andre, you will find the portrait of Mademoiselle
      Sabine carefully concealed from view behind a green curtain, and a very
      good portrait it is. I presume you will admit that it could not have been
      executed without a sitting."
    
    
      "Leave this," cried the Count, "without a moment's delay."
    
    
      Tantaine did not wait for a repetition of these words. He passed through
      the doorway, and as soon as he was outside he called out in cheerful
      accents. "Do not forget the address, Number 45, Rue Tour d'Auvergne, name
      of Andre, and mind and be there before eight a.m."
    
    
      The Count made a rush at him on hearing this last insult, but he was too
      late, for Tantaine slammed the door, and was in the hall before the
      infuriated master of the house could open it. Tantaine had resumed all his
      airs of humility, and took off his hat to the footmen as he descended the
      steps. "Yes," muttered he, as he walked along, "the idea was a happy one.
      Andre knows that he is watched, and will be careful; and now that M. de
      Mussidan is aware that his sweet, pure daughter has had a lover, he will
      be only too happy to accept the Marquis de Croisenois as his son-in-law."
      Tantaine believed that Sabine was more culpable than she really had been,
      for the idea of pure and honorable love had never entered his brain.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XXVIII.
    
    
      THE TEMPTER.
    
    
      By this time Tantaine was in the Champs Elysees, and stared anxiously
      around. "If my Toto makes no mistake," muttered he, "surely my order was
      plain enough."
    
    
      The old man got very cross as he at last perceived the missing lad
      conversing with the proprietor of a pie-stall, having evidently been doing
      a little jawing with him.
    
    
      "Toto," he called, "Toto, come here."
    
    
      Toto Chupin heard him, for he looked round, but he did not move, for he
      was certainly much interested in the conversation he was carrying on.
      Tantaine shouted again, and this time more angrily than before, and Toto,
      reluctantly leaving his companion, came slowly up to his patron.
    
    
      "You have been a nice time getting here," said the lad sulkily. "I was
      just going to cut it. Ain't you well that you make such a row? If you
      ain't, I'd better go for a doctor.
    
    
      "I am in a tremendous hurry, Toto."
    
    
      "Yes, and so is the postman when he is behind time. I'm busy too."
    
    
      "What, with the man you have just left?"
    
    
      "Yes; he is a sharper chap than I am. How much do you earn every day,
      Daddy Tantaine? Well, that chap makes his thirty or forty francs every
      night, and does precious little for it. I should like a business like
      that, and I think that I shall secure one soon."
    
    
      "Have patience. I thought that you were going into business with those two
      young men you were drinking beer with at the Grand Turk?"
    
    
      Toto uttered a shrill cry of anger at these words. "Business with them?"
      shrieked he; "they are regular clever night thieves."
    
    
      "Have they done you any harm, my poor lad?"
    
    
      "Yes; they have utterly ruined me. Luckily, I saw Mascarin yesterday, and
      he set me up in the hot-chestnut line. He ain't a bad one, is Mascarin."
    
    
      Tantaine curled his lip disdainfully. "Not a bad fellow, I dare say, as
      long as you don't ask him for anything."
    
    
      Toto was so surprised at hearing Tantaine abuse Mascarin, that he was
      unable to utter a word.
    
    
      "Ah, you may look surprised," continued the old man, "but when a man is
      rolling in riches, and leaves an old friend to starve, then he is not what
      I call a real good fellow. Now, Toto, you are a bright lad, and so I don't
      mind letting you know that I am only waiting for a good chance to drop
      Mascarin, and set up on my own account. Work for yourself, my boy."
    
    
      "I know that; but it is a good deal easier to say than to do."
    
    
      "You have tried then?"
    
    
      "Yes, I have; but I came to grief over it. You know all about it as well
      as I do, for don't tell me you didn't hear every word I said that night
      you were hunting up Caroline Schimmel. However, I'll tell you. One day
      when I saw a lady who looked rather nervous get out of a cab, I followed
      her. I was decently togged out, so I rang at the door. I was so sure that
      I was going to make a haul that I would not have taken ninety-nine francs
      for the hundred that I expected to make. Well, I rang, a girl opened the
      door, and in I went. What an ass I made of myself! I found a great brute
      of a man there, who thrashed me within an inch of my life, and then kicked
      me downstairs. See, he made his mark rather more plainly than I liked."
      And removing his cap, the boy showed several bruises about his forehead.
    
    
      During this conversation Tantaine and the lad had been walking slowly up
      the Champs Elysees, and had by this time arrived just opposite M.
      Gandelu's house, where Andre was at work. Tantaine sat down on a bench.
    
    
      "Let us rest a bit," said he; "I am tired out; and now let me tell you, my
      lad, that your tale only shows me that it is experience you want. Now, I
      have any amount of that, and I was really the prime mover in most of
      Mascarin's schemes. If I were to start on my own account, I should be
      driving in my carriage in twelve months. The only thing against my success
      is my age, for I am getting to be an old man. Why, even now I have a
      matter in my hands that is simply splendid. I have had half the money
      down, but I want a smart young fellow to pull it through."
    
    
      "Why couldn't I be the smart young fellow?" asked Toto.
    
    
      Tantaine shook his head. "You are as much too young as I am too old,"
      answered he. "At your age you are too apt to be frightened, and would
      shrink back at the critical time. Besides, I have a conscience."
    
    
      "And so have I," exclaimed Toto; "and it's grown like your own, old man;
      it can be stretched for miles and folded up into nothing."
    
    
      "Well, we may be able to do something," returned Tantaine, as, drawing out
      a ragged check pocket-handkerchief, he wiped his glasses.
    
    
      "Listen to me, my lad; I'll put what we call a supposititious case to you.
      You hate those two fellows who have robbed you, for I suppose that is what
      you meant; well, suppose you knew that they were at work all day on a high
      scaffold like that one opposite to us, what would you do?"
    
    
      Toto scratched his head, and remarked after a pause,       
    
    
      "If that crack-jawed idea you talk of was true," answered he, "those gay
      lads might as well make their wills, for I'd step up the scaffolding at
      night and just saw the planks that they are in the habit of clapping their
      toes on, half through, and when one of the mates stepped on it, why, there
      would be a bit of a smash, eh, Daddy Tantaine?"
    
    
      "Not so bad, not so bad for a lad of your years," said the old man with an
      approving smile.
    
    
      Toto's bosom swelled with pride.
    
    
      "Besides," he continued, "I would arrange matters so well that not a soul
      would think that I had done the trick."
    
    
      "The more I hear you speak, Chupin," answered Tantaine, "the more I
      believe you are the lad I want, and I am sure that we shall make heaps of
      money together."
    
    
      "I am cock sure of that too."
    
    
      "You can use carpenters' tools, I think you once told me?"
    
    
      "Yes."
    
    
      "Well," continued Tantaine, "let me tell you then that I know an old man
      with any amount of money, and there is a fellow whom he hates and detests,
      a young chap who ran off with the girl he loved."
    
    
      "The old bloke must have been jolly wild."
    
    
      "Well, to tell the truth, he wasn't a bit pleased. Now it so happens that
      this gay young dog spends ten hours a day at least on that very
      scaffolding opposite to us. The old fellow, who has his head screwed on
      the right way, had the very same idea as yours, but he is too old and too
      stout to do the trick for himself; and, to cut the matter short, he would
      give five thousand francs to the persons who would carry out his idea.
      Just think, two thousand francs for a few cuts of a saw!"
    
    
      The boy was violently agitated, but Tantaine pretended not to notice it.
    
    
      "First, my lad," said he, "I must explain to you in what measure the old
      gentleman's plans are different from yours. If we did not take care, some
      other poor devil might break his neck, but I have hit on a dodge to avoid
      all this."
    
    
      "I ain't curious, but I should like to hear it."
    
    
      Tantaine smiled blandly.
    
    
      "Listen! Do you see high up; that little shed built of planks? That is
      used by the carvers and stone-cutters. Well, this little house, a couple
      of hundred feet above us, has a kind of a window; well, if this window and
      the planks below it were cut nearly through, any one leaning against it
      would be very likely to fall into the street and perhaps to hurt himself."
    
    
      Chupin nodded.
    
    
      "Now, suppose," went on Tantaine, "that the enemy of our old gentleman was
      in that little shed, all at once he hears a woman shriek, 'Help! It is I
      you love; help me!' what would this young fellow do? Why, he would
      recognize the voice, rush to the window, lean out, and as the woodwork and
      supports had been cut away, he would              Well, do you see now?"
    
    
      Chupin hesitated for a moment.
    
    
      "I don't say I won't," muttered he; "but, look here, will the old chap pay
      down smart?"
    
    
      "Yes, and besides, did I not tell you that he had given half down?"
    
    
      The boy's eyes glistened as the old man unpinned the tattered lining of
      his pocket, and holding the pin between his teeth, pulled out the
      banknotes, each one for a thousand francs. Chupin's heart rose at the
      sight of this wealth.
    
    
      "Is one of those for me?" asked he. Tantaine held the note towards the
      boy, who shuddered at the touch of the crisp paper and kissed the precious
      object in a paroxysm of pleasure. He then started from his seat, and
      regardless of the astonishment of the passers-by, executed a wild dance of
      triumph.
    
    
      All was soon settled. Toto was to creep into the unfinished building by
      night, and not to leave it until he had completed his work. Tantaine, who
      had a thought for everything, told the boy what sort of a saw to employ,
      and gave him the address of a man who supplied the best class instruments.
    
    
      "You must remember, my dear lad," said he, "not to leave behind you any
      traces of your work which may cause suspicion. One grain of sawdust on the
      floor might spoil the whole game. Take a dark lantern with you, grease
      your saw, and rasp out the tooth-nicks of the saw when you have finished
      your work."
    
    
      Toto listened to the old man in surprise; he had never thought that he was
      of so practical a turn. He promised that he would be careful, and
      imagining that he had received all his directions, rose to leave; but the
      old man still detained him.
    
    
      "Here," said he, "suppose you tell me a little about Caroline Schimmel.
      You told Beaumarchef that she said I had made her scream, and that when
      she caught me, I should have a bad time of it, eh?"
    
    
      "You weren't my partner then," returned the lad with an impudent laugh;
      "and I wanted to give you a bit of a fright. The truth is, that you made
      the poor old girl so drunk that she has had to go to the hospital."
    
    
      Tantaine was overjoyed at this news, and, rising from his seat, said,
      "Where are you living now?"
    
    
      "Nowhere in particular. Yesterday I slept in a stable, but there isn't
      room for all my furniture there, so I must shift."
    
    
      "Would you like to have my room for a day or two?" asked Tantaine,
      chuckling at the boy's jest. "I have moved from there, but the attic is
      mine for another fortnight yet."
    
    
      "I'm gone; where is it?"
    
    
      "You know well enough, in the Hotel de Perou, Rue de la Hachette. Then I
      will send a line to the landlady;" and tearing a leaf from his pocketbook,
      he scrawled on it a few words, saying that young relative of his, M.
      Chupin, was to have his room.
    
    
      This letter, together with his banknote, Toto carefully tied up in the
      corner of his neckerchief, and as he crossed the street the old man
      watched him for a moment, and then stood gazing at the workmen on the
      scaffolding. Just then Gandelu and his son came out, and the contractor
      paused to give a few instructions. For a few seconds Gaston and Chupin
      stood side by side, and a strange smile flitted across Tantaine's face as
      he noted this. "Both children of Paris," muttered he, "and both striking
      examples of the boasted civilization. The dandy struts along the pavement,
      while the street arab plays in the gutter."
    
    
      But he had no time to spend in philosophical speculations, as the omnibus
      that he required appeared, and entering it, in another half-hour he
      entered Paul Violaine's lodgings in the Rue Montmartre.
    
    
      The portress, Mother Brigaut, was at her post as Tantaine entered the
      courtyard and asked,       
    
    
      "And how is our young gentleman to-day?"
    
    
      "Better, sir, ever so much better; I made him a lovely bowl of soup
      yesterday, and he drank up every drop of it. He looks like a real king
      this morning, and the doctor sent in a dozen of wine to-day, which will, I
      am sure, effect a perfect cure."
    
    
      With a smile and a nod Tantaine was making his way to the stairs, when
      Mother Brigaut prevented his progress.
    
    
      "Some one was here yesterday," remarked she, "asking about M. Paul."
    
    
      "What sort of a looking person was it?"
    
    
      "Oh, a man like any other, nothing in particular about him, but he wasn't
      a gentleman, for after keeping me for fully fifteen minutes talking and
      talking, he only gave me a five-franc piece."
    
    
      The description was not one that would lead to a recognition of the
      person, and Tantaine asked in tones of extreme annoyance,       
    
    
      "Did you not notice anything particular about the man?"
    
    
      "Yes, he had on gold spectacles with the mountings as fine as a hair, and
      a watch chain as thick and heavy as I have ever seen."
    
    
      "And is that all?"
    
    
      "Yes," answered she. "Oh! there was one thing more       the person knows
      that you come here."
    
    
      "Does he? Why do you think so?"
    
    
      "Because all the time he was talking to me he was in a rare fidget, and
      always kept his eyes on the door."
    
    
      "Thanks, Mother Brigaut; mind and keep a sharp lookout," returned
      Tantaine, as he slowly ascended the stairs.
    
    
      Every now and then he paused to think. "Who upon earth can this fellow
      be?" asked he of himself. He reviewed the whole question       chances,
      probabilities, and risks, not one was neglected, but all in vain.
    
    
      "A thousand devils!" growled he; "are the police at my heels?"
    
    
      His nerves were terribly shaken, and he strove in vain to regain his
      customary audacity. By this time he had reached the door of Paul's room,
      and, on his ringing, the door was at once opened; but at the sight of this
      woman he started back, with a cry of angry surprise; for it was a female
      figure that stood before him, a young girl       Flavia, the daughter of
      Martin Rigal, the banker.
    
    
      The keen eyes of Tantaine showed him that Flavia's visit had not been of
      long duration. She had removed her hat and jacket, and was holding in her
      hand a piece of fancy work.
    
    
      "Whom do you wish to see, sir?" asked she.
    
    
      The old man strove to speak, but his lips would not frame a single
      sentence. A band of steel seemed to be compressing his throat, and he
      appeared like a man about to be seized with an apoplectic fit.
    
    
      Flavia gazed upon the shabby-looking visitor with an expression of intense
      disgust. It seemed to her that she had seen him somewhere; in fact, there
      was an inexplicable manner about him which entirely puzzled her.
    
    
      "I want to speak to M. Paul," said the old man in a low, hoarse whisper;
      "he is expecting me."
    
    
      "Then come in; but just now his doctor is with him."
    
    
      She threw open the door more widely, and stepped back, so that the greasy
      garments of the visitor might not touch her dress. He passed her with an
      abject bow, and crossed the little sitting-room with the air of a man who
      perfectly understands his way. He did not knock at the door of the
      bedroom, but went straight in; there a singular spectacle at once arrested
      his attention. Paul, with a very pale face, was seated on the bed, while
      Hortebise was attentively examining his bare shoulder. The whole of Paul's
      right arm and shoulder was a large open wound, which seemed to have been
      caused by a burn or scald, and must have been extremely painful. The
      doctor was bending over him, applying a cooling lotion to the injured
      place with a small piece of sponge. He turned sharply round on Daddy
      Tantaine's entrance; and so accustomed were these men to read each other's
      faces at a glance that Hortebise saw at once what had happened; for
      Tantaine's expression plainly said, "Is Flavia mad to be here?" while the
      eyes of Hortebise answered, "She may be, but I could not help it."
    
    
      Paul turned, too, and greeted the old man with an exclamation of delight.
    
    
      "Come here," said he merrily, "and just see to what a wretched state I
      have been reduced between the doctor and M. Mascarin."
    
    
      Tantaine examined the wound carefully. "Are you quite sure," asked he,
      "that not only will it deceive the Duke, who will see but with our eyes,
      but also those of his wife, and perhaps of his medical man?"
    
    
      "We will hoodwink the lot of them."
    
    
      "And how long must we wait," asked the old man, "until the place skins
      over, and assumes the appearance of having been there from childhood?"
    
    
      "In a month's time Paul can be introduced to the Duke de Champdoce."
    
    
      "Are you speaking seriously?"
    
    
      "Listen to me. The scar will not be quite natural then, but I intend to
      subject it to various other modes of treatment."
    
    
      The dressing was now over, and Paul's shirt being readjusted, he was
      permitted to lie down again.
    
    
      "I am quite willing to remain here forever," said he, "as long as I am
      allowed to retain the services of the nurse that I have in the next room,
      and who, I am sure, is waiting with the greatest eagerness for your
      departure."
    
    
      Hortebise fumed, and cast a glance at Paul which seemed to say, "Be
      silent;" but the conceited young man paid no heed to it.
    
    
      "How long has this charming nurse been with you?" asked Tantaine in an
      unnatural voice.
    
    
      "Ever since I have been in bed," returned Paul with the air of a gay young
      fellow. "I wrote a note that I was unable to go over to her, so she came
      to me. I sent my letter at nine o'clock, and at ten minutes past she was
      with me."
    
    
      The diplomatic doctor slipped behind Tantaine, and made violent gestures
      to endeavor to persuade Paul to keep silence, but all was in vain.
    
    
      "M. Martin Rigal," continued the vain young fool, "passes the greater part
      of his life in his private office. As soon as he gets up he goes there,
      and is not seen for the rest of the day. Flavia can therefore do entirely
      as she likes. As soon as she knows that her worthy father is deep in his
      ledgers, she puts on her hat and runs round to me, and no one could have a
      kinder and a prettier visitor than she is."
    
    
      The doctor was hard at work at his danger signals, but it was useless.
      Paul saw them, but did not comprehend their meaning; and Tantaine rubbed
      his glasses savagely.
    
    
      "You are perhaps deceiving yourself a little," said he at last.
    
    
      "And why? You know that Flavia loves me, poor girl. I ought to marry her,
      and of course I shall; but still, if I do not do so       well, you know,
      I need say no more."
    
    
      "You wretched scoundrel!" exclaimed the usually placid Tantaine. His
      manner was so fierce and threatening that Paul shifted his position to one
      nearer the wall.
    
    
      It was impossible for Tantaine to say another word, for Hortebise placed
      his hand upon his lips, and dragged him from the room.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XXIX.
    
    
      THE TAFILA COPPER MINES, LIMITED.
    
    
      Paul could not for the life of him imagine why Tantaine had left the room
      in apparently so angry a mood. He had certainly spoken of Flavia in a most
      improper manner; for the very weakness of which she had been guilty should
      have caused him to treat her with tender deference and respect. He could
      understand the anger of Hortebise, who was Rigal's friend; but what on
      earth had Tantaine in common with the wealthy banker and his daughter?
      Forgetful of the pain which the smallest movement upon his part produced,
      Paul sat up in his bed, and listened with intense eagerness, hoping to
      catch what was going on in the next room; but he could hear nothing
      through the thick walls and the closed door.
    
    
      "What can they be doing?" asked he. "What fresh plot are they contriving?"
    
    
      Daddy Tantaine and Hortebise passed out of the room hastily, but when they
      reached the staircase they stood still. The doctor wore the same smiling
      expression of face, and he endeavored to calm his companion, who appeared
      to be on the verge of desperation.
    
    
      "Have courage," whispered he; "what is the use of giving way to passion?
      You cannot help this; it is too late now. Besides, even if you could, you
      would not, as you know very well, indeed!"
    
    
      The old man was moving his spectacles, not to wipe his glasses, but his
      eyes.
    
    
      "Ah!" moaned he, "now I can enter into the feelings of M. de Mussidan when
      I proved to him that his daughter had a lover. I have been hard and
      pitiless, and I am cruelly punished."
    
    
      "My old friend, you must not attach too much importance to what you have
      heard. Paul is a mere boy, and, of course, a boaster."
    
    
      "Paul is a miserably cowardly dog," answered the old man in a fierce
      undertone. "Paul does not love the girl as she loves him; but what he says
      is true, only too true, I can feel. Between her father and her lover she
      would not hesitate for a moment. Ah! unhappy girl, what a terrible future
      lies before her."
    
    
      He stopped himself abruptly.
    
    
      "I cannot speak to her myself," resumed he; "do you, doctor, strive and
      make her have reason."
    
    
      Hortebise shrugged his shoulders. "I will see what my powers of oratory
      can do," answered he; "but you are not quite yourself to-day. Remember
      that a chance word will betray the secret of our lives."
    
    
      "Go at once, and I swear to you that, happen what may, I will be calm."
    
    
      The doctor went back into Paul's room, while Tantaine sat down on the
      topmost stair, his face buried in his hands.
    
    
      Mademoiselle Flavia was just going to Paul, when the doctor again
      appeared.
    
    
      "What, back again?" asked she petulantly. "I thought that you had been far
      away by this time."
    
    
      "I want to say something to you," answered he, "and something of a rather
      serious nature. You must not elevate those charming eyebrows. I see you
      guess what I am going to say, and you are right. I am come to tell you
      that this is not the proper place for Mademoiselle Rigal."
    
    
      "I know that."
    
    
      This unexpected reply, made with the calmest air in the world, utterly
      disconcerted the smiling doctor.
    
    
      "It seems to me              " began he.
    
    
      "That I ought not to be here; but then, you see, I place duty before cold,
      worldly dictates. Paul is very ill, and has no one to take care of him
      except his affianced bride; for has not my father given his consent to our
      union?"
    
    
      "Flavia, listen to the experience of a man of the world. The nature of men
      is such that they never forgive a woman for compromising her reputation,
      even though it be in their own favor. Do you know what people will say
      twenty-four hours after your marriage? Why, that you had been his mistress
      for weeks before, and that it was only the knowledge of that fact that
      inclined your father to consent to the alliance."
    
    
      Flavia's face grew crimson. "Very well," said she, "I will obey, and never
      say again that I was obstinate; but let me say one word to Paul, and then
      I will leave him."
    
    
      The doctor retired, not guessing that this obedience arose from the sudden
      suspicion which had arisen in Flavia's mind. "It is done," said he, as he
      rejoined Tantaine on the stairs; "let us hasten, for she will follow us at
      once."
    
    
      By the time that Tantaine got into the street, he seemed to have recovered
      a certain amount of his self-command. "We have succeeded," said he, "but
      we shall have to work hard, and this marriage must be hastened by every
      means in our power. It can be celebrated now without any risk, for in
      twelve hours the only obstacle that stands between that youth there and
      the colossal fortune of the Champdoce will have vanished away."
    
    
      Though he had expected something of the kind, the face of the doctor grew
      very pale.
    
    
      "What, Andre?" faltered he.
    
    
      "Andre is in great danger, doctor, and may not survive to-morrow, and a
      portion of the work necessary to this end will be done to-night by our
      young friend Toto Chupin."
    
    
      "By that young scamp? Why, only the other day you laughed when I suggested
      employing him."
    
    
      "I shall this time kill two birds with one stone. Once an investigation is
      made       let us speak plainly       into Andre's death, there will be
      some inquiry made as to a certain window frame that has been sawed
      through, and suspicion will fall upon Toto Chupin, who will have been seen
      lurking about the spot. It will be proved that he purchased a saw, and
      that he changed just before a note for one thousand francs; he will be
      found hiding in a garret in the Hotel de Perou."
    
    
      The doctor looked aghast. "Are you mad?" cried he. "Toto will accuse you."
    
    
      "Very likely, but by that time poor old Tantaine will be dead and buried.
      Then Mascarin will disappear, our faithful Beaumarchef will be in the
      United States, and we can afford to laugh at the police."
    
    
      "It seems like a success," said the doctor, "but push on for mercy's sake;
      all these delays and fluctuations will make me seriously ill."
    
    
      The two worthy associates held this conversation in a doorway, anxious to
      be sure that Flavia had kept her promise. In a brief space of time they
      saw her come out of the house and move in the direction of her father's
      bank.
    
    
      "Now," said Tantaine, "I can go in peace, doctor; farewell for the
      present;" and without waiting for a reply he was walking rapidly away when
      he was stopped by Beaumarchef, who came up breathless and barred his
      passage.
    
    
      "I was looking for you," cried he; "the Marquis de Croisenois is in the
      office and is swearing at me like anything."
    
    
      "Go back to the office and tell the Marquis that the master will soon be
      with him;" and thus speaking, Tantaine disappeared down a court by the
      side of Martin Rigal's house.
    
    
      The Marquis was striding up and down the office, every now and then
      discharging a rumbling cannonade of oaths. "Fine business people,"
      remarked he, "to make an appointment and then not to keep it!" He checked
      himself; for the door of the inner office slowly opened, and Mascarin
      appeared on the threshold. "Punctuality," said he, "does not consist in
      coming before, but at the time appointed."
    
    
      The Marquis was cowed at once, and followed Mascarin into the sanctum and
      watched him with curious gaze as the redoubtable head of the association
      seemed to be searching for something among the papers on his desk. When
      Mascarin had found what he was in search of, he turned and addressed the
      Marquis.
    
    
      "I desired to see you," said he, "with reference to the great financial
      enterprise which you are to launch almost immediately."
    
    
      "Yes; I understand that we must discuss it, fully understand it, and feel
      our way."
    
    
      Mascarin uttered a contemptuous whistle.
    
    
      "Do you think," asked he, "that I am the kind of person to stand and wait
      while you feel your way? Because if you do, the sooner you undeceive
      yourself the better. Things that I take in hand are carried out like a
      flash of lightning. You have been playing while I and Catenac have been
      working, and nothing remains to be done but to act."
    
    
      "Act! What do you mean?"
    
    
      "I mean that offices have been taken in the Rue Vivienne, that the
      articles of association have been drawn up, the directors chosen, and the
      Company registered. The printer brought the prospectus here yesterday; you
      can begin sending them out to-morrow."
    
    
      "But              "
    
    
      "Read it for yourself," said Mascarin, handing a printed paper to him.
      "Read, and then, perhaps, you will be convinced."
    
    
      Croisenois, in a dazed sort of manner, accepted the paper and read it
      aloud.
    
    
      COPPER MINES OF TAFILA, ALGERIA.
    
    
      Chairman: THE MARQUIS HENRI DE CROISENOIS.
    
    
      Capital: Four Million Francs.
    
    
      This company does not appeal to that rash class of speculators who are
      willing to incur great risks for the sake of obtaining for a time heavy
      dividends.
    
    
      The shareholders in the Tafila Copper Mining Company, Limited, must not
      look for a dividend of more than six, or at the utmost seven, per cent.
    
    
      "Well," interrupted Mascarin, "what do you think of this for a beginning?"
    
    
      "It seems fair enough," answered De Croisenois, "but suppose others than
      those whose names you have in your black list take shares, what do you say
      we are to do then?"
    
    
      "We should simply decline to allot shares to them, that is all. See the
      Article XX. in the Articles of Association. 'The Board of Directors may
      decline to allot shares to applicants without giving any reason for so
      doing.'"
    
    
      "And suppose," continued the Marquis, "that one of our own people dispose
      of his share, may we not find our new shareholder a thorn in our side?"
    
    
      "Article XXI. 'No transfer of stock is valid, unless passed by the Board
      of Directors, and recorded in the books of the Company,'" read out
      Mascarin.
    
    
      "And how will the game be brought to a conclusion?"
    
    
      "Easily enough. You will advertise one morning that two-thirds of the
      capital having been unsuccessfully sunk in the enterprise, you are
      compelled to apply for a winding-up of the Company under Article XVII. Six
      months afterwards you will announce that the liquidation of the Company
      has, after all expenses have been paid, left no balance whatsoever. Then
      you wash your hands of the whole thing, and the matter is at an end."
    
    
      Croisenois felt that he had no ground to stand upon, but he ventured on
      one more objection.
    
    
      "It seems rather a strange thing to launch this enterprise at the present
      moment. May it not interfere with my marriage prospects? and may not the
      Count de Mussidan decline to give me his daughter and risk her dowry in
      this manner? One moment, I       "
    
    
      The agent sneered and cut short the tergiversations of the Marquis.
    
    
      "You mean, I suppose," said he, "that when once you are safely married and
      have received Mademoiselle Sabine's dowry, you will take leave of us. Not
      so, my dear young friend; and if this is your idea, put it aside, for it
      is utter nonsense. I should hold you then as I do now."
    
    
      The Marquis saw that any further struggle would be of no avail, and gave
      in.
    
    
    
      That evening, when M. Martin Rigal emerged from his private office, his
      daughter Flavia was more than usually demonstrative in her tokens of
      affection. "How fondly I love you, my dearest father!" said she, as she
      rained kisses on his cheeks. "How good you are to me!" but on this
      occasion the banker was too much preoccupied to ask his daughter the
      reason for this extreme tenderness on her part.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XXX.
    
    
      THE VEILED PORTRAIT.
    
    
      The danger with which Andre was menaced was most terrible, and the
      importance of the game he was playing made him feel that he had everything
      to fear from the boldness and audacity of his enemies. He knew this, and
      he also knew that spies dogged all his movements. What could be wanted but
      a favorable opportunity to assassinate him. But even this knowledge did
      not make him hesitate for an instant, and all his caution was fully
      exercised, for he felt that should he perish, Sabine would be inevitably
      lost. On her account he acted with a prudence which was certainly not one
      of his general characteristics. He was quite aware that he might put
      himself under the protection of the police, but this he knew would be to
      imperil the honor of the Mussidan family. He was sure that with time and
      patience he should be able to unravel the plots of the villains who were
      at work. But he had not time to do so by degrees. No, he must make a bold
      dash at once. The hideous sacrifice of which Sabine was to be the victim
      was being hurried on, and it seemed to him as if his very existence was
      being carried away by the hours as they flitted by. He went over recent
      events carefully one by one, and he strove to piece them together as a
      child does the portions of a dissected map. He wanted to find out the one
      common interest that bound all these plotters together       Verminet, Van
      Klopen, Mascarin, Hortebise, and Martin Rigal. As he submitted all this
      strange combination of persons to the test, the thought of Gaston de
      Gandelu came across his mind.
    
    
      "Is it not curious," thought he, "that this unhappy boy should be the
      victim of the cruel band of miscreants who are trying to destroy us? It is
      strange, very strange."
    
    
      Suddenly he started to his feet, for a fresh idea had flashed across his
      brain       a thought that was as yet but crude and undefined, but which
      seemed to bear the promise of hope and deliverance. It seemed to him that
      the affair of young Gandelu was closely connected with his own, that they
      were part and parcel of the same dark plot, and that these bills with
      their forged acceptance had more to do with him than he had ever imagined.
      How it was that he and Gaston could be connected he could not for a moment
      guess; yet now he would have cheerfully sworn that such was the case. Who
      was it that had informed the father of the son's conduct? Why, Catenac.
      Who had advised that proceedings should be taken against Rose, alias
      Zora? Why, Catenac again; and this same man, in addition to acting for
      Gandelu, it seems, was also the confidential solicitor of the Marquis de
      Croisenois and Verminet. Perhaps he had only obeyed their instructions.
      All this was very vague and unsatisfactory, but it might be something to
      go upon, and who could say what conclusion careful inquiry might not lead
      him to? and Andre determined to carry on his investigations, and endeavor
      to find the hidden links that connected this chain of rascality together.
      He had taken up a pencil with the view of making a few notes, when he
      heard a knock at his door. He glanced at the clock; it was not yet nine.
    
    
      "Come in," cried he as he rose.
    
    
      The door was thrown open, and the young artist started as he recognized in
      his early visitor the father of Sabine. It was after a sleepless night
      that the Count had decided to take the present step. He was terribly
      agitated, but had had time to prepare himself for this all-important
      interview.
    
    
      "You will, I trust, pardon me, sir," said he, "for making such an early
      call upon you, but I thought that I should be sure to find you at this
      hour, and much wanted to see you."
    
    
      Andre bowed.
    
    
      In the space of one brief instant a thousand suppositions, each one more
      unlikely than the other, coursed through his brain. Why had the Count
      called? Who could have given him his address? And was the visit friendly
      or hostile?
    
    
      "I am a great admirer of paintings," began the Count, "and one of my
      friends upon whose taste I can rely has spoken to me in the warmest terms
      of your talent. This I trust will explain the liberty I have taken.
      Curiosity drove me to              "
    
    
      He paused for a moment, and then added,       
    
    
      "My name is the Marquis de Bevron."
    
    
      The concealment of the Count's real name showed Andre that the visit was
      not entirely a friendly one, and Andre replied,       
    
    
      "I am only too pleased to receive your visit. Unfortunately just now I
      have nothing ready, only a few rough sketches in short. Would you like to
      see them?"
    
    
      The Count replied eagerly in the affirmative. He was terribly embarrassed
      under his fictitious name, and shrank before the honest, open gaze of the
      young artist, and his mental disturbance was completed by seeing in one
      corner of the room the picture covered with a green cloth, which Tantaine
      had alluded to. It was evident that the old villain had told the truth,
      and that his daughter's portrait was concealed behind this wrapper. She
      had evidently been here       had spent hours here, and whose fault was
      it? She had but listened to the voice of her heart, and had sought that
      affection abroad which she was unable to obtain at home. As the Count
      gazed upon the young man before him, he was forced to admit that
      Mademoiselle Sabine had not fixed her affections on an unworthy object,
      for at the very first glance he had been struck with the manly beauty of
      the young artist, and the clear intelligence of his face.
    
    
      "Ah," thought Andre, "you come to me under a name that is not your own,
      and I will respect your wish to remain unknown, but I will take advantage
      of it by letting you know things which I should not dare say to your
      face."
    
    
      Great as was Andre's preoccupation, he could not fail to notice that his
      visitor's eyes sought the veiled picture with strange persistency. While
      M. de Mussidan was looking at the various sketches on the walls, Andre had
      time to recover all his self-command.
    
    
      "Let me congratulate you, sir," remarked the Count, as he returned to the
      spot where the painter was standing. "My friend's admiration was well
      founded. I am sorry, however, that you have nothing finished to show me.
      You say that you have nothing, I believe?"
    
    
      "Nothing, Marquis."
    
    
      "Not even that picture whose frame I can distinguish through the serge
      curtain that covers it?"
    
    
      Andre blushed, though he had been expecting the question from the
      commencement.
    
    
      "Excuse me," answered he; "that picture is certainly finished, but it is
      not on view."
    
    
      The Count was now sure that Tantaine's statement was correct.
    
    
      "I suppose that it is some woman's portrait," remarked the false Marquis.
    
    
      "You are quite correct."
    
    
      Both men were much agitated at this moment, and avoided meeting each
      other's eyes.
    
    
      The Count, however, had made up his mind that he would go on to the end.
    
    
      "Ah, you are in love, I see!" remarked he with a forced laugh. "All great
      artists have depicted the charms of their mistresses on canvas."
    
    
      "Stop," cried Andre with an angry glance in his eyes. "The picture you
      refer to is the portrait of the purest and most innocent girl in the
      world. I shall love her all my life; but, if possible, my respect for her
      is greater than my love. I should consider myself a most degraded wretch,
      had I ever whispered in her ear a word that her mother might not have
      listened to."
    
    
      A feeling of the most instantaneous relief thrilled through M. de
      Mussidan's heart.
    
    
      "You will pardon me," suggested he blandly, "but when one sees a portrait
      in a studio, the inference is that a sitting or two has taken place?"
    
    
      "You are right. She came here secretly, and without the knowledge of her
      family, at the risk of her honor and reputation, thus affording me the
      strongest proof of her love. It was cruel of me," continued the young
      artist, "to accept this proof of her entire devotion, and yet not only did
      I accept it, but I pleaded for it on my bended knee, for how else was I to
      hear the music of her voice, or gladden my eyes with her beauty? We love
      each other, but a gulf wider than the stormy sea divides us. She is an
      heiress, come of a proud and haughty line of nobles, while I              "
    
    
      Andre paused, waiting for some words wither of encouragement or censure;
      but the Count remained silent, and the young man continued,       
    
    
      "Do you know who I am? A poor foundling, placed in the Hospital of
      Vendome, the illicit offspring of some poor betrayed girl. I started in
      the world with twenty francs in my pocket, and found my way to Paris;
      since then I have earned my bread by my daily work. You only see here the
      more brilliant side of my life; for an artist here       I am a common
      work-man elsewhere."
    
    
      If M. de Mussidan remained silent, it was from extreme admiration of the
      noble character, which was so unexpectedly revealed to him, and he was
      endeavoring to conceal it.
    
    
      "She knows all this," pursued Andre, "and yet she loves me. It was here,
      in this very room, that she vowed that she could never be the wife of
      another. Not a month ago, a gentleman, well born, wealthy, and
      fascinating, with every characteristic that a woman could love, was a
      suitor for her hand. She went boldly to him, told him the story of our
      love, and, like a noble-hearted gentleman, he withdrew at once, and to-day
      is my best and kindest friend. Now, Marquis, would you like to see this
      young girl's picture?"
    
    
      "Yes," answered the Count, "and I shall feel deeply grateful to you for
      such a mark of confidence."
    
    
      Andre went to the picture, but as he touched the curtain he turned quickly
      towards his visitor.
    
    
      "No," said he, "I can no longer continue this farce; it is unworthy of
      me."
    
    
      M. de Mussidan turned pale.
    
    
      "I am about to see Sabine de Mussidan's portrait. Draw the curtain."
    
    
      Andre obeyed, and for a moment the Count stood entranced before the work
      of genius that met his eyes.
    
    
      "It is she!" said the father. "Her very smile; the same soft light in her
      eyes. It is exquisite!"
    
    
      Misfortune is a harsh teacher; some weeks ago he would have smiled
      superciliously at the mere idea of granting his daughter's hand to a
      struggling artist, for then he thought only of M. de Breulh, but now he
      would have esteemed it a precious boon had he been allowed to choose Andre
      as Sabine's husband. But Henri de Croisenois stood in the way, and as this
      idea flashed across the Count's mind he gave a perceptible start. He was
      sure from the excessive calmness of the young man that he must be well
      acquainted with all recent events. He asked the question, and Andre, in
      the most open manner, told him all he knew. The generosity of M. de
      Breulh, the kindness of Madame Bois Arden, his suspicions, his inquiries,
      his projects, and his hopes. M. de Mussidan gazed once more upon his
      daughter's portrait, and then taking the hand of the young painter, said,       
    
    
      "M. Andre, if ever we can free ourselves from those miscreants, whose
      daggers are pointed at our hearts, Sabine shall be your wife."
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XXXI.
    
    
      GASTON'S DILEMMA.
    
    
      Yes, Sabine might yet be his, but between the lovers stood the forms of
      Croisenois and his associates. But now he felt strong enough to contend
      with them all.
    
    
      "To work!" said he, "to work!"
    
    
      Just then, however, he heard a sound of ringing laughter outside his door.
      He could distinguish a woman's voice, and also a man's, speaking in high,
      shrill tones. All at once his door burst open, and a hurricane of silks,
      velvets, feathers, and lace whirled in. With extreme surprise, the young
      artist recognized the beautiful features of Rose, alias Zora de
      Chantemille. Gaston de Gandelu followed her, and at once began,       
    
    
      "Here we are," said he, "all right again. Did you expect to see us?"
    
    
      "Not in the least."
    
    
      "Ah! well, it is a little surprise of the governor's. On my word, I really
      will be a dutiful son for the future. To-day, the good old boy came into
      my room, and said, 'This morning I took the necessary steps to release the
      person in whom you are interested. Go and meet her.' What do you think of
      that? So off I ran to find Zora, and here we are."
    
    
      Andre did not pay much attention to Gaston, but was engaged in watching
      Zora, who was looking round the studio. She went up to Sabine's portrait,
      and was about to draw the curtain, when Andre exclaimed,       
    
    
      "Excuse me," said he; "I must put this picture to dry." And as the
      portrait stood on a moveable easel, he wheeled it into the adjoining room.
    
    
      "And now," said Gaston, "I want you to come and breakfast with us to
      celebrate Zora's happy release."
    
    
      "I am much obliged to you, but it is impossible. I must get on with my
      work."
    
    
      "Yes, yes; work is an excellent thing, but just now you must go and
      dress."
    
    
      "I assure you that it is quite out of the question. I cannot leave the
      studio yet."
    
    
      Gaston paused for a moment in deep thought.
    
    
      "I have it," said he triumphantly. "You will not come to breakfast; then
      breakfast shall come to you. I am off to order it."
    
    
      Andre ran after him, but Gaston was too quick, and he returned to the
      studio in anything but an amiable temper. Zora noticed his evident
      annoyance.
    
    
      "He always goes on in this absurd way," said she, with a shrug of her
      pretty shoulders, "and thinks himself so clever and witty, bah!"
    
    
      Her tone disclosed such contempt for Gaston that Andre looked at her in
      perplexed surprise.
    
    
      "What do you look so astonished at? It is easy to see you do not know much
      of him. All his friends are just like him; if you listen to them for half
      an hour at a stretch, you get regularly sick. When I think of the terrible
      evenings that I have spent in their company, I feel ready to die with
      yawning;" and as she spoke, she suited the action to the word. "Ah! if he
      really loved me!" added she.
    
    
      "Love you! Why, he adores you."
    
    
      Zora made a little gesture of contempt which Toto Chupin might have
      envied.
    
    
      "Do you think so?" said she. "Do you know what it is he loves in me? When
      people pass me they cry out, 'Isn't she good style?' and then the idiot is
      as pleased as Punch; but if I had on a cotton gown, he would think nothing
      of me."
    
    
      Rose had evidently learned a good ideal, as her beauty had never been so
      radiant. She was one glow of health and strength.
    
    
      "Then my name was not good enough for him," she went on. "His aristocratic
      lips could not bring themselves to utter such a common name as Rose, so he
      christened me Zora, a regular puppy dog's name. He has plenty of money,
      but money is not everything after all. Paul had no money, and yet I loved
      him a thousand times better. On my word, I have almost forgotten how to
      laugh, and yet I used to be as merry as the day was long."
    
    
      "Why did you leave Paul then?"
    
    
      "Well, you see, I wanted to experience what a woman feels when she has a
      Cashmere shawl on, so one fine morning I took wing. But there, who knows?
      Paul would very likely have left me one day. There was some one who was
      doing his best to separate us, an old blackguard called Tantaine, who
      lived in the same house."
    
    
      "Ah!" answered he cautiously. "What interest could he have had in
      separating you?"
    
    
      "I don't know," answered the girl, assuming a serious air; "but I am sure
      he was trying it on. A fellow doesn't hand over banknotes for nothing, and
      I saw him give one for five hundred francs to Paul; and more than that, he
      promised him that he should make a great fortune through a friend of his
      called Mascarin."
    
    
      Andre started. He remembered the visit that Paul had made him, on the
      pretext of restoring the twenty francs he had borrowed, and at which he
      had boasted that he had an income of a thousand francs a month, and might
      make more, though he had not said how this was to be done. "I think that
      Paul has forgotten me. I saw him once at Van Klopen's, and he never
      attempted to say a word to me. He was certainly with that Mascarin at the
      time."
    
    
      Andre could only draw one conclusion from this, either that Paul was
      protected by the band of conspirators, or else that he formed one of it.
      In that case he was useful to them; while Rose, who was in their way, was
      persecuted by them. Andre's mind came to this conclusion in an instant. It
      seemed to him that if Catenac had been desirous of imprisoning Rose, it
      was because she was in the way, and her presence disturbed certain
      combinations. Before, however, he could work out his line of deduction,
      Gaston's shrill voice was heard upon the stairs, and in another moment he
      made his appearance.
    
    
      "Place for the banquet," said he; "make way for the lordly feast."
    
    
      Two waiters followed him, bearing a number of covered dishes on trays. At
      another time Andre would have been very angry at this invasion, and at the
      prospect of a breakfast that would last two or three hours and utterly
      change everything; but now he was inclined to bless Gaston for his happy
      idea, and, with the assistance of Rose, he speedily cleared a large table
      for the reception of the viands.
    
    
      Gaston did nothing, but talked continually.
    
    
      "And now I must tell you the joke of the day. Henri de Croisenois, one of
      my dearest friends, has absolutely launched a Company."
    
    
      Andre nearly let fall a bottle, which he was about to place upon the
      table.
    
    
      "Who told you this?" asked he quickly.
    
    
      "Who told me? Why, a great big flaming poster. Tafila Copper Mines;
      capital, four millions. And my esteemed friend, Henri, has not a
      five-franc piece to keep the devil out of his pocket."
    
    
      The face of the young artist expressed such blank surprise that Gaston
      burst into a loud laugh.
    
    
      "You look just as I did when I read it. Henri de Croisenois, the chairman
      of a Company! Why, if you had been elected Pope, I should not have been
      more surprised. Tafila Copper Mines! What a joke! The shares are five
      hundred francs."
    
    
      The waiters had now retired, and Gaston urged his friends to take their
      places at the table, and all seemed merry as a marriage bell; but many a
      gay commencement has a stormy ending.
    
    
      Gaston, whose shallow brain could not stand the copious draughts of wine
      with which he washed down his repast, began all at once to overwhelm Zora
      with bitter reproaches at her not being able to comprehend how a man like
      him, who was destined to play a serious part in society, could have been
      led away, as he had been, by a person like her.
    
    
      Gaston had a tongue which was never at a loss either to praise or blame,
      and Zora was equally ready to retort, and defended herself with such
      acrimony that the lad, knowing himself to be in fault, entirely lost the
      small remnant of temper which he still possessed, and dashed out of the
      room, declaring that he never wished to set eyes upon Zora again, and that
      she might keep all the presents that he had lavished upon her for all he
      cared.
    
    
      His departure was hailed with delight by Andre, who, now that he was left
      alone with Zora, hoped to derive some further information from her, and
      especially a distinct description of Paul, whom he felt that he must now
      reckon among his adversaries. But his hopes were destined to be
      frustrated, for Zora was so filled with anger and excitement that she
      refused to listen to another word; and putting on her hat and mantle, with
      scarcely a glance at the mirror, rushed out of the studio with the utmost
      speed, declaring that she would seek out Paul, and make him revenge the
      insults that Gaston had put on her.
    
    
      All this passed so rapidly that the young painter felt as if a tornado had
      passed through his humble dwelling; but as peace and calm returned, he
      began to see that Providence had directly interposed in his favor, and had
      sent Rose and Gaston to his place to furnish him with fresh and important
      facts. All that Rose had said, incomplete as her statement was, had thrown
      a ray of light upon an intrigue which, up till now, had been shaded in the
      thickest gloom. The relations of Paul with Mascarin explained why Catenac
      had been so anxious to have Rose imprisoned, and also seemed to hint
      vaguely at the reason for the extraction of the forged signatures from the
      simple Gaston. What could be the meaning of the Company started by De
      Croisenois at the very moment when he was about to celebrate his union
      with Sabine?
    
    
      Andre desired to see the advertisement of the Company for himself; and
      without stopping to change his blouse, ran downstairs to the corner of the
      street, where Gaston had told him that the announcement of the Company was
      placarded up. He found it there, in a most conspicuous position, with all
      its advantages most temptingly set forth. Nothing was wanting; and there
      was even a woodcut of Tafila, in Algiers, which represented the copper
      mines in full working operation; while at the top, the name of the
      chairman, the Marquis de Croisenois, stood out in letters some six inches
      in height.
    
    
      Andre stood gazing at this wonderful production for fully five minutes,
      when all at once a gleam of prudence flashed across his mind.
    
    
      "I am a fool," said he to himself. "How do I know how many watchful eyes
      are now fixed on me, reading on my countenance my designs regarding this
      matter and its leading spirit?"
    
    
      Upon his return to his room, he sat for more than an hour, turning over
      the whole affair in his mind, and at length he flattered himself that he
      had hit upon an expedient. Behind the house in which he lodged was a large
      garden, belonging to some public institution, the front of which was in
      the Rue Laval. A wall of about seven feet in height divided these grounds
      from the premises in the Rue de la Tour d'Auvergne. Why should he not go
      out by the way of these ornamental grounds and so elude the vigilance of
      the spies who might be in waiting at the front of the house?
    
    
      "I can," thought he, "alter my appearance so much that I shall not be
      recognized. I need not return here to sleep. I can ask a bed from Vignol,
      who will help me in every possible way."
    
    
      This Vignol was the friend to whom, at Andre's request, M. Gandelu had
      given the superintendence of the works at his new house in the Champs
      Elysees.
    
    
      "I shall," continued he, "by this means escape entirely from De Croisenois
      and his emissaries, and can watch their game without their having any
      suspicion of my doing so. For the time being, of course, I must give up
      seeing those who have been helping me,       De Breulh, Gandelu, Madame de
      Bois Arden, and M. de Mussidan; that, however, cannot be avoided. I can
      use the post, and by it will inform them all of the step that I have
      taken."
    
    
      It was dark before he had finished his letters, and, of course, it was too
      late to try anything that day; consequently he went out, posted his
      letters, and dined at the nearest restaurant.
    
    
      On his return home, he proceeded to arrange his disguise. He had it ready,
      among his clothes: a blue blouse, a pair of check trousers, well-worn
      shoes, and a shabby cap, were all that he required, and he then applied
      himself to the task of altering his face. He first shaved off his beard.
      Then he twisted down two locks of hair, which he managed to make rest on
      his forehead. Then he commenced applying some coloring to his face with a
      paint-brush; but this he found to be an extremely difficult business, and
      it was not for a long while that he was satisfied with the results that he
      had produced. He then knotted an old handkerchief round his neck, and
      clapped his cap on one side, with the peak slanting over one eye. Then he
      took a last glance in the glass, and felt that he had rendered himself
      absolutely unrecognizable. He was about to impart a few finishing touches,
      when a knock came at his door. He was not expecting any one at such an
      hour, nine o'clock; for the waiters from the restaurant had already
      removed the remains of the feast.
    
    
      "Who is there?" cried he.
    
    
      "It is I," replied a weak voice; "I, Gaston de Gandelu."
    
    
      Andre decided that he had no cause to distrust the lad, and so he opened
      his door.
    
    
      "Has M. Andre gone out?" asked the poor boy faintly. "I though I heard his
      voice."
    
    
      Gaston had not penetrated his disguise, and this was Andre's first
      triumph; but he saw now that he must alter his voice, as well as his face.
    
    
      "Don't you know me?" asked he.
    
    
      It was evident that young Gaston had received some terrible shock; for it
      could not have been the quarrel in the morning that had reduced him to
      this abject state of prostration.
    
    
      "What has gone wrong with you?" asked Andre kindly.
    
    
      "I have come to bid you farewell; I am going to shoot myself in half an
      hour."
    
    
      "Have you gone mad?"
    
    
      "Not in the least," answered Gaston, passing his hand across his forehead
      in a distracted manner; "but those infernal bills have turned up. I was
      just leaving the dining-room, after having treated the governor to my
      company, when the butler whispered in my ear that there was a man outside
      who wanted to see me. I went out and found a dirty-looking old scamp, with
      his coat collar turned up round the nape of his neck."
    
    
      "Did he say that his name was Tantaine?" exclaimed Andre.
    
    
      "Ah! was that his name? Well, it doesn't matter. He told me in the most
      friendly manner that the holder of my bills had determined to place them
      in the hands of the police to-morrow at twelve o'clock, but that there was
      still a way for me to escape."
    
    
      "And this was to take Rose out of France with you," said Andre quickly.
    
    
      Gaston was overwhelmed with surprise.
    
    
      "Who the deuce told you that?" asked he.
    
    
      "No one; I guessed it; for it was only the conclusion of the plan which
      they had initiated when you were induced to forge Martin Rigal's
      signature. Well, what did you say?"
    
    
      "That the idea was a ridiculous one, and that I would not stir a yard.
      They shall find out that I can be obstinate, too; besides, I can see their
      little game. As soon as I am out of the way they will go to the governor
      and bleed him."
    
    
      But Andre was not listening to him. What was best to be done? To advise
      Gaston to go and take Rose with him was to deprive himself of a great
      element of success; and to permit him to kill himself was, of course, out
      of the question.
    
    
      "Just attend to me," said he at last; "I have an idea which I will tell
      you as soon as we are out of this house; but for reasons which are too
      long to go into at present it is necessary for me to get into the street
      without going through the door. You will, therefore, go away, and as the
      clock strikes twelve you will ring at the gateway of 29, Rue de Laval.
      When it is opened, ask some trivial question of the porter; and when you
      leave, take care that you do not close the gate. I shall be in the garden
      of the house and will slip out and join you."
    
    
      The plan succeeded admirably, and in ten minutes Gaston and Andre were
      walking along the boulevards.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XXXII.
    
    
      M. LECOQ.
    
    
      The Marquis de Croisenois lived in a fine new house on the Boulevard
      Malesherbes near the church of St. Augustine, and in a suite of rooms the
      rental of which was four thousand francs per annum. He had collected
      together sufficient relics of his former splendor to dazzle the eyes of
      the superficial observer. The apartment and the furniture stood in the
      name of his body-servant, while his horse and brougham were by the same
      fiction supposed to be the property of his coachman, for even in the midst
      of his ruin the Marquis de Croisenois could not go on foot like common
      people.
    
    
      The Marquis had two servants only in his modest establishment       a
      coachman, who did a certain amount of indoor work, and a valet, who knew
      enough of cookery to prepare a bachelor breakfast. This valet Mascarin had
      seen once, and the man had then produced so unpleasant an impression on
      the astute proprietor of the Servants' Registry Office that he had set
      every means at work to discover who he was and from whence he came.
      Croisenois said that he had taken him into his service on the
      recommendation of an English baronet of his acquaintance, a certain Sir
      Richard Wakefield. The man was a Frenchman, but he had resided for some
      time in England, for he spoke that language with tolerable fluency. Andre
      knew nothing of these details, but he had heard of the existence of the
      valet from M. de Breulh, when he had asked where the Marquis lived.
    
    
      At eight o'clock on the morning after he had surreptitiously left his home
      in the manner described, Andre took up his position in a small wine-shop
      not far from the abode of the Marquis de Croisenois. He had done this
      designedly, for he knew enough of the manner and customs of Parisian
      society to know that this was the hour usually selected by domestics in
      fashionable quarters to come out for a gossip while their masters were
      still in bed. Andre had more confidence in himself than heretofore, for he
      had succeeded in saving Gaston; and these were the means he had employed.
      After much trouble, and even by the use of threats, he had persuaded the
      boy to return to his father's house. He had gone with him; and though it
      was two in the morning, he had not hesitated to arouse M. Gandelu, senior,
      and tell him how his son had been led on to commit the forgery, and how he
      threatened to commit suicide.
    
    
      The poor old man was much moved.
    
    
      "Tell him to come to me at once," said he, "and let him know that we two
      will save him."
    
    
      Andre had not far to go, for Gaston was waiting in the next room in an
      agony of suspense.
    
    
      As soon as he came into the old man's presence he fell upon his knees,
      with many promises of amendment for the future.
    
    
      "I do not believe," remarked old Gandelu, "that these miscreants will
      venture to carry their threats into execution and place the matter in the
      hands of the police; but for all that, my son must not remain in a state
      of suspense. I will file a complaint against the Mutual Loan Society
      before twelve to-day, and we will see how an association will be dealt
      with that lends money to minors and urges them to forge signatures as
      security. It will, however, be as well for my son to leave for Belgium by
      the first train this morning; but, as you will see, he will not remain
      very many days."
    
    
      Andre remained for the rest of the hours of darkness at the kind old man's
      house, and it was in Gaston's room that he renewed his "make-up" before
      leaving. The future looked very bright to him as he walked gayly up the
      Boulevard Malesherbes. The wine-shop in which he had taken up his position
      was admirably adapted for keeping watch on De Croisenois, for he could not
      avoid seeing all who came in and went out of the house; and as there was
      no other wine-shop in the neighborhood, Andre felt sure that all the
      servants in the vicinity, and those of the Marquis, of course, among the
      number, would come there in the course of the morning; so that here he
      could get into conversation with them, offer them a glass of wine, and,
      perhaps, get some information from them. The room was large and airy, and
      was full of customers, most of whom were servants. Andre was racking his
      brain for a means of getting into conversation with the proprietor, when
      two new-comers entered the room. These men were in full livery, while all
      the other servants had on morning jackets. As soon as they entered, an old
      man, with a calm expression of face, who was struggling perseveringly with
      a tough beefsteak at the same table as that by which Andre was seated,
      observed,       
    
    
      "Ah! here comes the De Croisenois' lot."
    
    
      "If they would only sit here," thought Andre, "by the side of this fellow,
      who evidently knows them, I could hear all they said."
    
    
      By good luck they did so, begging that they might be served at once, as
      they were in a tremendous hurry.
    
    
      "What is the haste this morning?" asked the old man who had recognized
      them.
    
    
      "I have to drive the master to his office, for he has one now. He is
      chairman of a Copper Mining Company, and a fine thing it is, too. If you
      have any money laid by, M. Benoit, this is a grand chance for you."
    
    
      Benoit shook his head gravely.
    
    
      "All is not gold that glitters," said he sententiously; "nor, on the other
      hand, are things as bad as they are painted."
    
    
      Benoit was evidently a prudent man, and was not likely to commit himself.
    
    
      "But if your master is going out, you, M. Mouret, will be free, and we can
      have a game at cards together."
    
    
      "No, sir," answered the valet.
    
    
      "What! are you engaged too?"
    
    
      "Yes; I have to carry a bouquet of flowers to the young lady my master is
      engaged to. I have seen the young lady; she seems to be rather haughty."
    
    
      The man, who wore an enormously high and stiff collar, was absolutely
      speaking of Sabine, and Andre could have twisted his neck with pleasure.
    
    
      "Let us hope," remarked the coachman, as he hastily swallowed his
      breakfast, "that the Marquis does not intend to invest his wife's dowry in
      this new venture of his."
    
    
      The men then ceased to speak of their master, and began to busy themselves
      with their own affairs, and went out again without alluding to him any
      further, leaving Andre to reflect what a difficult business the detective
      line was.
    
    
      The customers looked upon him with distrustful eyes, for it must be
      confessed that his appearance was decidedly against him, and he had not
      yet acquired the necessary art of seeing and hearing while affecting to be
      doing neither; and it was easy for the dullest observer to be certain that
      it was not for the sake of obtaining a breakfast that he had entered the
      establishment. Andre had penetration enough to see the effect he had
      produced, and he became more and more embarrassed. He had finished his
      meal now and had lighted a cigar, and had ordered a small glass of brandy.
      Nearly all the customers had withdrawn, leaving only five or six, who were
      playing cards at a table near the door. Andre was anxious to see
      Croisenois enter his carriage, and so he lingered, ordering another glass
      of brandy as an excuse.
    
    
      He had just been served, when a man, whose dress very much resembled his
      own, lounged into the wine-shop. He was a tall, clumsily built fellow,
      with an insolent expression upon his beardless face. His coat and cap were
      in an equally dilapidated condition; and in the squeaky voice of the
      rough, he ordered a plate of beef and half a bottle of wine, and, as he
      brushed past Andre, upset his glass of brandy. The artist made no remark,
      though he felt quite sure that this act was intentional, as the fellow
      laughed impudently when he saw the damage that he had done. When his
      breakfast was served, he carelessly spit upon Andre's boots. The insult
      was so apparent that Andre began to reflect.
    
    
      "Had he not succeeded in eluding his spies, as he thought that he had
      done? And was it not quite possible that this man had been sent to pick a
      quarrel with him, and deal him a disabling, or even a fatal blow?"
    
    
      Prudence counselled him to leave the place at once, but he felt that he
      could not go until he had found out the real truth. There seemed to be but
      little doubt on the matter, however; for as the fellow cut up his meat, he
      jerked every bit of skin and gristle into his neighbor's lap; then, after
      finishing up his wine, he managed to upset the few drops remaining on to
      Andre's arm and shoulder. This was the finishing stroke.
    
    
      "Please, remember," remarked Andre calmly, "that there is some one at the
      table besides yourself."
    
    
      "Do you think I'm blind, mate?" returned the fellow brutally. "Mind your
      own business, or              " And to conclude the sentence, he shook his
      fist threateningly in the young man's face.
    
    
      Andre started to his feet, and, with a well-directed blow in the chest,
      sent the fellow rolling under the table.
    
    
      At the sound of the scuffle, the card-players turned round, and saw Andre
      standing erect, with quivering lips and eyes flashing with rage, while his
      antagonist was lying on the floor among the overturned chairs.
    
    
      "Come, come! No squabbling here!" remarked one of the players.
    
    
      The fellow scrambled to his feet, and made a savage rush at the young man,
      who, using his right foot skilfully, tripped his antagonist up, and sent
      him again rolling on the ground. It was most adroitly done, and secured
      the applause of the lookers-on, who now complained no longer, and were
      evidently interested in the scene.
    
    
      Again the rough came up, but Andre contented himself with standing on the
      defensive. Some tables, a stool, and a glass were injured, and at last the
      proprietor came upon the scene of action.
    
    
      "Get out of this," cried he, "and take care that I don't see your faces
      here again."
    
    
      At these words, the rough burst out into a torrent of foul language.
    
    
      "Don't put up with his cheek," said one of the customers; "give him in
      charge at once."
    
    
      Hardly, however, had the manager started to summon the police, than, as if
      by magic, a body of them appeared; and Andre found himself walking down
      the boulevard between a couple, while his late antagonist followed in the
      safe custody of two more. To have attempted any resistance would have been
      utter folly, and the young man resigned himself to what he felt he could
      not help. But as he went on, he reflected on the strange scene through
      which he had just passed. All had gone on so rapidly that he could hardly
      recall the events to his memory. He was, however, quite sure that this
      unprovoked assault concealed some motive with which at present he was
      unacquainted.
    
    
      The police led their prisoners through the doorway of a dingy-looking old
      house, and then Andre saw that he was not at the regular police-station.
      The whole party entered an office, where a superintendent and two clerks
      were at work. The ruffian who had assaulted Andre changed his manner
      directly he entered the office; he threw his tattered cap upon a bench,
      passed his fingers through his hair, and shook hands with the
      superintendent; he then turned to Andre.
    
    
      "Permit me, sir," said he, "to compliment you on being so handy with your
      fists. You precious nearly did for me, I can tell you."
    
    
      At that moment a door opened at the other end of the room, and a voice was
      heard to say, "Send them in."
    
    
      Andre and his late antagonist soon found themselves in an office evidently
      sacred to some one high up in the police. At a desk near the window was
      seated a man, with a rather distinguished air, wearing a white necktie and
      a pair of gold glasses.
    
    
      "Have the goodness to take a seat," said this gentleman, addressing Andre
      with the most perfect urbanity.
    
    
      He took a chair, half stupefied by the strangeness of the whole affair,
      and waited. Could he be awake, or was he dreaming? He could hardly tell.
    
    
      "Before I say anything," remarked the gentleman in the gold spectacles, "I
      ought to apologize for a proceeding which is       well, what shall I call
      it?       a little rough, perhaps; but it was necessary to make use of it
      to obtain this interview with you. Really, however, I had no choice. You
      are closely watched, and I did not wish the persons who had set spies on
      you to have any knowledge of this conference."
    
    
      "Do you say I am watched?" stammered Andre.
    
    
      "Yes, by a certain La Candele, as sharp a fellow at that kind of work as
      you could find in Paris. Are you surprised at this?"
    
    
      "Yes, for I had thought              "
    
    
      The gentleman's features softened into a benevolent smile.
    
    
      "You thought," he said, "that you had succeeded in throwing them off the
      scent. So I had imagined this morning, when I saw you in your present
      disguise. But permit me, my dear M. Andre, to assure you that there is
      great room for improvement in it. I admit that a first attempt is always
      to be looked on leniently; but it did not deceive La Candele, and even at
      this distance I can plainly see your whole makeup; and what I can see, of
      course, is patent to others."
    
    
      He rose from his seat, and came closer to Andre.
    
    
      "Why on earth," asked he, "should you daub all this color on your face,
      which makes you look like an Indian warrior in his war-paint? Only two
      colors are necessary to change the whole face       red and black       at
      the eyebrows, the nostrils, and the corners of the mouth. Look here;" and
      taking from his pocket a gold pencil-case, he corrected the faults in the
      young artist's work.
    
    
      As soon as he had finished, Andre went up to the mirror over the
      chimney-piece, and was surprised at the result.
    
    
      "Now," said the strange gentleman, "you see the futility of your attempts.
      La Candele knew you at once. I wished to speak to you; so I sent for
      Palot, one of my men, and instructed him to pick a quarrel with you. The
      policemen arrested you, and we have met without any one being at all the
      wiser. Be kind enough to efface my little corrections, as they will be
      noticed in the street."
    
    
      Andre obeyed, and as he rubbed away with the corner of his handkerchief,
      he vainly sought for some elucidation of this mystery.
    
    
      The man with the gold spectacles had resumed his seat, and was refreshing
      himself with a pinch of snuff.
    
    
      "And now," resumed he, "we will, if you please, have a little talk
      together. As you see, I know you. Doctor Loulleux tells me that he knows
      no one so high-minded and amiable as yourself. He declares that your honor
      is without a stain, and your courage undoubted."
    
    
      "Ah! my dear sir!" interposed the painter, with a deep blush.
    
    
      "Pray let me go on. M. Gandelu says that he would trust you with all he
      possessed, while all your comrades, with Vignol at their head, have the
      greatest respect and regard for you. So much for the present. As for your
      future, two of the greatest ornaments of the artistic world say that you
      will one day occupy a very high place in the profession. You gain now
      about fifteen francs a day. Am I correct?"
    
    
      "Certainly," answered Andre, more bewildered than ever.
    
    
      The gentleman smiled.
    
    
      "Unfortunately," he went on, "my information ends here, for the means of
      inquiry possessed by the police are, of course, very limited. They can
      only act upon facts, not on intentions, and so long as these are not
      displayed in open acts, the hands of the police are tied. It is only
      forty-eight hours since I heard of you for the first time, and I have
      already your biography in my pocket. I hear that the day before yesterday
      you were dining with M. de Breulh-Faverlay, and that this morning you were
      walking with young Gandelu, and that La Candele was following you like a
      shadow. These are all facts, but              "
    
    
      He paused, and cast a keen glance upon Andre, then, in a slow and measured
      voice, he continued,       
    
    
      "But no one has been able to tell me why you dogged Verminet's footsteps,
      or why you went to Mascarin's house, or why, finally, you disguised
      yourself to keep a watch on the movements of the most honorable the
      Marquis de Croisenois. It is the motive that we cannot arrive at, for the
      facts are perfectly clear."
    
    
      Andre fidgeted uneasily in his chair beneath the spell of those magnetic
      glasses, which seemed to draw the truth from him.
    
    
      "I cannot tell you, sir," faltered he at last, "for the secret is not mine
      to divulge."
    
    
      "You will not trust me? Well, then, I must speak. Remember, all that I
      have told you was the account of what I knew positively; but, in addition
      to this, I have drawn my own inferences. You are watching De Croisenois
      because he is going to marry a wealthy heiress."
    
    
      Andre blushed crimson.
    
    
      "We assume, therefore, that you wish to prevent this marriage; and why,
      pray? I have heard that Mademoiselle de Mussidan was formerly engaged to
      M. de Breulh-Faverlay. How comes it that the Count and Countess de
      Mussidan prefer a ruined spendthrift to a wealthy and strictly honorable
      man? It is for you to answer this question. It is perfectly plain to me
      that they hand over their daughter to De Croisenois under pressure of some
      kind, and that means that a terrible secret exists with which Croisenois
      threatens them."
    
    
      "Your deduction is wrong, sir," exclaimed Andre eagerly, "and you are
      quite wrong."
    
    
      "Very good," was the calm reply. "Your emphatic denial shows that I am in
      the right. I want no further proofs. M. de Mussidan paid you a visit
      yesterday, and one of my agents reported that his face was much happier on
      leaving you than when he was on his way to your house. I therefore infer
      that you promised to release him from Croisenois' persecutions, and in
      return he promised you his daughter's hand in marriage. This, of course,
      explains your present disguise, and now tell me again that I am wrong, if
      you dare."
    
    
      Andre would not lie, and therefore kept silence.
    
    
      "And now," continued the gentleman, "how about the secret? Did not the
      Count tell it you? I do not know it; and yet I think that if I were to
      search for it, I could find it. I can call to my mind certain crimes which
      three generations of detective have striven to find out. Did you ever hear
      that De Croisenois had an elder brother named George, who disappeared in a
      most wonderful manner? What became of him? This very George, twenty-three
      years back, was a friend of Madame de Mussidan's. Might not his
      disappearance have something to do with this marriage?"
    
    
      "Are you the fiend himself?" cried the young man.
    
    
      "I am M. Lecoq."
    
    
      Andre started back in absolute dread at the name of this celebrated
      detective.
    
    
      "M. Lecoq!" repeated he.
    
    
      The vanity of the great detective was much flattered when he saw the
      impression that his name had produced.
    
    
      "And now, my dear M. Andre," said he blandly, "now that you know who I am,
      may I not hope that you will be more communicative?"
    
    
      M. de Mussidan had not told his secret to the young artist, but he had
      said enough for him to feel that the detective was correct in his
      inference.
    
    
      "Surely," continued Lecoq, "we ought to be able to come to a more definite
      understanding, and I think that my openness should elicit some frankness
      on your side. I saw that you were watched by the very person that I was
      watching. For three days my men have followed you, and to-day I made up my
      mind that you could furnish me with the clue I am seeking."
    
    
      "I, sir?"
    
    
      "For many years," continued Lecoq, "I have been certain that an organized
      association of blackmailers exists in Paris; family differences, sin,
      shame, and sorrow are worked by these wretches like veritable gold mines,
      and bring them in enormous annual revenues."
    
    
      "Ah," returned Andre, "I expected something of this kind."
    
    
      "Of course, when I was quite sure of these facts," continued Lecoq, "I
      said to myself, 'I will break up this gang;' but it was easier said than
      done. There is one very peculiar thing about blackmailing. Those who carry
      it on are almost certain of doing so with impunity, for the victims will
      pay and not complain. Yes, I tell you that I have often found out these
      unhappy pigeons, but never could get one to speak."
    
    
      The detective was so indignant and acrimonious withal in his indignation,
      that Andre could not repress a smile.
    
    
      "Very soon," continued Lecoq, "I recognized the futility of my attempts,
      and the impossibility of reaching these scoundrels through their victims,
      and then I determined to strike at the plunderers themselves, but this was
      a scheme that took patience and time. I have waited my chance for three
      years, and for eighteen months one of my men has been in the service of
      the Marquis de Croisenois, and up to now this band of villains has cost
      the government over ten thousand francs. That superlative scoundrel,
      Mascarin, has put several white threads in my hair. I believe him to be
      Tantaine; yes, and Martin Rigal too. The idea of there being a means of
      communication between the banker's house in the Rue Montmartre and the
      Servants' Registry Office in the Rue Montorgueil only came into my head
      this morning. But this time they have gone too far, and I have them. I
      know them all, from the chief, Mascarin-Tantaine-Rigal, down to their
      lowest agent, Toto Chupin, and Paul Violaine, the docile puppet of their
      will. We will get hold of the whole gang, and neither Van Klopen nor
      Catenac will escape. Just now the latter is travelling about with the Duke
      de Champdoce and a fellow named Perpignan, and two of my sweet lads are
      close upon them, and send in almost hourly reports of what is going on. My
      trap has a tempting bait, the spring is strong, and we shall catch every
      one of them. And now do you still hesitate to confide all you know to me?
      I swear on my honor that I will respect as sacred what you tell me, no
      matter what may occur."
    
    
      Andre yielded, as did every person who came under the influence of this
      remarkable man and his strange and inexplicable fascination. If he hid
      anything from him to-day, would not Lecoq be acquainted with it to-morrow?
      And so, with the most perfect frankness, he told his story and everything
      that he knew.
    
    
      "Now," cried Lecoq, "I see it all clearly. Aha, they want to force young
      Gandelu to disappear with Rose, do they?"
    
    
      Beneath his gold-rimmed spectacles his eyes flashed fiercely. He seemed to
      be occupied in drawing out his plan of campaign.
    
    
      "From this moment," said he, "be at ease. In another month Mademoiselle de
      Mussidan shall be your wife; this I promise you, and the promises of Lecoq
      are never broken."
    
    
      He paused for an instant, as though to collect his thoughts, and then
      continued,       
    
    
      "I can answer for all, except for your life. So many are interested in
      your disappearance from this world, that every effort will be made to get
      rid of you. Do not cease your caution for an instant. Never eat twice
      running at the same restaurant, throw away food that has the slightest
      strange taste. Avoid crowds in the street; do not get into a cab; never
      lean from a window before ascertaining that its supports are solid; in a
      word, fear and suspect everything."
    
    
      For a moment longer Lecoq detained the young artist.
    
    
      "Tell me," said he, "have you the mark of a wound on your shoulder or
      arm?"
    
    
      "I have, sir; the scar of a very severe scald."
    
    
      "I thought so; yes, I was almost certain of it," said Lecoq thoughtfully;
      and as he conducted the young man to the door, he took leave of him with
      the same words that Mascarin had often used to Paul,       
    
    
      "Farewell for the present, Duke de Champdoce."
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XXXIII.
    
    
      THROUGH THE AIR.
    
    
      At these last words Andre turned round, but the door closed, and he heard
      the key grate in the lock. He passed through the outer office, where the
      superintendent, his two clerks, and his late adversary all seemed to gaze
      upon him with a glance of admiration and esteem.
    
    
      He gained the open street.
    
    
      What did those last words of Lecoq mean? He was a foundling, it is true;
      but what foundling has not had lofty aspirations, and felt that, for all
      he knew, he might be the scion of some noble house.
    
    
      As soon as Lecoq thought that the coast was clear, he opened the door, and
      called the agent, Palot.
    
    
      "My lad," said the great man, "you saw that young man who went out just
      now? He is a noble fellow, full of good feeling and honor. I look upon him
      as my friend."
    
    
      Palot made a gesture signifying that henceforth his late antagonist was as
      something sacred in his eyes.
    
    
      "You will be his shadow," pursued Lecoq, "and keep near enough to him to
      rush to his aid at a moment of danger. That gang, of which Mascarin is the
      head, want his life. You are my right-hand man, and I trust him to you. I
      have warned him, but youth is rash; and you will scent danger where he
      would never dream that it lurked. If there is any peril, dash boldly
      forward, but endeavor to let no one find out who you are. If you must
      speak to him       but only do so at the last extremity       whisper my
      name in his ear, and he will know you have come from me. Remember, you are
      answerable for him; but change your face. La Candele and the others must
      not recognize in you the wine-shop bully; that would spoil all. What have
      you on under that blouse, a commissionaire's dress?
    
    
      "That will do; now change the face."
    
    
      Palot pulled out a small parcel from his pocket, from which he extracted a
      red beard and wig, and, going to the mirror, adjusted them with dexterous
      activity; and, in a few minutes, went up to his master, who was waiting,
      saying,       
    
    
      "How will this do?"
    
    
      "Not bad, not bad," returned Lecoq; "and now to your work."
    
    
      "Where shall I find him?" asked Palot.
    
    
      "Somewhere near Mascarin's den, for I advised him not to give up playing
      the spy too suddenly."
    
    
      Palot was off like the wind, and when he reached the Rue Montmartre, he
      caught sight of the person who had been intrusted to his care.
    
    
      Andre was walking slowly along, thinking of Lecoq's cautions, when a young
      man, with his arm in a sling, overtook him, going in the same direction as
      he was. Andre was sure that it was Paul, and as he knew that he could not
      be recognized, he passed him in his turn, and saw that it was indeed the
      Paul so much regretted by Zora.
    
    
      "I will find out where he goes to," thought Andre.
    
    
      He followed, and saw him enter the house of M. Rigal. Two women were
      gossiping near the door, and Andre heard one of them say,       
    
    
      "That is the young fellow who is going to marry Flavia, the banker's
      daughter."
    
    
      Paul, therefore, was to marry the daughter of the chief of the gang.
      Should he tell Lecoq this? But, of course, the detective knew it.
    
    
      Time was passing, and Andre felt that he had but little space to gain the
      house that Gandelu was building in the Champs Elysees, if he wished to ask
      hospitality from his friend Vignol.
    
    
      He found all the workmen there, and not one of them recognized him when he
      asked for Vignol.
    
    
      "He is engaged up there," said one. "Take the staircase to the left."
    
    
      The chief part of the ornamental work was in front, and it was there that
      the little hut which Tantaine had pointed out to Toto Chupin was erected.
      Vignol was in it, and was utterly surprised when Andre made himself known,
      for he did not recognize him under his strange disguise.
    
    
      "It is nothing," returned the young man cautiously, as Vignol paused for
      an explanation; "only a little love affair."
    
    
      "Do you expect to win a girl's heart by making such a guy of yourself?"
      asked his friend with a laugh.
    
    
      "Hush! I will explain matters later on. Can you give me shelter for a
      night or two?"
    
    
      He stopped himself, turned terribly pale, and listened intently. He
      fancied he had heard a woman's scream, and his own name uttered.
    
    
      "Andre, it is I       your Sabine; help!"
    
    
      Quick as lightning Andre rushed to the window, opened it, and leaned out
      to discover from whence those sounds came.
    
    
      The young miscreant, Toto Chupin, had too fatally earned the note with
      which Tantaine had bribed him. The whole of the front of the window gave
      way with a loud crash, and Andre was hurled into space.
    
    
      The hut was at least sixty feet from the pavement, and the fall was the
      more appalling because the body of Andre struck some of the intervening
      scaffolding first, and thence bounced off, until the unhappy young man
      fell with a dull thud, bleeding and senseless in the street.
    
    
      Nearly three hundred persons in the Champs Elysees witnessed this hideous
      sight; for, at Vignol's cry, every one had stopped, and, frozen with
      horror, had not missed one detail of the grim tragedy.
    
    
      In an instant a crowd was collected round the poor, inert mass of humanity
      which lay motionless in a pool of blood. But two workmen, roused by
      Vignol's shrieks, were soon on the spot, and pushed their way through the
      crowd of persons who were gazing with a morbid curiosity on the man who
      had fallen from a height of sixty feet.
    
    
      Andre gave no sign of life. His face was dreadfully bruised, his eyes were
      closed, and a stream of blood poured from his mouth, as Vignol raised his
      friend's head upon his knee.
    
    
      "He is dead!" cried the lookers on. "No one could survive such a fall."
    
    
      "Let us take him to the Hospital Beaujon!" exclaimed Vignol. "We are close
      by there."
    
    
      An ambulance was speedily procured, and the workmen, placing their
      insensible friend carefully in it, asked permission to carry him to the
      hospital.
    
    
      One curious event had excited the attention of some of the lookers on.
      Just as Andre fell, a commissaire had rushed forward and seized a
      woman. She was one of the class of unfortunates who frequent the Champs
      Elysees, and she it was who had uttered the cry that had lured Andre to
      destruction. The woman made an effort to escape, but Palot, for it was he,
      caught her arm.
    
    
      "Not a word," said he sternly. The wretched creature seemed in abject
      terror, and obeyed him.
    
    
      "Why did you cry out?" asked he.
    
    
      "I do not know."
    
    
      "It is a lie!"
    
    
      "No, it is true; a gentleman came up to me, and said, 'Madame, if you will
      cry out now, Andre, it is I       your Sabine; help! I will give you two
      louis.' Of course I agreed. He gave me the fifty francs, and I did as he
      asked me."
    
    
      "What was this man like?"
    
    
      "He was tall, old, and very shabby and dirty, with glasses on. I never set
      eyes on him before."
    
    
      "Do you know," returned the commissaire sternly, "that the words
      you have uttered have caused the death of the poor fellow who has just
      fallen from the house?"
    
    
      "Why did he not take more care?" asked she indifferently.
    
    
      Palot, with an angry gesture, handed her over to a police-constable.
    
    
      "Take her to the station-house," said he, "and do not lose sight of her,
      for she will be a most important witness at a trial that must soon come
      on."
    
    
      "What the woman says is true," muttered Palot. "She did not know what she
      was doing, and it was Tantaine that gave her the two coins. He shall pay
      for this; but certainly, if the whole gang are collared, it won't bring
      the poor young fellow to life."
    
    
      He had, however, not much time for reflection, for he had to gather up
      every link of evidence. How was it that this accident had occurred? The
      frame of the window had fallen out with Andre, and lay in fragments on the
      pavement. He picked up one of the pieces, and at once saw what had been
      done; the woodwork had been sawed almost in two, and the putty with which
      the marks of the cuts had been concealed still clung to the wood. Palot
      called one of the workmen, who appeared to be more intelligent than his
      fellows, pointed out the marks to him, and bade him gather up the
      fragments and put them in some place of security. This duty being
      accomplished, Palot joined the crowd; but he was too late, for Andre had
      been taken away to the hospital. He looked around to see if there was any
      one from whom he could gain information, and suddenly perceived on a bench
      some one whom he had often followed. It was Toto Chupin, no longer clad in
      the squalid rags of a day or two back. He was dressed in gorgeous array,
      but his face was livid, his eyes wild, and his lips kept moving
      convulsively, for he was a victim to a novel sensation       the pangs of
      remorse       and was meditating whether he should not go to the nearest
      police-station and give himself up, so that he might revenge himself on
      Tantaine, who had made him a murderer. For a moment the idea of arresting
      Toto passed through Palot's mind, but he, after a moment's thought,
      muttered,       
    
    
      "No; that would never do. We should risk losing the whole gang. Besides,
      he can't get away. I may even have committed an error in arresting that
      woman. My master will say that I am not to be trusted. He placed one of
      his friends in my charge, and this is what has happened. I knew that the
      young man's life was in deadly peril, and yet I let him enter a house in
      the course of erection; why, I might as well have cut his throat myself."
    
    
      In a terrible state of anxiety, Palot presented himself at the hospital,
      and asked for the young man who had just been brought in.
    
    
      "You mean Number 17?" returned one of the assistant-surgeons. "He is in a
      most critical state; we fear internal injuries, fracture of the skull, and       in
      fact, we fear everything."
    
    
      It was two days before Andre recovered consciousness. It was midnight when
      he first woke again to the realities of life. At a glance he guessed where
      he was. He felt pain when he endeavored to turn over, but he could move
      his legs and one arm.
    
    
      "How long have I been here, I wonder?" he thought.
    
    
      He tried to think, but he was weak, and thoughts would not come at his
      command, and in a few seconds he dropped off to sleep again; and when he
      awoke, it was broad day; the ward was full of life and motion, for it was
      the hour of the house surgeon's visit. He was a young man still, with a
      cheerful face, followed by the band of students. He went from bed to bed,
      explaining cases, and cheering up the sufferers. When Andre's turn came,
      the surgeon told him that his shoulder was put out, his arm broken in two
      places, a bad cut on his head, while his body was one mass of bruises;
      but, for all that, he was in luck to have got off so easily. Andre
      listened to him with but a vague understanding of his meaning, for, with
      the return of reason, the remembrance of Sabine had come, and he asked
      himself what would become of her while he was confined to his bed in the
      hospital. As this thought passed through his mind, he uttered a faint
      groan. One of the students, a stout person, with red whiskers, a white
      tie, and a rather shabby hat, who looked as if he had just arrived from
      the country, stepped up to his bed, and leaning over the patient,
      murmured, "Lecoq." Andre opened his eyes wide at the name.
    
    
      "M. Lecoq," gasped he, wondering at the excellence of the disguise.
    
    
      "Hush, who knows who is watching us? I come to give your mind ease, which
      will do you more good than all the doctor's stuff. Without in any way
      committing you, I have seen M. de Mussidan, and have furnished him with a
      valid excuse for postponing his daughter's marriage for another month. You
      must remain here; you could not be in a place of greater security; but
      even here you cannot be too cautious. Eat nothing that is no given you by
      some one who utters the word 'Lecoq.' M. Gandelu will certainly call to
      see you. If you want to see or write to me, the patient on your right will
      manage that; he is one of my men. You shall have news every day; but be
      patient and prudent."
    
    
      "I can wait now," answered the young man, "because I have hope."
    
    
      "Ah," murmured Lecoq, as he moved softly away, "is not hope the true
      secret of life and happiness?"
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XXXIV.
    
    
      THE DAY OF RECKONING.
    
    
      M. Lecoq enjoined prudence and caution on Andre, and the utmost care on
      the part of his agents, because he was fully aware of the skill and
      cunning of the adversary with whom he had to cope.
    
    
      "You should not talk or make a noise," he would say, "when you are
      fighting."
    
    
      He could now prove that the head of this association, the man who
      concealed his identity under a threefold personality, was the instigator
      of a murder. But he did not intend to make use of this discovery at once,
      for he had sworn that he would take the whole gang, and his proceedings
      had been so carefully conducted that his victims did not for a moment
      suspect the net that was closing around them. The day after the accident
      to Andre, Mascarin sent an anonymous communication to the head of the
      police, giving up Toto as the author of the crime, and saying where he
      could be found.
    
    
      "Of course," thought this wily plotter, "Toto will denounce Tantaine, but
      that worthy man is dead and buried, and I think that even the sharpest
      agents of the police will be unable to effect his resurrection."
    
    
      Mascarin had carefully consumed in a large fire every particle of the
      tattered garments that Tantaine had been in the habit of wearing, and
      laughed merrily as he watched the columns of sombre smoke roll upwards.
    
    
      "Look for him as much as you please," laughed he. "Old Daddy Tantaine has
      flown up the chimney."
    
    
      The next business was to suppress Mascarin; this was a more difficult
      operation. Few would care to inquire about Tantaine, but Mascarin was well
      known as the head of a prosperous business; his disappearance would create
      a sensation, and the police would take up the matter. His best course
      would be to conduct matters openly, and sell his business on the plea of
      family affairs causing him to retire. He easily found a purchaser, and in
      twenty-four hours the matter had been arranged.
    
    
      The night before handing over the business to his successor Mascarin had
      much to do. Assisted by Beaumarchef, he carried into Martin Rigal's
      private office the papers with which the Registry Office was crammed. This
      removal was effected by means of a door marked by a panel between
      Mascarin's office and the banker's private room; and when the last scrap
      of paper had been removed, Mascarin pointed out a heap of bricks and a
      supply of mortar to his faithful adherent.
    
    
      "Wall up this door," said he.
    
    
      It was a long and wearisome task, but it was at length completed, and by
      rubbing soot and dust over the new work it lost its appearance of
      freshness. The evening before Beaumarchef had received twelve thousand
      francs on the express condition that he would start at once for America,
      and the leave-taking between him and the master he had so faithfully
      served was a most affecting one. He knew hardly anything of the diabolical
      plots going on around him, and was the only innocent person in that house
      of crime.
    
    
      Mascarin was in haste to depart; he had annihilated Tantaine in order to
      free himself from Toto. Mascarin was about to disappear, and he
      contemplated retaining his third personality, and in it to pass away the
      remainder of his life honored and respected; but he must first induct his
      successor into his business; and he went through the books with him, and
      explained all the practical working of the machinery. This took him nearly
      all day, and it was getting late when his luggage was put on a cab which
      he had in waiting. A new plate had already been placed on the door: "J.
      Robinet, late B. Mascarin."
    
    
      Knowing that he must carry out the deception completely, Mascarin drove to
      the western railway station, and took a ticket for Rouen. He felt rather
      uncomfortable, for he feared that he was being watched, and he made up his
      mind not to leave a single trace behind him. At Rouen he abandoned his
      luggage, which he had taken care should afford no clue as to ownership, he
      also relinquished his beard and spectacles, and returned to Paris as the
      well-known banker, Martin Rigal, the pretty Flavia's father, having, as he
      thought, obliterated Mascarin as completely as he had done Tantaine; but
      he had not noticed in the train with him a very dark young man with
      piercing eyes, who looked like the traveller of some respectable
      commercial firm. As soon as he reached his home, and had tenderly embraced
      his daughter, he went to the private room of Martin Rigal, and opened it
      with the key that never left his person, and then gazed at a large rough
      mass of brickwork which disfigured one side of the room, and which was the
      remains of the wall that erewhile had been so hastily erected in the
      Office of the Servants' Registry.
    
    
      "This won't do," muttered he; "it must be plastered, and then repapered."
    
    
      He picked up the bits of brick and plaster that lay on the floor, and
      threw them into the fire, and then pushed a large screen in front of the
      rough brickwork. He had just finished his work when Hortebise entered the
      room, with his perpetually smiling face.
    
    
      "Now, you unbeliever," cried Mascarin gaily, "is not fortune within our
      grasp? Tantaine and Mascarin are dead, or rather, they never existed.
      Beaumarchef is on his way to America, La Candele will be in London in a
      week, and now we may enjoy our millions."
    
    
      "Heaven grant it," said the doctor piously.
    
    
      "Pooh, pooh! we have nothing more to fear, as you would have known had you
      gone into the case as thoroughly as I have done. Who was the enemy whom we
      had most need to dread? Why, Andre. He certainly is not dead, but he is
      laid up for some weeks, and that is enough. Besides, he has given up the
      game, for one of my men who managed to get into the hospital says that he
      has not received a visitor or dispatched a letter for the last fifteen
      days."
    
    
      "But he had friends."
    
    
      "Pshaw! friends always forget you! Why, where was M. de Breulh-Faverlay?"
    
    
      "It is the racing season, and he is a fixture in his stables."
    
    
      "Madame de Bois Arden?"
    
    
      "The new fashions are sufficient for her giddy head."
    
    
      "M. Gandelu?"
    
    
      "He has his son's affairs to look after and there is no one else of any
      consequence."
    
    
      "And how about young Gandelu?"
    
    
      "Oh! he has yielded to Tantaine's winning power, and has made it up with
      Rose, and the turtle doves have taken wing for Florence."
    
    
      But the doctor was still dissatisfied. "I am uneasy about the Mussidans,"
      said he.
    
    
      "And pray why? De Croisenois has been very well received. I don't say that
      Mademoiselle Sabine has exactly jumped into his arms, but she thanks him
      every evening for the flowers he sends in the morning, and you can't
      expect more than that."
    
    
      "I wish the Count had not put off the marriage. Why did he do so?"
    
    
      "It annoys me, too; but we can't have everything; set your mind at rest."
    
    
      By this time the banker had contrived to reassure the doctor.
    
    
      "Besides," he added, "everything is going on well, even our Tafila mines.
      I have taxed our people, according to their means, from one to twenty
      thousand francs, and we are certain of a million."
    
    
      The doctor rubbed his hands, and a delicious prospect of enjoyments
      stretched out before him.
    
    
      "I have seen Catenac," continued Martin Rigal. "He has returned from
      Vendome, and the Duke de Champdoce is wild with hope and expectation, and
      is on the path which he thinks will take him to his son."
    
    
      "And how about Perpignan?"
    
    
      Mascarin laughed.
    
    
      "Perpignan is just as much a dupe as the Duke is; he thinks absolutely
      that he has discovered all the clues that I myself placed on his road.
      Before, however, they have quite concluded their investigations, Paul will
      be my daughter's husband and Flavia the future Duchess of Champdoce, with
      an income that a monarch might envy."
    
    
      He paused, for there was a light tap on the door, and Flavia entered. She
      bowed to the doctor, and, with the graceful movement of a bird, perched
      herself upon her father's knee, and, throwing her arms round his neck,
      kissed him again and again.
    
    
      "This is a very nice little preface," said the banker with a forced smile.
      "The favor is granted in advance, for, of course, this means that you have
      come to ask one."
    
    
      The girl shook her head, and returned in the tone of one addressing a
      naughty child,       
    
    
      "Oh, you bad papa! Am I in the habit of selling my kisses? I am sure that
      I have only to ask and to have."
    
    
      "Of course not, only              "
    
    
      "I came to tell you that dinner was ready, and that Paul and I are both
      very hungry; and I only kissed you because I loved you; and if I had to
      choose a father again, out of the whole it would be you."
    
    
      He smiled fondly.
    
    
      "But for the last six weeks," said he, "you have not loved me so well."
    
    
      "No," returned she with charming simplicity, "not for so long       nearly
      for fifteen days perhaps."
    
    
      "And yet it is more than a month since the good doctor brought a certain
      young man to dinner."
    
    
      Flavia uttered a frank, girlish laugh.
    
    
      "I love you dearly," said she, "but especially for one thing."
    
    
      "And what is that, pray?"
    
    
      "Ah! that is the secret; but I will tell it you for all that. It is only
      within the last fortnight that I have found out how really good you have
      been, and how much trouble you took in bringing Paul to me; but to think
      that you should have to put on those ugly old clothes, that nasty beard
      and those spectacles."
    
    
      At these words the banker started so abruptly to his feet that Flavia
      nearly fell to the ground.
    
    
      "What do you mean by this?" said he.
    
    
      "Do you suppose a daughter does not know her father? You might deceive
      others, but I       "
    
    
      "Flavia, I do not comprehend your meaning."
    
    
      "Do you mean to tell me," asked she, "that you did not come to Paul's
      rooms the day I was there?"
    
    
      "Are you crazy? Listen to me."
    
    
      "No, I will not; you must not tell me fibs. I am not a fool; and when you
      went out with the doctor, I listened at the door, and I heard a few words
      you said; and that isn't all, for when I got here, I hid myself and I saw
      you come into this room."
    
    
      "But you said nothing to any one, Flavia?"
    
    
      "No, certainly not."
    
    
      Rigal breathed a sigh of relief.
    
    
      "Of course I do not count Paul," continued the girl, "for he is the same
      as myself."
    
    
      "Unhappy child!" exclaimed the banker in so furious a voice, and with such
      a threatening gesture of the hand, that for the first time in her life
      Flavia was afraid of her father.
    
    
      "What have I done?" asked she, the tears springing to her eyes. "I only
      said to Paul that we should be terribly ungrateful if we did not worship
      him; for you don't know what he does for us. Why, he even dresses up in
      rags, and goes to see you."
    
    
      Hortebise, who up to this time had not said a word, now interfered.
    
    
      "And what did Paul say?" asked he.
    
    
      "Paul? Oh, nothing for a moment. Then he cried out, 'I see it all now,'
      and laughed as if he would have gone into a fit."
    
    
      "Did you not understand, my poor child, what this laugh means? Paul thinks
      that you have been my accomplice, and believes that it was in obedience to
      your orders that I went to look for him."
    
    
      "Well, and suppose he does?"
    
    
      "A man like Paul never loves a woman who has run after him; and no matter
      how great her beauty may be, will always consider that she has thrown
      herself in his path. He will accept all her devotion, and make no more
      return than a stone or a wooden idol would do. You cannot see this, and
      God grant that it may be long before the bandage is removed from your
      eyes. Can you not read the quality of this foolish boy, who has not a
      manly instinct in him?"
    
    
      "Enough!" she cried, "enough! I am not such a coward as to allow you to
      insult my husband."
    
    
      He shuddered at the thought that his words might cost him his daughter's
      love, but Hortebise interposed by putting his arm round Flavia's waist and
      leading her from the room. When he returned, he observed,       
    
    
      "I cannot understand your anger. It seems to me that all recrimination is
      most indiscreet, for you can at any moment break off this marriage."
    
    
      "Do you think it is nothing for me to be at the mercy of that cowardly
      wretch, Paul?"
    
    
      "Not more so than you are by the foolish weakness of your daughter. Is not
      Paul our accomplice? And are we any more compromised because he has
      discovered the secret of your triple personality?"
    
    
      "Ah! you have not a father's feelings. Up till now Paul did not know that
      I was Mascarin, and believed me to be the victim of blackmailers. As a
      dupe he respected me, as an accomplice he will scorn me. This disastrous
      marriage must be hastened."
    
    
      Paul and Flavia's marriage took place at the end of the next week, and
      Paul left his simple bachelor abode to take possession of the magnificent
      suite of rooms prepared for him by the banker in his house in the Rue
      Montmartre. The change was great, but Paul was no longer surprised at
      anything. He did not feel the faintest tinge of remorse; he only feared
      one thing, and that was that by some blunder he might compromise his
      future, when the eventful day arrived which would give him the social
      position and standing of heir to a dukedom.
    
    
      When, however, the Duke de Champdoce came, accompanied by Perpignan, the
      young imposter rose to the level of his masters, and played his part with
      most consummate skill. The Duke, whose life had been one long scene of
      misery, and who had so cruelly expiated the sins of his youth, seemed to
      have become suddenly lenient; and had Paul obeyed him, he would at once
      have established himself with his young wife at the Hotel de Champdoce,
      but Martin Rigal put a veto upon this, for he was not quite satisfied that
      his son-in-law was really the heir to the Champdoce dukedom; and finally
      it was agreed that the Duke should come to breakfast the next morning and
      take away Paul. Eleven was the hour fixed, but the Duke appeared at the
      banker's house at ten, where he, Catenac, Hortebise, and Paul were
      assembled together in solemn conclave.
    
    
      "Now, papa," said Flavia, who kept her father on thorns by her gay and
      frolicsome criticisms, "you will no longer blame me for falling in love
      with a poor Bohemian, for you see that he is a Champdoce, and that his
      father possesses millions."
    
    
      The Duke was now seated on the sofa, holding the hand of the young man
      whom he believed to be his son tightly in his. The Duchess, to whom he had
      given a hint of what was going on, had been taken seriously ill from
      over-excitement, but had recovered herself a little, and the Duke was
      describing this when he was suddenly interrupted by a series of full and
      heavy blows struck upon the other side of the wall of the room. A pickaxe
      was evidently at work. The whole house was shaken by the violence of the
      attack, and a screen, which stood near the spot, was thrown down.
    
    
      The plotters gazed upon each other with pale and terror-stricken faces,
      for it was evident that the fresh brick wall, the work of Mascarin and
      Beaumarchef, was being destroyed. The Duke sat in perfect amazement, for
      the alarm of his host and his friends was plainly evident. He could feel
      Paul's hand tremble in his, but could not understand why work evidently
      going on in the next house could cause such feelings of alarm. Flavia was
      the only one who had no suspicion, and she remarked, "Dear me! I should
      like to know the meaning of this disturbance."
    
    
      "I will send and inquire," said her father; but scarcely had he opened the
      door than he retreated with a wild expression of terror in his face, and
      his arms stretched out in front of him, as though to bar the approach of
      some terrible spectre. In the doorway stood an eminently
      respectable-looking gentleman, wearing a pair of gold-rimmed spectacles,
      and behind him a commissary of police, girt with his official scarf, while
      farther back still were half a dozen police officers.
    
    
      "M. Lecoq," cried the three confederates in one breath, while through
      their minds flashed the same terrible idea       "We are lost."
    
    
      The celebrated detective advanced slowly into the room, curiously watching
      the group collected there. There was an air of entire satisfaction visible
      on his countenance.
    
    
      "Aha!" he said, "I was right, it seems. I was sure that I was making no
      mistake in rapping at the other side of the wall. I knew that it would be
      heard in here."
    
    
      By this time, however, the banker had, to all outward appearance, regained
      his self-command.
    
    
      "What do you want here?" asked he insolently. "What is the meaning of this
      intrusion?"
    
    
      "This gentleman will explain," returned Lecoq, stepping aside to make way
      for the commissary of police to come forward. "But, to shorten matters, I
      may tell you that I have obtained a warrant for your arrest, Martin Rigal,
      alias Tantaine, alias Mascarin."
    
    
      "I don't understand you!"
    
    
      "Indeed. Do you think that Tantaine has cleaned his hands so completely
      that not a drop of Andre's blood clings to the fingers of Martin Rigal?"
    
    
      "On my word, you are speaking in riddles."
    
    
      A bland smile passed over Lecoq's face as, drawing a folded letter from
      his pocket, he answered,       
    
    
      "Perhaps you are acquainted with the handwriting of your daughter. Well,
      then, listen to what she wrote not so very long ago to the very Paul who
      is sitting on the sofa there.
    
    
      "'MY DEAREST PAUL,       
    
    
      "'We should be guilty of the deepest ingratitude if              '"
    
    
      "Enough! Enough!" cried the banker in a hoarse voice. "Lost, lost, lost!
      My own child has been my ruin!"
    
    
      The calmest of the conspirators was now the one who was generally the
      first to take alarm, and this was the genial Doctor Hortebise. When he
      recognized Lecoq, he had gently opened his locket and taken from it a
      small pellet of grayish-colored paste, and, holding it between his
      fingers, had waited until his leader should declare that all hope was
      gone.
    
    
      In the meantime Lecoq turned towards Catenac.
    
    
      "And you too are included in this warrant," said he.
    
    
      Catenac, perhaps owing to his legal training, made no reply to Lecoq, but
      addressing the commissary, observed,       
    
    
      "I am the victim of a most unpleasant mistake, but my position              "
    
    
      "The warrant is quite regular," returned the commissary. "You can see it
      if you desire."
    
    
      "No, it is not necessary. I will only ask you to conduct me to the
      magistrate who issued it, and in five minutes all will be explained."
    
    
      "Do you think so?" asked Lecoq in a quiet tone of sarcasm. "You have not
      heard, I can see, of what took place yesterday. A laborer, in the course
      of his work, discovers the remains of a newly-born infant, wrapped in a
      silk handkerchief and a shawl. The police soon set inquiries on foot, and
      have found the mother       a girl named Clarisse."
    
    
      Had not Lecoq suddenly grasped Catenac's arm, the lawyer would have flown
      at Martin Rigal's throat.
    
    
      "Villain, traitor!" panted he, "you have sold me!"
    
    
      "My papers have been stolen," faltered the banker.
    
    
      He now saw that the blows struck upon the other side of the wall were
      merely a trick, for Lecoq had thought that a little preliminary fright
      would render them more amenable to reason.
    
    
      Hortebise still looked on calmly; he knew that the game was lost.
    
    
      "I belong to a respectable family," thought he, "and I will not bring
      dishonor upon it. I have no time to lose."
    
    
      As he spoke he placed the contents of the locket between his lips and
      swallowed them.
    
    
      "Ah," murmured he, as he did so, "with my constitution and digestion, it
      is really hard to end thus."
    
    
      No one had noticed the doctor's movements, for Lecoq had moved the screen,
      and was showing the commissary a hole which had been made in the wall
      large enough for the body of a man to pass through. But a sudden sound cut
      these investigations short, for Hortebise had fallen to the ground, and
      was struggling in a series of terrible convulsions.
    
    
      "How stupid of me not to have foreseen this," exclaimed Lecoq. "He has
      poisoned himself; let some one run for a doctor. Take him into another
      room and lay him on a bed."
    
    
      While these orders were being carried out, Catenac was removed to a cab
      which was in waiting, and Martin Rigal seemed to have lapsed into a state
      of moody imbecility. Suddenly he started to his feet, crying,       
    
    
      "My daughter Flavia! yes, her name is Flavia, what is to become of her?
      She has no fortune, and she is married to a man who can never provide for
      her. My child will perhaps starve. Oh, horrible thought!"
    
    
      The man's strong mind had evidently given way, and his love for his child
      and the hideous future that lay before her had broken down the barrier
      that divides reason from insanity. He was secured by the officers, raving
      and struggling. When Lecoq was left alone with the Duke, Paul and Flavia,
      he cast a glimpse of pity at the young girl, who had crouched down in a
      corner, and evidently hardly understood the terrible scene that had just
      passed.
    
    
      "Your Grace," said he, turning to the Duke, "you have been the victim of a
      foul conspiracy; this young man is not your son; he is Paul Violaine, and
      is the son of a poor woman who kept a petty haberdashery shop in the
      provinces."
    
    
      The miserable young fool began to bluster, and attempted to deny this
      statement; but Lecoq opened the door, and Rose appeared in a most becoming
      costume. Paul now made no effort to continue his protestations, but
      throwing himself on his knees, in whining accents confessed the whole
      fraud and pleaded for mercy, promising to give evidence against his
      accomplices.
    
    
      "Do not despair, your Grace," said Lecoq, as he conducted the Duke to his
      carriage; "this certainly is not your son; but I have found him,
      and to-morrow, if you like, you shall be introduced to him."
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XXXV.
    
    
      "EVERY MAN TO HIS OWN PLACE."
    
    
      Obedient to the wishes of M. Lecoq, Andre resigned himself to a lengthy
      sojourn at the Hospital de Beaujon, and had even the courage to affect
      that state of profound indifference that had deceived Mascarin. The
      pretended sick man in the next bed to his told him all that had taken
      place, but the days seemed to be interminable, and he was beginning to
      lose patience, when one morning he received a letter which caused a gleam
      of joy to pass through his heart. "All is right," wrote Lecoq. "Danger is
      at an end. Ask the house surgeon for leave to quit the hospital. Dress
      yourself smartly. You will find me waiting at the doors.       L."
    
    
      Andre was not quite convalescent, for he might have to wear his arm in a
      sling for many weeks longer; but these considerations did not deter him.
      He now dressed himself in a suit which he had sent for to his rooms, and
      about nine o'clock he left the hospital.
    
    
      He stood upon the steps inhaling deep draughts of the fresh air, and then
      began to wonder where the strange personage was to whom he owed his life.
      While he was deliberating what to do, an open carriage drew up before the
      door of the hospital.
    
    
      "You have come at last," exclaimed Andre, rushing up to the gentleman who
      alighted from it. "I was getting quite anxious."
    
    
      "I am about five minutes late," returned Lecoq; "but I was detained," and
      then, as Andre began to pour out his thanks, he added, "Get into the
      carriage; I have a great deal to say to you."
    
    
      Andre obeyed, and as he did so, he detected something strange in the
      expression of his companion's face.
    
    
      "What!" remarked Lecoq, "do you see by my face that I have something to
      tell you? You are getting quite a keen observer. Well, I have, indeed, for
      I have passed the night going through Mascarin's papers, and I have just
      gone through a painful scene       I may say, one of the most painful that
      I have ever witnessed. The intellect of Mascarin," said he, "has given way
      under the tremendous pressure put upon it. The ruling passion of the
      villain's life was his love for his daughter. He imagines that Flavia and
      Paul are without a franc and in want of bread; he thinks that he
      continually hears his daughter crying to him for help. Then, on his knees,
      he entreats the warder to let him out, if only for a day, swearing that he
      will return as soon as he has succored his child. Then, when his prayer is
      refused, he bursts into a frenzied rage and tears at his door, howling
      like an infuriated animal; and this state may last to the end of his life,
      and every minute in it be a space of intolerable torture. Doctor Hortebise
      is dead; but the poison upon which he relied betrayed him, and he suffered
      agonies for twenty-four hours. Catenac will fight to the bitter end, but
      the proofs are against him, and he will be convicted of infanticide. In
      Rigal's papers I have found evidence against Perpignan, Verminet and Van
      Klopen, who will all certainly hear something about penal servitude.
      Nothing has been settled yet about Toto Chupin, for it must be remembered
      that he came and gave himself up."
    
    
      "And what about Croisenois?"
    
    
      "His Company will be treated like any other attempt to extort money by
      swindling, and the Marquis will be sent to prison for two months, and the
      money paid for shares returned to the dupes, and that, I think, is all
      that I have to tell you, except that by to-morrow M. Gandelu will receive
      back the bills to which his son affixed a forged signature. And now,"
      continued Lecoq, after a short pause, "the time has come for me to tell
      you why, at our first interview, I saluted you as the heir of the Duke de
      Champdoce. I had guessed your history, but it was only last night I heard
      all the details."
    
    
      Then the detective gave a brief but concise account of the manuscript that
      Paul had read aloud. He did not tell much, however, but passed lightly
      over the acts of the Duke de Champdoce and Madame de Mussidan, for he did
      not wish Andre to cease to respect either his father or the mother of
      Sabine. The story was just concluded as the carriage drew up at the corner
      of the Rue de Matignon.
    
    
      "Get down here," said Lecoq, "and mind and don't hurt your arm."
    
    
      Andre obeyed mechanically.
    
    
      "And now," went on Lecoq, "listen to me. The Count and Countess de
      Mussidan expect you to breakfast and here is the note they handed to me
      for you. Come back to your studio by four o'clock, and I will then
      introduce you to your father; but till then, remember, absolute silence."
    
    
      Andre was completely bewildered with his unexpected happiness. He walked
      instinctively to the Hotel de Mussidan and rang the bell. The intense
      civility of the footmen removed any misgivings that he might have left,
      and, as he entered the dining-room, he darted back, for face to face with
      him was the portrait of Sabine which he had himself painted. At that
      moment the Count came forward to meet him with extended hands.
    
    
      "Diana," said he to his wife, "this is our daughter's future husband." He
      then took Sabine's hand, which he laid in Andre's.
    
    
      The young artist hardly dared raise his eyes to Sabine's face; when he did
      so, his heart grew very sad, for the poor girl was but a shadow of her
      former self.
    
    
      "You have suffered terribly," said he tenderly.
    
    
      "Yes," answered she, "and I should have died had it lasted much longer."
    
    
      Andre had the greatest difficulty in refraining from telling his secret to
      his beloved, and it was with even more difficulty that he tore himself
      away at half-past three.
    
    
      He had not been five minutes in his studio when there was a knock at the
      door, and Lecoq entered, followed by an elderly gentleman of aristocratic
      and haughty appearance. It was the Duke of Champdoce.
    
    
      "This gentleman," said the Duke, with a gesture of his hand towards Lecoq,
      "will have told you that certain circumstances rendered it expedient,
      according to my ideas, that I should not acknowledge you as my heir, but
      my son. The fault that I then committed has been cruelly expiated. I am
      not forty-eight; look at me."
    
    
      The Duke looked at least sixty.
    
    
      "My sins," continued the Duke, "still pursue me. To-day, in spite of all
      my desires, I cannot claim you as my legitimate son, for the law only
      permits me to give you my name and fortune by exercising the right of
      adoption."
    
    
      Andre made no reply, and the Duke went on with evident hesitation,       
    
    
      "You can certainly institute proceedings against me for the recovery of
      your rights, but       "
    
    
      "Ah!" interrupted the young man, "really, what sort of person do you think
      I am? Do you believe me capable of dishonoring your name before I assumed
      it?"
    
    
      The Duke drew a deep breath of relief. Andre's manner had checked and
      restrained him, for it was frigid and glacial to a degree. What a
      difference there was between the haughty mien of Andre and the gushing
      effusiveness of Paul!
    
    
      "Will you permit me," asked Andre, "to address a few words to you?"
    
    
      "A few words?"
    
    
      "Yes. I do not like to use the word 'conditions,' but I think that you
      will understand what I mean. My daily toil for bread gave me neither the
      means nor the leisure which I required to cultivate my art, for that is a
      profession that I could never give up."
    
    
      "You will be certainly your own master."
    
    
      Andre paused, as if to reflect.
    
    
      "This is not all I had to say," he continued at last. "I love and am loved
      by a pure and beautiful girl; our marriage is arranged, and I think       "
    
    
      "I think," broke in the Duke, "that you could not love any one who was not
      a fit bride for a member of our family."
    
    
      "But I did not belong to this family yesterday. Be at ease, however, for
      she is worthy of a Champdoce. I am engaged to Sabine de Mussidan."
    
    
      A deadly paleness overspread the Duke's face as he heard this name.
    
    
      "Never," said he. "Never; I would rather see you dead at my feet."
    
    
      "And I would gladly suffer ten thousand deaths than give her up."
    
    
      "Suppose I refuse my consent? Suppose that I forbid              "
    
    
      "You have no claim to exercise paternal authority over me; this can only
      be purchased by years of tender care. Duke de Champdoce, I owe you
      nothing. Leave me to myself, as you have hitherto done, and all will be
      simplified."
    
    
      The Duke reflected. Must he give up his son, who had been restored to him
      by such a series of almost miraculous chances, or must he see him married
      to Diana's daughter? Either alternative appeared to him to be equally
      disagreeable.
    
    
      "I will not yield on the point," said he. "Besides, the Countess would
      never give her consent. She hates me as much as I hate her."
    
    
      M. Lecoq, who had up to this moment looked on in silence, now thought it
      time to interpose.
    
    
      "I think," remarked he blandly, "that I shall have no difficulty in
      obtaining the consent of Madame de Mussidan."
    
    
      The Duke, at these words, threw open his arms.
    
    
      "Come, my son!" said he. "All shall be as you desire."
    
    
      That night, Marie, Duchess de Champdoce, experienced happiness for the
      first time in the affection and caresses of a son who had been so long
      lost to her, and seemed to throw off the heavy burden that had so heavily
      pressed her down beneath its own weight.
    
    
      When Madame de Mussidan heard that Andre was Norbert's son, she declared
      that nothing could induce her to give her consent to his marriage with her
      daughter; but among Mascarin's papers Lecoq had discovered the packet
      containing the compromising correspondence between the Duke de Champdoce
      and herself. The detective handed this over to her, and, in her gratitude,
      she promised to give up all further opposition to the match.
    
    
      Lecoq always denied that this act came under the head of blackmailing.
    
    
      Andre and Sabine took up their residence after marriage at the Chateau de
      Mussidan, which had been magnificently restored and decorated. They seldom
      leave it, for they love it for its vicinity to the leafy groves, in which
      they first learned that they had given their hearts to each other. And
      Andre frequently points out the unfinished work on the balcony, which was
      the occasion of his first visit to the Chateau de Mussidan. He says that
      he will complete it as soon as he has time, but it is doubtful whether he
      will ever find leisure to do this for a long time, for before the new year
      comes there is every chance of there being a baptism at the little chapel
      at Bevron.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you

     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
