GENERAL PREFACE

The story of New France is also, in part, the
story of much of New England, and of States whose
shores are washed by the Great Lakes and the Mississippi
River. It may truly be said that the history
of every one of our northern tier of commonwealths,
from Maine to Minnesota, has its roots in the French
r√©gime. It is not true, as Bancroft avers, that the
Jesuit was ever the pioneer of New France; we now
know that in this land, as elsewhere in all ages, the
trader nearly always preceded the priest. But the
trader was not often a letter-writer or a diarist:
hence, we owe our intimate knowledge of New
France, particularly in the seventeenth century,
chiefly to the wandering missionaries of the Society
of Jesus. Coming early to the shores of Nova
Scotia (1611), nearly a decade before the landing of
the Plymouth Pilgrims, and eventually spreading
throughout the broad expanse of New France, ever
close upon the track of the adventurous coureur de
bois, they met the American savage before contact
with civilization had seriously affected him. With
heroic fortitude, often with marvellous enterprise,
they pierced our wilderness while still there were
but Indian trails to connect far-distant villages of
semi-naked aborigines. They saw North America
and the North Americans practically in the primitiveviii
stage. Cultivated men, for the most part,&mdash;trained
to see as well as to think, and carefully to make
record of their experiences,&mdash;they left the most luxurious
country in Europe to seek shelter in the foul
and unwelcome huts of one of the most wretched
races of man. To win these crude beings to the
Christian Faith, it was necessary to know them intimately,
in their daily walks. No coureur de bois was
more expert in forest lore than were the Jesuit
Fathers; and the records made by these soldiers of the
Cross,&mdash;explicit and detailed, while familiar in tone,&mdash;are
of the highest scientific value, often of considerable
literary interest. The body of contemporary,
documentary material which, in their Relations and
Letters, the Jesuits of New France have bequeathed
to the historian, the geographer, and the ethnologist,
entitles them to the enduring gratitude of American
scholars. For forty years, these documents have, in
part, been more or less familiar to Americanists as a
rich storehouse of material. But, hitherto, they have
existed only in rare and costly forms, when in print
at all,&mdash;as original products of ancient French,
Italian, and German presses, or as reprints issued in
sparse number for small circles of bibliophiles;
while many important papers, capable of throwing
light upon certain portions of Canadian history hitherto
in shade, have as yet remained in manuscript.

We cannot promise for this series the entire body
of existing Jesuit documents, either printed or in
manuscript, which illustrate the history of New
France in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.
This would carry us, even were they all obtainable,
far beyond the necessary limits of this series; for the
fathers were profuse writers, and their papers are inix
many archives. It is of necessity a matter of selection.
We shall, however, reissue all of the documents
usually designated as Relations,&mdash;the Cramoisys,
the Quebec reissue, the Shea and O'Callaghan
reprints; and to these will be added a very considerable
collection of miscellaneous papers of importance,
from printed sources and from manuscripts, in order
to fill the chronological gaps and round out and complete
the story. It is the purpose of the Editor
to present this mass of selected material in chronological
order, so far as proves practicable, and to
furnish such scholarly helps as will tend to render it
more available than hitherto for daily use by students
of American history. To this end will be given an
English translation, side by side with the original
text. While translations of many of the briefest
documents, and of portions of others, have already
appeared in one form of other, this is the first
attempt to translate the entire body of the Relations.
In many cases, where corruptions in text have crept
in, we shall be enabled, by recourse to original
manuscripts, to restore correct renderings; this care
has been taken, wherever practicable, even to the examination
of manuscripts in European archives; but
occasionally we shall be obliged to follow our predecessors
blindly in this regard, either from inability
to discover the whereabouts of the original, or to
obtain access to it, when found. In the case of each
document, we shall invariably state the source
whence we obtained our copy, and shall give additional
bibliographical data as to other editions known
to us. All maps and other illustrations appearing
in previous editions will be reproduced in this; and
these will be supplemented by other important contemporaryx
aids of like character. At the end of each
volume will appear such Notes as seem necessary to
the elucidation of the text. The closing volume of
the series will contain&mdash;and probably will be wholly
devoted to&mdash;an exhaustive analytical Index, a feature
without which the work would lose much of
its value. In short, no pains have been, or will be,
spared to render all possible service to scholars, in
the present work. But the field is wide, the difficulties
are many, and the Editor makes no claims to
perfection. He will be grateful to any who, in the
course of publication,&mdash;promising to extend through
several years yet to come,&mdash;will offer helpful suggestions
in any department of the undertaking.

While seeking to reproduce the old texts as closely
as practicable, with their legitimate typographic and
orthographic peculiarities, it has been found advisable
here and there to make a few minor changes.
The original printer was sometimes careless,&mdash;Cramoisy
especially so,&mdash;and his proof-reader negligent.
The result was that certain typographical errors
crept into the original prints,&mdash;errors not of the
author's making, and therefore not illustrative of
his methods. These consist in the main, of: (1)
turned letters; (2) transposed letters; (3) slipped letters;
and (4) mis-spacings. To these obvious errors
may be added such as, e.g., mistaking the verb gratter
for grauer, evidently through a failure on the part
of the writer to cross his t's,&mdash;the context plainly
showing what was written; the printing, e.g., of
beau&#263;oup for beaucoup; or the repetition on the next
line of a syllable in a divided word, resulting in such
a redundancy as, poupouuant for pouuant. Palpable
blemishes like these, we have deemed it advisable toxi
correct without specific mention; in some instances,
however, the original error has been retained, and
in juxtaposition the correct rendering given within
brackets.

Another and more annoying class of errors is, the
wrong numbering of chapters and pages in the old
issues, chiefly the fruit of carelessness in make-up.
We indicate, throughout, the original pagination, by
inclosing within brackets the number of each page
at its beginning, e.g. [148]; in case of misnumbering,
the correct figure is also given, e.g. [150, i.e. 149].
A similar device is adopted as to chapter misnumbering,
e.g. Chapitre XXX. [i.e. XXIX.].

A difference in the typographic style of the documents
presented in the present series, will occasionally
be noticed. In following originals of the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries, we have of course
reproduced their peculiarities, such as the long "s,"
and character diphthongs; but where our sole copy
has been a modern reprint, in a modern typographic
dress, we have followed its style, deeming it inadvisable,
for mere sake of uniformity, to masquerade
the document in olden guise.

In the progress of the work, which has now been
under way for some sixteen months, many persons
beside the present staff have tendered helping
hands. To them, the Editor returns, for the Publishers
and for himself, grateful acknowledgment.
It is impracticable to name them all in this place;
but of a few from whom special favors have been
received, it is only just to speak: The Reverend
Arthur E. Jones, S. J., archivist of St. Mary's College,
Montreal, from the first opened his heart to
this enterprise, and has not only given us cartexii
blanche to ransack his priceless stores, but has contributed
invaluable suggestions and data, almost
without number. To Wilberforce Eames, librarian
of Lenox Library, and his assistant, Victor H.
Paltsits, we owe much; for in their institution the
greater part of the transcription is being done, and
their daily courtesies and kindnesses materially
lighten the task. Superintendent Robbins Little,
and Librarian Frederick Saunders, of Astor Library,
have also been of much assistance in the conduct of
the work. To John Nicholas Brown, of Providence,
R. I., and to his librarian, George Parker Winship,
we are indebted for numerous courtesies and suggestions
during the copying and photographing of
documents in the John Carter Brown Library of
Americana. Similar aid is being rendered by Dr.
Justin Winsor, of Harvard College Library, and his
assistants, W. H. Tillinghast and T. J. Kiernan; by
the librarians of St. Francis Xavier College, New
York, and the Jesuit Colleges at Georgetown, D. C.,
and Woodstock, Md.; by L. P. Sylvani, assistant librarian
of the Library of Parliament, Ottawa; and by
C. H. Gould, librarian of McGill University Library,
Montreal, and his assistant, Henry Mott. Donald
Guthrie McNab, of Montreal, has kindly permitted us
to photograph and reproduce his excellent oil portraits
of the early fathers; and, in this connection, we feel
under especial obligations to Messrs. Notman &amp; Son,
of Montreal, for their intelligent advice and patience
in photographing paintings and manuscripts for the
series. Marked privileges have been granted by the
officials of the Biblioth√®que Nationale and the Biblioth√®que
de l'Arsenal, of Paris. Numerous antiquarians
have rendered generous aid, notably Peter A.xiii
Porter, of Niagara Falls, N. Y.; W. M. Beauchamp,
of Baldwinsville, N. Y.; l'Abb√© H. A. B. Verreau,
of Montreal; Mgr. T. E. Hamel, of Quebec; and A. F.
Hunter, of Barrie, Ontario. Further acknowledgment
of assistance will be rendered in the several
volumes, as they appear.

INTRODUCTION

BY REUBEN GOLD THWAITES

Doubtless Norse vikings, venturing far southward
from outlying colonies in Iceland and Greenland,
first coasted New France, and beached their sturdy
ships on the shores of New England. But five centuries
passed without result, and we cannot properly
call them pioneers of American civilization. Columbus
it was, who unlocked the eastern door of the
New World. Five years later, John Cabot, in behalf
of England, was sighting the gloomy headlands
of Cape Breton. Cortereal appeared in the neighborhood,
in 1501, seeking lands for the Portuguese
crown. About this time, at intervals, there came to
Newfoundland certain Norman, Breton, and Basque
fishers, who, erecting little huts and drying-scaffolds
along the rocky shore, sowed the first seed of that
polyglot settlement of French, Portuguese, Spanish,
and English which has come down to our day almost
uninterruptedly. By 1511, these fishermen
appear to have known the mainland to the west;
for on the map of Sylvanus, in his edition of Ptolemy,
that year, we find a delineation of the "Square
Gulf," which answers to the Gulf of St. Lawrence.
In 1520, Fagundus visited these waters for the Portuguese,2
and four years later Verrazano was making
for the French an exploration of the coast between
North Carolina and Newfoundland. Whether or not
Cartier (1535) was the first to sail up the St. Lawrence
"until land could be seen on either side," no man can
now tell; apparently, he was the first to leave a record
of doing so. Progress up the river was checked by
Lachine Rapids, and he spent the winter on Montreal
Island.

France and Spain were just then engaged in one
of their periodical quarrels, and adventurers were
needed to fight battles at home, so that it was six
years before any attempts were made to colonize the
river-lands to which Cartier had led the way. In
1541, a Picard seigneur named Roberval, enjoying
the friendship of Francis I., was commissioned as
viceroy of the new country beyond the Atlantic, with
Cartier as his chief pilot and captain-general, and a
choice selection of jail-birds for colonists. Cartier
started off before his chief, built a fort at Quebec,
and, after a long and miserable winter, picked up a
quantity of glittering stones which he took to be
gold and diamonds, and gladly set sail for home.
Tradition has it that Roberval met him near the
mouth of the river, but was unable to induce him to
return to his cheerless task of founding a state in an
inhospitable wilderness, with convicts for citizens.
Roberval, however, proceeded to Quebec with his
consignment of prison dregs, and throughout another
protracted winter the flag of France floated from the
little intrenched camp which Cartier had planted on
the summit of the cliff. Roberval's principal occupation
appears to have been the disciplining of his
unruly followers, a work in which the gibbet and
3the lash were freely employed. He also essayed explorations
up the river; but the rude task was not to
his liking, and, with what remained of his battered
band, he followed Cartier to France.

It is commonly said that Canada was abandoned by
the French between the going of Roberval and the
coming of Champlain. But, though little was done
toward colonizing on the St. Lawrence, Newfoundland
was by no means neglected. Its fishing industry
grew apace. The rules of the Church, prescribing
a fish diet on certain holy days, led to a large
use of salted fish throughout Catholic Europe; and,
by 1578, full a hundred and fifty French vessels
alone, chiefly Breton, were employed in the Newfoundland
fisheries, while a good trade with the mainland
Indians, as far south as the Potomac, had now
sprung up. The island colony proved valuable as a
supply and repair station for traders and explorers,
and thus served as a nucleus of both French and
English settlement in America.

It is difficult for us of to-day to realize that, at any
time in the world's history, enlightened folk should
have thought good colonists could be made out of
the sweepings of the jails and gutters of the Old
World. But in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries
that delusion was quite generally entertained by
would-be founders of states across sea; it required
the lessons of more than a hundred years of disastrous
experiments to teach discerning men that only
the best of the middle class and the masses, can successfully
plant a new community in the wilderness.
The experiences of Cartier and Roberval on the St.
Lawrence, and of Laudonni√®re in Florida (1564),
were of no avail in influencing governmental policy
4at Paris. In 1590, the Marquis de la Roche was sent
out with the usual dissolute crew to succeed Roberval
as the king's agent on the banks of the St. Lawrence.
Leaving part of his ill-favored gang on the
desert Sable Isle, off Nova Scotia (where early in the
century Baron de L√©ry had vainly attempted to
plant a colony), La Roche set forth to explore the
mainland for a site. A wild storm blew his vessels
to France, and the wretched skin-clad survivors of
the band which he had left behind were not rescued
until thirteen years had elapsed. Their tale of horror
long rang in the ears of France.

In 1600-1603, Chauvin and Pontgrav√© made successful
trading voyages to the St. Lawrence. Samuel
de Champlain was one of the party which, in the
latter year, followed in Cartier's track to Montreal.
The same season, a Calvinist, named De Monts, was
given the vice-royalty and fur-trade monopoly of
Acadia, and in 1604 he landed a strangely-assorted
company of vagabonds and gentlemen on St. Croix
Island, near the present boundary between Maine
and New Brunswick; but in the spring following
they settled at Port Royal, near where is now Annapolis,
Nova Scotia, thus planting the first French
agricultural settlement in America. Five years later,
Champlain reared a permanent post on the rock of
Quebec, and New France was at last, after a century
of experiments, fairly under way.

Various motives influenced the men who sought
to establish French colonization in America. The
ill-fated agricultural colony of the Huguenots in
Florida (1562-68), was avowedly an attempt of Admiral
Coligny to found an enduring asylum for
French Protestants. The enterprise of New France,
5on the other hand, was the outgrowth of interests
more or less conflicting. Doubtless the court had
deepest at heart the kingly passion for territorial aggrandizement;
next uppermost, was the pious wish
to convert heathen nations to the Catholic faith, explorers
like Cartier being authorized to discover new
lands "in order the better to do what is pleasing to
God, our Creator and Redeemer, and what may be
for the increase of his holy and sacred name, and of
our holy mother, the Church;" the desire for pelf,
through the agency of the fur trade, and the possibility
of the discovery of precious metals, gave commercial
zest to the undertaking, and to many was
the raison d'√™tre of the colony; and lastly, was the almost
universal yearning for adventure, among a people
who in the seventeenth century were still imbued
with that chivalric temper which among Englishmen
is assigned to the Middle Ages. The inner
life of New France, throughout its century and a
half of existence, was largely a warring between
these several interests.

Missionaries came early upon the scene. With
the Calvinist De Monts were Huguenot ministers for
the benefit of the settlers, and Catholic priests to
open a mission among the savages, for the court had
stipulated with him that the latter were to be instructed
only in the faith of Rome. But no missionary
work was done, for the colony was through
several years on the verge of dissolution, and the
priests became victims of scurvy. Poutrincourt, who
held under De Monts the patent for Port Royal, did
nothing to further the purposes of the court in this
regard, until 1610, when, admonished for his neglect,
he brought out with him a secular priest, Messire
6Jess√© Fl√©ch√©, of Langres, who on June 24, "apparently
in some haste," baptized twenty-one Abenakis,
including the district sagamore, or chief. The account
of this affair, which Poutrincourt sent in triumph
to France, is the initial document in the present
series.

On the twelfth of June, 1611, there arrived at Port
Royal, at the instance of King Henry IV., two Jesuit
fathers, Pierre Biard and Ennemond Mass√©. They
were, however, not favorably received by Poutrincourt
and his followers; they found great practical
difficulties in acquiring the Indian languages and
made slight progress in the herculean task to which
they had been set. To them, came the following
year, a lay brother, Gilbert du Thet, who was soon
dispatched to the head of the order, in France, with
an account of the situation. In the spring of 1613,
he returned, in company with Father Quentin. The
little band of missionaries had no sooner established
themselves at the new French colony on Mt. Desert
Island, than the latter was attacked and dispersed by
the Virginian Argall. Du Thet was killed in the
fight, Mass√© was, with other colonists, set adrift in a
boat, and Biard and Quentin were taken to Virginia,
to be eventually shipped to England, and thence
allowed to return into France. Several of the earlier
documents of our series have to do with this first
and apparently unfruitful mission of the Jesuits to
Acadia.

In 1615, Champlain thought the time ripe for the
institution of Indian missions upon the St. Lawrence,
a spiritual field hitherto neglected, and introduced
to Quebec four members of the fraternity of
R√©collets, the most austere of the three orders of
7Franciscans; these were Fathers Denis Jamay, Jean
d'Olbeau, and Joseph le Caron, and a lay brother,
Pacifique du Plessis. To D'Olbeau was assigned
the conversion of the Montagnais of the Lower St.
Lawrence; Le Caron went to the Hurons, or Wyandots,
in the vast stretch of forested wilderness west
of the Ottawa River, and before the coming of autumn
had established a bark chapel in their midst;
Jamay and Du Plessis remained in the neighborhood
of Quebec, ministering to the colonists and the
wandering savages who came to the little settlement
for purposes of trade or sociability, or through fear
of scalp-hunting Iroquois. For ten years did these
gray friars practice the rites of the church in the
Canadian woods, all the way from the fishing and
trading outpost of Tadoussac to the western Lake of
the Nipissings. Barefooted, save for heavy wooden
sandals, coarsely clad in gown and hood, enduring
in a rigorous climate, to which they were unused, all
manner of hardships by flood and field, they were
earnestly devoted to their laborious calling in a time
when elsewhere the air of New France was noisy
with the strife of self-seeking traders and politicians.
Yet somehow their mission seemed without important
result. Even less successful was the enterprise
of some fellow R√©collets, who, in 1619, began
independent work among the French fishermen and Micmacs
of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Gasp√©,
but were forced in 1624, after many disasters, to
abandon their task, three of them joining the party at
Quebec.

The little band on the St. Lawrence, although thus
reinforced, felt impelled, in 1625, to invite the powerful
aid of the Jesuits, who in the face of great odds
8were just then holding most successful missions in
Asia, Africa, and South America. In response to
the call, three fathers of the black gown came to
Quebec this year,&mdash;Mass√©, who had been of the old
Acadian mission, Charles Lalemant, and that giant
among them, in both stature and deeds, Jean de
Br√©beuf. Immediately the work began to broaden,
but the records of the dual mission do not give
evidence of many converts,&mdash;a few Huron youth
taken to France, and there instructed and baptized,
being the chief gains. The wandering habits of
the Indians were not favorable to persistent instruction
of the young, and adults were unwilling to
commit themselves to the new doctrine, even when
not openly opposed to its promulgation. The summer
months were usually spent by the missionaries
at Tadoussac, Quebec, and Three Rivers, where
trading parties from the tribes were wont to assemble;
and, when the latter scattered for their winter
hunts, the missionaries accompanied them, sharing
the toils, dangers, and discomforts of the movable
camps, and often suffering much from positive abuse
at the hands of their not over-willing hosts.

The settlements of Port Royal and Quebec were at
this time wretched little hamlets of a few dozen huts
each, surrounded by a palisade, and these fell an easy
prey to small English naval forces (1628-29). With
their fall, ended the slender mission of the R√©collets
and Jesuits, who were in triumph carried off to England.
For a few months, France did not hold one foot
of ground in North America. But as peace had been
declared between France and England before this conquest,
the former received back all of its possessions,
and the inevitable struggle for the mastery of the
9continent was postponed for four generations longer.

With the release of Canada to France, in 1632, the
Jesuits were by the home authorities placed in sole
charge of the spiritual interests of both settlers and
Indians, and the history of their greatest missions begins
at this time. On the fifth of July, there landed
at Quebec, Fathers Paul le Jeune and Anne de Nou√´,
and a lay brother named Gilbert. Le Jeune was the
superior, and at once devoted himself to learning the
language and customs of the savages, and so studying
the enormous field before him as intelligently to
dispose of his meagre forces.

The Indians.

The existence of rival tribes among the Red
Indians of North America, was, perhaps, the most
formidable obstacle in the path of the missionaries.
It has always been impossible to make any hard-and-fast
classification; yet the Indians presented a considerable
variety of types, ranging from the Southern
Indians, some of whose tribes were in a relatively
high stage of material advancement and mental
calibre, down to the savage root-eaters of the Rocky
Mountain region. The migrations of some of the
Indian tribes were frequent, and they occupied overlapping
territories, so that it is impossible to fix the
tribal boundaries with any degree of exactness.
Again, the tribes were so merged by intermarriage,
by affiliation, by consolidation, by the fact that there
were numerous polyglot villages of renegades, by
similarities in manner, habits, and appearance, that
it is difficult even to separate the savages into
families. It is only on philological grounds that
these divisions can be made at all. In a general way
10we may say that between the Atlantic and the Rockies,
Hudson Bay and the Gulf of Mexico, there were
four Indian languages in vogue, with great varieties
of local dialect:

I. The Algonkins were the most numerous, holding
the greater portion of the country from the unoccupied
"debatable land" of Kentucky northward
to Hudson Bay, and from the Atlantic westward to
the Mississippi. Among their tribes were the Micmacs
of Acadia, the Penobscots of Maine, the Montagnais
of the St. Lawrence, the ill-defined tribes of
the country round about Lake St. John, and the
Ottawas, Chippewas, Mascoutens, Sacs, Foxes, Pottawattomies,
and Illinois of the Upper Lakes. These
savages were rude in life and manners, were intensely
warlike, depended for subsistence chiefly on
hunting and fishing, lived in rude wigwams covered
with bark, skins, or matted reeds, practised agriculture
in a crude fashion, and were less stable in
their habitations than the Southern Indians. They
have made a larger figure in our history than any
other family, because through their lands came the
heaviest and most aggressive movement of white
population, French or English. Estimates of early
Indian populations necessarily differ, in the absence
of accurate knowledge; but it is now believed that the
number was never so great as was at first estimated
by the Jesuit fathers and the earliest English colonists.
A careful modern estimate is, that the Algonkins
at no time numbered over 90,000 souls, and
possibly not over 50,000.

II. In the heart of this Algonkin land was planted
the ethnic group called the Iroquois, with its several
distinct branches, often at war with each other. The
11craftiest, most daring, and most intelligent of North
American Indians, yet still in the savage hunter state,
the Iroquois were the terror of every native band
east of the Mississippi, before the coming of the
whites, who in turn learned to dread their ferocious
power. The five principal tribes of this family&mdash;Mohawks,
Oneidas, Onondagas, Cayugas, and Senecas,
all stationed in palisaded villages south and east
of lakes Erie and Ontario&mdash;formed a loose confederacy
styled by themselves and the French "The Long
House," and by the English "The Five Nations,"
which firmly held the waterways connecting the
Hudson and Ohio rivers and the Great Lakes. The
population of the entire group was not over 17,000&mdash;a
remarkably small number, considering the active
part they played in American history, and the control
which they exercised through wide tracts of wilderness.
Related to, but generally at war with them,
were the Hurons of Canada, among whom the
Jesuits planted their earliest missions. Champlain,
in an endeavor to cultivate the friendship of his
Huron and Algonkin neighbors, early made war on
the Iroquois, and thus secured for New France a
heritage of savage enmity which contributed more
than any other one cause to cripple its energies and
render it at last an easy prey to the rival power of
the English colonies.

III. The Southern Indians occupied the country
between the Tennessee River and the Gulf, the Appalachian
Ranges and the Mississippi. Of a milder
disposition than their Northern cousins, the Cherokees,
Chickasaws, Choctaws, Creeks, and Seminoles
were rather in a barbarous than in a savage state;
by the time of the Revolution, they were not far behind
12the white proprietors in industrial or domestic
methods, and numbered not above 50,000 persons.
With them, this story of the Jesuit missions has little
to do; the Louisiana mission, an offshoot of that of
New France, did faithful work here, but the documentary
result was neither as interesting nor as prolific,
and necessarily occupies but small space in the
present series.

IV. The Dakotah, or Sioux, family occupied for
the most part the country beyond the Mississippi.
They were and are a fierce, high-strung people, genuine
nomads, and war appears to have been their chief
occupation. The Jesuits worked among them but in
slight measure, on the waters of the Upper Mississippi;
they met this family, chiefly in the persons
of the Winnebagoes, one of their outlying bands,
which at the time of the French occupation was resident
on and about Green Bay of Lake Michigan, at
peace and in confederacy with the Algonkins who
hedged them about.

The mission of the French Jesuits to these widely-scattered
hordes of savages forms one of the most
thrilling chapters in human history. It is impossible,
in this brief Introduction, to attempt anything
more than the barest outline of the theme; Rochemonteix,
Shea, and Parkman have told the story in
detail, from differing points of view, and with these
authorities the student of the following documents in
the case is presumed to be familiar. A rapid summary
of results will, however, be useful; and this we
may best obtain, at the expense of occasional repetition
of narrative, by following the fortunes of the
pioneers of the Cross through the several district
missions into which their work was naturally divided.

13
I. The Abenaki Mission.

This mission was chiefly in Maine and Acadia, and
on Cape Breton Island. The Abenakis (or Abnakis)
were a strong but mild-mannered Algonkin tribe,
settled in villages or cantonments; but, like others of
their race, in the habit of taking long semi-annual
journeys,&mdash;each winter to hunt, and each summer to
fish. We have seen that the French Jesuits, Biard
and Mass√©, were in the field as early as 1611, soon
after the establishment of Port Royal; their predecessor
being the secular French priest, Fl√©ch√©, who
had been introduced to the country by Poutrincourt,
the patentee. Biard and Mass√© met with many discouragements,
chiefly the opposition of Poutrincourt's
son, Biencourt (sometimes called Baron St. Just),
who had been left in charge of the colony. Nevertheless
the missionaries learned the native language,
and made many long journeys of exploration, one of
Biard's trips extending as far as the mouth of the
Kennebec. They were later joined by a lay brother,
Du Thet, and by Fathers Quentin and Lalemant.
Joining the new French colony on Mt. Desert Island,
in the spring of 1613, the establishment was almost
immediately destroyed by the Virginian Argall. In
the skirmish, Du Thet was killed.

In 1619, a party of R√©collets, from Aquitaine,
began a mission on St. John River, in Acadia, but
five years later, as we have seen above, abandoned
the task, the survivors joining the Quebec mission of
their order. Other R√©collets were in Acadia, however,
between 1630 and 1633, and later we have
evidence of a small band of Capuchins ministering
to French settlers on the Penobscot and Kennebec;
14but it is probable that they made no attempt to convert
the natives.

A Jesuit mission was founded on Cape Breton in
1634, by Father Julian Perrault; and a few years
later, Father Charles Turgis was at Miscou. Other
missionaries soon came to minister to the Micmacs,
but for many years their efforts were without result;
and sickness, resulting from the hardships of the
situation, caused most of the early black gowns to
retreat from the attempt. Finally, an enduring
mission was established among these people, and,
until about 1670, was conducted with some measure
of success by Fathers Andrew Richard, Martin de
Lyonne, and James Fremin. About 1673, the R√©collets
took up the now abandoned work, occasionally
aided by secular priests from the Seminary of Quebec,
and Jesuits, until at last the Micmacs from Gasp√©
to Nova Scotia were declared to be entirely converted
to the Catholic faith.

Father Gabriel Druillettes, of the Jesuit mission at
Sillery, near Quebec, went to the Kennebec country
in 1646, invited thither by converted Abenakis who
had been at Sillery, and during visits, extending
through a period of eleven years, was more than
ordinarily successful in the task of gaining Indian
converts to Christianity. In 1650, he made a notable
visit to the Puritans of Eastern Massachusetts, during
which was discussed the proposed union between
New France and New England, against the Iroquois.
Upon the final departure of Druillettes in 1657, the
Abenakis were but spasmodically served with missionaries;
occasionally a Jesuit appeared among
them, but the field could not be persistently worked,
owing to the demands upon the order from other
15quarters. The fathers now sought to draw Abenaki
converts to Sillery, and later to St. Francis de Sales,
at the falls of the Chaudi√®re, which soon became almost
exclusively an Abenaki mission.

In 1688, Father Bigot, of this mission, again entered
the field of the Kennebec, at the same time that
Rev. Peter Thury, a priest of the Quebec Seminary,
opened a mission on the Penobscot, and the R√©collet
F. Simon gathered a flock at Medoktek, near the
mouth of the St. John. They were in time aided
and succeeded by others: the Jesuits being Julian
Binneteau, Joseph Aubery, Peter de la Chasse,
Stephen Lauverjeat, Loyard, and Sebastian Rale;
the death of Rale, the greatest of them all, at the
hands of New England partisans in the border strife
of 1724, is a familiar incident in American history.
Jesuits succeeded to the Penobscot mission in 1703,
and with great zeal, but amid continual hardships
and discouragements, carried on the principal work
among the Abenakis until the downfall of New
France in 1763. The majority of the Kennebec converts,
however, emigrated to the mission of St. Francis
de Sales, and from there frequently went forth
upon avenging expeditions against the New England
borderers.

II. The Montagnais Mission.

This was centered at Tadoussac, and ministered to
the Montagnais, Bersiamites, Porcupines, Oumaniwek,
Papinachois, and other tribes of the Lower St. Lawrence
and the Saguenay. Tadoussac had, from the
earliest historic times, been a favorite harbor and
trading-station for the French; for, being at the
junction of two great rivers, it was convenient as a
16place of assembly for the natives of the lower country.
The first priests in the district had said mass
there; but it was not until 1640 that a Jesuit mission
was formed by Father Jean du Quen, its sphere of
influence soon reaching to the upper waters of the
Saguenay, Lake St. John, Hudson Bay, and the coast
of Labrador. Du Quen was actively assisted by
Charles Meiachkwat, a Montagnais convert, who
erected the first chapel, became a catechist, and made
extended tours through the neighboring tribes. In
time, there were associated with Du Quen, Fathers
Buteux and Druillettes. Protracted missionary tours
were made by them, with results which were considered
satisfactory as compared with other missions;
although they had serious difficulties to contend with,
in the prevalent intemperance which the fur trade introduced
among the natives, the belief in dreams,
the laxity of morals, and the wiles of medicine-men,
or sorcerers, as they were called by the Jesuits.

For the first few years, the missionaries spent
their winters in Quebec, ministering to the colonists,
and each spring went down to Tadoussac to meet the
summer trading parties; but greater persistency of
effort was deemed desirable, and thereafter, instead
of returning home in the autumn, they followed the
Indians upon their winter hunts, and in the course of
these wanderings endured the usual privations and
hardships of traveling camps. Bailloquet, Nouvel,
Beaulieu, Albanel, De Cr√©pieul, Dalmas, Boucher,
Peter Michael Laure, and Jean Baptiste Labrosse,
are other names of Jesuit fathers who at different
periods were engaged upon this toilsome mission.

In 1670, Tadoussac was almost deserted, owing to
Iroquois raids and the ravages of smallpox; the Montagnais
17and kindred tribes were in hiding, through
the vast country between Lake St. John and Hudson
Bay. They were still followed by their devoted
shepherds, whom no hardship could discourage. The
following year, Cr√©pieul began a mission on Hudson
Bay, and here in 1694 his auxiliary Dalmas was
killed. Laure (1720-37) left us a monument of his
labors in a Montagnais grammar and dictionary. Labrosse,
the last of his order at Tadoussac, instructed
many of his flock to read and write, and left a legacy
of native education, which has lasted unto the present
day; he lived and taught long after his order
had been suppressed in New France, and died at Tadoussac
in 1782.

III. The Quebec and Montreal Missions.

These included the several missions at Quebec,
Montreal, Three Rivers, Sillery, B√©cancourt, and St.
Francis de Sales, which were designed for the wandering
Montagnais of the district, those Algonkins of
the West who could be induced to come and settle on
the lower waters, and in later years such Abenakis of
Acadia and Maine as sought an asylum upon distinctively
French soil.

We have seen that R√©collets were first at Quebec,
ministering both to colonists and Indians, and that, in
1625, they invited the Jesuits to aid them. In 1629,
the joint mission came to a close through the surrender
of Quebec to the English. When the mission
was reopened in 1632, Jesuits alone were in charge,
their operations being at first confined to the neighboring
Montagnais, although they soon spread
throughout the entire Canadian field. In 1658,
Bishop Laval founded the Seminary of Quebec,
18whereupon the Jesuits resigned their parishes among
the colonists, and thereafter confined themselves to
their college and the Indian missions. In addition to
their parish work, the priests of the seminary conducted
missions in Acadia, Illinois, and on the lower
Mississippi.

The year following the return of the Jesuits to
Canada, Father Buteux, of that order, began his
labors at Three Rivers, which was a convenient gathering-place
for the fur trade. The village was frequently
raided by Iroquois, but remained until the
fall of New France one of the prominent centers of
missionary influence. The efforts of Buteux, which
lasted until his death at the hands of Iroquois in
1652, met with considerable success. His custom,
like that of the other missionaries, was to be present
at the French posts during the annual trading
"meets," and when the savages returned to the wilderness,
to accompany some selected band. In thus
following the nomadic tribes, he made some of the
longest and most toilsome journeys recorded in the
annals of the Society of Jesus, and shared with his
flock all the horrors of famine, pestilence, and inter-tribal
war.

It was soon realized by the missionaries that but
meagre results could be obtained until the Indians
were induced to lead a sedentary life. Their wandering
habit nullified all attempts at permanent instruction
to the young; it engendered improvidence and
laziness, bred famine and disease; and the constant
struggle to kill fur-bearing animals for their pelts
rapidly depleted the game, while the fur trade
wrought contamination in many forms. Missionary
efforts were at first conducive to the interests of the
19fur trade, by bringing far-distant tribes within the
sphere of French influence; but so soon as the Jesuit
sought to change the habits of the natives, to cause
them to become agriculturists instead of hunters,
and to oppose the rum traffic among them, then the
grasping commercial monopoly which controlled the
fortunes of New France, and was merely "working"
the colony for financial gains, saw in the Jesuit an
enemy, and often placed serious obstacles in his path.

In pursuance of the sedentary policy, and also to
protect the wretched Montagnais from Iroquois war-parties,
the Jesuits, in 1637, established for them a
palisaded mission four miles above Quebec, at first
giving it the name St. Joseph, but later that of Sillery,
in honor of Commander No√´l Brulart de Sillery,
of France, who had given ample funds for the founding
of this enterprise. Here were at first gathered
twenty of the Indians, who began cultivation of the
soil, varied by occasional hunting and fishing trips,
which the missionaries could not prevent. The little
town slowly grew in importance, both Algonkins and
Montagnais being represented in its population.
Three years later, nuns opened a hospital at Sillery,
for the reception of both French and Indian patients,
and thus greatly added to the popularity of
the mission. But in 1646 the nuns removed their
hospital to Quebec; a few years later, the church and
mission house were destroyed by fire; disease made
sad havoc in the settlement; the thin soil became exhausted
through careless tillage; Iroquois preyed
upon the converts, until at last the Algonkins almost
entirely disappeared; and although their place was
taken by Abenakis from Maine and Acadia, until the
attendance became almost solely Abenaki, the enterprise
20waned. In 1685, it was abandoned in favor of St.
Francis de Sales, a new mission established at the
falls of the Chaudi√®re River, not far from the St. Lawrence.
Beyond a monument of later days, to the memory
of Fathers Mass√© and De Nou√´, whose names are
prominently connected with this work, nothing now
remains to mark the site of the old Sillery mission.

From St. Francis, the mission work began to spread
into Maine. Of its character and extent there, mention
has already been made. St. Francis achieved a
certain measure of prosperity, as Indian missions go.
It became in time a source of serious trouble to the
New England borderers, for many a French and Indian
war-party was here fitted out against the latter,
during the series of bloody conflicts which marked
the three-quarters of a century previous to the fall
of New France. Finally, in September, 1759, Maj.
Robert Rogers descended upon the village with his
famous rangers, and in retaliation pillaged and
burned the houses, and killed "at least two hundred
Indians." New France soon after fell into the hands
of the English, and, the Jesuits being suppressed, we
hear little more of St. Francis de Sales.

In 1641, the missionary settlement of Montreal was
founded by Maisonneuve. The Jesuits were the
first resident clergy, and soon began mission work
among the neighboring Indians and those who resorted
thither from the valleys of the Lower St. Lawrence
and the Ottawa. Soon, however, the Sulpitians,
established in Paris by the Abb√© Olier, one of
the Society of Montreal, took charge of the mission
on Montreal Island, which in after years was moved
to the Sault au R√©collet, and thence to the Lake of
the Two Mountains, where there was gathered a polyglot
21village composed of Iroquois, Algonkins, and
Nipissings. Upon the opening of the English
r√©gime, the Jesuit and R√©collet missions were suppressed,
but those of the Sulpitians were undisturbed,
so that this mission at the lake is the oldest now extant
in Canada.

Among the Algonkins of the Ottawa River (or
Grande Rivi√®re), no permanent missions were attempted
by any of the orders. Long the chief highway to
the West, the river was familiar to travelling missionaries,
who frequently ministered to the tribesmen
along its banks, either at the native villages or during
the annual trading councils at the French posts of
Montreal, Three Rivers, and Quebec.

IV. The Huron Mission.

At the time of the advent of the French, the
Hurons (or Wyandots), allied in origin and language
to the Iroquois, numbered about 16,000 souls, and
dwelt in several large villages in a narrow district
on the high ground between Lake Simcoe and Georgian
Bay of Lake Huron. Their dwellings were
bark cabins, clustered within stoutly-palisaded walls,
and near each fortified town were fields of corn,
beans, pumpkins, and tobacco. Agricultural in habit,
keen traders, and in the main sedentary, these semi-naked
savages made short hunting and fishing expeditions,
and laid up stores for the winter. They were
better fighters than the Algonkins around them, yet
were obliged gradually to withdraw northward and
westward from Iroquois persecution, and during the
period of the Jesuit missions were almost annihilated
by the latter. To the southwest, across a wide stretch
of unpopulated forest, were the allies and kindred of
22the Hurons, the Tionontates, called also Petuns, or
Tobacco Nation, a term having its origin in their
custom of cultivating large fields of tobacco, which
commodity they used in a wide-spread barter with
other tribes. To the southeast of the Petuns, west
of Lake Ontario and on both sides of the gorge of
Niagara, were the peaceful Atiwandaronks, who, being
friends alike of Iroquois, Algonkins, and Hurons,
were known as the Neutral Nation. To the eastward
of the Neutrals, strongly intrenched in the interlocking
basins of the Genesee and the Mohawk,
lay the dread confederacy of the Iroquois, who in
time were to spread like a pestilence over the lands
of all their neighbors.

The intelligence and mobility of the Hurons rendered
the early prospects for missionary effort among
them more promising than with the rude and nomadic
Algonkins. But while at first the missionaries
of New France were well received, the innate savagery
of these people in time asserted itself. Their
medicine-men, as bitterly fanatical as the howling
dervishes of the Orient, plotted the destruction of
the messengers of the new faith; the introduction
of European diseases was attributed to the "black
gowns;" the ravages of the Iroquois were thought to
be brought on by the presence of the strangers; the
rites of the church were looked upon as infernal incantations,
and the lurid pictures of the Judgment,
which were displayed in the little forest chapels,
aroused unspeakable terror among this simple people;
finally, an irresistible wave of superstitious frenzy
led to the blotting out of the mission, accompanied
by some of the most heart-rending scenes in the
history of Christian evangelization.

23

It will be remembered that in 1615 the R√©collet
friar, Joseph le Caron, made his way into the far-away
country of the Hurons, but returned in the following
year, having learned much of their language and customs.
Five years later, another of his order, William
Poulin, took up the weary task, being joined in 1623 by
Fathers Le Caron and Nicholas Viel, and the historian
of the R√©collet missions, Brother Gabriel Sagard. All
of them soon left the field, however, save Viel, who
alone, amid almost incredible hardships, attained some
measure of success; but in 1625, when descending the
Ottawa to meet and arrange for co-operation with the
Jesuit Br√©beuf, at Three Rivers, he was willfully
drowned by his Indian guide in the last rapid of Des
Prairies River, just back of Montreal. Such is the
origin of the name of the dread Sault au R√©collet.

In 1626, the Jesuits Br√©beuf and Anne de Nou√´,
having received some linguistic instruction from R√©collets
who had been in the Huron field, proceeded
thither, with a R√©collet friar, Joseph de la Roche
Daillon, to resume the work which the R√©collets had
abandoned. Daillon attempted a mission to neighboring
Neutrals, but, being roughly handled by
them, rejoined his Jesuit friends among the Hurons.
Two years later, he returned to Quebec, having been
preceded by De Nou√´, who found it impossible to
master the difficult language of their dusky flock.
Br√©beuf, now left alone, labored gallantly among
these people, and, winning the hearts of many by
his easy adoption of their manners, gathered about
him a little colony of those favorably inclined to his
views. He was recalled to Quebec in 1629, arriving
there just in time to fall into the hands of Louis
Kirk, and be transported to England.

24

When Canada was restored to France, by the
treaty of St. Germain, the Jesuits were given sole
charge of the Indian missions, but it was 1634 before
the Huron mission could be reopened. In September,
Br√©beuf, Antoine Daniel, and Davost returned
to Br√©beuf's old field, and commenced, in the large
town of Ihonatiria, the greatest Jesuit mission in the
history of New France. Others soon joined them.
Additional missions were opened in neighboring
towns, some of the strongest of these being each
served by four fathers, who were assisted by laymen
donn√©s, or given men; while in the cultivation of
the soil, and the fashioning of implements and utensils
both for the fathers and for the Indians, numerous
hired laborers, from the French colonies on the St.
Lawrence, were employed in and about the missions.
Charles Garnier and Isaac Jogues, with their attendants,
made a tour of the Petun villages; other Jesuits
were sent among the Neutrals; and even the Algonkins
as far northwestward as Sault Ste. Marie were
visited (1641) by Raymbault and Jogues, and looked
and listened with awe at the celebration of the mass.
In 1639, there was built, on the River Wye, the fortified
mission house of St. Mary's, to serve as a center
for the wide-spread work, as a place for ecclesiastical
retreat for the fathers, and a refuge when enemies
pressed too closely upon them.

The story of the hardships and sufferings of the
devoted missionaries, as told us by Rochemonteix,
Shea, and Parkman, and with rare modesty recorded
in the documents to be contained in this series, is
one of the most thrilling in the annals of humanity.
Space forbids us here to dwell upon the theme. No
men have, in the zealous exercise of their faith,
25performed hardier deeds than these Jesuits of the
Huron mission; yet, after three years of unremitting
toil, they could (1640) count but a hundred converts
out of a population of 16,000, and these were for the
most part sick infants or aged persons, who had died
soon after baptism. The rugged braves scorned the
approaches of the fathers, and unmercifully tormented
their converts; the medicine-men waged continual
warfare on their work; smallpox and the Iroquois
were decimating the people.

Jogues was (1642) sent down to the colonies for
supplies for the missions, but with his Huron companions
was captured by an Iroquois war-party, who
led them to the Mohawk towns. There most of the
Hurons were killed, and Jogues and his donn√©, Ren√©
Goupil, were tortured and mutilated, and made to
serve as slaves to their savage jailers. Finally Goupil,
a promising young physician, was killed, and
Jogues, being rescued by the Dutch allies of the
Mohawks, was sent to Europe. Supplies thus failing
them, the Huron missionaries were in a sad
plight until finally (1644) relieved by an expedition
to the lower country undertaken at great hazards by
Br√©beuf, Garreau, and No√´l Chabanel. The same
season, Francis Joseph Bressani, attempting to reach
the Huron missions, had been captured and tortured
by Mohawks; like Jogues, he was rescued through
Dutch intercession and sent back to Europe, but both
of these zealots were soon back again facing the cruel
dangers of their chosen task.

A temporary peace followed, in 1645, and the hope
of the Jesuits was rekindled, for they now had five
missions in as many Huron towns, and another
established for Algonkins who were resident in the
26Huron district. But in July, 1648, the Iroquois attacked
Teanaustay√©, the chief Huron village, and
while encouraging the frenzied defense Father Daniel
lost his life at the hands of the enemy. He was
thus the first Jesuit martyr in the Huron mission,
and the second in New France,&mdash;for Jogues had been
tortured to death in the Iroquois towns, two years
before. The spirit of the Hurons was crushed in
this bloody foray; large bands, deserting their
towns, fled in terror to seek protection of the Petuns,
while others made their way to the Manitoulin
Islands of Lake Huron, and even as far west as the
islands of Green Bay and the matted pine forests of
Northern Wisconsin. Here and there a town was
left, however, and one of the largest of these, called
St. Ignatius by the Jesuits, was stormed by a thousand
Iroquois, March 16, 1649. The three survivors
fled through the woods to neighboring St. Louis,
where were Br√©beuf, now grown old in his service
of toil, and young Gabriel Lalemant. Bravely did
they aid in defending St. Louis, and administering
to wounded and dying; but at last were captured, and
being taken to the ruined town of St. Ignatius were
most cruelly tortured until relieved by death. Early
in November, Fathers Garnier and Chabanel met
their death in the Petun country, the former at the
hands of Iroquois, the latter being killed by a Huron
who imagined that the presence of the Jesuits had
brought curses upon his tribe.

The missions in the Huron country were now entirely
abandoned. A few of the surviving Jesuits
followed their flocks to the islands in Lake Huron;
but in June, 1650, the enterprise was forsaken, and
the missionaries, with a number of their converts,
27retired to a village, founded for them, on the Island
of Orleans, near Quebec. This settlement being in
time ravaged by the Iroquois, a final stand was made
at Lorette, also in the outskirts of Quebec, which
mission exists to this day.

The great Huron mission, which had been conducted
for thirty-five years, had employed twenty-nine
missionaries, of whom seven had lost their lives
in the work. This important field forsaken, many
of the missionaries had returned to Europe disheartened,
and apparently the future for Jesuit missions
in New France looked gloomy enough. The
Iroquois had now practically destroyed the Montagnais
between Quebec and the Saguenay, the Algonkins
of the Ottawa, and the Hurons, Petuns, and
Neutrals. The French colonies of Quebec, Three
Rivers, and Montreal, had suffered from repeated
raids of the New York confederates, and their forest
trade was now almost wholly destroyed. In this hour
of darkness, light suddenly broke upon New France.
The politic Iroquois, attacked on either side by the
Eries and the Susquehannas, and fearing that while
thus engaged their northern victims might revive
for combined vengeance, sent overtures of peace to
Quebec, and cordially invited to their cantonments
the once detested black gowns.

V. The Iroquois Mission.

Champlain had early made enemies of the Iroquois,
by attacking them as the allies of his Algonkin neighbors.
This enmity extended to all New France,
and lasted, with brief intervals of peace, for over
half a century. We have seen that Jogues was the
first of his order (1642) to enter the Iroquois country,
28as a prisoner of the Mohawks, the easternmost of the
five tribes of the confederacy. Two years later, Bressani,
while on his way to the Huron missions, was also
captured by the Mohawks, passed through a similar
experience of torture, was sold to the Dutch, and
transported back to France, and, again like Jogues
resumed his hazardous task of attempting to tame the
American savage. During the first peace (May,
1646), Jogues, now in civilian costume, paid a brief
visit to his former tormentors on the Mohawk, this
time conveying only expressions of good-will from
the governor of New France. His political errand
accomplished, he returned to Quebec; but in August
was back again, with a young French attendant
named Lalande, intent on opening admission among
the Iroquois. Meanwhile, there had been a revulsion
of sentiment on their part, and the two Frenchmen
had no sooner reached the Mohawk than they
were tortured and killed.

During an Iroquois attack upon Quebec, seven
years later (1653), Father Joseph Anthony Poncet
was taken prisoner by the marauders and carried to
the Mohawk, where he suffered in the same manner
as his predecessors; but his captors being now desirous
of a renewal of peace with the French, spared
his life, and sent him back to Quebec with overtures
for a renewal of negotiations. Early in July, 1654,
Father Simon le Moyne was sent forth upon a tour
of inspection, and returned to Quebec in September,
with glowing reports of the fervor of his reception
by both Mohawks and Onondagas. It was determined
to rear a mission among the latter, and thither
(1655),&mdash;a four weeks' voyage,&mdash;proceeded Claude
Dablon and Peter Mary Joseph Chaumonot; while,
29to appease the jealous Mohawks, Le Moyne at the
same time reopened a brief but unprosperous mission
among that tribe.

At first, Dablon and Chaumonot had high hopes of
their Onondaga enterprise; but mistrust soon arose
in the minds of the natives, and Dablon found it
necessary to proceed to Quebec and obtain fresh
evidences of the friendship of the French. He returned
in the early summer of 1656, accompanied by
Fathers Francis Le Mercier, superior of the Canadian
mission, and Ren√© M√©nard, two lay brothers, and a
party of French colonists under a militia captain,
who designed founding a settlement in the land of
the Iroquois. By the close of the year, the work
was in a promising stage; a number of Christianized
Hurons, who had been adopted into the confederacy,
formed a nucleus for proselyting, several Iroquois
converts had been made, and all five of the tribes
had been visited by the missionaries.

Fathers Paul Ragueneau and Joseph Imbert
Dup√©ron, who had been sent out from Quebec in
July, 1657, to assist the Onondaga mission, reached it
only after many perils en route; for meanwhile,
there had been a fresh Iroquois uprising against the
Hurons and Ottawas, in which Father Leonard Garreau
lost his life near Montreal, and the entire confederacy
was soon in an uproar against the white allies
of its ancient enemies. The intrepid Le Moyne
joined the party in November, and in the following
March (1658), on learning that all of the French had
been condemned to death, the entire colony stole
away in the night, and reached Montreal only after a
long and hazardous voyage. The great Iroquois mission,
which had promised so happily and cost so
30much in blood and treasure, was now thought to be
a thing of the past.

There was, however, still another chapter to the
story. In the summer of 1660, after two years of
bloody forays against New France, a Cayuga sachem,
who had been converted at Onondaga, came to Montreal
as a peace messenger, asking for another black
gown to minister to the native converts and a number
of French captives in the Iroquois towns. Once
more, Le Moyne cheerfully set out upon what seemed
a path to death; but he passed the winter without
molestation, and in the spring following was allowed
to return to Canada with the French prisoners.

It was five years later (1665), before the government
of New France felt itself sufficiently strong to
threaten chastisement of the raiding Iroquois, who
had long been making life a torment in the colonies
on the St. Lawrence. The Oneidas, Onondagas,
Cayugas, and Senecas sued for peace; but the Mohawks
were obstinate, and their villages were wasted
by fire until they too asked for mercy and the ministrations
of the Jesuits. Fathers James Fremin,
James Bruyas, and John Pierron were sent out in
1667; later, they were assisted by Julian Garnier,
Stephen de Carheil, Peter Milet, and Boniface, so
that by the close of 1668 a mission was in progress in
each of the five cantonments. A few notable converts
were made, among them Catharine Tegakouita,
known as the "Iroquois saint;" Catharine Ganneaktena,
an Erie captive who afterwards founded a
native mission village on the banks of the St. Lawrence;
the head-men Assendas√©, Kryn, and Soenrese.
But a great success was never possible; here as elsewhere,
the vices and superstitions of the tribesmen
31were deep-rooted, and they had not yet reached a
stage of culture where the spiritual doctrines of
Christianity appealed strongly, save to a few emotional
natures. The converts were subjected to so many
annoyances and dangers, that isolation was thought
essential, and there was established for them opposite
Montreal the palisaded mission of St. Francis Xavier;
this settlement, fostered by the French as a buffer
against Iroquois attack on the colonists, was subsequently
removed to Sault St. Louis, and is known in
our day as Caughnawaga. This mission, and that
of the Sulpitians on Montreal Mountain&mdash;later removed
to the neighboring Lake of the Two Mountains,&mdash;and
at Quint√© Bay, were frequently recruited
by Iroquois Christians, who were carefully instructed
by the missionaries in the arts of agriculture and the
rites of the church.

This depletion of the Iroquois population alarmed
the sachems of the confederacy. To please them,
Governor Dongan of New York, himself a Catholic,
introduced to the Five Nations three English Jesuits,
who sought in vain to counteract the movement.
The French did not abandon the Iroquois mission-field
until 1687, when the rising power of the English
obliged them to withdraw from the country. We have,
however, glimpses of occasional attempts thereafter to
revive the work, Bruyas being on the ground in 1701,
joined the following year by James de Lamberville,
Garnier, and Le Valliant, and later by James d'Hue
and Peter de Marieul. The entire party were again
driven from the cantonments in 1708, De Marieul being
the last of his order to remain on duty.

Thereafter, the Jesuits were chiefly devoted to
their mission at Caughnawaga, whither many Iroquois
32retreated before the inroads of Dutch and English
settlers who were now crowding upon their
lands. When the black gowns were at last expelled
from New France, secular priests continued their
work among the remnants of those New York Indians
who had sought protection by settling among the
French colonists on the St. Lawrence.

VI. The Ottawa Mission.

This embraced the tribes beyond Lake Huron,&mdash;the
Chippewas at Sault Ste. Marie, the Beavers, the Crees,
the Ottawas and refugee Hurons on Lake Superior,
the Menomonees, Pottawattomies, Sacs, Foxes, Winnebagoes,
Miamis, Illinois, and those of the Sioux who
lived on or near the banks of the Mississippi. The
Ottawas were the first Indians from the upper lakes
to trade with the French, hence that vast district became
early known as the country of the Ottawas.

The Huron mission was the door to the Ottawa
mission. Jogues and Raimbault were with the Chippewas
at Sault Ste. Marie in 1641; but it was nineteen
years after that (1660), before they were followed
by another Jesuit, the veteran Father M√©nard, who
accompanied an Ottawa fleet up the great river of
that name, through Lake Huron and the Sault, and
on to Keweenaw Bay, where he said the first mass
heard on the shores of the northern sea. After a
wretched winter on that inhospitable coast, spent in
a shanty of fir boughs, with savage neighbors who
reviled his presence, he proceeded inland intent on
ministering to some Hurons who had fled from Iroquois
persecution to the gloomy pine forest about the
upper waters of Black River, in what is now Wisconsin.
In August, 1661, he lost his life at a portage,
33thus being the first martyr upon the Ottawa mission.

Four years later, Claude Allo√ºez set out for Lake
Superior, and reaching Chequamegon Bay in October
(1665), built a little chapel of bark upon the southwest
shore of that rock-bound estuary,&mdash;the famous
mission of La Pointe. His flock was a medley,
Hurons and Algonkins here clustering in two villages,
where they lived on fish, safe at last from
the raging Iroquois, although much pestered by the
wild Sioux of the West. For thirty years did Allo√ºez
travel from tribe to tribe, through the forests
and over the prairies of the vast wilderness which a
century later came to be organized into the Northwest
Territory, and established missions at Green
Bay, Sault Ste. Marie, on the Miami, and, with Marquette,
among the Illinois at Kaskaskia.

Later, there arrived on the scene Fathers Louis
Nicholas, James Marquette, Dablon, Louis Andr√©,
Druillettes, Albanel, and others. The field of the
Northwest seemed at first, as did the Huron mission,
highly promising. The missionaries were everywhere
greeted by large audiences, and much curiosity
was displayed concerning the rites of the church;
but, as usual, the nomadic habits of the Indians rendered
instruction difficult. The fathers, with great
toil and misery, and subject to daily danger and insult,
followed their people about upon long hunting
and fishing expeditions; and even when the bands
had returned to the squalid villages, life there was
almost as comfortless as upon the trail. Among the
donn√©s and the Jesuit coadjutor brothers were skillful
workers in metal, who repaired the guns and utensils
of the natives, and taught them how best to obtain
and reduce the ore from lead and copper deposits.
34We have evidence that the copper region of Lake
Superior was at times resorted to by the lay followers
and their Indian attendants, to obtain material for
crucifixes and for the medals which the missionaries
gave to converts; and in the lead mines centering
about where are now Dubuque, Iowa, and Galena, Ill.,
the missionary attendants and Indians obtained lead
for barter with French fur-traders, who, like the soldiers
of the Cross, were by this time wandering all
over the Northwest.

Marquette had succeeded Allo√ºez at La Pointe, in
1669; but it was not long before the Hurons and
Ottawas of Chequamegon Bay foolishly incurred the
fresh hostility of the Sioux, and the following year
were driven eastward like autumn leaves before a
blast. Marquette established them in a new mission,
at Point St. Ignace, opposite Mackinaw; and it was
from here that, in 1673, he joined the party of Louis
Joliet, en route to the Mississippi River. The St.
Ignace mission became the largest and most successful
in the Northwest, there being encamped there,
during Marquette's time, about 500 Hurons and 1,300
Ottawas. The interesting story of Marquette, a familiar
chapter in American history, will be fully developed
in the documents of this series; and we shall be
able to present for the first time a facsimile of the
original MS. Journal of his final and fatal voyage
(1674), which is preserved among the many treasures
of the Jesuit College of St. Mary's, in Montreal.

After the suspension of the publication of the
Relations, in 1673, we obtain few glimpses of the Ottawa
mission, save in the occasional references of
travelers. The several local missions in the district
were, in the main, probably more successful than those
35in any of the other fields of endeavor. La Pointe,
Green Bay; St. Ignace (later Mackinac), Sault Ste.
Marie, St. Joseph's, and Kaskaskia became the most
important of them all; and at some of these points
Catholic missions are still maintained by Franciscan
friars and secular priests, for resident French Creoles
and Indians. The uprising of the Foxes against
French power, which lasted spasmodically from
about 1700 to 1755, greatly hampered the work of the
Jesuits; they did not, during this period, entirely absent
themselves from the broad country of the Ottawas,
but conversions were few and the records slight.

There was, for a time, governmental attempt to
supplant the Western Jesuits with R√©collets. Several
friars were with La Salle, who had a great antipathy
to the disciples of Loyola,&mdash;Father Hennepin's
adventures belong to this period of R√©collet effort,
his colleagues at Fort Cr√®vec&oelig;ur being Brothers
Ribourde and Membr√©; but their mission closed with
the Iroquois repulse of the French from Cr√®vec&oelig;ur,
and the consequent death of Ribourde. When La
Salle retired from the region, Allo√ºez resumed the
Illinois mission of the Jesuits; and soon after there
arrived upon the ground Fathers Gravier, Marest,
Mermet, and Pinet, who, because of the more docile
character of the tribes collectively known as the
Illinois,&mdash;Kaskaskias, Cahokias, Peorias, and Tamaroas,&mdash;found
here a relatively fruitful field. In
time, French settlements grew up around the
palisaded missions, intermarriages occurred, and the
work flourished for many years. Black gowns visited
the prosperous Illinois towns as late as 1781, when
the death of Father Meurin closed the work of his
order in the Northwest.

36
VII. The Louisiana Mission.

The Jesuit Marquette was in Louisiana in 1673,
but established no mission. Nine years later, Membr√©,
of the R√©collets, accompanied La Salle into the
region, and instructed natives as far down the Mississippi
as the mouth; and with La Salle at his death
were Anastasius Douay, of the R√©collets, and the
Sulpitian Cavalier. In 1698, Francis Jolliet de Montigny
and Anthony Davion, priests of the Seminary
of Quebec, established missions on the Yazoo, among
the Natchez, and elsewhere in the neighborhood; to
their aid, soon came others of their house,&mdash;St. C√¥me,
Gaulin, Fon√ßault, and Erborie, who labored until
about 1710, when, St. C√¥me and Fon√ßault being
killed by roving Indians, the survivors retired to the
North. The Jesuit Du Rue accompanied Iberville
into the country in 1699-1700, followed by De
Limoges and Dong√©, of his order, their work continuing
until about 1704.

In 1721, Father Charlevoix reported that but two
priests were then in Louisiana, one at Yazoo and
another in New Orleans; at the latter post, a chaplain
of some sort was established throughout the French
r√©gime. Capuchins and Jesuits were both admitted to
Louisiana, in 1722, the former to serve as priests to
the French of the country, chiefly at New Orleans
and Natchez, while the Jesuits were restricted to the
Indian missions, although permitted to maintain a
house in the outskirts of New Orleans. It was not
long before the Illinois mission became attached to
Louisiana, and missionaries for that field usually entered
upon their work by way of the New Orleans
house. Missions were maintained in the villages of
37the Arkansas, Yazoo, Choctaws, and Alibamons; but
the uprising of the Indians in the Natchez district,
in 1727, led to the fall of these several missions, together
with that of French colonies above New Orleans.
Father Du Poisson was killed by savages at
Natchez, where he was temporarily supplying the
French settlers in the absence of their Capuchin friar;
Souel fell a victim to the Yazoos, at whose hands
Doutreleau narrowly escaped destruction. However,
the Jesuits did not despair, but soon returned to the
Lower Mississippi, where they continued their labors
until about 1770, although the order had in 1762 been
suppressed in France.

The Louisiana mission of the Jesuits, while producing
several martyrs, and rich in striking examples
of missionary zeal, has yielded but meagre documentary
results; few of the papers in the present series
touch upon its work, and indeed detailed knowledge
thereof is not easily obtainable. Severed from Canada
by a long stretch of wilderness, communication
with the St. Lawrence basin was difficult and spasmodic,
and in the case of the Jesuits generally unnecessary;
for, having their own superior at New Orleans,
his allegiance was to the general of the order
in France, not to his fellow-superiors in Quebec and
Montreal. The several missions of New France played
a large part in American history; that of Louisiana,
although interesting, is of much less importance.

The Relations.

A few explorers like Champlain, Radisson, and Perrot
have left valuable narratives behind them, which
are of prime importance in the study of the beginnings
of French settlement in America; but it is to
38the Jesuits that we owe the great body of our information
concerning the frontiers of New France in the
seventeenth century. It was their duty annually to
transmit to their superior in Quebec, or Montreal, a
written journal of their doings; it was also their duty
to pay occasional visits to their superior, and to go
into retreat at the central house of the Canadian
mission. Annually, between 1632 and 1673, the
superior made up a narrative, or Relation, of the most
important events which had occurred in the several
missionary districts under his charge, sometimes
using the exact words of the missionaries, and sometimes
with considerable editorial skill summarizing
the individual journals in a general account, based in
part upon the oral reports of visiting fathers. This
annual Relation, which in bibliographies occasionally
bears the name of the superior, and at other times of
the missionary chiefly contributing to it, was forwarded
to the provincial of the order in France, and,
after careful scrutiny and re-editing, published by
him in a series of duodecimo volumes, known collectively
as The Jesuit Relations.

The authors of the journals which formed the basis
of the Relations were for the most part men of trained
intellect, acute observers, and practised in the art of
keeping records of their experiences. They had left
the most highly civilized country of their times, to
plunge at once into the heart of the American wilderness,
and attempt to win to the Christian faith the
fiercest savages known to history. To gain these
savages, it was first necessary to know them intimately,&mdash;their
speech, their habits, their manner of
thought, their strong points and their weak. These
first students of the North American Indian were
39not only amply fitted for their undertaking, but none
have since had better opportunity for its prosecution.
They were explorers, as well as priests. Bancroft
was inexact when he said, in oft-quoted phrase,
"Not a cape was turned, not a river entered, but a
Jesuit led the way." The actual pioneers of New
France were almost always coureurs de bois, in the
prosecution of the fur trade; but coureurs de bois, for
obvious reasons, seldom kept records, even when
capable of doing so, and as a rule we learn of their
previous appearance on the scene only through
chance allusions in the Relations. The Jesuits performed
a great service to mankind in publishing
their annals, which are, for historian, geographer,
and ethnologist, among our first and best authorities.

Many of the Relations were written in Indian
camps, amid a chaos of distractions. Insects innumerable
tormented the journalists, they were immersed
in scenes of squalor and degradation, overcome
by fatigue and lack of proper sustenance, often
suffering from wounds and disease, maltreated in a
hundred ways by hosts who, at times, might more
properly be called jailers; and not seldom had savage
superstition risen to such a height, that to be seen
making a memorandum was certain to arouse the
ferocious enmity of the band. It is not surprising
that the composition of these journals of the Jesuits
is sometimes crude; the wonder is, that they could
be written at all. Nearly always the style is simple
and direct. Never does the narrator descend to self-glorification,
or dwell unnecessarily upon the details
of his continual martyrdom; he never complains of
his lot; but sets forth his experience in phrases the
most matter-of-fact. His meaning is seldom obscure.
40We gain from his pages a vivid picture of life in the
primeval forest, as he lived it; we seem to see him
upon his long canoe journeys, squatted amidst his
dusky fellows, working his passage at the paddles,
and carrying cargoes upon the portage trail; we see
him the butt and scorn of the savage camp, sometimes
deserted in the heart of the wilderness, and
obliged to wait for another flotilla, or to make his
way alone as best he can. Arrived at last, at his
journey's end, we often find him vainly seeking for
shelter in the squalid huts of the natives, with every
man's hand against him, but his own heart open to
them all. We find him, even when at last domiciled
in some far-away village, working against hope to
save the unbaptized from eternal damnation; we
seem to see the rising storm of opposition, invoked
by native medicine-men,&mdash;who to his seventeenth-century
imagination seem devils indeed,&mdash;and at last
the bursting climax of superstitious frenzy which
sweeps him and his before it. Not only do these
devoted missionaries,&mdash;never, in any field, has been
witnessed greater personal heroism than theirs,&mdash;live
and breathe before us in the Relations; but we
have in them our first competent account of the Red
Indian, at a time when relatively uncontaminated by
contact with Europeans. We seem, in the Relations,
to know this crafty savage, to measure him intellectually
as well as physically, his inmost thoughts as
well as open speech. The fathers did not understand
him from an ethnological point of view, as
well as he is to-day understood; their minds were
tinctured with the scientific fallacies of their time.
But, with what is known to-day, the photographic reports
in the Relations help the student to an accurate
41picture of the untamed aborigine, and much that mystified
the fathers, is now, by aid of their careful journals,
easily susceptible of explanation. Few periods
of history are so well illuminated as the French
r√©gime in North America. This we owe in large
measure to the existence of the Jesuit Relations.

What are generally known as the Relations proper,
addressed to the superior and published in Paris,
under direction of the provincial, commence with Le
Jeune's Brieve Relation du Voyage de la Nouvelle-France
(1632); and thereafter a duodecimo volume, neatly
printed and bound in vellum, was issued annually
from the press of Sebastien Cramoisy, in Paris, until
1673, when the series was discontinued, probably
through the influence of Frontenac, to whom the
Jesuits were distasteful. The Relations at once became
popular in the court circles of France; their
regular appearance was always awaited with the
keenest interest, and assisted greatly in creating and
fostering the enthusiasm of pious philanthropists,
who for many years substantially maintained the missions
of New France. In addition to these forty
volumes, which to collectors are technically known as
"Cramoisys," many similar publications found their
way into the hands of the public, the greater part of
them bearing date after the suppression of the Cramoisy
series. Some were printed in Paris and Lyons
by independent publishers; others appeared in Latin
and Italian texts, at Rome, and other cities in Italy;
while in such journals as Mercure Fran√ßois and Annu√¶
Litter√¶ Societatis Jesu, occasionally were published letters
from the missionaries, of the same nature as the
Relations, but briefer and more intimate in tone.

It does not appear, however, that popular interest
42in these publications materially affected the secular
literature of the period; they were largely used in
Jesuit histories of New France, but by others were
practically ignored. General literary interest in the
Relations was only created about a half century ago,
when Dr. E. B. O'Callaghan, editor of the Documentary
History of New York, called attention to their
great value as storehouses of contemporary information.
Dr. John G. Shea, author of History of the
Catholic Missions among the Indian Tribes of the United
States, and Father Felix Martin, S. J., of Montreal,
soon came forward, with fresh studies of the Relations.
Collectors at once commenced searching for
Cramoisys, which were found to be exceedingly
scarce,&mdash;most of the originals having been literally
worn out in the hands of their devout seventeenth-century
readers; finally, the greatest collector of
them all, James Lenox, of New York, outstripped
his competitors and laid the foundation, in the Lenox
Library, of what is to-day probably the only complete
collection in America. In 1858, the Canadian government
reprinted the Cramoisys, with a few additions,
in three stout octavo volumes, carefully edited
by Abb√©s L√†verdi√®re, Plante, and Ferland. These,
too, are now rare, copies seldom being offered for sale.

The Quebec reprint was followed by two admirable
series brought out by Shea and O'Callaghan respectively.
Shea's Cramoisy Series (1857-1866), numbers
twenty-five little volumes, the edition of each of
which was limited to a hundred copies, now difficult
to obtain; it contains for the most part entirely
new matter, chiefly Relations prepared for publication
by the superiors, after 1672, and miscellaneously
printed; among the volumes, however, are a few
43reprints of particularly rare issues of the original
Cramoisy press. The O'Callaghan series, seven in
number (the edition limited to twenty-five copies),
contains different material from Shea's, but of the
same character. A further addition to the mass of
material was made by Father Martin, in Relations
In√©dites de la Nouvelle-France, 1672-79 (2 vols., Paris,
1861); and by Father Carayon in Premi√®re Mission des
J√©suites au Canada (Paris, 1864). In 1871, there was
published at Quebec, under the editorship of Abb√©s
Laverdi√®re and Casgrain, Le Journal des J√©suites, from
the original manuscript in the archives of the Seminary
of Quebec (now Laval University). The memoranda
contained in this volume,&mdash;a rarity, for the
greater part of the edition was accidentally destroyed
by fire,&mdash;were not intended for publication, being of
the character of private records, covering the operations
of the Jesuits in New France between 1645 and
1668. The Journal is, however, an indispensable complement
of the Relations. It was reprinted by a
Montreal publisher (J. M. Valois) in 1892, but even
this later edition is already exhausted. Many interesting
epistles are found in Lettres √âdifiantes et Curieuses,
√©crites des Missions √âtrang√®res, which cover the Jesuit
missions in many lands, between the years 1702 and
1776; only a small portion of this publication (there
are several editions, ranging from 1702-1776 to 1875-77)
is devoted to the North American missions.

American historians, from Shea and Parkman down,
have already made liberal use of the Relations, and
here and there antiquarians and historical societies
have published fragmentary translations. The great
body of the Relations and their allied documents, however,
has never been Englished. The text is difficult,
44for their French is not the French of the modern
schools; hence these interesting papers have been
doubly inaccessible to the majority of our historical
students. The present edition, while faithfully reproducing
the old French text, even in most of
its errors, offers to the public for the first time, an
English rendering side by side with the original.

In breadth of scope, also, this edition will, through
the generous enterprise of the publishers, readily be
first in the field. Not only will it embrace all of the
original Cramoisy series, the Shea and O'Callaghan
series, those collected by Fathers Martin and Carayon,
the Journal des J√©suites, and such of the Lettres √âdifiantes
as touch upon the North American missions,
but many other valuable documents which have
not previously been reprinted; it will contain, also,
considerable hitherto-unpublished material from the
manuscripts in the archives of St. Mary's College,
Montreal, and other depositories. These several
documents will be illustrated by faithful reproductions
of all the maps and other engravings appearing
in the old editions, besides much new material
obtained especially for this edition, a prominent
feature of which will be authentic portraits of many
of the early fathers, and photographic facsimiles of
pages from their manuscript letters.

In the Preface to each volume will be given such
Bibliographical Data concerning its contents, as seem
necessary to the scholar. The appended Notes consist
of historical, biographical, arch√¶ological, and miscellaneous
comment, which it is hoped may tend to
the elucidation of the text. An exhaustive General
Index to the English text will appear in the final
volume of the series.



PREFACE TO VOL. I

There is a dramatic unity in the Jesuit Relations
and Allied Documents, as they will be presented in
this series. Commencing with a report of the first
conversion of savages in New France, in 1610, by a
secular priest, and soon drifting into the records of
Jesuit missionary effort, they touch upon practically
every important enterprise of the Jesuits, in Canada
and Louisiana, from the coming of Fathers Biard
and Mass√©, in 1611, to the death, in the closing
decade of the eighteenth century, of Father Well,
"the last Jesuit of Montreal."

I. The series fitly opens with Lescarbot's La
Conversion des Savvages. Marc Lescarbot, a Paris
lawyer, a Huguenot poet as well as historian, and in
many respects a picturesque character in the early
scenes of our drama, adroitly seeks in this document
to convince the Catholic Queen of France that his
Huguenot patrons, De Monts and Poutrincourt, are
so wisely ordering affairs in their New World domain
that not only will the glory of France be enhanced,
but the natives be won to Christ through the medium
of the Church; for it was part of the agreement
entered into with the Crown, by these adventurers,
that while their colonists should be permitted to have
Huguenot ministers, the aborigines must be converted
only by Catholic priests. To this end, Lescarbot
46describes with unction the sudden conversion by
a secular priest, Messire Jess√© Fl√©ch√©, of old Chief
Membertou and twenty other Micmacs, and their
formal baptism on the beach at Port Royal. The
object is, of course, to ward off the threatened invasion
of New France by the Jesuits, by showing how
thoroughly the work of proselyting is being carried
forward without their aid.

II. By the same ship which, in the hands of Poutrincourt's
son, Biencourt, carries to France this ingenious
document, one Bertrand, a Huguenot layman,
sends a message to his friend, the Sieur de la
Tronchaie. In his Lettre Missive, M. Bertrand describes
the conversion of Membertou and his fellow
savages, and speaks with enthusiasm of the new
country: as well he may, for in Volume II. we shall
find Lescarbot testifying that in Paris the worthy
Bertrand was "daily tormented by the gout," while
at Port Royal he was "entirely free" from it.

III. Lescarbot's fervid description of Father
Fl√©ch√©'s conversions did not succeed in keeping the
Jesuits from New France. The present document is
a letter written at Dieppe, by Father Pierre Biard, of
the Society of Jesus, to his general at Rome, telling
of the adventures which had befallen Father Ennemond
Mass√© and himself, since they, the pioneers of
their order in the New World, had been ordered from
France to Port Royal. Certain Huguenot merchants
of Dieppe conspired to prevent the passage of the
Jesuits to America; but finally the queen and other
court ladies, favoring the missionaries, purchased control
of the Huguenots' ship and cargo, and the exultant
fathers are now on the eve of sailing.

47
IV. In this letter, written by Biard to his provincial,
a few weeks after the arrival at Port Royal, the
missionary gives the details of his voyage, describes
the spiritual and material condition of Poutrincourt's
colony, and outlines plans for work among the
Indians&mdash;only Huguenot ministers being, as yet,
allowed under the charter to serve the spiritual needs
of the colonists themselves.

V. In this letter, Biard notifies his general of the
safe arrival of Mass√© and himself.

VI. A like duty is here performed by Mass√©.

VII. Father Jouvency, one of the eighteenth-century
historians of the Society of Jesus, herein gives
an historical account of the Canadian missions of
his order, in 1611-13; and, by way of comparison,
tells of the condition of the same missions in 1703,
ending with a list of the Jesuit missions in North
America in the year 1710, the date of original publication.

VIII. Herein, Jouvency gives a detailed account of
the Indian tribes of Canada,&mdash;their customs, characteristics,
superstitions, etc. Although not in strict
chronological order, these chapters are given here as
being from the same work as the foregoing.

In the preparation of several of the Notes to
Volume I., the Editor has had some assistance from
Mrs. Jane Marsh Parker, of Rochester, N. Y.

MADAME,


Dieu m'ayant fait naitre amateur de ma
nation &amp; zelateur de sa gloire, ie ne puis moins que de luy
faire part de ce qui la touche, &amp; qui sans doute l'√©poin√ßonnera
quand elle entendra que le nom de Iesus-Christ est
annonc√© √©s terres d'outre mer qui portent le nom de France.
Mais particulierement cela regarde v√¥tre Majest√©, laquelle
sur ces nouvelles a rendu vn temoignage du grand contentement [iv]
qu'elle en avoit. La Chr√©tient√© doit ceci au
courage &amp; √† la piet√© du Sieur de Poutrincourt, qui ne
peut viure oisif parmi la tr√£quillit√© en laquelle nous vivons
par le benefice du feu Roy v√¥tre Epoux. Mais (Madame)
si vous desirez bien-tot voir cet &oelig;uvre avanc√©, il faut que
vous y mettiez la main. Donnez luy des ailes pour voler
sur les eaux, &amp; penetrer si avant dans les terres de del√†,
que jusques a l'extremit√© o√π l'Occident se joint √† l'Orient,
tout lieu retentisse du nom de la France. Ie s√ßay qu'il ne
manque de volont√© &amp; fidelit√© au service du Roy &amp; de v√¥tre
Majest√©, pour faire (apres ce qui est de Dieu) que vous
soy√©s obeis par tout le monde. Et pour mon regard en tout
ce que i'ay iamais travaill√©, ie me suis efforc√© de bien
meriter du Roy &amp; du public, ausquels i'ay dedi√© mes
labeurs. [v] S'il m'en arrive quelque fruit, ie le dedieray
volontiers, &amp; tout ce que Dieu m'a donn√© d'industrie, √†
l'accroissement de cette entreprise, &amp; √† ce qui regardera le
bien de v√¥tre service. Cependant ayez (Madame)
agreable ce petit discours evangelique (c'est √† dire portant
bonnes nouvelles) que publie √† la France souz v√¥tre bon
plaisir, Madame, de v√¥tre Majest√© le tres-humble, tres-obe√Øssant,

[iii] To the Queen.

MADAME,


God having created me a lover of my country
and zealous for its glory, I cannot do less than impart to
it whatever affects its interests; and so doubtless it will
be greatly encouraged by the tidings that the name of
Jesus Christ has been proclaimed in the lands beyond the
sea, which bear the name of France. But this news is of
especial interest to your Majesty, who, upon hearing it,
gave evidence of your great satisfaction [iv] therein.

The Christian World owes this event to the courage and
piety of Sieur de Poutrincourt,2 who cannot lead a life of
idleness amid the peaceful prosperity in which we live
through the favor of the deceased King, your Husband.
But (Madame), if you wish to see immediate advancement
in this work, you must lend a helping hand. Give
it wings to fly over the seas, and to penetrate so far into
the lands beyond that, even to the uttermost parts where the
West unites with the East, every place may resound with
the name of France. I know that there is no lack of good-will
and loyalty in the service of the King and of your
Majesty, to the end that (after what is due to God) you
may be obeyed by all mankind. And as for me, in all that
I have ever done, I have endeavored to merit the esteem of
the King and of the public, to whom I have dedicated my
labors. [v] If I gather any fruit therefrom, I shall willingly
consecrate it, and all the energy God has given me, to
the enlargement of this enterprise and to whatever may
concern the welfare of your service. Meanwhile, be pleased
(Madame) to accept this little gospel narrative (gospel,
because bringing good tidings), which is published in France
under your good pleasure, Madame, by your Majesty's
very humble, very obedient and very faithful servant and
subject,



Marc Lescarbot.3

[7] La Conversion des Sauvages qui ont est√©
baptisez en la Nouuelle-France,
cette annee 1610.

Matth. 24. vers. 14.

LA parole immuable de n√¥tre Sauveur Iesus-Christ
nous temoigne par l'organe de sainct Matthieu
que l'Euangile du royaume des cieux sera annonc√©
par tout le monde, pour estre en temoignage √† toutes nations,
avant que la consommation vienne. Nous scavons
par les histoires que la voix des Ap√¥tres a eclat√© par
tout le monde de de√ßa d√©s il y a plusieurs siecles
passez, quoy qu'aujourd'hui les royaumes Chr√©tiens
en soient la moindre partie. Mais quant au nouveau
monde decouvert depuis environ six-vingts ans, nous
n'auons aucun vestige que la parole de Dieu y ait
onques [8] est√© annonc√©e avant ces derniers temps, si ce
n'est que nous voulions adjouter quelque foy √† ce que
Iehan de Leri rapporte, que comme il racontoit vn
jour aux Bresiliens les grandes merveilles de Dieu en
la creation du monde, &amp; mysteres de n√¥tre redemption,
vn vieillart lui dit qu'il auoit oui dire √† son grand
pere qu'autrefois vn homme barbu (or les Bresiliens
ne le sont point) estoit venu vers eux, &amp; leur avoit
dit choses semblables: mais qu'on ne le voulut point
√©couter, &amp; depuis s'estoi&#7869;t entre-tuez &amp; mangez les vns
les autres. Quant aux autres nations de dela quelques
vns ont bien quelque sourde nouvelle du deluge,
&amp; de l'immortalit√© des ames, ensemble dela beatitude
des bi&#7869;vivans apres cette vie, mais ils peuvent
avoir retenu cette obscure doctrine de main en main
par tradition depuis le cataclisme vniversel qui avint
60
au temps de No√©. Reste donc √† deplorer la miserable
condition de ces peuples qui occupent vne terre
si grande, que le monde de de√ßa ne vient en comparaison
avec elle, si nous comprenons la terre qui est
outre le detroit de Magellan dite, [9] Terra del fugo,
tant en son etendu√´ vers la Chine, &amp; le Iapan, que vers
la Nouvelle Guin√©e: comme aussi celle qui est outre
la grande riviere de Canada, qui s'estend vers l'Orient
&amp; est baign√©e de la grande mer Occidentale. Toutes
lesquelles contrees sont en vne miserable ignorance,
&amp; n'y a point d'apparence qu'elles aient onques eu le
v&#7869;t de l'Evangile, sinon qu'en ce dernier siecle l'Hespagnol
parmi la cruaut√© &amp; l'avarice y a apport√©
quelque lumiere de la religion Chr√©tienne. Mais
cela est si peu de chose, qu'on n'en peut pas faire si
grand estat qu'il pourroit sembler, d'autant que par
la confession m√©me de ceux qui en ont √©crit les
histoires ils ont preque tu√© tous les naturels du pa√Øs,
&amp; en fait nombre vn certain historien, de plus de
vingt millions, d√©s il y a soixante dix ans. L'Anglois
depuis vingt-cinq ans a pris pi√© en vne terre qui
git entre la Floride, &amp; le pa√Øs des Armouchiquois,
laquelle terre a est√© appell√©e Virginie en l'honneur
de la defuncte Royne d'Angleterre. Mais cette
nation fait ses affaires si secretement, que peu de gens
en s√ßauent de [10] nouvelles certaines. Peu apres
que i'eu publi√© mon Histoire de la Nouvelle France
on fit vn embarquem&#7869;t de huit cens hommes pour y
envoyer. Il n'est point mention qu'ils se soient lav√©
les mains au sang de ces peuples. En quoy ils ne
sont ni √† lo√ºer, ni √† blamer: car il n'y a aucune loy,
ni aucun pretexte, qui permette de tuer qui que ce
soit, &amp; m√©me ceux des biens desquelz nous-nous emparons.
62
Mais ils sont √† priser s'ils montrent √† ces
pauvres ignorans le chemin de salut par la vraye &amp;
non fard√©e doctrine Evangelique. Quant √† noz Fran√ßois
ie me suis assez plaint en madite Histoire de la
poltronnerie du temps d'aujourd'huy, &amp; du peu de
zele que nous avons soit √† redresser ces pauvres
errans, soit √† faire que le nom de Dieu soit coneu exalt√©
&amp; glorifi√© en ces terres d'outre mer, o√π jamais il
ne le fut. Et toutefois nous voulons que cela porte
le nom de France, nom tant auguste &amp; venerable, que
nous ne pouvons sans honte nous glorifier d'vne
France qui n'est point Chr√©tienne. Ie s√ßay qu'il ne
manque pas de gens de b√µne volont√© pour y aller.
Mais pourquoy [11] l'Eglise, qui possede tant de biens;
mais pourquoy les Grands, qui sont tant de depenses
superflues, ne financent-ilz quelque chose pour l'execution
d'vn si sainct &oelig;uvre? Deux Gentils-hommes
pleins de courage en ces derniers t&#7869;ps se sont trouvez
zel√©s √† ceci, les Sieurs de Monts, &amp; de Poutrincourt,
lesquels √† leurs d√©pens se sont enerv√©s, &amp; ont fait
plus que leurs forces ne pouvoient porter. L'vn &amp;
l'autre ont continu√© jusques √† present leurs voyages.
Mais l'vn a est√© deceu par deux fois, &amp; est tomb√© en
grand interest pour s'estre rendu trop credule aux
paroles de quelques vns. Or d'autant que les dernieres
nouvelles que nous avons de n√¥tre Nouvelle-France
viennent de la part du Sieur de Poutrincourt,
nous dirons ici ce qui est de son fait: &amp; avons iuste
sujet d'exalter son courage, entant que ne pouvant
viure parmi la tourbe des hommes oisifs, dont nous
n'abondons que trop; &amp; voyant n√¥tre France comme
languir au repos d'vn calme ennuieux aux h√µmes de
travail: apres avoir en mille occasions fait preuve de
64
sa valeur depuis vingt quatre ans en√ßa; il a voulu
coroner [12] ses labeurs vrayement Herculeens par la
cause de Dieu, pour laquelle il employe ses moyens
&amp; ses forces, &amp; va hazardant sa vie, pour accroitre le
nombre des citoyens des cieux, &amp; amener √† la bergerie
de Iesus-Christ n√¥tre souverain Pasteur, les
brebis egar√©es, lesquelles il seroit bien-seant aux
Prelats de l'Eglise d'aller recuillir (du moins contribuer
√† cet effect) puis qu'ils en ont le moyen. Mais
avec combien de travaux s'est-il employ√© jusques ici √†
cela? Voici la troisieme fois qu'il passe le grand
Ocean pour parvenir √† ce but. La premiere ann√©e se
passa avec le sieur de Monts √† chercher vne demeure
propre &amp; vn port asseur√© pour la retraite des vaisseaux
&amp; des hommes. Ce qui ne succeda pas bien. La
seconde ann√©e fut employ√©e √† la mesme chose, &amp; lors
il estoit en France. En la troisieme nous fimes
epreuve de la terre, laquelle nous rendit abondamment
le fruict de n√¥tre culture: Cette annee icy
voyant par vne mauvaise experience que les hommes
sont trompeurs, il ne s'est plus voulu attendre √† autre
qu'√† luy-m√©me, &amp; [s']est mis en mer le 26. Fevrier,
ayant eu [13] temps fort contraire en sa navigation,
laquelle a est√© la plus longue dont i'aye jamais ou√Ø
parler. Certes la n√¥tre nous fut fort ennuieuse il y a
trois ans, ayans est√© vagabons l'espace de deux
mois &amp; demi sur la mer avant qu'arriver au Port
Royal. Mais en cette-ci ils ont est√© trois mois
entiers. De sorte qu'vn indiscret se seroit mutin√©
jusques √† faire de mauvaises conspirations: toutesfois
la benignit√© dudit Sieur de Poutrincourt &amp; le respect
du lieu o√π il demeuroit √† Paris, lui ont serui de bouclier
pour luy garentir la vie.
66
Terrir, c'est √† dire decouvrir la terre. La premiere c√¥te o√π
territ iceluy Sieur de Poutrincourt fut au port au
Mouton. De l√† parmi les brou√Øllas qui sont fort frequens
le long de l'Et√© en cette mer, il se trouva en
quelques perils, principalement vers le Cap de Sable,
o√π son vaisseau pensa toucher sur les brisans.
Hist. de la Nouvelle-France liv. 2. chap. 37. p. 527. Depuis
voulant gaigner le Port Royal, il fut port√© par la
violence des vents quarante lieu√´s par-dela, c'est √†
s√ßavoir √† la riviere de Norombega tant celebr√©e &amp;
fabuleusement d√©crite par les Geographes &amp; Historiens,
ainsi que i'ay monstr√© en madite Histoire, l√† o√π
se pourra voir cette navigation par la Table geographique [14]
que i'y ay mise. De-l√† il vint √† la riviere
sainct Iehan qui est vis √† vis du Port Royal pardela
la Baye Fran√ßoise, o√π il trouva vn navire de S. Malo,
qui troquoit avec les Sauvages du pa√Øs. Et l√† il eut
plainte d'vn Capitaine Sauvage qu'vn dudit navire
lui auoit ravi sa femme, &amp; en abusoit: dont ledit
Sieur fit informer, &amp; print celui l√† prisonnier, &amp; le
navire aussi. Mais il laissa aller ledit navire &amp; les
matelots se contentant de garder le malfaiteur: lequel
neantmoins s'evada dans vne chaloupe &amp; se retira
avec les Sauvages, les detournant de l'amiti√© des
Fran√ßois, comme nous dirons ci-apres. En fin arriu√©s
audit Port Royal il ne se peut dire avec combien
de ioye ces pauvres peuples receurent ledit Sieur &amp;
sa compagnie. Et de verit√© le sujet de cette ioye
estoit d'autant plus grand qu'ils n'avoient plus d'esperance
de voir les Fran√ßois habiter aupres d'eux,
desquels ils auoient ressenti les courtoisies lors que
nous y estions, dont se voyans priu√©s, aussi pleuroient
ils √† chaudes larmes quand nous partimes de l√† il y
a trois ans. En ce Port Royal est la demeure [15]
dudict sieur de Poutrincourt, le plus beau sejour que
68
Dieu ait form√© sur la terre, rempar√© d'un rang de 12
ou 15. lieu√´s de montagnes du c√¥t√© du Nort, sur lesquelles
bat le Soleil tout le iour: &amp; de cotaux au c√¥te
du Su, ou Midi: lequel au reste peut contenir vingt
milles vaisseaux en asseurance, ayant vingt brasses de
profond √† son entr√©e, vne lieu√´ &amp; demie de large, &amp;
quatre de long jusques √† vne ile qui a vne lieu√´ Fran√ßoise
de circuit: dans lequel i'ay veu quelquefois √†
l'aise no√ºer vne moyenne Baleine, qui venoit auec le
flot √† huict heures au matin par chacun jour. Au
reste dans ce port se peche en la saison grande quantit√©
de harens, d'eplans, (ou eperlans) sardines, bars,
moru√´s, loups-marins, &amp; autre poissons: &amp; quant aux
coquillages, on y recueille force houmars, crappes,
palourdes, coques, moules, escargots, &amp; chatagines de
mer. Mais qui voudra aller au dessus du flot de la
mer il pechera en la riviere force eturgeons &amp; saumons,
√† la dessaicte desquels il y a vn singulier
plaisir. Or pour reprendre n√¥stre fil, le Sieur de Poutrincourt
arriv√© [6 i.e. 16] l√† a trouv√© ses batimens
tout entiers sans que les Sauvages (ainsi a-on appell√©
ces peuples l√† iusques √† maintenant) y eussent touch√©
en aucune fa√ßon, ny m√©me aux meubles qu'on y avoit
laiss√©. Et soucieux de leurs vieux amis ils demandoient
comme vn chacun d'eux se portoit, les nommant
particulierement par leurs noms communs, &amp; demandans
pourquoy tels &amp; tels n'y estoient retournez. Ceci
demontre vne gr√£de deb√µnairet√© en ce peuple, lequel
aussi ayant en nous reconu toute humanit√©, ne nous
fuit point; comme il fait l'Hespagnol en tout ce
grand monde nouveau. Et consequemment par vne
douceur &amp; courtoisie, qui leur est aussi familiere qu'√†
nous, il est ais√© de les faire plier √† tout ce que l'on
70
voudra, &amp; particulierement pour ce qui touche le
point de la Religion, de laquelle nous leur avions
baill√© de bonnes impressi√µs lors que nous estions aupres
d'eux, &amp; ne desiroient pas mieux que de se ranger souz
la banniere de Iesus-Christ: √† quoy ils eussent est√©
receuz d√©s lors, si nous eussions eu vn pi√© ferme en la
terre. Mais comme nous pensions continuer, [17]
avint que le sieur de Monts ne pouvant plus fournir √†
la depense, &amp; le Roy ne l'assistant point, il fut contraint
de revoquer tous ceux qui estoient pardel√†, lesquels
n'avoient port√© les choses necessaires √† vne plus longue
demeure. Ainsi c'eust est√© temerit√© &amp; folie de conferer
le bapt√©me √† ceux qu'il eust fallu par apres
abandonner, &amp; leur donner sujet de retourner √† leur
vomissement. Mais maintenant que c'est √† bon
escient, &amp; que ledit sieur de Poutrincourt fait pardel√†
sa demeure actuelle, il est loisible de leur imprimer
le charactere Chr√©tien sur le front &amp; en l'ame, apres
les avoir instruit √©s principaux articles de n√¥tre Foy.
Aux Hebr. 11. vers. 6. Ce qu'a eu soin de faire ledit Sieur, sachant ce que dit
l'Ap√¥tre, que celuy qui s'approche de Dieu doibt croire que
Dieu est: &amp; apres cette croyance, peu √† peu on vient
aux choses qui sont plus eloign√©es du sens commun,
comme de croire que d'vn rien Dieu ait fait toutes
choses, qu'il se soit fait homme, qu'il soit nay d'vne
Vierge, qu'il ait voulu mourir pour l'homme, &amp;c. Et
d'autant que les hommes Ecclesiastics qui ont est√©
port√©s pardel√† ne sont encore [18] instruits en la langue
de ces peuples, ledit Sieur a pris la peine de les instruire
&amp; les faire instruire par l'organe de son fils ain√©
jeune Gentilhomme qui entend &amp; parle fort bien ladite
langue, &amp; qui s&#7869;ble estre n√© pour leur ouvrir le chemin
des cieux. Les hommes qui sont au Port Royal,
72
&amp; terres adjacentes tirant vers la Terre-neuve, s'appellent
Souriquois, &amp; ont leur langue propre. Mais
pass√©e la Baye Fran√ßoise, qui a environ 40. lieu√´s de
profond dans les terres, &amp; 10. ou 12. lieu√´s de large,
les hommes de l'autre part s'appellent Etechemins,
&amp; plus loin sont les Armouchiquois peuple distingu√©
de langage de ceux-ci, &amp; lequel est heureux en qu√£tit√©
de belles vignes &amp; gros raisins, s'il s√ßavoit
conoitre l'vtilit√© de ce fruit, lequel (ainsi que nos
vieux Gaullois) il pense estre poison.

ch√£ve excellente que la nature lui donne, laquelle en
beaut√© and b√µt√© passe de beaucoup la n√¥tre: &amp; outre
ce le Sassafras, force chenes, noyers, pruniers, chataigniers,
&amp; autres fruits qui ne sont venus √† n√¥tre
conoissance. Quant au Port Royal ie veux confesser
qu'il n'y a pas [19] tant de fruits: &amp; neantmoins la
terre y est plantureuse pour y esperer tout ce que la
France Gaulloise nous produit. Tous ces peuples se
gouvernent par Capitaines qu'ils appellent Sagamos,
mot qui est pris √©s Indes Orientales en m√©me signification,
ainsi que i'ay leu en l'histoire de Maffeus, &amp;
lequel i'estime venir du mot Hebrieu Sagan, qui signifie
Grand Prince, selon Rabbi David, &amp; quelquefois celui
qui tient le second lieu apres le souverain Pontife.
Esai. 41. vers. 25, Ierem. 51. vers. 23. Santes
Pagnin, 9. En la version ordinaire de la Bible il est pris pour le
Magistrat: &amp; neantmoins l√† m√©me les interpretes Hebrieux
le tourn&#7869;t Prince. Et de fait nous lisons dans
Berose que No√© fut appell√© Saga tant pour ce qu'il
estoit grand Prince, que pour ce qu'il avoit enseign√© la
Theologie, &amp; les ceremonies du service divin, avec
beaucoup de secrets, des choses natureles, aux Scytes
Armeniens, que les anciens Cosmographes appellerent
Sages du nom de No√©. Et paraventure pour cette
74
m√©me consideration ont est√© appell√©s nos Tectosages,
qui sont les Tolosains. Car ce bon pere restaurateur
du monde vint en Italie, &amp; envoya [20] repeupler les
Gaulles apres le Deluge, donnant son nom de Gaulois
(car Xenophon dit qu'il fut aussi appell√© de ce
nom) √† ceux qu'il y envoya, par ce qu'il avoit est√©
echapp√© des eaux. Et n'est pas inconvenient que
lui-m√©me n'ait impos√© le nom aux Tectosages. Revenons
√† n√¥tre mot de Sagamos lequel est le tiltre
d'honneur des Capitaines en ces Terres neuves dont
nous parlons. Au Port Royal le Capitaine, ou Sagamos
dudit lieu s'appelle en son nom Membertou. Il
est √¢g√© de cent ans pour le moins, &amp; peut naturellement
vivre encore plus de cinquante. Il a sous soy
plusieurs familles, ausquelles il commande, non point
avec tant d'authorit√© que fait n√¥tre Roy sur ses
sujets, mais pour haranguer, donner conseil, marcher
√† la guerre, faire raison √† celui qui re√ßoit quelque
injure, &amp; choses s&#7869;blables. Il ne met point d'impost
sur le peuple. Mais s'il y a de la chasse il en a sa
part sans qu'il soit tenu d'y aller. Vray est qu'on lui
fait quelquefois des presens de peaux de Castors, ou
autre chose, quand il est employ√© pour la guerison de
quelque malade, ou pour interroger [21] son d√¶mon
(qu'il appelle Aoutem) afin d'auoir nouvelle de quelque
chose future, ou absente: car chaque village, ou
compagnie de Sauvages, ayant vn Aoutmoin, c'est √†
dire Devin, qui fait cet office, Membertou est celui
qui de grande anciennet√© √† prattiqu√© cela entre ceux
parmi lesquels il a convers√©. Si bien qu'il est en
credit pardessus tous les autres Sagamos du pa√Øs, ai√£t
d√©s sa jeunesse est√© grand Capitaine, &amp; parmi cela
exerc√© l'office de Devin &amp; de Medecin, qui sont les
76
trois choses plus efficaces √† obliger les hommes, &amp; √†
se rendre necessaire en ceste vie humaine. Or ce
Membertou aujourd'huy par la grace de Dieu est
Chr√©tien avec toute sa famille, aiant est√© baptiz√©, &amp;
vingt autres apres lui, le jour sainct Iehan dernier 24.
Iuin. I'en ay lettres dudit Sieur de Poutrincourt en
datte du vnzieme jour de Iuillet ensuivant. Ledit
Membertou a est√© nomm√© du nom de n√¥tre feu bon
Roy Henry IIII. &amp; son fils ain√© du nom de Monseigneur
le Dauphin aujourd'huy n√¥tre Roy Lovis
XIII. que Dieu benie. Et ainsi consequemment la
femme de Membertou a [22] est√© nomm√©e Marie du
nom de la Royne Regente, &amp; √† sa fille a est√© impos√©
le nom de la Roine Margverite. Le second fils de
Membertou dit Actaudin fut nomm√© Pavl du nom de
n√¥tre sainct Pere le Pape de Rome. La fille du susdit
Louis eut nom Christine en l'honneur de Madame
la s&oelig;ur ainee du Roy. Et consequemment √† chacun
fut impos√© le nom de quelque illustre, ou notable personnage
de de√ßa. Plusieurs autres Sauvages estoient
lors allez cabanner ailleurs (comme c'est leur coutume
de se disperser par bendes quand l'est√© est venu) lors
de ces solennitez de regeneration Chr√©tienne, lesquels
nous estimons estre aujourd'huy enroll√©s en la
famille de Dieu par le m√©me lavem&#7869;t du sainct bapteme.
Mais le diable, qui iamais ne dort, en ceste
occurrence ici a t√©moign√© la jalousie qu'il avoit du
salut annonc√© √† ce peuple, &amp; de voir que le nom de
Dieu fust glorifi√© en cette terre: ayant suscit√© vn
mauvais Fran√ßois, non Fran√ßois, mais Turc: non
Turc, mais Ath√©e, pour detourner du sentier de salut
plusieurs Sauvages qui estoient Chr√©tiens en leur ame
&amp; de [23] volont√© d√©s il y a trois ans: &amp; entre autres vn
78
Sagamos nomm√© Chkoudun homme de grand credit,
duquel i'ay fait honorable m&#7869;tion en mon Histoire de
la Nouvelle-Fr√£ce, par ce que je l'ay veu sur tous
autres aymer les Fran√ßois, &amp; qu'il admiroit nos inventions
au pris de leur ignorance: m√©mes que s'estant
quelquefois trouv√© aux remontrances Chr√©tiennes qui
se faisoient par-de l√† √† noz Fr√£√ßois par chacun
Dimanche, il s'y rendoit attentif, encores qu'il n'y
ent&#7869;dist rien: &amp; davantage avoit pendu devant sa
poitrine le signe de la Croix, lequel il faisoit aussi
porter √† ses domestics &amp; avoit √† n√¥tre imitation plant√©
vne grande Croix en la place de son village dit
Oigoudi, sur le port de la riuiere sainct Iehan, √† dix
lieu√´s du port Royal. Or cet homme avec les
autres, a est√© d√©tourn√© d'estre Chr√©tien par l'avarice
maudite de ce mauvais Fran√ßois que i'ay touch√© ci-dessus,
lequel ie ne veux n√µmer pour cette heure pour
l'amour &amp; reverence que ie porte √† son pere, mais
avec protestation de l'eterniser s'il ne s'amende.
Celui-l√†, di-ie, pour attraper quelques Castors de ce Sagamos
[24] Chkoudun, l'alla en Iuin dernier suborner,
apres s'estre euad√© des mains dudit Sieur de Poutrincourt,
dis√£t que tout ce qu'icelui Poutrincourt leur
disoit de Dieu n'estoit rien qui vaille, qu'il ne le falloit
point croire, &amp; que c'estoit vn abuseur, &amp; qu'il
les feroit mourir pour avoir leurs Castors. Ie laisse
beaucoup de mechans discours qu'il peut avoir adjout√©
√† cela. S'il estoit de la Religion de ceux qui se
disent Reformez ie l'excuserois aucunement: mais
il m√µtre bien qu'il n'est ni de l'vne, ny de l'autre.
Si diray-ie toutefois qu'il a sujet de remercier Dieu
du d√£ger o√π il s'est veu en n√¥tre voiage. Ce Sagamos
pouvoit estant Chr√©tien en r&#7869;dre bon nombre
80
semblables √† lui, √† son imitation. Mais ie veux
esperer, ou plustot croire pour certain qu'il ne demeurera
plus gueres long t&#7869;ps en cet erreur, &amp; que
ledit Sieur aura trouv√© moyen de l'attirer (avec beaucoup
d'autres) pres de soy, pour luy imprimer derechef
les vives persuasions dont il luy avoit autrefois
touch√© l'ame en ma presence. Car l'esprit de Dieu
est puissant pour faire t√µber sur ce champ vne nouvelle
rousee, qui fera regermer ce que la grele a
dessech√© &amp; abbatu. Dieu vueille par sa grace conduire
le tout en sorte que la chose re√ºssisse √† sa gloire
&amp; √† l'edification de ce peuple, pour lequel tous Chr√©tiens
doivent faire continuelles prieres √† sa divine
bont√©, √† ce qu'il lui plaise confirmer &amp; avancer
l'&oelig;uvre qu'il lui a pleu susciter en ce temps pour
l'exaltation de son nom, &amp; le salut de ses creatures.

FIN.

[25] Il y a pardela des hommes d'Eglise de bon s√ßavoir
que le seul zele de la Religion y a port√©, lesquels
ne manqueront de faire tout ce que la piet√© requerra
en ce regard. Or quant √† present il n'est pas besoin
de ces Docteurs sublimes, qui peuvent estre plus vtiles
parde√ßa √† combattre les vices &amp; les heresies. Ioint
qu'il y a certaine sorte de gens desquels on ne se peut
pas bien asseurer faisans m√©tier de censurer tout ce
qui ne vient √† leurs maximes, &amp; voulans commander
par tout. Il suffit d'estre veill√© au dehors sans avoir
de ces epilogueurs qui considerent tous les mouvemens
de v√¥tre corps &amp; de v√¥tre c&oelig;ur pour en faire
regitres, desquels les plus grands Rois m√©mes ne se
peuv&#7869;t defendre. Et puis, que serviroi&#7869;t pardela t√£t
de gens de cette sorte, qu√£t √† present, si ce n'est qu'ils
82
voulussent s'addonner √† la culture de la terre? Car
ce n'est pas tout que d'aller l√†. Il faut considerer ce
que l'on y fera y estant arriv√©. Pour ce qui est de
la demeure du Sieur de Poutrincourt il s'est fourni au
depart de ce qui lui estoit necessaire. Mais s'il prenoit
envie √† quelques gens de bien d'y [26] avancer l'Evangile,
ie seroy d'avis qu'ils fissent cinq ou six bandes,
avec chacun vn navire bien equipp√©, &amp; qu'ils allassent
planter des colonies en diverses places de ces quartiers
l√†, comme √† Tadoussac, Gachep√©, Campseau, la H√©ve,
Oigoudi, Saincte Croix, Pemptegoet, Kinibeki, &amp;
autres endroits o√π sont les assembl√©es de Sauvages,
lesquels il faut que le temps ameine √† la Religion
Chr√©tienne: si ce n'est qu'vn grand Pere de famille
tel que le Roy en vueille avoir la gloire totale, &amp; face
habiter ces lieux. Car d'y penser vivre √† leur mode
i'estime cela estre hors de n√¥tre pouvoir.
Fa√ßon de
vivre des Souriquois
&amp; Ethechemins. Et pour le
montrer, leur fa√ßon de vivre est telle, que depuis la
premiere terre (qui est la Terre-neuve) insques aux
Armouchiquois, qui sont pres de trois cens lieu√´s, les
hommes vivent vagabons, sans labourage, n'estans
iamais plus de cinq ou six semaines en vn lieu.
Pline √† fait mention de certains peuples dits Ichthyophages,
c'est √† dire Mangeurs de poissons, viuans de
cela. Ceux ci sont tout de m√©me les trois parts de l'ann√©e.
Car venant le Print&#7869;ps ils se divisent par troupes
sur les rives de mer insques √† [27] l'Hiver, lequel
ven√£t, par ce que le poiss√µ se retire au fond des grandes
eaux sal√©es, ilz cherchent les lacs &amp; ombres des bois,
o√π ilz pechent les Castors, dont ilz viv&#7869;t, &amp; d'autres
chasses, comme Ellans, Caribous, Cerfs, &amp; autres animaux
moindres que ceux-l√°. Et neantmoins quelquefois,
en Et√© m√©me ilz ne laissent point de chasser: &amp;
84
d'ailleurs ont infinie quantit√© d'oyseaux en certaines
iles √©s mois de May, Iuin, Iuillet, &amp; Aoust.
le coucher. Quant √† leur coucher, vne peau etendue sur la terre leur
sert de matelas. Et en cela n'avons dequoy nous
mocquer d'eux, par ce que noz vieux peres Gaullois
en faisoient de m√©me, &amp; dinoi&#7869;t aussi sur des peaux de
chiens &amp; de loups, si Diodore &amp; Strabon disent vray.
Armouchiquois. Mais quant au pais des Armouchiquois &amp; Iroquois, il
y a plus grande moisson √† faure pour ceux qui sont
poussez d'vn zele religieux, par ce que le peuple y est
beaucoup plus frequent, &amp; cultive la terre, de laquelle
il retire vn grand soulagement de vie. Vray est qu'il
n'entent pas bien la fa√ß√µ de faire le pain, n'ayant les
inventi√µs des moulins, ni du levain, ni des fours; ains
broye son bl√© en certaine fa√ßon de [28] mortiers, &amp;
l'emp√¢te au mieux qu'il peut pour le faire cuire entre
deux pierres echauff√©es au feu: ou bien rotit ledit
bl√© en epic sur la braise, ainsi que faisoient les vieux
Romains, au dire de Pline.
Plin. liv. 18. chap. 2. &amp; 10.
Depuis on trouva le moyen de faire des gateaux souz la cendre: &amp; depuis
encore les boulengers trouverent la fa√ßon des fours.
Or ces peuples cultivans la terre sont arret√©s, ce que
les autres ne sont point, n'ayans rien de propre, tels
qu'estoient les Allemans au temps de Tacite, lequel a
d√©crit leurs anciennes fa√ßons de vivre.
Iroquois.
Plus avant dans les terres au dessus des Armouchiquois sont les
Iroquois peuples aussi arret√©s, par-ce qu'ilz cultivent
la terre, d'o√π ils recueillent du bl√© mahis (ou Sarazin)
d√©s f√©ves, des b√µnes racines, &amp; bref tout ce que nous
avons dit du pays desdits Armouchiquois, voire encore
plus, car par necessit√© ilz vivent de la terre, estans
loin de la mer. Neantmoins ils ont vn grand lac
d'√©tendue merveilleuse, comme d'environ 60. lieu√´s,
86
√† lentour duquel ils sont cab√£n√©s. Dans ledit lac
il y a des iles belles &amp; grandes, habit√©es desdits Iroquois,
qui sont vn grand peuple, &amp; plus on va [29]
avant dans les terres plus on les trouve habit√©es:
Nouveau Mexique.
si bien que (s'il en faut croire les Hespagnols) au pays
dit le Nouveau Mexique bien loin pardela lesdits Iroquois,
en tirant au Suro√ºest, il y a des villes baties,
&amp; des maisons √† trois &amp; quatre etages: m√©me du
bestial priv√©: d'o√π ils ont appell√© vne certaine riviere
Rio de las Vaccas, La riviere des Vaches, pour y en
avoir veu en grand nombre paturer le l√µg de la
riviere. Grand lac outre Canada.Et est-ce pays directement au Nort √† plus de
cinq cens lieu√´s du vieil Mexique, avoisinant, comme
ie croy, l'extremit√© du grand lac de la riviere de
Canada, lequel (selon le rapport des Sauvages) a trente
journ√©es de long. Ie croiroy que des hommes robustes
&amp; bien compos√©s pourroient vivre parmi ces
peuples l√†, &amp; faire grand fruit √† l'avancement de la
Religion Chr√©tienne. Mais quant aux Souriquois, &amp;
Etechemins, qui sont vagabons &amp; divis√©s, il les faut
assembler par la culture de la terre, &amp; obliger par
ce moyen √† demeurer en vn lieu. Car quiconque a
pris la peine de cultiver vne terre il ne la quitte
point aisement. Il c√µbat pour la conserver de tout
son courage. [30] Mais ie trouve ce dessein de longue
execution si nous n'y allons d'autre zele, &amp; si vn Roy
ou riche Prince ne prent cette cause en main, laquelle
certes est digne d'vn royaume tres-Chr√©tien.
Conquete de la Palestine comparee √† celle de la Nouvelle-France.
On a jadis fait tant de depenses &amp; pertes d'hommes √† la reconqueste
de la Palestine, √† quoy on a peu proufit√©: &amp;
aujourd'hui √† peu de frais on pourroit faire des merveilles,
&amp; acquerir infinis peuples √† Dieu sans coup
ferir: &amp; nous sommes touch√©s d'vne ie ne s√ßay quelle
88
lethargie en ce qui est du zele religieux qui bruloit noz
peres anciennement. Si on n'esperoit aucun fruit temporel
en ceci ie pardonnerois √† l'imbecillit√© humaine.
Mais il y a de si certaines esperances d'vne b√µne vsure,
qu'elles ferment la bouche √† tous les ennemis de ce
pays l√†, lesquels le decrient afin de ne perdre la traite
des Castors &amp; autres pelleteries dont ils vivent, &amp; sans
cela mourroyent de faim, ou ne s√ßauroient √† quoy
s'employer.
Au Roy &amp; √† la Royne.Que s'il plaisoit au Roy, &amp; √† la Royne
Regente sa mere, en laquelle Dieu a allume vn brasier
de piet√©, prendre goust √† ceci (c√µme certes elle a faict
au rapport de la Conversi√µ des Sauvages baptiz√©s par le
[31] soin du Sieur de Poutrincourt) &amp; laisser quelque
memoire d'elle, ou plustot s'asseurer de la beatitude
des cieux par cette action qui est toute de Dieu, on
ne peut dire quelle gloire √† l'avenir ce lui seroit
d'estre la premiere qui auroit plant√© l'Evangile en de
si grandes terres, qui (par maniere de dire) n'ont
point de bornes. Si Helene mere de l'Empereur
C√µstantin eust trouv√© tant de sujet de bien-faire, elle
eust beaucoup mieux aim√© edifier √† Dieu des temples
vivans que tant d'edifices de marbre dont elle a rempli
la terre saincte. Et au bout l'esperance de la remuneration
temporelle n'en est po&#297;t vaine. Car
d'une part le Sieur de Poutrincourt demeure toujours
serviteur du Roy en la terre que sa Maiest√© luy a
octroy√©e: en laquelle il seroit le rendezvous &amp; support
de tant de vaisseaux qui vont tous les ans aux
Terres neuves, o√π ilz re√ßoivent mille incommodit√©s,
&amp; en perit grand nombre, comme nous avons veu &amp;
oui dire. Moyens pour aller aux Molucques par le Ponant &amp; le Nort.Dailleurs penetrant dans les terres, nous
pourrions nous rendre familier le chemin de la Chine,
&amp; des Molucques par vn climat &amp; parallele t&#7869;per√©, en
90
faisant quelques stati√µs ou [32] demeures au Saut de la
grande riviere de Canada, puis aux lacs qui sont plus
outre, le dernier desquels n'est pas loin de la grande
mer Occidentale, par laquelle les Hespagnols vont
aujourd'hui en l'Orient: Ou bien on pouroit faire la
m√©me entreprise par la riviere de Saguenay, outre
laquelle les Sauvages rapportent qu'il y a vne mer
dont ilz n'ont veu le bout, qui est sans doute ce
passage par le Nort, lequel en vain l'on a tant recherch√©.
Vtilit√©s.De sorte que nous aurions des epices, &amp;
autres drogues sans les mendier desdits Hespagnols, &amp;
demeureroit √©s mains du Roy le proufit qu'il tire de
nous sur ces denr√©es: Laissant √† part l'vtilit√© des
cuirs, paturages, pecheries, &amp; autres biens. Mais il
faut semer avant que recuillir. Par ces exercices on
occuperoit beaucoup de ieunesse Fran√ßoise, dont vne
partie languit ou de pauvret√©, ou d'oisivet√©: ou
vont aux provinces etrangeres enseigner les metiers
qui nous estoient iadis propres &amp; particuliers, au
moyen dequoy la France estoit remplie de biens, au
lieu qu'aujourd'hui vne longue paix ne l'a encore peu
remettre en son premier lustre, tant [33] pour la raison
que dessus, que pour le nombre de gens oisifs, &amp; mendians
valides &amp; volontaires que le public nourrit.
Chiquanerie.Entre lesquelles incommodit√©s on pourrait mettre
encore le mal de la chiquanerie qui mange nostre nation,
d√µt elle a est√© blam√©e de tout temps. A quoy
Ammi√£ Marcellin.seroit aucunement obvi√© par les frequ&#7869;tes navigations:
estant ainsi qu'une partie de ceux qui plaident auroient
plustot fait de conquester nouvelle terre, demeurans
en l'obeissance du Roy, que de poursuivre ce
qu'ilz debattent avec tant de ruines, longueurs, solicitudes,
&amp; travaux. Et en ce ie repute heureux tous
92
ces pauvres peuples que ie deplore ici.
Felicit√© des Sauvages.Car la blafarde
Envie ne les amaigrit po&#297;t ilz ne ressentent point
les inhumanit√©s d'vn qui sert Dieu en torticoli, pour
souz cette couleur tourmenter les hommes; ilz ne
sont point sujets au calcul de ceux qui manquans de
vertu &amp; de bont√© s'affublent d'vn faux pretexte de
piet√© pour nourrir leur ambition. S'ilz ne conoissent
point Dieu, au moins ne le blasphement ilz point,
comme font la pluspart des Chretiens. Ilz ne s√ßavent
que c'est d'empoisonner, ni de corrompre la [34]
chastet√© par artifice diabolique. Il n'y a point de
pauvres, ny de mendians entre eux. Tous sont
riches, entant que tous travaillent &amp; vivent. Mais
entre nous il va bien autrement. Car il y en a plus
de la moiti√© qui vit du labeur d'autrui, ne faisant aucun
metier qui soit necessaire √† la vie humaine. Que si ce
pa√Øs l√† estoit etabli, tel y a qui n'ose faire ici ce qu'il
feroit l√†.
Pour ceux qui vont en la N. France.Il n'ose point ici estre bucheron, laboureur,
vigneron, &amp;c. par ce que s√µ pere est chiquaneur,
barbier, apothicaire &amp;c. Et l√† il oublieroit toutes ces
aprehensions de reproche, &amp; prendroit plaisir √† cultiver
sa terre, ayant beaucoup de compagnons d'aussi
bonne maison que lui. Et cultiver la terre c'est le
metier le plus innocent, &amp; plus certain, exercice de
ceux de qui nous sommes tous descendus, &amp; de ces
braves Capitaines Romains qui s√ßavoient domter &amp; ne
point estre domt√©s. Mais depuis que la pompe &amp; la
malice se sont introduits parmi les hommes, ce qui
estoit vertu a tourn√© en reproche, &amp; les faineans sont
venus en estime.
A la Royne.Or laissons ces gens l√†, &amp; revenons
au Sieur de Poutrincourt, ains plustot a vous, √¥ Royne
Tres-Chretienne, [35] la plus grande, &amp; plus cherie
des cieux que l'&oelig;il du monde voye en la r√µde qu'il fait
94
chaque iour alentour de cet vnivers. Vous qui av√©s
le maniement du plus noble Empire dici bas, Quoy
souffrirez vous de voir vn Gentil-h√µme de si bonne
volont√© sans l'employer &amp; sans le secourir? Voulez
vous qu'il emporte la premiere gloire du monde par
dessus vous, &amp; que le triomphe de cet affaire luy demeure
sans que vous y participi√©s? Non, non, Madame,
il faut que le tout vous en soit rapport√©, &amp; que
c√µme les etoilles empruntent leur lumiere du soleil,
aussi que du Roy &amp; de vous qui nous l'av√©s d√µn√©
toutes les belles acti√µs des Fran√ßois dep&#7869;dent. Il
faut donc prevenir cette gloire, &amp; ne la ceder √† autre,
tandis que vous av√©s vn Poutrincourt bon Fran√ßois,
&amp; qui a servi le feu Roy de regretable memoire v√¥tre
Epoux (que Dieu absolve) en des affaires d'Estat dont
les histoires ne font mention.: En haine dequoy sa
maison &amp; ses biens ont pass√© par l'examen du feu.
Il ne passe point l'Ocean pour voir le pa√Øs, comme
ont fait pr√©que tous les autres qui ont entrepris de
semblables navigations [36] aux d√©pens de noz Roys.
Mais il m√µtre par effect quelle est son intenti√µ, si bien
qu'on n'en peut point douter, &amp; ne hazarderez rien
maintenant quand v√¥tre Majest√© l'employera √† bon
escient √† l'amplificati√µ de la religion Chr√©tienne √©s
terres Occidentales d'outre mer. Vous reconoissez
son zele, le v√¥tre est incomparable, mais il faut aviser
o√π se pourra mieux faire v√¥tre emploite. Ie lou√´ les
Princesses &amp; Dames qui depuis quinze ans ont d√µn√©
de leurs biens pour le repos de ceux ou celles qui se
veulent sequestrer du monde. Mais i'estime (sauf
correction) que leur piet√© seroit plus illustre si elle se
montroit envers ces pauvres peuples Occidentaux qui
gemissent, &amp; dont le defaut d'instruction crie vengeance
96
√† Dieu contre ceux qui les peuvent ayder √†
estre Chr√©tiens, &amp; ne le font pas. Vne Royne de
Castille a est√© cause que la religion Chr√©tienne a est√©
port√©e √©s terres que tient l'Hespagnol en Occident:
faites √¥ lumiere des Roynes du monde, que par vous
bientot on oye eclater le nom de Dieu par tout ce
monde nouveau o√π il n'est point encore coneu. Or
reprenant le fil de m√µ [37] Histoire, puisque nous avons
parl√© du voyage dudit Sieur de Poutrincourt, il ne
sera point hors de propos si apres avoir touch√© les incommodit√©s
&amp; longueurs de sa navigation, qui l'ont
recul√© d'vn an, nous disons vn mot du retour de son
vaisseau. Ce qui sera bref, d'autant qu'ordinairement
sont br√©ves les navigations qui se font des terres Occidentales
en de√ßa hors le Tropique du Cancre.

Que c'est
ce Banc
Voy la dite
Histoire
liv. 2.
chap. 24.Ceci e est√© cause que ledit Sieur de Poutrincourt renvoyant
son fils en France pour faire nouvelle charge,
il a demeur√© aussi long temps √† gaigner le grand Banc
aux Moru√´s depuis le Port Royal, comme √† gaigner
la France depuis ledit Banc: &amp; toutefois depuis icelui
Banc jusques √† la terre de France il y a huit cens
bonnes lieu√´s: &amp; de l√† m√©me jusques audit Port Royal
il n'y en a gueres [38] plus de trois cens. C'est sur
ledit Banc qu'on trouve ordinairement tout l'Et√© force
navires qui font la Pecherie des Moru√´s qu'on apporte
parde√ßa, lesquelles on appelle Moru√´s de Terre-neuve.
Ainsi le fils dudit Sieur de Poutrincourt (dit
98
le Baron de Sainct Iust) arriv√£t audit Banc fit provision
de viande freche, &amp; pecherie de poisson.
La maniere
de
cette pecherie,
voy au
lieu sus-dit.En quoy faisant il eut en rencontre vn navire Rochelois
&amp; vn autre du Havre de Grace, d'o√π il eut nouvelles
de la mort lamentable de n√¥tre defunct bon Roy, sans
s√ßavoir par qui, ni comment. Mais apres eut en rencontre

gens du Sieur de Monts partirent du Havre de Grace
neuf ou dix jours apres ledit jour 26. F√©vrier pour aller
√† Kebec, 40. lieu√´s pardela [39] la riviere de Saguenay,
o√π icelui Sieur de Monts s'est fortifi√©. Mais ilz
furent contraints de relacher pour les mauvais vents.
Et l√† dessus courut vn bruit que le Sieur de Poutrincourt

que si jamais quelque chose de bon re√ºssit de la Nouvelle-France
la posterit√© en aura de l'obligati√µ audit
Sieur de Monts autheur de ces choses, auquel si on
n'eust point ot√© le privilege qui lui avoit est√© baill√©
pour la traite de Castors &amp; autres pelleteries, aujourd'hui
nous aurions force bestiaux, arbres fruictiers,
peuples, &amp; batim&#7869;s en ladite province. Car il a
desir√© ardamment de voir pardela les affaires etablies √†
100
l'honneur de Dieu &amp; de la France. Et ja√ßoit qu'on
lui ait ot√© le sujet de continuer, si ne s'est il point
decourag√© jusques √† present de faire ce qu'il a peu,
ayant fait batir vn Fort audit Kebec, avec des logemens
fort beaux &amp; commodes. En ce lieu de Kebec
cette [40] grande &amp; immense riviere de Canada est reduite
√† l'√©troit, &amp; n'a que la port√©e d'vn fauconneau
de large, ab√µdante en poissons autant que riviere du
monde. Pour le pays il est beau √† merveilles, &amp;
abondant en chasse. Mais estant en pays plus froid
que le port Royal, assavoir quatre vingtz lieu√´s plus
au Nort, aussi la pelleterie y est elle beaucoup plus
belle. Car (entre autres) les Renars y sont noirs, &amp;
d'vn poil si beau, qu'il semble faire honte √† la Martre.
Les Sauvages du Port Royal y peuvent aller en dix
ou douze jours par le moyen des rivieres sur lesquelles
ils navigent pr√©que jusques √† la source, &amp; de
l√† portans leurs petits canots d'√©corce par quelque
espace dans les bois, ils gaignent vne autre riviere qui
va tomber dans ledit fleuve de Canada, &amp; ainsi expedient
bien-tot de l√µgs voyages: ce que de nous-m√©mes
ne s√ßaurions faire en l'etat qu'est le pa√Øs. Et par mer
audit Kebec il y a dudit Port Royal plus de quatre
cens lieu√´s en allant par le Cap Breton. Ledit Sieur
de Monts y auoit envoy√© des vaches d√©s il y a deux
ans &amp; demi, mais faute de quelque femme de village
qui entendist le [41] gouvernement d'icelles, on en a
laiss√© mourir la pluspart en se dechargeant de leurs

Femmes

Quant √† moy ie seray toujours d'auis qu'en quelque

C'est pourquoy ie me mocque de ces mysogames qui

Voyage
aux Iroquois.L'Et√© venu assavoir il y a vn an, ledit Champlein desireux
de voir le pa√Øs des Iroquois, afin qu'en son absence
les Sauvages ne se saisissent point de son Fort, il leur
persuada d'aller l√† faire la guerre, &amp; partirent avec
lui &amp; deux autres Fran√ßois, en n√µbre de quatre-vingts
ou cent, iusques au lac desdits Iroquois, √† deux c&#7869;s
lie√ºes loin dudit Kebec.
Peuples
ennemis.De tout temps il y a eu
guerre entre ces deux nations, comme entre les Souriquois
&amp; Armouchiquois: &amp; se sont quelquefois elev√©s
les Iroquois jusques au n√µbre de huit mille hommes,
pour guerroyer &amp; exterminer tous ceux qui habitoient
104
la grande riviere de Canada: comme il est √† croire
qu'ils ont fait, d'autant que l√† n'est plus aujourd'hui le
langage qui s'y parloit au [43] temps de Iacques Quartier,
qui y fut il y a quatre-vingts ans.
Guerre.Ledit Champlein avec ses troupes arriv√© l√†, ilz ne se peurent si
bien cacher qu'ilz ne fussent apperceuz de ces peuples,
qui ont toujours des sentinelles sur les aven√ºes de
leurs ennemis: &amp; s'estans les vns &amp; les autres bien
rempar√©s, il fut convenu entre eux de ne point combattre
pour ce jour l√†, mais de remettre l'affaire au
lendemain. Le temps lors estoit serein: si bien que
l'Aurore n'eut point plutot chass√© les ombres de la
nuit, que la rumeur s'eme√ªt par tout le camp. Quelque
enfant perdu des Iroquois ayant voulu sortir de
ses rempars, fut transperc√© non d'un trait d'Apollon,
ou de l'Archerot aux yeux bend√©s, mais d'un vray
trait materiel &amp; bien poignant qui le mit √† la renverse.
L√† dessus, la colere monte au front des offens√©s
&amp; chacun se met en ordre pour attaquer &amp; se
defendre. Comme la troupe des Iroquois s'avan√ßoit,
Champlein qui avoit charg√© son mousquet √† deux
balles, voyant deux Iroquois marcher devant avec des
panaches sur la t√™te, se douta que c'estoient deux Capitaines,
&amp; voulut s'avancer [44] pour les mirer. Mais
les Sauvages de Kebec l'empecherent, disans: Il
n'est pas bon qu'ilz te voyent, car incontinent, n'ayans
point accoutum√© de voir telles gens, ilz s'en
fuiront. Mais retire toy derriere le premier rang des
n√¥tres, &amp; puis quand nous serons prets, tu devanceras.
Ce qu'il fit: &amp; par ce moyen furent les deux Capitaines
tout ensemble emport√©s d'vn coup de mousquet.
Victorie.Lors victoire gaign√©e. Car chacun se debende,
&amp; ne restoit qu'√† poursuivre. Tabagie,
c'est fest&#297;. Ce qui fut fait avec
106

[7] The Conversion of the Savages who have
been baptized in New France during
this year, 1610.

Matth. 24, verse 14.

THE unchangeable word of our Savior Jesus Christ
bears witness to us through the lips of saint
Matthew that This Gospel of the kingdom, shall
be preached in the whole world, for a testimony to all
nations, and then shall the consummation come. History
shows that the voice of the Apostles has resounded for
several centuries past throughout all the old world,
although to-day the Christian kingdoms form the
smallest part of it. But as to the new world, discovered
some hundred and twenty years ago, we
have no proof that the word of God has ever [8]
been proclaimed there prior to these later times;
unless we are to believe the story of Jean de Lery,5
who says that one day as he was telling the Brazilians
about the great miracles of God in the creation
of the world, and the mysteries of our redemption,
an old man told him that he had heard his
grandfather say that, many years before, a bearded
man (Brazilians have no beards) had come among
them and had related something similar; but that
they would not listen to him, and since then had
been killing and eating each other. As to the other
countries beyond the sea, some of them have indeed
a certain vague knowledge of the deluge, and of the
immortality of the soul, together with the future reward
of those who live aright; but they might have
handed this obscure doctrine down, from generation
to generation, since the universal deluge which hap

61pened
in the time of Noah. It remains now to
deplore the wretched condition of these people who
occupy a country so large that the old world bears no
comparison with it, if we include the land which lies
beyond the straits of Magellan, called [9] Terra del
fugo, extending as far toward China and Japan as
toward New Guinea; and also the country beyond
the great river of Canada,6 which stretches out to the
East and is washed by the great Western ocean.
Dense ignorance prevails in all these countries, where
there is no evidence that they have ever felt the
breath of the Gospel, except in this last century when
the Spaniard carried thither some light of the Christian
religion, together with his cruelty and avarice.7
But this was so little that it should not receive much
consideration, since by the very confession of those
who have written their histories, they have killed
almost all the natives of the country, who, only seventy
years ago, according to a certain historian,8 numbered
more than twenty millions. For more than
twenty-five years, the English have retained a foothold
in a country called, in honor of the deceased
Queen of England, Virginia, which lies between
Florida and the land of the Armouchiquois.9 But that
country carries on its affairs with so much secrecy,
that very few persons know [10] anything definite
about it. Soon after I published my History of New
France,10 there was an embarkation of eight hundred
men to be sent there. It is not reported that they
bathed their hands in the blood of those people, for
which they are neither to be praised nor blamed: for
there is no law nor pretext which permits us to kill
anyone, whosoever he may be, and especially the persons
whose property we have seized. But they are
63
to be commended if they show to these poor ignorant
people the way of salvation by the true and unvarnished
doctrine of the Gospel. As to our French
people, I have complained enough in my History of
the cowardice of these later times, and of our lack of
zeal either in reclaiming these poor erring ones, or in
making known, exalted, and glorified, the name of
God in the lands beyond the seas, where it never has
been proclaimed. And yet we wish that country to
bear the name of France, a name so august and
venerable that we cannot, without a feeling of shame,
glory in an un-Christianized France. I know that
there are any number of people who are willing to go
there. But why is it that [11] the Church, which has
so much wealth; why is it that the Nobility, who expend
so much needlessly, do not establish some fund
for the execution of so holy a work? Two courageous
Gentlemen, Sieurs de Monts and de Poutrincourt,
have in these later times shown such great zeal in this
work, that they have weakened their resources by
their outlays, and have done more than their strength
justified them in doing. Both have continued their
voyages up to the present time. But one of them
has been frustrated twice, and has had heavy losses
through too great confidence in the words of certain
persons. Now, inasmuch as the latest news of our
New France comes from Sieur de Poutrincourt, we
shall speak here of what he has accomplished, and
we have good reason to praise his courage; for (not
being able to live among the crowd of idle men, of
whom we have only too many, and seeing our France
seeming to languish in a monotonous calm that was
wearisome to men of action), after having given a
thousand proofs of his valor, during the last twenty-
65four
years, he sought to crown [12] his truly Herculean
labors in the cause of God, for which he employs his
means and strength, and endangers his life, by increasing
the number of celestial citizens, and leading
to the fold of Jesus Christ, our sovereign Shepherd,
the wandering sheep, whom it would be becoming to
the Prelates of the Church to go out and gather in (at
least to contribute to this end) since they have the
means of doing so. But with what difficulty has he
labored in this cause up to the present time? Thrice
has he crossed the great Ocean to carry on his enterprises.
The first year was passed with sieur de
Monts in seeking a suitable dwelling and a safe port
for the withdrawal of the ships and their crews.
In this, they did not meet with much success. The
second year passed in the same way, and then he returned
to France. During the third year, we experimented
with the soil, which yielded abundantly to
our cultivation. This present year, discovering
through an unfortunate experience that men are not
always to be trusted, he made up his mind to depend
upon no one but himself, and put to sea on the twenty-sixth
of February; the [13] weather being very unfavorable,
he made the longest voyage of which I
have ever heard; certainly our own, three years ago,
was tedious enough, when we drifted about upon the
sea for the space of two months and a half before
reaching Port Royal. But this one lasted three whole
months, so that one reckless man was about to
mutiny, going so far as to form wicked conspiracies;
but Sieur de Poutrincourt's kindness, and respect for
the place where he lived in Paris, served as a shield
to protect his life. Terrir,
meaning to
discover
the land.The first coast which Sieur de
Poutrincourt discovered was port Mouton; there,
67
among the fogs which are very common in this sea
during the Summer, he encountered serious dangers,
principally in the neighborhood of Cape Sable, where
his ship came near foundering.
History of New France, book 2, chap. 37, p. 527.Thence, in trying
to reach Port Royal, he was carried by violent winds
forty leagues beyond, namely to the Norombega
river,11 so celebrated and so fabulously described by
Geographers and Historians, as I have shown in my
said History, where this voyage may be seen in the
geographical Chart [14] which I have inserted therein.
Thence he came to the river saint John, which is
opposite Port Royal beyond French Bay,12 where he
found a ship from St. Malo trading with the Savages
of the country. Here complaint was made to him by
a Captain of the Savages, that one of the crew of
the said ship had stolen away his wife and was abusing
her: the Sieur informed himself about the matter and
then made a prisoner of the malefactor and seized
the ship.13 But he released the ship and the sailors,
contenting himself by retaining the guilty one, who
escaped, however, in a shallop, and went off with the
Savages, prejudicing them against the French, as we
shall relate hereafter. Arrived at last at Port Royal,
it is impossible to describe the joy with which these
poor people received the Sieur and his company.
And, in truth, there was still greater reason for this
joy, since they had lost all hope of ever again seeing
the French live among them. They had had some
experience of our kind treatment while we were
there, and, seeing themselves deprived of it, they
wept bitterly when we left them three years ago.

This Port Royal, the home [15] of sieur de Poutrincourt,
is the most beautiful earthly habitation that God
has ever made. It is fortified upon the North by a
69
range of 12 or 15 leagues of mountains, upon which
the Sun beats all day, and by hills on the Southern
or Meridian shore, which forms a port that can securely
harbor twenty thousand ships, being twenty
fathoms deep at its entrance, a league and a half in
width, and four leagues long, extending to an island
which is a French league in circumference: here I
have sometimes seen swimming at ease a medium-sized
Whale, which came in with the tide at eight
o'clock every morning. Furthermore, there can be
caught in this port, in their season, great quantities
of herring, smelt, sardines, barbels, codfish, seals and
other fish; and as to shell-fish, there is an abundance
of lobsters, crabs, palourdes,14 cockles, mussels, snails,
and porpoises. But whoever is disposed to go beyond
the tides of the sea will find in the river quantities
of sturgeon and salmon, and will have plenty of
sport in landing them. Now, to return to our story;
When Sieur de Poutrincourt arrived [6 i.e. 16] there,
he found his buildings entire, the Savages (as these
people have been called up to the present) not having
touched them in any way, even the furniture remaining
as we had left it. Anxious about their old
friends, they asked how they were all getting along,
calling each individual by his name, and asking why
such and such a one had not come back. This shows
the great amiability of these people, who, having
seen in us only the most humane qualities, never flee
from us, as they do from the Spaniard in this whole
new world. And consequently by a certain gentleness
and courtesy, which are as well known to them
as to us, it is easy to make them pliant to all our
wishes, and especially so in regard to Religion, of
which we left them some good impressions when we
71
were there; and they seemed to wish for nothing better
than to enroll themselves under the banner of
Jesus Christ, where they would have been received
at once if we had had a firm foothold in the country.
But just as we were hoping to continue [17] the work,
it happened that sieur de Monts, being unable longer
to meet the expenses, and not receiving any help
from the King, was obliged to recall all those who
were over there, who had not taken with them the
means necessary to a longer sojourn. So it would
have been rash and unwise to administer baptism to
people whom it was necessary afterwards to abandon,
and give them an opportunity to return to their corruption.
But now that the work is being carried on
in earnest, and as sieur de Poutrincourt has actually
settled there, it is lawful to impress upon their minds
and souls the stamp of Christianity, after having
instructed them in the principal articles of our Faith.
Hebrews 11, vers. 6.Sieur de Poutrincourt is careful to do this, remembering
what the Apostle said, He that cometh to God,
must believe that he is; and after believing this, one
comes gradually to ideas which are farther removed
from mere sensual apprehension, such as the belief
that out of nothing God created all things, that he
made himself man, that he was born of a Virgin,
that he consented to die for man, etc. And inasmuch
as the Ecclesiastics who have been taken over
there, are not [18] familiar with the language of these
people, the Sieur has taken the trouble to teach them
and to have them taught by his eldest son, a young
Gentleman who understands and speaks the native
language very well, and who seems to have been
destined to open up to the Savages the way to
heaven. The people who are at Port Royal, and in73
the adjacent countries extending toward Newfoundland,
are called Souriquois15 and have a language of
their own. But beyond French Bay, which extends
into the land about forty leagues, and is ten or twelve
leagues wide, the people on the other side are called
Etechemins; and still farther away are the Armouchiquois,
whose language is different from that of the
Etechemins, and who are fortunate in having an
abundance of vines and large grapes, if they only
knew how to make use of this fruit, which they
believe (as did our ancient Gauls) to be poisonous.
Ammianus Marcellinus.They also have excellent hemp, which grows wild,
and in quality and appearance is much superior to
ours. Besides this they have Sassafras, and a great
abundance of oak, walnut, plum and chestnut trees,
and other fruits which are unknown to us. As to
Port Royal, I must confess that there is not [19] much
fruit there; and yet the land is productive enough to
make us hope from it all that Gallic France yields to
us. All these tribes are governed by Captains called
Sagamores, a word used with the same signification
in the East Indies, as I have read in the History by
Maffeus,16 and which I believe comes from the Hebrew
word Sagan, which, according to Rabbi David,
means Great Prince, and sometimes means the one
who holds the second place after the sovereign Pontiff.
Isaiah 41, vers. 25, Jerem. 51, vers. 23, Santes Pagnin, 9.In the usual version of the Bible it is defined
"Magistrate," and yet even there the Hebrew interpreters
translate it by the word "Prince." And in
fact we read in Berosus17 that Noah was called Saga,
as much because he was a great Prince as because he
had taught Theology and the ceremonies of divine
service, and also many of the secrets of nature, to
the Armenian Scythians, whom the ancient Cosmog75raphers
called "Sages," after Noah. And perhaps for
this very same reason our Tectosages, who are the
Tolosains,18 are so called. For this good father, who
restored the world, came into Italy and sent [20] a
new population into Gaul after the Deluge, giving his
name, Gauls (for Xenophon says that he was also called
by this name), to those whom he sent there, because
he had escaped from the waters. And it is not improbable
that he himself imposed this name upon the
Tectosages. Let us return to our word Sagamore,
which is the title of honor given to the Captains in
these new Lands, of which we are speaking. At Port
Royal, the name of the Captain or Sagamore of the
place is Membertou.19 He is at least a hundred years
old, and may in the course of nature live more than
fifty years longer. He has under him a number of
families whom he rules, not with so much authority
as does our King over his subjects, but with sufficient
power to harangue, advise, and lead them to war, to
render justice to one who has a grievance, and like
matters. He does not impose taxes upon the people,
but if there are any profits from the chase he has a
share of them, without being obliged to take part in
it. It is true that they sometimes make him presents of
Beaver skins and other things, when he is occupied in
curing the sick; or in questioning [21] his demon (whom
he calls Aoutem) to have news of some future event or
of the absent: for, as each village, or company of
Savages, has an Aoutmoin, or Prophet, who performs
this office, Membertou is the one who, from time
immemorial, has practiced this art among his followers.
He has done it so well that his reputation is far
above that of all the other Sagamores of the country,
he having been since his youth a great Captain, and77
also having exercised the offices of Soothsayer and
Medicine-man, which are the three things most efficacious
to the well-being of man, and necessary to this
human life. Now this Membertou to-day, by the grace
of God, is a Christian, together with all his family,
having been baptized, and twenty others with him, on
last saint John's day, the 24th of June. I have
letters from Sieur de Poutrincourt about it, dated the
eleventh day of July following. He said Membertou
was named after our late good King Henri IV., and
his eldest son after Monseigneur the Dauphin, to-day
our King Louis XIII., whom may God bless. And so,
as a natural consequence, the wife of Membertou [22]
was named Marie after the Queen Regent, and her
daughter received the name of the Queen, Marguerite.
The second son of Membertou, called Actaudin,
was named Paul after our holy Father, the Pope of
Rome. The daughter of the aforesaid Louis was
named Christine in honor of Madame, the eldest
sister of the King. And thus to each one was given
the name of some illustrious or notable personage
here in France. A number of other Savages were
about to camp elsewhere (as it is their custom to
scatter in bands when summer comes) at the time of
these ceremonies of Christian regeneration, whom we
believe to be to-day enrolled in the family of God by
the same cleansing water of holy baptism.20
But the
devil, who never sleeps, has shown the jealousy
which he felt at the salvation of these people, and at
seeing that the name of God was glorified in this
land, by inciting a wicked Frenchman, not a Frenchman
but a Turk, not a Turk but an Atheist, to divert
from the path of righteousness several Savages who
had been Christians in their hearts and [23] souls for79
three years; and among others a Sagamore named
Chkoudun, a man of great influence, of whom I have
made honorable mention in my History of New
France, because I saw that he, more than all the
others, loved the French, and that he admired our
civilization more than their ignorance: to such an extent,
that being present sometimes at the Christian
admonitions, which were given every Sunday to our
French people, he listened attentively, although he
did not understand a word; and moreover wore the
sign of the Cross upon his bosom, which he also had
his servants wear; and he had in imitation of us, a
great Cross erected in the public place of his village,
called Oigoudi, at the port of the river saint John,
ten leagues from Port Royal. Now this man, with
others, was turned away from Christianity, by the
cursed avarice of this wicked Frenchman to whom I
have referred above, and whom I do not wish to
name now on account of the love and reverence I
bear his father, but I protest that I will immortalize
him if he does not mend his ways. He, I say, in
order to defraud this Sagamore [24], Chkoudun, of a
few Beavers, went last June to bribe him, after having
escaped from the hands of Sieur de Poutrincourt, saying
that all this Poutrincourt told them about God
was nonsense, that they need not believe it, that he
was an impostor, that he would kill them and get
their Beavers. I omit a great many wicked stories
that he may have added to this. If he were of the
religious belief of those who call themselves Reformed,
I might somewhat excuse him. But he
plainly shows that he is neither of the one nor the
other. But I will say, however, that he has reason to
thank God for his escape from imminent peril on our
81
voyage. This Sagamore, being a Christian, by his
good example might have caused a great number of
others to become Christians. But I am willing to
hope, or rather firmly believe, that he will not remain
much longer in this error, and that the Sieur will
have found some means of attracting him with many
others to himself, to impress upon him the vital
truths with which he had formerly, in my presence,
touched his soul. For the spirit of God has power to
drop upon this field fresh dew, which will bring forth
a new germination where all has been laid waste and
beaten down by the hail. May God, by his grace,
guide all in such a way that it will redound to his
glory and to the edification of this people, for whom
all Christians ought to make continual supplication
to his divine goodness, to the end that he may consent
to confirm and advance the work, which he has
been pleased to begin at this time for the exaltation
of his name and for the salvation of his creatures.21

END.

[25] There are in that country some men of the
Church, of good scholarship, whom nothing but their
religious zeal has taken there, and who will not fail to
do all that piety requires in this respect. Now, for the
present, there is no need of any learned Doctors who
may be more useful in combating vices and heresies
at home. Besides, there is a certain class of men in
whom we cannot have complete confidence, who are
in the habit of censuring everything that is not in
harmony with their maxims, and wish to rule wherever
they are. It is enough to be watched from
abroad without having these fault-finders, from whom
even the greatest Kings cannot defend themselves,83
come near enough to record every movement of our
hearts and souls. And then what would be the use
of so many such men over there at present, unless
they wanted to devote themselves to the cultivation
of the soil? For going there is not all. What they
will do, when they get there, must be taken into consideration.
As to Sieur de Poutrincourt's residence,
he provided himself at his departure with everything
that was necessary. But if a few honest people were
seized with a desire to [26] advance the cause of the
Gospel there, I would advise them to make up five or
six parties, each one having a well-equipped ship, and
to go and establish colonies in different parts of New
France, as at Tadoussac, Gachep√©, Campseau, la H√©ve,
Oigoudi, Ste. Croix, Pemptegoet, Kinibeki, and in
other places, where there are assemblages of Savages,
whom time must lead to the Christian Religion: unless
the head of some great family, like the King,
wishes to have the sole glory of peopling these lands.
For to think of living as the Savages do seems to me
out of all reason. And to prove this, the following
is an example of their way of living:
Manner of living of the Souriquois and Ethechemins.From the first
land (which is Newfoundland) to the country of the
Armouchiquois, a distance of nearly three hundred
leagues, the people are nomads, without agriculture,
never stopping longer than five or six weeks in a
place. Pliny mentions a certain people called
Ichthyophagi, i.e., Fish-eaters, living in the same
way. These Savages get their living in this manner
during three seasons of the year. For, when Spring
comes, they divide into bands upon the shores of the
sea, until [27] Winter; and then as the fish withdraw
to the bottom of the great salt waters, they seek the
lakes and the shades of the forests, where they catch
85
Beavers, upon which they live, and other game, as
Elk, Caribou, Deer, and still smaller animals. And
yet, sometimes even in Summer, they do not give up
hunting: besides, there are an infinite number of
birds on certain islands in the months of May, June,
July and August.
Their beds.As to their beds, a skin spread
out upon the ground serves as mattress. And in this
we have nothing to jest about, for our old Gallic ancestors
did the same thing, and even dined from the
skins of dogs and wolves, if Diodorus and Strabo tell
the truth.
Armouchiquois.But as to the Armouchiquois and Iroquois
countries, there is a greater harvest to be gathered
there by those who are inspired by religious zeal, because
they are not so sparsely populated, and the
people cultivate the soil, from which they derive
some of the comforts of life. It is true that they do
not understand very well how to make bread, not
having mills, yeast, or ovens; so they pound their
corn in a kind of [28] mortar, and make a paste of it as
best they can, and bake it between two stones heated
at the fire; or they roast this corn on the ear upon
the live coals, as did the old Romans, according to
Pliny.
Pliny, book 18, chap. 2 and 10.Afterwards people learned to bake cakes under
the embers; and still later bakers began to make
use of ovens. Now these people who cultivate the
soil are stationary, not like the others who have nothing
of their own, just as the Germans in the time of
Tacitus, who has described their ancient way of
living.
Iroquois.Farther inland, and beyond the Armouchiquois,
are the Iroquois tribes, also stationary, because
they till the soil, whence they gather maize wheat
(or Buckwheat), beans, edible roots, and in short all
that we have mentioned in describing the Armouchiquois,
even more, for from necessity they draw their87
sustenance from the earth, as they are far from the sea.
However, they have a great lake in their country, of
wonderful extent, perhaps about sixty leagues, around
which they encamp. New Mexico.In this lake there are large and
beautiful islands inhabited by the Iroquois, who are
a great people; the farther [29] we penetrate into the
country, the more we find it inhabited: so much so
that (if we can believe the Spaniards) in the country
called New Mexico, a long distance to the Southwest
of these Iroquois, there are regularly built cities and
houses of three and four stories, and even domesticated
cattle, whence they have named a certain river,
Rio de las Vaccas, or Cow river, because they saw a
large number of them grazing on its banks.
A great lake beyond Canada.And
this country is more than five hundred leagues directly
to the north of old Mexico, being near, I believe,
the end of the great lake of the river of Canada
which (according to the Savages) is a thirty days'
journey in length. I believe that robust and hardy
men could live among these people, and do great
work for the advancement of the Christian Religion.
But as to the Souriquois and Etechemins, who are
nomadic and divided, they must be made sedentary
by the cultivation of the land, thus obliging them to
remain in one place. For any one who has taken the
trouble to cultivate a piece of land does not readily
abandon it, but struggles valiantly to keep it. [30] But,
I think, the execution of this plan will be very slow
unless we take hold of it with more zeal, and unless a
King, or some rich Prince, take this cause in hand,
which is certainly worthy a most Christian kingdom.
Conquest of Palestine compared with that of New France.Great expense and loss of life were once incurred in
the re-conquest of Palestine, from which there was little
profit; and to-day at slight expense wonders could
89
be accomplished, and an infinite number of people
won over to God, without striking a blow: and yet
we are touched by an inexplicable apathy in religious
matters, which is quite different from the fervid zeal,
which of old burned in the bosoms of our fathers. If
we did not expect any temporal fruit from these
labors, I would pardon this human weakness. But
there are such well-founded hopes of good usury,
that they close the mouths of all the enemies of that
country, who decry it in order not to lose the traffic
in Beaver and other furs from which they gain a
livelihood, and without which they would die of
starvation or would not know what to do.
Appeal to the King and the Queen Regent.But if the
King and the Queen Regent, his mother, in whom God
has kindled a fire of piety, should be pleased to take an
interest in this (as she has certainly done in the report
of the Conversion of the Savages, baptized through
the [31] instrumentality of Sieur de Poutrincourt)
and would leave some memorial of herself, or rather
would secure for herself the blessedness of heaven by
this most godly act, no one can tell how great would
be her future glory in being the first to establish the
Gospel in such vast territories, which (so to speak)
have no bounds. If Helena, the mother of the Emperor
Constantine, had found such a field for good
work, she would have greatly preferred to glorify
God with living temples, instead of building so many
marble edifices, with which she has filled the holy
land. And, after all, the hope of temporal profit is
not vain. For on one hand Sieur de Poutrincourt
will continue to be the servant of the King in the
country which his Majesty has granted him; where
he would afford a rendezvous and give assistance to
all the vessels which go every year to the new91
World, where they encounter a thousand hardships
and, as we have seen and heard, great numbers of
them are lost.
Means of reaching the Moluccas through the Northern route.On the other hand, penetrating into
the country, we might become familiar with the route
to China and the Moluccas, through a mild climate
and latitude, establishing a few stations, or [32] settlements,
at the Falls of the great Canadian river, then
at the lakes which are beyond, the last of which is
not far from the great Western sea, through which
the Spaniards to-day reach the Orient. Or, indeed,
the same enterprise could be carried on through the
Saguenay river, beyond which the Savages say there
is a sea of which they have never seen the end, which
is without doubt that Northern passage that has been
so long sought in vain.
Advantages.So that we could have spices
and other drugs without begging them from the
Spaniards, and the profits derived from us upon these
commodities would remain in the hands of the King,
not counting the advantages of having hides, pasturage,
fisheries, and other sources of wealth. But we
must sow before we can reap. In this work we could
give employment to many of the youth of France, a
part of whom languish in poverty or in idleness:
while others go to foreign countries to teach the
trades which in former times belonged strictly and
peculiarly to us, and by means of which France was
filled with prosperity; whereas, to-day, a long period
of peace has not yet been able to restore to her her
former glory, as much [33] for the reasons just given,
as for the number of idle men, and of able-bodied and
voluntary mendicants, whom the public supports.
Chicanery.Among these obstacles we may place also the evil of
chicanery, which preys upon our nation, and which
has always been a reproach to it. Ammianus
Marcellinus.This would be93
somewhat obviated by frequent voyages; for a part
of these pettifoggers would sooner conquer some new
land, remaining under the dominion of the King, than
follow up their cause here with so much loss, delay,
anxiety, and labor.
Happiness
of the
Savages.And, in this respect, I consider
all these poor savages, whom we commiserate, to be
very happy; for pale Envy doth not emaciate them,
neither do they feel the inhumanity of those who
serve God hypocritically, harassing their fellow-creatures
under this mask; nor are they subject to the
artifices of those who, lacking virtue and goodness
wrap themselves up in a mantle of false piety to
nourish their ambition. If they do not know God,
at least they do not blaspheme him, as the greater
number of Christians do. Nor do they understand
the art of poisoning, or of corrupting [34] chastity by
devilish artifice. There are no poor nor beggars
among them. All are rich, because all labor and
live. But among us it is very different, for more
than half of us live from the labors of the others,
having no trades which serve to the support of human
life.
Opportunities
for
emigrants
to New
France.If that country were settled, there are men who
would do there what they have not courage to do
here. Here they would not dare to be wood-cutters,
husbandmen, vinedressers, etc., because their fathers
were pettifoggers, barber-surgeons, and apothecaries.
But over yonder they would forget their fear of being
ridiculed, and would take pleasure in cultivating
their land, having a great many companions of as
good families as theirs. Cultivating the soil is the
most innocent of occupations and the most sure; it
was the occupation of those from whom we have all
descended, and of those brave Roman Captains who
knew how to subjugate, but not how to be subjugated.95
But now, since pomp and malice have been introduced
among men, what was virtue has been turned into
reproach, and idlers have risen into favor.
To the
Queen.However,
let us leave these people, and return to Sieur de Poutrincourt,
or rather to you, O most Christian Queen,
[35] the greatest and most cherished of heaven,
whom the eye of the world looks down upon in its
daily round about this universe. You who have the
control of the most noble Empire here below, how
can you see a Gentleman so full of good will, without
employing and helping him? Will you let him carry
off the greatest honor in the world when it might
have been yours, and will you let the triumph of this
affair remain with him and not share in it yourself?
No, no, Madame, all must proceed from you, and as
the stars borrow their light from the sun, so upon
the King, and upon you who have given him to us, all
the great deeds of the French depend. We must then
anticipate this glory, and not yield it to another,
while you have a Poutrincourt, a loyal Frenchman who
served the late lamented King, your Husband (may
God give him absolution), in affairs of State which
are not recorded in history. In revenge for which
his house and property passed through the ordeal of
fire. He is not crossing the Ocean to see the country,
as have nearly all the others who have undertaken
similar voyages [36] at the expense of our Kings.
But he shows so plainly what his intentions are, that
we cannot doubt them, and your Majesty will risk
nothing by employing him in earnest for the propagation
of the Christian religion in the Western lands
beyond the sea. You recognize his zeal, your own
is incomparable; but you must take thought as to
how you may best employ it. I commend the Prin97cesses
and Ladies who for fifteen years have given of
their means for the repose of those men or women
who wished to sequester themselves from the world.
But I believe (under correction) that their piety would
shine with greater luster if it were shown in behalf
of these poor Western nations, who are in a lamentable
condition, and whose lack of instruction cries to
God for vengeance against those who might help
them to become Christians, and will not. A Queen
of Castille caused the Christian religion to be introduced
into the lands of the West which belong to
Spain; so act, O light of the Queens of the world,
that through your instrumentality, the name of God
may soon be proclaimed throughout all this new
world; where it is not yet known. Now resuming the
thread of our [37] History, as we have spoken of the
voyage of Sieur de Poutrincourt, it will not be out
of place, if, after having touched upon the hardships
and tediousness of his journey, which retarded him
one year, we say a word about the return of his ship,
which will be brief, inasmuch as the voyages from
the Western world, this side of the Tropic of Cancer,
are usually so.
Book 1,
ch. 24,
and book 2,
ch. 41 and 42.I have given the reason for this in
my History of New France, to which I refer the
Reader, where he will also learn why it is that in
Summer the sea there is overhung with fogs to such
an extent that for one clear day there are two foggy
ones; and twice we were in fogs which lasted eight
entire days.
For these
Banks, see
the said
History,
book 2,
ch. 24.This is why Sieur de Poutrincourt's
son, when he was sent back to France for fresh supplies,
was as long in reaching the great Codfish
Banks from Port Royal, as in getting to France from
the said Banks; and yet from these Banks to the coast
of France there are eight hundred good leagues; and99
thence to Port Royal there are hardly [38] more than
three hundred. It is upon these Banks that a great
many ships are usually found all the Summer, fishing
for Cod, which are brought to France and are called
Newfoundland Codfish.
For their
manner of
fishing, see
the above-mentioned
place.So Sieur de Poutrincourt's
son (who is called Baron de Sainct Just), on arriving
at these Banks, laid in a supply of fresh meat and
fish. While doing this he met a ship from Rochelle
and another from Havre de Grace, whence he heard
the news of the lamentable death of our late good
King, without knowing by whom or how he was
killed. But afterwards he met an English ship from
which he heard the same thing, certain persons being
accused of this parricide whom I will not here name;
for they brought this accusation through hatred and
envy, being great enemies of those whom they accused.
In 15 days
from the
Banks to
France.So in fifteen days Baron de Sainct Just made
the distance between the Banks and France, always
sailing before the wind; a voyage certainly much
more agreeable than that of the twenty-sixth day of
February mentioned above. Sieur de Monts's crew left
Havre de Grace nine or ten days after this twenty-sixth
of February to go to Kebec, forty leagues beyond [39]
the Saguenay river, where Sieur de Monts has fortified
himself. But contrary winds compelled them to
put into port. And thereupon a report was circulated
that Sieur de Poutrincourt was lost in the sea
with all his crew. I did not believe this for an instant,
trusting that God would help him and would
enable him to surmount all difficulties.
Kebec,
Sieur de
Monts's
fort.We have as
yet no news from Kebec, but expect to hear from
there soon. I can say truly that if ever any good
comes out of New France, posterity will be indebted
for it to Sieur de Monts, author of these enterprises:101
and if they had not taken away the license which was
granted him to trade in Beaver and other skins,
to-day we should have had a vast number of cattle,
fruit-trees, people, and buildings in the said province.
For he earnestly desired to see everything established
there to the honor of God and of France. And,
although he has been deprived of the motive for continuing,
yet up to the present he does not seem discouraged
in doing what he can; for he has had built
at Kebec a Fort and some very good and convenient
dwellings. Here at Kebec this [40] great and mighty
river of Canada narrows down and is only a falcon-shot
wide; it has as great a supply of fish as any
river in the world. As to the country, it is wonderfully
beautiful, and abounds in game. But being in a
colder region than port Royal, since it is eighty
leagues farther North, the fur there is all the finer.
For (among other animals) the Foxes are black and of
such beautiful fur that they seem to put the Martens
to shame. The Savages of Port Royal can go to
Kebec in ten or twelve days by means of the rivers,
which they navigate almost up to their sources; and
thence, carrying their little bark canoes for some
distance through the woods, they reach another
stream which flows into the river of Canada, and thus
greatly expedite their long voyages, which we ourselves
could not do in the present state of the country.
And from Port Royal to Kebec by sea it is more
than four hundred leagues, going by way of Cape
Breton. Sieur de Monts sent some cows there two
years and a half ago, but for want of some village
housewife who understood [41] taking care of them,
they let the greater part die in giving birth to their
calves.
The need of
women.Which shows how necessary a woman is in103
a house, and I cannot understand why so many
people slight them, although they cannot do without
them. For my part, I shall always believe that, in
any settlement whatsoever, nothing will be accomplished
without the presence of women. Without
them life is sad, sickness comes, and we die uncared-for.
Therefore I despise those woman-haters who
have wished them all sorts of evil, which I hope
will overtake that lunatic in particular, who has been
placed among the number of the seven Sages, who
said that woman is a necessary evil, since there is no
blessing in the world to be compared to her.
Ecclesiastes
4, verse 10.Therefore
God gave her as a companion to man, to aid and
comfort him: and the Wise Man says:&mdash;Woe to him
that is alone, for when he falleth, he hath none to lift
him up. And if two lie together, they shall warm one
another. If there are some worthless women, we
must remember that men are not faultless. Several
suffered because of this lack of cows, for, when they
fell ill they did not have all the comforts [42] that
they would have had otherwise, and so they have
departed to the Elysian fields.
A conspiracy
punished.Another, who had
been with us on the voyage, did not have the patience
to wait for death, but must needs go to
heaven by scaling the walls, as soon as he arrived
there, by a conspiracy against sieur de Champlein,
his Captain. His accomplices were condemned to
the galleys and sent back to France.
Journey to
the land
of the
Iroquois.When Summer
came, that is a year ago, Champlein wishing
to see the country of the Iroquois, to prevent the
Savages from seizing his Fort in his absence, persuaded
them to go and make war against them; so
they departed with him and two other Frenchmen,
to the number of eighty or a hundred, to the lake of
105
the Iroquois, two hundred leagues distant from
Kebec.
Hostile
nations.There has always been war between these
two nations, as there has been between the Souriquois
and Armouchiquois: and sometimes the Iroquois
have raised as many as eight thousand men
to war against and exterminate all those who live
near the great river of Canada: and it seems that
they did this, as to-day the language which was spoken
in the [43] time of Jacques Quartier, who was there
eighty years ago, is no longer heard in that region.22
War.When Champlein arrived there with his troops, they
could not conceal themselves so well but that they
were perceived by the Iroquois, who always have
sentinels upon the routes of their enemies: and each
side being well fortified, it was agreed among them
not to fight that day, but to postpone the affair until
the morrow. The weather then was very clear; so
clear that scarcely had Aurora chased away the shadows
of the night, than a din was heard throughout
the camp. An Iroquois skirmisher having tried to
issue from the fortifications, was pierced through,
not by one of the arrows of Apollo, nor of the little
Archer with the blindfolded eyes, but by a genuine
and very painful arrow, which stretched him out
upon his back. Thereupon the eyes of the offended
were full of ire, and each one takes his place in the
line of attack and defense. As the band of Iroquois
advances, Champlein, who had charged his musket
with two balls, seeing two Iroquois, their heads
adorned with feathers, marching on in front, supposed
they were two Captains, and wanted to advance
[44] and aim at them. But the Kebec Savages
prevented him, saying:&mdash;"It is not well that they
should see thee, for, never having been accustomed
107
to see such people as thou art, they would immediately
run away. But withdraw behind our first
rank, and when we are ready, thou shalt advance."
He did so, and in this way the two Captains were both
slain by one musket shot.
Victory.Victory ensued at once.
For they all disbanded, and it only remained to pursue
them.
Tabagie is
celebrated.This was done with little opposition, and
they carried off some fifty of their enemies' heads, a
triumph which, upon their return, they celebrated
with great festivities, consisting of continual Tabagies,23
dances, and chants, according to their custom.24

A LETTER MISSIVE
IN REGARD TO THE
Conversion and Baptism
of the grand Sagamore of New
France, who was, before the arrival
of the French, its chief
and sovereign.

Containing his promise to secure the conversion
of his subjects also, even by

[3] A Letter Missive in regard to the Conversion121
and Baptism of the Grand Sagamore of new
France, who was, before the arrival of
the French, its chief and sovereign.

SIR and Brother, I did not wish the ship to depart
without giving you some news of this
country which I believe will be acceptable,
as I know that you are a good Catholic. The Grand
Sagamore, whom we call in our language Grand Captain
of the Savages, and chief of all, was baptized
on last saint John the Baptist's day; [4] with his wife,
children, and children's children, to the number
of twenty; with as much enthusiasm, fervor, and zeal
for Religion as would have been evinced by a person
who had been instructed in it for three or four
years. He promises to have the others baptized,
or else make war upon them.
The news of
the King's
death had
not then
reached
Canada.Monsieur de Poutrincourt
and his son acted as sponsors for them in
the name of the King, and of Monseigneur the
Dauphin. We have already made this good beginning,
which I believe will become still better hereafter.
As to the country, I have never seen anything
so beautiful, better, or more fertile; and I can say
to you, truly and honestly, that if I had three or four
Laborers with me now, and [5] the means of supporting
them for one year, and some wheat to sow in the
ground tilled by their labor alone, I should expect to
have a yearly trade in Beaver and other Skins amounting
to seven or eight thousand livres, with the sur
123plus
which would remain to me after their support.
I am very sorry that I did not know before my departure
what I know now; if I had, I should have
left no stone unturned to bring with me two or three
farmers, and two hogsheads of wheat, which is a mere
trifle. I assure you it is delightful to engage in trade
over here and to make such handsome profits. If you
wish to take a hand in it, let me know your intentions
by the bearer, who desires to return and traffic here
in pursuance of what he has seen. I [6] shall say no
more, except to pray God to give you, Sir and
Brother, a long life and perfect health. From Port
Royal, New France, this 28th of June, 1610.


Your very affectionate Brother and servant,

Bertrand.

[1] PREMI√àRE MISSION DES J√âSUITES
AU CANADA.[I.]

Lettre du P. Pierre Biard, au T. R. P. Claude Aquaviva,
G√©n√©ral de la Compagnie
de J√©sus, √† Rome.

(Traduite sur l'original latin, conserv√© dans les
Archives du J√©sus, √† Rome).


Dieppe, 21 janvier 1611.

Mon Tr√®s-r√©v√©rend P√®re,

Pax Christi.


Que je voudrais pouvoir vous raconter combien
grandes et nombreuses ont √©t√©, dans notre petite
affaire, les mis√©ricordes de Dieu et les fruits de
sa b√©n√©diction et des pri√®res; c'est-√†-dire comment
128
[2] nous sommes sortis de difficult√©s graves et multipli√©es,
et comment, d√©livr√©s de toute entrave, nous
partons pour la Nouvelle-France, lieu de notre [3] destination,
130
comme Votre Paternit√© le sait! Elle peut
certainement s'en r√©jouir avec une grande consolation
dans le Seigneur.

[4] Mais voici d√©j√† minuit sonn√©, et √† la premi√®re
lueur du jour, nous mettons √† la voile. Je vous donnerai
seulement un pr√©cis des √©v√©nements.

Quand les marchands h√©r√©tiques nous virent √†
Dieppe, au jour fix√© pour le d√©part, le 27 octobre de
132
l'ann√©e derni√®re, 1610 (nous √©tions en effet convenus
qu'on partirait de Dieppe), ils imagin√®rent un moyen
qu'ils crurent favorable pour nous nuire. Deux
d'entre eux avaient fait un contrat avec M. de Potrincourt
pour charger et √©quiper son navire, [5] sur lequel
nous devions voyager. Ils d√©clar√®rent aussit√¥t
qu'ils ne voulaient plus s'occuper du vaisseau, s'il
devait porter des J√©suites. C'√©tait une insigne malice,
et elle √©tait facile √† prouver, surtout quand les
catholiques leur ajoutaient que le devoir ne leur permettait
pas de refuser les J√©suites, puisque c'√©tait
l'ordre formel de la Reine.

On ne put cependant rien gagner sur eux. Il fallut
avoir encore recours √† la Reine. Sa Majest√©
√©crit au gouverneur de la ville, catholique plein de
z√®le et de pi√©t√©, et lui enjoint de signifier aux h√©r√©tiques
que c'est sa volont√© que les J√©suites soient
re√ßus dans le vaisseau qui va partir pour la Nouvelle-France,
et qu'on n'y mette aucun obstacle.

A la r√©ception de ces lettres, le gouverneur assemble
ce qu'on appelle le consistoire, c'est-√†-dire
tous les fid√®les disciples de Calvin. Il donne lecture
des lettres de la Reine, et les invite √† l'ob√©issance.&mdash;Quelques-uns,
c'est-√†-dire ceux qui √©taient bons,
disent hautement qu'ils sont eux aussi du m√™me avis,
et ils engagent les marchands √† se soumettre; mais
ils d√©clarent que pour eux ils ne sont ma√Ætres de rien.
Tel √©tait leur langage en public; mais en particulier,
un des marchands qui √©tait charg√© d'√©quiper le navire,
protesta qu'il n'y mettrait rien; que la Reine,
si elle le voulait, pouvait lui [6] √¥ter son droit, mais
que pour lui, il ne le c√©derait pas autrement.

Que faire? Certainement tout √©tait arr√™t√©; car
cette soci√©t√© n'avait pas de contrat √©crit, et ces sortes
134
d'engagements entre gens nobles ne se mettent pas
ordinairement sur papier. On ne pouvait donc pas
agir contre ces h√©r√©tiques.

On s'adresse de nouveau √† la Reine. A la vue
d'une pareille effronterie, elle dit en mani√®re de
proverbe: "Il ne faut s'abaisser √† prier des vilains";
et elle ajouta que les P√®res partiraient une autre fois.

Les catholiques constern√©s d√©clarent alors aux h√©r√©tiques
que les J√©suites ne monteront pas dans ce
vaisseau, qu'ils peuvent en cons√©quence le fr√©ter, et
que, dans tous les cas, si les J√©suites y prenaient
place, ils payeraient auparavant eux-m√™mes le prix
de la cargaison.

Cette assurance une fois donn√©e, on vit √† nu toute
la malice des calvinistes; car ils charg√®rent aussit√¥t
le navire compl√©tement et de marchandises et de
toute esp√®ce d'objets, ne pouvant s'imaginer que les
catholiques pussent jamais trouver de quoi payer le
prix de tant de choses.

A cette nouvelle, Madame la marquise de Guercheville,
premi√®re dame d'honneur de la Reine, [7] s'indigna
de voir les efforts de l'enfer pr√©valoir et la
malice des hommes pervers d√©truire ces grandes
esp√©rances que l'on avait de procurer la gloire de
Dieu. C'est pourquoi, afin que Satan ne demeur√¢t
pas le ma√Ætre et ne renvers√¢t pas l'espoir que l'on
avait de fonder une √©glise au Canada, elle sollicita
elle-m√™me les aum√¥nes des Grands, des Princes et de
toute la Cour pour soustraire les J√©suites √† la m√©chancet√©
des h√©r√©tiques.

Qu'arriva-t-il? Le navire d√©j√† charg√© √©tait pr√™t √†
prendre la mer, quand cette dame envoya aux catholiques
4,000 livres avec d'autres secours. Alors,
pour ne pas agir par surprise, ils vont dire adroitement
136
aux h√©r√©tiques qu'ils veulent avoir avec eux les
J√©suites, que telle est la volont√© de la Reine, et que,
par cons√©quent, il faut qu'ils les laissent monter dans
le vaisseau, ou bien que les marchands acceptent le
prix de la cargaison et qu'ils se retirent. Ceux-ci
d√©clarent qu'ils veulent le prix de leurs marchandises
(Je crois qu'ils ne pensaient pas que les catholiques
eussent assez d'argent, ou qu'ils esp√©raient trouver
quelque autre moyen de d√©jouer leurs projets). On
leur donne le prix demand√©, et ce √† quoi personne ne
se serait attendu, nous sommes si pleinement substitu√©s
√† leur place, que la moiti√© du b√¢timent nous appartient,
et que nous avons d√©j√† ce qu'il faut pour
commencer [8] cette fondation que le Seigneur daignera
b√©nir dans sa g√©n√©rosit√© et dans sa bont√©.

Ainsi donc, mon Tr√®s-R√©v√©rend et bon P√®re, Votre
Paternit√© voit combien la malice du d√©mon et de ses
supp√¥ts a tourn√© √† notre avantage. Nous ne demandions
d'abord qu'un petit coin dans ce vaisseau, et √†
prix d'argent; maintenant nous y sommes les ma√Ætres.
Nous allions dans une r√©gion d√©serte, sans grande
esp√©rance d'un secours de longue dur√©e, et nous recevons
d√©j√† le commencement de la fondation. Nous
√©tions forc√©s d'enrichir les h√©r√©tiques d'une partie de
nos aum√¥nes, et maintenant ils renoncent d'eux-m√™mes
√† profiter d'une occasion qui les devait enrichir.

Mais je crois que le grand sujet de leur douleur,
c'est pr√©cis√©ment le triomphe du Seigneur J√©sus; et
fasse le ciel qu'il triomphe toujours! Ainsi soit-il!

Dieppe, le 21 janvier 1611.


De Votre Paternit√©

Le fils en J√©sus-Christ et le serviteur indigne,
Pierre BIARD S. J.


NOTES:



[I.] Nous ajouterons aux lettres de nos premiers missionnaires au
Canada un fragment d'un m√©moire intitul√©: Monumenta Nov√¶
Franci√¶, ab anno 1607, ad annum 1737.&mdash;Insul√¶ Martinic√¶ ab
anno 1678.&mdash;Insul√¶ Cayennensis ab anno 1668.


La traduction du chapitre II de ce manuscrit, conserv√© dans nos
archives de Rome, donnera un ensemble de faits sur la Nouvelle-
[2] France, qui ne se trouve pas dans les lettres que nous publions.


Parmi les gentilshommes qui s'offrirent √† Henri-le-Grand, d'heureuse
m√©moire, pour entreprendre la colonisation de la Nouvelle-France,
√©tait le sieur de Potrincourt. Le roi lui accorda tout ce
qu'il demandait, mais en lui signifiant qu'il aurait √† emmener avec
lui des religieux pris dans notre Compagnie pour les employer,
selon ses ordres, √† procurer le salut des sauvages; que du reste la
d√©pense de cette mission ne serait nullement √† sa charge, mais que
le Tr√©sor royal y pourvoirait.


Le R. P. Pierre Coton, alors confesseur et pr√©dicateur du roi, et
qui √©tait fort estim√© de Sa Majest√©, comme on sait, fut charg√© par
lui de choisir, dans sa Compagnie, des hommes capables, pour
mener √† bien cette p√©rilleuse et sainte entreprise.


Beaucoup de nos religieux s'offrirent pour cette mission lointaine.
Parmi eux on remarquait le P. Pierre Biard, homme dont la vertu
√©galait le talent, et qui occupait alors la chaire de th√©ologie √† Lyon.
Le choix des sup√©rieurs tomba sur lui et sur le P. Ennemond Masse,
dont nous aurons √† parler plus loin.


Ils partirent tous les deux en 1608 pour Bordeaux, o√π ils devaient
s'embarquer, mais il fallut attendre trois ans. Car le gentilhomme,
dont nous avons d√©j√† parl√©, retarda son d√©part; puis ensuite il pr√©texta
la n√©cessit√© de faire un voyage d'essai, afin, disait-il, de pr√©parer
une habitation convenable pour les P√®res. Il fit en effet ce
voyage accompagn√© d'un pr√™tre s√©culier, lequel, se laissant aller √†
un z√®le peu r√©fl√©chi, baptisa une centaine de sauvages, sans les
avoir suffisamment instruits et √©prouv√©s. Plus tard, on s'aper√ßut
que ces pauvres gens n'avaient pas m√™me compris ce qu'ils avaient
re√ßu.


Trois ans apr√®s, de retour de son voyage, le sieur de Potrincourt,
press√© par la reine-m√®re, se chargea de conduire nos P√®res au [3] Canada.
Mais ce ne fut pas sans grandes difficult√©s et beaucoup de souffrances
que nos P√®res arriv√®rent au Port-Royal, sur les c√¥tes de
l'Acadie.


L'ann√©e qui suivit leur arriv√©e, deux autres des N√¥tres all√®rent les
rejoindre: ce furent le P. Quentin et le Fr√®re coadjuteur Gilbert du
Thet. Deux ans de s√©jour √† Port-Royal d√©montr√®rent √† nos P√®res
l'impossibilit√© de fixer l√† le centre de leur mission, soit √† cause de
la difficult√© d'y attirer un grand concours de sauvages, soit √† cause
des tracasseries de ceux qui commandaient. Ils transport√®rent le
si√©ge de leur mission sur un autre point de la m√™me c√¥te, au 45e
degr√© 30 minutes de latitude, et cela sur un d√©cret du roi. Cette
fondation prit le nom de Saint-Sauveur. Ils y √©taient √©tablis depuis
peu de temps, lorsque les anglais, survenant √† l'improviste, s'empar√®rent
du vaisseau fran√ßais, saisirent les lettres-patentes du commandant,
et, par une insigne fourberie, le trait√®rent de pirate. Au
moment de l'attaque, plusieurs fran√ßais furent tu√©s, et parmi eux le
fr√®re Gilbert du Thet, homme remarquable par son courage et sa
pi√©t√©.


Les anglais victorieux, apr√®s avoir pill√© tout √† leur aise, abandonn√®rent
dans une mauvaise barque une partie de fran√ßais, et emmen√®rent
avec eux, en Virginie, les PP. Biard et Quentin. Nos deux
prisonniers s'attendaient √† √™tre condamn√©s √† mort, surtout lorsque,
reconduits √† Port-Royal, ils refus√®rent de faire conna√Ætre la retraite
des fran√ßais qui se tenaient cach√©s dans les environs. Dirig√©s une
seconde fois sur la Virginie, ils y auraient probablement trouv√© la
mort, si la divine Providence n'e√ªt rendu inutiles tous les efforts des
marins anglais pour y aborder. La violence de la temp√™te les rejeta
sur les √Æles A√ßores appartenant aux portugais, et o√π, malgr√© eux, ils
furent oblig√©s de prendre terre.


Les anglais eux-m√™mes furent forc√©s d'admirer la loyaut√© et la
[4] charit√© de nos P√®res qui, en se montrant aux portugais, pouvaient
amener la saisie du navire et faire condamner les anglais,
comme pirates, au dernier supplice. Avant d'entrer dans le port,
ils avaient exig√© de leurs prisonniers la promesse de ne pas les
d√©noncer et de se tenir cach√©s durant tout leur s√©jour aux A√ßores.
Pendant la visite du vaisseau faite par les portugais, les P√®res
rest√®rent √† fond de cale, o√π ils √©chapp√®rent √† tous les regards. Cette
g√©n√©rosit√© et cette fid√©lit√© √† garder la parole donn√©e surprirent
tellement les anglais, qu'ils chang√®rent imm√©diatement de proc√©d√©s
envers leurs captifs et les emmen√®rent directement en Angleterre,
o√π ils firent publiquement leur √©loge.


L'ambassadeur de France, √† la nouvelle de leur arriv√©e, se h√¢ta de
les r√©clamer et les fit reconduire honorablement dans leur patrie, au
mois de mai 1614.


Ce premier voyage de nos missionnaires, si st√©rile en apparence,
eut cependant d'heureux r√©sultats. Outre l'exp√©rience acquise et
dont on profita, le z√®le des catholiques fran√ßais, ranim√© par les
paroles des P√®res, cr√©a de nouvelles ressources, et d√®s que la colonie
fran√ßaise fut d√©livr√©e des anglais, les J√©suites reprirent la route du
Canada, o√π ils fond√®rent enfin une des plus belles missions de la
Compagnie.




127
[1] FIRST MISSION OF THE JESUITS
IN CANADA.[II.]
26

Letter from Father Pierre Biard,27 to the Very Reverend
Father Claude Aquaviva,28 General
of the Society of Jesus, Rome.

(Translated from the Latin original, preserved in the
Archives of Jesus, at Rome.)


Dieppe, January 21st, 1611.29

My Very Reverend Father,

The peace of Christ be with you.


Would that I could recount how great and
numerous have been the mercies of God, the fruits of
his blessing and, of our prayers in this our little enterprise;
that is to say, how [2] we have emerged from
129
grave and multiplied difficulties, and how, delivered
from every obstacle, we depart for New France, the
place to which we [3] are bound, as Your Reverence
131
knows. For this you may rejoice with great consolation
in the name of the Lord.

[4] But it has already struck midnight, and we are to
sail at break of day, so I shall give you only a summary
of the events which have taken place.

When the heretic merchants saw us at Dieppe,
upon the day fixed for our departure, the 27th of
October of last year, 1610 (we had, in fact, agreed to
133
sail from Dieppe), they contrived a plan which they
considered capable of injuring us. Two of them31
had made a contract with Monsieur de Potrincourt to
load and equip his ship, [5] in which we were to make
the voyage. They straightway declared that they
would have nothing more to do with the vessel, if it
were going to carry any Jesuits. It was a remarkable
exhibition of malice, as was easy to prove,
especially when the catholics informed them that
they were in duty bound not to reject the Jesuits,
since it was the formal order of the Queen.32

However, nothing could be gained from them, and
the Catholics were again obliged to have recourse to
the Queen. Her Majesty writes to the governor of
the city, a zealous and pious catholic, and charges
him to inform the heretics that it is her will that the
Jesuits be received in the ship which is about to depart
for New France, and that no obstacle be put in
their way.

When these letters are received, the governor assembles
what is called the consistory, namely, all
faithful disciples of Calvin. He reads the Queen's
letters and urges them to be obedient. Some of them,
namely, those who were well disposed toward us,
boldly declare that they also are of the same opinion;
and they try to induce the merchants to yield. But
they declare that for their part they are not the masters.
At least they say this in public; but in private
one of the merchants who was charged with fitting
out the vessel, protested that he would put nothing
into it; that the Queen, if she wished, could deprive
him [6] of his right, but that he certainly would not
yield it otherwise.

What was to be done? In truth, all proceedings
135
were at a standstill; for this society had no written
contract, since agreements of this kind among noblemen
are not usually put upon paper. Therefore they
could not prosecute these heretics.

They address themselves anew to the Queen. In
the presence of such effrontery she quoted the words
of the proverb: "Never stoop to entreat a churl,"
and added that the Fathers should go another time.

The dismayed catholics then declare to the heretics
that the Jesuits will not embark upon their vessel,
and that consequently they may go on freighting it;
and that, in any event, if the Jesuits did occupy a place
therein, they themselves would first pay the price of
the cargo.

This assurance once given, the malice of these
calvinists was exposed in all its nakedness; for they
immediately loaded every part of the ship not only
with merchandise, but with all kinds of goods, never
dreaming that the catholics would be able to find the
means of paying for all these things.

At this news, the marchioness de Guercheville, first
lady of honor to the Queen, [7] was indignant at seeing
the forces of hell prevail, and the malice of wicked
men destroy one's strong hopes of securing the glory
of God.33 Therefore, in order to prevent the triumph
of Satan and the overthrow of their hopes of founding
a church in Canada, she herself solicited alms from
Nobles, Princes, and from all the Court, to rescue the
Jesuits from the malevolence of the heretics.

What happened? The ship, already loaded, was
about to sail, when this lady sent to the catholics
4,000 livres, with other means of assistance. Then,
not to be underhand, they go directly to the heretics
and say that they want the Jesuits to go with them,
137
that such is the will of the Queen; and so consequently
they must allow them to embark, or else the
merchants must accept the price of the cargo and
withdraw. The latter declare that they want the
value of their merchandise. (I believe they did not
think the catholics would have enough money, or
else they hoped to baffle them by some other means.)
They give them the price they asked; and, what no
one could have expected, we so completely take their
place, that half the ship belongs to us, and we have
already means enough to begin [8] laying the foundation,
which the Lord, in his generosity and goodness,
will condescend to bless.

So now, my Very Reverend and good Father, you
see how entirely the malice of the evil one and of his
tools has been turned to our advantage. At first we
only asked a little corner in this vessel at their price.
Now we are masters of it. We were going into a
dreary wilderness, without much hope of permanent
help; and we have already received enough to begin
laying the foundation. We were to enrich the heretics
by a portion of our alms; and now they, of their
own accord, refuse to profit by an occasion which was
to benefit them.

But I believe that the great source of their grief,
is nothing else than the triumph of the Lord Jesus;
and may heaven grant that he always triumph!
Amen!

Dieppe, January 21, 1611.


Of Your Reverence,

The son and unworthy servant in Jesus Christ,
Pierre BIARD S. J.


FOOTNOTES:



[II.] We shall add to the letters of our first missionaries to Canada a
fragment of a memoir entitled: Records of New France, from the
year 1607 to the year 1737.&mdash;Of the Island of Martinique from
the year 1678.&mdash;Of the Island of Cayenne from the year 1668.


The translation of chapter II. of this manuscript, preserved in
our archives at Rome, will give a collection of facts about New
[2] France, which are not found in the letters we publish.


Among the gentlemen who offered themselves to Henry the Great,
of happy memory, to undertake the colonization of New France,
was sieur de Potrincourt. The king granted him all that he
asked, but at the same time gave him to understand that he must
take with him some religious persons from our Society for the purpose
of securing, according to his orders, the salvation of the
savages; furthermore, that the expense of this mission would in
no respect devolve upon him, but would be provided for from the
royal Treasury.


The Reverend Father Pierre Coton, then confessor and preacher
to the king, and who was very highly esteemed by His Majesty, as
we know, was commissioned by him to select, from his Society,
some men capable of conducting to a successful issue this perilous
and holy enterprise.


Many of our religious offered themselves for this distant mission.
Among them was noticed Father Pierre Biard, a man whose integrity
equaled his talent and who then occupied the chair of theology
at Lyons. The choice of the superiors fell upon him and upon
Father Ennemond Masse, of whom we shall speak hereafter.


They both departed in 1608 for Bordeaux, where they intended to
embark, but they were obliged to wait three years. For the gentleman,
of whom we have already spoken, postponed his departure;
then he offered as an excuse the necessity of making a trial voyage,
in order, said he, to prepare a suitable dwelling for the Fathers. In
fact he did make this journey, accompanied by a secular priest,
who, yielding to a thoughtless zeal, baptized a hundred savages
without having sufficiently instructed and tested them. Later, it
was discovered that these poor people had not even understood what
they had received.


Three years afterwards, on returning from his voyage, sieur de
Potrincourt, urged by the queen-mother, undertook to convey our
Fathers to [3] Canada. But it was not without great difficulty and
much suffering that they reached Port Royal, upon the coast of
Acadia.


The year following their arrival, two others of our Society went
to join them, namely, Father Quentin and Gilbert du Thet, a
Brother-coadjutor.30 A two years' sojourn in Port Royal demonstrated
to them the impossibility of making that the center of their
mission, either on account of the difficulty of attracting there a
great assemblage of savages, or because of the bickerings of those
in command. They transferred the seat of their mission to another
point upon the same coast, in latitude 45¬∞ 30', according to a decree
of the king. This settlement received the name of Saint Savior.
They had been established there but a short time, when the English,
coming upon them suddenly, took possession of the French ship,
seized the letters-patent of the commander, and, by a piece of
outrageous rascality, treated him as a pirate. At the moment of
attack several Frenchmen were killed, and among them brother
Gilbert du Thet, a man remarkable for his courage and piety.


The victorious English, after having pillaged as much as they
liked, abandoned part of the French in a miserable bark, and took
with them to Virginia Fathers Biard and Quentin. Our two prisoners
expected to be condemned to death, especially when, being taken
back to Port Royal they refused to make known the hiding-place of
the French who were concealed in the neighborhood. Turning
their course a second time toward Virginia, they would probably
have met death there, had not divine Providence frustrated all the
efforts of the English sailors to land. A violent storm cast them
upon the Azores islands, which belong to Portugal; and there, in
spite of all their efforts, they were obliged to disembark.


Even the English were forced to admire the loyalty and charity
[4] of our Fathers, who, by showing themselves to the Portuguese,
might have caused the seizure of the ship, and had the English condemned
and executed as pirates. Before entering port they exacted
from their prisoners the promise not to denounce them, and to keep
themselves concealed during their entire sojourn at the Azores.
While the Portuguese were visiting the ship, the Fathers remained
in the bottom of the hold, where they escaped observation. This
generosity and loyalty in keeping their word so surprised the English
that they immediately changed their treatment of their captives,
and took them directly to England, where they publicly eulogized
them.


The French ambassador, on hearing of their arrival, hastened to
reclaim them, and had them taken back honorably into their own
country, in the month of May, 1614.


This first voyage of our missionaries, apparently so futile, had,
however, fortunate results. Beside the experience acquired, of
which good use was made, the zeal of French catholics, revived by
the stories of the Fathers, created new resources; and as soon as
the French colony was delivered from the English, the Jesuits
resumed their voyages to Canada, where they finally founded one
of the finest missions of the Society.&mdash;[Carayon.]

[9] Lettre du P. Biard, au R. P. Christophe
Baltazar, Provincial de France
a Paris.

(Copi√©e sur l'autographe conserv√© aux Archives du
J√©sus √† Rome.)


Mon Reverend Pere,

Pax Christi.


Enfin, par la grace et faveur de Dieu, nous
voicy arrivez √† Port-Royal, lieu tant d√©sir√©, et apr√®s
avoir paty et surmont√©, pendant l'espace de sept mois,
force contradictions et traverses, que nous susciterent
√† Dieppe quelques-uns de la pretendue religion, et
sur mer, les fatigues, orages et tourmentes de l'hyver,
des vents et des tempestes. Par la misericorde
de Dieu et par les prieres de Vostre Reverence et de
nos bons Peres et Freres, nous voicy au bout de nostre
course, et au lieu tant souhait√©. Voicy aussi la premiere
commodit√© qui se presente pour escrire √† Vostre
Reverence, et lui faire s√ßavoir de nos nouvelles et de
l'estat auquel nous nous retrouvons. Je suis marry
que le peu de temps de nostre arriv√©e en ce pays ne
me permette pas d'en discourir, et comme je d√©sirerois
[10] plus amplement, et de l'estat de cette
pauvre nation; neantmoins je m'efforceray de vous
descrire non-seulement ce qui s'est pass√© en nostre
voyage, mais aussy tout ce qu'avons peu apprendre
de ce peuple depuis que nous y sommes, selon que,
je pense, tous nos bons seigneurs et amis avec Vostre
Reverence (doivent) l'attendre et le desirer.


140
Et, pour commencer par le pr√©paratif de nostre
voyage, Vostre Reverence aura sceu l'effort que firent
deux marchants de Dieppe de la religion pretendue,
qui avoient charge de fretter le navire, pour empescher
que n'y fussions re√ßus. Il y avoit j√† quelques
ann√©es que ceux qui avoient commenc√© et continu√© le
voyage de Canada, avoient desir√© quelques uns de
nostre Compagnie pour s'employer √† la conversion
de ce peuple l√†; et le feu Roy d'heureuse memoire
Henry le Grand avoit assign√© cinq cents escus pour
le voyage des premiers qui y seroient envoy√©s, quand
le R. P. Enmond Masse et moy, deput√©s pour ce voyage,
apr√®s avoir salu√© la Reyne Regente, entendu de
sa propre bouche le saint zele qu'elle avoit de la conversion
de ces peuples barbares, re√ßu les susdicts cinq
cents escus pour nostre viatique, ayd√©s aussi de la
pieuse lib√©ralit√© de Mesdames les Marquises de Guercheville,
Verneuil et de Sourdis, partis de Paris,
arrivasmes √† Dieppe au jour que nous avait assign√©
[11] Monsieur de Biancourt, fils de Monsieur de Potrincourt,
pour nous y prendre, s√ßavoir le 27 d'Octobre
1610.

Les deux susdicts marchants, aussitost qu'ils
ou√Ørent que deux Iesuites debvoient aller au Canada,
s'adresserent √† Monsieur de Biancourt[III.] et luy denoncerent
que si lesdicts Iesuites entroient au navire, ils
n'y vouloient rien avoir. On leur respondit que la
venu√´ des Iesuites ne leur nuyroit en rien; que, Dieu
mercy et la Reyne, ils avoient moyen de payer leur
pension sans grever aucunement leur fret. Ils persistent
142
toute fois en leur negative; et quoyque Monsieur
de Sicoine, gouverneur de la ville, fort zel√©
catholique, s'en entremeslast de bonne affection, si
ne p√ªt-il rien obtenir d'eux. A cette cause, Monsieur
Robbin,[IV.] le fils, autrement de Coloigne, associ√© avec
Monsieur de Biancourt pour le voyage, se delibera
d'aller en Cour et d√©clarer √† la Reyne cet accrochement;
ce qu'il fit. La Reyne sur cela donna lettres
addressantes √† Monsieur de Sicoigne, √† ce qu'il eust
√† declarer la volont√© du Roy √† present regnant, √™tre
telle, et avoir pareillement [12] est√© telle celle du
feu Roy d'eternelle memoire, que lesdicts Iesuites
allent en Canada; et par ainsy entendissent les contrariants
sur ce fait, qu'ils se trouveroient en opposition
contre le bon plaisir de leur Prince. Les lettres
estoient fort affectueuses; et pl√ªt √† Monsieur de Sicoigne
de mander √† soy tout le consistoire, et leur en
faire lecture. Si est-ce que pour tout cela, les marchants
sus mentionn√©s ne voulurent en rien d√©mordre;
seulement fut accord√© que, laissant √† part la question
des I√©suites, on chargeroit promptement le vaisseau,
de peur que cet embarras et dispute n'apportast du
retardement au secours qui promptement debvoit
estre donn√© √† Monsieur de Potrincourt.

Lors je pensois bien quasi toutes nos attentes estre
mises au rou√´t, et ne s√ßavois quelle clef nous en
pourroit assez desgager. Mais Monsieur de Coloigne
ne desespera point; ains, se montrant de sa gr√¢ce
toujours plus ardent √† poursuivre pour nous, fit entendre
en Cour, par un second voyage qu'il fit, y
avoir bien moyen de debouter les susdits marchants,
144
s√ßavoir est, en leur payant leur marchandise, et ainsi
les d√©dommageant. Madame de la Guercheville,
dame de grande vertu, recognoissant cet exp√©dient,
et jugeant n'estre convenable √† la pi√©t√© de la cour que
pour si peu un &oelig;uvre de Dieu fust arrest√©, et satan
en eust ainsi le [13] dessus, se d√©libera de faire un
queste pour mettre ensemble la somme de deniers
requise, et le fist avec telle diligence et si heureusement,
par la pieuse liberalit√© de plusieurs des Seigneurs
et Dames de la cour, qu'elle assembla bientost
quatre mil livres, et les envoya √† Dieppe. Ainsy lesdits
marchants furent exclus de tout le droict qu'ils
eussent p√ª avoir sur le vaisseau, sans rien perdre, et
nous y fusmes introduits.

Cet affaire et plusieurs autres qui survinrent dans
l'aprest de nostre voyage, furent cause que ne pusmes
partir de Dieppe avant le 26 janvier 1611. Monsieur
de Biancourt, jeune seigneur fort accomply et expert
en la maryne, estoit nostre conducteur, et chef du
vaisseau. Nous estions 36 personnes dans un navire
appel√© la Grace de Dieu, d'environ soixante tonneaux.
Nous n'eusmes que deux jours de bon vent; au troisiesme,
nous nous vismes subitement, par un vent et
mar√©es contraires, emport√©s jusques √† cent ou deux
cents pas des esquillons l'isle d'Wytht, en Angleterre;
et bien nous en print que nous y rencontrasmes
bon ancrage; sans cela resoluement c'estoit faict de
nous.

Eschapp√©s de l√†, nous relaschasmes √† Hyrmice et
depuis √† Ni√©port; en quoy nous consumasmes 18
jours. Le 16 de f√©vrier, premier jour de caresme,
[14] un bon norouest s'√©levant, nous donna moyen de
partir, et nous accompagna jusques hors de la Manche.
146
Ors ont accoustum√© les mariniers, venant √† Port-Royal,
de ne point prendre la droite route des isles
Ouessants jusqu'au Cap de Sable, ce qui abregeroit
beaucoup le chemin; car en cette fa√ßon, de Dieppe √†
Port-Royal, n'y auroit qu'environ mil lieues; ains
leur coustume est de descendre vers le Sud jusqu'aux
A√ßores, et de l√† tirer au grand banc, pour du grand
banc, selon que les vents se pr√©sentent, viser au Cap
de Sable, ou bien √† Campseaux, ou bien autre part.
Ils m'ont dict que pour trois raisons ils descendent
ainsi aux A√ßores: la premi√®re pour esviter la mer du
nort, qui est fort haute, disent-ils; la seconde, pour
s'ayder des vents du sud, qui volontiers reignent le
plus; la troisiesme, pour assurer leur estime: autrement
il est difficile qu'ils se recognoissent et dressent
leur voyage sans erreur. Mais nulle de ces causes a
eu effet quant √† nous, qui neantmoins avons suivy
cette coustume: non la premiere, parce que nous
avons experiment√© tant de tempestes et la mer si rude,
que je ne pense pas y avoir beaucoup de gain, nort
ou sud, sud ou nort; non la seconde, parce que souvent,
quand nous voulions le Sud, le Nort souffloit,
et √† retours; non enfin la troisiesme, d'autant que
nous ne pusmes point voir ces A√ßores, quoyque nous
fussions [15] descendus jusqu'√† 39 degr√©s et demy.
Ainsi toute l'estime de nos conducteurs s'embrouilla,
et nous n'estions pas encore aux A√ßores du grand
banc, quand quelques-uns opinoient que nous l'eussions
desj√† pass√©.

Le grand banc aux mol√ºes n'est pas, comme j'estimois
en France, quelque banc de sablon ou terre
qui apparoisse hors de la mer, ains est une grande
lisiere de terre soubs l'eau √† 35, 40 et 45 brasses,
large en quelques endroits de 25 lieu√´s. On l'appelle
banc, parce que c'est l√† premierement o√π venant des
148
abismes de l'ocean, l'on trouve terre avec la sonde.
Or, sur le bord de ce grand banc, les vagues sont
d'ordinaire fort furieuses trois ou quatre lieues durant,
et ces trois ou quatre lieues on appelle les
A√ßores.

Nous estions environ ces A√ßores le mardy de
Pasques, quand nous voicy en prou√´ notre ennemy
conjur√©, l'Ouest, avec telle furie et opiniastret√©, que
peu s'en fallut que nous ne perissions. De huict
jours entiers, il ne nous donna relasche, adjoustant √†
sa malice le froid et souvent la pluie ou la neige.

Naviger en ce traject de la Nouvelle-France, si
dangereux et si aspre, principalement en petits vaisseaux
et mal munitionnez, est un sommaire de toutes
les miseres de la vie. Nous n'avions repos ni [16] jour
ni nuict. Si nous pensions prendre nostre refection,
nostre plat subitement eschappoit contre la t√™te de
quelqu'un; un autre tomboit sour nous, et nous
contre quelque coffre, et tourneboulions avec d'autres
pareillement renversez; nostre tasse se versoit sur
nostre lict, et le bidon dans nostre seing, ou bien un
coup de mer mandoit nostre plat.

Monsieur de Biancourt m'honoroit de tant, que je
couchois dans sa chambre. Une belle nuict ainsy
qu'estant au lict nous pensions prendre quelque repos,
voicy qu'un gentil et hardy coup de mer qui
faussa les fermetures de la fenestre, la rompt et nous
vient couvrir bien hautement; autant en eusmes nous
une autre fois de jour. En outre, le froid estoit si
violent, et l'a est√© plus de six semaines durant, qu'√†
peine nous sentions nous d'engourdissement et de gel.
Le bon P√®re Masse a pati beaucoup. Il a demeur√©
quelques quarante jours malade sans manger que bien
peu, et quasi sans bouger du lict; encore vouloit-il
150
jeusner avec tout cela. Apr√®s Pasque, il meliora
tousjours, Dieu mercy de plus en plus. Pour moy,
j'estois gaillard, quand mesme plusieurs des matelots
se rendoient, et la Dieu gr√¢ce, je n'ay jamais tenu le
lict pour mal que j'eusse.

Eschapp√©s des tourmentes, nous entrasmes dans les
glaces sur les A√ßores du banc, degrez du nort 46.
Aucunes des glaces sembloient des isles, autres [17]
des petits bourgs, autres des grandes √©glises ou d√¥mes
bien haults, ou superbes chasteaux: toutes flottoient.
Pour les esviter, nous prismes au sud; mais ce fut
tomber, comme l'on dict, de Charybdis en Sylla, car
de ces haults rochers, nous tombasmes en un pav√© de
basse glace, la mer en estant toute couverte autant
que la vue pouvoit porter. Nous ne savions en passer;
et n'eust est√© la hardiesse de M. de Biancourt,
nos mariniers demeuroient sans expedient; mais il
fit passer outre, non obstant le murmure de plusieurs,
par o√π la glace estoit plus rare, et Dieu, par sa bont√©,
nous assista.

Le 5 de may, nous descendismes √† Campceau, et
eusmes le moyen d'y celebrer la sainte messe apr√®s
tant de temps, et nous sustenter de ce pain qui nourit
sans deffaut, et console sans fin. Depuis, nous costoyames
terre jusqu'√† Port-Royal, et y sommes arriv√©s √†
bons et heureux auspices le saint jour de Pencoste de
bon matin, s√ßavoir est le 22 de may,[V.] jour auquel le
soleil entre dans les Iumeaux. Nostre voyage avoit
dur√© quatre mois.

Il n'est possible d'exprimer l'ayse que re√ßurent de
nostre arriv√©e Monsieur de Potrincourt et les siens,
lesquels, durant tout cet hyver, se trouv√®rent [18] en
152
de tr√®s-grandes necessit√©s, comme je vous vais declarer.

Monsieur de Potrincourt avoit accompagn√© son fils
revenant en France sur la fin de juillet 1610, et y
estoit venu jusques au port Saint Iean,[VI.] autrement
dict Chachipp√©, distant du Port-Royal 70 lieu√´s est
et sud. Revenant et ayant redoubl√© le Cap de Sable,
se trouvant en la baye courante, accabl√© de fatigues,
il fut contraint de ceder le gouvernail pour un peu
dormir, donnant mandement √† celuy qui succedoit de
suivre toujours terre, jusqu'au plus profond de la
Baye. Ce successeur, ne s√ßay pourquoy, ne suyvit
pas le commandement, ains peu de temps apr√®s changea,
et abandonna terre.

Le Sauvage Membertou, qui suyvoit dans sa chaloupe,
fut estonn√© de cette route; n√©anmoins, n'en
s√ßachant pas la cause, n'en imita pas l'exemple, et si
n'en dit rien. Aussi arriva-t-il bientost √† Port-Royal,
l√† o√π M. de Potrincour erra par six semaines
en danger de se perdre; car le bon seigneur, s'estant
esveill√©, fut bien esbahy de se veoir en pleine mer, √†
perte de terre, dans une chaloupe. Il avait beau
regarder son cadran, car ne s√ßachant [19] quelle route
son gentil gouverneur avoit tenu√©, il ne pouvoit deviner
ni o√π il estoit, ni o√π il convenoit addresser. Un
autre mal, sa chaloupe ne pouvoit aller √† la boline,[VII.]
ayant est√©, ne scay comment, bris√©e par les flancs.
Ainsi, voulust-il ou non, il estoit necessit√© √† prendre
toujours vent derriere.

Un tiers inconvenient et grief: ils n'avoient de
154
vivres. N√©antmoins, c'est une homme qui ne se rend
pas facilement, et bonheur l'accompagne. Donc, en
cette perplexit√© de route, il se determina heureusement
de prendre au nord, et Dieu lui envoya ce qu'il
souhaitoit, un favorable Sud. Contre le mal de la
faim, sa prudence luy servit; car il avoit chass√© et
gard√© certain nombre de cormorans.[VIII.] Mais quel
moyen de les r√¥tir en une chaloupe, pour les manger
et garder? De bonne fortune, il se trouva avoir quelque
planche, sur laquelle il dressa un foyer, et ainsi
rotit son gibier, √† l'ayde duquel il arriva √† Pentegou√´t,
anciennement la Norembegue, et de l√† aux
Etechemins, puis √† l'embouscheure du Port-Royal,
o√π, par desastre, il pensa faire naufrage.

Il faisoit obscur quand il se trouva en cette entr√©e,
et ses gens commencerent √† lui, contredire, [20] niant
assur√©ment que ce fust l'embouscheure du Port-Royal.
Luy ou√Øt volontiers les opinions de ses gens,
et malheur qu'encore les suyvit-il, et aynsi prenant
en bas de la Baye Fran√ßoise, il s'en alla roder bien
loing √† la mercy des vents et des mar√©es. Cependant
ses gens estoient bien en peine au Port-Royal, et j√†
quasi tenoient-ils pour tout assur√© qu'il fust peri; √†
cela aydoit le sauvage Membertou, qui affirmoit luy
avoir veu prendre vers la mer √† perte de vu√´; d'o√π
l'on inferoit, comme l'on croit autant facilement ce
que l'on craint comme ce que l'on ayme, que puisque
tels ou tels vents avoient r√©gn√©, il estoit impossible
qu'avec une chaloupe, il eust peu eschapper.
Et j√† traitoit-on du retour en France. Or bien esbahis,
et ensemble bien joyeux furent-ils, quand ils
virent leur Th√©s√©e, revenu de l'autre monde; ce fut
156
six semaines apr√®s son depart, au m√™me temps que
M. de Biancourt arrivoit en France, le retour duquel
estoit attendu √† Port-Royal pour tout Novembre de
la m√™me ann√®e 1610. Mais on fut bien estonn√©,
quand non seulement on ne le vit pas √† No√´l, mais
aussi on perdit esp√©rance, √† cause de l'hiver, de le revoir
avant la fin d'apvril ensuivant.

Cette fut raison pour quoy on se retrancha de
vivres; mais ce retranchement profitoit peu, d'autant
que le Sieur de Potrincourt ne rabattoit rien [21] de
ses lib√©ralit√©s vers les Sauvages, craingnant les
aliener de la foy chrestienne. C'est un seigneur vrayment
liberal et magnanime, mesprisant toute recompense
des biens qu'il leur fait; de maniere que les
Sauvages, quand par fois on leur demande pourquoy
ils ne lui redonnent quelque chose pour tant de biens
qu'il leur faict, ont de coustumes de respondre malitieusement:
Endries ninan metaij Sagamo: c'est-√†-dire,
Monsieur ne se soucie point de nos peaux de
castor. N√©antmoins ils envoyoient par fois quelques
pieces d'orignac, qui aydoyent √† toujours gagner le
temps. Or, bon moyen pour espargner, voicy que,
l'hyver venu, leur moulin se glace, et n'y avoit
moyen de faire farine. Bon pour eux, qu'ils trouverent
provision de pois et febves; cette fut leur
manne et ambroisie sept semaines durant.

L√† estoit venu Apvril, mais non pas le navire, et
lors le moulin eut beau se glacer, car aussi bien n'y
avoit-il rien pour la tremye. Que fera-on? la faim
est un meschant mal. On se met √† pescher sur eau,
et fouiller soubs terre: sur eau, on eut des esplans et
du harang; soubs terre, on trouva de fort bonnes racines,
qu'on appelle chiqueli, et abondent fort en de
certains endroits.


158
Ainsi contentoit-on aucunement cet importun crediteur;
je dis aucunement parce que, le pain leur
[22] manquant, toute autre chose leur estoit peu, et
j√† faisoit-on estat que, si le navire ne venoit pour
tout le mois de may, que l'on se mettroit par la coste
en recherche de quelques navires, pour repasser au
doux pays de froment et vignoble. C'estoyent les
gens de Monsieur de Potrincourt qui parloient ainsi;
car pour luy, il avoit le courage, et si s√ßavoit bien
les moyens de faire attendre jusques √† la saint Iean.
Il n'en fut pas de besoing, Dieu mercy, car comme
dict est, nous arrivasmes le 22 de may. Or si, √†
cette venue, l'allegresse de Monsieur de Potrincourt et
de ceux de l'habitation fut grande, ceux l√† le pourront
conjecturer, qui s√ßavent ce que c'est de la faim,
du desespoir, de la crainte, de patir, d'estre pere,
et veoir ses entreprises et travaux √† volleau.

Nous pleurasmes tous au rencontre, et nous estimions
quasi songer; puis, quand nous fusmes un peu
revenus et entrez en propos, cette question fut mise
en avant, s√ßavoir: mon (de vrai) qui estoit le plus
ayse des deux, ou M. de Potrincourt et les siens, ou
M. de Biancourt et nous. De vray, nous avions bien
tous le c&oelig;ur bien eslargy, et Dieu, par sa misericorde,
donna signe d'y prendre plaisir; car, apr√®s la messe
et le disner, comme ce ne fusse qu'all√©e et venue du
navire √† l'habitation et de l'habitation au [23] navire,
chacun voulant caresser, et estre caress√© de ses amis,
comme apr√®s l'hyver on se resjou√Øt du beau temps,
et apr√®s le si√©ge de la libert√©, il arriva que deux de
l'habitation prindrent un canot des sauvages pour
aller au navire. Ces canots sont tellement faits que,
si on ne s'y tient pas bien juste et √† plomb, aussitost
160
on vire; arriva donc que, voulant retourner dans le
mesme canot du navire √† l'habitation ne s√ßay comment
ne charrierent pas droict, et eux dans l'eau.

Le bonheur porta que pour lors je me promenois
avec M. de Potrincourt √† la rive. Nous voyons l'accident,
et, √† nostre pouvoir faisions signe avec nos
chapeaux √† ceux du navire, de courir au secours;
car de crier, rien n'eust proffit√©, tant le navire estoit
esloign√©, et le vent faisoit du bruit. Personne n'y
prenoit garde du commencement; de maniere que
nostre recours fut √† l'oraison, et de nous mettre √†
genou, n'y voyant autre remede; et Dieu eut piti√©
de nous. L'un des deux se saisit du canot renvers√©,
et se jette dessus; l'autre, √† la parfin, fut secouru
d'une chaloupe, et tous deux ainsi retirez et sauvez
nous comblerent de liesse, voyant comme la bont√©
divine, par sa toute parternelle douceur, n'avoit point
voulu permettre que le malin esprit nous enviast et
funestast un si bon jour. A elle soit gloire √† tout jamays.
Ainsy soit-il.

[24] Or maintenant il est temps qu'arriv√©s par la
gr√¢ce de Dieu en sant√© nous jettions les yeux sur le
pays, et y considerions un peu l'estat de la chrestient√©
que nous y trouvons. Tout son fondement
consiste apr√®s Dieu en cette petite habitation d'une
famille d'environ vingt personnes. Messire Iess√©
Flesche, vulgairement dict le Patriarche, en a eu la
charge, et, dans un an qu'il y a demeur√©, a baptiz√©
quelque cent ou tant des Sauvages. Le mal a est√©
qu'il ne les a pu instruire comme il eust bien d√©sir√©,
faute de s√ßavoir la langue, et avoir de quoy les entretenir;
car celui qui leur nourrit l'√¢me faut quand
et quand qu'il se delibere de sustenter leur corps.
162
Ce bon personnage nous a fait beaucoup d'amiti√©, et
a remerci√© Dieu de nostre venue; car il avoit j√† de
longtemps resolu de repasser en France √† la premiere
commodit√©; ce qu'il est bien ayse de faire
maintenant, sans le regret d'abandonner une vigne
qu'il auroit plant√©e.

On n'a p√ª jusques √† maintenant traduire au langage
du pays la croyance commune ou symbole,
l'oraison de nostre Seigneur, les commandemens de
Dieu, les Sacremens et autres chefs totalement necessaires
√† faire un chrestien.

Estant derni√®rement au port Saint-Iean, je fus
adverty qu'entre les autres Sauvages, il y en avoit
cinq j√† chrestiens. Ie prends de l√† occasion de leur
[25] donner des images, et planter une croix devant
leur cabane, chantant un Salve Regina. Ie leur fis
faire le signe de la croix; mais je me trouvois bien
esbahy, car autant quasi y entendoient les non-baptiz√©s,
que les chrestiens. Ie demandois √† un chacun
son nom de baptesme; quelques-uns ne le s√ßavoient
pas, et ceux-l√† s'appeloient Patriarches; et la cause
est parce que c'est le Patriarche qui leur impose le
nom; car ils conclu√´nt ainsy, il faut qu'ils s'appellent
Patriarches, quand ils ont oubli√© leur vray nom.

Il y eut aussi pour rire, car lorsque je leur demandois
s'ils estoient chrestiens, ils ne m'entendoient
pas; quand je leur demandois s'ils estoient baptiz√©s,
ils me respondoient: Hetaion enderquir Vortmandia
Patriarch√©; c'est √†-dire: "Oui, le Patriarche nous a
fait semblables aux Normans." Or, appellent-ils
Normans tous les Fran√ßoys hormis les Malouins,
qu'ils appellent Samaricois, et les Basques qu'ils
disent Bascua.

Le sagamo, c'est-√†-dire le seigneur du port Saint-Iean,
164
est un appel√© Cacagous, fin et matois s'il n'y en
a point en la coste; c'est tout ce qu'il a rapport√© de
France (car il a est√© en France), et me disoit qu'il
avoit est√© baptiz√© √† Bajonne, me racontant cela
comme qui raconteroit d'avoir est√© par amiti√© conduit
√† un bal. Sur quoy, voyant le mal, et [26] voulant
esprouver si je luy esmouverois point la conscience,
je luy demandois combien il avoit de femmes. Il me
respondit qu'il en avoit huict; et de fait, il m'en
compta sept, qu'il avoit l√† presentes, me les d√©signant
avec autant de gloire, tant s'en faut qu'avec
honte, comme si je luy eusse demand√© combien il
avoit de fils legitimes.

Un autre, qui cherchoit plusieurs femmes, comme
je luy dissuadasse, luy alleguant qu'il estoit chrestien,
me paya de cette response: Reroure quiro Nortmandia:
c'est √†-dire Cela est bon pour vous autres,
Normans. Aussi ne voit-on gueres de changement
en eux apr√®s le baptesme. La mesme sauvagine et les
mesmes m&oelig;urs demeurent, ou peu s'en faut, mesmes
coustumes, ceremonies, us, fa√ßons et vices, au moins
√† ce qu'on en peut s√ßavoir, sans point observer aucune
distinction de temps, jours, offices, exercices,
prieres, debvoirs, vertus ou remedes spirituels.

Membertou, comme celuy qui hante le plus M. de
Potrincourt d√©s long temps, est aussi le plus zel√©, et
montre le plus de foy; mais encore il se plaint de ne
nous pas assez entendre, et desireroit d'estre prescheur,
dit-il, s'il estoit bien instruict. Ce fut luy
qui me fit l'autre jour une plaisante repartie; car,
comme je luy enseignois son Pater, selon la traduction
que m'en a fait M. de Biancourt, sur ce [27] que
je lui faisois dire: Nui en caraco nac iquem esmoi ciscou;
c'est-√†-dire, donne-nous aujourd'huy nostre pain quotidien.
166
"Mais, dit-il, si je ne luy demandois que du
pain, je demeurerois sans orignac ou poisson."

Le bon vieillard nous contoit avec grande affection
comme Dieu l'assiste depuis qu'il est chrestien, et
nous disoit que ce printemps, luy arriva de patir
grande faim luy et les siens; que sur ce il luy souvint
qu'il estoit chrestien, et par ce il pria Dieu.
Apr√®s sa pri√®re, allant veoir √† la riviere, il trouva
des esplans √† suffisance. Et puisque je suis sur ce
vieux sagamo, premices de cette gentilit√©, je vous
diray encore ce qui luy est arriv√© cet hyver.

Il a est√© malade, et ce qui est plus, jug√© √† mort par
les aoutmoins ou sorciers du pays. Or est la coustume
que d√®s aussitost que les Aoutmoins ont sentenci√© la
maladie ou plaie estre mortelle, d√®s lors le patient
ne mange plus; aussy ne luy donne-t-on rien. Ains,
prenant sa belle robe, il entonne luy-mesme le chant
de sa mort; apr√®s lequel cantique, s'il tarde trop √†
mourir, on luy jette force seaux d'eau dessus, pour
l'advancer, et quelquefois l'enterre-t-on √† demy vif.
Or les enfants de Membertou, quoy que chrestien,
se preparoient √† user de ce beau devoir de piet√© envers
leur p√®re; j√† ils ne luy donnoient plus √† manger,
et luy ayant prins sa [28] belle robe de loutre, avoit,
comme un cygne, chant√© et conclu sa N√¶nie ou
chant funerail. Une chose l'affligeoit encore, c'est
qu'il ne s√ßavoit pas pomment il debvoit bien mourir
en chrestien, et qu'il ne disoit point adieu √† M. de
Potrincourt. Ces choses entendues, M. de Potrincourt
vint √† luy, luy remonstre et l'asseure qu'en
despit de tous les Aoutmoins et Pilotois, il vivroit et
recouvreroit sant√©, s'il vouloit manger; ce qu'il estoit
tenu de faire, estant chrestien. Le bon homme crut,
168
et fut sauv√©; aujourd'huy il raconte cecy avec grand
contentement, et rememore bien √† propos comme
Dieu a misericordieusement en cela fait entendre la
malice et mensonge de leurs aoutmoins.

Je raconteray icy un autre faict du mesme Sieur
de Potrincourt, et qui a beaucoup proffit√© √† toute
cette gentilit√©. Un sauvage chrestien estoit mort, et
(marque de sa constance) il avoit mand√© icy √† l'habitation,
pendant sa maladie, qu'il se recommandoit
aux prieres. Apr√®s sa mort, les autres Sauvages se
preparoient de l'enterrer √† leur mode: leur mode est
qu'ils prennent tout ce qui appartient au defunct,
peaux, arcs, utensiles, cabannes, etc. bruslent tout
cela, hurlants, brayants avec certains clameurs, sorceleries
et invocations du malin esprit. M. de Potrincourt
delibera de vertueusement resister √† ces ceremonies.
Il met donc en armes toutes ses gens, et
[29] s'en va aux Sauvages en main forte, obtient par ce
moyen ce qu'il demandoit, s√ßavoir est que le corps
fust donn√© √† M. le Patriarche, et ainsi l'enterrement
fut faict √† la chrestienne. Cet acte, d'autant qu'il
n'a p√ª estre contrari√© par les Sauvages, a est√© lou√©
par eux, et l'est encores.

La chappelle qu'on a eue jusque √† maintenant, est
fort petite, pirement accomod√©e, et en toutes fa√ßons
incommode √† tous exercices de religion. Pour remede,
M. de Potrincourt nous a donn√© tout un quartier
de son habitation, si nous pouvons le couvrir et
accomoder. Seulement j'adjousteray encore un mot,
que plusieurs seront bien ayses et √©difi√©s d'ou√Ør.

Apr√®s mon arriv√©e icy √† Port-Royal, j'ay est√© avec
M. de Potrincourt jusque aux Etechemins. L√†, Dieu
voulut que je rencontrasse le jeune du Pont de Sainct
170
Malo, lequel ne s√ßays comment effarouch√©,[IX.] avoit
pass√© toute l'ann√©e avec les Sauvages, vivant de
mesme qu'eux. C'est un jeune homme d'une grande
force d'esprit et de corps, n'y ayant sauvage qui
courre, agisse ou patisse ou parle mieux que luy. Il
estoit en grandes apprehensions de M. de [30] Potrincourt;
mais Dieu me donna tant de croyance envers
luy, que sur ma parole il vint avec moy dans nostre navire,
et, apr√®s quelques submissions et debvoir rendu
par luy, la paix fut faite au grand contentement de
tous. Au d√©partir, comme les canonades bruy√®rent,
il me pria de luy assigner heure pour sa confession.
Au lendemain matin, luy mesme prevint l'heure,
tant il estoit en ferveur, et se confessa en l'or√©e de
la mer, en la pr√©sence de tous les Sauvages, qui s'√©merveilloient
d'ainsy le voir √† genoux devant moy si
long temps. Depuis, il communia avec grand exemple,
et puis dire que les larmes m'en vinrent aux
yeux, et ne fus pas seul. Le diable fut confus de cet
acte: aussy pensa-il subitement tout troubler l'apr√©s
disn√©e suivante; mais Dieu mercy, par l'√©quit√© et
bont√© de M. de Potrincourt, le tout a est√© remis en
son entier.

Voil√†, mon R√©v√©rend Pere, le discours de nostre
voyage et des choses survenues tant en yceluy que
devant celuy, et depuis nostre arriv√©e √† cette habitation.
Reste maintenant √† vous dire que la conversion
de ce pays √† l'Evangile, et de ce peuple √† la
civilit√©, n'est pas petite, ni sans beaucoup de difficultez;
car en premier lieu, si nous considerons le pays,
172
ce n'est qu'une forest, sans autre commodit√© pour la
vie que celles qu'on apportera de France, et avec le
temps on pourroit retirer du terroir, apr√®s qu'on [31]
l'aura cultiv√©. La nation est sauvage, vagabonde,
mal habitu√©e, rare et d'assez peu de gens. Elle est,
dis-je, sauvage, courant les bois, sans lettres, sans
police, sans bonnes m&oelig;urs; elle est vagabonde, sans
aucun arrest, ni des maisons ni de parent√©, ni des possessions
ni de patrie; elle est mal habitu√©e, gens extremement
paresseux, gourmans, irreligieux, traitres,
cruels en vengeance, et adonn√©s √† toute luxure,
hommes et femmes, les hommes ayant plusieurs
femmes et les abandonnant √† autruy, et les femmes
ne leur servant que d'esclaves qu'ils battent et assomment
de coups, sans qu'elles osent se plaindre; et
apr√®s avoir est√© demy meurtries, s'il plaist au meurtrier,
il faut qu'elles rient et luy fassent caresses.

Avec tous ces maux, ils sont extr√™mement glorieux:
ils s'estiment plus vaillans, que nous, meilleurs que
nous, plus ingenieux que nous, et, chose difficile √†
croire, plus riches que nous. Ils s'estiment, dis-je,
plus vaillants que nous, se vantant qu'ils ont tu√© des
Basques et Malouins, et fait beaucoup de mal aux
navires, sans que jamays on en ait tir√© vengeance,
voulant dire que ce a est√© faute de c&oelig;ur. Ils s'estiment
meilleurs: "Car, disent-ils, vous ne cessez de
vous entrebattre et quereller l'un l'autre; nous vivons
en paix. Vous estes envieux les uns des autres, et
d√©tractez les uns des autres ordinairement; [32] vous
estes larrons et trompeurs; vous estes convoiteux,
sans liberalit√© et misericorde: quant √† nous, si nous
avons un morceau du pain, nous le partissons entre
nous."


174
Telles et semblables choses disent-ils communement,
voyant les susdictes imperfections en quelques-uns
de nos gens; et, se flattent de ce que quelques-uns
d'entre eux ne les ont si √©minentes, ne
considerant (pas) qu'ils ont tous des vices beaucoup
plus √©normes, et que la meilleure part des nostres
n'ont pas mesmes les vices susdicts, concluent universellement
qu'ils vallent mieux que tous les chrestiens.
C'est l'amour propre qui les aveugle, et le
malin esprit qui les seduit, ne plus ne moins que
vous voyez en nostre France les desvoy√©s de la foy
s'estimer et se vanter estre meilleurs que les catholiques,
d'autant qu'en quelques-uns ils voyent beaucoup
de vices, ne regardants ni les vertus des autres
catholiques, ni leurs vices beaucoup plus grands; ne
voulant, comme Cyclopes, avoir, qu'un seul &oelig;il, et
celuy fich√© sur aucuns vices de quelques catholiques,
et jamays sur les vertus des autres, ni sur eux, sinon
pour se tromper.

Ils s'estiment aussi plus ingenieux, d'autant qu'ils
nous voyent admirer aucunes de leurs manufactures,
comme &oelig;uvres de personnes si rudes et grossieres,
[33] et admirent peu ce que nous leur monstrons,
quoy que beaucoup plus digne d'estre admir√©, faute
d'esprit. De l√† vient qu'ils s'estiment beaucoup plus
riches que nous, quoy qu'ils soyent extremement
pauvres et souffreteux.

Cacagous, duquel j'ai cy-devant parl√©, a bonne
grace, quand il a un peu hauss√© le ton; car pour
monstrer sa bonne affection envers les Fran√ßoys, il
se vante de vouloir aller veoir le Roy, et luy porter
un present de cent castors, et fait estat, ce faisant, de
le faire le plus riche de tous ses predecesseurs. La
176
cause aussy de ce jugement leur vient de l'extreme
et bruslante convoitise de leurs castors qu'ils voyent
regner en quelques-uns des nostres.

Non moins plaisant est le discours d'un certain
Sagamo, qui ayant ouy raconter de M. de Potrincourt,
que le Roy estoit jeune et √† marier: "Peut-estre, dit-il,
luy pourray-je donner ma fille pour femme; mais,
selon les us et coustumes du pays, il faudroit que le
Roy lui fist de grands presens: s√ßavoir, quatre ou
cinq barriques de pain, trois de pois ou de febves, un
de petun, quatre ou cinq chapots de cent sols pi√®ce,
avec quelques arcs, flesches, harpons, et semblables
denr√©es."

Voyl√† les marques de l'esprit de cette nation, qui
est fort peu peupl√©e, principalement les Soriquois et
Etechemins qui avoysinent la mer, combien, que [34]
Membertou assure qu'en sa jeunesse il a veu chimonuts,
c'est-√†-dire des Sauvages aussi dru sem√©s que
les cheveux de la teste. On tient qu'ils sont ainsi
diminu√©s depuis que les Fran√ßois ont commenc√© √† y
hanter: car, depuis ce temps-l√†, ils ne font tout l'est√©
que manger; d'o√π vient que, prenant une tout autre
habitude, et amassant de humeurs, l'automne et l'hyver
ils payent leurs intemperies par pleur√©sies, esquinances,
flux de sang, qui les font mourir. Seulement
cette ann√©e, soixante en sont morts au Cap de la
H√®ve, qui est la plus grande partie de ce qu'ils y
estoient; et neantmoins personne du petit peuple de
M. de Potrincourt n'a est√© seulement malade, nonobstant
toute l'indigence qu'ils ont paty; ce qui a faict
apprehender les Sauvages que Dieu nous deffend et
prot√©ge comme son peuple particulier et bien-aym√©.

Ce que je dis de cette raret√© d'habitants de cette
178
contr√©e, se doict entendre de ceux qui paroissent en
la coste de la mer; car, dans les terres, principalement
des Etechemins, il y a force peuple, √† ce qu'on
dit. Toutes ces choses conjoinctes avec la difficult√©
du langage, le temps qu'il y faudra consommer, les
despends qu'il y faudra faire, les grandes incommoditez
et labeurs et disettes qu'il faudra endurer, declarent
assez la grandeur de cette entreprise, et les
difficult√©s qui la pourront traverser. Toutes [35] fois
plusieurs choses m'encouragent √† la poursuite d'icelle.

Premierement l'esperance que j'ay en la bont√© et
providence de Dieu. Esa√Øe nous assure que le royaume
de nostre Redempteur doict estre recognu par
toute la terre, et qu'il ne doict avoir ni antres de dragons,
ni cavernes de basilisques, ni rochers inaccessibles,
ni abysmes tant profonds que son humanit√©
n'adoucisse, son salut ne guerisse, son abondance ne
fertilise, son humilit√© ne surhausse, et enfin que sa
croix ne triomphe victorieusement. Et pour quoy
n'esperay-je que le temps est venu auquel cette prophetie
doict estre accomplie en ces quartiers? Que
si cela est, qu'y a-t-il de tant difficile que nostre Dieu
ne puisse faciliter?

En second lieu, je mets la consideration du Roy
nostre Sire. C'est un Roy qui nous promet rien de
moindre que le feu Roy son pere l'incomparable
Henri le Grand. Cet &oelig;uvre a commenc√© avec son
reigne, et peut on dire que depuis cent ann√©es la
France s'est appropri√© ce pays, ou en a si veritablement
pris possession, ny tant faict, que depuis son
reigne, que Dieu remplisse de toutes benedictions.
Il ne voudra permettre que son nom et ses armes
paroissent en ces regions avec le paganisme, son authorit√©
180
avec la barbarie, sa renomm√©e avec la sauvagine,
son pouvoir avec l'indigence, [36] sa foy avec
manquement, ses subjects sans ayde ni secours. Sa
m√®re aussy, une autre Reyne Blanche, visant √† la
gloire de Dieu, contemplera ces deserts et nouveliers
siens, o√π, au commencement de sa Regence, le coutre
de l'Evangile a par son moyen ouvert quelque esperance
de moisson, et se souviendra de ce que le feu
Roy, grand de sagesse aussi bien que de valeur, pronon√ßa
au Sieur de Potrincourt venant en ce pays:
"Allez, dit-il, je trace l'√©difice; mon fils le bastira."
Ce que nous supplions vostre Reverence de luy representer,
et ensemble le bon &oelig;uvre que leurs Majest√©s
peuvent faire en ces quartiers, si c'estoit leur
bon playsir de fonder et donner quelque honneste
revenu √† cette residence, de laquelle se pourroit
s'epandre par toute cette contr√©e ceux qui y seroyent
eslev√©s et entretenus.

Voyl√† le second fondement de nostre esperance,
auquel j'adjousteray la piet√© et largesse que nous
avons experiment√© sur nostre depart √®s-seigneurs et
dames de cette tres-noble et tres-chrestienne cour,
me promettant qu'ils ne voudront manquer de favoriser
de leurs moyens cette entreprise, pour ne perdre
ce que desj√† ils y ont employ√©, ce qui leur sert d'ares
de gloire et de felicit√© immortelle devant Dieu.

M. de Potrincourt, Seigneur doux et √©quitable,
[37] vaillant, am√© et experiment√© en ces quartiers, et
M. de Biancourt son fils, imitateur des vertus et
belles qualitez de son pere, tous deux zel√©s au service
de Dieu, qui nous honorent et cherissent plus que
nous ne meritons, nous donnent aussi grand courage
de nous employer en ceste ouvrage de tout nostre
pouvoir.


182
Finalement, l'assiete et condition de ce lieu, qui
promet beaucoup pour l'usage de la vie humaine, s'il
est cultiv√©, et sa beaut√©, qui me fait esmerveiller de
ce qu'il a est√© si peu recherch√© jusques √† maintenant,
o√π est ce port o√π nous sommes, fort propre pour d'icy
nous estendre aux Armouchiquois, Iroquois et Montagnes,
nos voisins, qui sont grands peuples, et labourent
les terres comme nous; ce lieu, dis-je, nous fait
esperer quelque chose √† l'advenir. Que si nos Souriquois
sont peu, ils se peuvent peupler; s'ils sont
sauvages, c'est pour les domestiquer et civiliser qu'on
vient icy; s'ils sont rudes; nous ne devons point estre
pour cela paresseux; s'ils ont jusqu'ici peu profit√©,
ce n'est merveille, ce seroit rigueur d'exiger si tost
fruict d'un gref, et demander sens et barbe d'un
enfant.

Pour conclusion, nous esperons avec le temps les
rendre susceptible de la doctrine de la foy et religion
chrestienne et catholique, et apr√®s, passer [38] plus
avant aux regions de de√ß√† plus habit√©es et cultiv√©es,
comme dict est; esperance que nous appuyons sur
la bont√© et misericorde de Dieu, sur le zele et fervente
charit√© de tous les gens de bien qui affectueusement
desirent le royaume de Dieu, particulierement
sur les sainctes prieres de Vostre Reverence et de
nos RR. PP. et tr√®s-chers FF. auxquels tr√®s-affectueusement
nous nous recommandons.

[9] Letter from Father Biard to Reverend Father
Christopher Baltazar, Provincial
of France, at Paris.

(Copied from the autograph preserved in the Archives
of Jesus, at Rome).


My Reverend Father,
The peace of Christ be with you.


At last by the grace and favor of God, here we
are at Port-Royal, the place so greatly desired, after
having suffered and overcome, during the space of
seven months, a multitude of trials and difficulties
raised up against us at Dieppe by those belonging to
the pretended religion; and after having survived at
sea the fatigues, storms, and discomforts of winter,
winds, and tempests. By the mercy of God, and
through the prayers of Your Reverence and of our good
Fathers and Brothers, here we are at the end of our
journey and in the long-wished-for place. And I am
now taking the first opportunity which presents itself
to write to Your Reverence, and to communicate to you
news of ourselves and of our present situation. I am
sorry that the short time we have been in this country
does not permit me to write about it at length, as I
was desirous [10] of doing, and about the condition of
these poor people; however, I will try to describe to
you not only what happened in our voyage, but also
all that we have been able to learn of these peoples
since our arrival, as I believe all our good noblemen
and friends, as well as Your Reverence, expect and
desire me to do.

141

So, to begin with the preparations for our voyage,
Your Reverence must know about the effort put forth
by two Dieppe merchants of the pretended religion,
who were charged with freighting the ship, to prevent
our being received upon it. For a number of
years past, those who began and continued to make
voyages to Canada have wished some of our Society
to be employed for the conversion of the people of
that country; and Henry the Great, the late King, of
happy memory, had set aside five hundred √©cus34 for
the voyage of the first ones who should be sent
there: at this time Reverend Father Enmond Masse
and I, chosen for this mission, after having saluted
the Queen Regent and learned from her own utterances
the holy zeal which she felt for the conversion
of this barbarous people, and having received the
above-mentioned five hundred √©cus for our viaticum,35
aided also by the pious liberality of the
Marchionesses de Guercheville, Verneuil, and de
Sourdis,36 left Paris and arrived at Dieppe upon the
day which [11] Monsieur de Biancourt, son of Monsieur
de Potrincourt, had designated for our departure,
the 27th of October, 1610.

The two above-mentioned merchants, as soon as
they heard that two Jesuits were going to Canada, addressed
themselves to Monsieur de Biancourt[X.] and
warned him that, if the said Jesuits intended to embark
upon the ship, they would have nothing to do
with it: they were told that the presence of the
Jesuits would in no wise interfere with them; that,
thanks to God and the Queen, they had the money
143
to pay their passage without in the least disturbing
their cargo. They still persisted, however, in their
refusal; and although Monsieur de Sicoine, governor
of the city, a very zealous catholic, kindly interposed,
he could gain nothing from them. For this reason,
Monsieur Robbin,[XI.] his son,
otherwise called de Coloigne,37
a partner of Monsieur de Biancourt in this
voyage, thought he would go to Court and make
known this difficulty to the Queen; he did so. The
Queen, thereupon, sent letters addressed to Monsieur
de Sicoigne, telling him to announce that the will of
the present King, as well as [12] that of the late King
of eternal memory, was that these Jesuits should go
to Canada; and that those who were opposing their
departure were doing so against the will of their
Prince. The letters were very kind: and Monsieur
de Sicoigne was pleased to assemble the consistory,
and read them to that body. Notwithstanding all
this, the merchants would not yield in the least; it
was merely granted that, leaving the Jesuits out of
the question, they should promptly load their ship,
lest these perplexities and disputes should cause
some delay in bringing the succor to Monsieur de
Potrincourt, which must be given promptly. Then
I almost made up my mind that all our hopes were
doomed to disappointment, for I did not see how we
were to be extricated from these difficulties. Monsieur
de Coloigne did not despair; but, showing himself
in his kindness always more eager to pursue the
case for us, by a second journey he convinced the
Court of an excellent plan for thwarting the merchants;
namely, by paying them for their cargo, and
145
thus indemnifying them. Madame de la Guercheville,
a lady of great virtue, recognizing the expediency
of this plan, and deeming it inconsistent with
real piety to allow a godly work to be checked for such
a trifle, and thus [13] that satan should be permitted
to triumph, determined to try and raise the sum of
money required; and she did so with such diligence
and success, through the pious generosity of several
Noblemen and Ladies of the court, that she soon collected
four thousand livres and sent them to Dieppe.
Thus the merchants were deprived of all the rights
which they might have had in the vessel, without
losing anything, and we were admitted into it.

This, and other incidents interfering with the
preparations for our voyage, were the reasons why
we could not leave Dieppe before the 26th of January,
1611. Monsieur de Biancourt, a very accomplished
young gentleman, and well versed in matters pertaining
to the sea, was our leader and commander. There
were thirty-six of us in the ship, which was called
la Grace de Dieu, of about sixty tons burden. We
had only two days of favorable winds; on the third
day we suddenly found ourselves carried, by contrary
winds and tides, to within a hundred or two hundred
paces of the breakers of the isle of Wight, in England;
and it was fortunate for us that we found good
anchorage there, for otherwise we certainly should
have been lost.

Leaving this place we put into port at Hyrmice,
and then at Newport; by which we lost eighteen
days. The 16th of February, first day of lent, [14]
a good northwester arising allowed us to depart, and
accompanied us out of the English Channel. Now
mariners, in coming to Port Royal, are not accustomed
147
to take the direct route from the Ouessant
islands to Cape Sable, which would lessen the distance,
for in this way, from Dieppe to Port Royal,
there would only be about one thousand leagues; but
they are in the habit of going South as far as the
Azores, and from there to the great bank, thence,
according to the winds, to strike for Cape Sable, or
Campseaux, or elsewhere. They have told me that
they go by way of the Azores for three reasons: first,
in order to avoid the north sea, which is very
stormy, they say; second, to make use of the south
winds, which usually prevail there; third, to be sure
of their reckonings; for otherwise it is difficult to
take their bearings and arrange their route without
error. But none of these causes affected us, although
we followed this custom. Not the first, for we were
so tossed about by tempests and high seas, that I do
not think we gained much by going north or south,
south or north; nor the second, because often when
we wanted the South, the North wind blew, and vice
versa; and certainly not the third, inasmuch as we
could not even see the Azores, although we went
[15] down as far as 39¬∞ 30'. Thus all the calculations
of our leaders were confounded, and we had not yet
reached the Azores of the great bank when some of
them thought we had passed it.38

The great codfish bank is not, as I thought in
France, a kind of sand or mud-bank, appearing above
the surface of the sea; but is a great sub-marine plateau
35, 40 and 45 fathoms deep, and in some places
twenty-five leagues in extent. They call it bank,
because, in coming from the deep sea, it is the first
place where bottom is found with the sounding lead.
Now upon the border of this great bank, for the
space of three or four leagues, the waves are generally
149
very high, and these three or four leagues are called
the Azores.

We were near these Azores on Tuesday of Easter
week, when suddenly we became a prey to our
sworn foe, the West wind, which was so violent and
obstinate that we very nearly perished. For eight
entire days it gave us no quarter, its vindictiveness
being augmented by cold and sometimes rain or snow.

In taking this route to New France, so rough and
dangerous, especially in small and badly-equipped
boats, one experiences the sum total of all the miseries
of life. We could rest neither [16] day nor night.
When we wished to eat, a dish suddenly slipped from
us and struck somebody's head. We fell over each
other and against the baggage, and thus found ourselves
mixed up with others who had been upset in
the same way; cups were spilled over our beds, and
bowls in our laps, or a big wave demanded our
plates.

I was so highly honored by Monsieur de Biancourt
as to share his cabin. One fine night, as we were
lying in bed, trying to get a little rest, a neat and impudent
wave bent our window fastenings, broke the
window, and covered us over completely; we had the
same experience again, during the day. Furthermore,
the cold was so severe, and continued to be for
more than six weeks, that we lost nearly all sensation
from numbness and exposure. Good Father
Masse suffered a great deal.39 He was ill about forty
days, eating very little and seldom leaving his bed;
yet, notwithstanding all that, he wanted to fast.
After Easter he continued to improve, thank God,
more and more. As for me, I was gay and happy,
and, by the grace of God, was never ill enough to
151
stay in bed even when several of the sailors had to
give up.

After escaping from these trials, we entered the ice
at the Azores of the bank, 46 degrees north latitude.
Some of these masses of ice seemed like islands,
others [17] little villages, others grand churches or
lofty domes, or magnificent castles: all were floating.
To avoid them we steered towards the south;
but this was falling, as they say, from Charybdis
into Scylla, for from these high rocks we fell into a
level field of low ice, with which the sea was entirely
covered, as far as the eye could reach. We did not
know how to steer through it; and had it not been
for the fearlessness of Monsieur de Biancourt, our
sailors would have been helpless; but he guided us
out, notwithstanding the protests of many of them,
through a place where the ice was more scattered,
and God, in his goodness, assisted us.

On the 5th of May, we disembarked at Campceau,40
and there had the opportunity of celebrating holy
mass after so long a time, and of strengthening ourselves
with that bread which never fails to nourish
and console. Then we coasted along until we
reached Port Royal, where we arrived under good
and happy auspices early in the morning41 of the
holy day of Pentecost, the 22nd of May,[XII.]
the day
upon which the sun enters the constellation Gemini.
Our voyage had lasted four months.

The joy of Monsieur de Potrincourt and his followers,
at our arrival, is indescribable. They had
been, during the entire winter, reduced [18] to sore
straits, as I am going to explain to you.

153

Monsieur de Potrincourt had accompanied his son
a part of the way upon the latter's return to France
the last of July, 1610, and had gone as far as port
Saint John,[XIII.]
otherwise called Chachipp√©,42 70 leagues
east and south of Port Royal. When he was returning,
as he veered around Cape Sable, he found himself
in a strong current; weakened by hardships, he
was obliged to yield the helm, in order to take a little
rest, commanding his successor to always keep near
the shore, even in the deepest part of the Bay. This
pilot, I know not why, did not follow his orders, but
soon afterward changed his course and left the shore.

The Savage, Membertou, who was following in his
boat, was astonished that Poutrincourt should take
this route; but, not knowing why he did so, neither
followed him nor said anything about it. So he
soon arrived at Port Royal, while Monsieur de Potrincourt
drifted about for six weeks, in danger of being
hopelessly lost; for this worthy gentleman, when he
awoke, was very much surprised at seeing himself
in a small boat in the open sea, out of sight of
land. He looked at his dial in vain, for not knowing
[19] what route his amiable pilot had taken, he
could not guess where he was, nor in what direction
to turn. Another misfortune was that his boat would
not sail on a bowline,[XIV.] having been somehow damaged
in the sides. So, whether he wished to do so or
not, he was always obliged to sail before the wind.

A third inconvenience and misfortune was a lack
of food. However, he is a man who does not easily
155
give up, and good luck follows him. Now in this
perplexity about the route, he fortunately decided to
turn to the north, and God sent him what he desired,
a favorable South wind. His thrift served him against
the misfortune of hunger, for he had hunted and kept
a certain number of cormorants.[XV.] But how could
they be roasted in a small boat, so as to be eaten and
kept? Fortunately he found he had a few planks,
upon which he built a fire-place, and thus roasted the
game; by the aid of which he arrived at Pentegou√´t,
formerly Norembegue, and from there to the Etechemins,
thence to the harbor of Port Royal, where by
a piece of ill luck, he was nearly shipwrecked.

It was dark when he entered this harbor, and his
crew began to oppose him, stoutly denying [20] that
they were in the harbor of Port Royal. He was willing
to listen to their objections, and unfortunately even
yielded to them; and so turning to the lower part of
French Bay, he went wandering away off at the mercy
of the winds and waves. Meanwhile the colonists of
Port Royal were in great anxiety and had already
nearly made up their minds that he was lost; the savage,
Membertou, strengthened this fear by asserting
that he had seen him sail out of sight upon the sea;
whence it was inferred, since people believe as easily
what they fear as what they favor, that as such and
such a wind had prevailed, it was impossible for them
to escape in such a boat. And they were already
planning their return to France. Now they were
greatly astonished, and at the same time exceedingly
happy when they saw their Theseus return from another
world; this was six weeks after his departure,
157
just when Monsieur de Biancourt arrived in France,
whose return was expected at Port Royal during the
whole month of November of the same year, 1610.
But they were very much surprised when they did
not see him at Christmas; then they lost all hope, on
account of the winter weather, of seeing him again
before the end of the following April.

For this reason they cut down their rations; but
such economy was of little avail, since Sieur de Potrincourt
did not lessen [21] his liberality toward the
Savages, fearing to alienate them from the Christian
faith. He is truly a liberal and magnanimous gentleman,
refusing all recompense for the good he does
them; so when they are occasionally asked why they
do not give him something in return for so many
favors, they are accustomed to answer, cunningly:
Endries ninan metaij Sagamo, that is to say, "Monsieur
does not care for our beaver skins." Nevertheless,
they have now and then sent him some pieces of elk
meat, which have helped him to gain time [i.e., to
save his own provisions]. But they, the French, had
a good chance of economizing when winter came, for
their mill froze up, and they had no way of making
flour. Happily for them they found a store of peas
and beans, which proved to be their manna and ambrosia
for seven weeks.

Then April came, but not the ship; now it was just
as well that the mill was frozen up, for they had
nothing to put in the hopper. What were they to do?
Hunger is a bad complaint. Some began to fish,
others to dig. From their fishing they obtained some
smelts and herrings; from their digging some very
good roots, called chiqueli, which are very abundant
in certain places.

159

Thus this importunate creditor was somewhat satisfied;
I say somewhat, because, when there was no
bread, [22] everything else was of little account; and
they had already made up their minds that, if the ship
did not come during the month of May, they would resort
to the coast, in search of ships to take them back
to the sweet land of wheat and vines. It was Monsieur
de Potrincourt's followers who talked this way; as
for him, he was full of courage and knew well how
he could manage to hold out until saint John's day
[midsummer]. Thank God, there was no need of
this, for, as has been said, we arrived the 22nd of May.
Those who know what hunger, despair, fear and
suffering are, what it is to be a leader and see all
one's enterprises and hard work come to nought, can
imagine what must have been the joy of Monsieur de
Potrincourt and his colony upon seeing us arrive.

We all wept at this meeting, which seemed almost
like a dream; then when we had recovered ourselves
a little and had begun to talk, this question (mine, in
fact) was proposed, to wit: Which was the happier of
the two, Monsieur de Potrincourt and his people, or
Monsieur de Biancourt and his? Truly, our hearts
swelled within us, and God, in his mercy, showed that
he took pleasure in our joy; for, after mass and dinner,
there was nothing but going and coming from
the ship to the settlement, and from the settlement to
the [23] ship, each one wanting to embrace and be
embraced by his friends, just as, after the winter, we
rejoice in the beautiful spring, and after a siege, in
our freedom. It happened that two persons from the
settlement took one of the canoes of the savages to
go to the ship. These canoes are so made that, if
you do not sit very straight and steady, they immediately
161
tip over; now it chanced that, wishing to
come back in the same canoe from the ship to the settlement,
somehow they did not properly balance it,
and both fell into the water.

Fortunately, it occurred at a time when I happened
to be walking upon the shore with Monsieur de Potrincourt.
Seeing the accident, we made signs with
our hats as best we could to those upon the ship to
come to their aid; for it would have been useless to
call out, so far away was the ship, and so loud the
noise of the wind. At first no one paid any attention
to us, so we had recourse to prayer, and fell upon
our knees, this being our only alternative; and God
had pity upon us. One of the two caught hold of the
canoe, which was turned upside down, and threw
himself upon it: the other was finally saved by a
boat, and thus both were rescued; so our cup of joy
was full in seeing how God in his all paternal love
and gentleness, would not permit the evil one to
trouble us and to destroy our happiness upon this
good day. To him be the glory forever. Amen!

[24] But now that we have arrived in good health,
by the grace of God, it is time we were casting our eyes
over the country, and were giving some consideration
to the condition in which we find christianity here.
Its whole foundation consists, after God, in this little
settlement of a family of about twenty persons.
Messire Jess√© Flesche, commonly called the Patriarch,
has had charge of it; and, in the year that he has
lived here, has baptized about one hundred Savages.
The trouble is, he has not been able to instruct them
as he would have wished, because he did not know
the language, and had nothing with which to support
them; for he who would minister to their souls, must
163
at the same time resolve to nourish their bodies.
This worthy man has shown great friendliness toward
us, and thanked God for our coming; for he had made
up his mind some time ago to return to France at the
first opportunity, which he is now quite free to do without
regret at leaving a vine which he has planted.

They have not yet succeeded in translating into
the native language the common creed or symbol,
the Lord's prayer, the commandments of God, the
Sacraments, and other principles quite necessary to
the making of a christian.

Recently, when I was at port Saint John, I was informed
that among the other Savages there were five
who were already christians. Thereupon I took occasion
to give them [25] some pictures, and to erect a
cross before their wigwams, singing a Salve Regina.
I had them make the sign of the cross; but I was
very much astonished, for the unbaptized understood
almost as much about it as the christians. I asked
each one his baptismal name; some did not know
theirs, so they called themselves Patriarchs, because
it is the Patriarch who gives them their names, and
thus they conclude that, when they have forgotten
their own names, they ought to be called Patriarchs.

It was also rather amusing that, when I asked
them if they were christians, they did not know what
I meant; when I asked them if they had been baptized,
they answered: Hetaion enderquir Vortmandia
Patriarch√©, that is to say, "Yes, the Patriarch has
made us like the Normans." Now they call all the
French "Normans," except the Malouins,43 whom they
call Samaricois, and the Basques, Bascua.

The name of the sagamore, that is, the lord of port
Saint John, is Cacagous, a man who is shrewd and cunning
165
as are no others upon the coast; that is all that he
brought back from France (for he has been in France);
he told me he had been baptized in Bayonne, relating
his story to me as one tells about going to a ball out
of friendship. Whereupon, seeing how wicked he
was, and [26] wishing to try and arouse his conscience,
I asked him how many wives he had. He
answered that he had eight; and in fact he counted
off seven to me who were there present, pointing
them out with as much pride, instead of an equal
degree of shame, as if I had asked him the number of
his legitimate children.

Another, who was looking out for a number of
wives, made the following answer to my objections
on the ground that he was a Christian: Reroure quiro
Nortmandia: which means, "That is all well enough
for you Normans." So there is scarcely any change
in them after their baptism. The same savagery and
the same manners, or but little different, the same
customs, ceremonies, usages, fashions, and vices remain,
at least as far as can be learned; no attention
being paid to any distinction of time, days, offices, exercises,
prayers, duties, virtues, or spiritual remedies.

Membertou, as the one who has most associated
with Monsieur de Potrincourt for a long time, is
also the most zealous and shows the greatest faith,
but even he complains of not understanding us well
enough; he would like to become a preacher, he says,
if he were properly taught. He gave me a witty answer
the other day, as I was teaching him his Pater,
according to the translation made of it by M. de Biancourt,
when [27] I had him say: Nui en caraco nac
iquem esmoi ciscou; that is, "Give us this day our daily
bread." "But," said he, "if I did not ask him for
167
anything but bread, I would be without moose-meat
or fish."

The good old man told us, with a great deal of
feeling, how God is helping him since he has become
a Christian, saying that this spring it happened that
he and his family were suffering much from hunger;
then he remembered that he was a christian, and
therefore prayed to God. After his prayer, he went
to the river and found all the smelts he wanted.
And while I am speaking of this old sagamore, the
first fruit of this heathen nation, I will tell you also
what happened this winter.

He was sick, and what is more, had been given up
to die by the native aoutmoins, or sorcerers. Now it
is the custom, when the Aoutmoins have pronounced
the malady or wound to be mortal, for the sick man
to cease eating from that time on, nor do they give
him anything more. But, donning his beautiful
robe, he begins chanting his own death-song; after
this, if he lingers too long, a great many pails of
water are thrown over him to hasten his death, and
sometimes he is buried half alive. Now the children
of Membertou, though christians, were prepared to
exercise this noble and pious duty toward their
father; already they had ceased giving him anything
to eat and had taken away his [28] beautiful otter
robe, and he had, like the swan, finished his N√¶nie,
or funeral chant. One thing still troubled him, that he
did not know how to die like a christian, and he had
not taken farewell of Monsieur de Potrincourt.
When M. de Potrincourt heard these things, he
went to see him, remonstrated with him, and assured
him that, in spite of all the Aoutmoins and Pilotois,
he would live and recover his health if he would eat
169
something, which he was bound to do, being a christian.
The good man believed and was saved; to-day
he tells this story with great satisfaction, and very
aptly points out how God has thereby mercifully exposed
the malice and deceit of their aoutmoins.

I shall here relate another act of the same Sieur de
Potrincourt, which has been of great benefit to all
these heathen. A christian savage had died, and (as
a mark of his constancy) he had sent word here to the
settlement during his sickness, that he desired our
prayers. After his death the other Savages prepared
to bury him in their way; they are accustomed to take
everything that belongs to the deceased, skins, bows,
utensils, wigwams, etc., and burn them all, howling
and shouting certain cries, sorceries, and invocations
to the evil spirit. M. de Potrincourt firmly resolved
to oppose these ceremonies. So he armed all his
men, and [29] going to the Savages in force, by this
means obtained what he asked, namely, that the body
should be given to the Patriarch, and so the burial
took place according to christian customs. This act,
inasmuch as it could not be prevented by the Savages,
was and still is, greatly praised by them.

The chapel they have been using until now is very
small, badly arranged, and in every way unsuited for
religious services. To remedy this, M. de Poutrincourt
has given us an entire quarter of his habitation,
if we can roof it over and adapt it to our needs. But
I shall add one more word which will be pleasant and
edifying news to many.

After my arrival here at Port Royal, I went with
M. de Potrincourt as far as the Etechemins. There
God willed that I should meet young du Pont, of
Sainct Malo,44 who, having been for some reason
171
frightened away [from the settlement],[XVI.] had passed the
entire year with the Savages, living just as they did.
He is a young man of great physical and mental
strength, excelled by none of the savages in the
chase, in alertness and endurance, and in his ability
to speak their language. He was very much afraid
of M. de [30] Potrincourt: but God inspired me with
so much faith in him that, relying upon my word, Du
Pont came with me to our ship; and after making
some apologies and promises, peace was declared, to
the great satisfaction of all. When he departed, as
the cannon were sounding, he begged me to appoint
an hour to receive his confession. The next morning,
in his great eagerness, he anticipated the hour,
and made his confession upon the shores of the sea in
the presence of all the Savages, who were greatly
astonished at thus seeing him upon his knees so long
before me. Then he took communion in a most exemplary
manner, at which I can say tears came into
my eyes, and not into mine alone. The devil was
confounded at this act; so he straightway planned
trouble for us that very afternoon; but thank God,
through the justice and goodness of M. de Potrincourt,
harmony was everywhere restored.

And now you have had, my Reverend Father, an
account of our voyage, of what happened in it, and
before it, and since our arrival at this settlement. It
now remains to tell you that the conversion of this
country to the Gospel, and of these people to civilization,
is not a small undertaking nor free from great
difficulties; for, in the first place, if we consider the
173
country, it is only a forest, without other conveniences
of life than those which will be brought from
France, and what in time may be obtained from the
soil after [31] it has been cultivated. The nation is
savage, wandering and full of bad habits; the people
few and isolated. They are, I say, savage, haunting
the woods, ignorant, lawless and rude: they are wanderers,
with nothing to attach them to a place, neither
homes nor relationship, neither possessions nor love
of country; as a people they have bad habits, are extremely
lazy, gluttonous, profane, treacherous, cruel
in their revenge, and given up to all kinds of lewdness,
men and women alike, the men having several
wives and abandoning them to others, and the women
only serving them as slaves, whom they strike and
beat unmercifully, and who dare not complain; and
after being half killed, if it so please the murderer,
they must laugh and caress him.

With all these vices, they are exceedingly vainglorious:
they think they are better, more valiant and
more ingenious than the French; and, what is difficult
to believe, richer than we are. They consider
themselves, I say, braver than we are, boasting that
they have killed Basques and Malouins, and that
they do a great deal of harm to the ships, and that no
one has ever resented it, insinuating that it was from
a lack of courage. They consider themselves better
than the French; "For," they say, "you are always
fighting and quarreling among yourselves; we live
peaceably. You are envious and are all the time
slandering each other; [32] you are thieves and deceivers;
you are covetous, and are neither generous
nor kind; as for us, if we have a morsel of bread we
share it with our neighbor."

175

They are saying these and like things continually,
seeing the above-mentioned imperfections in some of
us, and flattering themselves that some of their own
people do not have them so conspicuously, not realizing
that they all have much greater vices, and that
the better part of our people do not have even these
defects, they conclude generally that they are superior
to all christians. It is self-love that blinds them,
and the evil one who leads them on, no more nor
less than in our France, we see those who have deviated
from the faith holding themselves higher and
boasting of being better than the catholics, because
in some of them they see many faults; considering
neither the virtues of the other catholics, nor their
own still greater imperfections; wishing to have, like
Cyclops, only a single eye, and to fix that one upon
the vices of a few catholics, never upon the virtues
of the others, nor upon themselves, unless it be for
the purpose of self-deception.

Also they [the savages] consider themselves more
ingenious, inasmuch as they see us admire some of
their productions as the work of people so rude and
ignorant; [33] lacking intelligence, they bestow very
little admiration upon what we show them, although
much more worthy of being admired. Hence they
regard themselves as much richer than we are, although
they are poor and wretched in the extreme.

Cacagous, of whom I have already spoken, is quite
gracious when he is a little elated about something;
to show his kindly feelings toward the French he
boasts of his willingness to go and see the King, and
to take him a present of a hundred beaver skins,
proudly suggesting that in so doing he will make
him richer than all his predecessors. They get this
177
idea from the extreme covetousness and eagerness
which our people display to obtain their beaver skins.

Not less amusing is the remark of a certain Sagamore,
who, having heard M. de Potrincourt say that
the King was young and unmarried: "Perhaps," said
he, "I may let him marry my daughter; but according
to the usages and customs of the country, the King
must make me some handsome presents; namely,
four or five barrels of bread, three of peas or beans,
one of tobacco, four or five cloaks worth one hundred
sous apiece, bows, arrows, harpoons, and other similar
articles."

Such are the marks of intelligence in the people of
these countries, which are very sparsely populated,
especially those of the Soriquois and Etechemins,
which are near the sea; although [34] Membertou assures
us that in his youth he has seen chimonuts, that is
to say, Savages, as thickly planted there as the hairs
upon his head. It is maintained that they have thus
diminished since the French have began to frequent
their country; for, since then they do nothing all
summer but eat; and the result is that, adopting an
entirely different custom and thus breeding new
diseases, they pay for their indulgence during the
autumn and winter by pleurisy, quinsy and dysentery,
which kill them off. During this year alone
sixty have died at Cape de la H√®ve, which is the
greater part of those who lived there; yet not one of
all M. de Potrincourt's little colony has even been
sick, notwithstanding all the privations they have
suffered; which has caused the Savages to apprehend
that God protects and defends us as his favorite and
well-beloved people.

What I say about the sparseness of the population
179
of these countries must be understood as referring to
the people who live upon the coast; for farther inland,
principally among the Etechemins, there are,
it is said, a great many people. All these things,
added to the difficulty of acquiring the language, the
time that must be consumed, the expenses that must
be incurred, the great distress, toil and poverty that
must be endured, fully proclaim the greatness of this
enterprise and the difficulties which beset it. Yet
[35] many things encourage me to continue in it.

First, my trust in the goodness and providence of
God. Isaiah assures us that the kingdom of our
Redeemer shall be recognized throughout the earth;
and that there shall be neither caves of dragons
nor dens of cockatrices, nor inaccessible rocks, nor
abysses so deep, that his grace will not soften and his
salvation cure, his abundance fertilize, his humility
raise up, and over which his cross will not at last
victoriously triumph. And why shall I not hope
that the time has come when this prophecy is to be
fulfilled in these lands? If that be so, what can there
be so difficult that our Lord cannot make it easy?

In the second place, I rely upon the King, our Sire.
He is a Sovereign who promises us nothing less than
the late King, his father, the incomparable Henry
the Great. This work began in the latter's reign,
and it may be said that in the century since France
has appropriated this country, or has so completely
taken possession of it, there has not been so much accomplished
at any time as since our present king became
sovereign; may God fill his reign with all
blessings. He will not permit his name and arms to
stand in these regions side by side with paganism,
his authority with barbarism, his renown with savagery,
181
his power with poverty, [36] his faith with lack
of works, nor leave his subjects without aid or succor.
His mother also, another Queen Blanche,45 looking
to the glory of God, will contemplate these lately-acquired
wildernesses, where in the beginning of
her Regency the Gospel plough has, through her instrumentality,
created some hope of a harvest; and
will recall what the late King, great in wisdom as
well as in courage, said to Sieur de Potrincourt when
he came to this country: "Go," said he. "I plan
the edifice; my son will build it." We beg your
Reverence to lay this matter before him, together
with the work which might be done by their Majesties
in these lands, if it were their good pleasure to endow
and to give a fair revenue to this mission, from
which all those who would be educated and maintained
here might go forth through the whole country.

That is the second resource upon which our hopes
are founded; to which I will add the piety and liberality
which we experienced upon our departure
from the lords and ladies of this most noble and most
christian court, who promised me that they would
not fail to assist this enterprise with their means, in
order not to lose what they have already invested in
it, which serves them as monuments of glory and of
eternal happiness before God.

M. de Potrincourt, a mild and upright Gentleman,
[37] brave, beloved and well-known in these parts, and
M. de Biancourt, his son, who reflects the virtues and
good qualities of his father, both zealous in serving
God, and who honor and cherish us more than we
deserve, also encourage us in devoting all our energy
to this work.

Finally, we are encouraged by the situation and
183
condition of this place, which, if it is cultivated,
promises to furnish a great deal for the needs of
human life; and its beauty causes me to wonder that
it has been so little sought up to the present time.
From this port where we now are, it is very convenient
for us to spread out to the Armouchiquois, Iroquois,
and Montagnais, our neighbors, which are
populous nations and till the soil as we do; this situation,
I say, makes us hope something for the future.
For, if our Souriquois are few, they may become
numerous; if they are savages, it is to domesticate
and civilize them that we have come here; if they
are rude, that is no reason that we should be idle; if
they have until now profited little, it is no wonder,
for it would be too much to expect fruit from this
grafting, and to demand reason and maturity from a
child.

In conclusion, we hope in time to make them susceptible
of receiving the doctrines of the faith and of
the christian and catholic religion, and later, to penetrate [38]
farther into the regions beyond, which they
say are more populous and better cultivated. We
base this hope upon Divine goodness and mercy,
upon the zeal and fervent charity of all good people
who earnestly desire the kingdom of God, particularly
upon the holy prayers of Your Reverence and of
our Reverend Fathers and very dear Brothers, to
whom we most affectionately commend ourselves.

From Port Royal, New France, this tenth day of
June, one thousand six hundred and eleven.

[39] Lettre du P√®re Ennemond Masse au R. P.
Claude Aquaviva, G√©n√©ral de la
Compagnie de J√©sus.

(Traduite sur l'original latin.)


Port-royal, 10 juin 1611.

Mon Tr√®s-r√©v√©rend P√®re,
Pax Christi.


Si Votre Paternit√© a vu avec plaisir ma lettre
du 13 octobre, j'en ai √©prouv√© bien davantage √† recevoir
la sienne du 7 d√©cembre; d'autant plus que je
suis le premier de la Compagnie qui ait re√ßu la premi√®re
lettre que Votre Paternit√© ait jamais envoy√©e
au Canada. Je prends ce fait comme un heureux augure,
et je l'accepte comme venant du ciel, pour
m'exciter √† courir avec ferveur dans la carri√®re, afin de
m√©riter et de recevoir le prix de cette vocation c√©leste, et
enfin de me sacrifier moi-m√™me plus promptement et
plus compl√©tement pour le salut de ces peuples.

Je vous l'avoue; j'ai dit alors franchement √† Dieu:
Me voici: Si vous choisissez ce qu'il y a de faible et de
m√©prisable dans ce monde, pour renverser [40] et d√©truire
ce qui est fort, vous trouverez tout cela dans Ennemond.
Me voici: envoyez-moi, et rendez ma langue et
ma parole intelligible, afin que je ne sois pas barbare pour
ceux qui m'entendront.

Vos pri√®res, j'en ai la confiance, ne seront pas sans
succ√®s, comme semble le pr√©sager notre arriv√©e ici,
le tr√®s-saint jour de la Pentec√¥te. Nous sommes faibles

[39] Letter from Father Ennemond Masse to Reverend
Father Claude Aquaviva, General
of the Society of Jesus.

(Translated from the Latin original.)


Port Royal, June 10, 1611.

My Very Reverend Father,

The peace of Christ be with you


If Your Reverence read with pleasure my
letter of October 13th, I felt a great deal more in
receiving yours of December 7th, especially as I am
the first of the Society to receive from Your Reverence
the first letter which you have ever sent to Canada.
I take this event as a happy omen, and accept it as
coming from heaven, to incite me to run with ardor
in the race, in order to merit and receive the reward
of this heavenly vocation, and to sacrifice myself more
promptly and more completely for the salvation of
these people.

I admit to you that I said then freely to God: Here
I am; if you choose what is weak and despicable in this
world to overthrow [40] and destroy that which is strong,
you will find all this in Ennemond. Here I am; send
me, and make my tongue and my words intelligible, so that
I may not be a barbarian to those who will hear me.

Your prayers, I am sure, will not be in vain, as our
arrival here upon the most holy day of Pentecost
seems to presage. We are weak in Jesus Christ, but, I
hope, we shall live with him by the power of God. It is
187my earnest entreaty that Your Reverence, by your
prayers and holy sacrifices, may prevail upon the Lord
to accomplish all these things in us.

The unworthy son in Jesus Christ, of the Society
of Jesus,


Ennemond MASSE.


Port Royal, New France, June 10, 1611.

Aquaviva, G√©n√©ral de la Compagnie
de J√©sus.

(Traduite sur l'original latin.)


Port-Royal, 11 juin 1611.

Mon Tr√®s-R√©v√©rend P√®re,

Pax Christi.


Apr√®s quatre mois d'une navigation vraiment
tr√®sp√©nible et tr√®s-p√©rilleuse, nous sommes enfin arriv√©s,
gr√¢ce √† la protection de Dieu et aux pri√®res de
Votre Paternit√©, √† Port-Royal, dans cette Nouvelle-France,
terme de notre voyage.

Nous avons en effet quitt√© Dieppe le 26 janvier de
cette ann√©e 1611, et nous sommes arriv√©s cette m√™me
ann√©e le 22 mai. Je donne en fran√ßais au R. P. Provincial
la relation de toute notre entreprise et de
l'√©tat o√π nous avons trouv√© les choses ici. C'est ce
qui me paraissait plus urgent et plus utile, puisque
j'√©tais dans l'impossibilit√© de le faire en m√™me temps
en latin. Je ne me suis pas encore arr√™t√© huit jours
√† Port-Royal, et tout le temps est [42] absorb√© par des
interruptions continuelles et par les n√©cessit√©s de la
vie. Au reste, le P. Masse et moi, nous nous portons
assez bien, gr√¢ce √† Dieu: mais il nous a fallu
prendre un serviteur pour les travaux mat√©riels.
Nous ne pouvions nous en passer sans un grand d√©triment
pour l'esprit et pour le c&oelig;ur.

M. de Potrincourt, qui commande ici au nom du Roi,
nous aime et nous estime en proportion de sa pi√©t√©.


190
A la premi√®re occasion nous nous empresserons,
avec la gr√¢ce de Dieu, de dire quelles sont nos esp√©rances
de succ√®s.

Le vaisseau s'est d√©j√† √©loign√©. Je vais √™tre oblig√©
d'aller le rejoindre en canot, pour qu'il ne parte sans
mes lettres.

Je conjure Votre Paternit√©, par les m√©rites de J√©sus-Christ,
de se souvenir de nous et de ces contr√©es
tr√®s-solitaires, et de venir √† notre secours, autant
qu'elle le pourra, non-seulement par le moyen des
pri√®res tr√®s-ferventes de notre Compagnie, mais aussi
par la b√©n√©diction et les faveurs de notre Saint-P√®re
le Pape (comme je les ai d√©j√† demand√©es).

Assur√©ment nous semons dans une grande pauvret√©
et dans les larmes; daigne le Seigneur nous accorder
de moissonner un jour dans la joie. C'est ce
qui arrivera, comme je l'esp√®re et comme je l'ai [43]
dit, gr√¢ce aux pri√®res et aux b√©n√©dictions de Votre
Paternit√©, que je sollicite humblement,


de Votre Paternit√©,

Le fils et serviteur indigne,

Pierre BIARD, S. J.

[41] Letter from Father Pierre Biard, to the Very
Reverend Father Claude Aquaviva, General
of the Society of Jesus.

(Translated from the Latin original.)


Port Royal, June 11, 1611.


My Very Reverend Father,

The peace of Christ be with you.


After four months of very painful and perilous
navigation, we have at last arrived, thanks to the
protection of God and to the prayers of Your Reverence,
at Port Royal, in New France, the end of our
journey.

In truth we left Dieppe the 26th of January this
year, 1611, and arrived May 22nd of this same year.
I am giving to the Reverend Father Provincial the
narrative in French of our whole undertaking, and
of the condition in which we found things here.
This seemed to me the more necessary and useful, as
it was impossible for me to write it at the same time
in Latin. I have not yet been settled a week in Port
Royal, and all the time has [42] been taken up by continual
interruptions and in providing the necessities
of life. As to ourselves, Father Masse and I, we are
feeling very well, thank God; but we have been
obliged to take a servant to do the drudgery. We
could not dispense with one without a great deal of
anxiety and trouble.

M. de Potrincourt, who commands here in the
name of the King, loves and esteems us in proportion
to his piety.

191

We shall take the first opportunity to impart to you
what may be, by the grace of God, our prospects of
success in this country.

The ship has already gone. I shall be obliged to
overtake it in a canoe, that it may not leave without
my letters.

I conjure Your Reverence, through the merits of
Jesus Christ, to remember us and these solitary
lands, and to come to our aid in so far as you are
able, not only by the fervent prayers of our Society,
but also by the blessing and favor of our Holy Father
the Pope (which I have already invoked). Surely we
sow in great poverty and in tears; may the Lord
grant that we some day reap in joy. Which will
come to pass, as I hope and have said, [43] through
the prayers and blessings of Your Reverence, which
are humbly solicited by your


Unworthy son and servant,

Pierre BIARD, S. J.


Port Royal, New France, or Canada, June 11,
1611.

[i] P. Petri Biardi Eulogium ac Vita.

DE Patre Petro Biardo qui tantam in Missione
Canadica inchoanda partem gessit h√¶c scribit
Pater Josephus Juvencius in sua Histori√¢ sub anno
1622.

"Ex omnibus qui hoc anno vivere in provincia
Lugdunensi desierunt, luctu maximo elatus est Avenione
P. Petrus Biardus Gratianopolitanus. Religionis
propagand√¶ studio navigaverat ad barbaros
Canadenses, fueratque inter primos ejus terr√¶ cultores,
ut in quinta parte narratum est. Inde pulsus ab
h√¶reticis Anglis, &amp; redire in Galliam coactus, totum
se impendit [ii] juvandis popularibus suis, quorum
ut saluti consuleret, nihil sibi reliqui ad laborem
diligentiamque faciebat. Ejus tamen industriam experti
maxime sunt Parodienses in pr√¶fectura Carolitana,
quam civitatem per usitata ordinis ministeria
diu coluit. Novissime regionis pr√¶fectus Marchio
Ragnius, jussus a rege copias in Campaniam ducere
contra Ernestum Mansfeldium Galli√¶ finibus imminentem,
Biardum sibi adsciverat comitem expeditionis,
&amp; sacrorum ministrum. Per eam occasionem
nescias, utrum spectata magis sit apostolici viri charitas,
an patientia. Magna erat in castris inopia commeatuum.
Diaria militibus pr√¶bebantur adeo maligne,
ut nonnulli fame perirent. Biardus cibario, &amp;
198
demensum suum, ac siquid pr√¶terea pecuniol√¶ a ditioribus
emendicando corrogasset, inter egentissimos
militum partiebatur, se ipsum fraudans diurno victu,
ut aliis benigne faceret. Avenionem concesserat
[iii] denique, ut attritas tot laboribus vires paucorum
dierum otio reficeret. Verum quasi divinans, instare
sibi omnium laborum &amp; vit√¶ finem, totum illud
tempus impendit excolendo piis commentationibus
animo inter tirones, seque ad primam tirocinii formam
senex emeritus ita composuit, ut nullam omitteret
earum exercitationum, quibus ad sui mundique contemptum
erudiri solent novitii. His intentum, nihilque
jam pr√¶ter c√¶lestia cogitantem mors oppressit,
xv. Cal. Decembris."

Adh√¶c non inutile forsan videbitur adjicere qu√¶ ab
auctore antiquiore Philippo scilicet Alegambe scripta
sunt in Catalogo Scriptorum Societatis Jesu, sub
verbo Biard:

"Petrus Biardus natione Gallus, patri√¢ Gratianopolitanus,
operarius magni zeli, atque ade√≤ multarum
palmarum, quas [iv] in horridis et inuiis Canadensium
Septentrionalis Americ√¶ populorum siluis primus
legit. Extrema ibi omnia passus, nihil tamen inhumanum
magis, qu√†m H√¶reticos, expertus est. Feritatis
oblita gens barbara integerrimi hominis innocentiam
venerari discebat; c√πm ecce tibi sanctitatis
inimica, Deumque nesciens H√¶resis, cum Anglis
Canad√¶ oras irrupit; difficillim√¶ expeditionis ingens
pretium fuit, exosum inde abducere Jesuitam. Habitus
200
est in vinculis aliquamdiu; &amp; vix tandem in
Galliam nudus ab omni remissus. Intere√† ver√≤ dum
integrum illi esset ad noualia Canad√¶ redire, damnum
ab H√¶reticis illatum sanct√® vitus est: reliquo
vit√¶ tempore qu√¶siuit intentissimis studiis ad vitam
illos, √† quibus ad necem adductus fuerat. Docuerat
olim Theologiam Lugduni, non sine laude. Reuersus
√® Missione Castrensi, c√πm Auenionem diuertisset, &amp;
opportunitate temporis vsus secessisset in Nouitiatum,
in ipsis [v] pen√® spiritualium Exercitiorum initiis, ad
paradisi contemplationem, vt credimus, euocatus est,
die XIX. Nouembris, Anno MDCXXIJ.

197
[i] Eulogy and Life of Father Peter Biard.

CONCERNING Father Peter Biard, who performed
so great a part in the establishment of
the Canadian Mission, Father Joseph Juvency46
writes these things in his History, under the year
1622:

"Of all who during the present year have departed
this life in the province of Lyons, the most regretted
was Father Peter Biard, of Grenoble, who, was
taken away at Avignon. With the desire of propagating
religion, he had journeyed to the barbarous
Canadians, and had been among the first settlers of
that country, as has been narrated in the fifth part (of
this volume). Upon being driven thence by the heretical
English, and compelled to return to France, he entirely
devoted himself [ii] to the service of his countrymen;
and, that he might provide for their salvation,
in no respect showed himself deficient either in
labor or diligence. His industry, however, was especially
enjoyed by the Paray le Monial, in the prefecture
of Charolles, which community he long served
with the customary ministrations of the order. Finally,
the prefect of the district, Marchio Ragne, upon
being ordered by the king to lead troops into Campania
against Ernest von Mansfeld,47 who was threatening
the frontiers of France, had selected Biard as his
companion during the expedition, and as a minister
of sacred rites. Upon that occasion one would doubt
whether the charity of the apostolic man, or his patience,
were the more remarkable. There was in the
camp a great scarcity of provisions. Rations were so
199
poorly furnished to the soldiers that some perished
with hunger. Biard divided among the most needy
of them, both his own allowance and whatever small
sums of money he had collected by begging from the
more wealthy, depriving himself of daily sustenance,
that he might do a kindness to others. He had retired
to Avignon, [iii] at last, that he might with a few
days' leisure refresh his energies, which had been
worn out by so many toils. But divining, as it were,
that the end of all labors and of life was at hand, he
spent all that period in disciplining his spirit by pious
meditations among the novices; and, although an
aged man who had served his time, so adapted himself
to the earliest form of the novitiate, that he
omitted none of those exercises by which beginners
are educated to a contempt of themselves and of the
world. While intent upon these, and already thinking
of nothing but heavenly things, death seized him
on the 17th day of November."

To these things it will perhaps not seem useless to
add what has been written by an earlier author,
namely, Philip Alegambe,48 in the Bibliography of the
Authors of the Society of Jesus, under the word
Biard:

"Peter Biard, a French citizen, born in Grenoble,
a laborer of great zeal, and of very many laurels
which [iv] he first gathered in the dreadful and pathless
forests of the Canadian tribes of North America. Although
suffering there every extremity, he still experienced
nothing more brutal than the Heretics.
The barbarous race, forgetting its savageness, was
learning to venerate the character of this most righteous
man; when, behold, Heresy, hostile to holiness
and ignorant of God, burst, together with the English,
upon the shores of Canada. The reward of a
201
very laborious expedition was great,&mdash;to drive thence
the hated Jesuit. For some time he was kept in
bonds; and at last, stripped of everything, he was
with difficulty restored to France. But meanwhile,
until it was safe to return to the wilds of Canada, he
took vengeance in a holy manner for the injury inflicted
by the Heretics; during the rest of his life he
sought with the greatest enthusiasm to win to life
those by whom he had been devoted to death. He
had formerly taught Theology at Lyons, not without
commendation. On his return from the Military
Mission, when he had turned aside to Avignon, and,
making use of his opportunity, had retired into
the Novitiate, in [v] almost the very beginning of his
spiritual Exercises, he was called away to the contemplation
of paradise, as we believe, on the 19th
day of November, in the year 1622.

Besides a Letter to R. P. General Commander from
Port Royal, and An Account of the Expedition of the
English against Canada, Father Biard wrote A Book Advocating
the authority of the Pontiff against Martinet, a
minister. In French, also, he published separately
An Account of New France and of the journey thither of
the Fathers of the Society of Jesus. Lyons, by L. Muguet,
1616, in 12mo."&mdash;[O'Callaghan.]

An Account of the Canadian Mission.

[321 ¬ß. II.] THE SOCIETY OF JESUS INTRODUCED
INTO CANADA, OR NEW FRANCE.

NORTH AMERICA is occupied principally by
three nations&mdash;the Spanish, the French, and
the English. Mexico, a part of Florida and of
California, belongs to the Spanish dominions. The
shores opposite to the rising sun, and stretching Southward,
have been occupied at various times by the English,
the Swedes, and the Dutch. The French possess
the territory which lies between these and the Mexicans,
towards the north and west, commonly called
New France or Canada. Nothing fouler and more
hideous than the savage Canadians could have been
imagined, before they began to soften under the influence
of religion, as will appear from matters to be
presented in the tenth Paragraph. Now, barbarism
and the vile array of sins have given place to reason
and virtue, which seems to confirm our faith in this
ancient prophecy:Isaiah, c. 35. The land that was desolate and
impassable shall be glad, and the wilderness shall rejoice,
and shall flourish like the lily.

206
INITIUM CANADIC√Ü MISSIONIS, &amp; PRIMI FRUCTUS.

AMERIC√Ü littora, Franci√¶ obversa, Galli jam
inde ab anno MDXXIV. identidem lustraverunt:
sed obiter, &amp; quasi pr√¶tereuntes. Demum
superiori seculo ineunte, regionem interiorem
subiit Samuel Camplenius, qui Canadensis coloni√¶
parens merito dici potest. Jamque negotiatio bellissim√®
procedebat, cum Henricus IV. de religione
magis, qu√†m de commercio solicitus, in hanc Orbis
novi partem inferre Christiana sacra decrevit, anno
MDCVIII. ac Societatis homines ad hanc Apostolicam
expeditionem postulavit. Certior de consilio
Regis factus P. Petrus Cotonus, regi√¶ conscienti√¶
moderator, jussusque strenuos quamprimum designare
sacerdotes, qui solida tanti operis jacerent fundamenta,
Societatis Pr√¶positum admonuit. Ex omni, non
juvenum modo, sed etiam senum, numero, laboriosam
Missionem flagitantium, delecti sunt P. Petrus
Biardus, Gratianopolitanus, theologi√¶ professor in collegio
Lugdunensi; &amp; P. Enemundus Mass√¶us, Lugdunensis.
Moram consiliis felicibus attulit Regis improvisa
mors; &amp; Societatis amicorum studia, qui
navem &amp; reliqua itineri necessaria comparabant, debilitavit.
Sed invicta rebus adversis Cotoni pietas,
Regin√¶ auctoritatem interposuit, ut difficultates objectas
profligaret. Ergo indicitur profectio: Patres
208
Deppam advolant, inde vela Novam in Franciam
facturi. Ecce autem repent√® inexpectatus obex. Ea
navis erat Potrincurtii, nobilis Galli: duobus tamen
mercatoribus Calvinianis obnoxia, utpote qui sumptus
non leves ad illam armamentis instruendam fecerant.
Isti simul atque imponendos in hanc homines Societatis
audierunt, negant enimvero se passuros ut √® portu
solvat. Opponitur imperium Regin√¶, mandata ingeminantur.
Respondent per se non stare quin sacerdotes
alii quilibet admittantur; at sibi cum nostris
hominibus nihil esse rei velle. Ubi vidit Cotonus
improborum pertinaciam frangi non posse, alia rem
aggressus est via. Erat matrona non pietate minus
qu√†m genere nobilis, Antonia Guerchevill√¶a. H√¶c
negotium Missionis haud secus procurabat, ac suum:
utque non vulgarem apud multos gratiam, virtutis
opinione collegerat, magnam subito pecuni√¶ vim
corrogavit, qua mercatoribus h√¶reticis summa rependeretur,
ab iis in adornandam navim contributa. Sic
illis rejectis &amp; invitis, Patres admissi suerunt. At,
quia interim extractum tempus fuerat, non ante VII.
Kalend. Februarias, cum hyemaret asperum √¶quor,
vela sunt facta. Hinc mensium quatuor cursus fuit,
qui vulgo duorum est; ac morbis intus, tempestatibus
foris, infestus. Ingressi demum ostia Laurentiani fluvii
XI. Kal. Junias, ipso sacro Pentecostes die, vestigia
Christian√¶ religionis aliqua invenere, leviter ab iis
quos √® Gallia profectos in hanc plagam diximus, impressa.
Cum enim illis ignotus [322] gentis sermo,
210
nec certum constansque in humo barbara domicilium
esset, facultas non suppetebat erudiendi quos obiter
baptizabant: quique pristinos in mores revoluti,
Christianum vix retinebant nomen, illudque popularibus
vitiis conspurcabant. Prima Patribus cura
fuit ut sacellum construerent, perdiscerent linguam
vernaculam, excolerent Gallos, qui √® veteri Francia
in novam navigaverant. Instituta est solennis supplicatio;
Christus sanctissimi Sacramenti velo tectus,
&amp; quanto fieri potuit maximo apparatu circumvectus,
in terr√¶ felicis, tot sanctis postea frequentand√¶ veluti
possessionem auspicat√≤ venit. Proxima infantibus
sacro lavandis fonte cura est data, quorum nonnulli,
post susceptum salutis sacramentum, ad terram viventium
possidendam, quasi gentis totius nomine, demigrarunt.
Puellam annos natam novem, oppressam
gravi morbo, parentes abjecerant. Cum enim artis
medic√¶ prorsus ignara natio sit, √¶grotos facile desperat,
neque cibo, aut curatione ulla, juvat. Depositam
Patres √† parentibus postularunt, ut expiarent lympha
salutari. Ultro illis permissa est, quippe qu√¶ instar
mortui canis haberetur. Abductam in mapale separatum
curavere sedulo: edoctam, quantum erat
necesse; baptizatam, ac nona post luce mortuam, c&oelig;lo
intulerunt. Eadem Sociorum caritas l√¶tiorem exitum
in juvene sortita est. Ejus pater Membertous,
primus omnium, uti narrant, barbarorum, cum √® Gallia
navigatum illuc fuit, in Christianorum numerum
venerat; homo strenuus, &amp; omnium popularium testimonio,
212
ceteris long√® pr√¶stans animi robore, belli
scientia, clientelarum multitudine, &amp; gloriosi claritudine
cognominis; quippe Magni Imperatoris titulum
publico suffragio consecutus. Hunc obtinebat locum
Membertous inter Souriquios, qui Acadiam, circa
ostia Laurentiani amnis, incolunt. Ejus filium difficili
√¶gritudine conflictatum P. Biardus invisit. Miratur
nihil triste in tugurio; non planctum, non flebiles
n√¶nias: imo epulum, choream, &amp; duos tresve canes
alligatos. Qu√¶rit quid h√¶c sibi velint. Respondent
juvenem brevi esse moriturum, amicos vocatos: illis
epulum parari: funebrem choream postea ducendam:
canes, quos videbat, interficiendos, placandis mortui
Manibus. Exclamavit Pater nequaquam ista Christianis
hominibus convenire, &amp; impias consuetudines
graviter increpuit. Senior, adolescentis parens, ignorantiam
excusavit; ceterum se ac filium in ipsius
esse potestate; doceret, juberet, imperata facturos.
Sacerdos vetuit ne canes interficerentur: saltatores
importunos amandavit: epuli partem, qu√¶ superstitionis
habere nihil videbatur, permisit: in primis
autem, ne deponeretur penitus √¶groti cura prohibuit;
imo suasit ut ad Gallorum domicilia, quamvis long√®
disjuncta, deportaretur; sperare se, favente Deo,
futurum ut convalesceret. Benign√® auditus est √†
Membertoo: delatus √¶ger ad nos fuit, ridentibus, ac
bolum tantum tam subito √® faucibus ereptum sibi dolentibus
veneficis, &amp; circulatoribus, quorum sententi√¢
conclamatus adolescens vivere posse negabatur. Ac
214
sane agebat animam, c√πm triduo post ad Gallorum
domicilia pervenit, fractus itinere ac morbo. Patrum
tamen arte ac studio, &amp; scilicet Dei benignitate, recreatus
est; nec ipse tantum in fide catholica confirmatus,
sed ejus capessend√¶ desiderio complures inflammati.

Incidit aliquanto post in morbum pater adolescentis,
&amp; ad nos similiter deferri voluit, ubi nostrum in
tugurium, atque adeo in unius √® Patribus lectum

207
BEGINNING AND FIRST FRUITS OF THE CANADIAN
MISSION.

THE French had, since the year 1524, often visited
the coasts of America opposite to France, but
cursorily, and, as it were, while passing by.
Finally, at the beginning of the last century, Samuel
Champlain, who well deserves to be called the parent
of the Canadian colony, entered the region of the interior.
Already was the undertaking progressing very
favorably, when Henry IV., more solicitous for religion
than for commerce, resolved, in the year 1608, to
introduce Christian rites into this part of the new
World, and asked members of the Society to undertake
this Apostolic enterprise. Upon being informed
of the plan of the King, and ordered to choose as
soon as possible energetic priests who would lay
solidly the foundations of so great a work, Father
Coton, the confessor of the king, informed the Commander
of the Society. From the whole number,
not only of youths but also of old men, who sought
this laborious Duty, there were chosen Father Peter
Biard, of Grenoble, a professor of theology in the
college of Lyons, and Father Enemond Mass√©, of
Lyons. The unforeseen death of the King delayed
this auspicious enterprise, and diminished the enthusiasm
of the friends of the Society, who were providing
a ship and other necessaries for the voyage. But
the pious Coton, unconquered by adversity, brought
in the authority of the Queen, in order that he might
overcome the difficulties in his way. As a result, the
time was set for their departure, and the Fathers hastened
209
to Dieppe, in order that they might sail thence
for New France. But, lo! suddenly an unexpected
obstacle. Their ship belonged to Poutrincourt, a
French nobleman; it was, however, subject to the
control of two Calvinistic merchants, since they had
incurred no light expense toward providing her with
equipments. As soon as they heard that members of
the Society were to be embarked upon her, they refused
to allow her to leave the port. The authority
of the Queen was invoked; her commands were reiterated.
They answered that they would not refuse admission
to any other sort of priests, but that they
were unwilling to have anything to do with our men.
When Coton saw that the stubbornness of the rascals
could not be overcome, he approached the matter by
another way. There was a lady distinguished not
less for piety than for birth, Antoinette de Guercheville.
This woman was as solicitous for the interests
of the Mission as for her own; and since she had
acquired an uncommon influence among many, because
of her reputation for integrity, she quickly collected
a large sum of money, by means of which the
heretical merchants were repaid the amount which
they had spent in equipping the ship. So, although
the merchants were disappointed and unwilling, the
Fathers were admitted. But, because of the intervening
delay, they did not sail until the 26th of January,
when the storms of winter caused a raging sea. On
this account the voyage was of four months' duration,
although ordinarily of two, and was terrible because
of disease within and tempests without. Having entered
at last the mouth of the St. Lawrence river on
the 22nd day of May, on the holy day of Pentecost,
they came upon some traces of the Christian religion,
which had been superficially impressed by those
211
whom we have mentioned as having journeyed from
France into this region. For, since the speech of the
people was unknown [322] to them, and they had no
certain and fixed residence in this savage land, there
was no opportunity for educating those whom they
chanced to baptize, and who, plunging again into
their former habits, scarcely retained the Christian
name, while defiling it with their native vices. The
first concern of the Fathers was to build a chapel, to
learn the language of the country, and to instruct the
Frenchmen who had emigrated from old to new
France. A solemn Thanksgiving was enjoined; the
figure of Christ, covered with a canopy, was carried
about with the greatest possible ceremony; and he
came auspiciously into the possession, so to speak, of
the happy land afterwards to be frequented by so many
holy men. Next, attention was given to laving the
infants in the sacred font, of whom some, after receiving
the sacrament of salvation, departed to their
homes in the land of the immortals, in the name, as
it were, of the whole race. A girl aged nine years,
afflicted with a grievous disease, had been abandoned
by her parents. For, since the race is altogether
ignorant of the art of medicine, they readily despair
of the sick, and neither provide them with food nor
care for them in any way. The Fathers asked her
parents to give them the forsaken child, in order that
they might sanctify her with the water of salvation.
She was readily handed over to them; and naturally,
inasmuch as she was considered no better than a dead
dog. Taking her apart to their hut they gave her assiduous
care; she was baptized, and, dying on the
ninth day afterward, they introduced her into Heaven.
The same charity of the Associates resulted more fortunately
in the case of a young boy. His father was
213
Membertou, who, they say, in the early days of navigation
thither from France, first of all the savages
became a Christian; he was an energetic man, and,
according to the testimony of all his countrymen, far
excelled others in vigor of mind, in knowledge of
war, in number of dependents, and the distinction of
a glorious name, for by public vote he had acquired
the title of "Great Chief." This position Membertou
held among the Souriquois, who inhabit Acadia
about the mouth of the St. Lawrence river. Father
Biard visited Membertou's son, who was suffering
from a dangerous illness. He was surprised that
there was no grief in the wigwam; no lamentations,
no tearful dirges; instead, a feast, a dance, and two
or three dogs fastened together. He asked what
these things meant. They answered that the youth
would die in a short time; that the friends had been
invited, and for them the banquet was being prepared;
that afterwards a funeral dance was to be conducted;
and that the dogs which he saw were to be
killed to appease the Spirit of the dead boy. The
Father exclaimed that these things were quite unfitting
for Christian men, and severely censured the
impious custom. The parent of the youth excused
his ignorance; he said that henceforth he and his son
should be under the Father's direction; he begged
him to instruct and command them, and said that
they would execute his orders. The Priest forbade
the killing of the dogs; he dismissed the rude dancers;
a part of the repast he allowed, as not devoted to superstitious
rites. He insisted that the patient should
no longer be neglected; still more, he persuaded them
that the boy should be taken to the dwellings of the
French, although these were far distant, saying that
he hoped, by the favor of God, for his recovery. The
215
priest was favorably heard by Membertou; the patient
was brought to us, although the sorcerers and medicine-men,
who declared that the unhappy youth could
not live, ridiculed this decision, and grieved that such
a morsel should be snatched suddenly from their jaws.
And indeed he was at the point of death, when, three
days afterward, exhausted by the journey, and by
sickness, he arrived at the French settlement. Nevertheless,
by the skill and devotion of the Fathers,
and by the kindness of God, he was restored; nor was
he alone established in the Catholic faith, but many
of his countrymen were inflamed with the desire of
adopting it.

Some time afterward, the father of the young man
fell sick, and wished to be also brought to us, where,
after being received into our hut and even into the
bed of one of the Fathers, he piously departed this
life; and, what was novel and displeasing to the savages,
he was buried among Christian people; for they
themselves are very reluctant to be separated from
the tombs of their ancestors. His funeral was observed,
as far as the limitations of the case permitted,
with marked ceremony. Nor was this savage's virtue
unworthy in any respect of that honor; for, even before
he had learned of Christ, he could not be induced
to marry more than one wife, considering this more
in harmony with nature and reason. But, after his
acceptance of the Faith of Christ, he so lived that he
was to the savages an object of admiration, to the
Christians an example.

These things were accomplished at home. Then
going forth, as it were, from the city walls, the
heralds of the Gospel traversed a great part of the
country. A godly act was performed whenever opportunity
allowed; hands were laid upon the sick;
217
parents and children were conciliated by means of
little gifts; services were rendered to the French who
were establishing new homes; nor were the seamen
and ships' passengers neglected. There was not
lacking a glad harvest for their patience. Meanwhile,
so great a scarcity of provisions existed, that for
each week [323] a ration was allotted, so scanty that it
was hardly sufficient for one day; namely, ten ounces
of bread, half a pound of salted meat, and a handful
of peas or beans. In addition to this, each man was
his own mechanic, mender, miller, cook, hewer of
wood, and drawer of water. There occurred sometimes
to the Fathers, in the midst of the miseries, the
words of those to whom Moses had given the task of
reconnoitering Canaan:Num. c. 13, 14.
This land ... devoureth
its inhabitants; ... there we saw certain monsters of
the sons of Enac of the Giant-kind: in comparison of whom,
we seemed like locusts. But at the same time there came
into mind the speech of Joshua and of Caleb, full of
divine trust: The land which we have gone round is very
good. If the Lord be favorable, he will bring us into it....
Fear ye not the people of this land, ... the Lord
is with us.

DOMICILIA SOCIETATIS &amp; MISSIONES IN NOVA
FRANCIA.

ET esse cum servis suis, ac militibus Dominum,
exitus comprobavit. Nam hoc anno MDCCIII.
ineunte, cum h√¶c scribimus, pr√¶ter Quebecense
collegium, numerantur in hac terra deserta prius &amp;
invia triginta &amp; amplius florentissim√¶ cultissim√¶que
Missiones nostr√¶ Societatis. Prima in conspectu Quebeci,
decimo ab urbe lapide, Lauretana dicitur. Altera
in pago Tadussaco sedet: ad ripam fluvii Laurentiani,
leucis infra Quebecum LX. versus ortum. Tres
ali√¶ supra Quebecum ipsum, longe procurrunt in Boream,
circa lacum S. Joannis: una in eo loco, qui √†
septem insulis nomen habet; altera, in pago Chigoutimino;
tertia, secus amnem Saguen√¶um. Excoluntur
ibi Montagn√¶i, Papinachii, Mistassini, &amp; ali√¶ passim
gentes errabund√¶. Jam, si versus obeuntis solis
partes &amp; fluminis Laurentiani fontem tendas, occurret
in ejus rip√¢ septentrionali pagus Trium fluminum
dictus, quia ibi tria qu√¶dam flumina confluunt: abest
Quebeco septem octove dierum iter. Florebat illic
Algonkinorum Missio longe pulcherrima, sed hanc
vinum igne vaporatum &amp; stillatum, √† mercatoribus
Europ√¶is, facilem inde qu√¶stum male captantibus
invectum, vehementer labefactavit inducta ebrietate.
Pensat h√¶c damna virtus ac pietas Abnakisorum.
220
Triplex apud illos statio collocata una Quebeco non
procul, in XLVI. gradu latitudinis, nomine S. Francisci
Salesii &amp; patrocinio insignita: ali√¶ du√¶ sunt remotiores;
loco nomen est Nipisikouit. Trans amnem
Laurentianum ad Meridiem funduntur Iroqu√¶orum
quinque nationes. Septem sunt apud illos pr√¶conum
Evangelii domicilia, per centum quinquaginta leucas
sparsa. Ex iis sex profligata fuerant bello Gallos
inter &amp; Iroqu√¶os conflato circa annum MDCLXXXII.
Revocata cum religione pax anno MDCCII. omnia
priorem in statum restituit. In iis Iroqu√¶orum Missionibus
ea pr√¶cipu√® floret, qu√¶ √† S. Francisco Xaverio
nomen habet, ad Montem-Regalem.

Supra Iroqu√¶os, versus occasum &amp; Aquilonem,
intra quadragesimum gradum &amp; XLV. cernere est
majores duos lacus angusto freto junctos: alter, isque
amplior, Ilin√¶orum; alter Huronum dicitur. Hos
ingens terr√¶ lingua dividit, cujus in apice sedet Missio
S. Ignatii, sive Missilimakinacana. Supra duos istos
lacus tertius est, ambobus major, quem superiorem
lacum appellant. Hujus in aditu constituta est Missio
S. Mari√¶ √† Saltu. Interjectum inter hunc, &amp; binos
inferiores lacus spatium occupant Outaouaki, apud
quos plurima stativa Societas habet. Ejusmodi arces
religionis (sic enim appellare Missiones licet) unde
suos profert milites, &amp; sacra explicat vexilla, tres
circa lacum Ilin√¶orum posit√¶ sunt, prima inter Puteatamisos:
Missio Sancti Josephi nuncupatur: altera
inter Kikarousos, Maskoutensos, &amp; Outagamisos; S.
222
Francisci Xaverii nomen obtinet: tertia inter Oumiamisos,
Angeli Custodis. Infra memoratos lacus,
supra ipsam Floridam, vastissimos pererrant campos
Ilin√¶i. Ibi amplissima statio, cui nomen ab immaculata
Virginis Matris conceptione impositum, tres in
Missiones secatur, &amp; ad fluvium usque Missisipum
procurrit. Insidet ejusdem fluminis ripis missio Baiogulana,
in trigesimo primo gradu latitudinis: demum
ultima protenditur secundum eundem amnem versus
Mexicanum sinum. H√¶c visum est enucleare paulo
distinctius, &amp; quasi sub uno statim aspectu ponere, ut
intelligatur qu√≤ singula referenda sint, qu√¶ postea de
Nova Francia narrabuntur.

Restat ignota Europ√¶is adhuc pars Canad√¶ immensa,
ultra Missisipum fluvium, clementiori subjecta
c&oelig;lo, frequens incolis, armentis frugibusque l√¶ta;
vit√¶ ver√¶ ac salutis expers. H√¶c generosos Christi
milites vocat. Nec non altera [324] longe isti dissimilis,
qu√¶ rigidis circa Hudsonium finum, √† gradu
LV. ad LX. aut LXX. subjecta septentrionibus, nivibus
ac pruinis demersa, tanto √¶qui√πs implorat opem,
quanto gravioribus incommodis conflictatur. Hic
Societas ante annos paucos prima c&oelig;pit figere vestigia.
Illucescet illa, spero, dies, cum obvallatum
periculis ac laboribus iter eadem perrumpet. Non sine
magno molimine claustra Tartari, oppressas injusta
servitute animas retinentis, perfringuntur; neque illa
ipsa, tot florens modo coloniis, Missio Canadica statim
suam est maturitatem adepta. √Ügr√® per sexdecim
224
annos tanquam in salebris h√¶sit, nec suam quandam
nacta formam est, nisi anno seculi superioris quinto
&amp; vigesimo, c√πm se aliquando ex illis angustiis explicuit,
P. Petri Cotoni, cui sua debebat primordia, beneficio,
ut sexta Pars Histori√¶ fusius exponet.

Nunc √¶rumnarum ac periculorum plenos natales
referimus laborios√¶ Missionis, qu√¶ vix nata, in ipsis
cunis per Anglos propemod√πm extincta est.

SETTLEMENTS AND MISSIONS OF THE SOCIETY IN
NEW FRANCE.

AND that the Lord is with his servants and soldiers,
the outcome has proved. For, in the beginning
of this year 1703, while we are writing these
things, there are numbered in this formerly solitary and
unexplored country more than thirty very prosperous
and well-equipped Missions of our Society, besides
the college of Quebec. The first of these, in sight of
Quebec, at the tenth mile-stone from the city, is called
Lorette. Another is situated in the district of
Tadoussac, on the shore of the river St. Lawrence,
sixty leagues below Quebec toward the east. Three
others, above Quebec itself, extend far into the North
about lake St. John; one in that place which takes its
name from the seven islands;49 another in the district
of Chigoutimini;50 the third on the Saguenay
river. There they minister to the Montagnais, the
Papinachois, the Mistassins, and other wandering
tribes. Now, if you journey towards the regions of
the setting sun, and the source of the St. Lawrence
river, you will find upon its northern bank a district
called Three rivers, because there three rivers flow
together: it is distant from Quebec seven or eight
days' journey. Here, there formerly flourished the
most successful Mission of the Algonquins; but it has
been much weakened through the drunkenness induced
by brandy, brought in by European merchants
who thus wickedly derive an easy profit. But these
losses are compensated by the virtue and piety of the
Abenakis. Among them a mission of three stations
221
has been established; one located among them, not
far from Quebec, on the forty-sixth parallel of latitude,
distinguished by the name and patronage of St.
Francis de Sales: the other two are more remote, at a
place named Nipisikouit. Across the St. Lawrence
river, to the South, extend the five nations of the Iroquois.
There are among them seven stations of the
Evangelists, scattered through a hundred and fifty
leagues. Of these, six were destroyed in the war
which arose between the French and Iroquois, about
the year 1682. Peace, together with the recall of
the missionaries, in the year 1702 restored all things
to their previous condition.51 Among these Missions
of the Iroquois, that one is especially flourishing
which is named for St. Francis Xavier, at Montreal.52


Above the Iroquois, toward the west and North,
between the fortieth and forty-fifth parallels, one may
see two great lakes joined by a narrow strait; the
larger one is called the lake of the Ilinois,53 the other
the lake of the Hurons.54 These are separated by
a large peninsula, at the point of which is situated the
Mission of St. Ignatius, or Missilimakinac.55 Above
these two lakes there is a third, greater than either,
called lake superior. At the entrance of this lake
has been established the Mission of Ste. Marie at the
Sault.56 The space between this and two smaller
lakes is occupied by the Outaouaki, among whom
the Society has many stations. Three such citadels
of religion (for thus it is proper to call the Missions),
whence she leads forth her soldiers and unfurls her
sacred standards, have been located about the lake
of the Ilinois: the first, among the Puteatamis, and
called the Mission of St. Joseph; another, among the
Kikarous, Maskoutens, and Outagamies, and possessing
the name of St. Francis Xavier:57 the third,
223
among the Oumiamis,58 has the name of the Guardian
Angel. Below the lakes which have been mentioned,
above Florida, the Ilinois roam through most extensive
territories. There, a very large station, named
from the immaculate conception of the Virgin Mother,
is divided into three Missions, and extends as far
as the river Mississippi. Upon the banks of the
same river is situated the mission of Baiogula, at the
thirty-first parallel of latitude;59 and it extends down
that stream towards the gulf of Mexico. It has
seemed best to explain these matters somewhat fully,
because the individual facts here specified will be referred
to in what is to be hereafter narrated concerning
New France.

There remains unknown to Europeans, up to the
present time, an immense portion of Canada, beyond
the Mississippi river, situated beneath a milder sky,
well-inhabited, and abounding in animal and vegetable
life; the whole, deprived of true life and of salvation.
This region calls to the generous soldiers of
Christ. So is it, likewise, [324] with another region
far dissimilar to that, around the frozen Hudson bay,
from the fifty-fifth parallel to the sixtieth or seventieth;
lying at the north, plunged in snows and
frosts, it even more justly implores aid, as it is
afflicted by more weighty ills. Here the Society, a
few years ago, first began to plant its footsteps.
That day will dawn, I hope, when it shall break
through the barriers of dangers and toils. Not
without great exertion are the gates of Tartarus,
which hold burdened souls in unmerited bondage,
broken down; nor did the Canadian Mission itself,
now flourishing with so many settlements, all at once
attain its full development. Grievously, through
sixteen years did it, so to speak, stick in a rough
225
road; indeed, it did not take shape until 1625, when
it was extricated from its perplexities by the aid of
Father Peter Coton, to whom it owed its origin, as
the sixth Part of this History will more fully explain.

Now we return to the natal days, full of hardships
and dangers, of the toilsome Mission, which, scarcely
born, was almost exterminated in its cradle by the
English.

THE CANADIAN MISSION DRIVEN OUT BY THE ENGLISH.

TO OUR COMRADES residing in that place there
had come as a reinforcement, on the 15th day of
May, 1613, Father Quentin and Brother Gilbert
du Thet, provided with a royal commission, by which
they were empowered to establish a new settlement in
a suitable location.60 They found the French intent
upon founding a city, and unaware of the danger
which threatened. The English, a few years before,
had occupied Virginia. This eastern coast-region of
North America, situated between Florida and New
France, is comprised between the thirty-sixth and
thirty-eighth parallels. While the English were
sailing thither in the summer months of the year
1613, and, having lost their bearings and strayed
from their course, on account of the fogs, which
usually are very heavy upon this sea in the summer,
they were gradually borne to the shore where the
French had settled,61 not far from the port of St.
Sauveur. When they learned that a French ship
was stationed there, they made ready their weapons
and entered the harbor. Meanwhile the French,
uncertain whether they should consider as friends
or foes those whom the wind was bearing directly
towards their position, tremblingly awaited the outcome.
Who they were was soon apparent. The
English attacked the French ship,62 wherein few
were drawn up in defense&mdash;for the others had departed
to work on the buildings&mdash;and with no
trouble captured her.

UNUS √à SOCIETATE INTERFICITUR; ALII CANADA
EJICIUNTUR.

PRIMO in conflictu Gilbertus Thetus, domestic√¶
rei adiutor √® Societate, confossus lethali plaga,
postridie religiosa morte occubuit. Ceteri Patres
qui stabant in littore, in potestatem Argalli,
pr√¶toris Angli, venerunt. Ille, dum Gallic√¶ navis
pr√¶dam &amp; supellectilem recenset, subduxit clam √®
Sauss√¶ii, navis Gallic√¶ gubernatoris, qui huic expeditioni
pr√¶erat, scrinio regium diploma, cujus fide tota
nov√¶ coloni√¶ ratio nitebatur. Mox ipsum Sauss√¶ium
√® littore subeuntem adortus, qu√¶rit ex eo quo jure,
cujus auctoritate, novas tam prope Virginiam sedes
moliatur. Laudavit Sauss√¶ius regium diploma, quod
se in capsis rite conscriptum habere dixit. Ad eas
ubi ventum est, vidit integras, &amp; obseratas, suisque
omnia digesta locis agnovit, diploma nullum apparuit.
Tum Argallus, vultu &amp; voce ad severitatem
compositis, fugitivos &amp; pr√¶dones conclamat, ac necem
commeruisse pronunciat, simulque navim suis diripiendam
tradit. Illum interea Patres obsecrant ut
victis benign√® consulat, quibus objici nihil nox√¶ possit
aliud, qu√†m quod in pacato solo fuerint nimium securi:
auctoritatem Regis Galli√¶ non dubiam ac voluntatem
testantur. Pr√¶tor prob√® sibi conscius vera
narrari, comiter eos audivit, &amp; omnibus potestatem
230
in Galliam redeundi fecit. Duas in naviculas infelix
turba imponitur, quarum una cursum in Galliam
rect√† dirigeret; altera cum aliquot Anglis solveret in
Virginiam, inde Franciam petitura. Hanc PP. Biardus
&amp; Quintinus, illam P. Mass√¶us, &amp; Sauss√¶ius conscenderunt.
Utriusque sors long√® dispar fuit. Qu√¶
Sauss√¶ium &amp; P. Mass√¶um vehebat dum oram maritimam
legit, annon√¢, nautis, armamentis destituta, incidit
in geminas naves reditum in Galliam adornantes.
Jungit se illis l√¶ta, cumque suis vectoribus Maclovium,
Britanni√¶ Aremoric√¶ oppidum, paucis diebus
tenuit.

Interim Argallus, classis Anglic√¶ pr√¶fectus, Patres
Biardum &amp; Quintinum deducturus in Virginiam,
ut constitutum fuerat, paululum iis pr√¶ivit cum sua
navi pr√¶toria. Virginiam obtinebat Anglus ferox,
nomini Gallico, ac Societati nostr√¶ [325] perinfensus.
Ubi adventare Jesuitas audivit, vociferatur perdendos
homines improbissimos, busta pietatis ac religionis.
Argallus contra nitebatur; seque vivo nihil molesti√¶
damnive Patribus inferendum affirmabat: hanc enim
ipsis dederat fidem; &amp; regium diploma, cujus auctoritate
colonia Gallica in Novam Franciam deducebatur,
protulit. Hoc diplomate inflammatus homo furiosus,
exturbandos √® Nova Francia Gallos clamat. In hanc
sententiam Angli proceres iverunt. Jubetur Argallus
viam remetiri; Gallos, quicumque superessent, ejicere,
domicilia evertere, &amp; √¶quare solo. Rediit: arces in
ora Canadensi extructas incendit, omnia delevit, ac
232
naves duas in Regio Portu deprehensas, invasit.

Dum h√¶c in Canada geruntur, naves Anglic√¶,
pr√¶euntem Argallum secut√¶, ali√¶ procul √† Virginia
ventorum vi abrept√¶; ali√¶ undis haust√¶ sunt. Una,
cui Turnellus Anglus pr√¶erat, &amp; qua Patres Quintinus
ac Biardus vehebantur, continentibus sexdecim
dierum procellis vexata, in Azores, Lusitanorum ad
Afric√¶ littus insulas, celerrim√® defertur. Hic vero
novum exoritur periculum. Turnellus p&oelig;nam metuens,

229
ONE OF THE MEMBERS OF THE SOCIETY IS KILLED; THE
OTHERS ARE EXPELLED FROM CANADA.

IN THE FIRST onset, Gilbert du Thet, a household
assistant of the Society, was stricken with a mortal
wound, and on the following day piously departed
this life. The rest of the Fathers, who were standing
on the shore, were captured by Argall, the English
commander.63 This man, while he was taking
an inventory of the plunder and equipment of the
French ship, surreptitiously removed from the
trunk of Saussaye, the captain of the French vessel,
and commander of the expedition, the royal commission
upon whose authority all the proceedings of
the new colony were based. Soon meeting Saussaye
himself, returning from the shore, Argall asked him
by what right, by whose authority, he was founding
a new colony so near Virginia. Saussaye cited the
royal commission, which he asserted that he had,
duly drawn up, in one of his trunks. When they
came to these, he saw them untouched and locked,
and all things disposed in their proper places; but
no commission appeared. Thereupon Argall, changing
his countenance and voice to severity, pronounced
them runaways and pirates, and declared
that they deserved death; while at the same time
he delivered over the ship to his men to be plundered.
Meanwhile the Fathers besought him to
adopt mild measures toward the vanquished, against
whom no other fault could be charged than that, in
a peaceful situation, they had been too careless;
they testified that the authority and favor of the
231
King of France had certainly been given to the
colony. The captain, who was thoroughly conscious
of the truth of their statements, listened to them
kindly, and gave to all the opportunity of returning
to France. The unhappy crowd was placed upon
two small ships, one of which directed its course
straight towards France; the other, with some of the
English, sailed for Virginia, thence to depart for
France. Fathers Biard and Quentin embarked upon
the latter; Father Mass√© and Saussaye upon the
former. The fortunes of these ships were widely
diverse. While that which carried Saussaye and
Father Mass√© was coasting along the shore, destitute
of provisions, of seamen, and of equipment, she fell
upon two ships preparing to return to France. She
gladly joined herself to these, and, with her passengers,
arrived in a few days at St. Malo, a town of
Brittany.

Meanwhile Argall, the commander of the English
fleet, in order that he might conduct Fathers Biard
and Quentin to Virginia, as had been resolved upon,
preceded them a little with his flag-ship. Virginia
was then ruled by a ferocious Englishman,64 who was
extremely hostile to the French name and to our
Society. [325] When he heard that Jesuits had arrived,
he exclaimed that such extremely wicked men,
the sepulchers of piety and religion, ought to be destroyed.
Argall strove against him, and declared
that, while he lived, no annoyance or injury should
be offered to the Fathers, for he had given them
this assurance; and he produced the royal commission,
by authority of which the French colony was
brought to New France. Incensed by this commission,
the man declared in a rage that the French
must be driven from New France. In this decision
233
the English councilors agreed. Argall was ordered
to retrace his path; to expel those of the French
who remained; to destroy their buildings, and level
them with the ground. He returned, burned the
forts built upon the Canadian coast, destroyed everything,
and seized two ships which he found at Port
Royal.65

While these things were taking place in Canada,
of the English ships which were following the lead
of Argall some were driven far from Virginia by the
violence of the wind; others were swamped by the
waves. One, which the Englishman Turnell66 commanded,
and in which Fathers Quentin and Biard
were being conveyed, after being driven continuously
for sixteen days by tempests, was quickly
borne to the Azores, islands on the coast of Africa
belonging to the Portuguese. But here a new
danger arose. Turnell, fearing punishment because
he was carrying with him and was holding under
unjust conditions priests of the Society, who had
been torn from their homes and robbed with the
greatest brutality, began to consider plans for making
way with them. Finally it seemed better to him
to take refuge in their clemency and mildness, which
he had observed amid the most grievous injuries.
Nevertheless, he took measures that they should
not enter the port, thinking that while the ship stood
at anchor he might procure the necessary provisions
by sending in a small boat. The contrary to what
he had expected happened. For, impelled by an inshore
breeze, he entered the harbor, although unwillingly
and reluctantly. Our friends, contrary to
his deserts, interposed not even a word by which he
might be accused, rejoicing because they had, in this
manner, saved an enemy. The English captain recognized
235
their kindness, and afterwards often spoke
with great praise of the Fathers. But this he did
much more unreservedly when, borne by a storm to
Pembroke, a city of England, he was suspected by
the officials of that town of piracy on the high seas,
because he was sailing in a French ship and produced
no written authority by which he might justify his
voyage. When he asserted that he had been separated
by a storm from his commander, Argall, no credence
was given to him. In this crisis he mentioned
as witnesses the two priests of the Society whom he
had in the ship, and whose uncorrupted integrity
could be doubted by no one. When the Fathers,
on being questioned, had given assurance that the
affair was thus, he was released from danger. He
made the requital which was due to their kindness,
and took care that they should not only suffer no
harm, but even that they should be shown honor by
the officials. Meantime the ambassador of the Most
Christian King, upon being informed of the toilsome
voyage of the Fathers, carried on negotiations with
the King of England concerning their restoration to
France. With his consent, they arrived, in the tenth
month after their capture, joyfully and safely among
their Brethren at Amiens.

seu barbarorum Nov√¶ Franci√¶.

FLUMINA NOV√Ü FRANCI√Ü; SOLI NATURA; FER√Ü, PISCES, AVES, &amp; C.

DUO sunt in Nova Francia majores fluvii. Unus
ab indigenis Canada nominatus, &amp; √† quo tota
regio nomen traxit, nunc fluvius Sancti Laurentii
dicitur, &amp; ab occasu in ortum amplissimo fluit
alveo. Alter, cui nomen Missisipus, per vasta, &amp; ignota
magnam adhuc partem, terrarum spatia fertur
√† Septentrione in Meridiem. Habent hoc singulare
hujus regionis fluvii, qu√≤d certis in locis ex editiore
solo pr√¶cipitant in humiliorem planitiem ingenti
cum strepitu. Ea loca saltus vocant Franci. Catadupa
recte dixeris, qualia in Nilo celebrantur. Aqua
tota fluminis, in morem arcuati fornicis, ita s√¶pe cadit,
ut infra suspensum alt√® amnem sicco vestigio transire
liceat. Barbari, cum huc ventum est, suas naviculas,
√® levi compactas cortice, imponunt humeris,
&amp; in placidam fluminis, alveo depressiore fluentis,
partem eas deportant, cum sarcinulis. Urbs nov√¶
Franci√¶ primaria Kebecum nuncupatur, S. Laurentii
fluvio imposita. C&oelig;lo salubri tota regio utitur; at hyeme
frigida, &amp; diuturna vexatur. Hanc efficit partim
fluminum &amp; lacuum crebritas; partim opacitas &amp; amplitudo
246
nemorum, qu√¶ vim solis calidam infringunt;
denique nivium copia, quibus terra tres quatuorve
menses, in iis locis qu√¶ ab Boream propius accedunt,
&amp; eidem ac vetus Gallia parallelo subjacent, continenter
inhorrescit. Humus omnium arborum plantarumque
feracissima, pr√¶sertim ubi excis√¶ silv√¶
locum cultur√¶ majorem pr√¶buerunt. Quadrupedes
e√¶dem, qu√¶ in Europa: nonnull√¶ regionis propri√¶
sunt, ut alces. Magnam belluam indigen√¶ appellant.
Id nominis invenit √† mole corporis: bovem enim
√¶quat magnitudine. Mulum capite refert; cervum
cornibus, pedibus, &amp; cauda. Eam canibus immissis
barbari agitant; defatigatam conficiunt jaculis &amp;
missilibus. Si desunt venatici canes, ipsi vicem illorum
obeunt. Per medias quippe nives incredibili
celeritate gradiuntur, ac ne corporis pondus vestigia
pedum altius in nivem deprimat, substernunt plantis,
inseruntque pedibus, lata reticula, illis simillima,
quibus pilam lusores vulg√≤ pulsant. H√¶c reticula,
spatium nivis ac soli satis magnum amplexa, currentes
facile sustinent. Alces vero crura exilia defigens
alte in nivem, √¶gr√® se expedit. Illius carnibus vescuntur,
teguntur pelle, ungula posterioris sinistri
pedis sanantur. Huic ungul√¶ mira qu√¶dam &amp; multiplex
virtus inest, medicorum celeberrimorum testimonio
commendata. Valet in primis adversus morbum
comitialem, sive admoveatur pectori, qua parte
cor micat; sive indatur pal√¶ annuli, quem digitus
l√¶v√¶ minimo proximus gestet; sive demum teneatur
248
in ejusdem sinistr√¶ vola, in pugnum contracta. Nec
minorem vim habet ad sanandam pleuritidem, capitis
vertigines, &amp; sexcentos alios, si credimus expertis,
morbos.

Alterum animantis genus illic notissimum &amp; frequentissimum
est fiber, cujus pelle, cum Europ√¶is
mercibus mutanda, commercii Canadensis ratio fere
tota constat. Color castane√¶ colorem imitatur; modus
cor[po]ris idem, qui exigui vervecis: curti pedes
&amp; ad natandum compositi, nam in aquis perinde ac in
terra degit; cauda glabra, crassa &amp; plana, qu√¶ natanti
pro gubernaculo sit: dentes duo, majores ceteris, ex
ore utrimque prominent: iis tanquam gladio &amp; serra
utuntur fibri ad arbores exscindendas, cum domos
extruunt; in iis enim fabricandis mira pollent industria.
Eas ponunt ad lacuum fluviorumve ripas:
muros √® stipitibus componunt, interjecto cespite uliginoso
ac tenaci, calcis instar; vix ut multa vi effringi
opus &amp; convelli possit. Tota cas√¶ fabrica variis contignationibus
distinguitur: infima √® transversis lignis
crassioribus constat, instratis desuper ramis, ac relicto
foramine &amp; ostiolo, per quod in fluvium subire,
cum videtur, possint: H√¶c modice supra fluminis
aquam exstat, ali√¶ assurgunt altius, in easque, si fluvius
intumescens imum tabulatum vicerit, se receptant.
In una √® superioribus contignationibus cubant;
pr√¶bet molle stratum alga siccior, &amp; arborum muscus,
quo se tutantur a frigore; in altera penum habent, &amp;
provisa in hyemem cibaria. √Üdificium fornicato
250
tecto clauditur. Sic hyemem exigunt: nam √¶state,
opacum in ripis frigus captant, aut undis immersi calores
√¶stivos fugiunt. In una s√¶pe domo ingens,
&amp; multorum capitum familia stabulatur. Quod si loci
premuntur angustiis, discedunt juniores ultro, &amp; sua
sibi domicilia moliuntur. In eam curam incumbunt
sub prima autumni frigora, &amp; mutuas sibi invicem
operas commodant, tum ad secanda ligna, tum ad
comportanda, ita ut plures uni eidemque succedant
oneri, &amp; ingentia ramalia, nemorisque stragem, devehant.
Si quem fluvium nanciscuntur ad suos accommodatum
usus, non tamen satis alto gurgite, struunt
aggerem coercendis aquis, donec ad idoneam altitudinem
assurgant. Ac primo quidem arbores grandiores
arrodendo dejiciunt: deinde transversas ab una ripa
ducunt ad alteram. Duplicem versum &amp; ordinem arborum
faciunt; relicto inter illas obliqu√® sic positas
spatio sex fere pedum, quod referciunt c√¶mentis, argilla,
ramis, tam solerter, nihil ut perfectius √† summo
architecto expectes. Operis longitudo major minorve
est, pro fluvii, quem coercere volunt, modo. Ducen√ªm
aliquando passuum ejusmodi aggeres reperti. At,
si amnis plus justo intumescit, diffringunt aliquam
molis partem, ac tantum emittunt aqu√¶, quantum satis
videtur.

Ut feris silv√¶, sic piscibus abundant flumina. Unus
est in Iroqu√¶orum lacu, de quo nihil √† priscis legitur
proditum scriptoribus. Causarus ab indigenis
vocatur: octo pedes longus, aliquando decem. Crassitudo,
252
humani femoris; color leucoph√¶us, candido
tamen propior; squamis totus horret tam duris, tamque
valid√® consertis, ut aciem pugionis, &amp; hastilium,
excludant. Caput amplum, &amp; cranio pr√¶duro, tanquam
casside, munitum. Hinc piscis armati nomen
illi √† Gallis inditum. Et vero perpetua cum aliis
piscibus bella gerit, quorum exitio pascitur. Pro
telo rostrum immane gerit, humani brachii longitudine,
gemino dentium ordine instructum. Hoc venabulo
non solum reliquos mactat pisces, verum etiam
avibus, cum mutare dapes cupit, insidiatur &amp; illudit.
Eam ob rem occultat se inter carecta: rostrum exertat
aquis, ac paulisper diducit. Sic perstat immotus
donec accedant volucres, &amp; incaut√¶ rostro insideant,
arundinem aut virgultum rat√¶: continuo perfidus
insidiator, misellarum pedes contracto rostro
stringit, &amp; in gurgitem demersas vorat.

Non minor volucrum est copia, qu√†m piscium.
Certis mensibus palumbes √® silvis prorumpunt in
agros tanto numero, ut arborum ramos pr√¶gravent;
quibus postquam infederunt noctu, facile capiuntur,
&amp; barbaras mensas regali ferculo cumulant. Pr√¶terea
in vastissimo sinu, in quem evolvit se flumen sancti
Laurentii, cernitur exigua insula, seu potius biceps
scopulus: insulam volucrum dicunt. Tot enim e√≤
convolant √® finitimo pelago, ut inire numerum nequeas.
Indigen√¶ fustibus pr√¶dam non difficilem comminuunt,
aut pedibus conculcant; cymbasque lautis
dapibus, &amp; inemptis [345] plenas referunt. Ludunt
254
in aquis passim anseres, anates, arde√¶, grues, olores,
fulic√¶; &amp; aves ali√¶, victum ex undis petere solit√¶.
Peculiare quiddam habet una, gallin√¶ similis, si molem
spectes; pennis in tergo nigricantibus, sub alvo
candidis. Pedum alter unguibus aduncis armatur;
alter digitos levi &amp; continua pelle junctos habet,
qualis est anatum; hoc natat; illo pisces trahit &amp;
eviscerat.

[344 ¬ß x.] Concerning the country and manners
of the Savages of New France.

RIVERS OF NEW FRANCE; NATURE OF THE SOIL;
WILD BEASTS, FISH, BIRDS, ETC.

THERE are two great rivers in New France. One,
called by the natives Canada, a name thence extended
to the whole country, is now called the
river St. Lawrence, and flows in a very broad channel
from west to east. The other, named Mississippi,
flows from North to South, through vast regions, for
the most part still unknown. The rivers of this land
are remarkable because in certain places they are
precipitated with a great uproar from the higher to
the lower levels. The French call those places water-falls.
You might justly call them cataracts, such
as are famous in the case of the Nile. The water of
an entire river often falls in the form of an arch, in
such fashion that it is possible to walk dry-shod beneath
the stream which rushes overhead. The savages,
when they come to such a spot, shoulder their
boats, which are constructed of light bark, and carry
them, together with the baggage, to the calm portion
of the river flowing below. The chief city of
new France is called Kebec, and is situated on the
St. Lawrence river. The whole country possesses
a healthful climate, but is harassed by a cold and
long winter. This is caused partly by the frequency
of the rivers and lakes; partly by the thickness and
great extent of the forests, which diminish the force
of the sun's heat; finally, by the abundance of snow
247
with which the land, in its most Northern regions,
which lie upon the same parallel as old France, is
continually desolated for three or four months. The
soil is extremely productive of all sorts of trees and
plants, especially where the clearing of the forest has
furnished additional space for cultivation. The same
quadrupeds are found as in Europe; some, as the
moose, are peculiar to the country. The natives call
it the "great beast." This name it receives because
of the huge size of its body, for it is as large as an
ox. Its head resembles that of a mule; its horns,
hoofs, and tail, those of a stag. The savages hunt this
animal with the aid of dogs; when it is worn out they
dispatch it with spears and missiles. If hunting-dogs
are lacking, they themselves go in place of
them. Indeed, they proceed through the midst of
the snow with incredible swiftness; and, in order that
the weight of the body may not sink their feet too
deeply into the snow, they place beneath their soles,
and fasten to their feet, broad pieces of net-work, very
similar to those with which players commonly strike
the ball. These pieces of net-work, which cover a
sufficiently large portion of the surface of the snow,
readily support them while running. But the moose,
planting their slender legs deeply into the snow,
with difficulty extricate themselves. The savages
eat its flesh, are clothed with its skin, and are cured
by the hoof of its left hind leg. In this hoof there
is a certain marvelous and manifold virtue, as is
affirmed by the testimony of the most famous physicians.
It avails especially against the epilepsy,
whether it be applied to the breast, where the heart
is throbbing, or whether it be placed in the bezel of a
ring, which is worn upon the finger next to the little
finger of the left hand; or, finally, if it be also held
249
in the hollow of the left hand, clenched in the fist.
Nor does it have less power in the cure of pleurisy,
dizziness, and, if we may believe those familiar with
it, six hundred other diseases.

Another well-known and common sort of animal
there, is the beaver; its skins, which are exchanged
for European merchandise, being the basis of almost
the entire system of Canadian commerce. Its color
resembles that of the chestnut; the shape of its body
is like that of a small wether; its legs are short and
formed for swimming; its tail, which it uses as a
rudder while swimming, is smooth, thick and flat;
two teeth, larger than the others, project from its
mouth on each side; these, the beavers use like a
sword and a saw in cutting down trees when they
build their houses, for in the construction of these
they exhibit wonderful industry. They locate them
on the banks of lakes or rivers; they build walls of
logs, placing between them wet and sticky sods in
the place of mortar, so that the work can, even with
great violence, scarcely be torn apart and destroyed.
The entire house is divided into several stories; the
lowest is composed of thicker cross-beams, with
branches strewn upon them, and provided with a
hole or small door through which they can pass into
the river whenever they wish; this story extends
somewhat above the water of the river, while the
others rise higher, into which they retire if the
swelling stream submerges the lowest floor. They
sleep in one of the upper stories; a soft bed is furnished
by dry seaweed and tree moss, with which
they protect themselves from the cold; on another
floor they have their store-room, and food provided
for winter. The building is covered with a dome-shaped
roof. Thus they pass the winter, for in summer
251
they enjoy the shady coolness upon the shores,
or escape the summer heat by plunging into the water.
Often a great colony of many members is lodged
in one house. But, if they be incommoded by the
narrowness of the place, the younger ones depart of
their own accord and construct homes for themselves.
Upon the advent of cool weather in autumn,
they devote themselves to this task, and lend mutual
services in turn, both in cutting and carrying logs, so
that many assist at one and the same burden, and thus
carry down great branches and logs of forest trees.
If they find any river suitable for their purposes,
except in having sufficient depth, they build a dam
to keep back the water until it rises to the required
height. And first, by gnawing them, they fell trees
of large size; then they lay them across, from one
shore to the other. They construct a double barrier
and rampart of logs, obliquely placed, leaving between
them a space of about six feet, which they so ingeniously
fill in with stones, clay, and branches that one
would expect nothing better from the most skillful
architect. The length of the structure is greater
or less, according to the size of the stream which
they wish to restrain. Dams of this kind a fifth
of a mile long are sometimes found. But, if the
river swell more than is safe, they break open some
part of the structure, and let through as much water
as seems sufficient.

As the forests abound in wild beasts, so the rivers
teem with fish. There is one in the lake of the Iroquois,67
which is not mentioned by early authors. It
is called by the natives "Causar," and is eight feet
long, sometimes ten. It is as thick as the human
thigh; it is dun-colored, approaching white; it
bristles all over with scales, so hard and so firmly set
253
together that they turn the edge of a knife or the
point of a spear. The head is large, and protected
by an exceedingly hard skull, like a helmet. Hence,
the name of "armored fish" has been given it by
the French. It carries on perpetual war with, and
feeds upon, other fishes. For a weapon it carries an
immense beak, of the length of a man's arm and furnished
with a double row of teeth. With this hunting-spear
it not only devours other fishes, but also,
whenever it wishes to vary its diet, deceives and ensnares
birds. For this latter purpose it hides itself
among the sedge; it projects its beak from the water
and opens it slightly. It thus remains motionless
until the birds approach and thoughtlessly perch
upon the beak, deeming it a reed or a bush; then
the treacherous ensnarer seizes the feet of the unfortunate
birds by closing its beak, and, dragging them
into the water, devours them.68


The birds are fully as abundant as the fishes.
During certain months of the year the pigeons sally
forth from the woods into the open country in such
great numbers that they overload the branches of
the trees. When they have settled upon the trees at
night they are easily captured, and the savages heap
their tables with royal abundance. Besides this, in
the huge gulf into which the river saint Lawrence
flows may be seen a small island, or rather a double
rock; they call it the isle of birds.69 For so many
congregate there from the neighboring ocean that it
is impossible to count their numbers. The natives
make an easy prey of them with clubs, or by trampling
them under foot, and bring back their canoes
filled with sumptuous food acquired without price.
[345] Everywhere may be seen, sporting in the water,
geese, ducks, herons, cranes, swans, coots and other
255
birds whose habit it is to seek their living from the
waves. A certain peculiarity attaches to one, which
is about the size of a cock; its wings are black on the
outside and white beneath. One of its feet is armed
with hooked claws, the other has webbed toes, like
those of a duck; with the latter it swims, with the
former it seizes and disembowels fishes.

CANADENSIUM DOMUS &amp; RES FAMILIARIS; MORBI;
√ÜGRORUM CURA &amp; MORTUORUM.

JAM, si mores &amp; indolem gentis requiras, partim
vagi degunt, in silvis per hyemem, qu√≤ venationis
uberioris vocat spes; √¶state, ad amnium
ripas, ubi pr√¶bet facilem annonam piscatus: aliqui
pagos incolunt. Casas fabricantur infixis humi perticis:
latera corticibus intexunt; pellibus, musco,
ramis operiunt fastigia. In media casa focus: in
summo tecto foramen, emissarium fumi. Is √¶gre
eluctatus totam, ut plurimum, casam sic opplet, ut
coactis habitare in hoc fumo advenis s√¶pe oculorum
acies obtundatur, &amp; hebescat: barbari, durum genus
&amp; his assuetum incommodis, rident. Domestic√¶ rei
cura, &amp; quidquid in familia laboris est, imponitur
feminis. Ill√¶ domos figunt, ac refigunt; aquam, &amp;
ligna devehunt, cibos apparant: vicem &amp; locum mancipiorum,
opificum, &amp; jumentorum, implent. Venationis
&amp; belli cura, virorum est. Hinc gentis solitudo,
&amp; paucitas. Mulieres enim, ceteroquin haud
infecund√¶, his district√¶ laboribus, neque maturos
edere queunt fetus, neque alere jam editos: itaque
aut abortum patiuntur, aut partus recentes destituunt,
aquationi, lignationi, ceterisque operibus intent√¶;
vix ut trigesimus quisque infans adolescat. Accedit
rei medic√¶ inscitia, cujus ignoratio facit ut √® morbis
paulo gravioribus raro emergant.


258
Duos maxim√® fontes morborum statuunt: unum
ex ipsa √¶grotantis mente ortum, qu√¶ desideret quidpiam,
ac tandiu corpus √¶grum vexet, dum re desiderata
potiatur. Putant enim inesse in hominum
unoquoque innata qu√¶dam desideria, s√¶pe ipsis ignota,
quibus singulorum felicitas contineatur. Ad ejusmodi
desideria &amp; innatas appetitiones cognoscendas
adhibent hariolos, quibus hanc divinitus concessam
facultatem arbitrantur, ut animorum intimos recessus
pervideant. Illi, quodcumque primum occurrit, aut
ex quo fieri qu√¶stum aliquem posse suspicantur, ab
√¶gro desiderari pronunciant. Nec dubitant parentes,
amici, &amp; consanguinei √¶grotantis, quidquid illud
sit, quantivis pretii, comparare ac largiri √¶gro, nunquam
postea reposcendum. Ille dono fruitur, &amp;
lucri partem hariolis aspergit; ac s√¶pe postridie vita
cedit. Vulgo tamen relevantur √¶groti, quippe levibus
tentati morbis: nam in gravioribus timidiores
sunt isti pr√¶stigiatores, negantque inveniri posse quid
√¶grotus desideret: tunc eum depositum conclamant,
auctoresque sunt consanguineis ut hominem tollant √®
medio. Ita longiore morbo vexatos necant, aut senio
fessos; eamque caritatem summam interpretantur,
quia mors √¶rumnis languentium finem ponit. Eandem
benevolentiam adhibent erga pueros parentibus
orbatos, quos nullos esse malunt, quam miseros. Alterum
fontem morborum esse censent veneficorum occultas
artes, &amp; pr√¶stigias, quas ridiculis c√¶rimoniis
conantur averruncare. S√¶pe noxios humores ejiciunt
260
sudando. Certum cas√¶ locum corticibus includunt,
ac tegunt pellibus, ne qua possit aer aspirare. Intro
congerunt lapides deustos &amp; igne multo saturos. Subeunt
nudi &amp; brachia cantitantes jactant. Sed, quod
mireris, ab his thermis egressi &amp; sudore diffluentes,
hyeme perfrigida, in lacum aut amnem se conjiciunt,
de pleuritide securi.

Mortuorum cadavera nunquam efferunt per cas√¶
januam, sed per eam partem, in quam conversus eger
exspiravit. Animam putant evolare per camini spiraculum;
ac ne moras trahat, cas√¶ pristin√¶ desiderio,
neu puerulorum aliquem discedens afflet, hoc afflatu
videlicet moriturum, ut putant; crebro fuste tundunt
parietes tugurii, ut eam citius exire compellant. Immortalem
esse arbitrantur. Ne porro emoriatur fame,
magnam vim ciborum infodiunt cum corpore; vestes,
item, ollas, variamque supellectilem, magno sumptu,
&amp; multorum annorum labore conquisitam, ut iis utatur,
inquiunt, ac decentius versetur in regno mortuorum.
Sepulcra nobilium exstant paulum ab humo:
iis perticas in morem pyramidis compactas imponunt:
arcum addunt, sagittas, clypeum, &amp; alia militi√¶ decora:
feminarum vero tumulis, torques &amp; monilia.
Infantium corpora sepeliunt propter viam, ut eorum
anima, quam ab ipsorum corporibus abire longius
non putant, illabatur in pr√¶tereuntis alicujus femin√¶
sinum, &amp; adhuc informem animare fetum possit. In
luctu vultum inficiunt fuligine. Moniti de funere
affines, vicini, &amp; amici concurrunt in funestum tugurium.
262
Unus aliquis, si mortui conditio ferat, verba
facit, neque rationem ullam ex iis pr√¶termittit,
qu√¶ ad leniendam √¶gritudinem √† dicendi magistris
afferri solent. Excurrit in demortui laudes: hominem
eum natum fuisse admonet, atque adeo morti
obnoxium: qui casus emendari nequeant, fieri patientia
leviores; alia id genus in eandem sententiam edisserit.
Tertio die funus ducitur. Epulum funebre
apponitur toti pago, singulis suam symbolam, nec
malign√®, conferentibus. Hujus epuli causas afferunt
maxim√® tres: primam, ut communem m√¶rorem leniant:
alteram, ut qui amici peregr√® ad funus veniunt,
accipiantur honestius: tertiam, ut gratificentur extincti
Manibus, quem ea liberalitate delectari existimant,
&amp; appositis etiam dapibus pasci. Peracto
convivio pr√¶fectus funeris, quem in singulis familiis
clarioribus, certum atque insignem habent, adesse
tempus exequiarum proclamat. Omnes continuo
lamentari, &amp; ululare. Effertur cadaver propinquorum
humeris, intectum fibrinis pellibus, &amp; in feretro,
√® corticibus juncisve confecto compositum, collectis in
glomum artubus, ut eo modo terr√¶ mandetur, inquiunt,
quo in alvo materna olim jacuit. Deponitur
feretrum in constituto loco, munera qu√¶ quisque
offert mortuo, pr√¶figuntur perticis: &amp; appellantur
illorum auctores √† funeris pr√¶fecto: instauratur
planctus; denique juvenes ludicro certamine inter se
dimicant.

Majori sepeliuntur apparatu &amp; luctu, qui aquis
264
obruti perierunt. Nam eorum cadavera laniantur:
carnium pars cum visceribus in ignem projicitur. Id
sacrificii quoddam genus est, quo placare c&oelig;lum contendunt.
Iratum enim esse genti non dubitant, cum
in undis quispiam extinguitur: ac si quid rite atque
ordine peractum in istis funeribus non fuerit, huic
piaculo calamitates omnes, quibus postea conflictantur,
acceptas ferunt. Indulgent luctui per annum
integrum. Primis diebus decem jacent humi, diu
noctuque in ventrem proni: nefas tunc vocem ullam,
nisi qu√¶ dolorem significet, mittere; aut accedere ad
ignem, aut conviviis interesse. Anno reliquo luctus
continuatur; at levius. Omittuntur omnia urbanitatis
officia, colloquia cum vicinis, congressus amicorum;
ac si conjugem amiserint; c&oelig;libes, donec annus
fluxerit, perstant. Post octavum aut decimum quemque
annum Hurones, qu√¶ natio lat√® patet, omnia
cadavera certum in locum ex omnibus pagis deportant,
&amp; in foveam pr√¶grandem conjiciunt. Eum
diem Mortuorum vocant. Is ubi de procerum sententia
constitutus est, eruunt corpora sepulcris; alia jam
consumpta, &amp; ossibus vix h√¶rentia; alia putri carne
leviter amicta: alia scatentia f&oelig;dis vermibus, &amp; graviter
olentia. Ossa, dissoluta in saccos abdunt: cadavera
nondum dissuta componunt in sarcophagis, &amp;
supplicantium ritu deferunt in destinatum locum,
alto silentio, &amp; composito gradu procedentes, non
sine suspiriis, &amp; lamentabili eiulatu. Ne vero memoria
nobilium, &amp; arte pr√¶sertim bellica insignium,
266
qui prole carent, intercidat, eligunt aliquem √¶tate
ac robore florentem, cui demortui nomen imponunt.
Ille militum statim delectum habet, ac bellum capessit,
ut pr√¶claro quopiam edito facinore, probet
se non tantum nominis, sed etiam virtutis ejus, cui
substituitur, heredem esse. Inferioris not√¶ nomina
√¶terno silentio damnant. Itaque simul ac in pago
quispiam √® vita cessit, ejus nomen alta voce pronunciatur
per omnes casas, ne quis illud temere usurpet.
Quod si mortuum tamen appellare necesse fuerit, utuntur
verborum circuitione, &amp; pr√¶fantur quidpiam, quo
mortis ominosa [346] memoria leniatur. Idque si
omittatur, accipiunt in gravem contumeliam: neque
atrociori maledicto vulnerari filium aut parentem
posse putant, quam si huic filius, illi parens, mortuus
exprobretur.



257
HOMES AND HOUSEHOLD ECONOMY OF THE CANADIANS;
DISEASES; TREATMENT OF THE
SICK AND OF THE DEAD.

NOW, if you inquire concerning the customs and
character of this people, I will reply that a
part of them are nomads, wandering during
the winter in the woods, whither the hope of better
hunting calls them&mdash;in the summer, on the shores of
the rivers, where they easily obtain their food by fishing;
while others inhabit villages. They construct
their huts by fixing poles in the ground; they cover
the sides with bark, the roofs with hides, moss and
branches. In the middle of the hut is the hearth,
from which the smoke escapes through an opening at
the peak of the roof. As the smoke passes out with
difficulty, it usually fills the whole hut, so that
strangers compelled to live in these cabins suffer injury
and weakening of the eyes; the savages, a coarse
race, and accustomed to these discomforts, ridicule
this. The care of household affairs, and whatever
work there may be in the family, are placed upon the
women. They build and repair the wigwams, carry
water and wood, and prepare the food; their duties
and position are those of slaves, laborers and beasts
of burden. The pursuits of hunting and war belong
to the men. Thence arise the isolation and numerical
weakness of the race. For the women, although
naturally prolific, cannot, on account of their occupation
in these labors, either bring forth fully-developed
offspring, or properly nourish them after they
have been brought forth; therefore they either suffer
259
abortion, or forsake their new-born children, while
engaged in carrying water, procuring wood and other
tasks, so that scarcely one infant in thirty survives
until youth. To this there is added their ignorance
of medicine, because of which they seldom recover
from illnesses which are at all severe.

They believe that there are two main sources of
disease: one of these is in the mind of the patient
himself, which desires something, and will vex the
body of the sick man until it possesses the thing required.
For they think that there are in every man
certain inborn desires, often unknown to themselves,
upon which the happiness of individuals depends.
For the purpose of ascertaining desires and innate
appetites of this character, they summon soothsayers,
who, as they think, have a divinely-imparted
power to look into the inmost recesses of the mind.
These men declare that whatever first occurs to
them, or something from which they suspect some
gain can be derived, is desired by the sick person.
Thereupon the parents, friends, and relatives of the
patient do not hesitate to procure and lavish upon him
whatever it may be, however expensive, a return of
which is never thereafter to be sought. The patient
enjoys the gift, divides a portion of it among the
soothsayers, and often on the next day departs from
life. Commonly, however, the sick recover, plainly
because their illnesses are slight; for, in the case of
more severe complaints, these soothsayers are more
cautious, and deny the possibility of ascertaining
what the patient desires; then they bewail him whom
they have given up, and cause the relatives to put
him out of the way. Thus they kill those afflicted
with protracted illness, or exhausted by old age, and
consider this the greatest kindness, because death
261
puts an end to the sufferings of the sick. They display
the same benevolence towards children deprived
of their parents, whom they prefer to see dead rather
than to see them miserable. They believe that another
source of disease is the hidden arts and the
charms of sorcerers, which they seek to avert by
means of absurd ceremonies. Often they expel noxious
humors by sweating. They inclose a certain
portion of the hut with pieces of bark and cover it
with hides, in order that no air may enter. Within
they pile stones heated to a high temperature. They
enter naked and toss their arms while singing. But,
strange to say, they will leave this heat, dripping
with perspiration, and in the very coldest part of
winter cast themselves into a lake or river, careless
of pleurisy.

They never bear out the corpses of the dead
through the door of the lodge, but through that
part toward which the sick person turned when he
expired. They think that the soul flies out through
the smoke-hole; and, in order that it may not linger
through longing for its old home, nor while departing
breathe upon any of the children, who by such
an act would be, as they think, doomed to death,
they beat the walls of the wigwam with frequent
blows of a club, in order that they may compel the
soul to depart more quickly. They believe it to be
immortal. That it may not thereafter perish with
hunger, they bury with the body a large quantity of
provisions; also, garments, pots, and various utensils
of great expense, and acquired by many years' labor,
in order, they say, that he may use them and pass
his time more suitably in the kingdom of the dead.
The tombs of the chiefs are raised a little from the
ground; upon them they place poles joined in the
263
form of a pyramid; they add a bow, arrows, shield
and other insignia of war; but upon the tombs of the
women they place necklaces and collars. They bury
the bodies of infants beside paths, in order that
their souls, which they think do not depart very far
from the body, may slip into the bosoms of women
passing by, and animate the yet undeveloped fetus.
In mourning, they stain the face with soot. When
informed of a death, the relatives, neighbors, and
friends assemble at the lodge where the corpse lies.
If the condition of the dead permit, one of them
makes a speech, in which he employs all those arguments
that the most eloquent speakers are wont to
use for the solace of grief. He rehearses the praises
of the dead; he reminds them that the latter was born
a man, and therefore liable to death; that those misfortunes
which cannot be repaired are made lighter
by patience; he sets forth other things of that sort to
the same effect. On the third day the funeral is
held. A funeral feast is provided for the whole village,
each individual liberally furnishing his share.
For this feast they advance three main reasons: first,
that they may assuage the general grief; secondly,
that those friends who come from a distance to the
funeral may be more fittingly entertained; thirdly,
that they may please the spirit of the dead, which,
they believe, is delighted by this exhibition of liberality,
and also partakes of the repast placed for him.
When the feast is completed the master of the
funeral, who, in each distinguished family, permanently
holds this office and is greatly honored, proclaims
that the time for the burial has come. All
give utterance to continuous lamentations and wailings.
The corpse, wrapped in beaver skins, and
placed upon a bier made of bark and rushes, with his
265
limbs bent and pressed tightly against his body in
order that, as they say, he may be committed to the
earth in the same position in which he once lay in
his mother's womb, is borne out on the shoulders of
the relatives. The bier is set down at the appointed
place, the gifts which each one offers to the dead are
fastened to poles, and the donors are named by the
master of the funeral. The mourning is renewed;
finally, boys vie with each other in a mock contest.

Those who have been drowned are buried with
greater ceremony and lamentation. For their bodies
are cut open, and a portion of the flesh, together with
the viscera, thrown into the fire. This is a sort of
sacrifice, by means of which they seek to appease
heaven. For they are sure that heaven is enraged
against the race whenever any one loses his life by
drowning. If any part of these funeral rites has not
been duly and regularly performed, they believe that
all the calamities from which they afterwards may
suffer are a punishment for this neglect. They indulge
their grief throughout an entire year. For
the first ten days they lie upon the ground day and
night, flat upon their bellies; it is impious then to
utter any sound unless significant of grief, or to approach
the fire, or to take part in feasts. During
the remainder of the year the mourning continues,
but less vigorously. All the duties of politeness,
conversation with neighbors, and association with
friends, are neglected; and, if a man has lost a wife
he remains unmarried until the year has expired.
Every eight or ten years the Hurons, which nation is
widely extended, convey all their corpses from all
the villages to a designated place and cast them into
an immense pit. They call it the day of the Dead.
When this has been decreed by resolution of the
267
elders, they drag out the corpses from their graves,
some already decomposed, with flesh scarcely clinging
to the bones, others thinly covered with putrid
flesh, others teeming with vile worms and smelling
fearfully. The loose bones they place in sacks, the
bodies not yet disintegrated they place in coffins, and
bear them, in the manner of suppliants, to the appointed
place, proceeding amid deep silence and with
regular step, uttering sighs and mournful cries. But,
in order that the memory of chiefs and of those
especially famous in the art of war, who lack offspring,
may not fail, they choose some person in the
flower of his age and strength, to whom they give the
name of the dead man. The namesake immediately
makes a levy of warriors and starts for battle, in
order that by the achievement of some glorious deed
he may prove himself the heir not only of the name
but also of the valor of him whose place he has
taken. Names of lesser note are condemned to everlasting
silence. Therefore, as soon as any one in the
village has departed this life his name is proclaimed
in a loud voice throughout all the lodges, in order
that no one may rashly use it. But if, nevertheless,
it be necessary to name the dead man, they use a
circumlocution and preface something by which the
unpleasant [346] recollection of his death may be
softened. If that be omitted they consider it a
deadly insult: nor do they think that son or parent
can be wounded by more savage abuse than when
their dead relatives are defamed before them.

BELLI GERENDI RATIO; ARMA; CRUDELITAS IN
CAPTIVOS.

BELLA temere ac ferociter suscipiunt, nulla s√¶pe,
aut perlevi de causa. Duces communi suffragio
legunt, eosque vel familiarum pr√¶cipuarum
natu maximos, vel quorum virtus bellica, aut etiam
eloquentia perspecta sit. Civili bello nunquam inter
se concurrunt; arma in finitimos tantum movent;
neque imperii ac ditionis proferend√¶ causa, sed fer√® ut
illatam sibi, vel f&oelig;deratis, injuriam ulciscantur. Gladios,
&amp; gravidas nitrato pulvere fistulas, √† Batavis &amp;
Anglis accepere, quibus armis freti, certi√πs &amp; audacius
in hostium, atque ade√≤ Europ√¶orum perniciem
conspirant. Interdum bella singulari certamine finiunt.
Agmina duo, hinc Montanorum, quos vocant,
inde Iroqu√¶orum constiterant ante aliquot annos,
velut in procinctu. Duces antegressi jam designabant
locum ad aciem explicandam, cum unus alterum
sic allocutus fertur: Parcamus nostrorum sanguini,
imo nostro: manibus nudis rem agamus. Uter
alterum dejecerit, is vincat. Placuit conditio. Manus
ambo conferunt. Montanus Iroqu√¶um ita delassavit,
dolum artemque virtuti miscens, ut humi denique
prostratum ligaverit, impositumque humeris ad suum
agmen victor detulerit. Clypeos conficiunt √® ligno
dolato, plerumque cedrino; paulum ad oras incurvos:
270
leves, pr√¶longos &amp; peramplos, ita ut totum corpus
protegant. Jam, ne jaculis, aut securibus perrumpantur
omnino ac dissiliant, eos intus consuunt restibus
ex animalium corio contextis, qu√¶ totam clypei
molem continent connectuntque. Non gestant √® brachio
suspensos, sed funem ex quo pendent, rejiciunt in
humerum dextrum: adeo ut latus corporis sinistrum
clypeo protegatur; mox ubi jaculum emiserunt, aut
ferream disploserunt fistulam, paulum retrahunt dextrum
latus, ac sinistrum clypeo tectum obvertunt hosti.

In pr√¶lio id maxim√® student, vivos ut hostes capiant.
Captis &amp; in suos abductis pagos primum vestes
detrahunt; deinde ungues crudis dentibus singillatim
avellunt: tum palo alligatos verberant ad satietatem.
Mox vinculis solutos cogunt ire, ac redire, geminum
inter ordinem armatorum spinis, fustibus &amp; ferramentis.
Denique, accenso circum foco, lentis ignibus
miseros torrent. Interim torosas carnes fodicant
candentibus laminis, &amp; verubus, aut recisas ac semiustulatas,
sanie fluentes &amp; sanguine, vorant. Nunc
t√¶dis ardentibus totum corpus, ac pr√¶sertim hiatus
vulnerum, pertentant: nunc detracta capitis cute inspergunt
nud√¶ calv√¶ favillam, &amp; fervidos cineres:
nunc brachiorum nervos ac pedum vellunt, lancinant,
aut hebeti secant lente ferro, derepta parumper cute,
in pedis malleolo, &amp; manus carpo. S√¶pe cogunt captivum
infelicem ingredi per subjectos ignes: aut
frusta su√¶ carnis mandere, ac vivo sepulcro condere.
Hujusmodi carnificinam non pauci √® Patribus Societatis
272
pertulere. Hanc porro extrahunt in multos
dies; utque novis cruciatibus tristis victima suppetat,
intermittunt eosdem aliquandiu, donec ad extremum
fatiscant corpora, &amp; concidant. Tunc √® pectore cor
avellunt, torrent subjectis prunis; &amp; cruore cond√Ætum
juvenibus avid√® comedendum objiciunt, si captivus
suppliciorum acerbitatem generos√® fuerit perpessus:
ut viri fortis, inquiunt, masculum robur juventus bellatrix
combibat. Laudatur qui rogum, cultros, vulnera,
irretorto vultu aspexerit, &amp; exceperit: qui non
ingemuerit, qui risu cantuque tortoribus illuserit:
nam canere tot inter mortes, amplum ac magnificum
esse putant. Itaque cantilenas ipsi multo ante componunt,
quas capti, si sors ferat, recitent. Reliqua
multitudo cadaver absumit in ferali convivio. Dux
reservat sibi verticis pellem cum coma, monumentum
victori√¶, troph√¶um crudelitatis.



269
METHODS OF WARFARE; WEAPONS; CRUELTY TO
PRISONERS.

THEY engage in war rashly and savagely, often
with no cause, or upon a very slight pretext.
They choose as leaders, by general vote, either
the eldest members of illustrious families or those
whose warlike valor, or even eloquence, has been approved.
In civil war they never engage; they carry
arms only against their neighbors, and not for the
sake of extending their dominion and sway, but usually,
in order that they may avenge an injury inflicted
upon themselves or their allies. They have obtained
swords and guns from the Dutch and English, and,
relying upon these weapons, they plan with greater
determination and boldness the destruction of their
enemies, and even of the Europeans. Sometimes
they decide their wars by single combat. Two
bands, one of the so-called Montagnais,70 the other
of Iroquois, had met a few years ago in readiness
for battle. The leaders had advanced and were already
designating the positions for the formation of
the lines of attack, when it is said that one thus addressed
the other: "Let us spare the blood of our
followers; nay, rather let us spare our own. Let us
settle the matter with our bare hands, and he who
overcomes the other shall be the victor." The proposition
was accepted, and the two joined battle.
The Montagnais, by means of a combination of strategy
and skill with courage, so wearied the Iroquois
that he finally hurled the latter to the ground, bound
him, and triumphantly carried him off upon his
271
shoulders to his own band. They make their shields
of hewn wood, principally cedar, with slightly-curving
edges, light, very long and very large, so that
they cover the entire body. Next, in order that
they may not be penetrated and split by spears or
tomahawks, they overlace them on the inner side
with thongs made from the skins of animals, which
hold together and connect the whole mass of the
shield. They do not carry the shield suspended from
the arm, but cast by a cord over the right shoulder,
so that it protects the left side of the body; when
they have cast their spears or fired their guns they
slightly retire the right side and turn toward the enemy
the left side, which is protected by the shield.

In battle they strive especially to capture their
enemies alive. Those who have been captured and
led off to their villages are first stripped of their
clothing; then they savagely tear off their nails one
by one with their teeth; then they bind them to
stakes and beat them as long as they please. Next
they release them from their bonds, and compel them
to pass back and forth between a double row of men
armed with thorns, clubs and instruments of iron.
Finally, they kindle a fire about them, and roast the
miserable creatures with slow heat. Sometimes
they pierce the flesh of the muscles with red-hot
plates and with spits, or cut it off and devour it, half-burned
and dripping with gore and blood. Next,
they plant blazing torches all over the body, and
especially in the gaping wounds; then, after scalping
him they scatter ashes and live coals upon his
naked head; then they tear the tendons of the arms
and legs, lacerate them, or, after removing a little of
the skin, leisurely cut them with a knife at the ankle
and wrist. Often they compel the unhappy prisoner
273
to walk through fire, or to eat, and thus entomb in a
living sepulchre, pieces of his own flesh. Torture
of this sort has been borne by not a few of the
Fathers of the Society. Moreover, they prolong
this torment throughout many days, and, in order
that the poor victim may undergo fresh trials, intermit
it for some time, until his vitality is entirely exhausted
and he perishes. Then they tear the heart
from the breast, roast it upon the coals, and, if the
prisoner has bravely borne the bitterness of the
torture, give it, seasoned with blood, to the boys, to
be greedily eaten, in order, as they say, that the
warlike youth may imbibe the heroic strength of
the valiant man. The prisoner who has beheld and
endured stake, knives and wounds with an unchanging
countenance, who has not groaned, who with
laughter and song has ridiculed his tormentors, is
praised; for they think that to sing amid so many
deaths is great and noble. So they themselves compose
songs long beforehand, in order that they may
repeat them if they should by chance be captured.
The rest of the crowd consume the corpse in a brutal

SIC hostes accipiunt: at domi colunt pacem, rixasque
diligenter cavent, nisi quas ebrietatis impotentia
excitavit. Fortunati, si nunquam illis
hanc pestem Europa importasset! Irasci ne norunt
quidem, ac vehementer initio mirabantur, cum inveherentur
Patres in vitia pro concione, eosque furere
existimabant, qui pacatos inter auditores, &amp; amicos,
tanta contentione se jactarent. Liberalitatis &amp; munificenti√¶
famam aucupantur: sua largiuntur ultro;
ablata vix repetunt: nec fures aliter, quam risu &amp;
sannis ulciscuntur. Si quem, oborta simultate nefarie
aliquid moliri suspicantur, non minis deterrent hominem,
sed donis. Ex eodem concordi√¶ studio fit ut
assentiantur ultro, quidquid doceas; nihilo tamen
secius tenent mordicus insitam opinionem aut superstitionem:
eoque difficilius erudiuntur. Quid enim
agas cum annuentibus verbo &amp; concedentibus omnia;
re nihil pr√¶stantibus? Miserorum egestatem benign√®
sublevant; viduarum ac senum sustentant orbitatem,
nisi cum senio √¶tas vieta marcet, vel morbus gravior
incidit: tunc enim abrumpere infelicem vitam satius
arbitrantur, qu√†m alere ac producere. Qu√¶cumque
calamitas ingruat, nunquam se dimoveri de animi
tranquillitate patiuntur, qua felicitatem potissimum
276
definiunt. Inediam multorum dierum, morbos, &amp;
√¶rumnas lenissime &amp; constantissim√® perferunt. Ipsos
partus dolores, licet acerbissimos, ita dissimulant femin√¶
vel superant, ut ne ingemiscant quidem: ac si cui
lacryma vel gemitus excideret, √¶terna flagraret ignominia,
neque virum, √† quo duceretur, pr√¶terea inveniret,
Nihil unquam amicus cum amico, uxor cum
viro, cum uxore vir, queritur &amp; expostulat. Liberos
mira caritate complectuntur: sed modum non tenent;
in eos enim neque animadvertunt ipsi, neque ab aliis
animadverti sinunt. Hinc petulantia puerorum &amp;
ferocitas, qu√¶, postqu√†m se corroboravit √¶tate, in
omne scelus erumpit. Quam autem erga liberos &amp;
familiares comitatem pr√¶ se ferunt, eandem cum
ceteris civibus suis, ac popularibus, usurpant. Si
quis amariore joco quempiam momordit, (nam dicaces
vulgo sunt, &amp; in jocos effusi) belle dissimulant,
aut vicem reponunt, &amp; absentes remordent; nam pr√¶sentes
cavillari, aut coram dictis incessere, religio est.
Non aliud libenti√πs convicium regerunt lacessiti, qu√†m
si hominem ingenio carere dicant. Scilicet ingenii
laudem vindicant sibi; nec temere. Nemo inter illos
hebes, ac tardus; quod nativa illorum in deliberando
prudentia, &amp; in dicendo facundia, declarat. Auditi
quidem s√¶pe sunt tam apposit√® ad persuadendum perorare,
idque ex tempore, ut admirationem exercitatissimis
in dicendi pal√¶stra moverent.

Respondet ingenio corpus, aptum membris, proceritate
278
formosum, robore validum. Idem, qui Gallis,
color; tametsi corrumpunt illum unguine, &amp; oleo
putri, quo se perungunt; necnon pigmentis variis,
quibus sibi pulcri, nobis ridiculi, videntur. Alios
cernas naso c√¶ruleo, genis vero &amp; superciliis atratis:
alii frontem, nasum, &amp; genas, lineis versicoloribus
discriminant: totidem larvas intueri te putes. Ejusmodi
coloribus credunt se hostibus esse terribiles;
suum pariter in acie metum, quasi velo, tegi: demum
pellem ipsam corporis indurari, ad vim hiberni frigoris
facilius tolerandam. Pr√¶ter istos colores induci
pro cujusque libidine ac deleri solitos, non pauci stabiles
ac perpetuas avium aut animalium, put√† serpentis,
aquil√¶, bufonis, imagines imprimunt cuti, hunc
in modum. Subulis, cuspidibus, aut spinis collum,
pectus, genasve ita pungunt, ut rudia rerum istarum
lineamenta effingant: mox in punctam &amp; cruentam
cutem immittunt atrum √® carbone comminuto pulverem,
qui cum sanguine concretus impressas effigies ita
inurit viv√¶ carni, ut eas nulla temporis diuturnitas
expungat. Tot√¶ qu√¶dam nationes, ea pr√¶sertim
qu√¶ a Tabaco nomen habet, itemque alia qu√¶ Neutra
dicitur, id constanti more ac lege usurpat, nec sine
periculo interdum; maxime si est tempestas frigidior,
aut debilior [347] corporis constitutio. Tunc enim
dolore victi, licet eum ne gemitu quidem significent,
linquuntur animo, &amp; exanimes aliquando concidunt.
Laudant oculos exiles, labra repanda &amp; prominentia:
280
pars radunt comam, pars alunt: his nudum sinciput,
illis occiput: aliis coma tota surrigitur in vertice,
aliis parc√® ad tempora utrimque propendet. Barbam,
instar monstri, execrantur; ac si quis in mento
succrescat pilus, statim vellunt. Viri √¶que ac
femin√¶ imas auriculas pertundunt: &amp; iis inaures √®
vitro, testisve piscium, inferunt. Quo foramen amplius
est, eo censent formosius. Nunquam ungues
resecant. Europ√¶os rident, qui defluentem √® naribus
humorem candidis sudariis excipiant, &amp;, Quo, inquiunt,
rem adeo sordidam reservant isti? Saltantes
curvant arcuatim corpus prono capite, &amp; brachia sic
agitant, ut qui farinam manibus subigunt, rauc√πm
identidem grunnientes. Alvum infimam succingunt
lato cortice, vel animantis pelle, aut versicolore panno,
cetera nudi. Femin√¶ pelles ex humeris &amp; collo promittunt
ad genua. Zonas atque armillas, √® concha veneria,
quam vulgo porcellanam appellamus, aut seta
hystricis non inscite contextas, gestant: torques hunc
in modum confectos magno habent in pretio. Storeas
√® marisco (junci marini genus est) satis eleganter
elaborant: iis pavimentum sternunt, in iisdem
carpunt somnos, aut in vitulorom marinorum, fibrorumve
mollibus exuviis. Dormiunt circa focum in
mapali medio semper ardentem, si frigus est: sub dio,
si √¶stas.

Mensam, aut cathedram, in casa tota videas nullam;
in clunes subsidunt, simiarum instar: is vescentium,
282
is deliberantium, &amp; confabulantium habitus est.
Adeuntes amicos salutant inepto risu; s√¶pius ho,
hho, hhho, conclamantes. Cum vescuntur, potum
dapibus non intermiscent, neque identidem bibunt;
sed semel tant√πm, sumpto cibo. Qui amicos convivio
accipit, cum iis neque accumbit, nec ciborum partem
ullam attingit, sed epulantibus dividit: aut, si quem
adhibet structorem, sedet seorsum jejunus, &amp; spectat.
Inter edendum silent: salem aversantur, &amp; condimenta:
ossa canibus projicere piaculum arbitrantur:
igni cremant, vel terr√¶ infodiunt. Si enim, inquiunt,
ursi, fibri, &amp; ali√¶, quas venando captamus, fer√¶, ossa
sua permitti canibus, &amp; comminui, rescirent; non tam
facile capi se paterentur. Adipem √® pinguibus collectum
cibis, abstergunt coma; genis interdum brachiisve
allinunt, eleganti√¶, ut aiunt, causa, &amp; valetudinis:
nam adipe non solum nitere cutem, sed corroborari
membra existimant. Non alio cibo vescuntur
libentius qu√†m Sagamita. Pulmentum est √® farina,
pr√¶sertim Indici tritici, confectum: admisto, quod
illis condimentum pr√¶cipu√® sapit, oleo. Itaque in
conviviis pars dapum prima oleum, aut adeps, in
quem concretum &amp; spissum ita dentes infigunt, ut nos
in panem aut pomum. Antequam illis lebetes, cortin√¶,
aliaque id genus vasa √¶rea deferrentur √® Gallia,
utebantur cacabis √® cortice compactis; ver√πm quia
imponi flammis non poterant impun√®, hanc ad coquendas
carnes artem excogitaverant. Silices plurimos
284
conjiciebant in focum, donec penitus ignem combibissent.
Candentes in ollam frigida plenam &amp; carnibus
alios atque alios subinde immittebant. Ad
hunc modum aqua calefacta carnes citius opinione
faciliusque percoquit. Ad tergendas manus utuntur
piloso canum tergo, cui illas affricant; item scobe
ligni putris. H√¶c matribus vice panniculorum est,
ad purgandas infantium sordes; h√¶c instar culcit√¶
languidis corporibus substernitur. Vasa coquinaria,
non extergunt. Quo sunt crasso pingui magis oblita,
eo melius, illorum judicio, nitent. Turpe ducunt &amp;
superbum inambulare inter colloquendum. Odorem
mosci graviter ferunt, &amp; meram esse mephitim putant,
pr√¶ carnis rancid√¶, aut adipis mucidi frusto.

Sexcenta sunt ejus generis, in quibus longissim√® recedunt
ab Europ√¶orum institutis: sed ab illorum
vitiis propius absunt, eaque vel √¶quant, vel superant.
Gul√¶ irritamenta, &amp; inimicas bon√¶ ac san√¶
menti potiones, ab Europ√¶is mercatoribus acceperunt,
quibus lucri bonus est odor, etiam ex flagitio,
&amp; scelerata nundinatione. Tandiu esse pergunt, dum
adest quod edant: nihil in crastinum, aut hyemem,
reponunt: nec famem valde reformidant, quia se ferre
diuturnam posse confidunt. Conviviis ea lex posita
consensu moribusque gentis est, ut omnia fercula
consumantur. Si quis edit parci√πs, &amp; excusat valetudinem,
plectitur, aut ejicitur, ut insulsus, quasi qui vivendi
artem nesciat. Primaria supellectilis domestic√¶
286
pars, olla est, sive ahenum, in quo carnes coquuntur.
Opes lebetum numero metiuntur: nec regem Galli√¶
aliam ob causam initio magni √¶stimabant; qu√†m
qu√≤d plures habere ollas dicebatur. Quanta sit apud
exleges, &amp; omni freno solutos, intemperanti√¶ impunitas
&amp; licentia, pr√¶sertim in adolescentibus, promptum
est intelligere: nam grandiores natu libidinem
certis finibus circumscribunt, c√πm √¶stus cupiditatum
deferbuit: nec impune est peccanti femin√¶.

Religionis apud illos neque lex ulla, neque cura.
Nullo stato &amp; certo cultu Numen prosequuntur.
Esse tamen aliquod, velut in sublustri nocte, vident.
Quod quisque puer aspicit in somnis, cum lucescere
ratio incipit, hoc illi deinceps numen est, canis, ursus,
avis. Vivendi normam &amp; agendi plerumque ducunt
√® somniis; ut si quem interficiendum, exempli causa,
somniaverint, non conquiescant donec hominem insidiis
exceptum necaverint. Piget fabulas referre,
quas de mundi opificio comminiscuntur. His implent
otiosas &amp; avidas plebis aures harioli, &amp; circulatores
nequissimi, impietate qu√¶stuosa. Malorum auctorem
genium nescio quem vocant Manito√π, ac vehementissime
perhorrescunt. Hostem procul dubio generis
humani, qui √† nonnullis divinos honores &amp; sacrificia
qu√¶dam extorquet. Circa naturam animarum non
levius delirant. Simulacra fingunt corporea, cibi &amp;
potionis egentia. Destinatum animabus versus occidentem
solem, pagum credunt, in quem obita morte
288
se recipiant: &amp; ubi epulis, venationi, &amp; choreis indulgeant.
H√¶c enim apud illos summa.

Cum primum de sempiternis ignibus, &amp; incendiis
sceleri destinatis audierunt, immane quantum obstupuere:
fidem tamen pertinaciter abrogabant, qu√≤d
dicerent ibi esse ignem non posse, ubi nihil ligni sit:
tum, qu√¶nam silv√¶ alere tot ignes, tam diuturnos, possent?
H√¶c ratio ineptissima tantam vim apud barbaras
mentes habebat, ut iis persuaderi veritas evangelica
non posset. Quippe in homine carnali, ut ait √® SS.
PP. nonnemo, tota ratio intelligendi est consuetudo
cernendi. Expugnavit nihilominus pertinaciam sacerdos
acer &amp; ingeniosus. Fidenter affirmavit inferorum
terram vices obire ligni, &amp; ipsam ardere per
sese. Risu barbar√¶ multitudinis exceptus est. Imo,
inquit, hujus Avernalis terr√¶ frustum proferam vobis,
ut, quoniam verbis divinis non creditis, vestris ipsi
oculis credatis. Accendit curiositatem promissi novitas
&amp; fiducia. Convenerunt √® tota regione ad diem
constitutum, &amp; in ingenti planitie, collibus instar amphitheatri
cincta, consederunt. Primores gentis duodecim
lecti fuere, viri graves &amp; cordati, qui sacerdotem
observarent, numquid fraudis ac pr√¶stigiarum
lateret. Ille sulphuris glebam depromit, dat istis
arbitris &amp; cognitoribus tractandam: hanc oculis, naso,
manu scrutati, haud dubie terram esse confessi sunt.
Aderat olla cum prunis candentibus. Tunc sacerdos
populo procul spectante; inhiantibus, demisso in prunas
290
naso, judicibus, excussit in carbones √® sulphurea
gleba particulas aliquot, qu√¶ subito conceperunt ignem
&amp; odore fetido nares curiosas impleverunt. Hoc
iterum, ac terti√≤ cum esset factum, assurrexit multitudo
attonita, manum planam imponens ori, quo gestu
summam admirationem testantur; &amp; inferos esse dicenti
Deo credidit.

FOOD; FEASTS; HOUSEHOLD UTENSILS;
RELIGION AND SUPERSTITIONS.

THUS they treat their enemies; but at home they
cultivate peace and carefully avoid quarrels,
except those which the fury of drunkenness
has aroused. Fortunate would they be if Europe had
never introduced this scourge among them! They
know nothing of anger, and at first were greatly surprised
when the Fathers censured their faults before
the assembly; they thought that the Fathers were
madmen, because among peaceful hearers and friends
they displayed such vehemence. These people seek
a reputation for liberality and generosity; they give
away their property freely and very seldom ask any
return; nor do they punish thieves otherwise than
with ridicule and derision. If they suspect that any
one seeks to accomplish an evil deed by means of
false pretences, they do not restrain him with threats,
but with gifts. From the same desire for harmony
comes their ready assent to whatever one teaches
them; nevertheless they hold tenaciously to their
native belief or superstition, and on that account are
the more difficult to instruct. For what can one do
with those who in word give agreement and assent
to everything, but in reality give none? They
kindly relieve the poverty of the unfortunate; they
provide sustenance for widows and old men in their
bereavement, except when, with old age, vitality is
withering away, or some grievous disease arises; for
then they think it better to cut short an unhappy existence
than to support and prolong it. Whatever
277
misfortune may befall them, they never allow themselves
to lose their calm composure of mind, in which
they think that happiness especially consists. They
endure many days' fasting, also diseases and trials,
with the greatest cheerfulness and patience. Even
the pangs of childbirth, although most bitter, are so
concealed or conquered by the women that they do
not even groan; and if a tear or a groan should escape
any one of them, she would be stigmatized by
everlasting disgrace, nor could she find a man thereafter
who would marry her. Friends never indulge
in complaint or expostulation to friends, wives to
their husbands, or husbands to their wives. They
treat their children with wonderful affection, but
they preserve no discipline, for they neither themselves
correct them nor allow others to do so. Hence
the impudence and savageness of the boys, which,
after they have reached a vigorous age, breaks forth
in all sorts of wickedness. Moreover, they exercise
the same mildness which they exhibit toward their
children and relatives, toward the remainder of their
tribe and their countrymen. If any person has injured
another by means of a rude jest (for they are
commonly very talkative, and are ready jesters), the
latter carefully conceals it, or lays it up, and in retaliation
injures his detractor behind his back; for to
jest in the victim's presence, or to make a verbal
attack, face to face, is characteristic of religion.
There is nothing which they are more prone to use
as a counter-allegation, when provoked, than to
charge a man with a lack of intelligence. For they
claim praise because of their intelligence, and not
without good reason. No one among them is stupid
or sluggish, a fact which is evident in their inborn
foresight in deliberation and their fluency in speaking.
279
Indeed, they have often been heard to make a
peroration so well calculated for persuasion, and that
off-hand, that they would excite the admiration of
the most experienced in the arena of eloquence.

Their bodies, well proportioned, handsome because
of their height, vigorous in strength, correspond to
their minds. They have the same complexion as the
French, although they disfigure it with fat and rancid
oil, with which they grease themselves; nor do they
neglect paints of various colors, by means of which
they appear beautiful to themselves, but to us ridiculous.
Some may be seen with blue noses, but with
cheeks and eyebrows black; others mark forehead,
nose and cheeks with lines of various colors; one
would think he beheld so many hobgoblins. They
believe that in colors of this description they are
dreadful to their enemies, and that likewise their
own fear in line of battle will be concealed as by a
veil; finally, that it hardens the skin of the body, so
that the cold of winter is more easily borne. Besides
these colors, which are usually applied or removed
according to the pleasure of each person, many impress
upon the skin fixed and permanent representations
of birds or animals, such as a snake, an eagle, or
a toad, in the following manner: With awls, spear-points,
or thorns they so puncture the neck, breast or
cheeks as to trace rude outlines of those objects;
next, they insert into the pierced and bleeding skin
a black powder made from pulverized charcoal,
which unites with the blood and so fixes upon the
living flesh the pictures which have been drawn that
no length of time can efface them. Some entire
tribes&mdash;that especially which is called the Tobacco
nation, and also another, which is called the Neutral
nation&mdash;practice it as a continuous custom and
281
usage; sometimes it is not without danger, especially
if the season be somewhat cold or the physical constitution
rather weak. [347] For then, overcome by
suffering, although they do not betray it by even a
groan, they swoon away and sometimes drop dead.
They praise small eyes and turned-up and projecting
lips. Some shave their hair, others cultivate it;
some have half the head bare, others the back of the
head; the hair of some is raised upon their heads,
that of others hangs down scantily upon each temple.
They detest a beard as a monstrosity, and straightway
pull out whatever hair grows upon their chins.
The men as well as the women pierce the lobes of
their ears, and place in them earrings made of glass
or shells. The larger the hole, the more beautiful
they consider it. They never cut their nails. They
ridicule the Europeans, because the latter wipe off
the mucus flowing from the nose with white handkerchiefs,
and say: "For what purpose do they preserve
such a vile thing?" In dancing, they bend
the body, with the head lowered, in the form of a
bow, and move their arms like those who knead
dough, at the same time emitting hoarse grunts.
They gird the lower portion of the belly with a broad
piece of bark or hide or a parti-colored cloth, and
leave the rest of the body naked. The women wear
skins hanging from the shoulders and neck to the
knees. They wear belts and bracelets ingeniously
manufactured from Venus shells,71 which we commonly
call porcelain, or from porcupine quills; and
necklaces made in this fashion they value highly.
They make very neat mats from marisco (a variety of
marine rush); with these they cover their floors, and
also take their rest upon them, or upon the soft furs
of the seal or the beaver. In winter they sleep
283
about a fire constantly burning in the middle of the
lodge, in summer under the open sky.

Neither table nor chair can be seen in the hut.
They squat upon their haunches like monkeys; this
is their custom while eating, deliberating or conversing.
They greet approaching friends with silly
laughter, more often exclaiming, ho, hho, hhho.
When they eat they do not take beverages with their
food, nor do they drink often, but only once after eating.
Whoever entertains his friends at a feast
neither sits with them nor touches any part of the
food, but divides it among the feasters; or, if he has
some one act as carver, sits apart fasting and looks
on. While eating they keep silence; they reject salt
and condiments; they consider it a sin to throw the
bones to the dogs; they either burn them in the fire
or bury them in the ground. For, they say, if the
bears, beaver, and other wild animals which we capture
in hunting should know that their bones were
given to dogs and broken to pieces, they would not
suffer themselves to be taken so easily. They wipe
off upon their hair the grease which is collected from
fatty foods; sometimes they smear their cheeks or
arms for the sake, as they say, of elegance and
health; for they think that not only is the skin made
resplendent with grease, but that the limbs are thus
strengthened. For no other food do they have such
fondness as for Sagamita. It is a relish made from
flour, especially that of Indian corn, mixed with oil,
which as a flavor is held in especial esteem among
them. Therefore, in feasts the first course consists
of oil or fat, in hard and compact lumps, into which
they bite as we do into a piece of bread or an apple.
Before pots, kettles and other vessels of the sort were
brought to them from France, they used receptacles
285
of closely joined bark; but, because they could not
place them with safety over the flames, they devised
the following way of cooking meat: They cast a
large number of flint stones into the fire until they
had become red-hot. Then they would drop these
hot stones one after another into a vessel full of cold
water and meat. In this manner the water was
heated and the meat cooked more quickly and more
easily than one would suppose. For wiping their
hands they use the shaggy back of a dog, also powder
of rotten wood. The last-named is used by
mothers, in the place of wash-cloths, to clean the
dirt from their infants; it is also used as a mattress
to support the weary body. They do not cleanse
their cooking utensils. The more they are covered
with thick grease, so much the better are they, in
their judgment. They consider it disgraceful and
arrogant to walk while conversing. They dislike
the odor of musk, and consider it a downright pest
in comparison with a piece of rancid meat or moldy
fat.

There, are six hundred matters of this sort in which
their customs differ very widely from those of Europeans;
but they are less removed from the faults of
the latter, and either equal or excel them. They
have received stimulants of the appetite, and drinks
hostile to a good and sound mind, from European
traders, who think much of profit, even when tainted
with the disgrace of a wicked traffic. They continue
to exist so long as they have anything to eat; they
store up nothing for to-morrow, or for the winter;
nor do they greatly dread famine, because they are
confident of their ability to bear it for a long time.
In feasts it is the rule, by general consent and custom
of the race, that all the food shall be consumed.
287
If any one eats sparingly and urges his poor health
as an excuse, he is beaten or ejected as ill-bred, just
as if he were ignorant of the art of living. The principal
article of their household utensils is the pot or
kettle in which the meat is cooked. They measure
property by the number of kettles, and in the beginning
conceived a high opinion of the king of
France, for no other reason than because he was said
to possess a good many kettles. How great is the
impunity and wantonness of licentiousness among
men uncivilized and free from all restraint, especially
among the youth, maybe readily observed; for
the elder men confine their lust within fixed limits,
after the violence of their passions has subsided, and
an erring woman does not go unpunished.

There is among them no system of religion, or care
for it. They honor a Deity who has no definite character
or regular code of worship. They perceive,
however, through the twilight, as it were, that some
deity does exist. What each boy sees in his dreams,
when his reason begins to develop, is to him thereafter
a deity, whether it be a dog, a bear, or a bird.
They often derive their principles of life and action
from dreams; as, for example, if they dream that
any person ought to be killed, they do not rest until
they have caught the man by stealth and slain him.
It is wearisome to recount the tales which they invent
concerning the creation of the world. Soothsayers
and worthless quacks fill with these the idle
and greedy ears of the people in order that they may
acquire an impious gain. They call some divinity,
who is the author of evil, "Manitou," and fear him
exceedingly. Beyond doubt it is the enemy of the
human race, who extorts from some people divine
honors and sacrifices. Concerning the nature of
289
spirits, they go none the less astray. They make
them corporeal images which require food and drink.
They believe that the appointed place, for souls, to
which after death they are to retire, is in the direction
of the setting sun, and there they are to enjoy
feasting, hunting, and dancing; for these pleasures
are held in the highest repute among them.

When they first heard of the eternal fire and the
burning decreed as a punishment for sin, they were
marvelously impressed; still, they obstinately withheld
their belief because, as they said, there could
be no fire where there was no wood; then, what forests
could sustain so many fires through such a long
space of time? This absurd reasoning had so much
influence over the minds of the savages, that they
could not be persuaded of the truth of the gospel.
For, plainly, in the physical man, as some one from
Sts. Peter and Paul says, the entire system of knowledge
is based on vision. Nevertheless, a clever and
ingenious priest overcame their obstinacy. He confidently
declared that the lower world possessed no
wood, and that it burned by itself. He was greeted
by the laughter of the crowd of savages. "But,"
said he, "I will exhibit to you a piece of this land
of Avernus, in order that, since you do not believe
the words of God, you may trust the evidence of your
own eyes." The novelty and boldness of the
promise aroused their curiosity. Upon the appointed
day they assembled from the whole neighborhood,
and sat down together in an immense plain, surrounded
by hills like an amphitheater. Twelve leading
men of the tribe, persons of dignity and sagacity,
were chosen to watch the priest, in order that
neither fraud nor sorcery might be concealed. He
produced a lump of sulphur and gave it to the judges
291
and inspectors to be handled; after examining it with
eyes, nose, and hand, they admitted that it was certainly
earth. There stood near by a kettle containing
live coals. Then the priest, under the eyes of
the people at a distance, while the judges were gaping
with their noses thrust down toward the coals,
shook some grains from the lump of sulphur upon
the coals, which suddenly took fire and filled the
curious noses with a stifling odor. When this had
been done a second and a third time, the crowd arose
in astonishment, placing their hands flat over their
mouths, by which gesture they signify great surprise;
and believed in the word of God that there is
a lower world.

BIBLIOGRAPHICAL DATA: VOL. I

I

Our text of Lescarbot's La Conversion follows, to
the close of p. 44 (original pagination), the copy at
Lenox Library: pp. 45, 46, the "Regitre de Bapteme,"
follow the copy at John Carter Brown Library,
Providence, R. I., as the Lenox copy does not have
these two pages.

It is a rare book; the two copies above cited are
the only ones known to us, in America. Leclerc, in
Bibliotheca Americana (Paris, 1867), p. 206, says:
"Cette pi√®ce est plus rare que l'Histoire de la
Nouvelle France," referring to Lescarbot's better-known
work. Sabin speaks of it (vol. x., no. 40167),
as "probably the rarest of Lescarbot's works."

See further references in the John Carter Brown
Catalogue (Bartlett's Bibliotheca Americana, Providence,
1882), vol. ii., no. 99: Graesse's Tr√©sor de Livres
Rares et Pr√©cieux (Dresden, 1863), vol. iv., p. 175;
Harrisse's Notes sur la Nouvelle France (Paris, 1872),
no. 21; Ternaux's Biblioth√®que Am√©ricaine (Paris, 1837),
no. 330; Winsor's Narrative and Critical History of
America, vol. iv., p. 299; and Lenox Catalogue of
Jesuit Relations (N. Y., 1879), p. 3.[XVII.]

Title-page. This is given in photographic facsimile,
in this reissue. The Lenox and Brown copies are
alike, in this. It will be noticed that there is no date
of publication, this being established from the Privilege.

Collation. Title, 1 p.; blank at back of title, 1 p.;
dedication "A la Royne," 3 pp., signed "Marc Lescarbot;"
privilege, 1 p., dated "Paris, 9 Sep.,
1610," and signed "Brigard;" text, pp. 7-44. Page
7 is misnumbered 1. (The Brown Catalogue says:
Page 1 is misnumbered 7." This is a misprint in
the Catalogue.) "Fin," at end of p. 24; then pp. 23
and 24 are reprinted, all except the last sentence on
p. 24: "Dieu vueille par sa | grace conduire le tout
en sorte que la chose | re√ºssisse √† sa gloire &amp; √† l'√©dification
de ce peu-| ple, pour lequel tous Chr√©tiens
doivent faire | continuelles prieres √† sa divine bont√©,
√† ce qu'il | lui plaise confirmer &amp; avancer l'&oelig;uvre
qu'il | lui a pleu susciter en ce temps pour l'exaltation |
de son nom, &amp; le salut de ses creatures.
| Fin."

It is evident that the intention was to have the first
leaf (pp. 23, 24) cut out. This duplication of pp. 23,
24 is in both the Brown and Lenox copies.

The "Extrait du Regitre de Bapteme" in the
Brown copy (it is not in the Lenox Copy) forms 2
pages at the end of text. The first page of this
"Regitre" is not numbered; the second is numbered
"" (intended for 46), and this ends the
301book. The same "Regitre" appears in somewhat
different order in Lescarbot's Nouvelle France, (1612
ed.), pp. 638-640, chap. 5, book v.; also, according
to Harrisse's Notes, in chap. 3, book v., of the 1611 ed.

II

In Bertrand's Lettre Missive, we follow the original
Paris edition, in Lenox. It is a rare publication, the
Lenox copy being apparently the only one in the
United States; Brown has a manuscript copy, made
from that at Lenox. Sabin (vol. x., no. 40682), says:
"It is a piece of unusual rarity." Sabin has a previous
reference in vol. ii., no. 5025, under caption
"Bertrand," wherein a misprint makes him cite the
date of the letter as "28 June, 1618" (eight years
later than the actual date); a further misprint causes
Sabin to record the pamphlet as having "48 pages or
less," the actual number being 8. In his Notes,
Harrisse omits a line-ending after the second "nouuelle"
in his description of the title-page. See, for
further references: Ternaux, no. 329; Winsor, p. 299;
Lenox Catalogue, p. 3; Brown Catalogue, vol. ii.,
no. 103.

Title-page. Given in photographic facsimile, in
present volume.

Collation. Title, 1 p.; blank at back of title, 1 p.;
text, pp. 3-6; dated on p. 6, "Port Royal xxviij. Iuin,
1610," and signed "Bertrand." Blank leaf at end,
completing 4 leaves = 8 pp.

III-VI

In these four letters, by Biard and Mass√©, we follow
Carayon's Premi√®re Mission des J√©suites au Canada
(Paris, 1864). It is a scarce book, and brought $8 at
302the Barlow Sale, in New York, 1890. See references
in Harrisse, p. 285; Sabin, no. 10792; Winsor, pp.
151, 292, 300; and Lenox Catalogue, p. 15. The origin
of the letters in the volume is found at the top
of the first page of each letter; and these data, with
accompanying notes by Carayon, are reproduced in
the present series, which will, in strict chronological
order, contain all of the papers given by that editor;
although in many cases we shall follow the original
issues of the letters, whenever found. Documents
III., V., and VI. were written in Latin; and Document
IV. in French.

Collation. Blank, 2 pp.; bastard title, 1 p.; blank,
1 p.; title proper, 1 p.; blank, 1 p. Preface begins
on p. vii. (not numbered), and ends on p. xvi. Preface
acknowledges indebtedness to F. Felix Martin,
S. J., for copying and translating into French (from
the Latin) most of the letters in the volume. Text,
pp. 1-302; Table at end, 2 pp.; the last of these is
numbered 304.

VII

We follow the style and make-up of Dr. E. B.
O'Callaghan's Reprint (Albany, N. Y., 1871) of the
Canadic√¶ Missionis, in Jouvency's Hist. Soc. Jesu, part
v., commencing p. 321. In the Lenox Catalogue,
it is designated "O'Callaghan's Reprint, No. 4."
This numbering of O'Callaghan's reprints, is merely
a device peculiar to the Lenox Catalogue, for sake of
easy reference, and has been followed by Winsor;
the reprints themselves bear no numbers.

The text of this document, however, we have
compared with the original folio edition of Jouvency's
work, in the library of St. Francis Xavier College,
New York, and the pagination thereof is indicated
303instead of that of the O'Callaghan Reprint. The
list, "Missiones Societatis Jesu in America Septentrionali
Anno M. DCC. X.," which O'Callaghan
reprints as if a part of the original Canadic√¶ Missionis,
is on pp. 961, 962 of the same volume of Jouvency in
which the latter appears (part v.).

Title-page. The O'Callaghan Reprint is closely
imitated.

Collation of O'Callaghan Reprint. Title, 1 p.; reverse
of title, with inscription: "Editio viginti

p.; "Missiones Societatis Iesu | in America Septentrionali
|Anno M.DCC.X.," 2 pp., the last of which is
numbered 38.

VIII

We follow the style and make-up of O'Callaghan's
Reprint (Albany, 1871), which is numbered 5 in the
Lenox Catalogue. The text and pagination follow
the original, in Jouvency's Hist. Soc. Jesu, part v.,
commencing p. 344.

FOOTNOTES:



[XVII.] In order to save needless repetition of long titles, bibliographical
works, when once cited in full, will thereafter be referred to by the
usual cut-shorts: e.g., the John Carter Brown Catalogue will be
hereafter known in our Bibliographical Data as "Brown Catalogue;"
the list of Jesuitica in Winsor's Narrative and Critical
History vol. iv., as "Winsor;" the Lenox Catalogue of Jesuit
Relations, as "Lenox Catalogue;" Harrisse's Notes sur la
Nouvelle France, as "Harrisse's Notes," or simply as "Harrisse;"
etc., etc. The student who is familiar, in a general way, with these
bibliographical sources,&mdash;and it is presumed that those are, for
whom this series of reprints is designed,&mdash;will not be confused by
the customary method of brief citation.



NOTES TO VOL. I

(Figures in parentheses, following number of note, refer to pages
of English text.)


1.
 (p. 55)&mdash;Marie de M√©dicis, queen regent, widow of Henry of
Navarre; appointed regent by the king, the day before his assassination,
May 14, 1610. She was accused of having been privy to
his murder.


2.
 (p. 55)&mdash;The reports of Champlain, and the maps and charts
with which, upon returning from his voyage of 1603, he entertained
Henry IV., so interested the latter that he vowed to encourage
the colonization of New France. To carry on this work he
commissioned, as his lieutenant-general in Acadia, Pierre du Gua,
Sieur de Monts, governor of Pons, a Huguenot resident at court,
and, according to Champlain, "a gentleman of great respectability,
zeal, and honesty." De Monts' commission is given at length in
Baird's Huguenot Emigration to America, vol. i., p. 341; his charter
of "La Cadie" embraced the country between the 40th and 46th
degrees of latitude, and he held therein a monopoly of the fur trade.
J. G. Bourinot, in Canadian Monthly, vol. vii., pp. 291, 292, says the
name Acadia (also written Acadie, and La Cadie) "comes from
√†k&#259;de, which is an affix used by the Souriquois or Mic Macs ...
to signify a place where there is an abundance of some particular
thing."&mdash;See, also, Laverdi√®re's &OElig;uvres de Champlain (Quebec,
1870), p. 115. In 1604, De Monts sailed from France with a colony
composed of Catholics and Huguenots, served by "a priest and a
minister." Champlain and Poutrincourt were with the expedition,
and Pontgrav√© commanded one of the two ships. The cancelling
of his monopoly (1607), deprived De Monts of the means to carry
on his colonization schemes. The title to Port Royal he had already
ceded to Poutrincourt. The king renewed De Monts' monopoly for
one year, upon his undertaking to found a colony in the interior.
Thereupon De Monts sent Champlain to the St. Lawrence (1608),
as his lieutenant. Upon the death of Henry IV. (1610), De Monts,
now financially ruined, surrendered his commission, selling his proprietary
rights to the Jesuits.

"Jean de Biencourt, Baron de Poutrincourt, a gentleman of Picardy,
a brave chevalier, had carried arms against Henry IV. in the
306ranks of the Catholics, during the wars of the League. Lescarbot
tells how 'The king, holding him besieged in his castle of Beaumont,
wished to give him the dukedom of this place in order to attach him
to his service.' Poutrincourt refused. But, when the king had abjured
his faith, he served this prince loyally and followed him to
battle, where he accumulated more honor than fortune. In 1603, he
lived in retirement with his wife, Jeanne de Salazar, and his children,
in his barony of Saint-Just, in Champagne, struggling painfully
against the difficulties of an embarrassed situation, and striving to
improve the tillage and crops of his little domain. It was here that
De Monts, his former companion in arms, found him. He knew his
courage, his intelligence, and his activity, and did not doubt that a
voyage to Canada and an agricultural colony in these distant lands,
so fertile and primeval, would appeal to his ardent soul. Poutrincourt,
in fact, received with enthusiasm the plan of his old friend;
however, before binding himself definitely, he wished to find out, on
his own account, something about the state of the country, and for
this purpose to make a trial voyage."&mdash;Rochemonteix's Les J√©suites
et la Nouvelle France (Paris, 1896), vol. i., p. 11.

Pleased with Annapolis harbor, Poutrincourt decided to settle
there with his family, and De Monts gave him a grant of the place.
In 1606, Poutrincourt made a second voyage to Port Royal, exploring
the coast with Champlain and Lescarbot. After the abandonment
of the colony (1607), he went to France, returning to Acadia
in 1610, inspired with zeal to convert the savages, but without
the aid of the Jesuits. See Parkman's Pioneers of France in the
New World (ed. 1885, which will hereafter be cited, unless otherwise
noted), pp. 244-322; also Shea's ed. of Charlevoix's History of
New France, vol. i., p. 260. By the destruction of Port Royal in
1613, he was the heaviest loser&mdash;the total loss to the French, according
to Charlevoix, being a hundred thousand crowns. In 1614,
Poutrincourt visited the ruins of Port Royal for the last time, thence
returning to France to engage in the service of the king. He was
fatally wounded by a treacherous shot after the taking of M√©ry
(1615). Baird (Hug. Emig., vol. i., p. 94), says: "This nobleman,
if nominally a Roman Catholic, appears to have been in full sympathy
with his Huguenot associates, De Monts and Lescarbot. His
hatred of the Jesuits was undisguised." Lescarbot's account of
Poutrincourt's dispute with them differs essentially from that given
by Biard, post.


3.
(p. 55)&mdash;Marc Lescarbot (or L'Escarbot), parliamentary advocate,
was born at Vervins, France, between 1570 and 1580. He
was more given to literature than to law, and appears to have been a
man of judgment, tact, and intelligence. He spent the winter of
3071606-07 at Port Royal, which Slafter (Prince Soc. ed. of Voyages
of Samuel Champlain, vol. ii., p. 22, note 56) locates "on the
north side of the bay [Annapolis Basin] in the present town of
Lower Granville; not, as often alleged, at Annapolis." See Bourinot's
"Some Old Forts by the Sea," in Trans. Royal Society of
Canada, sec. ii, pp. 72-74, for description of Port Royal, which he
places on the site of the present Annapolis. In the spring of 1607,
Lescarbot explored the coast between the harbor of St. John, N. B.,
and the River St. Croix. On the abandonment of De Monts' colony,
the same year, he returned to France, where he wrote much on
Acadia and in praise of Poutrincourt. Larousse gives the date of
his death as 1630. Parkman's Pioneers, pp. 258 et seq., gives a
lively account of Lescarbot's winter at the colony. Abb√© Faillon,
in Histoire de la Colonie Fran√ßaise en Canada (Montreal, 1865),
vol. i, p. 91, says he has given us the best accounts extant (in the
present document, his Histoire de la Nouvelle France, 1609, and
his Les Muses de la Nouvelle France, 1618) of the enterprises of
De Monts and Poutrincourt; and that while a Catholic in name,
he was a Huguenot at heart.


4.
 (p. 57)&mdash;Clameur de Haro, Chartre Normand, an expression
used in all the privileges or licenses granted by the king to
booksellers. The latter phrase refers to a deed containing numerous
privileges or concessions, accorded to the inhabitants of Normandy
by Louis X., Mar. 19, 1313, and repeatedly confirmed afterward.
Haro is supposed to be derived from, Ha Rou! or Ha Rollo!
Hence an appeal to Rollo, the first Duke of Normandy.


5.
 (p. 59)&mdash;The first attempt of the Huguenots to establish a
colony in America was at Rio Janeiro, under Villegagnon (1555).
A reinforcement was sent thither in 1557, and among its Calvinist
preachers was Jean de L√©ri, the historian of the disastrous undertaking.
See his Historia Navigationis in Brasiliam (1586), quoted
in Parkman's Pioneers, p. 28.


6.
 (p. 61)&mdash;The St. Lawrence; so named by Cartier (1535), but
frequently called "The Great River," "The River of the Great
Bay," etc., by early annalists. In the account of his second voyage,
Cartier styles it le grand fleuve de Hochelaga. See Winsor's
Narrative and Critical History of America, vol. iv., p. 163;
also his Cartier to Frontenac, p. 28.


7.
(p. 61)&mdash;Concerning early European acquaintance with American
Indians:

"In the yeere 1153 ... it is written, that there came to Lubec,
a citie of Germanie, one Canoa with certaine Indians, like vnto a
long barge: which seemed to haue come from the coast of Baccalaos,
which standeth in the same latitude that Germanie doth." (Antoine
308Galvano, in Goldsmid's ed. of Hakluyt's Voyages, vol. xvi., p. 293.)

Harrisse (Bibliotheca Americana Vetustissima, no. 71) cites the
Chronicon of Eusebius (Paris, 1512) as having, "under the date 1509,
a notice saying that there had been brought to Rouen seven Savages
from North America."

The Indians of Newfoundland, when first discovered by the
French, called codfish bacalos, which Lescarbot and other early
French writers say is identical with the Basque word for codfish.
Many evidences led Cartier, upon his first voyage (1534), to believe
that the natives had had previous intercourse with Europeans.


8.
 (p. 61)&mdash;Probably Andr√© Thevet. A translation of his description
of the Isles of Demons (now known as Belle Isle and Quirpon),
is given in Parkman's Pioneers, p. 191. Thevet's Cosmographie
Universelle (Paris, 1558), and Singularitez de la France
antarctique (Paris, 1558), must have been familiar to Lescarbot.
De Costa gives a translation of so much of the Cosmographie as
relates to New England, in Magazine of American History, vol.
viii., p. 130: "The production of the mendacious monk, Andr√©
Thevet." It seems clear that Thevet never saw the American
coast, that his imagination amplified the accounts of navigators who
had visited the region, particularly those of Cartier. Priceless as
are first editions of Thevet, he has a poor reputation for veracity.

9. (p. 61)&mdash;The Armouchiquois (or Almouchiquois of Champlain)
were, according to Parkman (Jesuits of N. America, p. xxi.), the
Algonkin tribes of New England,&mdash;Mohicans, Pequots, Massachusetts,
Narragansetts, and others,&mdash;"in a chronic state of war with
the tribes of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia." Williamson,
in History of the State of Maine (Hallowell, 1832, vol. i., p. 477),
says they were an Etchemin tribe, the Marechites of the St. John
River; but Champlain, who had, like Biard, visited the Armouchiquois
country, says that it lies beyond Cho√ºacoet (Saco), and that the
language is different from those of the Souriquois and Etchemins.
Laverdi√®re affirms that "the French called Almouchiquois several
peoples or tribes that the English included under the term Massachusetts;"
and he conjectures that these two names are etymologically
allied.&mdash;See his Champlain, pp. 200, 205, 206.

10. (p. 61)&mdash;Lescarbot here refers to his Histoire de la Nouvelle
France. The first edition (Paris, 1609) is a rare prize to collectors,&mdash;a
London catalogue of 1878 pricing it at ¬£45. The edition of
1612 is followed in the Tross reprint (Paris, 1866); that of 1618
contains Lescarbot's assault upon the Jesuits. The fourth and
sixth books, only, were "translated out of the French into English"
by P. Erondelle, 1609. A German version of a brief summary of
the work appeared in 1613.

309

11. (p. 67)&mdash;The term Norembega, variously spelled, was applied
indifferently to the entire range of Acadian and New England
coast; but apparently the Penobscot is here meant. See Winsor's
N. and C. Hist., vol. iv., index; Documentary History of State of
Maine, vol. ii., pp. lii., liii.; Prince Society's ed. of Champlain,
memoir and index. The claim is made for Bangor, Me., that it is
on the site of an ancient town called Norumbega. Much information
on this point is given in Maine Hist. Soc. Colls., vols. ii., iv.,
v., vii., viii., and ix. Sewall claims that the true form of Norumbegua
is Ar√¢mbec, and that it was the name of a city of the savages,
situated near the head-waters of the Damariscotta, above Pemaquid.&mdash;Ancient
Dominions of Maine, pp. 30-46. Horsford, in
Discovery of the Ancient City of Norembega and Defences of
Norembega (Boston, 1890 and 1891), claims, on slender evidence,
that Watertown, Mass., occupies the site of an old town of that
name founded by Norse vikings in 1000 A. D.

12. (p. 67)&mdash;Bay of Fundy; first shown on map of Diego Homem
(1558); named by De Monts Grande Baye Fran√ßaise (shown on Lescarbot's
chart of Port Royal); appears as Argal's Bay, on Alexander's
map (1624); Golfo di S. Luize, on Dudley's (1647); Fundi
Bay, on Moll's (1712); and Bay of Fundy, or Argal, on that of the
English and French Commissioners (1755). Bourinot (Canad. Mo.,
vol. vii., p. 292) says that Fundy is a corruption of Fond de la Baie,
as the lower part of the bay was called; he follows here Ferland's
suggestion, in Cours d'Histoire du Canada (Quebec, 1861), vol.
i., p. 65.

13. (p. 67)&mdash;The son of Pontgrav√©, who, according to Parkman
(Pioneers, p. 290) had exasperated the Indians by an outrage on
one of their women, and had fled to the woods.

14. (p. 69)&mdash;Palourdes is Breton for a kind of shellfish.

15. (p. 73)&mdash;The Souriquois, or Micmacs, of Nova Scotia. Champlain's
map of 1632 places them east of Port Royal.

16. (p. 73)&mdash;Raphael Maffei, Maffeus Volaterranus, or Raffaello
Volterrano, savant and historian; born in Volterra 1451, died 1521
or 1522. Harrisse (Bib. Amer. Vet., p. 88) gives a catalogue of
his works, and says, "The Commentary of Maffei has a peculiar
interest from the fact that it preceded the publication of Peter
Martyr's Decades" (1511-46).

Laverdi√®re (Champlain, p. 70, note) says that sagamo is a Montagnais
word; and he cites Lafl√®che as deriving it from tchi and
okimau, meaning "great chief."

17. (p. 73)&mdash;Berosus (325-255 B. C., circa), a Chaldean priest,
astrologer, and historian. His best known work is the Babylonica,
a history of Babylonia; its remaining fragments have been reproduced
310by several European writers, especially in Richter's Berosi
Chald. Histori√¶ quae supersunt (Leipsic, 1825).

18. (p. 75)&mdash;The Tolosains were a tribe of the Volc√¶ of Gaul.
Another tribe of the Volc√¶ were the Tectosages&mdash;so called from
their sagum (frock or cloak).

19. (p. 75)&mdash;Membertou was chief of all the Micmac groups from
Gasp√© to Cape Sable. Champlain writes, that he was "a friendly
savage, although he had the name of being the worst and most
traitorous man of his tribe." Lescarbot called him "the chef
d'&oelig;uvre of Christian piety," and Biard had strong faith in him.
He claimed to remember the first visit of Cartier (1534).

20. (p. 77)&mdash;Biard, six years later, complains bitterly of this
overhaste in baptizing, declaring that these savages, when he went
among them in 1611, did not know the first principles of the Faith,
and had even forgotten their Christian names.

21. (p. 81)&mdash;In the original edition, pp. 25 and 26, apparently
through an error in make-up, are verbal repetitions of the two preceding
pages. This duplication has been omitted in the present
edition.

22. (p. 105)&mdash;Marked changes occurred in the population of the
St. Lawrence valley, between the visits of Cartier (1535) and Champlain
(1603). Morgan, in League of the Iroquois (Rochester, 1851),
p. 5, maintains the correctness of a tradition that the aborigines
whom Cartier found at Hochelaga were Iroquois, and that they then
were subject to the Algonkins, whom Champlain found in possession
of the valley. Cf. Parkman's Pioneers, p. 208, and Schoolcraft's
Hist. of Indian Tribes of the U. S., vol. vi., pp. 33, 188. For
further treatment of the migrations of the Iroquois, see Introduction
to Hale's Iroquois Book of Rites (Phila., 1883), and Faillon's Col.
Fr., vol. i., pp. 524, et seq.

23. (p. 107)&mdash;Tabagie. A feast described fully in one of the later
Relations.

24. (p. 107)&mdash;This easy victory of the French and Algonkins over
the Iroquois (July 29, 1609), on the western shores of Lake Champlain,
cost New France dearly, as it secured for the struggling
colony the deadly enmity of the most warlike savages on the continent,
for nearly a century and a half. It was impossible for New
France to make permanent headway when sapped by such an
enemy. Slafter's exhaustive notes to Champlain's Voyages
(Prince Soc.), vol. i., p. 91, and vol. ii., p. 223, make it clear that the
site of this momentous skirmish was Ticonderoga.

25. (p. 109)&mdash;Jess√© Fl√©ch√©, a secular priest from the diocese of
Langres, was invited by Poutrincourt to accompany the first colony
to Acadia. The papal nuncio gave him authority to absolve in all
311cases, except those reserved to the pope.&mdash;Faillon's Col. Fr., vol.
i., p. 99. Poutrincourt evidently meant to Christianize Acadia without
the aid of the Jesuits. The wholesale baptism of savages by
Fl√©ch√©, before the arrival of Biard and Mass√©, was, according to
Faillon (Ibid., vol. i., p. 100), condemned as a profanation by good
Catholics, "tous les th√©ologiens, and notamment la Sorbonne."&mdash;Cf.
also note 19, ante, and Sagard's Histoire du Canada, p. 97. He
had been at Port Royal nearly a year before the arrival of the
Jesuits. The name is variously spelled: Fleche, Fl√©che, Fl√®che,
Fl√©ch√©, Flesche, Fleuchy, and Fleuche; see Sulte's Poutrincourt en
Acadie, p. 38. See Bourinot's picturesque description of the baptismal
scene, in Can. Royal Soc. Trans., sec. ii, p. 73. Fl√©ch√© was
much esteemed by the Micmacs; his nickname, "Le Patriarch," is
still current among them corrupted into "Patliasse," as the name
for a priest.&mdash;See Ferland's Cours d'Histoire (Quebec, 1861), vol.
i, p. 80.

26. (p. 127)&mdash;The four letters here given (Biard, Jan. 21, June 10,
and June 11, 1611; and Mass√©, June 11, 1611) are from Carayon's
Premi√®re Mission des J√©suites au Canada: Lettres et Documents
In√©dits (Paris, 1864). All of the documents in Carayon's collection
will be published in this series, in chronological order, with that
Editor's valuable footnotes.

Auguste Carayon, S. J., a leading authority upon the history of
his order in New France, was born in Saumur, France, 1813, and
died in Poitiers, 1874. His principal works were: Bibliographie
historique de la Compagnie de J√©sus; Catalogue des ouvrages
relatifs √† l'histoire des J√©suites depuis leur origine jusqu'√†
nos jours (Paris, 1864); Documents in√©dits concernant la Compagnie
de J√©sus (Poitiers, 1863-1875, 18 vols.); Premi√®re Mission
des J√©suites au Canada (Paris, 1864); Bannissement des
J√©suites de la Louisiane (Paris, 1865); √âtablissement de la Compagnie
de J√©sus √† Brest, par Louis XIV. (1865); Prisons du
Marquis de Pombal, ministre du Portugal, journal de 1759 √†
1777 (1865); Notes historiques sur les parlements et les J√©suites
au dix-huiti√®me si√©cle (1867). Carayon also edited numerous important
historical works, between 1864 and 1871.

27. (p. 127)&mdash;Pierre Biard, S. J., writer of several of the early
Acadian Relations, was born at Grenoble, France, 1567, and died at
Avignon, November 17, 1622. In 1608, he was called from a chair
of scholastic theology and Hebrew, in Lyons, by Father Coton,
the King's confessor and preacher, to take charge of the Jesuit
mission in Acadia. His several accounts of the colony, with the
part taken by himself in notable episodes, do not always agree
with the version of Lescarbot. See Parkman's Pioneers, part ii.,
312chaps, v.-viii.; also, R. P. Felix Martin's Life of R. P. Pierre
Biard, S. J. (Montreal, 1890).

28. (p. 127)&mdash;Claude Aquaviva, S. J., born 1544; elected general
of the Society of Jesus, 1581; died, 1615; a Neapolitan nobleman;
chamberlain of the Court of Rome; fifth general of the order, and
ranked by some historians as its ablest legislator and second
founder. See Nicolini's History of the Jesuits, pp. 210, 257.

29. (p. 127)&mdash;Fathers Biard and Mass√© sailed January 26.

30. (p. 129)&mdash;Brother-coadjutor. The six classes of the order
of Jesuits were: (1) novices, (2) lay-brothers, (3) scholars, (4) coadjutors,
(5) Jesuits of the Third Order, and (6) Jesuits of the Fourth
Order. See Thomas D'Arcy McGee's Lecture on the Jesuits.

31. (p. 133)&mdash;Biencourt and Robin de Coulogne, not having means
to equip and provision the vessel which was to convey Biard and
Mass√© to Port Royal, made an arrangement with Dujardin and
Duquesne, two merchants of Dieppe, by which the latter undertook
to furnish the equipment and supplies in consideration of being admitted
as partners in Poutrincourt's fur-trading and cod-fishing
enterprise. Concerning this Contract d'Association des J√©suites
au Trafique du Canada, made January 20, 1611, see Parkman's
Pioneers, p. 288, note. Cf. also, Rochemonteix's J√©suites, vol. i.,
p. 32. These partners, being Huguenots, objected to the shipment
of the Jesuits, but finally sold their interests for 2,800 livres to
Madame de Guercheville, whose part in this expedition is related in
note 33, post. See Biard's succeeding letter, for fuller details of
this adventure.

32. (p. 133)&mdash;Formal order of the Queen. October 7, 1610, the
young King, Louis XIII., wrote from Monceaux to Baron de Poutrincourt:
"Monsieur de Poutrincourt, as Father Pierre Biard and
Father Ennemond Mass√©, religious of the Society of Jesus, are being
sent over to New France to celebrate the divine services of the
church and to preach the Gospel to the people of that country, I
wish to hereby recommend them to you, that you may, upon all occasions,
assist and protect them in the exercise of their noble and
holy calling, assuring you that I shall consider it a great service."

The Queen Mother also wrote: "Monsieur de Poutrincourt, now
that the good Jesuit Fathers are about to try, under the authority
of the King, my son, to establish our faith over there, I hereby
request you to give them, for the success of this good work, all the
courtesy and assistance in your power, as a service very near our
heart, and very acceptable to us, praying God, Monsieur de Poutrincourt,
to keep you under his holy and watchful care."&mdash;David
Asseline's Antiquities and Chronicles of the City of Dieppe
313(Dieppe, 1874; 2 vols.) The letters are reproduced in Faillon's Col.
Fr., vol. i., p. 102.

33. (p. 135)&mdash;Antoinette de Pons, Marquise de Guercheville, patroness
of Jesuit missions in New France, was lady of honor to Marie
de M√©dicis, and accounted one of the most beautiful and zealously
religions women of her time. Taking up the defence of the Jesuits
against Poutrincourt, she not only bought the ship in which to transport
them to America, but the cargo and the royal patent of De
Monts, thus succeeding the latter as proprietor of all Acadia, excepting
Port Royal, which still remained in Poutrincourt's possession.
Concerning her rupture with De Monts, see Shea's Charlevoix,
vol. i., p. 274. She resolved to plant a strictly Catholic colony at
Pentagoet (site of Bangor, Me.), and sent out, under La Saussaye,
some fifty settlers and three Jesuit missionaries (1613). Upon
reaching Port Royal, they were joined by Biard and Mass√©, and
thence proceeded to the eastern side of Mount Desert Island. For
the location of their mission, St. Sauveur, see Parkman's Pioneers,
p. 304, note. The descent of the English under Argall (1613),
was the end of Madame de Guercheville's mission. See N. Y.
Colonial Documents, vol. iii., pp. 1, 2, concerning reparation allowed
her by the government of Great Britain for the loss of her
vessel. Cf. Faillon's Col. Fr., vol. i., pp. 110-117; and Baird's Hug.
Emig., vol. i., p. 103. Upon the queen regent's high regard for the
Jesuits, see Col. Fr., vol. i., pp. 101, 102.

34. (p. 141)&mdash;Several of the old French coins were called √©cus.
They date from the period of Charles VII.,&mdash;√©cus √† la couronne,
or crowns of gold, from the crown which formed the type of the
reverse.&mdash;Prime's Coins, Medals, and Seals, p. 150. The √©cu of
Louis XIV. is first given in Dye's Coin Encyclopedia, p. 621; value
in United States currency, $1.10S. The early √©cu was equal to three
francs; later, to about five.

35. (p. 141)&mdash;Viaticum. In P√®re de Ravignan's On the Existence
and Institutions of the Jesuits (Paris, 1862), p. 190, note ii.,
mention is made of a custom in connection with the viaticum of missionaries,
which was frequently observed at this time. The founders
or benefactors of missions, in order to obtain with greater certainty
and abundance the money which they intended for missionary
work in distant lands, charged the merchants, who acted as
agents, to sell the merchandise which they consigned to them, and
to remit the price of it to the missionaries for their support. Thus
Madame de Guercheville furnished considerable money to Biencourt
to invest in the fish and fur trade, which he was about to undertake,
with the sole condition that, for her share, he should support
314the missionaries. See Rochemonteix's J√©suites, vol. i., pp.
35-36, note.

36. (p. 141)&mdash;The Marchioness de Verneuil furnished their chapel,
Madame de Sourdis their vestments and linen, and Madame de
Guercheville provided other necessaries.&mdash;Annu√¶ Litter√¶ S. J., an.
1612, p. 570.

Madame de Verneuil founded a convent of Annunciades, and gave
her declining years to religion. She died at Paris, 1633, aged 54.

37. (p. 143)&mdash;In his Relation of 1616, chap, xi., Biard says:
"Thomas Robin de Coulogne enjoyed a modest fortune; he had
often heard about New France from the Dieppe merchants, and had
wished to mingle in this colonization movement. What Baron de
Poutrincourt told him about the attempts made at Port Royal
pleased him greatly, and he promised to assist him."

The names of Monsieur de Coullogne (Coulogne) and of Madame
de Sigogne (Sicoine) appear in Fl√©ch√©'s list of baptisms, ante. Other
contemporary spellings of Coulogne are: Cologne, Coloigne, and
Coloine.

38. (p. 147)&mdash;This is an interesting, and we believe a unique statement
of Biard, that the islands off the Gulf of St. Lawrence were
once called the "Azores of the Great Bank." The maps of many
early cartographers and navigators represent Newfoundland as a
group of islands, or a large island with a circlet of smaller ones, or
"almost a single island."&mdash;See Winsor's N. and C. Hist., vol. i.,
pp. 74, 77, 79, 93, 379. As Newfoundland was the first land sighted
by voyagers in New France, and as their last sight of land had been
the Azores, the naming of the islands on the Great Bank the Azores
is in keeping with their custom in this regard.

39. (p. 149)&mdash;Ennemond Mass√©, S. J., born at Lyons, 1574; died at
Sillery, Canada, 1646; admitted to the Society of Jesus at the age of
twenty, and assigned to a chair of theology in Lyons; in 1608,
chosen by Father Coton to accompany Biard to Acadia. He was
again sent to Canada in 1625, with Charles Lalemant, Jean de
Br√©beuf, and two lay brothers. During the English occupation of
Canada (1629-32), he was in France, but returned with Br√©beuf in
1633. Rochemonteix (J√©suites, vol. i., p. 24). says of him: "Of
an impetuous and violent nature, he had all he could do to restrain
it. But, by vigilance and perseverance, he conquered it so well
that he no longer seemed to have any strong impulses or passions.
Industrious, unwearying, of robust health, he was prepared for the
hardships of a distant mission by a life of penitence and denial,
frequently fasting, sleeping upon hard boards, accustoming his taste
to everything, and his body to extreme cold and heat. Although
innocent as a child, he led the life of a penitential anchorite; in
3151608, they made him an Associate to Father Coton, then confessor
and preacher to the king. But this austere apostle preferred a life
of privation and sacrifice to that of the court. He chose Canada."
Bressani's Relatione, to be given post, describes the death of Mass√©,
who was one of the most notable of the missionaries of New
France. A monument to his memory has been erected at Sillery.
There is a difference of usage in the matter of accenting his name:
Charlevoix, Winsor, and Parkman do not use the accent; but Champlain,
Biard, and Cretineau-Joly do, and Faillon (Col. Fr., vol. i., p.
101) gives authorities for this usage, which we have preferred to
adopt.

40. (p. 151)&mdash;Bourinot (Canad. Mo., vol. vii., p. 292) says
Canso is a Souriquois word meaning "facing the frowning cliff;"
also, that "the strait was long called after the Sieur de Fronsac,
one of the early gentlemen adventurers who held large estates in
Acadia." It is shown as detroit de Fronsac on Chabert's map
(1750); it is Camceau on Champlain's map of 1632; it sometimes
appears as Campceau on old French documents; and is spelled both
Canceaux and Canso in the official correspondence between France
and England in the eighteenth century. In 1779, the fisheries of
Canso were worth ¬£50,000 a year to England. See Murdoch's
History of Nova Scotia (Halifax, 1865-67), vol. ii, p. 597.

41. (p. 151)&mdash;Lescarbot states that they arrived at night, three
hours after sunset.&mdash;Relation derni√®re (Bans, 1612), to be given
post.

42. (p. 153)&mdash;Cap de la H√®ve, now known as Cape La Have, is the
southern point of La Have Island, off New Dublin Bay, one of
many indentations of the coast of the township of New Dublin,
Lunenburg County, Nova Scotia. The cape is a picturesque cliff or
bluff rising 107 feet above tide level, and visible a long distance out
to sea. When De Monts and Champlain left Havre de Gr√¢ce, France,
in March, 1604, Cap de la H√®ve, in the suburb of St. Adresse,
must have been the last land seen by them; as this cliff off New
Dublin was probably the first sighted by them in La Cadie, it was
natural that they should name it after the famous French landmark.
There are evidences on La Have Island of an early French settlement,
of which there appear to be no records; although it is known
that Saussaye planted a cross there, May 16, 1613. De Laet, in describing
Cadie (1633) says: "Near Cap de la H√®ve lies a port of
the same name, 44¬∞ 5' north latitude, with safe anchorage."&mdash;See
Des Brisay's Hist. of Co. of Lunenburg, N. S. (2d ed., Toronto,
1895), pp. 166 et seq. The Editor is also indebted to F. Blake
Crofton, secretary of the Nova Scotia Historical Society, for information
under this head.

316

43. (p. 163)&mdash;People from St. Malo, France. Spelled also by
Biard, post, Malouines.

44. (p. 169)&mdash;Robert, the son of Pontgrav√©, who had escaped from
custody, and had been in hiding in the forest. See Parkman's
Pioneers, pp. 265, 290; also, Lescarbot's reference to him, ante.

45. (p. 181)&mdash;Referring to Queen Blanche of Castile (1187-1252),
regent after the death of her husband, Louis VIII., during the
absence of her son, Louis IX. (Saint Louis), in the Holy Land.

46. (p. 197)&mdash;Joseph Jouvency (also written Juvency, Jouvenci,
and Jouvancy), Jesuit historian, an eminent litterateur of his time.
Born in Paris, September 14, 1643; died at Rome, May 29, 1719. In
1659, he was admitted to the Society of Jesus, for many years filling
the position of professor of rhetoric at La Fl√®che, and devoting
much time to historical and classical research. After taking his vows
in 1677, he was sent to Rome, as one of the staff of writers upon
Historia Societatis Jesu.

47. (p. 197)&mdash;Count Ernest von Mansfeld, soldier of fortune, conspicuous
in the Thirty Years War. Born, 1585; died, 1626, soon
after his defeat by Wallenstein at the bridge of Dessau. His great
army of mercenaries was, according to Motley (John of Barneveld,
vol. ii., p. 32), "the earliest type, perhaps, of the horrible military
vermin destined to feed so many years on the unfortunate
dismembered carcass of Germany." Cf. Kohlrausch's History of
Germany (Haas trans.), pp. 320, 326. Concerning the campaign
of Louis XIII., against the Huguenots (1622), and Count von Mansfeld's
part therein, see Kitchin's History of France, pp. 497, 498.

48. (p. 199)&mdash;Philip Alegambe, a Jesuit scholar (Flemish). Died
in 1652, while superior of the house of his order at Rome. He was
the leading writer upon Bibliotheca Scriptorum Societatis Jesu
(1643).

49. (p. 219)&mdash;Seven Islands. A group at the mouth of the St.
Lawrence River, near the northerly shore of the gulf.

50. (p. 219)&mdash;Chicoutimi River, rising in numerous small lakes
near Lake St. John, pursues a picturesque course, frequently interrupted
by rapids, eastward and northeastward into the Saguenay.
At the junction, seventy-five miles above the mouth of the latter, is
now the important lumber-shipping port of Chicoutimi, at whose
wharves ocean-going vessels are laden. The old missionary district
of that name included the rugged country lying south and southwest
of Lake St. John.

51. (p. 221)&mdash;The French Jesuits definitely abandoned the Iroquois
field in 1687, owing to the rising power of the English. In
1701, Bruyas was again on the ground, being joined the year following
by De Lamberville, Garnier, and Le Valliant, and later by
317D'Hue and De Marieul. The entire party was driven out in 1708,
and many of their Iroquois converts retired with them to the mission
of Caughnawaga, near Montreal.

52. (p. 221)&mdash;The Iroquois Mission of St. Francis Xavier was
founded in 1669 by Iroquois Christians,&mdash;emigrants from the
"castles" of the Five Nations. The mission was finally removed
to Sault St. Louis, on the St. Lawrence, and called Caughnawaga,
from the Indian village of that name on the Mohawk, where had also
been a Jesuit mission.

53. (p. 221)&mdash;Lake Michigan. Called Lac des Puants on Champlain's
map of 1632, in reference to the Winnebago tribe (Puants) on
Green Bay; in several of the Relations, and on Marquette's map
(1674), it is styled Lac des Illinois, from the Illinois Indians upon its
southern coast; Allouez calls it (1675) Lac St. Joseph, because of
Fort and River St. Josephs on the southeast coast; Coronelli's map
(1688) honors the Dauphin by calling the lake after him; Hennepin
comes the nearest to modern usage, in his name, Michigonong.

54. (p. 221)&mdash;Lake Huron, which has figured under many titles,
in the old maps and chronicles. This name has reference to the
Indian family upon its eastern shores. Champlain first named it
La Mer Douce, ("The Fresh Sea"), and later Lac des Attigouantan,
after the chief tribe of the Hurons; Sanson's map (1657) names it
Karegnondi; Coronelli's map (1688) christens it Lac d'Orleans;
Colden in one place gives it as Quatoghe, and in another as Caniatare.
Lac des Hurons first appears in the map accompanying the
Relation for 1670-71.

55. (p. 221)&mdash;The mission of St. Ignace was founded by Marquette,
in 1670, on Point St. Ignace, on the mainland north of and
opposite the Island of Michillimackinac (now shortened to Mackinaw
or Mackinac, as fancy dictates). The term Michillimackinac,
variously spelled, was applied by the earliest French not only to the
island and straits of that name, but in general to the great peninsula
lying north of the straits.

56. (p. 221)&mdash;The mission of Sault Ste. Marie, at the outlet of
Lake Superior, was founded by Raimbault and Jogues in 1640.
The place was always an important rallying-point for the natives,
and naturally became the center of a wide-spreading fur trade,
which lasted, under French, English, and American dominations in
turn, until about 1840.

57. (p. 221)&mdash;The Western mission of St. Francis Xavier was
founded by Allouez in 1669, at the first rapids in the Fox River (of
Green Bay), on the east side of the river, in what is now the city of
Depere, Wis. An important Indian village had from the earliest
historic times been located there.

58. (p. 223)&mdash;Outaouaki = Ottawas; Puteatamis = Pottawattomies;
Kikarous = Kickapoos; Outagamies = Foxes; Oumiamis = Miamis.

59. (p. 223)&mdash;Bayagoulas, one of the Louisiana missions, of which
Father Paul du Ru, S. J., was in charge in 1700. Shea's Catholic
Missions, p. 443.

60. (p. 227)&mdash;An anonymous writer in The Catholic World,
(vol. xii., p. 629) makes the statement that Quentin and Du Thet
were sent out to replace Biard and Mass√© "if they had perished;
otherwise to return to France." Contemporary writers, however,
speak of their coming as a reinforcement.

61. (p. 227)&mdash;On what came to be known as Frenchman's Bay, on
the east side of the island of Mount Desert. Parkman says (Pioneers,
ed. 1865, p. 276, note): "Probably all of Frenchman's Bay
was included under the name of the Harbor of St. Sauveur. The
landing-place so called seems to have been near the entrance of the
bay, certainly south of Bar Harbor. The Indian name of the Island
of Mount Desert was Penetic. Its present name was given by
Champlain."

62. (p. 227)&mdash;The "Jonas," conspicuous in the annals of Acadia
from the time in which Poutrincourt and Lescarbot sailed in her for
Port Royal, in 1606, to her capture by Argall in 1613. Parkman
aptly calls her "the 'Mayflower' of the Jesuits."

63. (p. 229)&mdash;Samuel Argall, born in Bristol, England, 1572; died,
1639. See Cooke's Virginia (Amer. Commonwealths ser.), pp.
111-113, for a fair estimate of this tempestuous character. Folsom's
"Expedition of Captain Samuel Argal," to N. Y. Hist. Colls. (new
ser.); vol. i., pp. 333-342, goes over that ground quite completely.

64. (p. 231)&mdash;Sir Thomas Dale, the predecessor of Argall as governor
of Virginia; he was in the service of the Low Countries,
1588-95, and 1606-10; in 1611, he entered the service of the Virginia
Company, where he remained five years as governor of the colony;
and in 1619 he died at Masulipatam, while in command of an expedition
to the East Indies.

65. (p. 233)&mdash;The charge was freely made at the time, that Biard
and Mass√©, incensed at Biencourt, who had been unkind to them,
piloted Argall to Port Royal. Poutrincourt and Lescarbot, disliking
the Jesuits, naturally believed it, and the former addressed the
French admiralty court on the subject, under the date of July 18,
1614.&mdash;See Lescarbot's Nouv. France, book v., chap. 14. Champlain
discredited the charge, saying that Argall compelled an Indian
to serve as pilot. Cf. Parkman's Pioneers, pp. 313 et seq., and
Biard's own statements, post (Letter to T.-R. G√©n√©ral, May 6,
1614; and Relation of 1616).

66. (p. 233)&mdash;Argall's lieutenant, in command of the captured
"Jonas." According to Parkman (Pioneers, p. 318), he was "an
officer of merit, a scholar, and linguist," treating his prisoners with
kindness.

67. (p. 251)&mdash;Reference is here made to Lake Champlain, the Mer
des Iroquois and Lacus Irocoisiensis of the early French cartographers.
Richelieu River was at first styled Rivi√®re des Iroquois.
In a letter of John Winthrop to Lord Arlington, dated Boston, Oct.
25, 1666, Lake Champlain is referred to as Lake Hiracoies.&mdash;N. Y.
Colon. Docs., iii., p. 138. See also, Palmer's History of Lake
Champlain (Albany, 1866), pp. 12, 13; and Blaeu's maps of 1662 and
1685, in Winsor's N. and C. Hist., vol. iv., p. 391.

68. (p. 253)&mdash;The gar-pike (Lepidosteus osseus). A picture of
this "armored fish" is given in Creuxius's Historia Canadensis
(Paris, 1664), p. 50.

69. (p. 253)&mdash;Jouvency plainly refers to what is still known as
Bird Island, of Bird Rocks, in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, N. W. of
Cabot Strait. Authorities disagree in locating the Bird Island of
Cartier's first voyage. See Hakluyt's Voyages (Goldsmid ed.),
vol. xiii., pt. i, p. 78; Shea's Charlevoix, vol. i., p. 112, note; both
indicating that what is now called Funk Island, off the eastern coast
of Newfoundland, was the Bird Island of Cartier. Kingsford, in
History of Canada (Toronto, 1887), vol. i., p. 3, identifies it, however,
with the present Bird Island of the Gulf. Champlain's map
of 1613 has a Bird Island near the mouth of the Bay of Fundy.
Anspach, in History of Newfoundland (London, 1819), p. 317, says:
"Fogo Island [N. W. of Cape Freels] is described in the old maps
by the name of Aves, or Birds' Island."

70. (p. 269)&mdash;The Montagnais, a wretched tribe of nomads, were,
at this time, chiefly centered upon the banks of the Saguenay River.

71. (p. 281)&mdash;Venus mercenaria, the round clam, or quahaug.

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
