HOW "A DEAR LITTLE COUPLE"
WENT ABROAD.




CHAPTER I.

POLLY THINKS OVER HER "SURPRISE."






LLY opened her blue eyes one lovely morning
in May, and found the "sun fairies"       as she
called them       dancing all about her wee bed-chamber,
and telling her in their own bright
way that it was high time little girls were up
and dressing for breakfast.

At first she was sure she had been having
a beautiful dream, for what else
could make her feel so happy and "sort
of all-overish," as if something very
nice and unusual had come upon her?
She was sure she had dreamed that a
splendid surprise had happened, and
it was something about going away,
too!

Polly lay still in her little white
nest of a bed, and thought over her
dream, and lo! on a sudden, as she
grew more and more awake, the real
cause of her new and glad sensations
came into her curly head, and she bounced, like a little rubber ball,
right out of bed, and danced a wee lively jig on the floor.

Why, of course it wasn't a dream! No, indeed! it was as real       oh!
as real as Polly Darling herself, and no wonder she had felt so[6]
"all-overish" and so "glad all inside
of her"! She sat down on the soft
carpet and drew her stockings and
shoes on, but it was slow work, because
Polly was thinking, and she
had a great deal to think about, you
see.





First       oh! how it all came back
to her now!       first she remembered
that last night after supper Papa had
taken her on his knee and whispered
in her ear: "Pollybus, how would
you like to go with Mamma and
Papa across the sea for a little trip?"

And while she was squeezing
him almost to pieces by way of answer,
Mamma had come along, and
had shaken her finger at Papa, as she
said: "Oh, naughty Papa! the idea of
telling Polly that just when she's going to bed! She won't sleep a
wink for thinking of it." And Polly remembered jumping down from
Papa's knee, and going to Mamma's side, saying very earnestly: "Oh,
yes, I will! I truly will, Mamma! I'll shut my eyes and think 'bout
little lambs jumping over a fence, 'cause Cook says that's the best way
to get sleepy, and it's worked be-yewtifully on her lots of times! Oh,
true and true, black and blue, I'll go right to sleep! And oh, I'm so
happy!"

And pretty soon after that the bed-time for little girls had come,
and Polly had been kissed and petted a little, as was usual after she
had snuggled down in bed, and had a little while alone with her dear
Mamma, and then she had tried very hard to keep her promise, and
"go right to sleep." But oh, dear, it had been such hard work to keep
those blue eyes shut! No matter how much she thought of the lambs
jumping, one after the other, over the imaginary fence, it did not make
her the least bit sleepy, and the lambs all seemed to scamper off to Europe[7]
as soon as they had jumped the fence, and of course Polly's
thoughts had to go flying after them. So, you see, it had really been
a long while before the little tired lids had closed over those dear soft
blue eyes, and sleep had really come. But when it did come you may be
sure it was a very sound, sweet sleep, and so when Polly awakened in
the morning it could hardly be wondered at that she thought she had
been having a beautiful dream.

She knew now that it was no dream, but a most delightful reality,
and oh, how happy she was!





She came to the end of her long "think" at last, and turned her
attention to her dressing, and just then Mamma came in to put the
finishing touches to the process, and Polly's tongue wagged so fast all
the while that it really seemed as though it were hung in the middle,
like a little sweet-toned bell, and able to swing both ways.

However, Mamma patiently answered all the rapid questions, and
explained that Papa, having to go abroad on business, had decided that[8]
it would do Mamma and Polly good to go also, and be the best thing to
keep him from being lonely, of course.

And she told Polly something else that had not been told the night
before, but kept for an added "surprise" this morning, and that was
that Teddy's Mamma and Papa had given permission for Teddy to go
with Polly to Europe, as a great and wonderful treat for both little
folks. But Teddy didn't know it yet, because both Mammas thought
Polly would enjoy telling him herself and giving him a delightful
surprise.

"So you may run over right after breakfast," added Mamma,
"and tell him the good news."

This additional beautiful "surprise" was more than Polly could
bear in an ordinary way, so she just simply cried for joy (you've
heard of people doing that?), and in the midst of her tears she began
to laugh, and then she cried a little more, and it seemed a long time
before the little happy Polly settled down and was able to eat her
breakfast.[9]




CHAPTER II.

TEDDY'S SURPRISE.


PERHAPS before I go any farther I ought to explain to those of
my little friends who have not chanced to read the first book
about "The Doings of a Dear Little Couple" that Polly and
Teddy were next-door neighbors in the pretty village which was their
home, and that they had been, during all their acquaintance with each
other, most loving and devoted little chums. They were each seven
years old at the time of my last writing, but at the time of this story
had become eight-year-olders, and Teddy insisted that because their
birthdays came together they were "real truly twinses." Now I will
return to my story.

When Polly finished her breakfast and was excused from the
table, she scampered off as fast as she could down the garden till she
came to the little gap in the fence of which my first book told you, you
remember, and called: "Teddy! Ted-dee! Oh! Teddy Terry!" as loud
as she could all the while she was running.

Now, it happened that Teddy Terry was eating his breakfast at
that time, and he was just putting a piece of potato into his rosy mouth
when he heard Polly's eager voice. He swallowed that piece of potato
so fast that it nearly choked him, and when he had finally gotten it out
of the way, he said: "Please 'scuse me, Mamma, Papa!" and, slipping
from his chair, was off in a jiffy to meet his little chum, Polly.

"Oh, Teddy, come up in our tree!" cried Polly, as Teddy's curly
brown head pushed through the low gap in the dividing hedge fence.
"Come quick, quick, quick! I've got the goodest news in the world to
tell you 'bout!" She danced about on her little toes while speaking,[10]
and, Teddy's plump body having speedily followed his head, he left the
fence, and with his little companion ran for the old apple-tree which       as
you remember I told you in the first book       was the "consultation
office" of our dear little couple whenever they had any especially private
conversation with each other.

So up into the stout branches of the old tree they clambered, and
settled comfortably down in a safe fork of limbs amid a thicket of
green leaves, and then, after Teddy had followed his usual loving habit
of kissing Polly on her soft little cheek, and receiving the same sweet
greeting from her, she proceeded to tell her secret.

"I'd ask you to guess it first," she said, "but oh, Teddy Terry, you
never could in the world! It's this: You 'n' I are going to Europe with
my Papa 'n' Mamma! There! what do you think of that, Teddy
Terry? Oh, isn't it the very bestest news we could have? Aren't you
s'prised most to pieces?"

Teddy's brown eyes opened so wide that it is a wonder they did
not stretch out of shape. Surprised? well, indeed he was, and when
Polly had told him more about the matter he gave the loudest whoop-la!
he could, and then a funny thing happened       he slid off that tree and
disappeared in the wood-shed near by, and       I don't know surely       but
I think it likely he went in there to hide the tears that came to his
eyes, the tears of joy which Polly had had, you know, only Teddy
didn't want her to see him turn "cry-baby," and so he had run quickly
away. But Polly soon found him there, and together they went to see
his Mother, and then he learned more fully all about the pleasure in
store for him, and that Mamma and Papa had consented to let him go
because they had been called unexpectedly away a long distance to see
a sick relative, and it made them glad to know that their little son would
be safe and happy with Polly and her Mother and Father during that
time. Afterwards, when Teddy and Polly were again together, they
talked the coming trip over as children do, and were greatly excited
and delighted.

"I promised Mamma solermy, oh, jus' as solermy as could be,
that I'd be the goodest behaving boy your Mamma ever saw!" said
Teddy, when he and Polly, tired of jumping about and shouting[11]
"whoop!" at last sat down on the grass to talk it over, "and       and       she
said she wasn't 'fraid to trus' me at all."

"Course not," responded Polly; "you're the best that ever could be
to keep promises, and if you forget 'bout 'em, it's jus' 'cause you
couldn't truly help it."

The more they talked over the wonderful new surprise, the more
excited the dear little couple were growing, and the number of times
Teddy put soft kisses on his Polly's cheek (one of his sweet little ways
of expressing his joy, at any time, over pleasures they were to share
together) I cannot tell, but you may be sure he did not limit his kisses
in the least, dear loving little chum as he was![12]











CHAPTER III.

"STARTING DAY."


AS the days went by, the children grew very restless, wishing the
"starting day" would come. Ted's Mamma had packed his
little trunk, and marked it "T. T.," and finally, when only one
more day remained of the "between days," as the children called them,
Mr. and Mrs. Terry had bidden their little son good-bye and started
off on their own journey. So Teddy was all the more glad when the
"great day" came at last.

"Hurrah, hurrah, Polly! This is our starting day! Polly, why
don't you halloo?"

"I'm going to halloo," replied Polly: "listen!" And her voice rang
out in a clear shout which reached even down to the gate.

"Once more," cried Teddy, and this time his voice joined hers,
and Mamma, coming to the hall door, looked out to see what was
going on.



      Teddy     s Mamma had packed his little trunk.      


"It's 'cause we're so glad, Mamma dearie," replied Polly to the
question asked, "and it's our starting day, you know." She was
perched upon the piazza rail nearest the piazza of Teddy's house,
[14]and Teddy was to have breakfast with her presently. Just now he
was having his jacket well brushed by Bridget, as he stood on his
own piazza, and he was so impatient to get over to Polly that he
could hardly stand still long enough for the brushing.

"Goin' inter the dirty wudshed just to see 'bout that tricircle," said
Bridget, grumbling as she brushed, "an' s'ilin' this bran' new suit yer
Ma bought for yer trav'lin'! I told yer I'd put it safe away!"

"Well, I wanted to see if you hadn't only thought you'd put it
safe," explained Teddy, who had considered it a very manly thing to investigate
his affairs himself, and had consequently gotten his new
clothes into disgrace.

"There now, yer clane and swate as a rose, an' it's ould Bridgie
who'll be missin' the trouble of yersel', an' for sure'll be wantin' some
more of that same!" said the good woman, giving him a parting hug
and pat before he was off to join Polly. At half-past nine the carriage
was to come for them and their trunks, and they would catch the ten
a. m. train for New York, and say good-bye to their pretty village
home for a long time. It was truly a very exciting morning, and
Polly's mood for rhyming was so strong that she finally accomplished
this wonderful couplet, which Teddy admired as much as she did herself.
It ran this way:       


"Oh, Teddy Terry! we're going away!
For this       this       this is our starting day!"


So Ted caught the rhyme, and joined in the singing of it, and if
it was sung once, it certainly was sung twenty times, till at last Papa
put his head out of the window and asked "if they would mind giving
him and the neighbors something new?"

Breakfast over, the little couple sat down on the sofa in the hall
and watched the clock, and at last the little hammer inside lifted itself
and struck against the bell waiting beside it, and lo and behold! there
came the carriage, driving up the road, and through the big gate, and
up to the door. Then the trunks were put on the rack behind (while
Teddy watched closely to see that the man did not forget to go and
get the "T. T." little trunk).[15]





Bridget and Ann were on
hand to say the last good-byes,
Mamma gave a few last directions,
and entered the carriage,
Papa poked the small couple in,
topsy-turvy style, got in himself,
called out good-bye to the servants,
who were wiping their
eyes with the corners of their
aprons, and       the long-anticipated
"start" had taken place.

Polly was radiant. She
hugged Papa, squeezed Mamma,
threw her arms around Teddy,
and kissed him over and over
(getting as many kisses from
him as she gave, you may be
sure), and finally settled down
with a long sigh of deep, pure
content, and said "she was so
happy she felt crowded inside of her, right up to her throat!" And
Teddy, not willing to feel different from Polly, said: "So do I!"

I won't be able to tell you very much of the short journey to the
city of New York, for I've neither time nor space for it. But you
know Polly and Teddy were just like you, my dear little girls and boys,
and they enjoyed the few hours of train ride past fields and villages,
hills and meadows, and all the various kinds of landscape views, they
watched from the windows of their car, just as much as you have enjoyed
such little trips; and, moreover, they were just as restless and
fidgety       when feeling that they wanted to have a good run about,
and couldn't "because they were shut up in a railroad car so long!"       as
all little folks (who are real live little folks) are apt to get under
such circumstances. But the cars sped on and on, and after a while
they rushed pell-mell into a long dark tunnel, which Polly at once[16]
recognized as the "beginning of the end" of their journey to New
York City.

"Now, jus' as soon as we get into the light again, and under
a big high roof, and the cars stop, that will be New York! Oh,
Teddy Terry, aren't you glad we're almost there?"

In his excitement Teddy forgot where he was, and, jumping to
his feet, he shouted: "Whoop!" as loudly as if he had been standing
in his own garden at home. Then, with an immediate sense of his
mistake, the little boy dropped again into his seat, and covered his
mouth with both hands, while his little crimson face was a pitiful
sight to see.

"Oh, I forgot!" said he. "I truly did forget; but I did feel so
full of halloo, I       I       it came right out 'fore I guessed it would!"
He looked very penitent, but whispered to Polly:

"Don't you wish you could halloo, Polly darling? I should think
you would!"

"Teddy Terry, I'm just bursting to halloo as loud as I can, but
I s'pose we'll have to keep on wanting to and never doing it while
we're European travelers. It'll be hard holding in, Teddy; but we've
truly got to, else Mamma and Papa'll be 'shamed of our queerness
again, don't you see?"

Teddy saw, and made up his mind to crowd his "hallooing
feelings" as deeply down inside of him as possible in future; and
just then the train gave a jerk, and began to move again very slowly,
and at last New York was reached.[17]




CHAPTER IV.

ON THE VOYAGE.


IT was a very fine morning when our party of four went on board
the steamship (which we will call the Funda, though that isn't
the real name) bound for the sunny Italian town of Naples. The
water sparkled in the sunshine, and the harbor was gay with the many
kinds of ships and vessels in port. The dock was crowded with people
going away and the friends who had come down to see them off, as is
always the case. Teddy and Polly clung to Mamma's hands, while
Papa attended to the baggage, and at last they were safely on the
steamer's deck, watching the crowd below and the handkerchiefs constantly
waved from dock to deck and from deck to dock. Of course
there was a great crowd of people on the ship also who were not
going away, but were taking a look at the steamer's handsome saloons
and state-rooms, and chatting with their departing friends or relatives
until the warning cry: "All ashore!" would be heard. As Teddy and
Polly presently went with Mamma down the grand staircase from the
deck to the dining-saloon, and along the corridor to the two state-rooms
reserved for their use, they noticed with great delight the
quantities of beautiful flowers arranged on the dining-tables awaiting
the passengers to whom they had been sent by friends as a "Bon
voyage" and "send-off." (You know, perhaps, without my telling,
that "Bon voyage" means "good voyage"       "pleasant journey" in
other words.) There were a quantity of letters also waiting to be
claimed, and presently Mamma found several for herself, and oh! joy
for Teddy! one little letter addressed to him. How surprised he was!
and how Polly rejoiced with him!

"Why, how did Mamma get it here all right on this ship,
Auntie?" he asked, as Mrs. Darling opened it to read it to him.[18]

"Oh, she knew just when the ship was to sail from here, and
sent it along in the good old mail-bag, and so here it is, all full of
surprise for her boy, and full of love and kisses." Then she read it
to him, sitting       they three       in a quiet corner of the saloon, and
Teddy's brown eyes filled with loving tears, and just a little bit of
homesick longing for a sight of his dearly loved Mother's face. But
the letter made him very happy, and after "Auntie" had finished reading
he laid his soft little lips and then his cheek against it for a minute
and handed it to her again for safe keeping.

Then they went to the state-rooms       Polly was to share with
Mamma, and Teddy and Mr. Darling were to have the room connecting       and
Mamma put everything in order for the voyage, and
then they went back to the deck to watch the preparations for casting
off from the dock. The trunks were rapidly being lowered into the
hold, and Teddy screamed with pleasure and excitement when he
chanced to see his little trunk borne along on the shoulders of a big
sailor who handled it as though it were only a feather. The letters
"T. T." stood out proudly enough on the end of the trunk, as though
they felt the great importance of belonging to a boy who was being a
"European traveler" for the first time in his life.

"And see, Teddy, see!" cried Polly, pointing eagerly to a man
following next. "There's Mamma's trunk! I see the big red 'D' on
the top. But Papa's isn't there! Oh, Teddy Terry, do you s'pose
they're forgetting 'bout Papa's trunk? Don't you think I ought to find
Papa and tell him 'bout it?"

"Hi! man!" began Teddy, in his zeal for the trunk's safety, but
Mamma caught his little arm as he was waving it about frantically
to attract the sailor's attention, and stopped further proceedings on the
spot, explaining that nothing would be forgotten, and that they surely
would find the trunk all safe and sound on arrival at Naples. Just
then Papa came along, and they moved to the rail of the deck to watch
the people obey the warning shout of "All on shore!" while the
hoarse whistle of the steamer's "blow-pipe" and the hurried orders
given by the ship's officers made a sort of confusion which was intensely
interesting to our dear and wonder-struck little couple.[19]

Impulsive Teddy, after his usual fashion when overcome with
delight or deep feeling of any kind, threw his arm about Polly's neck
and repeatedly kissed her fair little cheek, nor cared how many
strangers were looking on. Indeed, I don't believe he even gave them
a thought, as he was entirely absorbed in his joy, and his Polly; and
as for Polly herself, she was so used to being kissed and loved by her
little comrade that the presence of strangers did not trouble her at all,
and she calmly kissed Teddy back again, greatly to the amusement of
her Father and Mother, as also of some people standing near, who
asked Mrs. Darling if the children were twins. Mamma laughingly
explained about them, and told of their devotion to each other, and
how Teddy happened to be with them on the trip.





"Well," said one of the group, "I certainly think they are the dearest
little couple I ever met." And Mamma smiled when she heard the
usual title again given to her young charges. So you will readily believe
me when I tell you that it wasn't long before Teddy and Polly[20]
were prime favorites on
board with all with
whom they came in
contact.





But we must return
to our little ones,
who, you know, were
watching the dock and
the preparations for the
start. They didn't
know anybody on the
dock, but wished all the
same to do as much
handkerchief-waving as
anybody else, so they
went at it heart and
soul; and, though the breezes didn't play tricks on any of the
"grown-ups," yet they certainly did with Polly and Teddy, for presently
there were two small handkerchiefs floating in the air, and far
beyond the reach of the surprised little owners, whose eyes were following
their property hopelessly enough.

But the little couple didn't care. "Let's play they're little white
birds," laughed Polly, secretly wishing they had some more to float
off. You see, they were too happy to mind any sort of mishap not
serious. The little handkerchiefs floated farther on, and finally landed
around the corner of the dock. While the children were pulling
Mamma's gown to call her attention to it, and tell her about the mishap,
there came a last shout of "Good-bye! good-bye!" from those on
deck and on shore, and the gang planks were hauled in, and with a
slow, very gentle movement, as the mooring-ropes were cast off and
pulled on board, the big steamship moved away from the pier, and the
distance gradually widened between her stern and the watchers on the
dock, who were still waving hats, handkerchiefs, and canes with handkerchiefs
fastened to their heads, so that the farewell signals might
reach as high and as far as possible.[21]




CHAPTER V.

ON THE VOYAGE.


THE morning slipped away rapidly, and by the time the bugle
blew its summons for luncheon the little couple had explored the
steamer, under Papa's guidance, pretty thoroughly. You know
children like to explore, and go scampering about to see all that can
be seen, in a new place and amid strange surroundings, and Polly and
Teddy made no exception to the rule, you may be sure. They had
looked wonderingly down from the first-cabin deck upon the steerage
deck, and had taken note of the funny and the too often sad scenes
to be found in the steerage of a ship. It was all very interesting and
very wonderful to see the emigrants of different nationalities all gathered
on the deck: some stretched out in the sun, some eating out of
dishes which Polly and Teddy thought looked "very dirty and horrid";
some resting their tired heads on their hands, supporting their
elbows on their knees; crowds of little bits of children, babies, and
untidy-looking men and women, mingling with others who were far
more respectable in appearance, but too poor to be able to pay more
than the low steerage fare. Our children took everything in with their
bright, attentive eyes, and felt very sorry for those poor passengers below
their own clean, comfortable deck. They had made friends with
several of the sailors, and the "little sailor" (the captain's boy), and had
been stopped by so many of the passengers who wanted to have a chat
with the dear little couple that they felt quite well acquainted with
everybody. They had       after the easy fashion of all little people       scraped
acquaintance with the few other children on board, and had[22]
finally gotten tired of racing about, and were really quite as hungry
as little bears when luncheon was ready.

The luncheon in the beautiful flower-decked dining-saloon was,
I will add, another most interesting event for them; and though they
felt a little shy at first, and afraid of the attentive stewards, and of so
many strangers at a time all about them, yet I can assure you they behaved
like a little prince and princess, and nobody even guessed how shy
they were (though everybody near them did notice, I will say just
here, what cultivated little table manners "that dear little couple"
possessed).

Well, it was some time since luncheon was done with, and while
Papa and Mamma were lolling back in their steamer chairs reading,
Teddy and Polly were standing close by, looking over the rail. The
wind had arisen greatly during the afternoon, and big rolling waves
were chasing each other over the water, making "soap-suds" white and
foamy as Bridget and Ann at home used to make on washing-days.

Teddy wore a little velvet traveling-cap, black, of course, to
match his velvet knickerbockers and the little jacket he wore over his
white frilled shirt with its broad white collar. Just now the wind had
blown his cap almost off his head (fortunately it couldn't blow it out
to sea, for wise Mamma had secured it with a cord to a buttonhole in
his jacket), and it was tilted a little on one side of his brown,
soft curls, and was giving his pretty face a very roguish expression.
Polly was wearing a dainty grey dress and little jacket, and a grey
"Tam o' Shanter" cap upon her sunny head. The wind had a fine time
blowing her long wavy hair about her shoulders, but her cap was as
safely secured as Ted's, so they didn't mind the pranks of the wind,
which seemed to blow harder every minute.

Although Teddy's face looked, as I have said, quite roguish, and
although Polly was chattering away, seemingly as merrily as possible,
yet neither of them felt very roguish or merry, and pretty soon Teddy
said, in a sort of subdued tone: "I       I don't really think decks are nice
as gardens, do you, Polly?"



      Polly and Teddy made friends with the captain     s
little boy.      


"Why, Teddy Terry!" was the surprised reply, "you said your
[24]own self, jus' a teenty time ago, that you liked decks lots better'n our
gardens!"

"Well, gar       gardens don't make you feel so       so sort of queer
right here!" said Ted, laying his chubby hand on his chest. "Don't
you feel something funny inside?"

"Well, I don't feel real good, Teddy, but       let's       oh, let's       I must
go and ask Mamma what makes me feel so queer." And suddenly
turning from the rail, the little girl, who had never before had such
strange sensations, staggered over to her mother's side, and with pale
face begged to go and lie down.

Teddy followed her, equally white and fearful, and Mamma and
Papa at once led them down the stairs to the state-rooms.

"Poor little tots!" said Papa; "you're only having your first experience
of sea-sickness! It won't last long."

Teddy and Polly didn't care how long or how short things might
last, if only they could just that minute feel better. But the "funny
feeling" relieved itself in the usual way very soon, and our little
couple were put into their berths and comforted and petted until they
fell asleep, and as they slept poor Papa and Mamma had their little
turn at the same kind of discomfort, and, when they were relieved,
followed the children's example and took a long nap. They didn't care
for dinner that night, either of the party, and in fact very few of the
passengers went to the dining-saloon, for the steamer was having such
a wild frolic and dance on the waves that things were hardly comfortable
on deck or in the saloons, and the stewardesses and stewards were
very busy all night, and for all the next day, because the gale lasted so
long and made so much seasickness on board that nobody felt very
happy, you see.[25]











CHAPTER VI.

NAPLES IS CLOSE AT HAND.


THE discomforts of the voyage, however, were very few; and after
the strong winds died away, and the sky got rid of the wind
clouds, and brought forth its merry sunshine again, the passengers
crowded the decks, and took their ease in their comfortable
steamer chairs, reading, writing, or just being lazy awhile, and the
children played the game of "shuffle-board," and "tag," and "hide-and-seek,"
and such games as little people when they get together
whether on land or shipboard, enjoy with all their might and main.
Polly and Teddy laughed as loud and as often as the rest of the
children, and bumped with the "grown-ups" during "tag" quite as frequently,
but they always said: "Excuse me!" when they did so, and if it
was a lady they ran against Teddy's cap was off in an instant while he
made his little polite apology. I regret to say the other little ones
were apt to forget that small act of politeness; they were so fearful of
being "tagged," perhaps they hadn't time for apologies for unintentional
rudeness. But after awhile, in some way, they caught the trick[26]
from Polly and Teddy, and surely that was a good thing, wasn't it?
(I only mention this to show you that even little people       no matter
how little they are       can influence each other for good or bad, and it
is so much better to choose the "good," you know).

And now I come to the day       or rather the early morning of the
day       when the good ship steamed into the beautiful Bay of Naples
with her colors flying, her band playing, and a crowd of excited
and early risers amongst the passengers at the deck railings. Amongst
them, of course, were our little couple and Mamma and Papa, and the
children were wild with delight over the novelty of the scenes before
them: the swarms of small native boats, which hung around under the
steamship's sides, at her bow, and under her stern; the natives themselves,
calling out in their whining tones for "Monie, monie!"
(money); the little Italian lads who were constantly diving for the
pennies some of the laughing passengers were tossing into the water.

You would not believe they could possibly have found those
pennies (they were not "pennies" as we call our coppers, but small
coin of not even the value of one of our pennies, and which were
called "centesimi") in the water; but then you must know the water
in the Bay of Naples is very blue       oh! a beautiful blue       and very
transparent, and those small imps of divers would dart head-first down
below the surface, and catch the coin in their teeth, and come up
laughing, ready for more.

Our children had, during the voyage, seen porpoises jumping out
of the water, and had seen the signalling of the few passing ships, and
had thought those sights great fun. Think, then, how "all-overish
with gladness" they felt here in Naples harbor, watching these foreign
scenes, and so happy with the novelty of their position that they fairly
longed to open their rosy mouths and whoop after their usual fashion
at home.

They looked ahead of them and saw the pretty city of Naples
gleaming in the shine of the early rising sun, with its terraced gardens
rising one above the other in masses of green foliage, through
which the gaily-colored roofs of houses and other buildings could be
seen. It made a charming and picturesque sight for everybody; and[27]
even those who had seen it all many times before, perhaps, felt the
same thrill of delight as our dear little couple were feeling as they beheld
it all for the very first time.

"It makes me feel so full in here!" said Polly, to her mother,
while her blue eyes shone like stars.





"Me, too!" echoed Master Teddy, placing his hand as Polly did,
on his heart, and drawing a long breath.

But we must hurry on with our story. (Don't blame me, children,[28]
for hurrying, and leaving out much you would like to know, but blame
the Publishers, for it is all their fault, I'll tell you privately.) When,
at last, our party found themselves on the dock, and were waiting for
Papa to finish attending to the baggage, Polly saw something which
made her cry out: "Oh! look!" It was a little bower all decorated with
large yellow lemons, larger than any lemons the children had ever
seen before. The bower was coming straight towards them, and they
couldn't see what made it move. From the top of the little arch (the
inside of the arch, which was just like a tiny summer-house) more big
lemons were hanging, and also some little glasses, which were hanging
by handles. As the queer thing came nearer, the children discovered
that the small bower was built upon a little hand-cart, and that a brown-faced
Italian lad, no older than Teddy, was drawing it between shafts,
as though he had been a little pony. He was so nearly hidden by vines
and lemon boughs that it was no wonder he had not at first been seen
by Teddy and Polly, whose bright eyes were seeing so much. Nestling
amongst vines on the bottom of the cart was a bright tin pail, and that
was full of lemonade, which looked very clean and nice because it had
just been freshly made. The little lemonade vendor came close to our
party, and began a low, bird-like beautiful whistle. It sounded like a
flute at first, then like a bird, then like a sweet Eolian harp, and even
Mamma was delighted to hear it. After he had finished, his black
eyes twinkled, and he said in broken English which Italian children
readily pick up: "Buy limonade! ze signorina buy limonade? vera chip"
(cheap), "on'y fiva centa glass!" He filled a glass and handed it to
Polly       "ze little mees!"

"We're very fond of lemonade, Auntie Darling," said Teddy,
casting wistful eyes upon the cool drink.

"Well, you shall have some then," laughed Mamma, and Teddy
and Polly took their first refreshment on Italian shores. The little
Beppo grinned at them, pulled a ragged cap from a mass of black,
close curling hair, and, dropping his centesimi (with which Mrs. Darling
had provided herself before leaving the steamer, at the purser's
office) into his pocket, he began a merry whistle again and moved off
in search of more custom.[29]




CHAPTER VII.

THE DRIVE TO THE HOTEL.


AS the hotel to which the Darlings wished to go was located on one
of the city heights, commanding a fine view of the bay and
famous old Mount Vesuvius (about which our little couple had
been told by Papa), the drive there from the dock was of course long
enough to let them see a great many funny sights on the way, and
you may be sure they were greatly impressed by them all.

They saw men and women in queer costumes of gay colors       the
women without hats or bonnets       going about the streets, and sunning
themselves in the doorways, combing their children's heads or their own
untidy locks; they saw them hanging out their washing on the backs of
chairs right out in the street; they saw a woman and a cow together
pulling a big wagon; they saw a wee bit of a donkey harnessed with
an ox, and both tugging at a cart as placidly as though they weren't a
funny pair; they saw a cow, a horse, and a donkey, all three harnessed
before a vegetable-cart, on which sat a driver "not even as old as
Teddy," the children were sure, though he may have been older than
he looked, as so many of the poorer class of children in Naples are
stunted in growth; they saw a wee little bony donkey pulling a wagon
which carried six big men and women in it, and they didn't think it was
a bit cruel to put so heavy a burden on such a little beast. But our dear
little tender-hearted couple thought it so cruel that they could not even
look at it after the first glance.

They saw lots of little children in the street going about with
great beautiful bunches of flowers       red, red roses and Italian violets[30]
in their dirty little hands, running after carriages, and holding their
fragrant wares up to the ladies and gentlemen who were driving about
to see the city. Polly wondered why the people didn't want to keep
the flowers, but kept shaking their heads no all the time. She knew
she would keep them and say: "Thank you," very politely if any little
girl or boy offered her any.

And presently a small boy ran up to the carriage and held up his
roses. Now, it chanced that Mamma and Papa were very busy at that
moment searching for certain information in their guide-books, and so
they did not notice the little flower-boy, nor hear Miss Polly's delighted
thanks as she took the flowers in her eager hands. The carriage was
going very slowly, and the expectant little Italian trotted alongside
waiting for the coin which in her dear innocent heart Polly had no
idea was wanted, for she was whispering to Teddy: "I think these
Napelers are very kind and polite to us, don't you?" And she gravely
proceed to divide her gift with her "chum."

"Una lira! una lira!" whined the impatient lad outside, and
at that Mamma looked up and discovered Polly's funny mistake.
How she laughed, and Papa too! How red Polly's cheeks grew!
Redder than her roses, which she thought had been a polite gift to her.

"What does he mean?" Teddy asked, "saying all the time 'ooner-leerer'?"

"He means that he wants one lira (which means twenty cents of
our money) for his roses," replied Mamma, "and I will let you give him
the money, dear," passing it to Teddy, who felt very much like a
grown-up man as he leaned over and dropped the price of Polly's beautiful
roses in the outstretched and very dirty little hand of the Italian.

"I don't think Napelers are so polite and kind as I did," said
Polly somewhat crossly, for, you see, she felt so astonished and so
ashamed of her mistake that it did make her a little cross with herself
and the circumstances.



      A small boy ran up to the carriage, and held
up his roses.      


However, when Teddy sweetly and with great gallantry pinned
one of his share of the roses to Polly's jacket, she smiled her crossness
out of sight, and everything was cheerful again. As they drove
along the children saw many other curious things, and stored them
away in their memories to talk over together and tell to their little[32]
friends at home. Finally they arrived at the hotel, and were shown to
their rooms, which overlooked the bay.

Old Vesuvius, which had been through a state of fierce eruption
(you all know about volcanos, of course, and must have heard about
Mount Vesuvius, so that you will know what a volcanic eruption
means, and I need not explain it here) some time before this, was now
settling down into quite a calm state again, but that night after the sky
had grown dark our little couple noticed the dull red glow on the crater's
head, and saw little thin streaks of fire down upon the side of the
mountain nearest the bay; and Papa told them all about the famous old
mountain and its bad habits, and promised to take them to the ruins of
the once beautiful and ancient city of Pompeii (I shouldn't wonder if my
little readers had studied about it in their geographies), and tell
them of the way old Vesuvius went to work, long, long, long ago to destroy
the city and its inhabitants by throwing lava and hot ashes down
upon it, on a day when everybody was happy, and careless, and little
dreaming what was coming to them all.

After looking out upon the shining waters of the bay, and seeing
the pretty reflection of the stars in them by-and-by, and listening to the
twinkling music of mandolins and the tuneful voices of the Italian
street-singers awhile, our little Teddy and Polly went sleepily to bed,
and never even had a dream, their slumber was so sound.[33]




CHAPTER VIII.

AN EXCURSION.


MANY a nice walk about the streets of Naples did our dear happy
little couple take with Mamma and Papa, and into many a
shop did they go, completely fascinated with the pretty goods
displayed there. They longed to buy up everything they saw, and, if
they had been allowed a larger portion of coin than Papa good-naturedly
gave them each day, I don't know how many wonderful things they
would have purchased.

They enjoyed the street scenes, too, as they walked along. The
long-eared donkeys, which carried on either side of their short round
backs such enormous and heavily loaded paniers that sometimes all you
could see of the little animals were their slender legs, their long wagging
ears, and their tails. But they didn't seem to mind their burdens
at all, and plodded along thinking their own donkey thoughts, and no
doubt wondering what Teddy and Polly were laughing at them for!
And then there were the little shops where fruits were sold, and over
the doorways of which were hanging great branches full of oranges and
lemons, just as the boughs were broken from the trees (as we in our
country, you know, like to break a bough hanging full of cherries from
our cherry-trees).

It was wonderful to Polly and Teddy to see such a sight, and
to see, as they had seen at their meals in the hotel, those large oval
lemons and the golden round oranges served to the hotel guests on the
stems, with the clustering leaves adorning them. (You don't see such
things as those in New York, do you?)

Well, and then there were the beautiful gardens, rising one above[34]
the other in a bewildering mass of foliage of orange, lemon, and olive
trees rich in fruit. Those gardens belonged to the wealthy class of
Neapolitans, and their pretty dwelling-houses stood amongst the gardens
on their terraces, overlooking the city like sentinels on the hills.

There were queer streets       side streets they were       which consisted
only of a series of stone steps running straight up hill, like steps
dug out of a steep cliff-side; and along the sides of those "step-streets,"
as Teddy called them, were little bits of houses and shops scooped out of
the walls of the terraces and made comfortable, after a fashion, for
those who lived in them, and who kept their tiny stores.

Polly and Teddy looked up at them as they passed, and noticed
that the stone steps       from top to bottom       were swarming with children,
men, and women, and nearly all of them, even the wee little
people, carried baskets and various burdens as easily on their heads as
in their hands; and the strange part was that some of those bundles,
which were poised so safely on the heads, would have made a fair load
for a horse, so large were they.

Another funny thing the little couple were greatly interested in
was the sight of those peculiar decorations each horse, donkey, and
cow, and even the oxen were wearing when in harness. It consisted
of a long feather, as though from a rooster's tail, which was stuck
securely over the animal's forehead, and waved and waggled to and
fro as the animal walked along.

When there was no feather to be seen, there was always a tuft
of hair or a tuft of fur fastened in place either between the animal's ears
or on the harness, and it was considered a very wrong thing if either
of those peculiar decorations was forgotten when harnessing.

Why? Well, because, unfortunately, the lower classes of Italians
have many foolish superstitions, and that is one of them, for they
fancy that "ill luck" is kept off and the "evil eye" of misfortune
turned aside by the use of the feathers, the hair, or the fur in the manner
I have described.

Polly and Teddy agreed that it was a very silly idea, and I'm afraid
they didn't have much respect for the drivers of the animals they saw
decorated in that absurd style.[35]

One day Papa and Mamma took the children to the island of
Capri. They had seen the island from their windows rising out of the
bay in the distance, and the guide-book told them that it would be a
fine excursion on a fair day. So they started off one lovely morning
in the little excursion boat that takes passengers to and fro between
Naples and the island of Capri and other points of interest in the bay.





I cannot take time to give all the particulars of the boat trip and
its delights, but must tell you about the famous "Blue Grotto," which
they reached before arriving at Capri.

The "Blue Grotto" is a cave in the rocks of one of the cliffs, and[36]
when the water is smooth a row-boat can be paddled through the low
opening which makes the mouth of the cave; but in rough weather no
boat can make the passage, as the opening is so very small.

The rock on one side of the cave does not go to the bottom, but
is only sunken a little way below the water. So the sunlight strikes
down under the rock, as well as under the entrance hole, and is reflected
upwards again through the water in the cave, which causes a wonderful
silvery light, and a beautiful pale blue tint to the water and the roof of
the cave.

Visitors to Capri always stop at the "Blue Grotto" on the way,
and when the big boat       the excursion boat       stops at that part of the
cliff there are a crowd of men in little row-boats, waiting to take passengers
who wish to go into the cave and show them the wonders of it,
for a small coin each passenger. So of course our little couple must see
it, and so must Mamma. Papa, who had seen it all once before (when
he and Mamma had taken a trip alone, before Polly could remember),
did not go, for the boatman would only carry three passengers on the
trip.

You may imagine how they enjoyed it, and when they saw a boatman
from another boat jump over into the water and splash about to
show his passengers how like a silver blue water-sprite he could look
the children gave one of their delighted whoops right there, and then
nearly fell out of their own boat with fright at the loud strange echo
the cave gave back at their shout.

Well, after the passengers returned from the cave, the steamboat
went on its way, and in due time the landing at Capri was made, and
the passengers were told that they would have two hours of time in
which to see everything of interest on the beautiful island, before the
boat should start on to Sorrento (which is another charming resort not
far from Capri).

Such a crowd of donkey boys and donkey girls as were on the dock
when the steamboat stopped! They were all yelling at one time, trying
to coax passengers to use their donkeys or their cabs, and pay them
so much per hour.



      The Blue Grotto of Capri.      


Now, you see, Capri is a funny sort of island, for it is "taller than[38]
it is broad," as people say. It rises right out of the bay in a lot of terraced
cliffs, and as far up as you can see it is just a mass of green gardens
and woods.

At the base of the island are the village streets, and odd little
houses, and shops and hotels, and at one of the hotels our party of
four ate a good dinner, before taking a carriage up the mountain road
to Anacapri, a funny little bit of a village right at the very top of the
island.

When the dinner was finished Mamma and Papa took the back
seat in the open little "victoria" (as the carriage was called, though
it was very small and crampy in its proportions), and the little couple,
gay as larks, and wide-eyed with wonder, sat close together on the
small footstool of a seat in front of the "grown-ups," and with a
crack of the whip (which the horse didn't even jump at, because he is
so used to it, and best of all, because the "crack" is only in the air and
not against his bony sides) they all started off for "Anacapri."

I could tell you of a great many things they saw on the way, and
of the natives they passed, who bobbed and curtsied to the travelers,
and showed their white teeth, and held up their little brown babies, hoping
for the gift of a coin or two. And I would like to describe the
magnificent sight of the olive-gardens, and of the trees hanging full of
lemons and oranges, and of the beautiful flowering vines which grew
by the roadside, and the shade trees, and particularly of the grand sight
which greeted their eyes with every turn of the winding road which
brought the Bay of Naples (stretching itself far and wide and dotted
all over with odd little ships and boats) into view. But I must skip all
those things, and get you at last with the dear little couple to the mite of
a village mentioned as "Anacapri."

From there our friends looked right down upon the bay and over
at Naples, and if they had been little birds they would have spread
their wings and taken a good fly into the blue sunny space before them       at
least, that is what Teddy whispered in Polly's ear he would like
to do.[39]




CHAPTER IX.

WHAT THEY SAW AT ANACAPRI, AND HOW THEY WENT ON TO SORRENTO
AND POMPEII.






WHEN the carriage stopped in the midst of the small houses at
Anacapri, instantly a swarm of little boys and girls surrounded
it. While the horse was resting, the small natives
stared at our friends, and gazed especially hard and long upon Polly
and Teddy, who felt quite shy and uncomfortable over the matter.
They finally decided to give a few stares back again, and little bashful
Polly ventured to smile, though she didn't have anything in particular
to smile about. Teddy, seeing Polly smile, thought he ought to, and in a
few moments every little Italian face was on the broad grin also.
Mamma and Papa had been talking with the driver, who could speak a
little broken English, but they were ready to notice the pretty brown
faces of the children who stood beside the carriage, and now decided
that Anacapri could boast of the good looks of its "small fry" with
good reason. There was only one ugly-featured little boy in the
crowd, and he was very ugly indeed, and not only that, but his hair was
red, and his eyes very blue, and he was so fair of skin that his face
was covered with freckles. He spoke Italian, however, like a native,
and Papa wondered what sort of little red-haired native he might be.
So he spoke to him in English, to see if the boy would comprehend.
To his surprise he answered with a merry smile, and then, another
surprise, a little fellow beside him spoke up also in English, and explained
that, though he was dark in complexion, and Italian all over,
yet he was brother to the red-haired boy, who was Scotch; and that
Jim's father was a Scotchman, and when he died his mother married an
Italian whom she met in England, and when he died she was left poor,[40]
and through some friends
in Anacapri had come there
to live only seven months
before. He told all this in
good, though of course
childish and broken English,
for he was only nine years
old. Then Jim, the little
Scotchman, put in his word,
and when asked how they
happened       in only a few
months       to speak Italian
like natives, when they had
lived in other countries all
their lives before, he replied,
tossing his head proudly:
"Oh, that ain't anythin'. We
got it off the boys here!"
Of course all this was deeply
interesting to Polly and
Teddy, and they took a great
fancy to the little brothers.
But presently a boy who had
not spoken before, not knowing
English, put his hand inside
his shirt and pulled out
a little brown bird. Holding
it by both wee feet, he held
it up, while its poor little
heart was beating and its tiny
wings fluttering with fear.
"Monie!" he said, and it
was the only English word
he cared to know       "monie!"
and he pointed to the bird[41]
and then to the sky. The little couple looked wonderingly at him, and
the Scotch boy explained that if Polly gave the boy a coin he would
let the poor birdie fly away in safety. If he didn't get the coin, then
he would take it home and his family would cook it for supper.

That made our little couple indignant, and vexed also the Mamma
and kind-hearted Papa. So he paid over a coin, and up, up, up into the
sunny space above flew little birdie, and the children       our children       shouted
with pleasure to see the poor captive free. But       what do
you think came next? Why, that cruel boy put his hand inside his
shirt again, and out came another bird, and with it the same request
for "monie." Of course, he was frowned upon, and not another coin
was given him, for Papa found he had a "bunch of birds" hidden there
to earn their freedom by coin-giving, at every chance offered, and as
those same birds, after being freed, would be caught again in time,
the outlook was discouraging, wasn't it?

And now, the horse being rested, the party turned about to go
back to the steamboat landing below, and to the small Scotchie and
his Italian brother only did Mr. Darling give a farewell gift of coin,
as they drove away and finally left the little village behind them.

When they reached Sorrento a little while after, it was late in
the afternoon, and Papa said they must spend the night there and
go on by carriage to see the ruins of Pompeii the next day.

It was a delightful experience to our little European travelers
when they saw that the steamboat did not go close up beside the
landing dock, as at Capri, but that the passengers were to be taken
off in small boats and rowed ashore. They could hardly wait their
turn for it, but finally the blissful moment arrived, and the children
were seated in the stern of the little boat, gliding over the blue waters.
Oh! you have no idea how very blue and clear the water there really
is. It is like beautiful azure blue ribbon, satin ribbon, and you feel as
if you'd like to carry home bottles of it. But as it is the sunshine and
the condition of the depths of water and bottom of the bay all combined
which produce that color there       you would not be able to bottle
it, would you?

Well, when the landing was reached, the children had to lift their[42]
eyes to a height on top of a steep cliff wall before they could see the
hotel in which the night was to be spent.

"I never in the world, Teddy Terry, can climb up there!" said
puzzled little Polly. But Ted thought it would be real fun to climb
it, and was quite disappointed when Papa pointed to a narrow railroad
which ran up, up, up the cliff through a tunnel beginning not far from
where they had left the boat. "It is called a 'funicular,' or, as the
Italians call it, a 'funicolare,'" explained Papa, "and the little car we
are to enter presently is drawn up to the top of the cliff by a cable, a
strong wire rope, very thick and quite able to do its work safely, so you
needn't look so frightened, little goosey," to Polly, for her eyes were
full of anxious wonderment, and she took tight hold of her Father's
hand.

"I'm not a bit frightened," declared Teddy, but I really think he
was a tiny bit afraid, for he grasped the tail of Papa's coat pretty
closely as they followed Mamma into the little car, which seemed to be
standing almost on end, and looked as though at any moment it might
roll backwards down the incline. However, they arrived in good condition
at the top before long, and were able to rest themselves and by-and-by
eat a good dinner in the fine hotel, which was located in the
midst of a wonderful garden right there on top of the cliff. Next morning
they visited the little shops where beautiful olive-wood articles were
sold, and Papa bought a fine ruler for Ted, and a dainty little clothes-brush
(both of carved olive-wood) for Polly.

Then it was time to drive to Pompeii, and after a long, rather
dusty drive down the mountain road, they found themselves amongst
the ruins of that ancient city at last. Of course such little folks as
Polly and Teddy couldn't take quite as much interest in the old city as
grown-up visitors were taking, but they were quick to observe everything
especially interesting: the ruts in the paved streets worn deeply
by the wheels of the chariots used in those days (something like the
chariots you have seen, no doubt, when Barnum's big circus comes
along, and all little folks go to see it, of course); the big flat stepping-stones
in the streets, which were placed there so that people could have
a clean, dry, and raised crossing from one side to the other (very nice[43]
for rainy, muddy weather, wasn't it?); the bake ovens where loaves
of bread were baking at the very moment the flood of hot cinders and
lava came thickly down upon the city and destroyed it so suddenly and
so soon; the old drinking-fountains still bearing the worn impressions
and dents made by the hands which used to rest upon the fountain basins
so long ago. Papa explained that according to history the city
was seven hundred years old when destroyed, and it lay over a thousand
years under twenty feet of ashes. You see, the ashes cooled, and
the lava hardened, and there was no sign of any city there till all those
many years had passed, and then by accident, history tells us, it was discovered
that there was a city away down under all that earth (grass
had grown over it in all that long time, and it looked like meadows).
Then people set to work digging, and lo and behold! uncovered so much
of it that everybody flocked to see it. So that is how Polly and Teddy
at last got there, and people are still digging away, clearing more and
more of the big city from the earth over it.

Papa made it all very interesting to our little couple (and when
they got home what did Teddy do but bury away down deep in his
garden, in the deepest hole he could dig with his little spade, a whole
toy village of Polly's, and cover it up, and pound the earth and grass
over it again, and by-and-by play he was "discovering Pompeii" and
set to work to excavate the little city again).[44]




CHAPTER X.

BACK TO NAPLES, AND "HOMEWARD BOUND."


WELL, after they had seen Pompeii, and looked at the curiosities
in the little museum of the office and station building
near by, our little couple felt very tired, and begged Papa
to take them home.

Polly's little golden head ached, and Teddy's stocking had gotten
into a wrinkle on his heel, and it hurt him to walk, and they both
agreed that they didn't care one bit if "Vesulivus" did cover old
"Pompawy" all over with ashes and dirt. They wanted to go home
and rest Polly's head and Teddy's lame heel, and so Papa and Mamma
confessed to being pretty tired also, and soon they were in the train,
speeding rapidly towards Naples, having had two days of "round trip
excursion," and a "jolly good time," as the children expressed it.

I would like to tell you about all the little couple did and all they
saw while there for four happy weeks, but I must leave it all to your
lively imagination, dear little readers, and whatever beautiful times
you imagine for the children you may be sure they had.



      I have almost kept my promise to my
Mamma and tried to be a good boy.      


Papa was obliged to return to his business at home after a month
of good times abroad, and so the day came when the trunks were
packed again, and the clock was being watched, and the hotel "bus"
being listened for, etc., and our little couple again in haste to go on
board the steamship, for, much as they had enjoyed themselves, they
confided secretly to each other the grand truth that       "After all, they
liked their own gardens and playtimes at home lots better'n European
things, and that Bridgie and Ann made things taste nicer to eat than
the queer cooks in Naples; and 'sides all that, they hadn't seen any tree
[46]at all that was half so nice as their own apple-tree where they could
sit in amongst the leaves together, and       and       they guessed 'Merican
things were nicer for little boys and girls, any way!"

Teddy had put into a snug corner of his small trunk a few little
gifts for "dear own Mamma and Papa," and a nice present for his
Bridget and Polly's Ann.

And Polly had carefully stowed away in Mamma's trunk also
some pretty gifts for "Auntie Terry and Uncle Terry," and a present
each for her Ann and Teddy's Bridgie; and the things they planned
to do and the good times they planned to have when once more at
their own pretty cottage homes, where the old apple-tree and the
much-loved gap in the fence near it were waiting for them I can't begin
to tell you.

We see them now       as they stand together with Teddy's loving arm
about Polly, and her soft cheek pressed close to his       at the railing in
the stern of the ocean liner, taking a farewell look at sunny Naples and
Italian shores, and waving handkerchiefs to the men, women, and children
in the small row-boats which were skipping about in the bay in
the wake of the steamship, while shrill Italian voices were shouting:
"Addio! addio!"

"We've had the beautifullest time that ever could be, and we've
liked being European travelers ever so much, haven't we, Teddy
Terry?" remarked Polly at last, as the children followed Mr. Darling
to their steamer chairs; "and I must say," she added quite proudly,
"that I think we've been such good children that some day maybe
Papa'll take us to some other places. Won't that be fun?"

Teddy thought it would, but he could not be so conscientiously
sure of having been as "good" as Polly fancied, for he had a distinct
remembrance of certain occasions (of which I haven't had the heart to
tell my little readers) when Mamma Darling had had to scold pretty
severely, and he had been more humiliated about it than Polly, on
account of his promise to his own Mamma. Thinking it all over now,
as he sat in his chair beside Mrs. Darling on deck, he suddenly drew her
head down to him and earnestly whispered: "Say, Auntie, I have
almost kept my promise to my Mamma and tried to be a good boy,[47]
haven't I? You see, I wouldn't like her to say I broke my word after
she'd been and trusted me, you know, Auntie!"

Mrs. Darling put a tender kiss on the soft little tanned forehead,
and whispered back: "I'm going to tell Mamma Terry that her boy was
the best-behaved little traveler I ever saw, so cheer up, Teddy boy!"

It was a very happy little laddie who settled back in that big
steamer chair and slipped his hand into Polly's after "Auntie" had
made her whispered speech.

And now we must say good-bye to them, as the steamship speeds
on towards America's shores, and I hope this story of more of the
doings of our dear little couple will have given as much pleasure as
your first account of them. The world is full of "Dear Little Couples,"
isn't it?

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
