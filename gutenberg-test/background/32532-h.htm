<p>
King Cole was King before the troubles came,<br />
The land was happy while he held the helm,<br />
The valley-land from Condicote to Thame,<br />
Watered by Thames and green with many an elm.<br />
For many a year he governed well his realm,<br />
So well-beloved, that, when at last he died,<br />
It was bereavement to the countryside.<br />
<br />
So good, so well-beloved, had he been<br />
In life, that when he reached the judging-place<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>(There where the scales are even, the sword keen),<br />
The Acquitting Judges granted him a grace,<br />
Aught he might choose, red, black, from king to ace,<br />
Beneath the bright arch of the heaven's span;<br />
He chose, to wander earth, the friend of man.<br />
<br />
So, since that time, he wanders shore and shire,<br />
An old, poor, wandering man, with glittering eyes<br />
Helping distressful folk to their desire<br />
By power of spirit that within him lies.<br />
Gentle he is, and quiet, and most wise,<br />
He wears a ragged grey, he sings sweet words,<br />
And where he walks there flutter little birds.<br />
<br />
And when the planets glow as dusk begins<br />
He pipes a wooden flute to music old.<br />
Men hear him on the downs, in lonely inns,<br />
In valley woods, or up the Chiltern wold;<br />
His piping feeds the starved and warms the cold,<br />
It gives the beaten courage; to the lost<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>It brings back faith, that lodestar of the ghost.<br />
<br />
And most he haunts the beech-tree-pasturing chalk,<br />
The Downs and Chilterns with the Thames between.<br />
There still the Berkshire shepherds see him walk,<br />
Searching the unhelped woe with instinct keen,<br />
His old hat stuck with never-withering green,<br />
His flute in poke, and little singings sweet<br />
Coming from birds that flutter at his feet.<br />
<br />
Not long ago a circus wandered there,<br />
Where good King Cole most haunts the public way,<br />
Coming from Reading for St. Giles's Fair<br />
Through rain unceasing since Augustine's Day;<br />
The horses spent, the waggons splashed with clay,<br />
The men with heads bowed to the wester roaring,<br />
Heaving the van-wheels up the hill at Goring.<br />
<br />
Wearily plodding up the hill they went,<br />
Broken by bitter weather and the luck,<br />
Six vans, and one long waggon with the tent,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>And piebald horses following in the muck,<br />
Dragging their tired hooves out with a suck,<br />
And heaving on, like some defeated tribe<br />
Bound for Despair with Death upon their kibe.<br />
<br />
All through the morn the circus floundered thus,<br />
The nooning found them at the Crossing Roads,<br />
Stopped by an axle splitting in its truss.<br />
The horses drooped and stared before their loads.<br />
Dark with the wet they were, and cold as toads.<br />
The men were busy with the foundered van,<br />
The showman stood apart, a beaten man.<br />
<br />
He did not heed the dripping of the rain,<br />
Nor the wood's roaring, nor the blotted hill,<br />
He stood apart and bit upon his pain,<br />
Biting the bitter meal with bitter will.<br />
Focussed upon himself, he stood, stock still,<br />
Staring unseeing, while his mind repeated,<br />
"This is the end; I'm ruined; I'm defeated."<br />
<br />
From time to time a haggard woman's face<br />
Peered at him from a van, and then withdrew;<br />

<p>
Seeds from the hayrack blew about the place,<br />
The smoke out of the waggon chimneys blew,<br />
From wicker creel the skinny cockerel crew.<br />
The men who set the floundered axle straight<br />
Glanced at their chief, and each man nudged his mate.<br />
<br />
And one, the second clown, a snub-nosed youth,<br />
Fair-haired, with broken teeth, discoloured black,<br />
Muttered, "He looks a treat, and that's the truth.<br />
I've had enough: I've given him the sack."<br />
He took his wrench, arose, and stretched his back,<br />
Swore at a piebald pony trying to bite,<br />
And rolled a cigarette and begged a light.<br />
<br />
Within, the second's wife, who leaped the hoops,<br />
Nursed sour twins, her son and jealousy,<br />
Thinking of love, in luckier, happier troupes<br />
Known on the roads in summers now gone by<br />
Before her husband had a roving eye,<br />
Before the rat-eyed baggage with red hair<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>Came to do tight rope and make trouble there.<br />
<br />
Beside the vans, the clown, old Circus John,<br />
Growled to the juggler as he sucked his briar,<br />
"How all the marrow of a show was gone<br />
Since women came, to sing and walk the wire,<br />
Killing the clown his act for half his hire,<br />
Killing the circus trade: because," said he,<br />
"Horses and us are what men want to see."<br />
<br />
The juggler was a young man shaven-clean,<br />
Even in the mud his dainty way he had,<br />
Red-cheeked, with eyes like boxer's, quick and keen,<br />
A jockey-looking youth with legs besprad,<br />
Humming in baritone a ditty sad,<br />
And tapping on his teeth his finger-nails,<br />
The while the clown suckt pipe and spat his tales.<br />
<br />
Molly, the singer, watched him wearily<br />
With big black eyes that love had brimmed with tears,<br />
Her mop of short cut hair was blown awry,<br />
Her firm mouth shewed her wiser than her years.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>She stroked a piebald horse and pulled his ears,<br />
And kissed his muzzle, while her eyes betrayed<br />
This, that she loved the juggler, not the jade.<br />
<br />
And growling in a group the music stood<br />
Sucking short pipes, their backs against the rain,<br />
Plotting rebellion in a bitter mood,<br />
"A shilling more, or never play again."<br />
Their old great coats were foul with many a stain,<br />
Weather and living rough had stamped their faces,<br />
They were cast clerks, old sailors, old hard cases.<br />
<br />
Within the cowboy's van the rat-eyed wife,<br />
Her reddish hair in papers twisted close,<br />
Turned wet potatoes round against the knife,<br />
And in a bucket dropped the peelèd Oes.<br />
Her little girl was howling from her blows,<br />
The cowboy smoked and with a spanner whackt<br />
The metal target of his shooting act.<br />
<br />
And in another van more children cried<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>From being beaten or for being chid<br />
By fathers cross or mothers haggard-eyed,<br />
Made savage by the fortunes that betide.<br />
The rain dripped from the waggons: the drops glid<br />
Along the pony's flanks; the thick boots stamped<br />
The running muck for warmth, and hope was damped.<br />
<br />
Yet all of that small troupe in misery stuck,<br />
Were there by virtue of their nature's choosing<br />
To be themselves and take the season's luck,<br />
Counting the being artists worth the bruising.<br />
To be themselves, as artists, even if losing<br />
Wealth, comfort, health, in doing as they chose,<br />
Alone of all life's ways brought peace to those.<br />
<br />
So there below the forlorn woods, they grumbled,<br />
Stamping for warmth and shaking off the rain.<br />
Under the foundered van the tinkers fumbled,<br />
Fishing the splitted truss with wedge and chain.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>Soon, all was done, the van could go again,<br />
Men cracked their whips, the horses' shoulders forged<br />
Up to the collar while the mud disgorged.<br />
<br />
So with a jangling of their chains they went,<br />
Lean horses, swaying vans and creaking wheels,<br />
Bright raindrops tilting off the van roof pent<br />
And reedy cockerels crying in the creels,<br />
Smoke driving down, men's shouts and children's squeals,<br />
Whips cracking, and the hayrack sheddings blowing;<br />
The Showman stood aside to watch them going.<br />
<br />
What with the rain and misery making mad,<br />
The Showman never saw a stranger come<br />
Till there he stood, a stranger roughly clad<br />
In ragged grey of woollen spun at home.<br />
Green sprigs were in his hat, and other some<br />
Stuck in his coat; he bore a wooden flute,<br />
And redbreasts hopped and carolled at his foot.<br />
<br />
It was King Cole, who smiled and spoke to him.<br />

The Showman toppled like a broken arch.<br />
The line-squall roared upon them with loud lips.<br />
<br />
A green-lit strangeness followed, like eclipse<br />
<br />
They passed within, but, when within, King Cole<br />
Slipped from the van to head the leading team.<br />
He breathed into his flute his very soul,<br />
A noise like waters in a pebbly stream,<br />
And straight the spirits that inhabit dream<br />
Came round him, and the rain-squall roared its last<br />
And bright the wind-vane shifted as it passed.<br />
<br />
And in the rush of sun and glittering cloud<br />
That followed on the storm, he led the way,<br />
Fluting the sodden circus through the crowd<br />
That trod the city streets in holiday.<br />
And lo, a marvellous thing, the gouted clay,<br />
Splashed on the waggons and the horses, glowed,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>They shone like embers as they trod the road.<br />
<br />
And round the tired horses came the Powers<br />
That stir men's spirits, waking or asleep,<br />
To thoughts like planets and to acts like flowers,<br />
Out of the inner wisdom's beauty deep:<br />
These led the horses, and, as marshalled sheep<br />
Fronting a dog, in line, the people stared<br />
At those bright waggons led by the bright-haired.<br />
<br />
And, as they marched, the spirits sang, and all<br />
The horses crested to the tune and stept<br />
Like centaurs to a passionate festival<br />
With shining throats that mantling criniers swept.<br />
And all the hearts of all the watchers leapt<br />
To see those horses passing and to hear<br />
That song that came like blessing to the ear.<br />
<br />
And, to the crowd, the circus artists seemed<br />
Splendid, because the while that singing quired<br />
Each artist was the part that he had dreamed<br />
And glittered with the Power he desired,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>Women and men, no longer wet or tired<br />
From long despair, now shone like queens and kings,<br />
There they were crowned with their imaginings.<br />
<br />
And with them, walking by the vans, there came<br />
The wild things from the woodland and the mead,<br />
The red stag, with his tender-stepping dame,<br />
Branched, and high-tongued and ever taking heed.<br />
Nose-wrinkling rabbits nibbling at the weed,<br />
The hares that box by moonlight on the hill,<br />
The bright trout's death, the otter from the mill.<br />
<br />
There, with his mask made virtuous, came the fox,<br />
Talking of landscape while he thought of meat;<br />
Blood-loving weasels, honey-harrying brocks,<br />
Stoats, and the mice that build among the wheat,<br />
Dormice, and moles with little hands for feet,<br />
The water-rat that gnaws the yellow flag,<br />
Toads from the stone and merrows from the quag.<br />
<br />
And over them flew birds of every kind,<br />
Whose way, or song, or speed, or beauty brings<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>Delight and understanding to the mind;<br />
The bright-eyed, feathery, thready-leggéd things.<br />
There they, too, sang amid a rush of wings,<br />
With sweet, clear cries and gleams from wing and crest,<br />
Blue, scarlet, white, gold plume and speckled breast.<br />
<br />
And all the vans seemed grown with living leaves<br />
And living flowers, the best September knows,<br />
Moist poppies scarlet from the Hilcote sheaves,<br />
Green-fingered bine that runs the barley-rows,<br />
Pale candylips, and those intense blue blows<br />
That trail the porches in the autumn dusk,<br />
Tempting the noiseless moth to tongue their musk.<br />
<br />
So, tired thus, so tended, and so sung,<br />
They crossed the city through the marvelling crowd.<br />
Maids with wide eyes from upper windows hung,<br />
The children waved their toys and sang aloud.<br />
But in his van the beaten showman bowed<br />
His head upon his hands, and wept, not knowing<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>Aught of what passed except that wind was blowing.<br />
<br />
All through the town the fluting led them on,<br />
But near the western gate King Cole retired;<br />
And, as he ceased, the vans no longer shone,<br />
The bright procession dimmed like lamps expired;<br />
Again with muddy vans and horses tired,<br />
And artists cross and women out of luck,<br />
The sodden circus plodded through the muck.<br />
<br />
The crowd of following children loitered home;<br />
Maids shut the windows lest more rain should come;<br />
The circus left the streets of flowers and flags,<br />
King Cole walked with it, huddling in his rags.<br />
They reached the western gate and sought to pass.<br />
<br />
"Take back this frowsy show to where it was,"<br />
The sergeant of the gateway-sentry cried;<br />
"You know quite well you cannot pass outside."<br />

His presence seemed to change before their eyes.<br />
The old, bent, ragged, glittering, wandering fellow,<br />
With thready blood-streaks in the rided yellow<br />
Of cheek and eye, seemed changed to one who held<br />
Earth and the spirit like a king of eld.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span><br />
He spoke again: "You have been kind," said he.<br />
"In your own trouble you have thought of me.<br />
God will repay. To him who gives is given,<br />
Corn, water, wine, the world, the starry heaven."<br />
<br />
Then, like a poor old man, he took his way<br />
Back to the city, while the showman gazed<br />
After his figure like a man amazed.<br />

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 13em;">Like floating flowers</span><br />
Came butterflies, the souls of summer hours,<br />
Fluttering about the van; Red Admirals rich,<br />
Scarlet and pale on breathing speeds of pitch,<br />
Brimstones, like yellow poppy petals blown,<br />
Brown ox-eyed Peacocks in their purpled roan,<br />
Blue, silvered things that haunt the grassy chalk,<br />
Green Hairstreaks bright as green shoots on a stalk,<br />
And that dark prince, the oakwood haunting thing<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>Dyed with blue burnish like the mallard's wing.<br />
"He was a saint of God," the showman cried.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, within the town, from man to man<br />
The talk about the wondrous circus ran.<br />
All were agreed, that nothing ever known<br />
Had thrilled so tense the marrow in their bone.<br />
All were agreed, that sights so beautiful<br />
Made the Queen's court with all its soldiers dull,<br />
Made all the red-wrapped masts and papered strings<br />
Seem fruit of death, not lovely living things.<br />
And some said loudly that though time were short,<br />
Men still might hire the circus for the Court.<br />
And some, agreeing, sought the Mayor's hall,<br />
To press petition for the show's recall.<br />
<br />
But as they neared the hall, behold, there came<br />
A stranger to them dressed as though in flame;<br />
An old, thin, grinning glitterer, decked with green,<br />
With thready blood-streaks in his visage lean,<br />
And at his wrinkled eyes a look of mirth<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>Not common among men who walk the earth;<br />
Yet from his pocket poked a flute of wood,<br />
And little birds were following him for food.<br />
<br />
"Sirs," said King Cole (for it was he), "I know<br />
You seek the Mayor, but you need not so;<br />
I have this moment spoken with his grace.<br />
He grants the circus warrant to take place<br />
Within the city, should the Prince see fit<br />
To watch such pastime; here is his permit.<br />
I go this instant to the Prince to learn<br />
His wish herein: wait here till I return."<br />
<br />
They waited while the old man passed the sentry<br />
Beside the door, and vanished through the entry.<br />
They thought, "This old man shining like New Spain,<br />
Must be the Prince's lordly chamberlain.<br />
His cloth of gold so shone, it seemed to burn;<br />
Wait till he comes." They stayed for his return.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, above, the Prince stood still to bide<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>The nightly mercy of the eventide,<br />
Brought nearer by each hour that chimed and ceased.<br />
His head was weary with the city feast<br />
But newly risen from. He stood alone<br />
As heavy as the day's foundation stone.<br />
<br />
The room he stood in was an ancient hall.<br />
Portraits of long dead men were on the wall.<br />
From the dull crimson of their robes there stared<br />
Passionless eyes, long dead, that judged and glared.<br />
Above them were the oaken corbels set,<br />
Of angels reaching hands that never met,<br />
Where in the spring the swallows came to build.<br />
<br />
It was the meeting chamber of the Guild.<br />
<br />
From where he stood, the Prince could see a yard<br />
Paved with old slabs and cobbles cracked and scarred<br />
Where weeds had pushed, and tiles and broken glass<br />
Had fallen and been trodden in the grass.<br />
A gutter dripped upon it from the rain.<br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>"It puts a crown of lead upon my brain<br />
To live this life of princes," thought the Prince.<br />
"To be a king is to be like a quince,<br />
Bitter himself, yet flavour to the rest.<br />
To be a cat among the hay were best;<br />
There in the upper darkness of the loft,<br />
With green eyes bright, soft-lying, purring soft,<br />
Hearing the rain without; not forced, as I,<br />
To lay foundation stones until I die,<br />
Or sign State-papers till my hand is sick.<br />
The man who plaits straw crowns upon a rick<br />
Is happier in his crown than I the King.<br />
And yet, this day, a very marvellous thing<br />
Came by me as I walked the chamber here.<br />
Once in my childhood, in my seventh year,<br />
I saw them come, and now they have returned,<br />
Those strangers, riding upon cars that burned,<br />
Or seemed to burn, with gold, while music thrilled,<br />
Then beauty following till my heart was filled,<br />
And life seemed peopled from eternity.<br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>They brought down Beauty and Wisdom from the sky<br />
Into the streets, those strangers; I could see<br />
Beauty and wisdom looking up at me<br />
As then, in childhood, as they passed below.<br />
<br />
Men would not let me know them long ago,<br />
Those strangers bringing joy. They will not now.<br />
I am a prince with gold about my brow;<br />
Duty, not joy, is all a prince's share.<br />
<br />
And yet, those strangers from I know not where,<br />
From glittering lands, from unknown cities far<br />
Beyond the sea-plunge of the evening star,<br />
Would give me life, which princedom cannot give.<br />
They would be revelation: I should live.<br />
I may not deal with wisdom, being a king."<br />
<br />
There came a noise of someone entering;<br />
He turned his weary head to see who came.<br />
<br />
It was King Cole, arrayed as though in flame,<br />
Like a white opal, glowing from within,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>He entered there in snowy cramoisin.<br />
The Prince mistook him for a city lord,<br />
He turned to him and waited for his word.<br />
<br />
"Sir," said King Cole, "I come to bring you news.<br />
Sir, in the weary life that princes use<br />
There is scant time for any prince or king<br />
To taste delights that artists have and bring.<br />
But here, to-night, no other duty calls,<br />
And circus artists are without the walls.<br />
Will you not see them, sir?"<br />

"Ay," said the Prince, "and thankful for the chance.<br />

<p>
Then at a window looking on the street<br />
He played his flute like leaves or snowflakes falling,<br />
Till men and women, passing, thought: "How sweet;<br />
These notes are in our hearts like flowers falling."<br />
And then, they thought, "An unknown voice is calling<br />
Like April calling to the seed in earth;<br />
Madness is quickening deadness into birth."<br />
<br />
And then, as in the spring when first men hear,<br />
Beyond the black-twigged hedge, the lambling's cry<br />
Coming across the snow, a note of cheer<br />
Before the storm-cock tells that spring is nigh,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>Before the first green bramble pushes shy,<br />
And all the blood leaps at the lambling's notes,<br />
The piping brought men's hearts into their throats.<br />
<br />
Till all were stirred, however old and grand;<br />
Generals bestarred, old statesmen, courtiers prim<br />
(Whose lips kissed nothing but the Monarch's hand),<br />
Stirred in their courtly minds recesses dim,<br />
The sap of life stirred in the dreary limb.<br />
The old eyes brightened o'er the pouncet-box,<br />
Remembering loves, and brawls, and mains of cocks.<br />
<br />
And through the town the liquid piping's gladness<br />
Thrilled on its way, rejoicing all who heard,<br />
To thrust aside their dullness or their sadness<br />
And follow blithely as the fluting stirred<br />
They hurried to the guild like horses spurred.<br />
There in the road they mustered to await,<br />
They knew not what, a dream, a joy, a fate.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span><br />
And man to man in exaltation cried:<br />
"Something has come to make us young again.<br />
Wisdom has come, and Beauty, Wisdom's bride,<br />
And youth like flowering April after rain."<br />
But still the fluting piped and men were fain<br />
To sing and ring the bells, they knew not why<br />
Save that their hearts were in an ecstasy.<br />
<br />
Then to the balcony above them came<br />
King Cole the shining in his robe of flame;<br />
Behind him came the Prince, who smiled and bowed.<br />
King Cole made silence: then addressed the crowd.<br />
<br />
"Friends, fellow mortals, bearers of the ghost<br />
That burns, and breaks its lamp, but is not lost.<br />
This day, for one brief hour, a key is given<br />
To all, however poor, to enter heaven.<br />
The Bringers Down of Beauty from the stars,<br />
Have reached this city in their golden cars.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>They ask, to bring you beauty, if you will.<br />
You do not answer: rightly, you are still.<br />
But you will come, to watch the image move<br />
Of all you dreamed or had the strength to love.<br />
<br />
Come to the Ring, the image of the path<br />
That this our planet through the Heaven hath;<br />
Behold man's skill, man's wisdom, man's delight,<br />
And woman's beauty, imaged to the height.<br />
<br />
Come, for our rulers come; and Death, whose feet<br />
Tread at the door, permits a minute's sweet;<br />
To each man's soul vouchsafes a glimpse, a gleam,<br />
A touch, a breath of his intensest dream.<br />
Now, to that glimpse, that moment, come with me;<br />
Our rulers come.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">O brother let there be</span><br />
Such welcome to our Prince as never was.<br />
Let there be flowers under foot, not grass,<br />
Flowers and scented rushes and the sprays<br />
Of purple bramble reddening into blaze.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>Let there be bells rung backward till the tune<br />
Be as the joy of all the bees in June.<br />
Let float your flags, and let your lanterns rise<br />
Like fruit upon the trees in Paradise,<br />
In many-coloured lights as rich as Rome<br />
O'er road and tent; and let the children come,<br />
It is their world, these Beauty Dwellers bring."<br />
<br />
Then, like the song of all the birds of spring<br />
He played his flute, and all who heard it cried,<br />
"Strew flowers before our rulers to the Ring."<br />
The courtiers hurried for their coats of pride<br />
The upturned faces in that market wide<br />
Glowed in the sunset to a beauty grave<br />
Such as the faces of immortals have.<br />
<br />
And work was laid aside on desk and bench,<br />
The red-lined ledger summed no penny more,<br />
From lamp-blacked fingers the mechanic's wrench<br />
Dropped to the kinking wheel chains on the floor,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>The farmer shut the hen roost: at the store<br />
The boys put up the shutters and ran hooting<br />
Wild with delight in freedom to the fluting.<br />
<br />
And now the fluting led that gathered tide<br />
Of men and women forward through the town,<br />
And flowers seemed to fall from every side,<br />
White starry blossoms such as brooks bow down,<br />
White petals clinging in the hair and gown;<br />
And those who marched there thought that starry flowers<br />
Grew at their sides, as though the streets were bowers.<br />
<br />
And all, in marching, thought, "We go to see<br />
Life, not the daily coil, but as it is<br />
Lived in its beauty in eternity,<br />
Above base aim, beyond our miseries;<br />
Life that is speed and colour and bright bliss,<br />
And beauty seen and strained for, and possest<br />
Even as a star forever in the breast."<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span><br />
The fluting led them through the western gate,<br />
From many a tossing torch their faces glowed,<br />
Bright-eyed and ruddy-featured and elate;<br />
They sang and scattered flowers upon the road,<br />
Still in their hair the starry blossoms snowed;<br />
They saw ahead the green-striped tent, their mark,<br />
Lit now and busy in the gathering dark.<br />
<br />
There at the vans and in the green-striped tent<br />
The circus artists growled their discontent.<br />
Close to the gate a lighted van there was;<br />
The showman's wife thrust back its window glass.<br />
And leaned her head without to see who came<br />
To buy a ticket for the evening's game.<br />
<br />
A roll of tickets and a plate of pence<br />
(For change) lay by her as she leaned from thence.<br />
She heard the crowd afar, but in her thought<br />
She said: "That's in the city; it is nought.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>They glorify the Queen."<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 12.5em;">Though sick at heart</span><br />
She wore her spangles for her evening's part,<br />
To dance upon the barebacked horse and sing.<br />
Green velvet was her dress, with tinselling.<br />
Her sad, worn face had all the nobleness<br />
That lovely spirits gather from distress.<br />
<br />
"No one to-night," she thought, "no one to-night."<br />
<br />
Within the tent, a flare gave blowing light.<br />
There, in their scarlet cart, the bandsmen tuned<br />
Bugles that whinnied, flageolets that crooned<br />
And strings that whined and grunted.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">Near the band</span><br />
Piebald and magpie horses stood at hand<br />
Nosing at grass beneath the green-striped dome<br />
While men caressed them with the curry-comb.<br />
<br />
The clowns, with whited, raddled faces, heaped<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>Old horse cloths round them to the chins; they peeped<br />
Above the rugs; their cigarette ends' light<br />
Showing black eyes, and scarlet smears and white.<br />
<br />
They watched the empty benches, and the wry<br />
Green curtain door which no one entered by.<br />
<br />
Two little children entered and sat still<br />
With bright wide-opened eyes that stared their fill,<br />
And red lips round in wonder smeared with tints<br />
From hands and handkerchiefs and peppermints.<br />
<br />
A farm lad entered. That was all the house.<br />
<br />
"Strike up the band to give the folk a rouse,"<br />
The showman said, "They must be all outside."<br />
He said it boldly, though he knew he lied.<br />
<br />
Sad as a funeral march for pleasure gone<br />
The band lamented out, "He's got them on."<br />
Then paused, as usual, for the crowd to come.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span><br />
Nobody came, though from without a hum<br />
Of instruments and singing slowly rose.<br />
"Free feast, with fireworks and public shows,"<br />
The bandsmen growled, "An empty house again.<br />
Two children and a ploughboy and the rain.<br />
And then a night march through the mud," they said.<br />
<br />
Now to the gate, King Cole his piping played.<br />
The showman's wife from out her window peering<br />
Saw, in the road, a crowd with lanterns nearing,<br />
And, just below her perch, a man who shone<br />
As though white flame were his caparison;<br />
One upon whom the great-eyed hawk-moths tense<br />
Settled with feathery feet and quivering sense,<br />
Till the white, gleaming robe seemed stuck with eyes.<br />
<br />
It was the grinning glitterer, white and wise,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>King Cole, who said, "Madam, the Court is here,<br />
The Court, the Prince, the Queen, all drawing near,<br />
We here, the vanguard, set them on their way.<br />
They come intent to see your circus play.<br />
They ask that all who wish may enter free,<br />
And in their princely hope that this may be<br />
They send you these plump bags of minted gold."<br />
He gave a sack that she could scarcely hold.<br />
She dropped it trembling, muttering thanks, and then<br />
She cried: "O master, I must tell the men."<br />
<br />
She rushed out of her van: she reached the Ring;<br />
Called to her husband, "Will, the Queen and King,<br />
Here at the very gate to see the show!"<br />
<br />
"Light some more flares," said Will, "to make a glow.<br />
'God save the Queen,' there, bandsmen; lively, boys.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>Come on, 'God save our gracious'; make a noise.<br />
Here, John, bring on the piebalds to the centre,<br />
We'll have the horses kneeling as they enter."<br />
All sang, and rushed. Without, the trumpets blared.<br />
<br />
Now children, carrying paper lanterns, made<br />
A glowing alley to the circus door;<br />
Then others scattered flowers to pave a floor,<br />
Along the highway leading from the town.<br />

<p>
Rust-spotted bracken green they scattered down,<br />
Blue cornflowers and withering poppies red,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>Gold charlock, thrift, the purple hardihead,<br />
Harebells, the milfoil white, September clover,<br />
And boughs that berry red when summer's over,<br />
All autumn flowers, with yellow ears of wheat.<br />
<br />
Then with bruised, burning gums that made all sweet,<br />
Came censer-bearing pages, and then came<br />
Bearers in white with cressets full of flame,<br />
Whose red tongues made the shadows dance like devils.<br />
Then the blithe flutes that pipe men to the revels<br />
Thrilled to the marrow softly as men marched.<br />
Then, tossing leopard-skins from crests that arched,<br />
The horses of the kettle-drummers stept.<br />
Then with a glitter of bright steel there swept<br />
The guard of knights, each pennon-bearer bold<br />
Girt in a crimson cloak with spangs of gold.<br />
Then came the Sword and Mace, and then the four<br />
Long silver trumpets thrilling to the core<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>Of people's hearts their sound. Then two by two,<br />
Proud in caparisons of kingly blue,<br />
Bitted with bars of gold, in silver shod,<br />
Treading like kings, cream-coloured stallions trod,<br />
Dragging the carriage with the Prince and Queen.<br />
The Corporation, walking, closed the scene.<br />
Then came the crowd in-surging like the wave<br />
That closes up the gash the clipper clave.<br />
<br />
Swift in the path their majesties would tread<br />
The showman flung green baize and turkey red.<br />
Within the tent, with bunting, ropes and bags<br />
They made a Royal Box festooned with flags.<br />
Even as the Queen arrived, the work was done,<br />
The seven piebald horses kneeled like one,<br />
The bandsmen blew their best, while, red as beet,<br />
The showman bowed his rulers to their seat.<br />
<br />
Then, through the door, came courtiers wigged and starred;<br />
The crimson glitterers of the bodyguard;<br />
The ladies of the Court, broad-browed and noble,<br />

<p>
Lovely as evening stars o'er seas in trouble;<br />
The aldermen, in furs, with golden chains,<br />
Old cottagers in smocks from country lanes,<br />
Shepherds half dumb from silence on the down,<br />
And merchants with their households from the town,<br />
And, in the front, two rows of eager-hearted<br />
Children with shining eyes and red lips parted.<br />
<br />
Even as the creeping waves that brim the pool<br />
One following other filled the circus full.<br />
<br />
The showman stood beside his trembling wife.<br />
"Never," he said, "in all our travelling life<br />
Has this old tent looked thus, the front seats full<br />
With happy little children beautiful.<br />
Then all this glorious Court, tier after tier!<br />
O would our son, the wanderer, were here,<br />
Then we'd die happy!"<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 11.5em;">"Would he were!" said she.</span><br />
"It was my preaching forced him to be free,"<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>The showman said.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 9.5em;">"Ah, no," his wife replied,</span><br />
"The great world's glory and the young blood's pride,<br />
Those forced him from us, never you, my dear."<br />
<br />
"I would be different if we had him here<br />
Again," the showman said; "but we must start.<br />
But all this splendour takes away my heart,<br />
I am not used to playing to the King."<br />
<br />
"Look," said his wife, "the stranger, in the Ring."<br />
<br />
There in the Ring, indeed, the stranger stood,<br />
King Cole, the shining, with his flute of wood,<br />
Waiting until the chattering Court was stilled.<br />
<br />
Then from his wooden flute his piping thrilled,<br />
Then all was tense, and then the leaping fluting<br />
Clamoured as flowering clamours for the fruiting.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span><br />
And round the ring came Dodo, the brown mare,<br />
Pied like a tiger-moth; her bright shoes tare<br />
The scattered petals, while the clown came after<br />
Like life, a beauty chased by tragic laughter.<br />
The showman entered in and cracked his whip.<br />
<br />
Then followed fun and skill and horsemanship,<br />
Marvellous all, for all were at their best.<br />
Never had playing gone with such a zest<br />
To those good jesters; never had the tent<br />
So swiftly answered to their merriment<br />
With cheers, the artist's help, the actor's life.<br />
Then, at the end, the showman and his wife<br />
Stood at the entrance listening to the cheers.<br />
They were both happy to the brink of tears.<br />
<br />
King Cole came close and whispered in their ears:<br />
"There is a soldier here who says he knew<br />
You, long ago, and asks to speak to you.<br />
A sergeant in the guard, a handsome blade."<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span><br />
"Mother!" the sergeant said. "What, Jack!" she said,<br />
"Our son come back! look, father, here's our son!"<br />
<br />
"Bad pennies do come home to everyone,"<br />
The sergeant said. "And if you'll have me home,<br />
And both forgive me, I'll be glad to come."<br />
<br />
"Why, son," the showman said, "the fault was ours."<br />
<br />
Now a bright herald trod across the flowers<br />
To bid the artists to the Queen and King,<br />
Who thanked them for the joyful evening,<br />
And shook each artist's hand with words of praise.<br />
"Our happiest hour," they said, "for many days.<br />
You must perform at Court at Christmas tide."<br />
<br />
They left their box: men flung the curtains wide,<br />
The horses kneeled like one as they withdrew.<br />

<p>
They reached the curtained door and loitered through.<br />
The audience, standing, sang "God save the Queen."<br />
The hour of the showman's life had been.<br />
<br />
Now once again a herald crossed the green<br />
To tell the showman that a feast was laid,<br />
A supper for the artists who had played<br />
By the Queen's order, in a tent without.<br />
<br />
In the bright moonlight at the gate the rout<br />
Of courtiers, formed procession to be gone,<br />
Orders were called, steel clinked, and jewels shone,<br />
The watchers climbed the banks and took their stands.<br />
<br />
The circus artists shook each others' hands,<br />
Their quarrels were forgotten and forgiven,<br />
Old friendships were restored and sinners shriven.<br />
"We find we cannot part from Will," they said.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span><br />
And while they talked the juggler took the maid<br />
Molly, the singer, to the hawthorn glade<br />
Behind the green-striped tent, and told his love,<br />
A wild delight, beyond her hope, enough<br />
Beyond her dream to brim her eyes with tears.<br />
<br />
Now came a ringing cry to march; and cheers<br />
Rose from the crowd; the bright procession fared<br />
Back to the city while the trumpets blared.<br />
<br />
So the night ended, and the Court retired.<br />
Back to the town the swaying torches reeked,<br />
Within the green-striped tent the lights expired,<br />
The dew dript from the canvas where it leaked.<br />
Dark, in the showman's van, a cricket creaked,<br />
But, near the waggons, fire was glowing red<br />
On happy faces where the feast was spread.<br />
<br />
Gladly they supped, those artists of the show;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>Then by the perfect moon, together timed,<br />
They struck the green-striped tent and laid it low,<br />
Even as the quarter before midnight chimed.<br />
Then putting-to the piebald nags, they climbed<br />
Into their vans and slowly stole away<br />
Along Blown Hilcote on the Icknield Way.<br />
<br />
And as the rumbling of the waggons died<br />
By Aston Tirrold and the Moretons twain,<br />
With axle-clatter in the countryside,<br />
Lit by the moon and fragrant from the rain,<br />
King Cole moved softly in the Ring again,<br />
Where now the owls and he were left alone:<br />
The night was loud with water upon stone.<br />
<br />
He watched the night; then taking up his flute,<br />
He breathed a piping of this life of ours,<br />
The half-seen prize, the difficult pursuit,<br />
The passionate lusts that shut us in their towers,<br />
The love that helps us on, the fear that lowers,<br />
The pride that makes us and the pride that mars,<br />
The beauty and the truth that are our stars.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span><br />
And man, the marvellous thing, that in the dark<br />
Works with his little strength to make a light,<br />
His wit that strikes, his hope that tends, a spark,<br />
His sorrow of soul in toil, that brings delight,<br />
His friends, who make salt sweet and blackness bright,<br />
His birth and growth and change; and death the wise,<br />
His peace, that puts a hand upon his eyes.<br />
<br />
All these his pipings breathed of, until twelve<br />
Struck on the belfry tower with tremblings numb<br />
(Such as will shudder in the axe's helve<br />
When the head strikes) to tell his hour was come.<br />
Out of the living world of Christendom<br />
He dimmed like mist till one could scarcely note<br />
The robins nestling to his old grey coat.<br />
<br />
Dimmer he grew, yet still a glimmering stayed<br />
Like light on cobwebs, but it dimmed and died.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>Then there was naught but moonlight in the glade,<br />
Moonlight and water and an owl that cried.<br />
Far overhead a rush of birds' wings sighed,<br />
From migrants going south until the spring.<br />
The night seemed fanned by an immortal wing.<br />
<br />
But where the juggler trudged beside his love<br />
Each felt a touching from beyond our ken,<br />
From that bright kingdom where the souls who strove,<br />
Live now forever, helping living men.<br />
And as they kissed each other; even then<br />
Their brows seemed blessed, as though a hand unseen<br />
Had crowned their loves with never-withering green.<br />

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
