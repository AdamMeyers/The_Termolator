CAUSE OF FREEDOM AND THE SAFETY
OF THE EMPIRE.





PREFACE



Nearly all these Poems have appeared during the past year in the
columns of the Globe and the Mail and Empire of Toronto, and the
Free Press of Detroit, Michigan.



When the Author read from his poems last winter before the Women's
Press Club of Toronto one of its members suggested that an engrossed
and illuminated copy of the poem, "I Take Off My Hat to Albert," be
presented to His Majesty, King Albert of Belgium.  This was done
through the kind offices and courtesy of Mr. Goor, the Belgian
Consul-General at Ottawa.



His Majesty's gracious letter of acceptance, which the reader will find
on another page, is indeed a Royal Foreword to these poetic blossoms of
a piteous though heroic time.

Letter from the King of Belgium








TRANSLATION





LA PANNE, August 11th, 1915.



OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY TO THE KING AND
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QUEEN (OF BELGIUM).



SIR:



The very delicate words you have found to express to the King your
friendly feelings have greatly touched His Majesty.



The Sovereign, Who has much admired the beautiful illumination adorning
the verses composed in His honor, commands me to thank you sincerely
and to say that He will be glad to keep this valuable souvenir.



I have the honor to be
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir
Your obedient Servant,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;J. INGENBLEEK,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secretary.



To DR. THOMAS O'HAGAN,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ottawa.






I TAKE OFF MY HAT TO ALBERT



Albert, King of Belgium, is the hero of the hour;
He's the greatest king in Europe, he's a royal arch and tower;
He is bigger in the trenches than the Kaiser on his Throne,
And the whole world loves him for the sorrows he has known:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I take off my hat to Albert.



Defiance was his answer to the Teuton at his gate,
Then he buckled on his armor and pledged his soul to fate;
He stood between his people and the biggest Essen gun,
For he feared not shot nor shrapnel as his little army won:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I take off my hat to Albert.



King of Belgium, Duke of Brabant, Count of Flanders, all in one;
Little Kingdom of the Belgae starr'd with honor in the sun!
You have won a place in history, of your deeds the world will sing,
But the glory of your nation is your dust-stained, fearless King:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I take off my hat to Albert.



For M. Goor.






THE KAISER'S FAVORITE POEMS



What are the Kaiser's favorite poems?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, now, you tax me hard:
I know the Kaiser's favorite drink
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But do not know his bard;
I'm sure it is not Schiller
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who reigns in German homes.
Nor yet Olympian Goethe,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who writes the Kaiser's poems.



Perhaps that Heinrich Heine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has touched the Kaiser's soul;
Or Arndt with his trumpet call
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a new conscription roll;
Or, Walther von der Vogelweide
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his nest in mythic domes,
Is the author and creator
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the Kaiser's favorite poems.



If I saw the Kaiser's library
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'd know well what he reads&mdash;
The color of his fancy
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the prompter of his deeds:
I'd learn the depth and wisdom
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of his theories and his gnomes,
If I got but just a glance or two
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the Kaiser's favorite poems.



Then let us go to Essen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the Kaiser's books are bound;
They are full of "steel" engravings&mdash;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All "best sellers" there are found;
For the Prussian soul and spirit
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaks in rhythm thro' those tomes,
And these without a question,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are the Kaiser's favorite poems.



For Rt. Hon. David Lloyd-George.






LOUVAIN



A shrine, where saints and scholars met
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And held aloft the torch of truth,
Lies smouldering 'neath fair Brabant's skies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A ruined heap&mdash;war's prize in sooth!
The Pilates of Teutonic blood
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That fired the brand and flung the bomb
Now wash their hands of evil deed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While all the world stands ghast and dumb.



Is this your culture, sons of Kant,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ye who kneel 'round Goethe's throne?
To carry in your knapsacks death?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To feel for man nor ruth nor moan?
What 'vails it now your mighty guns
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If God be mightier in the sky?
What 'vail your cities, walls and towers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If half your progress be a lie?



The smoking altars, ruined arch
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of ancient church and Gothic fane
Have felt the death stings of your shells,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And speak in pity thro' Louvain.
Wheel back your guns, your howitzers melt,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forget your "World-Power's" cursed plan
And sign in peace and not in blood
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dread Sinai's pact 'twixt God and Man.



For His Eminence Cardinal Merrier.






THE KAISER'S BHOYS



O, the Kaiser's bhoys are marching, "nach Paris" they are going,
But they've sthopped to rest a minit at the Marne and at the Meuse;
And the Gordons and the Ministers are thryin' to entertain them,
For they've every kind of "record" that the Teutons want to choose;
They have battle cries that sounded for centuries in the Highlands,
They have war cries fierce and stirring as the breath of Munster gales;
They are shoutin' to the heavens, and they're shoutin' to the Kaiser,
"Faugh-a-ballagh!" sons of Odin, or we'll tie you up like bales.



O, the Kaiser's bhoys are dramin' of a naval base at Calais,
But they wakin' ivery mornin' full of sorrow and of gloom;
For the little Belgian sojers cut the dykes and flood their trenches,
And they find their dugouts only jist a bathtub or a tomb.
But they're makin' progress backward, "nach Berlin" they are going,
With their "Landsturms" and their "Land-wehrs,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;keepin' sthep in dim grey line;
And they'll know far more of Britain and her brood of lions snarlin',
When they find themselves "su Hause" jist beyant
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Die Wacht am Rhein."



For John E. Redmond, M.P.






MOTHERS



Through the vigils deep of the sable night
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mother sits in grief alone,
For her sons have gone to the battle front
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And left on the hearth a crushing stone.
Beyond the stars that burn at night
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sees God's arm in pity reach;
It counsels patience, love and faith,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heroic hearts and souls to teach.



The blue is spann'd and the tide goes out.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the stars rain down a kindlier cheer;
And the mother turns from this throne of grief
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To pierce the years with a joyous tear;
For duty born of a mother's heart
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fills all the rounds of our common day&mdash;
Yea, sheds its joy in the darkest night,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fills with light each hidden way.



For Miss Ina Coolbrith.






IN THE TRENCHES



All day the guns belched fire and death
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And filled the hours with gloom;
The fateful music smote the sky
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In tremulous bars of doom;
But as the evening stars came forth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A truce to death and strife,
There rose from hearts of patriot love
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tender song of life.



A song of home and fireside
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swelled on the evening air,
And men forgot their battle line,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its carnage and dark care;
The soldier dropp'd his rifle
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And joined the choral song,
As high above the tide of war
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It swept and pulsed along.



That night while sleeping where the stars
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look down upon the Meuse,
Where Teuton valor coped with Frank,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where rained most deadly dews,
A soldier youth, in khaki clad,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rock'd where the maples grow,
Smiled in his dream and saw again
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue St. Lawrence flow.



For Miss Julia O'Sullivan.






THE CHRIST-CHILD



Across the waste, across the snow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O the pity!  O the pity!
Past sentinel of friend and foe
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O the pity!  O the pity!
Comes the Christ-Child clad in white
Through the storm-clouds of the night.
Bearing in His lily hands
Gift of peace to warring lands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O the pity!  O the pity!



"Adeste fideles!" sing the choirs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O the pity!  O the pity!
Lurid flame the battle fires
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O the pity!  O the pity!
Shepherds hear the heavenly song,
Mid the strife and piteous wrong;
Peace on earth but not of men,
Peace that knows not crime nor sin.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O the pity!  O the pity!



Lay your sceptres at His feet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O the pity!  O the pity!
Christ, the Babe of Bethlehem, greet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O the pity!  O the pity!
Legions stretched in battle line,
Saw the star and knew the sign,
Yet forgot that Christ was born
Prince of Peace, on Christmas morn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O the pity!  O the pity!



Christmas, 1914.



For Mrs. George McIntyre.






GOD'S NEW YEAR'S GIFT



What shall the coming year bring forth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Lord, who rulest the land?
For the navies of the sea and air
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are but stubble in Thy hand.
The battalions in the field go forth;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They arm in mighty line;
Do they kneel to know Thy holy will?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have they asked from Thee a sign?



The kings invoke Thy holy name,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their carnage and their strife;
But the purple gift it was Thine to give
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recks not of pity nor life:
For they're drunk with the wine of lustful power,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And seared with the sins of earth;
And their prayers and preachments now mock Thy name,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And make of Thy laws but mirth.



January 1, 1916.



For Duncan Campbell Scott.






TROUBLE IN THE LOUVRE



When the German troops were marching with the Uhlans far ahead,
The objective point being Paris, as the Berlin wireless said,
There was trouble in the Louvre, 'mong the paintings on the walls,
There were shoutings 'cross the centuries, there were
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;loud artistic calls;
"Mona Lisa" ceased her smiling and "The Banker and His Wife"
Turned to Millet's "Women Gleaning"&mdash;begged protection
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for their life;
While "The Gypsy Girl" of Franz Hals, fearful of impending fate,
Roused "The Shepherds in Arcadia" with "The Hun is at the Gate!"



Then the panic spread on all sides till the battle of the Marne
Solved all danger of the looting, removed all need to warn;
Straight "The Lace Maker" from Flemish Bruges in the joyous choral led
Smiled at "Charles First of England" who had lost his crown and head;
For fear had left the Louvre when the Teutons turned in flight,
So they scanned the sky no longer for dread Zeppelins in the night.
And the paintings born of centuries touched by genius into life
Still are hanging in the Louvre 'mid war's clash and clang and strife.



For Edgar Guest.






"BOBS" OF KANDAHAR



"The body of 'Bobs' then lay in state until five o'clock, when it was
interred in a crypt near-by those containing the bodies of Nelson and
Wellington."&mdash;Press Despatch.





Who is he that cometh to join our mighty dead?
Is it "Bobs" of Kandahar the Empire's armies led?
Give him place, O Nation great! within your storied walls;
Within our heart his name shall rest, his ashes in St. Paul's.
Soldier of the Empire, Bobs of Kandahar!
Lay him near the hero of glorious Trafalgar!
Death has ta'en the shining sword he aye in duty drew;
Lay him near the Iron Duke of fateful Waterloo!



Soldier of the Empire, well thy work was done,
Fit thy sun had setting within sound and roar of gun;
Thy soul had vision of the years fraught with danger's woe,
And counsell'd arméd wisdom against a subtle foe;
Now thy task has ended, the splendor of thy sun,
Sheds its setting glory on the greater life begun,
From where the Maple stands in pride to India's torrid star,
Now, mourn an Empire's people for "Bobs" of Kandahar!



For Lady Aileen Mary Roberts.






SONG OF THE ZEPPELIN



I cleave the air through the murky night,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High o'er the forests and sleeping towns;
Below me drifts the shimmering light&mdash;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A glorious fresco on vale and downs;
My sea hath no billows nor rocky shores,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And only the winds disturb my soul;
I care not for those who slumber in death,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For my bomb is bloody and death my goal&mdash;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all for the Vaterland!



Where the currents cross and the cruisers speed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sail towards the North in a piteous sky;
I hear the night wind's surging note
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it mingles its requiem with the widow's cry.
Above me there streams a light from heaven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I bow my head and veil my eyes
As I plough the fields with my fateful keel
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sow the highways with tears and sighs&mdash;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all for the Vaterland!



And hate is the banner I unfurl so wide
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That its blood-dripp'd folds may catch the breeze;
That e'en from the balcony of heaven on high
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May be seen this banner on all the seas.
No triumph of arms is my flight by night,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is only a part of a murderous raid:
Dropping a bomb on an innocent child
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or a crowing babe in its cradle laid&mdash;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all for the Vaterland!



For Thomas Walsh.






"SOCK IT TO 'EM"



"A Canadian lieutenant writes his mother from the front that what he
most needs for the winter is good warm socks."&mdash;Press Despatch.





Yes, Wilhelm, sure you'll get it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The storm is o'er your head;
It is bursting in the trenches
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you're just as good as dead.
You put your foot on Belgium
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And defied your fate and doom,
And now the whole world hates you
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the cry is "Sock it to 'em!"



True, your Taubchens still are sailing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But your battleships are not;
They are coop'd up in a corner
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Save the submerg'd ones that fought.
You are saving time and fuel,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you're sad and filled with gloom,
For the very winds are whispering
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Blow hard and sock it to 'em."



You have sought more spacious realm
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the free and genial sun:
Has your sceptre widened any
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the salvo of each gun?
Your "World-Power" seems to narrow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And your hope lies in a tomb,
While dark Fate weaves your chaplet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And whispers "Sock it to 'em!"



For Theodore Botrel.






LANGEMARCK



A glory lights the skies of Flanders
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the blood-stained fields lie bare,
Where the clouds of war have gathered,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Built their parapets in the air;
Halted stands the Teuton army,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Checked its onslaught at a sign;
Forward roll the warlike forces,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sons of Canada in line.



Let them taste of Northern courage
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the lordly maple grows;
Let them face the heroes nurtured
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the stars have wed the snows;
We are sons of sires undaunted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Children of the hills and plains;
Ours a courage born of duty,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pluck and dash of many strains.



Tell it to our children's children
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How Canadians saved the day;
Write it with the pen of history,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sing it as a fireside lay;
How at Langemarck in Flanders,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though the odds were eight to one,
Our Canadians stood unbroken,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sword to sword, and gun to gun.



For Sir Wilfrid Laurier.






THE BUGLE CALL



Do you hear the call of our Mother,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From over the sea, from over the sea?
The call to her children, in every land;
To her sons on Afric's far-stretch'd veldt;
To her dark-skinned children on India's shore,
Whose souls are nourish'd on Aryan lore;
To her sons of the Northland where frosty stars
Glitter and shine like a helmet of Mars;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you hear the call of our Mother?



Do you hear the call of our Mother
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From over the sea, from over the sea?
The call to Australia's legions strong,
That move with the might and stealth of a wave;
To the men of the camp and men of the field,
Whose courage has taught them never to yield;
To the men whose counsel has saved the State,
And thwarted the plans of impending fate;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you hear the call of our Mother?



Do you hear the call of our Mother
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From over the sea, from over the sea?
To the little cot on the wind-swept hill;
To the lordly mansion in the city street;
To her sons who toil in the forest deep
Or bind the sheaves where the reapers reap;
To her children scattered far East and West;
To her sons who joy in her Freedom Blest;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you hear the call of our Mother?



For Major-General Sir Sam Hughes.






HIS MISSION



"A German will teach Irish at the University of Illinois, beginning in
February, when Dr. Kuno E. Meyer of the University of Berlin will
become visiting professor of the Celtic language and
literature."&mdash;Press Despatch.





Go back, dear Kuno, to the Poles and Alsatians,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And teach them the language your nation has robbed;
Piece out their dreams of new glory and freedom;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bring joy to the hearts where the children have sobbed.
We love the old Celtic tongue, vibrant with music,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it speaks to our hearts thro' the chords of long years,
But we don't want your lessons, though laden with "Kultur,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a land where Alsatians and Poles are in tears.



Go back, Herr Professor, your mission is ended,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For, though your gifts are many, you are "ausgespielt";
Go back and receive your "Kreuz von Eisen,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For we don't like the way that you're "ausgebild't."
The stars that burn with the true light of freedom,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this giant new world, with its endless day,
Have nothing in common with your satellite planets,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And care not to shine on your Eagle's prey.



For Dr. Douglas Hyde.






ACHILLES' TOMB



Achilles awoke in his ancient tomb
Hard by the coast of Troy;
He rattled his armor now full of dust
And rubbed his eyes like a boy,
As he gazed on the ships of the allied fleet,
Ploughing the seas from afar,
Bent on their course to the Dardanelles
'Neath the light of Victory's star.



"Why, I've been asleep," Achilles said,
"On the windy plains of Troy;
Three thousand years have turned to dust
With their maddening mirth and joy;
Yet it seems but a day since Ilium fell,
Since Sinon spun out his tale,
And the Greeks returned from Tenedos
With a light and prosperous gale.



"Three thousand years is a long, long time,
But I'll doze for a thousand more;
For I'm sick of the bluff of the Teuton hosts
And the gas from each army corps.
So lay me down in my ancient tomb,
Where the Phrygian winds sweep by,
And I'll dream of the days when heroes fought,
'Round the lofty walls of Troy."



For Very Rev. W. R. Harris, D.D.






THE CHRISM OF KINGS



In the morn of the world, at the daybreak of time,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Kingdoms were few and Empires unknown,
God searched for a Ruler to sceptre the land,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And gather the harvest from the seed He had sown.
He found a young Shepherd boy watching his flock
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the mountains looked down on deep meadows of green;
He hailed the young Shepherd boy king of the land
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And anointed his brow with a Chrism unseen.



He placed in his frail hands the sceptre of power,
And taught his young heart all the wisdom of love;
He gave him the vision of prophet and priest,
And dowered him with counsel and light from above.
But alas! came a day when the Shepherd forgot
And heaped on his realm all the woes that war brings,
And bartering his purple for the greed of his heart
He lost both the sceptre and Chrism of Kings.



For Miss Katherine Brégy.






TIPPERARY



(New version.)



I'm not going to Tipperary for I've better work to do,
I am dreaming of a new device to catch each German crew;
And when we've chased them thro' the deep, Ach Gott! what
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fun there'll be
Rounding up the Teuton "subs" in the blue and vasty sea.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, good-bye, Tipperary! Farewell, Slieve-na-mon!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I leave you for a season to chase the murderous Hun;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Von Tirpitz knows their hiding-place and I'll find out, too,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, good-bye, Tipperary, till we've caught each pirate crew.



Then I'll go to Tipperary with its hills of emerald green,
Where the skies are full of splendor and each peasant girl a queen;
Where the men know naught but honor and where duty is their goal;
Where the shadows from the mountains are but sunlight to the soul.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, good-bye, Tipperary, till we've rounded up each crew,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I'll turn my face to greet you for to you I'll e'er be true;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I'm off to chase the pirates and the ocean aisles to sweep,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ach Himmel, Tipperary! there'll be fun upon the deep.



For Rev. J. B. Bollard.






GATHER THE HARVEST



Gather the harvest though reaped in death,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the pale, pale moon;
For the lilies that joyed in the breath of morn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall know not the ardor of noon:
So, the souls that grow strong, in patriot love,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall be garnered on Death's dark field,
Ere the noontide rays have touched the vale
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And burnished with gold life's shield.



Gather the harvest though reaped in death,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the sword has struck for Right,
And cleft a way for Freedom's path,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the dark and tremulous night:
For the golden grain on the altar flames
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lights each pilgrim throng,
As they meet in joy 'round that altar bright
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where Justice shall right each wrong.



For Miss Helen Merrill.






THE KAISER'S "PLACE IN THE SUN"



The Kaiser is seeking "a place in the Sun"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I fear he'll have to wait,
Till another eclipse has dulled its face
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Allies have woven his fate:
For the "spots" on the Sun are all occupied
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a race descended from Mars;
So there's no place in the heavens for schrecklich Wilhelm,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not even among the Stars.



What boots it, Wilhelm, that your guns are big,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And your Zeppelins soar by night,
Since against you are leagued the earth and stars
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you're sure to lose in the fight.
You have drenched the world with heroic blood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stained the record of Man,
But you'll presently get your "place in the Sun,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the hottest since time began,



For T. J. Murphy.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
