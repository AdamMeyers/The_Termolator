TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE

TO THIS EDITION.


It is to the patient industry of the historians of
Germany, that we are indebted for the first production
of Manuals of history, and for those synchronistic
tables which have so much facilitated
the systematic study of ancient history; and
among the various and profound treatises of this
class which enrich and adorn their literature, the
works of Heeren are distinguished by their extended
range of enquiry, as well as by the minute
accuracy of their details.

The work before us embodies the result of his
laborious researches during the long period in
which he has been engaged as public lecturer
and professor of history in the university of Goettingen;
and if it be any recommendation of a
work to know that its writer has had ample time,
ability, and opportunity to collect and elaborate
his materials, it may be asserted, without fear of
contradiction, that the author of the present work
possessed all these advantages in an eminent degree.
He has spent the greater portion of his
life in lecturing upon the subjects of which it
treats, and has in every case gone for his information
immediately to the fountain head. It forms,
too, an important feature of his work, that a list
of the original sources, whence his own know[Pg iv]ledge
has been drawn, is placed at the head of
each section; another is added of the principal
writers who have touched upon or illustrated the
particular portion of history under notice; both
being generally accompanied with a few words of
judicious criticism, in which the value of the
writer's authority is estimated, and his sources,
circumstances, and prejudices, briefly, but fairly
set forth. Besides this advantage, the work possesses
the merit of combining the convenience of
the Manuals with the synchronistic method of
instruction; as the geography, chronology, and
biography of the countries and states of the ancient
world are brought at once under the eye of
the reader; and so lucid is the arrangement, that
the darkest and most entangled portions of history
are seen in a clear and perspicuous light.
Professor Heeren seems, moreover, to possess in
a more eminent degree than any other writer, the
power of forcing, by a very few words, the attention
of the reader upon the most important facts
of history; and of conjuring up in his thoughts a
train of reflections calculated at once to instruct
and enlarge the mind. His work is not only admirably
adapted to become a text-book in the study
of history, but will be found equally serviceable as
a book of reference&mdash;it will guide the student in
his untried and intricate course, and enable the
more advanced scholar to methodize his collected
stores. Perhaps in no work has so much important
information been condensed into so small a
compass.

The estimation in which this Manual is held
on the continent, may be gathered from the[Pg v]
fact of its having passed through six large editions
in German, and two in French, and from its
having been translated into almost every language
of Europe.

The rapidity with which the first edition, as
well as the other writings of professor Heeren,
have sold in this country, is a proof that they only
required to be known here in order to be appreciated.
The favour with which these translations
have been received, both by the venerable author
himself and by the British public, has been a
source of the highest gratification to the publisher.
The encouragement, so kindly bestowed, has urged
him to new exertions, the fruits of which, he trusts,
will be observable in the present volume. The
Manual has not only been revised and corrected
throughout, but has also been diligently compared
with the German, and has received such ameliorations
as the original text or the English style
seemed to demand. When it is added to this
that a very numerous body of corrections and
improvements have been sent to the publisher by
professor Heeren himself, who has patiently examined
the translation expressly for this edition,
he trusts that the public will be satisfied that it is
as faithful a copy of the original work as the nature
of things will allow.

In the preface to the last edition of this Manual
the publisher announced his intention, should it
be favourably received, of following it up by the
publication of another elaborate work of the same
author, viz. A Manual of the History of the
States of Modern Europe and their Colonies,
as forming one political System. This work will[Pg vi]
now very shortly appear. As an apology for the
delay which has taken place, he begs to call to
their notice another equally important work by
the same author, which he has published in the
mean time; the Historical Researches into the
Politics, Intercourse, and Trade of the Carthaginians,
Ethiopians, and Egyptians, with a general
introduction; the remainder of this work, containing
the Historical Researches into the Politics,
Intercourse, and Trade of the Ancient Asiatic
Nations&mdash;the Persians, Ph&#339;nicians, Babylonians,
Scythians, and Hindoos, will appear in a few
weeks.

To add to the usefulness of the work, an analysis
of the contents, with dates, has been given
in the margin. The &#8224; prefixed to some of the
books denote that they are written in German.

PREFACE

TO THE FIRST EDITION.


In adding to the number of Manuals on Ancient
History already published, I feel myself bound
to give an account of the plan on which the present
has been executed.

It was at first designed to be used in my
public lectures, and from them it has grown up
to what it now is. In them I did not consider it
necessary to state all we know or think we know
of ancient history. Many facts highly interesting
to the learned historian are not adapted for public
lectures. It was therefore my great object to
make choice of such incidents as ought to be
known by my pupils in order to the effectual
prosecution of their historical studies. Consequently
I have not extended my labours so far as
to give an historical account of every nation, but
have limited myself to those most remarkable for
their general civilization and political eminence.

The subjects to which I have particularly directed
my attention are, the formation of states,
the changes in their constitution, the routes by
which commerce was carried on, the share which
the different nations respectively took in its pursuit,
and, as immediately connected with that[Pg x]
department, their extension severally by means of
colonies.

The favourable reception which my larger work,
executed after a different plan, has met with,
would lead me to hope for a like indulgence in
this new attempt, even if the spirit of the age did
not so loudly call upon every historian to direct
his chief attention to these subjects. And for
this reason I could not rest satisfied with a mere
detail of isolated facts, but have made it my study
to follow the course of events, linking them into
one connected chain; so as to represent them in
a condensed form by continually and carefully
forcing together the main circumstances which
contributed to the development of the whole.

Without this, history in general would be but
a lifeless study, more especially that of republics,
which were so numerous in ancient times, and
which, from their constitution being made up of
political parties, everywhere present the most
difficult problems for the historian's solution. Of
all the larger divisions of my work, the arrangement
of the Greek history I have found most troublesome,
on account of the number of little states
into which it is sub-divided. Historians, indeed,
lighten this labour by confining themselves merely
to Athens and Sparta; but by so doing they give
us a very imperfect knowledge of the subject. I
have endeavoured to surmount the difficulty by
throwing the account of the smaller states and
their colonies into the second period; by which
means I have been able in the third and most
important portion, the interest of which depends
entirely upon the principal states, to carry on my[Pg xi]
history, as a whole without interruption. But in
case others, who wish to make this Manual the
groundwork of their lectures, should dislike this
arrangement, they may very easily attach these
notices to the introductory geographical survey; a
plan I very often adopt in my own lectures. Upon
the arrangement of the other parts, I am not aware
of the necessity of making any observations. The
sources from which I have drawn my materials
are specified in every section. Particular references
do not come within my plan; and if I have
referred several times in the first two sections to
my larger work, it is only on particular points,
explanations of which may be sought for in vain
elsewhere.

Some knowledge of ancient geography and
the use of maps[a], if it has not been previously
acquired by the student, should, I am convinced,
always be connected with lectures on ancient
history. That this need not extend to detailed
explanations of ancient geography, but that it
should be restricted to what is merely useful in
the study of history, I have observed in the body
of my work. The geographical chapters which
are interspersed having been written with this
intent, will, I hope, be judged of accordingly.
I have taken care to arrange them so as to include
the whole of the ancient world; it depends,
therefore, only upon the teacher to form a more
or less extensive course upon them.

With regard to chronology, I have followed
throughout the same uniform plan of computing[Pg xii]
time, viz. to and from the birth of Christ. By
preferring this method, so convenient and certain,
to the inconvenient and uncertain one of reckoning
from the year of the world, I hope I have deserved
the thanks of my readers. I relinquish,
on the other hand, all claim to merit on the score
of having more accurately defined the chronology
of events which occur before the time of Cyrus.
I have, on the contrary, in this part of my labour,
often stated round numbers, where, in many
modern publications, precise dates may be found.
Exact determinations of time are only necessary,
in my opinion, where a continuous development
of circumstances takes place; not where unconnected
facts are recorded.

The transactions of our own times have thrown
a light upon ancient history, and given it an interest
which it could not formerly possess. A
knowledge of history, if not the only, is at least
the most certain means of obtaining a clear and
unprejudiced view of the great drama now performing
around us. All direct comparisons, notwithstanding
the many opportunities which have
tempted me, I considered as foreign to my plan;
but if, notwithstanding in some chapters of my
work, particularly in the history of the Roman republic,
I may be thought to make a reference to
the transactions of the ten years during which
this work has been published, I do not consider
it necessary to offer any excuse for so doing. Of
what use is the study of history if it do not make
us wiser and better? unless the knowledge of the
past teach us to judge more correctly of the present?
Should I have contributed in any measure[Pg xiii]
to promote this object, and should I be so fortunate
as to lead the minds of my young friends to
a deeper study of a science which can only in this
way reward its admirers, I shall esteem it the most
delightful recompense my labour can receive.


GOETTINGEN, Sept. 23, 1799.

PREFACE

TO THE SECOND AND FOLLOWING EDITIONS.


The call for a second edition of my Manual imposes
upon me an obligation to supply the deficiencies
of my former work. Corrections have
been carefully made, and many parts completely
re-written. A select list of books which treat of
the respective departments of my subject is now
first added; the former edition containing only
references to the sources from which my facts
were derived. This, I trust, will be considered an
essential service to the friends of historical science,
more especially the young, for whom and
not for the learned these additions have been
made. Their use in this place is particularly
obvious, where it is in every one's power to procure
the books referred to[b]. The short criticisms
subjoined, where it seemed necessary, will serve
as guides for their use. In the author's depart[Pg xiv]ment
of the work but little has been changed,
while its form and appearance have been improved
by the use of different types, by more accurate
running titles, and by ranging the dates in
the margin. By the adoption of the latter method
the increase in the number of pages is rendered
inconsiderable, notwithstanding the numerous additions
which have been made to the matter. In
its arrangement, this work is the same as my
Manual of the History of the European States
and their Colonies. Beyond this, however, these
works have no relation to each other, but have
been executed upon quite different principles; the
present as a history of the separate states of the
ancient world, and the other as a general history
of modern states and their colonies, as forming
altogether one political system. Each, however,
forms a complete work in itself, and it is by no
means my intention to fill up the gulf which time
has placed between them.

I regret that the acute researches of M. Volney[c],
upon the chronology of Herodotus before
the time of Cyrus, came too late into my hands
to be made use of in its proper place in my
second edition. In the third this has been
done. I lay claim, at the same time, to the
thanks of the reader for giving, in an Appendix,
the results of these researches, together with
references to the passages by which they are
supported; leaving out, however, all extraneous
matter, and everything that cannot be proved by
the positive assertions of the father of history.

[Pg xv]
I cannot close this preface without again recurring
to the advantage of the mode now becoming
more and more general, of computing
time in ancient history according to the number
of years before Christ. The fact of its being certain
and convenient has often been remarked; but
besides this it possesses the great advantage of
giving us at once a clear and precise notion of the
interval that separates us from the incidents recorded;
which it is impossible to obtain by the
use of any other era, whether the year of the
world, the olympiads, or the year of Rome, etc.
And yet this peculiar advantage, so great in the
eyes of the teacher, has not, to the best of my
knowledge, been hitherto made the subject of remark.
Even for the science of history itself, this
circumstance is of greater moment than might be
at first supposed. Should an enquirer arise who
would closely examine all ancient history according
to this era&mdash;setting out from the generally received
year of the birth of Christ as from a fixed
point, to which the labours of M. Volney are a
good beginning&mdash;the whole science would thereby
acquire a firmer consistency. For by this method
all dates would not appear equally certain and
equally uncertain, as they do in the eras which
are computed from the year of the world; but it
would be shown what is chronologically certain,
what only probable, and what completely uncertain,
according as we should recede from the
clearer into the more obscure regions of history.
The old manner of reckoning from the year of the
world, in which congruity was impossible, because
there was no agreement upon the point to[Pg xvi]
start from, would certainly be thrown aside; but
where is the harm if something better and more
certain be substituted in its place?

In the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth editions,
though the increase in the number of pages is
small, yet all those additions and corrections
which I deemed necessary, and which the progress
of knowledge and discovery, as in the case
of Egypt and other countries, enabled me to
effect, have been most carefully and fully made.
The importance of these will be best seen by
comparison.

MANUAL

OF

ANCIENT HISTORY.




[Pg 1]
INTRODUCTION.


I. The sources of ancient history may be ranged under two
heads; the ancient writers, and the monuments still extant.
The various writers will be mentioned in their proper places, at
the different divisions of this work. A general view of the ancient
monuments, so far as they are sources of history, will be found in:

Oberlin, Orbis antiqui monumentis suis illustrati prim&aelig; line&aelig;.
Argentorati, 1790. Extremely defective, as many discoveries
have been made since it was published.

II. General Treatises on Ancient History.

1. The more voluminous works on the subject. These may be
divided in two classes: a. The part appropriated to ancient history,
in the general treatises on universal history; b. Works exclusively
devoted to ancient history.

a. To the first class belong:

The Universal History, ancient and modern; with maps and
additions. Lond. 1736, 26 vols. folio. Reprinted in 8vo. in
67 vols. and again in 60 vols. with omissions and additions.

This work, compiled by a society of British scholars, has been
translated into German, and illustrated with remarks, by Siegm.
Jac. Baumgarten. Halle, 1746, 4to. The Germans frequently
designate it by the name of the Halle Universal History of the
World: the first eighteen vols. comprise the ancient part.

Will. Guthrie, John Gray, etc. General History of the
World, from the creation to the present time. London, 1764&mdash;1767,
12 vols. 8vo. This work, of no estimation in the original,
is rendered valuable and useful by the labours of the German
translator, C. G. Heyne, (Leip. 1766, 8vo.) who has corrected
the errors, inserted the dates, and added his own observations.

b. To the second class belong:

Rollin, Histoire ancienne des Egyptiens, des Carthaginois,
des Assyriens, des M&egrave;des el des Perses, des Mac&eacute;doniens, des[Pg 2]
Grecs. Paris, 1824, 12 vols. 8vo.; revue par Letronne: the
last and best edition. This work, which greatly promoted the
study of ancient history in France, still maintains its well-earned
reputation. [It was translated into English, 1768: best edition,
7 vols. 8vo.: frequently reprinted.] The above is generally accompanied
by the Histoire Romaine of the same author. See
below, book v. first period, Sources.

Jac. Ben. Bossuet, Discours sur l'Histoire Universelle.
Paris, 1680, 3 vols. Frequently reprinted, being considered by
the French one of their classics.

[English translation, by Rich. Spencer. London, 1730, 8vo.]

Millot, El&eacute;mens de l'Histoire G&eacute;n&eacute;rale. Paris, 1772, sq.
[Translated into English, 1778, 2 vols. 8vo.: and again, an improved
edition, with additions.] Edinb. 1823, 6 vols. 8vo. The
ancient history is contained in the first two volumes.

&#8224;Joh. Matth. Schroeckh, General History of the World,
for the use of children. Leipzic, 1779, sq. 6 vols.

&#8224;J. G. Eichhorn, History of the Ancient World, 1799, third
edition, 1817. (First part of the History of the World.)

&#8224;Dan. G. J. Huebler, Sketch of the General History of the
Nations of Antiquity, from the birth of states to the end of the
Roman commonwealth. Freyberg, 1798&mdash;1802. Five parts;
and a continuation: History of the Romans under the Emperors,
and of the contemporary Nations, until the great migration, 1803;
three parts. A work rendered extremely useful, by the judicious
advantage taken by the author of the labours of other writers.

&#8224;H. Luden, General History of Nations. 1814; three parts.

&#8224;L. Von Dresch, General Political History. 1815; three
parts. In each of the above works the first part contains the
ancient history, and exhibits the more modern views of the
subject.

[The following is added, as well deserving the attention of the
English student: Ralegh (Sir Walter) History of the World,
Part I. extending to the end of the Macedonian Empire; with his
Life and Trial, by Mr. Oldys. Lond. 1736, 2 vols. folio. Formerly
the best edition; but a new and improved one has been
printed at the Clarendon press. Oxford, 1829, 8 vols. 8vo.]

&#8224;F. Von Raumer, Lectures on Ancient History, parts 1, 2.
Berlin, 1821.

Works furnishing illustrations of the progressive civilization,
government, and commerce of early nations, although, strictly
speaking, not treatises on ancient history, are nevertheless very[Pg 3]
closely connected with the subject. Among these may be mentioned:

Goguet, De l'Origine des Lois, des Arts, et des Sciences, et de
leurs progr&egrave;s ch&egrave;z les anciens peuples; nouv. &eacute;dit. Paris, 1778.
[Translated by Dr. Dunn and Mr. Speerman. Edinb. 1761&mdash;1775,
3 vols. 8vo.]

&#8224;A. H. L. Heeren, Reflections on the Politics, Intercourse,
and Trade of the most eminent Nations in the Ancient World.
Third edition, with many additions. Gottingen, 1815, 8vo.; the
third part, 1821. Fourth edition. Gottingen, 1824. [This edition,
the last, contains many improvements and additions, suggested
by the great discoveries of modern travellers. Part I,
Asiatic Nations, in 3 vols. Persians, Ph&#339;nicians, Babylonians,
Scythians, Indians. An English translation of which is at this
moment in the press. Part II, African Nations, 2 vols. Carthaginians,
Ethiopians, Egyptians. Part III, European Nations;
of which only 1 volume, Greeks, has been published.]

2. Manuals, or epitomes.

The Germans are entitled to the merit of having first produced
manuals of ancient history, all of them useful, some excellent, in
their kind: they are a result of the progress made in this science
at the universities.

&#8224;J. Chr. Gatterer, Attempt at an Universal History of the
World to the discovery of America. Gottingen, 1792. He who
possesses this, the last and ripest fruit of Gatterer's studies, may
dispense with the earlier manuals published by that author.

&#8224;Chr. Dan. Beck, A Short Introduction to the Knowledge
of the Universal History of the World and of Nature. Leipzic,
1798. The first part connected with our subject extends to
A. D. 843. This volume is enriched with such a copious and
critical account of books relating to ancient history, that it may
supply the place of a particular work on the subject.

&#8224;J. A. Remer, Manual of the more Ancient History, from the
creation of the world to the great migration. Fourth edition.
Brunswick, 1832.

&#8224;J. M. Schroeckh, Manual of Universal History. 1774:
latest edition, 1795.

&#8224;G. S. Bredow, Manual of Ancient History, with a sketch of
the chronology of the ancients. Altona, 1799, 8vo. [Translated
into English. Lond. 1828, 12mo. In English we have:

The Outlines of History, in 1 vol. (forming part of Lardner's
Cabinet Cyclop&aelig;dia) by Mr. Keightly, author of a learned and[Pg 4]
highly useful work on Grecian Mythology, is a convenient
abridgement. Tytler's Elements of General History, improved
and continued by Dr. Nares. Lond. 1825, best edition; owes
its reputation and success to the want of a better work on the
subject.]

3. Helps.

Among the works subservient to the study of ancient history,
the first rank is justly due to the synchronistic tables.

&#8224;D. G. J. Huebler, Synchronistic Tables of the History of
Nations; arranged principally according to Gatterer's History
of the World. In two numbers. Second edit. 1799 and 1804.

Object of history.

1. The object of Political History
is to recount the destinies of nations, both in respect to
their foreign relations and internal affairs. In regard
to domestic concerns, one of its most important
objects is the history of governments: in
respect to external affairs, it comprises not only
an account of the wars, but likewise of the friendly
relations and intercourse with other states.

Observe here the difference between universal history, or general
history of the human race, and the history of nations; the
latter forms part of the former. Observe also the difference between
political history and that of civilization, or of man as a
human being: the latter is merely the history of man, as man,
without regard to political circumstances.

Divided into three parts:
first, to A. D. 500,
second, to A. D. 1500,
third, to our own times.

2. Universal political history is usually
divided into three parts: ancient history, that of the middle
ages, and modern history.
The first extends to the fall of the Roman empire in the west, which took
place towards the close of the fifth century of the christian era;
the second extends to the discovery of America, and of a passage by sea to the
East Indies, about the end of the fifteenth century;
the third extends from the commencement of the sixteenth century
to the present time.

The propriety of the above division is evinced by the nature of
the events which form these epochs. The student will easily[Pg 5]
perceive that the division of history, into that before and after
the birth of Christ, is not judicious.

Commencement
of
political
history.

3. From the definition just given, it follows,
that political history does not commence till after
the first formation of states. Whatever is known,
therefore, of the period previous to this, or may
be gathered from traditions, respecting individuals
or tribes, or their migrations, affinities, or discoveries,
forms no part of political history, but must
be referred to the general history of man.

It is well known that a great deal of information has been preserved
in the sacred writings concerning the early fortunes of
the human race. From these materials have been compiled what
has been called an Historia Antediluviana, sometimes considered
as forming a separate division of history. What has been said
above will satisfactorily account for the omission of this portion
of history in the present work; although none can deny the high
importance of such traditions in the investigation of the origin,
dispersion, and civilization of the human race.

Sources of
history:

4. The sources of history may be ranged under sources of
two general heads; oral traditions, and written documents
of various kinds. The history of every
nation usually commences with oral tradition,
which remains the only source, until the art of
writing becomes known, and in some degree
adopted by the people.

mythology,

5. Under the name of traditional history or mythology,
is comprehended all the general collection
of oral traditions preserved by a nation; and
some such traditional history or mythology is to
be found among every people in the first stage of
their existence as a community. This mythology,
however, is by no means confined to events strictly
historical, but embraces every branch of information
which may appear to a nation in its infancy,[Pg 6]
of sufficient importance to be preserved and handed
down to posterity.

Hence the mythology of a people is invariably composed of
very heterogeneous materials; it not only preserves the remembrance
of various kinds of historical facts, but likewise the pervading
ideas of the people with respect to the nature and worship
of their deities; as well as the notions they had formed from
observations and experience respecting astronomy, morals, the
arts, etc. All these are handed down in the form of historical
narrative; because man, as yet unpractised in abstract thinking,
necessarily represents every thing to his mind under the figure
of some physical object. It is just as useless, therefore, to attempt
to mould the mythology of any people into a consistent
and connected whole, or indeed into any scientific system whatsoever,
as it is difficult to draw a strict line between what belongs
to mythology, and what to pure history. It follows, therefore, that
mythology should be employed by the historian with great caution;
and not without judicious criticism, and an accurate knowledge
of antiquity.

These correct views of mythology,&mdash;the key to the whole of
earlier antiquity,&mdash;were first set forth and illustrated by Heyne,
in his commentaries upon Virgil and other poets, in his edition
of Apollodorus, and in various essays published in the Transactions
of the Gottingen Scientific Society. It is principally to
the aid of these that the Germans owe their superiority over
other nations in the science of antiquity.

poetry,

6. The place of writing among such nations, is
generally supplied, in a great measure, by poetry;
which being in its origin nothing more than imagery
expressed in figurative language, must spontaneously
arise among men, as yet wont to represent
every thing to their minds under the form of
images. Hence the subject matter of the poetry
of every nation, while in a state of rudeness, is
and can be nothing else but its mythology; and
the great variety in the materials of which this is
composed very naturally gave rise, at the same
early period, to various kinds of poetry; as the[Pg 7]
lyric, the didactic, the epic. The last of these,
inasmuch as it contains the historic songs and the
epopee, claims in a more especial manner the attention
of the historian.

The mythi (or fables of which this mythology was composed)
were in later times frequently collected from the works of the
poets, and committed to writing by grammarians; such as Apollodorus
and others. This, however, can have had no effect on
their original character.

written
documents,

7.  The second source of history, much more
copious and important than the former, are the
various kinds of written monuments. These may
be arranged according to the order of time at
which they were brought into use, into three
classes; 1st. Inscriptions on public monuments,
under which head are included the coins of later
date; 2nd. Chronological records of events, under
the form of annals and chronicles; 3rd. Real
philosophical works on history.

inscriptions,

8.  Inscriptions on public monuments erected
to preserve the remembrance of certain events,
though perhaps no more than a stone set upright,
or even a bare rock, was used for that purpose,
were undoubtedly the most ancient written memorials.
These rude monuments became fashioned
by art into columns, obelisks, and pyramids,
as the taste of the nation became formed; and assumed
that definite character which local circumstances
and the natural features of the country
led it to adopt, as architecture arose and attained
to perfection among them. The very object, indeed,
for which they were erected&mdash;the commemoration
of remarkable events,&mdash;must have suggested
the practice of inscribing upon them some
particulars of the facts they were intended to per[Pg 8]petuate.
Of this nature, no doubt, were the oldest
monuments, and more particularly those of
Egypt. Their use was much more general among
nations of a later period, especially Greece and
Rome, than among the moderns; yet of the great
mass of inscriptions still extant, but few comparatively
are of any importance as regards history.

The characters engraved on these monuments were either symbolical
(hieroglyphics; see below under Egypt,) or alphabetical.
The invention and transmission of alphabetical writing are commonly
ascribed to the Ph&#339;nicians; although, if we may judge
by the shape of the arrow-headed character, it was made, without
communication with them, in the interior of Asia.

The general collections of inscriptions are:

Lud. Ant. Muratori, Novus Thesaurus veterum Inscriptionum.
Mediolani, 1739, sq. 4 vols. fol. Together with Seb. Donati,
Supplementa. Lucc&aelig;, 1764. Jan. Gruteri, Inscriptiones
antiqu&aelig; totius orbis Romani, cura J. G. Gr&aelig;vii. Amstel.
1707, 2 vols. fol.

C. A. Boekhius, Corpus Inscriptionum Gr&aelig;carum, auctoritate
et impensis Academi&aelig; literarum Borussic&aelig;, vol. 1. 1827,
folio.

Among the separate monuments, the most important for ancient
history is the Parian or Oxford Inscription, Marmora Oxoniensia,
Arundeliana, edited by Selden, 1629; by Prideaux, 1677.
The best edition is by Rich. Chandler, Oxf. 1763, fol. A
useful and portable edition has been published by Fr. Ch.
Wagner, containing the Greek text, with a German translation
and notes. Gottingen, 1790, 8vo.

coins,

9. Coins may likewise be regarded as a source
of ancient history, as by the light they throw upon
genealogy and chronology, the events known from
other authorities may be better arranged and understood.
The importance of coins, therefore,
becomes most sensible in those portions of history
where our information, in consequence of
[Pg 9]
the loss of the works of the original historians, is
reduced to a few insulated facts and fragments.

Ez. Spanhemii, Dissertatio de Usu et Pr&aelig;stantia Numismatum.
Londini, 1707 et 1709, 2 vols. fol. The capital work, however,
on this subject, and which embraces the whole numismatic
science of antiquity is:

Eckhel, De Doctrina Nummorum Veterum. Vienn&aelig;, 1792&mdash;1798,
8 vols. 4to. And the epitome:

&#8224; Eckhel, Brief Elements of Ancient Numismatics. Vienna,
1707, 8vo. Another very useful work is:

J. C. Rasche, Lexicon Univers&aelig; Rei Nummari&aelig; Veterum.
1785, sq. 5 vols. 8vo.

annals,

10. Chronicles or annals form the second great
division of written historical monuments. These
presuppose the invention of letters, and the use
of materials for writing upon; consequently they
are of a later date than mere inscriptions. They
occur, nevertheless, in the earlier periods of nations;
and from such annals, indited by public
authority (state chronicles,) subsequent historians
have generally drawn materials for their works.
In many nations, and in nearly all the eastern
ones, history has not even yet advanced beyond
the composition of such chronicles.

regular
histories.

11. The third great division of historical writings
is formed of works composed on philosophical
principles, which differ from mere annals by their
containing not only a chronological narration of
events, but also a development of their connection
with one another, their causes and effects.

But few nations among the moderns, and we know of none
among the ancients, except the Greeks and Romans, that had
any acquaintance with this sort of history. A fact which may
be attributed,&mdash;1st. To the government; for the more completely
the affairs of a nation are under the control of arbitrary
power and caprice, whether of one or more individuals, so much the
less apparent is a rational internal connection of events. Hence[Pg 10]
philosophical history flourishes most under free governments;
and has not even a shadow of existence under pure despotic constitutions.
2nd. To the degree of civilization to which the nation
may have attained: for the observing and unravelling of the
political connection of events presupposes a considerable progress
in philosophical culture.

Chronology
and Geography.

12. Since all events are considered in reference
to the time and place in which they occur,
it follows that geography and chronology
are indispensable as auxiliary sciences in the
study of history, especially the ancient. These
sciences, however, need not, for this purpose, be
considered in their full extent and detail, but
only so far as they are of use in determining and
arranging events according to time and place.
A fixed mode of computing time is therefore necessary
in ancient history, as well as a continuous
geographical description of the countries which
were the theatres of the principal events.

Eras.

13. No method of computing time was adopted
generally in antiquity. Each nation, each state,
had its own era: yet, in the explication of ancient
history, there is an evident necessity that
some common era should be fixed upon, by which
a synchronistic view of the various events may be
obtained. For this purpose, the years may be
computed either from the creation of the world,
or before and after Christ. The latter method
has the advantage not only of greater certainty,
but also of greater convenience.

Of the various modes of computing time, the best known are
those of the Greeks and the Romans; the former by olympiads,
the latter by years from the foundation of Rome. The era of
the olympiads commences at B. C. 776; that of the foundation
of Rome commences at B. C. 753, according to Varro; at B. C.
752, according to Cato.&mdash;The era of the Seleucid&aelig;, in the Syrian[Pg 11]
empire, commences with B. C. 312.&mdash;Various other eras, such as
that of Nabonnassar, commencing with B. C. 747, are founded
on observations preserved by Ptolemy, and made known by Scaliger,
in his Doctrina Temporum.

Chronology constitutes a distinct science: the best introduction
to which will be found in:

&#8224; J. C. Gatterer, Epitome of Chronology. Gottingen, 1777.
A most excellent criticism on the ancient eras has lately been
communicated to the public by:

&#8224; L. Ideler, Historic Researches into the Astronomical Observations
of the Ancients. Berlin, 1806.

&#8224; D. H. Hegewisch, Introduction to Historical Chronology;
1811. A very useful and portable work.

[In English we have the laborious work of Dr. Hales:

Hales (Willm.) New Analysis of Chronology, explaining
the History and Antiquities of the primitive Nations of the World,
etc. Lond. 1809-12, 4 vols. 4to. New edition, corrected and improved,
1830, 4 vols. 8vo.

Blair's Chronology and History of the World, from the Creation
to the present Time. Lond. 1803, folio.

And for the brilliant period of Greece and Rome the satisfactory
volumes:

H. F. Clynton's Fasti Hellenici. The civil and literary
Chronology of Greece, from the fifty-fifth to the hundred and
twenty-fourth Olympiad. Second edition, with additions. Oxford,
1827, 4to. And the continuation of the same work to the
death of Augustus, Oxford, 1830, 4to. In this valuable work,
much light is also thrown upon the chronology of the times anterior
to the period with which the first volume is principally
occupied.]

Geography,
mythological
and
true.

14. In ancient geography there is much care
required to distinguish the fabulous from the
true. With regard to true geography, as an
auxiliary science to history, all that can be expected
is some general information respecting the
nature and peculiarities of the countries, respecting
their political divisions, and finally, respecting
the principal cities:&mdash;Long lists of the names
of places would be quite superfluous.

[Pg 12]
Fabulous geography constitutes a part of the mythology of
every nation, and differs in each, because the ideas formed by
every early nation respecting the form and nature of the earth
are peculiar to itself. True geography gradually comes to light
as civilization increases, and discovery widens its horizon.&mdash;Necessity
of treating it historically, on account of the manifold
changes to which the division and the face of the countries of the
ancient world have been at various periods subjected.

15. Ancient history may be treated either ethnographically,
that is, according to separate nations
and states; or synchronistically, that is,
according to certain general epochs. Each of
these methods has its advantages and its disadvantages.
The two, however, may be combined,
and formed into one system; and as this seems
the most convenient, it has been adopted in the[Pg 14]
present work, which is accordingly divided as
follows:

General Preliminary Remarks on the Geography of Asia.

See the Introduction to Heeren's Researches into the Politics
and Commerce of the Nations of Antiquity, prefixed to vol. 1 of
the African Nations. Oxford, 1831.

Extent and
situation.

1. Asia is the largest and the most favourably
situated of the great divisions of the
globe. Its superficial contents are 11,200,000
square geogr. miles; while those of Africa do not
exceed 4,780,000; and those of Europe are
not more than 2,560,000. As to situation, it
comprises the greatest portion of the northern
temperate zone.

Compare it, in this point of view, with the other quarters of
the globe, especially Africa.&mdash;Advantages over the latter, in con[Pg 16]sequence
of the convenience of its indented shores&mdash;of its surrounding
fruitful islands&mdash;of its deep gulfs and large streams&mdash;the
few sandy deserts in its interior.

Natural
features.

2. Natural features, and consequent division of
the land, according to the course of the larger
mountain chains and of the principal rivers.

Two great mountain chains run from west to east; in the
north, the Altai, (nameless in antiquity): in the south, Taurus.&mdash;Branches
of both: the Caucasus, between the Black and Caspian
seas: Imaus extending along the golden desert (desert of
Cobi): the Paropamisus, on the north of India: the Ural (nameless
in antiquity).&mdash;Of the rivers remarkable in ancient history,
there are four flowing from north to south, namely, the Euphrates
and Tigris, which fall into the Persian gulf; the Indus and
Ganges, which fall into the Indian sea: two which run from east
to west, and discharged their waters into the Caspian sea, (but
now into the sea of Aral,) namely, the Oxus (or Jihon) and the
Jaxartes (or Sirr).

Divisions:

3. This quarter of the globe is accordingly
divided into Northern Asia, comprising the regions
north of Altai; Central Asia, or the countries
between the Altai and Taurus; and Southern
Asia, or the lands south of Taurus.

Northern
Asia.

4. Northern Asia, between the 76th and 50th
parallels of north latitude, (Asiatic Russia and
Siberia,) was almost, though not entirely, unknown
in antiquity.&mdash;Some obscure hints, though
partly true, respecting it, are found in Herodotus,
the father of history.

Central
Asia.

5. Central Asia, the regions extending between
the 50th and 40th degrees of north latitude,
Scythia and Sarmatia Asiatica, (Great Tartary
and Mongol;) for the most part a boundless,
barren table land, devoid of arable fields or
forests; and consequently a mere country of[Pg 17]
pasture.&mdash;The inhabitants pastors, (nomads,) without
cities or fixed abodes; recognizing no other
political association than patriarchal government.

Peculiar mode of life and character of nomad nations; powerful
influence which they have exercised, as conquerors, on political
history.&mdash;Whether we have a right to expect that the
civilization of the human race will for ever continue to advance,
when we consider that perhaps one half of it has from time immemorial
remained, and from its physical situation must for ever
remain, in a nomad state.

Southern
Asia.

6. Southern Asia, or the regions from the 40th
degree of N. lat. to about the equator.&mdash;Its natural
features altogether different from those of central
Asia. The great advantages of these regions
compared with all other parts of the earth, in possessing
a soil and climate highly favourable for
agriculture; and an abundance of various costly
productions. To these circumstances may be attributed,
1st. The adoption of fixed habitations
and political associations in these countries, from
the earliest times. 2ndly. Their becoming the
principal seat of trade, from the infancy of civilization
to the discovery of America.

Reflections upon the rise of political associations.&mdash;Whether,
according to the general opinion, they were produced solely by
agriculture and the possession of land; or, whether religion, by
which I mean the common worship of one divinity as the national
god, (communia sacra,) was not the main bond which united the
earliest states of antiquity?&mdash;How shall we account for the very
remarkable fact, that in the earliest civil societies in the world,
the priesthood is generally found to be a ruling caste.&mdash;Reflections
on early trade, particularly that of the east, before it was
changed, by the discovery of America and the new passage to
India, from a land trade to a sea trade.&mdash;Observations upon ancient
commercial routes across Asia.&mdash;The banks of the large
rivers destined by nature to become the seats of commerce for the
interior; on the Oxus, Bactra and Maracanda, (Samarcand;) on[Pg 18]
the Euphrates and Tigris, Babylon.&mdash;The sea shores on the
western coast of Asia Minor and Ph&#339;nicia, pointed out also by
nature as places of commerce;&mdash;line of Grecian and Ph&#339;nician
factories.

7. Division of southern Asia. 1st. South-western
Asia, from the Mediterranean to the Indus;
2nd. South-eastern Asia, from the Indus to
the eastern ocean.

A. South-western Asia is again subdivided into
the countries&mdash;1st. on this side the Euphrates&mdash;2ndly.
between the Euphrates and Tigris&mdash;3rdly.
between the Tigris and the Indus.

1. Countries on this side the Euphrates.

Asia Minor.

(a) The peninsula of Asia Minor (Natolia).
Principal rivers: the Halys and Sangarius. Countries:
three towards the west, Mysia, Lydia,
Caria. Along the shore, the Greek seaports of
Phoc&aelig;a, Ephesus, Miletus, Smyrna, Halicarnassus,
etc. Inland, the cities of Sardes in Lydia,
of Pergamus in Mysia.

Three towards the south, Lycia, Pamphylia,
and Cilicia, with its capital Tarsus.

Three towards the north, Bithynia, Paphlagonia,
Pontus; with the Greek ports of Heraclea,
Amisus, and Sinope. Two inland, Phrygia, together
with Galatia and the capital cities of Gordium
and Cel&aelig;n&aelig;; Cappadocia, with the city of
Mazaca.

Islands.

(b) Islands along the coast of Asia Minor: Lesbos,
with the city of Mitylene; Chios, Samos,
Cos, Rhodes, with cities of the same name.

Syria.
Ph&#339;nicia.
Palestine.

(c) Syria, together with Ph&#339;nicia and Palestine. 1st. Syria, properly so called. Cities: Damascus,
Emessa, Heliopolis, (Baalbec). In the desert, Palmyra. 2nd. Ph&#339;nicia, a mountainous
[Pg 19]
tract, extending along the shore. Mountains: Libanus and Antilibanus. Cities: Tyre, on an
island opposite the ancient Tyre, which was situate upon the mainland; Sidon, Byblus, Berytus,
Tripolis, Aradus.
3rd. Palestine. Mountains: Carmel, Tabor. River: Jordan, which discharges
its waters into the Dead sea. Division of Palestine; first, according to
the twelve tribes; afterwards into the provinces, of Jud&aelig;a, capital
Jerusalem: of Samaria; cities, Samaria, Sichem: and of Galilee.

Arabia.

(d) Peninsula of Arabia, abounding in vast sandy
deserts, and almost entirely occupied by nomad
tribes. Its southern and eastern coasts render it,
nevertheless, a most important seat of trade. In
the north, Arabia Petr&aelig;a, so called from the town
of Petra. Inland, Arabia Deserta. In the south,
Arabia Felix; rich, both in natural productions,
being the native land of almost every kind of perfume,
particularly frankincense; and also as being
the ancient staple for the merchandise of India.
Cities: Mariaba, Aden, etc. In the east,
the trading town of Gerra, and the islands near
the shore, Tylos and Aradus, (Bahrein,) both likewise
marts for Arabian and Indian wares, particularly
cinnamon from Taprobane (Ceylon).

2. Countries between the Euphrates and Tigris.

Mesopotamia.

(a) Mesopotamia; in the interior a sterile table
land, entirely occupied by nomad hordes. Cities
on the Euphrates: Thapsacus, Circesium, Cunaxa;
in the north, Zoba or Nisibis.

Armenia.

(b) Armenia, north of the foregoing. Very
mountainous; for a long time without cities, but
at last it had Tigranocerta. Rivers: the Cyrus[Pg 20]
and Araxes, falling into the Caspian; and the
Phasis, falling into the Black sea.

Babylonia.

(c) Babylonia, the southern part of Mesopotamia,
from which it was separated by the Median
wall. A level plain, remarkable for the richness
of its soil; formerly, by its high cultivation, its
canals and lakes, and the erection of dams, the
most fruitful, and, from its situation, the most
opulent staple of inner Asia. Cities: Babylon
on the Euphrates, Borsippa.

Whether the account given by Herodotus, as an eyewitness, of
the size and splendour of Babylon is not exaggerated?&mdash;Manner
in which the great Asiatic cities arose out of the royal encampments
of the nomad conquerors.

3. Countries between the Tigris and the Indus.

Assyria.

(a) Assyria, or the province of Adiabene; a table
land. Cities: Nineveh, (Ninus,) Arbela.

The name of Assyria is also frequently taken by the Greeks
in a wider acceptation, as comprising both Mesopotamia and Babylonia;
it is sometimes even confounded with Syria.

Susiana.

(b) Susiana, a fruitful district, with the city
Susa on the river Choaspes, or Eul&aelig;us (Ulai),
one of the residences of the Persian monarchs.

Persia.

(c) Persis, rugged and mountainous towards
the north; level and fruitful in the centre; sandy
towards the south. Rivers: the Cyrus and
Araxes. Cities: Persepolis or Pasargada, the
national palace and cemetery of the kings of
Persia.

The name of Persis was, in ancient as well as in modern geography,
taken in a more extensive sense, as comprising all the
countries between the Tigris and Indus, with the exception of
Assyria. In this sense, it contains three countries towards the
south&mdash;Persis, properly so called; Carmania, Gedrosia: three[Pg 21]
central countries&mdash;Media, Aria, Arachosia: and three countries
towards the north&mdash;Parthia and Hyrcania, Bactria, Sogdiana.

Carmania.

(d) Carmania, an extensive country, for the
most part desert, ranging along the Persian gulf
and Indian sea. Cities: Carmana, Harmozia.

Gedrosia.

(e) Gedrosia, tract of land running along the
coast between Carmania and India, and washed
by the Indian sea. A mere sandy desert; towards
the north, mountainous. Town, Pura.

Media.

(f) Media, above Persis; an extensive and very
fruitful country; mountainous towards the north.
Rivers: Araxes, Cyrus, and Mardus. Cities:
Ecbatana, Rages. The northern district was
likewise known by the name of Atropatene (Azerbeijan),
or Lesser Media.

Aria.

(g) Aria, a smooth table land, with a lake and
river, Arius: and one city, Aria or Artacoana.

Arachosia.

(h) Arachosia; a rich and fertile country on the
frontiers of India; bounded towards the north by
the Paropamisus chain. Cities: Arachotus and
Prophthasia. The neighbouring highlands, occupied
by a numerous population, (now Cabul and
Kandahar,) are often regarded, in consequence of
their being subject to the Persian dominion, as
forming part of Persia. They are known by the
name of Paropamisus.

Parthia.

(i) Parthia and Hyrcania, rugged mountainous
districts to the north of Media; but abounding in
magnificent and fertile vales. Before and during
the predominance of Persia, but little known and
little valued; and without cities. It was at a
considerably later period that the inhabitants of
Parthia became a dominant nation.

Bactria.

(k) Bactria, the country on the south bank of
[Pg 22]
the Oxus; rich in natural productions, and one of
the most ancient marts of Asia. River: Oxus.
Cities: Bactra and Zariaspa.

Bactria lies on the frontier of India, Little Thibet, Bukharia,
(the north India of Herodotus and Ctesias,) and the desert of
Cobi, (Herodotus's golden desert): the road to China runs
through this country. Nature, by the geographical situation in
which she has placed Bactria, seems to have destined it to be the
great emporium for the wares of south-eastern Asia; and in proportion
as we penetrate into early history, we become convinced
that Bactria, like Babylon, must have been one of the earliest
seats of international commerce, and consequently, if not the
birthplace, one of the cradles of infant civilization.

Sogdiana.

(l) Sogdiana, the territory between the upper
Oxus and upper Jaxartes, the latter dividing it
from central Asia. (A part of Great Bukharia.)
Its peculiarities and advantages similar to those
of the neighbouring Bactria. Capital: Maracanda
(Samarcand).

B. South-eastern Asia, or Asia beyond the
Indus, offers nothing remarkable for history till a
later period. See Book v, Period iv.





General Preliminary Observations upon the History and
Constitution of the great Asiatic Empires.


Magnitude
of the empires
in
Asia.

1. Asia contained in ancient times, as it does
at present, empires of immense extent, differing
materially both in this respect and in their constitution
from the civilized nations of Europe.
Changes were frequent; but the form of government
continued nearly always the same. Some
deeply rooted and active principles therefore must[Pg 23]
have been in constant operation, to have given so
repeatedly, in these various revolutions, the same
organization to the kingdoms of Asia.

Nature of
their revolutions.

2. The great revolutions of Asia, with the exception
of that caused by Alexander, were effected
by the numerous and powerful nomad races
which inhabited a large portion of that continent.
Pressed by necessity or circumstances, they forsook
their own seats, founded new kingdoms, and
carried war and conquest into the fruitful and cultivated
lands of southern Asia, until, enervated
by luxury, the consequence of the change in their
mode of life, they were in their turn, and in a
similar manner, subjugated.

Their short
existence.

3. This origin, common to all Asiatic kingdoms,
accounts for their immense extent, their rapid
establishment, and their generally brief duration.

Similarity
in their
constitutions.

4. The internal organization must, for the same
reasons, have been nearly alike in all; and the
constant reappearance of despotism is accounted
for, partly by the rights of conquest, partly by
the vast extent of the subdued countries, which
obliged the rulers to have recourse to satrap-government.

Effects of
polygamy.

5. To this, it must moreover be added, that
among all the considerable nations of inner Asia,
the paternal government of every household was
corrupted by polygamy: where that custom exists,
a good political constitution is impossible;
fathers being converted into domestic despots,
are ready to pay the same abject obedience to
their sovereign that they exact from their family
and dependants in their domestic economy.

[Pg 24]

To avoid confusion, it will be necessary to define the terms
despotism and despotic government. In theory, we must admit
THREE essentially different kinds of government. 1st. The despotic,
in which the members of the state are not secured in the
possession of their rights as men, (personal freedom and security
of property,) nor of their rights as citizens, (active participation
in the legislative power). Such a constitution exists only by
force, and can never be lawful. 2nd. The autocratic, in which
the members of the state are in full possession of their rights as
men, but not of their rights as citizens. This government, therefore,
arises from the union of the legislative and executive powers
in the person of the ruler. In form, it is either monarchical or
aristocratical (a pure monarchy, or a pure aristocracy). This kind
of government is most likely to be established by usurpation; it
may, nevertheless, be acquired by succession, or even adopted by
common consent: it may therefore be lawful. 3rd. The republican,
in which the members of the state are in possession of their
rights, both as men and as citizens. This government necessarily
presupposes a separation of the legislative and executive powers;
and with regard to its form, may be either monarchical or aristocratical,
(a moderate monarchy, or a moderate aristocracy).&mdash;How
far can a pure democracy be called a government, and comprised
under any of the foregoing heads?&mdash;Explanation of the
despotism in the Asiatic kingdoms, and the attempts made to
limit it by religion and religious institutions.

Rise, progress,
and
fall of nomad
empires.

6. General features in the gradual internal development
of all empires formed by nomad conquerors.
(a) At first the mere occupation of rich
territories, and levying of tribute. (b) Hence the
constitutions already established among the conquered
or tributary nations generally suffered to
remain. (c) Gradual progress towards the adoption
of a fixed abode and the building of cities, together
with the assumption of the customs and
civilization of the conquered. (d) Division into
provinces, and, as a necessary consequence, the
establishment of satrap-government. (e) Insurrections
of the satraps, and the internal ruin of
the state prepared thereby. (f) The influence[Pg 25]
of the seraglio on the government has the same
effect, for its unavoidable consequences are&mdash;effeminacy
and indolence in the rulers. (g) Hence
the dissolution of the empire, or its total annihilation
by some violent attack from without.



Fragments of the History of the ancient Asiatic Kingdoms
previous to Cyrus.

Sources, and their critical examination: 1. Jewish writings,
particularly the books of Kings, Chroniclers, and the Prophets;
together with the Mosaic records. 2. Greek writers, Herodotus,
Ctesias, and Diodorus: later chroniclers, Syncellus, Eusebius,
Ptolemy. 3. Native writer, Berosus. Futility of all endeavours
to arrange into one work the accounts of authors so entirely different
by birth and the times in which they flourished: a task
attempted by the French writers, Sevin, Freret, and Debrosse,
in their papers contained in the M&eacute;m. de l'Acad. des
Inscript.

Volney, Recherches nouvelles sur l'Histoire ancienne. 1808&mdash;1814:
very important and authentic, so far as regards the
system of Herodotus's chronology.


I. Assyrian monarchy.

Assyrians
of the
Greeks different
from
those of the
Hebrews.

1. With the Greeks, Assyrian is generally a
common name applied to the ruling nations about
the Euphrates and Tigris before the time of Cyrus.
With the Jews, on the contrary, it signifies
a distinct nation of conquerors, and the founders
of an empire. Hence a necessary discrepancy
between the Grecian and Hebrew statements.

Grecian
account.

2. Assyrian history, according to Grecian authorities,
particularly Ctesias and Diodorus, is nothing
more than mere traditions of ancient heroes
and heroines, who at some early period founded
a large kingdom in the countries about the Eu[Pg 26]phrates
and Tigris; traditions without any chronological
data, and in the style of the east. Ninus&mdash;Semiramis&mdash;Ninyas&mdash;Sardanapalus.

According to Herodotus, an Assyrian empire of 520 years'
duration, 1237&mdash;717. Lists of Assyrian kings in the chronicles
of Syncellus and Eusebius.

Jewish account.

3. Assyrian history, according to Jewish authorities.
Chronological history of an Assyrian empire
between B. C. 800 and 700.&mdash;Seat of the
nation in Assyria, properly so called.&mdash;Capital:
Nineveh on the Tigris.&mdash;Extension of their dominion
as far as Syria and Ph&#339;nicia.

Line of Assyrian kings: 1. Pul, about 773. Invasion of Syria.
2. Tiglath-Pileser, about 740. He overthrows the kingdom
of Damascus. 3. Shalmaneser, about 720. He destroys the kingdom
of Samaria. Transplantation of the inhabitants into inner
Asia. 4. Sennacherib, about 714. Mighty expedition against
Egypt, frustrated by a pestilence. 5. Esarhaddon.

Contemporary: Jews, the divided kingdoms of Israel and
Judah.&mdash;Greeks, decennial archons at Athens.&mdash;Romans, rise
of the state and the two first kings.


II. Median monarchy.

Different
acceptations
of the
word
Medes.

1. The name of Medes is undoubtedly often
used by the Greeks to designate one nation; it is,
however, frequently made use of as a common
appellation of the ruling nations in eastern Asia,
from the Tigris to the Indus, (or Persia, in the
more extensive sense of that word,) before Cyrus.&mdash;With
the Jews: nothing more than general
hints of the Medes as a conquering nation.

Great nations
known
to have existed
east of
the Tigris.

2. Although the statements of the Grecian
writers, as well as of the Zendavesta, sufficiently
prove that long before the rise of the Persian
power mighty kingdoms existed in these regions;
and particularly in the eastern part, or Bactria;[Pg 27]
yet we have no consistent or chronological history
of these states: nothing but a few fragments,
probably of dynasties which ruled in Media, properly
so called, immediately previous to the Persians.

a. Herodotus's History of the Medes. Herodotus's Medes are
unquestionably the inhabitants of Media, properly so called.
Division into six tribes: among these, that of the Magi.&mdash;Ruling
nation after the overthrow of the Assyrians.&mdash;Capital of their
empire, Ecbatana.&mdash;Boundaries: west, the Tigris and Halys;
east, unknown.&mdash;Internal organization: graduated subjection of
the various nations to one another, according to their distance
from the seat of empire; rigid despotism; and imposition of tribute.
Line of kings between B. C. 717&mdash;560. Deioces, 53 y.
the founder of Ecbatana, d. 657.&mdash;Phraortes, 22 y. down to 635.
He conquers Persia. Cyaxares I. 40 y. down to 595. He establishes
military discipline among the Medes. Wages war with
the Lydians, the Assyrians.&mdash;Irruption of the Scythians and
Cimmerians, 625.&mdash;He takes Nineveh, 597. Astyages, 38 y.
down to 560, when he was dethroned by Cyrus. According to
Xenophon, Astyages was followed by another Median prince,
Cyaxares II. b. Ctesias's History of the Medes, deduced from
Persian archives, and contained in Diodorus. Probably a different
dynasty in eastern Asia. Line of kings, between B. C. 800
and 560. Arbaces, conqueror of the Assyrians, 18 y. Mandaucus,
50 y. Sosarmes, 30 y. Artias, 50 y. Arbanes, 22 y.
Art&aelig;us, 40 y. and Artynes, 22 y. Sanguinary wars with the
nomad races of the east, the Sac&aelig;, and Cadusii. Artibarnas, 14 y.
Astyages, the last king.

Contemporary: Jews, kingdom of Judah alone.&mdash;Greeks,
yearly archons, Draco, Solon.&mdash;Romans, kings from Tullus Hostilius
to Servius Tullius.


III. Babylonian monarchy.

Babylonians.

Periods: 1st. Previous to the Chald&aelig;an conquest,
which occurred about 630. 2nd. From the
Chald&aelig;an conquest to the Persian, 630&mdash;538.

1st period,
to B. C. 630.
fragments.

1. Babylon was not only spoken of in the most
remote antiquity, but is mentioned in the Jewish[Pg 28]
traditions as the earliest scene of political treaties,
and as the most ancient seat of intercourse
for the nations of Asia. Traditions concerning
Nimrod&mdash;and the erection of the tower of Babel.&mdash;Comparison
of those traditions with the Babylonian
mythology in Berosus.&mdash;Scanty historical
notices of this period in the later Jewish writers;
and probable subjection of Babylon to the Assyrian
empire.

2nd period, to 538.

Chald&aelig;ans.

2. In the second period, 630&mdash;538, the Babylonians
were the ruling nation of western Asia.&mdash;The
Chald&aelig;ans take possession of Babylon,
there establish themselves, and ultimately extend
their empire, by conquest, to the Mediterranean.

Origin of the Chald&aelig;ans: whether that name was applied to
a distinct nation, or to the northern nomads in general?&mdash;Line of
Chald&aelig;an kings. In the enumeration of these rulers, as given
by Ptolemy, this line begins with Nabonassar, and the era bearing
the name of that sovereign, which commences in the year
B. C. 747: (probably because, under the reign of that prince, the
adoption of the Egyptian solar year first introduced among the
Chald&aelig;ans an exact method of reckoning time). Neither Nabonassar
himself, nor his twelve immediate successors, are remarkable
in history: the six last alone deserve notice. 1. Nabopolassar,
627&mdash;604. Settlement in Babylon; and complete establishment
of the Chald&aelig;o-Babylonian dominion, by his victory
over Pharaoh-Nechoh, near Circesium, in 604. 2. Nebuchadnezzar,
604&mdash;561. Brilliant period of the Chald&aelig;o-Babylonian
empire. He conquers Ph&#339;nicia and Old Tyre about 586: Jerusalem
in 587; probable irruptions into Egypt. Construction
of immense buildings and canals in and about Babylon. Rapid
decline of the empire after his death, under&mdash;3. Evil-Merodach,
561&mdash;559. 4. Neriglissar, (probably the contemporary of Herodotus's
Nitocris;)&mdash;555. Labosoarchad murdered, after a few
months' reign. Nabonadius, (Herodotus's Labynetus; and probably
the Chald&aelig;an Belshazzar;) 555&mdash;538. attacked and conquered
by Cyrus. Sack of Babylon by the Persians, 538.

IV. States and kingdoms in Asia Minor.

No lasting
empire
formed in
Asia Minor.

The number and variety of the inhabitants of
this peninsula, was probably the reason why they
never became united into one empire. The most
important nations among them, were the Carians
in the west; the Phrygians in the centre, reaching
as far as the Halys; the Syro-Cappadocians
beyond the Halys; and the Thracians in Bithynia.
Nevertheless we find here but three kingdoms
deserving notice&mdash;the Trojan, the Phrygian, and
the Lydian.

Troy.

1. The Trojan empire comprised western Mysia:
its history consists of mere traditions contained
in poets, with very uncertain chronological
data.

Kings: Teucer, about 1400.&mdash;Dardanus&mdash;Erichthonius&mdash;Tros
(Troja)&mdash;Ilus (Ilium)&mdash;Laomedon&mdash;Priam. The destruction of
Troy, after a ten years' war, occurred, it is probable, B. C. 1190.

Contemporary: Jews, time of the Judges: before the foundation
of Rome, 450 years.

Phrygia.

2. The Phrygian empire.&mdash;Almost all the kings
were named Midas and Gordius; their succession
cannot be accurately determined. After the death
of the last, called Midas V., Phrygia became a
province of the Lydian empire, about 560.

Lydia:
three dynasties there.

3. The Lydian empire.&mdash;The Lydians (M&aelig;onians)
were a branch of the Carian tribe. According
to Herodotus, three dynasties ruled in Lydia;
the Atyad&aelig; down to 1232; the Heraclid&aelig; down
to 727; and the Mermnad&aelig; down to 557: the[Pg 30]
two first are almost wholly fabulous, and the proper
history of Lydia may be said to commence
with the last dynasty.

Kings: Gyges, down to 689. From this period followed almost
uninterrupted wars with the Greek settlements on the seacoast.
Gyges takes Colophon. Ardys down to 640. He takes
Priene. Under his reign, an irruption of the Cimmerians. Sadyattes
down to 628. Alyattes down to 571. Expulsion of the
Cimmerians. Capture of Smyrna. Cr&#339;sus down to 557. He
takes Ephesus, and subjugates Asia Minor as far as the Halys.
Under his reign, the first rise of a Lydian empire, which however
is overthrown by Cyrus. Asia Minor becomes a province
of the Persian empire.

Contemporary with which, in Asia, were the Medic and Babylonian
empires.&mdash;Among the Jews, the last period of the kingdom
of Judah.&mdash;Among the Greeks, the yearly archons at Athens.&mdash;With
the Romans, the kings.


V. Ph&#339;nicia.

Fragments
of Ph&#339;nician
history.

The Ph&#339;nicians may be regarded as one of the
most remarkable nations of Asia during this period;
yet we have no complete, or even connected
history of this people. But though a few scattered
fragments are all we possess, we may from
these trace out a general outline.

The peculiar sources of Ph&#339;nician history.&mdash;How far Sanchoniathon
deserves to be mentioned here?&mdash;Hebrew writers, particularly
Ezekiel; Greek writers; Josephus&mdash;Eusebius, etc. and
the fragments which he has preserved of Menander of Ephesus,
and Dius, historians of Tyre.

Mignot, M&eacute;moires sur les Ph&eacute;niciens; inserted in M&eacute;m. de
l'Acad. des Inscript. t. xxxiv&mdash;xlii. A series of twenty-four
papers.

The section concerning the Ph&#339;nicians in A. H. L. Heeren's
Researches on the Politics, etc.

Ph&#339;nician
federation
of cities.

1. Observations on the internal state of Ph&#339;nicia.
It did not constitute one state, or, at least,
one single empire; but consisted of several, and[Pg 31]
their territories.  Alliances, however, were naturally
formed between them, and hence a kind
of supremacy of the more powerful, particularly of
Tyre.

Each city
independent,
but
Tyre the
first.

2.  But though Tyre stood at the head, and
claimed a certain degree of superiority, each separate state still
possessed its own particular government. In all of them we meet with
kings, who appear to have possessed but a limited authority, as we
always find magistrates associated with them in power. Among a
mercantile and colonizing people, it was impossible that absolute
despotism should endure for any length of time. Of the separate states,
Tyre is the only one of which we possess
a series of kings;
Tyrian kings.
and even that series is not complete.

This line of kings, which we derive from Menander through
Josephus, commences with Abical, the contemporary of David,
about B. C. 1050. The most remarkable among them are: Hiram,
the successor of Abical;&mdash;Ethbaal I. about 920;&mdash;Pygmalion,
Dido's brother, about 900;&mdash;Ethbaal II. in whose reign
Tyre was sacked by Nebuchadnezzar, 586.&mdash;Foundation of New
Tyre&mdash;republican constitution under suffetes: tributary kings
under the Persian rule;&mdash;conquest of New Tyre by Alexander,
332. The flourishing period of Ph&#339;nicia in general, and of
Tyre in particular, falls therefore between 1000&mdash;332.

Contemporary in inner Asia: monarchies of the Assyrians,
Medes, and the Babylonians. Jews: period of the kings after
David. Greeks: from Homer to Solon. Romans: period of
their kings in the last two centuries.

Ph&#339;nician
colonies:

3.  During this period the Ph&#339;nicians spread
themselves by the establishment of colonies; some
of which, particularly Carthage, became as powerful
as the mother states.

General ideas concerning colonization.&mdash;1. Colonies are absolutely
necessary to every seafaring and commercial people,[Pg 32]
whenever their trade extends to distant countries. 2. They have
likewise been established for the purpose of providing for the excessive
increase of the poor. 3. And they have sometimes arisen
from political commotion, when the malcontents, either from
free will, or force, have forsaken their country, and sought new
settlements in distant regions.

in the islands;
Spain;
Africa;
Sicily;
probably in the Persian gulf.

4. Geographical sketch of the Ph&#339;nician colonies.
They possessed, at a very early period,
most of the islands of the Archipelago; from
which, however, they were subsequently expelled
by the Greeks. The principal countries in which
they had settlements were the south of
Spain (Tartessus, Gades, Carteia); the north coast of
Africa, west of the Lesser Syrtis (Utica, Carthage,
Adrumetum); and the north-western coast of
Sicily (Panormus, Lilyb&aelig;um). It is likewise
highly probable that they formed settlements towards
the east in the Persian gulf, on the islands
of Tylos and Aradus (Bahrein).

Sea trade of
the Ph&#339;nicians:

5. This sketch of the Ph&#339;nician colonies will
give us some idea of the extent of their sea trade
and navigation; which, however, extended much
farther than their colonies. Among them, as
among other nations, commerce took its rise in
piracy; even as late as the time of Homer, the
Ph&#339;nicians appear to have been freebooters. The
principal objects of their commerce were (a) the
settlements in north Africa and Spain; the latter
more particularly, on account of its rich silver
mines. (b) Beyond the Pillars of Hercules, the
west-coast of Africa; Britain and the Scilly islands,
for the purpose of procuring tin, and, very
probably, amber. (c) From Elath and Ezion-Gebar,
ports situate at the northern extremity of the
Arabian gulph, they undertook, in connection with
[Pg 33]
the Jews, voyages to Ophir, that is to say, to the
rich lands of the south, particularly Arabia Felix
and Ethiopia. (d) From the Persian gulf, they
extended their commerce to the western peninsula
of India and the island of Ceylon. Finally, (e)
they double  the cape of Good Hope.
they made several extensive voyages of discovery,
among which, the most remarkable was the circumnavigation
of Africa.

Their land
trade:

6. Of no less importance was the land trade,
mostly carried on by caravans. The principal
branches of it were: (a) The Arabian caravan
trade for spices and incense, imported from Arabia
Felix, Gerra, and the Persian gulf. (b) The
trade through Palmyra with Babylon, which
opened them an indirect communication by way
of Persia, with lesser Bukharia and little Thibet,
probably even with China itself. (c) The trade
with Armenia and the neighbouring countries in
slaves, horses, copper utensils, etc.

their manufactures.

7. To all this must be added their own manufactures,
particularly their stuffs and dyes; (the
purple, made of the juice of a marine shellfish;)
their manufactures of glass and toys, which, in
their commerce with uncivilized nations, generally
carried on by barter, were turned to good account.
Many other important discoveries, among which
the invention of letters holds the first rank, are
attributed to the Ph&#339;nicians.


VI. Syrians.

Syria, an
early state;

1. The inhabitants of Syria dwelt in cities as
early as B. C. 2000, when Abraham wandered
over their country. This country did not form
one single state, but consisted of several cities,
each of which had its separate territory, and its[Pg 34]
chief or king; of these cities, Damascus, Hamath,
etc. are mentioned in the most remote antiquity.

a frequent
object of
conquest:
about 1040.

2. The Syrians were, however, often subjected
by foreign conquerors; and their country was certainly,
at least in the time of David, a Jewish province.
It shook off the yoke, however, in the
time of Solomon; when Rezon, who had formerly
been a slave, obtained possession of Damascus.

Kingdom of
Damascus.

3. After this, there arose the kingdom of Damascus,
which comprised the greatest portion of
Syria, the kings in the other cities becoming tributary
to Damascus. The boundaries of the empire,
too, were extended, and particularly at the
expense of the divided kingdoms of Judah and
Israel.

The kings, whose names are taken from the books of Chronicles,
were: Rezon, about 980. Benhadad I. about 900. Hazael,
about 850. Benhadad II. about 830. Rezin. Under this last,
the kingdom of Damascus was overthrown by the Assyrian conqueror
Tiglath-Pileser, about 740.

Contemporary in Inner Asia: Assyrian kingdom. Jews:
kingdoms of Israel and Judah. Greeks: settlement of the Asiatic
colonies.&mdash;Lycurgus.


VII. Jews.

Periods of
Jewish history.

The history of the Jewish people, begins with
Abraham the father of their race; that of the
Jewish state does not commence till after the conquest
of Palestine. It is divided into three periods.
I. History of the Jews, as a nomad horde,
from Abraham till their settlement in Palestine,
B. C. 2000&mdash;1500. II. History of the Jewish
state as a federative republic under the high
priests and judges, from B. C. 1500&mdash;1100. III.
History of the Jewish state under a monarchical
government, from B. C. 1100&mdash;600, first in one[Pg 35]
kingdom,&mdash;975; afterwards as two separate kingdoms,
Israel and Judah, until the downfall of the
latter, 588.

Sources of the Jewish history.&mdash;Their annals:&mdash;Books of
Judges, Samuel, Chronicles, Kings. How those books were composed,
and whether their authors may be considered as contemporary
with the events they relate? How far the Hebrew poets,
the prophets in particular, may be considered as historical authority?&mdash;Josephus,
as an antiquarian in his Arch&aelig;ologia, and as a
contemporary historian in his Historia Belli Romani.

Unfortunately there is not at present any satisfactory treatise
on the Jewish history previous to the Babylonian captivity; nor
one written in an impartial spirit, without credulity or scepticism.
The work of Berruyer, Histoire du Peuple de Dieu, depuis
son origine jusqu'&agrave; la Naissance de J. C. Paris, 1742, 10 vols.
8vo.; and the continuation, depuis la Naissance de J. C. 10
vols.; and others of the same kind do not answer this description.
Relandi Antiquit. Sacr. Heb. The writings of J. D. Michaelis,
particularly his &#8224; Remarks on the Translation of the Old
Testament, and his &#8224; Mosaic Law; together with &#8224; Herder,
On the Spirit of Hebrew Poesy, furnish many excellent materials.


Jews as a nomad horde:
sojourn in Egypt 2000 to about 1500.

I. Period of the nomad state from Abraham to the conquest of
Palestine.&mdash;Under Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, nothing more
at first than a single nomad family; which, however, during its
sojourn in Lower Egypt,
where, during four hundred and thirty, or, according to others, two hundred and
fifty years, it roved about in subjection to the Egyptian Pharaohs,&mdash;increased
to a nomad nation, divided into twelve tribes.  The nation,
however, becoming formidable from the great increase
of its numbers, the Pharaohs, following the
usual policy of the Egyptians, wished to compel
the Jews to build and inhabit cities. Unaccustomed
to restraint, they fled from Egypt under
the conduct of Moses; and conquered, under him
[Pg 36]
and his successor Joshua, Palestine, the land of
promise.

Moses and his legislation.&mdash;What he borrowed and what he
did not borrow from the Egyptians?&mdash;The worship of Jehovah
in the national sanctuary, and by national festivals, celebrated
with ceremonies rigidly prescribed, the point of union for the
whole nation, and the political bond which held the tribes together.&mdash;The
caste of Levites, compared with the Egyptian caste
of priests.

J. D. Michaelis, Mosaic Law. Gottingen, 1778, etc. 6 vols.
8vo.; translated into English by Dr. Alexander Smith.
Lond. 1814, 4 vols. 8vo. The commentator frequently sees more
than the lawgiver.


Jews as a
federate republic.

II. Period of the federative republic. From the
occupation of Palestine to the establishment of
monarchy, 1500&mdash;1100.

Heroic age.

1. General character of this period as the heroic
age of the nation, which, after the gradual
adoption of fixed dwellings and agriculture, was
engaged in constant feuds with its neighbours, the
vagrant Arabs, the Philistines, and the Edomites.
Impossibility of exterminating entirely the ancient
inhabitants according to the intention of Moses.&mdash;Hence
the worship of Jehovah was never the only
religion in the land.

Constitution.

2. Political organization. In consequence of
the division of land, according to tribes, and their
separation from one another, the government long
remained patriarchal. Each tribe preserved its
patriarch or elder, as in the nomad state. All,
however, had, in the worship of Jehovah, one
common bond, uniting them into one federate
state. Magistrates were likewise appointed in
the cities, to whom scribes are conjoined out of
the Levite caste.[Pg 37]

Distribution
of the
Levites.

3. The permanent union of the nation, and preservation
of the Mosaic law, were likewise promoted
by the distribution of the Levite caste into
forty-eight separate towns, situated in various
parts of the country, and by making the high
priesthood hereditary in Aaron's family.

Disturbed
state of the
Jews at the
death of
Joshua.

4. But when at the death of Joshua the people
were left without a common ruler, the tie of religion
became insufficient to hold them together;
especially as the weaker tribes became jealous of
the more powerful. At this time the high priests
appear to have had but little political influence;
and the national bond was only prevented from
being dissolved by the dread of a foreign yoke.

Judges.

5. The Jews were sometimes independent, at
other times tributary. In seasons of oppression
and distress heroes arose, jealous for the worship
of Jehovah, to deliver them from bondage. They
acted as chief magistrates and rulers of a part, or
even the whole of the nation, and as champions
of the worship of the true God. The judges, particularly
Othniel, Deborah, and Sampson.&mdash;Concerning
the marvellous in their history.

Kings,
about 1150.

6. Reestablishment of the worship of Jehovah
by Samuel. He becomes judge, and rules as
Jehovah's minister.&mdash;His scheme of making the
office of judge hereditary in his own family is
defeated by the conduct of his sons. The nation
demands a king, whom Samuel, as minister
of Jehovah, is called upon to appoint. His crafty
policy in the election, which he cannot impede.
He chooses Saul, politically speaking, the most
insignificant man of the nation; but the tallest
and most stately. A formal constitutional act,[Pg 38]
according to the Mosaic command, is drawn up
and deposited in the national sanctuary.

Causes which led the nation to demand a king.&mdash;Earlier attempts
made, particularly by Abimelech, to obtain regal power.


III. Period of the monarchy from 1100&mdash;600.

I. The Jewish state as one single kingdom from
1100 (1095)&mdash;975.

Saul:

1. Saul, the new king, strengthened himself on
the throne by a victory over the Ammonites; and
a general assembly of the nation, in which Samuel
laid down his office as judge, unanimously acknowledged
his sovereignty. But Saul, no sooner
became a conqueror than he threw off the tutelage
of Samuel, and ventured himself to consult Jehovah.
This was the occasion of a feud between
them. Samuel, offended, privately anointed another
young man, David the son of Jesse, as king.
David acquires fame and popularity by his heroic
conduct; but has much difficulty in escaping the
jealousy of Saul.&mdash;Saul sustains himself amid
constant wars with the neighbouring nations;
slain about 1055.
but at last defeated, he and all his sons, except
one, lose their lives.

Jewish government
and state
under him.

2. State of the nation and constitution under
Saul.&mdash;The king little more than a military leader
under the direction of Jehovah; without either
court or fixed residence.&mdash;The people still a mere
agricultural and pastoral race, without wealth or
luxury; but gradually assuming the character of
a warlike nation.

David,
1055&mdash;1015.

3. Saul was succeeded by David; but not
without opposition. Eleven tribes declare for[Pg 39]
Ish-bosheth, the remaining son of Saul; and David
is only acknowledged by his own tribe, Judah.
It is not till seven years later, and the murder of
Ish-bosheth by his own people, that David is recognized
as king by the whole nation.

State of the
nation and
government
in his reign.

4. Complete formation of the nation, and a
change of constitution during the reign of David
over the united kingdom, which lasted thirty-three
years. Jerusalem is made the seat of government
and of the national sanctuary. Rigid observance
of the worship of Jehovah, the exclusive religion
of the nation, considered in respect to its political
consequence.

Conquests.

5. Vast aggrandizement of the Jewish state by
conquest. A war with Hadadezer opens the way
to the conquest of Syria and Idum&aelig;a. Extent of
the kingdom from the Euphrates to the Mediterranean;
from Ph&#339;nicia to the Red sea. Gradual
decline towards despotism and seraglio government;
the political consequences of which
become apparent about the end of David's reign,
in the rebellion of his sons.

Solomon,
1015&mdash;975.

6. Reign of Solomon. The brilliant government
of a despot from the interior of his seraglio;
unwarlike, but civilized, and fond of parade. New
organization of the kingdom for the support of
the court. Connections formed with the neighbouring
states, particularly with Tyre; hence a
participation in the southern trade carried on from
the ports of the Red sea, conquered by David;
but only as a monopoly of the court.

Declension
of the state.

7. The capital enriched by the splendour of the
court; but the country oppressed and impoverished,
particularly the distant tribes. Gradual[Pg 40]
internal decay hastened by the admixture of the
worship of foreign gods with that of Jehovah;
although Solomon, by the erection of the temple
according to the plan of his father, seems to have
wished to make the worship of the true God the
only religion of the country. An unsuccessful
attempt at rebellion made by Jeroboam; and by
the Edomites, who remain tributary under their
own kings: actual secession, even during the
reign of Solomon, of the conquered province of
Syria by the foundation of the kingdom of Damascus.

Rehoboam.

8. Solomon is succeeded by his son Rehoboam,
who has scarcely ascended the throne,
before the malcontents, increased in number by
his imprudence, break into open rebellion. Jeroboam
is recalled from Egypt, and ten tribes acknowledge
him as their king. Only two tribes,
Judah and Benjamin, remain faithful to Rehoboam.


II. The Jewish state as a divided kingdom, 975&mdash;588.

Causes of the long wars between Judah and Israel.

1. Reciprocal relations between the two kingdoms
of Judah and Israel. Although Israel was
more extensive and populous than Judah, yet was
Judah, in consequence of possessing the capital,
richest of the two; thus their power was nearly
balanced; and hence the struggle between them
was the more obstinate.

Policy of the kings of Israel:

2. The kings of Israel seek to confirm the political
division of the nation, by establishing a
new form of worship within their dominions, in
order to restrain their subjects from visiting the
[Pg 41]ancient seat of the national worship at Jerusalem;
hence they were considered as the enemies of Jehovah.
Several kings, however, even of
of those of Judah.
Judah were so impolitic as to mingle the worship of
other gods with that of Jehovah. But oppression
itself serves to sustain the worship of Jehovah;
the number and political influence of the
prophets increase in proportion as men feel, amid
the turbulence of the times, need of the counsels
of the true God; the idea of some future happier
period under a mighty king&mdash;the idea of the Messiah
and of his kingdom&mdash;is more fully developed
by the lively recollection of the splendid reign of
David.&mdash;Schools of the prophets.

Termination
of the
wars.

3. The rivalry and wars between those two
states not only continue with slight interruption,
but become more and more fraught with danger,
in consequence of the alliances entered into with
foreign princes, particularly with the kings of Damascus
and Egypt. An end is at length put to
these feeble kingdoms by the rise of vast empires
in Inner Asia.

Most important events in the history of the two kingdoms.

1. Kingdom of Israel, 975&mdash;722; under 19 kings, from different
families, who succeeded to the throne amid violent revolutions.
1. Jeroboam, d. 954. Settlement of the royal residence
at Shechem; of the sanctuaries at Bethel and Dan, and appointment
of priests, not belonging to the tribe of Levi. Constant
wars with the kings of Judah. 2. Nadab, Jeroboam's son, murdered
in 953 by 3. Baasha, d. 930. This prince, by his alliance
with the kings of Damascus, brought the kingdom of Judah into
great danger. 4. Elah murdered in 929 by one of his generals.
5. Zimri, in whose place the army immediately elected 6. Omri:
this prince, at the beginning of his reign, had a rival to the
throne in Tibni, d. 925. Omri founded the new capital, Samaria,
d. 918. He was succeeded by his son 7. Ahab: strong connections
by marriage with the kings of Sidon; introduction of[Pg 42]
the Ph&#339;nician worship of Baal. Wars with Damascus, in which
Ahab at last perishes, 897. Under Ahab a league formed with
the king of Judah. He is succeeded by his sons, 8. Ahaziah, d.
896, and 9. Jehoram. The league with Judah continues. Jehoram
is murdered by Jehu, 883. 10. Jehu: this king destroys
the house of Ahab, which had given 4 kings to Israel, and does
away with the worship of Baal. The kings of Damascus wrest
from the kingdom of Israel the lands beyond Jordan. Jehu, d.
856. He is succeeded by his son 11. Jehoahaz, d. 840. The
wars with Damascus continue unsuccessful to Israel. 12. Jehoash,
d. 825. He defeats the kings of Damascus and Judah.
13. Jeroboam II. d. 784. He restores the kingdom of Israel to
its ancient extent. After a turbulent interregnum of 12 years,
he is succeeded by his son 14. Zechariah, 773; who was assassinated
the same year, being the last remnant of the house of
Jehu, which had given 5 kings to Israel. His murderer, 15.
Shallum, after a reign of one month, is, in his turn, assassinated
by 16. Menahem, d. 761: under his reign the first expedition
of the Assyrians, headed by Pul, whom he buys off by tribute.
17. His son Pekahiah murdered in 759 by 18. Pekah, under
whose reign falls the expedition of Tiglath-Pileser the Assyrian,
and destruction of Damascus. Pekah is assassinated in 740 by
19. Hoshea, who, after an anarchy of eight years, obtains possession
of the throne. Hoshea endeavours, by an alliance with
Egypt, to shake off the Assyrian yoke; but Shalmaneser, king
of Assyria, wages war against him, conquers Samaria, and puts
an end to the kingdom of Israel, whose inhabitants he transplants
to Media in Inner Asia, 722.

2. Kingdom of Judah under 20 kings of the house of David,
975&mdash;598. The regular line of hereditary succession is generally
followed without dispute, and is only twice interrupted by
Athaliah's usurpation, and the intervention of foreign conquerors.
1. Rehoboam, d. 958. Jerusalem is still the seat of government;
but even during this reign the worship of Jehovah begins to fall
into neglect, in consequence of the introduction of foreign gods.
Besides the war with Israel, Jerusalem is attacked and plundered
by Shishak, king of Egypt. 2. Abijah, d. 955. 3. Asa.
This prince was attacked by the combined kings of Israel and
Damascus, and, no doubt, would have sunk in the conflict, had
he not succeeded in breaking their alliance; d. 914. 4. Jehoshaphat,
the restorer of the worship of Jehovah and framer of a
league with the kingdom of Israel. His attempt to reestablish[Pg 43]
the trade to Ophir, on the Red sea, is unsuccessful, d. 891. 5.
Jehoram. The union with Israel is confirmed by the marriage
of this prince with Ahab's daughter, Athaliah; but Idum&aelig;a,
under his reign, secedes wholly from the kingdom of Judah, d.
884. 6. His son Ahaziah is, in the next year, 883, assassinated
by Jehu, the murderer and successor of Jehoram king of Israel.
7. His mother, Athaliah, takes possession of the throne; murders
the whole royal family; only one son of Ahaziah, 8, Joash,
is, in consequence of his youth, rescued from the carnage, secretly
educated in the temple, and after seven years forcibly
placed upon the throne, by means of a revolution wrought by
the high priest, Jehoiada; and Athaliah is slaughtered, 877.
Joash rules under the tutelage of the priests, which leads to the
reestablishment of Jehovah's worship. This prince is menaced
by Hazael king of Damascus, and compelled to pay him tribute.
Slain 838. 9. Amaziah: he defeats the Edomites, and is in his
turn defeated by Jehoash king of Israel, by whom Jerusalem itself
is sacked. He is slain in 811, and succeeded 10. by his son
Azariah, (or Uzziah.) This prince was leprous, and d. 759.
His son 11. Jotham, d. 743, became regent during the life of
his father. The wars with Israel and Damascus recommence.
12. Ahaz, d. 728. The league between the kings of Damascus

however, a league with Egypt, in order to throw off the
Babylonian yoke, Nebuchadnezzar marches a third time against
Jerusalem, conquers it, 588, and delivers it up to pillage and
destruction. Zedekiah, after being deprived of his eye-sight,
and losing all his children by the hands of the executioner, is,
together with the remaining portion of the nation, led in captivity
to Babylon.

Nations. 2 vols. 8vo. Oxford, 1831.


Acquaintance
of the
ancients
with Africa.

1.  Although the Ph&#339;nicians had circumnavigated
Africa, the northern part only of that
quarter of the globe was known to antiquity.
With that part, however, the ancients were better
acquainted than we are at the present day, the
coast being then occupied by civilized and commercial
nations, who pushed their excursions far
inland. This was the case in early times with the
Carthaginians and the Egyptians; still more so
with the Macedonian Greeks, under the Ptolemies,
and under the Romans. War, hunting, and
commerce, were, generally speaking, the objects
which gave rise to those excursions.

General
view of
Africa.

2.  Considered as a whole, Africa is very different
from Asia, both in situation and form. Asia
lies almost entirely within the temperate, while
Africa is almost wholly under the torrid zone.
Asia abounds in deep gulfs and large rivers;
Africa constitutes a regular triangle, and in its
northern half possesses but two large rivers, the
Nile and the Niger. No wonder, then, that this
portion of our globe should form, as it were, a
world in itself, distinguished by its productions
and its inhabitants.

Physical
geography
of North
Africa.

3.  Physically considered, Northern Africa may
be divided into three regions, distinguished in
[Pg 46]early antiquity by separate names. The maritime
country along the Mediterranean, with the exception
of Tripolis, or the Regio-Syrtica, consists
principally of very fertile districts, and was consequently,
at all times, very thickly inhabited:
hence in Herodotus it bears the name of the inhabited
Africa; it is now called Barbary. Above
this, and under the 30th parallel of N. lat., succeeds
a mountainous tract, across which stretches
the Atlas chain of mountains; abounding in wild
beasts and dates: hence Herodotus calls it the
wild beast Africa: among the Arabs it is called
the land of dates, (Biledulgerid.) Beyond this,
and between the 30th and 20th degrees of N. lat.
the sandy region extends right across Africa and
Arabia: this part of Africa is therefore known,
both among the ancients and moderns, under the
name of Africa Deserta, or the Sandy Desert,
(Sahara). The fruitful lands beyond the desert,
stretching along the banks of the Niger, were
almost wholly unknown to the Greeks: by them
these parts were comprehended under the common
name of Ethiopia, although that name applied
more peculiarly to the districts above Egypt.
The Greeks were, however, acquainted with some
of the fruitful spots in the desert, the Oases; such
as Augila, Ammonium, and the Oases, properly
so called, in Egypt.

Political
state.

4. There exists no political division which comprises
the whole of Africa. The north coast alone
was inhabited by civilized nations: Egyptians,
Cyren&aelig;ans, and Carthaginians; of which the first
only were aboriginals. The rest of the inhabitants
either roved about as nomad hordes, or[Pg 47]
formed insignificant states, of whose existence we
have heard some account, though we possess no
history of them. Along the shore, reckoning from
the Plinthinetic gulf, Egypt is succeeded by: 1st.
Marmarica, a tract without cities, consisting principally
of sandy deserts, occupied by nomad
hordes: this country extends from the 40&mdash;47&deg;
E. long. from Ferro. 2nd. The fertile territory
occupied by the Greek colonies, called Cyrena&iuml;ca,
extended to the Greater Syrtis, 37&mdash;40&deg; E. long.
Cities: Cyrene, Barca. 3rd. The territory of Carthage,
extending from the Greater Syrtis to the
Fair Promontory, 25&mdash;40&deg; E. long. This territory
comprised (a) the country between the Greater
and Lesser Syrtis, (Regio Syrtica,) which constitutes
the modern kingdom of Tripoli; a sandy
tract, almost wholly occupied by nomads. (b) the
territory of Carthage, properly so called, (kingdom
of Tunis). A very fruitful country; the
southern part, called Byzacena, the northern part
Zeugitana. Cities: Carthage, Utica, etc. 4th.
Numidia and Mauritania; occupied during the
Carthaginian age by nomad races. Along the
shore some Carthaginian settlements.



EGYPTIANS.

Geography.


Preliminary remarks. Egypt in its superficial
contents is equal to about two-thirds of Germany,
and may therefore justly be ranked among the
more extensive countries of the globe; it greatly
varies, however, in its physical properties. The[Pg 48]
soil is only sufficiently fertile for tillage on the
banks of the Nile, and as far as the floods of that
river extend; beyond that, on the west, is a sandy
desert, on the east a chain of rocky mountains.
From its entrance into Egypt at Syene,
Course of the Nile.
the Nile flows in one undivided stream to the city of Cercasorus,
60 geogr. miles above its mouth, directing
its source from south to north through a valley
from 8 to 16 geogr. miles broad, bounded on the
west by deserts of sand, and on the east by mountains
of granite. At Cercasorus the stream first
divides itself into two main branches, which formerly
discharged their waters into the Mediterranean,
the eastern near the city of Pelusium, the
western near the city of Canopus (ostium Pelusiacum
et Canopicum;) from these two diverged several
intermediate branches; so that in the time of
Herodotus there existed seven mouths of the Nile,
but the number has not always remained the same.
The tract between the two extreme arms of the
Nile bears, in consequence of its triangular form,
the name of the Delta; it was covered with cities,
and highly cultivated. The fertile part of Egypt,
inhabited by civilized men, was therefore confined
to the Delta and the valley of the Nile, on the two
banks of the stream from Syene to Cercasorus;
to which must be added some well watered spots
in the centre of the western desert, known under
the name of the Oases. In consequence of the
perpetual absence of rain, particularly in Upper
Egypt, the fertility of the Delta and the valley of
the Nile depends on the overflowing of the river,
which happens at stated periods. This commences
at the beginning of August and continues[Pg 49]
to the end of October; so that during three whole
months the above-mentioned parts of the country
are under water.

Divisions of
Egypt.

Egypt is divided into Upper, extending from
Syene to the city of Chemmis, (capital, Thebes,
or Diospolis); Central from Chemmis to Cercasorus,
(capital, Memphis,) and Lower Egypt,
which comprises the Delta, and the land on both
sides: it was full of cities, among which the most
remarkable was Sais.

Ethiopia.

Next above Egypt lies Ethiopia, (&AElig;thiopia supra
&AElig;gyptum); which, from the earliest times,
principally through commerce, appears to have
been closely connected with the former country.
The regions immediately above Egypt, usually
called Nubia, are little more than deserts of sand,
still inhabited by roving hordes of nomad robbers.
The rocky mountain chain, which forms the eastern
boundary of Egypt, stretches along the Red
sea, and was formerly of great importance to
Nubia, from its containing, just above the
Egyptian frontier, productive gold mines. The
Nile, in this country, makes a wide curve to
the west, and becomes so full of shallows as to
render navigation difficult. The lands adjoining
the river, however, are fertile and well inhabited;
and contain numerous ancient monuments. Still
higher up, reckoning from 16&deg; N. lat. the appearance
of the country changes; the region of fertility
commences, and its costly productions, its
gold and its perfumes, gave rise to a profitable
commerce. Among these countries, Meroe, with
its capital of the same name, was celebrated in the
days of Herodotus. By Meroe is understood a[Pg 50]
tract of land bounded by two rivers, the Nile on
the west, and the Astaboras, (Tacazze,) which
falls into the Nile, on the east; for this reason it
is frequently, although improperly, called an island.
This country extended towards the sources
of the Nile, or the modern province of Gojam,
where, under the reign of Psammetichus, the
Egyptian caste of warriors, having for the most
part deserted, established themselves. Meroe
itself, like the Egyptian states, was sacerdotal,
with a king at its head.&mdash;The city of Axum, or
Auxume, is not indeed mentioned at so early a
period; but if we may judge by the ruins that
still remain, it was of equally high antiquity with
the old Egyptian towns and with Meroe. The
same observations apply to Adule, the harbour
on the Arabian gulf.

Divisions of Egyptian history.

The Egyptian history is divided into three periods
of unequal duration; the first of which extends
from the earliest time down to the Sesostrid&aelig;,
that is to say, to about B. C. 1500: the
second comprises the reigns of the Sesostrid&aelig;, or
the brilliant period of Egypt, down to Psammetichus,
1500&mdash;650: the third brings us from
Psammetichus down to the Persian conquest,
650&mdash;525.



[Pg 51]

FIRST PERIOD.

From the earliest times down to the Sesostrid&aelig;, about
B. C. 1500.

Sources: 1. Jewish writers. Moses. His records contain, no
doubt, a faithful picture of the Egyptian state in his day; but
no continuous history can be deduced from them.&mdash;From Moses
down to Solomon (B. C. 1500&mdash;1000.) total silence, with respect
to Egypt, of the Hebrew writers. From Solomon down to Cyrus,
(B. C. 1000&mdash;550.) a few scanty fragments.&mdash;Importance
and superiority of the Jewish accounts, so far as they are purely
historical. 2. Greek writers. (a) Herodotus. The first who
published a History of the Egyptians. About seventy years after
the destruction of the throne of the Pharaohs by the Persian conquerors,
this author collected, in Egypt itself, the earliest accounts
of the history of the country; he received his information
from the most capable persons, the priests; and wrote down
faithfully that information, such as he heard it. If, therefore,
we would estimate at their proper worth the accounts given by
Herodotus, it is necessary to enquire, what did the priests themselves
know of their earlier national history? And this question
cannot be answered until we have ascertained in what manner
the historical records of the earlier periods were preserved among
the Egyptians.

The earliest history of the Egyptians, like that of all other
nations, was traditional. They adopted, however, before any
other nations, a sort of writing, hieroglyphics, or allegorical picture
writing; in which the signs borrowed from natural objects
served, as modern discoveries have proved, partly to represent
sounds, (hi&eacute;roglyphes phon&eacute;tiques,) and partly to express ideas;
in the latter case they were either representative or allegorical.
This mode of writing, by its nature, is not so complete as the
purely alphabetical; since, 1. It can express only a narrow circle
of ideas, and these separately, without connection or grammatical
inflection, at least with very few exceptions. 2. As it is not
so well adapted to writing as to painting or engraving, it is not
so useful for books as for public monuments. 3. Being em[Pg 52]blematic,
it is not intelligible without the help of a key, which
could only be preserved in some tradition connected with the
monument, and which was exclusively possessed by the priests;
this key, therefore, could hardly be preserved many centuries
without falsification. 4. The same image seems frequently to
have been used to express very different objects.&mdash;It follows, that
the Egyptian history, as deduced from the lips of the priests, can
hardly have been any thing more than records connected with,
and depending upon, public monuments: consisting, therefore,
of mere fragments, and reducible to no consistent chronology,
it ultimately admitted only of allegorical translation, and consequently
was very liable to be misinterpreted. Besides their
hieroglyphics, the Egyptians certainly had two other species of
writing: the hieratic, confined to the priests, and the demotic,
used in common life. Both, however, seem to have been nothing
more than running hands derived from the hieroglyphic system;
and we have no instance of the employment of either the one or
the other in public monuments of the time of the Pharaohs.
That the use of papyrus, a material on which all the above kinds
of writing were employed, had its origin in the highest antiquity,
or at least in the more brilliant period of the Pharaohs, we now
know for certain, written documents belonging to those times
having been obtained from the tombs.

Champollion le jeune, Pr&eacute;cis du Syst&egrave;me Hi&eacute;roglyphique
des anciens Egyptiens. Paris, 1824. The main work on this
subject, of which the Lettre &agrave; M. Dacier, 1822, is but the precursor,
and the two Lettres &agrave; M. le duc de Blacas the continuation.
The new method of deciphering has received its principal
confirmation from the work of the British consul in Egypt,
Salt, Essay on the Phonetic System of Hieroglyphics, 1825,
on the authority of a comparison with the Egyptian monuments
themselves. Hitherto, however, little more has been made out
than the names and titles of the kings, distinguished by being
always enclosed within a border.

These preliminary remarks on the earlier Egyptian history,
will derive abundant support from a perusal of the account given
by Herodotus (ii, 99&mdash;150), of the Egyptian kings previous to
Psammetichus. The study of that author proves beyond all
doubt, that: I. The whole history is throughout founded on public
monuments, and on monuments too, either in or near Memphis.
We may even restrict ourselves to one single monument
at Memphis, to the temple of Vulcan, or Phtha, the chief temple[Pg 53]
of that city. The history commences with Menes, the founder
of that edifice, (c. 99.), and we are informed, respecting each of
his successors, what was done towards the augmentation and
embellishment of the building: those who made no addition to
that temple, but left other monuments, (as the builders of the
pyramids,) are denominated oppressors of the people, and contemners
of the gods: of those princes who left no monuments at
all, the priests could give no other information than a catalogue
of names. II. Hence this line of kings, although the priests
gave it to Herodotus as such, is not without interruptions, but,
as is clearly proved by a comparison with Diodorus, contains
many wide chasms: therefore no chronological system can be
erected upon such a basis. III. The whole history is interwoven
with narrations derived from hieroglyphic representations,
and for that very reason allegorical, the meaning of which it is
no longer possible to unravel, the priests themselves being either
unable or unwilling to explain it, and even inclining, it appears,
to introduce false interpretations. To this class of narrations
belongs, for instance, that of the robbery of Rhampsinitus's treasury;
that of his journey into hell, where he played at dice with
Ceres, (c. 121, 122); that concerning the daughter of Cheops,
(c. 127.); concerning the blindness of Pheron, and the manner in
which he was cured, etc. (c. 111.) To prove that this charge is
not without foundation, it will suffice to adduce two examples;
one from c. 131, where Herodotus himself observes that such was
the case; the other from c. 141, the true meaning of which we
gather from other sources. Even in the time of Herodotus, it
was customary with the priests to endeavour to conciliate the
Greek and Egyptian authorities; a fact in proof of which there
are many arguments which cannot escape the critic: such, for
instance, as the completely Gr&aelig;cised history of king Proteus,
c. 112&mdash;115.&mdash;The general result of the above observations on
Herodotus's Egyptian history is, that it is nothing more than a
narration connected with public monuments. To this inference
but one objection can possibly be made, namely, that the Egyptian
priests possessed, besides their hieroglyphics, an alphabetical
mode of writing; consequently, that, over and above the public
monuments, they might likewise refer to written annals; but
this objection is overthrown by Herodotus himself. All the information
the priests could give him beyond what has been above
alluded to, consisted in the names of 330 kings subsequent to[Pg 54]
Menes; these they read from a papyrus roll, but knew nothing
more of the kings who bore them, because those sovereigns had
left no monuments behind them, (c. 100.)

(b) Besides Herodotus, Diodorus (lib. i.) likewise furnishes us
with the names of some Egyptian kings. This author, who
wrote 400 years subsequently to Herodotus, visited Egypt, and
collected his history, partly from the oral and written documents
of the priests of Thebes, partly from the more ancient Greek
writers, and particularly Hecat&aelig;us. If we consider Herodotus's
line of kings as not continuous or uninterrupted, all appearance
of contradiction between the two historians vanishes. Diodorus,
like Herodotus, did not intend to give a complete enumeration
of the Egyptian kings; but only of the most remarkable; indicating
the interruptions by the number of generations which
they contained.

(c) Finally, different from both the above is the Egyptian
Manetho, high priest at Heliopolis, who flourished under the
reign of Ptolemy Philadelphus, about B. C. 260. He wrote the
&AElig;gyptiaca, of which, besides several fragments in Josephus, the
enumeration of the kings has been preserved in the chronicles of
Eusebius and Syncellus. This catalogue is divided into three
sections, (tomos,) each of which contains several dynasties, in all
31, enumerated according to the different cities of Egypt. In
each dynasty the number of kings belonging to it and the years
of their reigns are marked. The authenticity of Manetho is now
completely established; since the names of the Pharaohs mentioned
by him have been deciphered on the Egyptian monuments.
To this period belong the first seventeen dynasties; in
the eighteenth begins the second and brilliant period, to which
the yet remaining monuments of Upper Egypt, bearing the names
of the founders, are to be ascribed. It is worthy of observation,
that in Herodotus we have the documents of the priests of Memphis,
in Diodorus those of the priests of Thebes, in Manetho
those of the priests of Heliopolis&mdash;the three principal seats of
sacerdotal learning:&mdash;perfect consistency cannot, therefore, be
expected in the accounts of those historians.

The modern writers on Egyptian antiquities, from Kircher,
&#338;dipus &AElig;gyptiacus, 1670, to De Pauw, Recherches sur les
Egyptiens et sur les Chinois, 1772, have too often substituted
their own dreams and hypotheses for truth. The principal attempts
at a chronological arrangement of the dynasties have been[Pg 55]
made by Marsham, in his Canon Chronicus; and by Gatterer,
in his &#8224; Synchronistic History of the World.&mdash;Among
the principal works on this subject may be reckoned:

Early civilization
of
Egypt:

1. Political civilization commenced in Egypt at
a much earlier period than that to which history
reaches; for even in the days of Abraham, and[Pg 56]
still more so in those of Moses, the government
seems to have been so well organized, that a long
period must necessarily have elapsed in order to
raise the nation to that degree of civilization which
we see it had then attained. It may, therefore,
be safely asserted, that Egypt ranks among the
most ancient countries of our globe in which political
associations existed; although we cannot
determine with equal certainty whether they did
not exist still earlier
of India.
in India.

Causes of its early civilization.
The Nile:

2. The causes which contributed to render
Egypt thus early a civilized state, may be found
in the natural features of the country, and its favourable
situation, when compared with the
rest of Africa. It is the only tract in all northern
Africa situated on a large uninterrupted navigable
stream: had it not been for this, it would, like the
other parts of Africa under the same parallel, have
been a mere desert. To this must be added two
extraordinary circumstances: on the one hand,
the overflowing of the river so perfectly prepares
the soil, that to scatter the seed is almost
the only labour of the husbandman; and yet, on
the other hand, so many obstacles impede the
progress of agriculture, (by the necessity of canals,
dams, etc.) that the invention of man must necessarily have been awakened.
commerce.
When agriculture, and the kind of knowledge requisite for its ulterior
development had introduced a certain degree
of civilization into Egypt, the situation of that
country, between Asia and Africa, and in the
neighbourhood of the rich land of gold and spices,
must have been highly favourable to the purposes
of international commerce; hence Egypt appears[Pg 57]
in all ages to have been one of the chief seats of
the inland or caravan trade.

Egyptian
civilization
came from
the south.

3.  It is obvious, therefore, that in the fertile
valley of the Nile, the course of things must have
been very different from what it was in the desert
of Libya. Several small states appear to have
been formed in this valley long before the existence
of any great Egyptian kingdom. Their origin,
as might naturally be supposed, is enveloped
in an obscurity, which history can no longer entirely
penetrate. It may still, however, be gathered
from monuments and records, that Upper
Egypt was first the seat of civilization; which, originating
in the south, spread by the settlement
of colonies towards the north. It is probable
that this took place in consequence of the migration
of some tribe, differing from the negroes, as is
proved by the representations, both in sculpture
and in painting, found on the yet remaining monuments
of Egypt.

4. The records of the high antiquity of political civilization, not only
in India, but likewise in Arabia Felix and Ethiopia, particularly in Meroe,
and the evident vestiges of
Migrations from the south.
ancient intercourse between the southern nations of our globe, prove
with sufficient evidence the truth of such migrations,
although they cannot be chronologically determined.
It is certain, however, that religion
had no small share in producing them. The national
bond of union in Egypt not only continued
in later times, entirely dependent upon religion,
but was originally grounded upon it. Thus every
step in political civilization must have depended,[Pg 58]
if not solely, at least principally, on the caste of
priests and on their extension.

General development of the idea of division into castes. Originating
at first in the variety of tribes settled in one and the
same country, and their different modes of life.&mdash;Its further progress
in despotic and in theocratic kingdoms.&mdash;Application to
Egypt and to the Egyptian caste of priests, as an original, civilized
tribe.

A caste of
priests introduce
their religion
and
civilization
in Egypt.

5. The peculiarity of this caste was the worship
of certain deities, the principal of which were
Ammon, Osiris, and Phtha, confounded by the
Greeks with their Jupiter, Bacchus, and Vulcan.
The spread of this worship, which was always
connected with temples, affords, therefore, the
most evident vestiges of the spread of the caste
itself; and those vestiges combined with the records
of the Egyptians, lead us to conclude that
this caste was a tribe which migrated from the
south, from beyond Meroe in Ethiopia, and by
the establishment of inland colonies around the
temples founded by them, gradually extended and
made the worship of their gods the dominant religion
in Egypt.

Proof of the accuracy of the above theory deduced from monuments
and express testimonies concerning the origin of Thebes
and Ammon from Meroe; it might have been inferred from the
preservation of the worship of Ammon in the latter place. Memphis,
again, and other cities in the valley of the Nile, are commonly
supposed to have been founded by detachments from
Thebes.

Nomes.

6. This conjecture, which agrees with the usual
progress of population, is corroborated by the very
ancient division of the country into districts, or
nomes. This division was intimately connected[Pg 59]
with the chief temples, each of which represented
a separate colony of the caste of priests; so that
the inhabitants of every home belonged to the
chief temple, and joined in the religious worship
there performed.

Separate
states
founded in
Egypt:

7. To the gradual extension of this civilized
tribe, which comprised, not only the caste of the
priests, but certainly also that of the warriors,
and perhaps some others, may be attributed the
formation of several small states along the banks
of the Nile; the central point of each being always
such a colony as we have just now described;
although each state consisted both of the aboriginal
tribes of the neighbourhood, and of those that
had migrated into the country. The bond which
united every separate state was, therefore, as in
most of those formed in the infancy of mankind,
a common worship, in which all the members
participated. But what, by reason of the peculiarities
of soil and climate, could not take
place in southern Africa, took place in Egypt:
agriculture, and its progressive improvement, became
the great support of civilization; and, as
being the true foundation of states, formed the
principal political object of the ruling caste.

Refutation of the idea, that the Egyptian priests were in possession
of great speculative knowledge; since their knowledge
rather had constant reference to practical life, and, therefore, was
in their hands the instrumentum dominationis over the people,
by which they rendered themselves indispensable, and kept the
former in a state of dependence.&mdash;Explanation of the close reference
which their gods, their astronomical and mathematical sciences
bore to agriculture.

Manetho's
account of
them:

8. According to Manetho's catalogues, these
separate Egyptian states existed first in Upper[Pg 60]
and Middle Egypt; in the former were Thebes,
Elephantine, This, and Heraclea; in the latter,
Memphis. It is only in the last division of his
work that we meet with states in Lower Egypt,
such as Tanis, Mendes, Bubastis, and Sebennytus.

To these states, therefore, no doubt, belong the 330 kings
after Menes, whose names the priests read to Herodotus; as also
those whom Diodorus mentions as reigning previous to Sesostris,
among whom are remarked Busiris II. founder of Thebes, and
Uchoreus, the founder of Memphis. Eusebius and Syncellus
have preserved from Manetho the names of several of those
kings, which Marsham has endeavoured to compare and arrange.

obscurity
of their
chronology.

9. In the absence of a certain and continuous
chronology, it is impossible to determine accurately
which of these states were contemporary,
and which succeeded the others. There can be
no question that Thebes was one of the earliest,
if not indeed the most ancient of them all; certainly
prior to Memphis, which was founded by
it. According to the natural order of things,
some of these states became wealthy and mighty,
and swallowed up the others. Even at this early
period, Thebes and Memphis had obtained a superiority
over the rest.

This and Elephantine appear to have been united to Thebes;
as were the states of Lower Egypt to Memphis.

Memphis a
powerful
state in Joseph's
time:
about 1800,
B. C.

10. The Mosaic records prove, that even in Joseph's
time the state of Memphis (the real place,
it appears, of his residence, not On, or Heliopolis,)
comprised Middle and Lower Egypt. It possessed
a numerous and brilliant court; castes of priests
and warriors. Its agriculture flourished, and several
of its institutions indicated a deeply-rooted
civilization. But after the establishment of vassal[Pg 61]age
in this state by Joseph, when the class of free
proprietors was destroyed, by making the king
the only landholder except the priests, the troubles
which already threatened the kingdom must have
assumed a more dangerous and alarming aspect.

Invasions
by the
nomad.


11.  These troubles came from abroad. Egypt,
surrounded on all sides by nomad tribes, had
often suffered from their irruptions, which sometimes
poured in from the south, sometimes from the
east. But never were these invasions so frequent
and durable as in the period which immediately
followed the administration of Joseph. Lower Egypt was overrun by
the Bedouin Arabs, whose chieftains, called by the Egyptians
Hyksos, or Bedouins.
Hyksos, settled
in the country, fortified Avaris, or Pelusium,
and extended their dominion to Memphis, which
they made probably the seat of their government.
They are depicted as the oppressors of religion,
and of the caste of priests; but when we consider
that Moses flourished in their time, we are led to
infer that, like the Mongols in China, they must
have gradually adopted Egyptian manners and
civilization. They do not appear to have gained
possession of Thebes in Upper Egypt; and it
seems highly probable, that the long struggle
against them was never, or at least but for a short
time, suspended.

The dominion of the Arabian Hyksos falls between B. C.
1800&mdash;1600; and consequently was contemporary with Moses
and the exodus of the Jews. Josephus gives 500 years to their
dominion, in which he probably comprises the long periods of
earlier wars.

Expulsion of the Hyksos:
and rising splendour of Egypt.


12. Defeat, and final expulsion of the Hyksos
from Upper Egypt by Thutmosis king of Thebes.
The consequence of this event was not only
[Pg 62]
the restoration of freedom and independence to
Egypt, but also the union of the different states
into one kingdom; as the rulers of Thebes now
became monarchs over all Egypt. This expulsion
of the Hyksos, which in itself cannot be considered
otherwise than as a vast national effort,
must have been the more deeply impressed on
the memory of the people, as it laid the foundation
of the splendid period which immediately
followed.

The expulsion of the Hyksos appears to have been one of
the chief subjects on which the Egyptian artists exercised their
talents: it is supposed to have been represented upon one of the
large temples in Thebes. Denon, plate cxxxiii.



SECOND PERIOD.

From the Sesostrid&aelig; until the sole dominion of Psammetichus.
B. C. 1500&mdash;650.

The sources for this period are the same as for the foregoing;
and the history still preserves the character of records handed
down by hieroglyphics. To this period belongs the line of kings
subsequent to Sesostris, given both by Herodotus and Diodorus.
Those two historians nearly agree, if we regard Herodotus's line
of kings, not as uninterrupted, but as the fragments of a series
deduced solely from public monuments: this will be demonstrated
by the following table, in which the predecessors of Sesostris
have likewise been indicated.





Herodotus.Diodorus.
Menes.Menes.
He was followed by three hundred and thirty kings belonging
to the previous period, concerning which our information is very incomplete: among
those sovereigns were eighteen Ethiopians, and one queen
named Nitocris.
Followed by fifty-two successors, ranging over a period of more than 1400 years.
Busiris I. and eight successors; the last of whom was
Busiris II. the founder of Thebes.[Pg 63]
Osymandyas and eight successors;
the last of whom was
Uchoreus, founder of Memphis.
&AElig;gyptus, grandson of the foregoing. After the lapse of twelve generations,
M&#339;ris.M&#339;ris.
Seven generations.
Sesostris.Sesostris or Sesoosis.
Pheron, son of Sesostris.
Sesostris II. son of the foregoing:
he assumed his father's name.
Interval comprising several generations.
Amasis, and the Ethiopian,
Actisanus.
Mendes or Manes, builder of the labyrinth.
Anarchy which lasted five generations.
Proteus, in the time of the Trojan war.Proteus or Cetes, in the time of the Trojan war.
Rhampsinitus.
Remphis, son of the foregoing.

Seven generations, in the course of which flourished Nileus, from whom the Nile derives its name.
Cheops, builder of the great pyramid.Chemmis or Chembes, from Memphis, builder of the great pyramid.
Chephres, brother to the foregoing, builder of a pyramid.Cephren, brother to the foregoing, builder of a pyramid.
Mycerinus, son of Cheops, builder of a pyramid.Mycerinus, son of Chemmis, builder of a pyramid.
Asychis the legislator.Bochoris the legislator.
Anysis, who was blind.Interval of several generations.[Pg 64]
Sabaco, the Ethiopian.Sabaco, the Ethiopian
Anysis, king for the second time.
Sethos, a priest of Vulcan.
Dodecarchy.Dodecarchy.
Psammetichus of Sais, sole ruler.Psammetichus of Sais, sole ruler.


This comparative table demonstrates evidently, not only that
Herodotus's line is often interrupted, but likewise that it is impossible
to establish any continuous chronology, since Diodorus,
more than once leaves the number of generations undetermined.
Great importance, nevertheless, attaches to the date fixed by
Herodotus, ii, 13, where he declares that king M&#339;ris flourished
900 years before his own visit to Egypt: consequently between
B. C. 1500 and 1450. And if, as seems highly probable, the age
of Sesostris was the 15th century B. C. (see Zoega, de Obeliscis),
it cannot be denied but that we have some general epochs; and
with these we must remain content until more satisfactory information
can be discovered on the monuments. It should likewise
be observed, that the discrepancy between the names of the
kings mentioned by Herodotus and Diodorus, and those furnished
by Manetho, may be accounted for by the fact, that the
sovereigns were distinguished by different names on the monuments
and in common life.

Of the dynasties of Manetho, the 18th, 19th, 20th, and 22nd,
belong to this period; more especially the two first, which contain
the most important of the Pharaohs.

Brilliant
period of
the Pharaohs.

1. The following period, nearly to its termination,
was the brilliant age of Egypt, during which
it formed but one empire; the kings being represented
as sovereign lords of the whole country.
And, indeed, it was natural that the expulsion
of the invaders should be followed by a period
in which the military force and ardour of the
nation would be developed, and directed to ex[Pg 65]ternal
conquest. The capital of the empire was,
no doubt, Thebes, the great monuments of which
were erected in this period; that honour, however,
seems to have alternately belonged to Memphis,
Herodotus's line of kings being deduced
from the monuments of that city, and more especially
from the temple of Phtha.

The more powerful of the Pharaohs of this period, and the
founders of the most important monuments of Upper Egypt, on
which their names are found, are the following: belonging to
the 18th dynasty, somewhere about 1600&mdash;1500.

Amenophis I. His name is likewise found beyond Egypt on
the temple of Amada, in Nubia.

Thutmosis I. Commencement of the expulsion of the Hyksos.

Amenophis II. The Memnon of the Greeks. Complete expulsion
of the Hyksos, and commencement of several of the
great edifices. His name is also found on the monuments of
Thebes, Elephantine, and even in Nubia, on the distant temple
of Soleb. Builder of the palace of Luxor.

Thutmosis II. His name found in Carnac, and on the obelisk
at the Lateran.

Ramesses I. Supposed to be the Danaus of the Greeks. Expelled
by his brother:

Ramesses II. Miamun. Builder of the palace of Medinet-Abu
in Thebes. One of the royal graves that have been opened
belongs to this king.

Amenophis III. Renewed invasion of the Hyksos; he flees
before them into Ethiopia; but returns victorious with his son
Ramesses.

Belonging to the 19th dynasty, between 1500 and 1400.

Ramesses III., called the Great, and sometimes Sesostris;
founder of the dynasty, liberator of Egypt, and a great conqueror.
His name and titles, his wars and triumphs, are found
on the temples and palaces of Luxor and Carnac, in Thebes and
Nubia. His son and follower:

Ramesses IV. Pheron, rules long in peace. His name is
found in the great pillared hall of the palace of Carnac, and on
many other buildings.

Among his successors but few names have been preserved
until we come to Scheschonk or Sisac, of the 22nd dynasty, be[Pg 66]tween
970 and 950; he took Jerusalem under the reign of Rehoboam,
and therefore furnishes a fixed date.

of the most ancient History and Geography of Egypt and
Ethiopia, with an atlas, 1827. A work containing every thing
necessary for understanding the discoveries hitherto made in this
department of history.


Splendid
reign of
Sesostris.

2. For this splendour, the empire was principally
indebted to Sesostris, son of Amenophis.
This prince is justly entitled to the surname of
Great, which was given him by the Egyptians.
No one will, to the letter, credit the narrative of
his deeds, exaggerated as they were by the traditions
of the priests, or represented, as they still
appear, on the buildings of Thebes; but who can
doubt the existence of a monarch of whom so
many and such various monuments within and
without Egypt bear witness?

Critical examination of the accounts of the nine years' campaign,
and conquests of Sesostris. His arms were principally
directed against wealthy commercial countries; probably by
land against Ethiopia, Asia Minor, and part of Thrace; by sea
against Arabia Felix, perhaps even the Indian peninsula. Can
the performance of these exploits be deemed improbable, in an
age when western Asia did not contain a single great empire?
The vast undertakings attributed to Sesostris in the interior of
his dominions; extensive buildings, canals, division of the land,
and imposition of taxes, according to a regular survey, prove that
he must have been the sovereign of all Egypt.


State of
the constitution.

3. Notwithstanding the great changes that were
made, the constitution still bore the same general
character, that of a sacerdotal aristocracy combined
with a monarchy. Although the Egyptian
kings, like the Indian princes, were distinct from
the priests, yet their power was limited in various
ways by that caste. The high priest shared the
royal authority; the king was shackled by reli[Pg 67]gious
ceremonies, both in public and private life;
he was obliged to evince his veneration for the
established worship by the erection of public monuments;
and all the high offices of state were
in the hands of the priests. It cannot be denied
that on the personal character of the king
depended much of his power; but how strong
must have been this aristocracy, when even successful
conquerors were obliged to conciliate its
approbation!

Division
into castes.

4. It was probably about this time that the
domestic relations of the people, the division into
castes, was completed. The sacerdotal caste
being in exclusive possession of all scientific
knowledge, remained for that reason in possession
of the offices of state. The caste of warriors
could hardly have assumed its complete form before
the country was united into one empire: in
like manner that of the navigators could not have
been completely established before the canals
were excavated; although the origin of all may
have been of a much earlier date.

Comparison of the accounts given by Herodotus and Diodorus
of the division into castes. Not only precedence in time, but
likewise the discrepancies between the two, declare in favour of
Herodotus.

Prosperous
period of Egypt,
B. C. 1500&mdash;900.
714.


5. It appears, therefore, that the most prosperous
period of the kingdom of the Pharaohs must
be placed somewhere between B. C. 1500&mdash;900:
although, according to Diodorus, even this period
was interrupted by a long anarchy. The splendour
of the empire was obscured towards the end.
Sabaco, a foreign conqueror from Ethiopia, (probably
from Meroe,) subjugated Egypt; after his
[Pg 68]
departure from the country, Sethos, a priest of
Phtha, contrary to all precedent, seated himself
upon the throne. He was, consequently, considered
an usurper; he offended the caste of
warriors, and could not have escaped the dangers
of an irruption threatened by the Assyrian, Sennacherib,
had not a pestilence compelled the invader
and his host to retreat.

The dynasty of Sabaco, Seuechus, and Tarhaco in Meroe,
who as conquerors subjected Upper Egypt, is comprised between
B. C. 800&mdash;700. Their names likewise have been already discovered
on monuments; some at Abydos in Egypt, others in
Nubia.

Dodecarchy.

6. The Egyptian monarchy, however, at length
fell, and was replaced by an oligarchy; (or perhaps
a return was only made to the division of the
earlier kingdoms;) twelve princes sharing among
themselves the sovereign power. A certain degree
of unity seems to have existed at first in this
government; but quarrels soon sprung up among
the princes, and they compelled one of their
number, Psammetichus of Sais, to take flight.
About B. C. 650.
The exiled prince, supported by Greek and Carian
mercenaries, contrived to avenge his wrongs; he
drove away his rivals, and became the sole ruler.




[Pg 69]
THIRD PERIOD.

From the reign of Psammetichus as sole monarch to the
Persian conquest of Egypt by Cambyses.
B. C. 650&mdash;525.

Herodotus, (l. ii, c. 125, etc.) is still the principal authority for
this portion of history. His statements, however, are no longer
derived from hieroglyphics: they are purely historical. During
the reign of Psammetichus, the Greeks who had migrated into
Egypt gave rise to the caste of interpreters,
&#7953;&#961;&#956;&#951;&#957;&#949;&#8150;&#962;, who acted
both as ciceroni for strangers, and as brokers between the Egyptians
and Greeks: these people were enabled to give information
respecting the history of the country. It is not, therefore, surprising
that Herodotus should assure us, that from this time the
history was authentic.&mdash;The names of the succeeding Pharaohs
are likewise found on the monuments; in the erection of which
they rivaled their predecessors.

Contemporary: Asia: rise and fall of the Chald&aelig;o-Babylonian
empire; rise of the Persian monarchy.&mdash;Rome: kings from
Numa Pompilius to Servius Tullius.&mdash;Athens: Draco; Solon;
Pisistratus.&mdash;Jews: the last period and fall of the kingdom of
Judah; Babylonish captivity.


Revolutions
in
Egypt.

1. From this epoch Egypt remained uninterruptedly
one kingdom, the capital of which was
Memphis, although Sais, in Lower Egypt, was the
general residence of the royal family. Strangers,
and more particularly Greeks, admitted into
Egypt; partly as mercenaries, partly as merchants.
Influence of this innovation upon the
national character, and upon the political system
in particular. A spirit of conquest gradually inherited
by the Egyptian kings, is directed principally
against Asia: hence the formation of a navy,[Pg 70]
and wars with the great rising monarchies of Asia.
Continued, but declining influence of the sacerdotal
caste, and proofs of the veneration of the
kings for the priesthood deduced from the erection
and embellishment of temples, particularly of that
consecrated to Phtha in Memphis.

Psammetichus
d.
B. C. 610.

2. Psammetichus. He obtains sole power
through the assistance of Greek and Carian mercenaries,
who are continued as a standing army in
the country. The caste of Egyptian warriors,
taking umbrage in consequence, emigrate for the
most part to Ethiopia, where they settle. The
southern portico of the temple of Phtha is erected,
and projects of conquest are formed against Asia.

Neco d.
594.

3. Neco, son and successor of Psammetichus.
His extensive plans of conquest. First formation
of a naval power; and unsuccessful attempt to
unite by a canal the Mediterranean with the Red
sea. Conquests in Asia as far as the Euphrates;
but quick secession of the conquered, in consequence
of the loss of the battle of Circesium.
606.
Circumnavigation of Africa undertaken at his
command by the Ph&#339;nicians, and successfully
performed.

Psammis d.
458.

4. Psammis his son and successor. Expedition
against Ethiopia, and conquests in the interior of
Africa.

Apries d.
563.

5. Reign of Apries, (the Pharaoh-hophra of the
Hebrews). Plans of conquest against Asia;&mdash;siege
of Sidon, and naval battle with the Tyrians;&mdash;expedition
against Cyrene in Africa; its fatal
result. A revolution caused thereby in Egypt,
the inhabitants of which were averse to foreign
wars, carried on mostly by mercenary aliens: the[Pg 71]
revolution headed by Amasis. In the civil war
which Apries now wages with his mercenaries
against the Egyptians commanded by Amasis,
he loses both his throne and life; and with him
ends the family of Psammetichus, which had
reigned to this time.

Amasis d.
525.

6. The usurper Amasis took possession of the
sovereign power; and although he had to contend
with a strong party, who despised him on account
of his low origin, he contrived by popular measures,
and by the respect he showed to the sacerdotal
caste, to establish himself upon the throne.&mdash;His
monuments, both at Sais and Memphis.&mdash;The
Egyptians and Greeks become better acquainted
and more closely connected with each
other, partly in consequence of the marriage of
the king with a Greek woman; but principally
owing to the mouths of the Nile being opened to
the Greek merchants, and the cession of Naucratis
as a factory for their merchandise. Great
and beneficial consequences to Egypt, which,
under the long reign of Amasis, reaches its highest
pitch of prosperity. This prince had already been
engaged in disputes with the Persian conqueror,
Cyrus, whose son and successor, Cambyses, led
an expedition against Egypt, which Amasis, however,
luckily for himself, escaped by a seasonable
death.

Psammenitus.
525.

7.  His son Psammenitus, the last of the Egyptian
Pharaohs, is attacked by Cambyses in the
very first year of his reign. After a single battle,
fought at Pelusium, and a short siege of Memphis,
the empire of the Pharaohs is overthrown, and
Egypt merges into a Persian province. The[Pg 72]
powerful caste of the priests suffered most from
the hatred of the conqueror; but the persecution
to which they were subjected must be attributed
rather to policy than fanaticism.

Egypt a
province of
Persia.

8. Condition and fate of Egypt as a Persian
province. After the death of Cambyses, the
country received a Persian governor, and consequently
became a satrapy. Immediately after
the first tempest of war had blown over, Egypt
was treated with mildness by the Persians. The
country paid a moderate tribute, together with
some royal gifts, among others the produce of the
Revolts
fisheries in lake M&#339;ris; nevertheless,
repeated revolts occurred, which may be principally attributed
to the hatred and influence of the sacerdotal caste.
The first took place under Darius Hystaspes,
488 to 484.
and was quelled by Xerxes. An increase
of tribute was the consequence.
The second, under king Inarus, fomented and supported
by the Athenians, happened during the reign of Artaxerxes I.;
463 to 456.
it was quelled by Megabyzus.
The third occurred under Darius II. and in consequence
of the support which the Egyptians received
from the Greeks, was of longer duration
than either of the former, the throne of the Pharaoh's
414.
being in some measure restored.

This third secession of the Egyptians lasted till 354. During
this period various kings were appointed; Amyrt&aelig;us, d. 408;
Psammetichus, about 400; Nephreus, about 397; Pausiris, d.
375; Nectanebus I. d. 365; Tachos, d. 363; Nectanebus II.
conquered by Artaxerxes III. 354.



[Pg 73]
CARTHAGINIANS.


Sources. The first great republic which ancient records mention
as applying both to trade and war, is undoubtedly a phenomenon
well deserving the attention of the historical enquirer.
Our knowledge, however, of Carthaginian history is unfortunately
very deficient, as we possess no author who has made it the principal
object of his attention. The immediate subject of the
Greek and Roman writers was the history of their own country,
and they only allude to that of Carthage in so far as it is connected
with their main topic. This observation applies as well
to Polybius and Diodorus, as to Livy and Appian. Even the
information given by Justin, the only author who says any thing
concerning the early state of Carthage, is miserably defective,
although taken from Theopompus. (Cf. Comment. de fontibus
Justini in Commentat. Soc. Gotting. vol. xv.) Moreover, as
Herodotus here fails us, we have not the writings of any author
whatever who witnessed Carthage in the days of her prosperity:
Polybius did not see that country till after the decline of its
power; the other historians, wrote long afterwards. But although
an uninterrupted history of Carthage does not exist, we are yet
able to trace the main outlines of the picture of that state.&mdash;The
modern writers on Carthage are:

Hendrich, de Republica Carthaginiensium, 1664. A useful
compilation.

&#8224; History of the Republic of Carthage, 2 vols. Franckfort,
1781. A mere history of the wars.

Dampmartin, Histoire de la Rivalit&eacute; de Carthage et de
Rome, tom. i, ii. Very superficial.

1827. The best work on the subject; in which use has been
made of modern researches.

Periods of
Carthaginian
history.

The history of Carthage is most conveniently
divided into three periods: I. From the foundation
of the city to the commencement of the wars
with Syracuse, B. C. 880&mdash;480. II. From the[Pg 74]
commencement of the wars with Syracuse to
those with Rome, 480&mdash;264.  III. From the
commencement of the wars with Rome to the
destruction of Carthage, 264&mdash;146.



FIRST PERIOD.

From the foundation of Carthage to the wars with Syracuse,
B. C. 880&mdash;480.

Contemporary: Inner Asia: kingdoms of the Assyrians, Babylonians,
and first half of the Persian monarchy. Greeks:
period from Lycurgus to Themistocles. Romans: period of the
kings, and of the commonwealth until the establishment of the
tribunes of the people.

Early history
of Carthage

1. The foundation and primitive history of Carthage,
like all very early and important events in
national history, have, by long tradition, been
wrapt in the veil of romance. The account given
of Dido, the supposed founder of the city, cannot
be reduced to the standard of pure historical
truth, though it appears to justify the inference
that some political commotions in the mother city,
Tyre, induced a party of emigrants to proceed to
the northern shores of Africa; where other Ph&#339;nician
establishments had already taken place:
here, by engaging to pay a yearly tribute, they
purchased from the natives permission to found a
city, the site of which was so happily chosen,
that it only depended upon the inhabitants to
raise it to that greatness which it afterwards attained.

Vast extent
of the Carthaginian
dominions.

2. It is probable that Carthage advanced at
[Pg 75]first by slow steps; yet even at the end of this
first period she had reached to such a height of
power, that she was mistress of a large territory
in Africa, and of foreign possessions still more
extensive. Establishment of the Carthaginian
dominion in Africa by the subjection of the neighbouring
aboriginal tribes, and the foundation of
Carthaginian settlements within their territories;
the natives, Liby-Ph&#339;nicians, gradually mingled
with the inhabitants of those colonies, and imbibed
from them a love of agriculture and fixed
abodes. The inhabitants of the fertile territory
extending southward as far as the lake Triton,
were, without exception, Carthaginian subjects.

Relation of
Carthage
with the
other Tyrian
colonies of
Africa:

3. Her connection, however, with the ancient
Ph&#339;nician towns along the coast, particularly
Utica, was of a different nature. For although
possessed a certain authority over them,
she did not claim absolute dominion, but rather
stood at the head of a federation; thus affording
a protection which must frequently have degenerated
into oppression.

with the
Greek colony
of Cyrene.

4. In consequence of a treaty with the neighbouring
republic of Cyrene, the whole territory
extending between the two Syrtes was also ceded
to the Carthaginians. The Lotophagi and Nasamones,
inhabitants of this district, preserved their
nomad mode of life; they must, however, from
their trade with the interior parts of Africa, have
been of the highest importance to Carthage.

Carthaginian colonies:
Sardinia;
Baleares;
Corsica:
part of Sicily:
Canaries;
Madeira.

5.  System of colonization, and, as a necessary
result, that of conquest without Africa.  It was
evidently the aim of the Carthaginians to settle
on islands, and to subject them to their dominion.
[Pg 76]Those lying in the western part of the Mediterranean
occupied the first place in their plan of conquest,
which was completely executed in Sardinia,
the Baleares, and other small islands; perhaps
in Corsica; in Sicily, however, they could
never succeed to the full extent of their wishes.
There is also every probability that the Canary
islands and Madeira were entirely in their possession.
On the other hand, the Carthaginians,
previous to their wars with Rome, were in the
practice of establishing separate settlements on
the main land, partly in Spain, and partly on the
western shore of Africa. In the latter, they
adopted the policy of their ancestors, the Ph&#339;nicians,
making the settlements so small, and
confining them within such narrow bounds, that
the mother country might always ensure their
dependence.

Conquests of Mago and his family.
Carthage connected with Persia, B. C. 550&mdash;480.
Sea fight between the Carthaginians and Phoc&aelig;ans.
Colonies without the straits of Gibraltar.
539.
First treaty with Rome, 509.


6. The glory of extending the territory of Carthage,
by important conquests, belongs principally
to the family of Mago, who, together with his two
sons and six grandsons, established the dominion
of the republic in Sicily, Sardinia, and Africa.
This occurred about the same time that Cyrus,
Cambyses, and Darius were laying the foundation
of the Persian monarchy, with which
Carthage even then entered into connection. The Carthaginians,
therefore, made their first appearance, as
extensive conquerors, in the fourth century from
the foundation of their commonwealth; and it is
at this period that mention is made of their first
naval engagement, in which the Phoc&aelig;ans were
their adversaries. In the same period may be
dated the establishment of their colonies beyond
[Pg 77]
the Pillars of Hercules by Hanno and Himilco&mdash;both
probably sons of Mago;&mdash;by the former on
the coast of Africa, by the latter on that of Spain.
To the same period likewise is referred the first
commercial treaty between the Carthaginians and
Romans, in which the former appear as already
masters of Sardinia, Africa, and a portion of
Sicily.

7.  To complete these conquests, and to preserve
them when completed, the formation and
support of vast fleets and armies were indispensably
necessary. According to the usual practice
Arts military and naval of Carthage.
of those nations who apply both to trade and to
war, the Carthaginian armies were composed for
the most part of mercenaries. No nation, however,
followed this plan so extensively as the
Carthaginians, for to them half Africa and Europe
furnished warriors.&mdash;Description of a Carthaginian

public property.

and civil
functions

divided.

8.  The political constitution of Carthage, like
that of all wealthy trading states, was an aristocracy
composed of the noble and the opulent,
though at all times combined with a certain admixture
of democracy. The affairs of the state
were confided to the hands of the two suffetes or
kings,&mdash;who, in all probability, held their office
for life&mdash;and to those of the senate (&#946;&#959;&#965;&#955;&#8052;) which
contained within itself a more select council (the
&#947;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#943;&#945;). The privilege of electing the magistrates
[Pg 78]resided with the people at large, who also shared
the legislative power with the suffetes. Civil and
military power was usually divided: the offices
of general and magistrate not being always, as at
Rome, united in the same individual,&mdash;although
such an instance might not be of impossible occurrence:&mdash;to
each military chief, on the contrary,
was appointed a committee from the senate, on
which he was more or less dependent.

Supreme
court of the
hundred:
its object;


9.  The high state tribunal of the HUNDRED was
instituted as a barrier to the constitution against
the attempts of the more powerful aristocrats,
particularly the military leaders; indeed the brilliancy
of Mago's conquests seemed to threaten
the republic with a military government; and immediately
previous to his time one of the generals,
Malchus, had actually made an attempt to
enslave Carthage. The object of the institution
was no doubt attained; but in later times the
council assumed to itself a power which increased
its evils.
to absolute despotism. It is not improbable that
this court likewise constituted the select committee
(the &#947;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#943;&#945;) of the senate.

Finances of Carthage.
Tributes from the African federates:
Sardinia, etc.
the Syrtic hordes:
dues and customs:
mines.

10.  Our information respecting the financial
system of the Carthaginians is extremely meagre.
The following seem to have been the principal
sources of the public revenue. 1. The tribute
drawn from the federate cities, and their African
subjects. The former paid in money, the latter
for the most part in kind; this tribute was imposed
at the will of the government, so that in
pressing cases the taxed nations were obliged to
give one half of their income. 2. The case was
the same with their external provinces, parti[Pg 79]cularly
with Sardinia. 3. The tribute furnished
by the nomad hordes, partly by those in the
Regio-Syrtica, and occasionally also by those on
the western side. 4. The customs, which were
levied with extreme rigour, not only in Carthage,
but likewise in all the colonies. 5. The products
of their rich mines, particularly those of Spain.
In considering the financial system of the Carthaginians,
it should not be forgotten that many of
the nations with whom they traded, or who served
in their armies, were unacquainted with the use
of money.

Trade of
Carthage:

11. System and extent of their commerce.
Their object was to secure a monopoly of the
western trade; hence the practice of restricting
the growth of their colonies, and of removing as
much as possible all strangers from their commercial
marts. Their trade was carried on partly
by sea to Britain and the Guinea coast;
by sea, and partly by land. Their sea trade,
arising from the colonies, extended beyond the
Mediterranean, certainly as far as the coasts of
Britain and Guinea. Their land trade was carried
on by caravans, consisting principally of the
nomad tribes resident between the Syrtes: the
by land to the interior of Africa.
caravans travelled eastward to Ammonium and
Upper Egypt, southward to the land of the Garamantes,
(Fezzan,) and even still further into the
interior of Africa.

SECOND PERIOD.

From the breaking out of the wars with Syracuse, to the
commencement of those with Rome, B. C. 480&mdash;264.

Views of
Carthage
upon Sicily.

1. The great object of Carthaginian policy
during the whole of the above period, was to
subdue Sicily; this object the nation pursued
with extraordinary pertinacity, often approximating
to, but never obtaining, complete success.
The growing power of Syracuse, which likewise
aimed at the sole possession of the island, laid
the foundation of that national hatred which now
arose between the Sicilian Greeks and the Carthaginians.

rout at Himera
by
Gelon,
B. C. 480.

2. First attempt, arising out of the league
formed with Xerxes I. upon his irruption into
Greece. Gelon of Syracuse, in a victory more
decisive even than that gained by Themistocles
over the Persians at Salamis, routs the Carthaginians
near Himera, and compels them to accede
to a disgraceful peace.

General extension
of
the Carthaginian
empire
in
Africa,
480&mdash;410.

3. This defeat was followed by a period of
tranquillity lasting seventy years, during which
we know little about Carthage. All that we can
say with any probability is, that in the mean time
the struggle for territory between Cyrene and
Carthage commenced and terminated to the advantage
of the latter state, whose dominion was
generally extended and confirmed in Africa by
wars with the aboriginal tribes.[Pg 81]

War in
Sicily renewed,
410.

4.  But the accession of Dionysius I. to the
throne of Syracuse, and the ambitious project
formed by him and his successors, of subjecting
to their rule all Sicily and Magna-Grecia, rekindled
once more the embers of war, which had
only smouldered for a short time, to burst forth
with additional violence.

Repeated and bloody wars with Dionysius I. between the
years 410&mdash;368. Neither party able to expel the other: terms
of the last peace; that each party should remain in possession of
what he then occupied. Second commercial treaty with Rome.

Crafty advantage taken by the Carthaginians of the internal
commotions at Syracuse during and subsequent to the reign of
Dionysius II: they endeavour to obtain their end; but are
thwarted by the heroism of Timoleon, 345&mdash;340.

A new and frightful war with Agathocles, the seat of which
is transferred from Sicily into Africa itself; it at last terminates
in favour of Carthage, 311&mdash;307.

The war with Pyrrhus, 277&mdash;275, whose ambition gave rise to
an alliance between Carthage and Rome, contributed likewise to
increase the preponderance of the Carthaginians in Sicily; and
probably the perseverance of that people, and their skill in profiting
by circumstances, would at last have enabled them to
attain their object, had not the seeds of war been thereby scattered
between Carthage and Rome.

Two attempts
at
revolution.
340;
308.

Excellent
state of the
Carthaginian
finances
at
the beginning of the
first Punic
war.

5.  What effect these Sicilian wars had upon
the state we are not informed. They were probably
regarded in Carthage as a beneficial channel
for carrying off the popular fermentation;&mdash;nevertheless,
two attempts, both unsuccessful,
were made by some of the aristocratical party, to
overthrow the constitution; first by Hanno, 340,
and afterwards by Bomilcar, 308.&mdash;At the breaking
out, however, of the war with Rome, the
commonwealth was so formidable and mighty,
that even the finances of the state do not appear
[Pg 82]to have been at all affected; a circumstance of
the highest importance. What consequence was
it to Carthage whether 100,000 barbarians more
or less existed in the world, so long as there remained
plenty of men willing to suffer themselves
to be sold, and she possessed money to purchase
them?


THIRD PERIOD.

From the beginning of the wars with Rome, to the downfal
of Carthage, B. C. 264&mdash;146.

Causes of
the Punic
wars.

1. The wars between Carthage and Rome were
the necessary consequences of a desire of aggrandizement
in two conquering nations; any one
might have foreseen the struggle between the
two rivals as soon as their conquests should once
begin to clash. It is, therefore, a question of
little importance, to enquire which was the aggressor;
and although Rome may not be entirely
cleared of that charge, we cannot help observing
that, according to the principles of sound policy,
the security of Italy was hardly compatible with
the sole dominion of the Carthaginians over the
island of Sicily.

First war with Rome, 264&mdash;241, (twenty-three years,) waged
for the possession of Sicily, and decided almost at its commencement
by Hiero's passing over to the Roman side. (For the history
of it, see below, in the Roman history, Book V. Period ii,
parag. 2 sq.)[Pg 83]

Fatal consequences
of the first
Punic war
to Carthage.

2. This war cost the republic, Sicily and the
sovereignty of the Mediterranean, by which the
fate of its other external possessions was already
predetermined. But that which appeared at the
first view to threaten the greatest danger, was
the total exhaustion of its finances; a circumstance
which will no longer surprise us, when we
consider how many fleets had been destroyed and
replaced, how many armies had been annihilated
and renewed. Carthage had never before been
engaged in such an obstinate struggle as this; and
the immediate consequences were more terrific
even than the war itself.

Dreadful
civil war,
B. C. 240&mdash;237.

3. The impossibility of paying the mercenaries
produced a mutiny among the troops, which rapidly
grew into a rebellion of the subject nations,
who had been most cruelly oppressed during the
war. The consequence was a civil war of three
years and a half, which probably would have
spared the Romans the trouble of destroying Carthage,
had not the state been snatched from ruin
by the heroism of Hamilcar.

This war, which lasted from 240 to 237, produced lasting consequences
to the state; it gave rise to the feud between Hamilcar
and Hanno the Great, which compelled Hamilcar to seek
for support against the senate by becoming the leader of a democratic
faction.

Sardinia is
lost, 237.

4. The revolt spread abroad; it reached Sardinia
and caused the loss of that most important
island, of which the Romans, flushed with power,
took possession, in spite of the terms of the
peace.

Rise of the
house of the
Barcas:

5. The influence of the family of the Barcas,
supported in their disputes with the senate by the
[Pg 84]popular party, now got the upper hand in Carthage;
and the first fruit of their power was the
new and gigantic project of repairing the loss of
Sicily and Sardinia by the conquest of Spain; a
vast projects upon Spain,
country where the Carthaginians already had
some possessions and commercial connections.
The immediate object of the Barcas was the support
of their family and party; but the Spanish
silver mines soon furnished the republic with the
means of renewing the contest with Rome also.

and Hasdrubal,

By treaty

Carthagena founded.

Hannibal succeeds to the command of the
army, 221;

and begins the second Punic war,
218.

6. During the nine years in which Hamilcar
commanded, and in the following eight in which
Hasdrubal, his son-in-law and successor, was at
the head of the army, the whole of the south of
Spain, as far as the Iberus, was brought under
subjection to Carthage, either by negotiation or
force of arms. The further progress of the Carthaginians
was only arrested by a treaty with the
Romans, in which the Iberus was fixed upon as
a frontier line, and the freedom of Saguntum acknowledged
by both powers. Hasdrubal crowned
his victories as a general and as a statesman by
the foundation of New Carthage, (Carthagena,)
which was to be the future seat of Carthaginian
power in the newly-conquered country. Hasdrubal
having fallen by the hand of an assassin in
the year 221, the party of the Barcas succeeded
in appointing Hamilcar's son, Hannibal, a young
man of one-and-twenty, for his successor. Hannibal
found every thing already prepared in Spain
for the furtherance of the hereditary project of his
family, which was a renewal of the contest with
Rome; and the vigour with which this project
was pursued, clearly proves how great must have[Pg 85]
been the preponderance of the Barcine influence,
at that time, in Carthage. Had the commonwealth
attended to the marine with the same
ardour as their great general did to the land service,
the fate of Rome would perhaps have been
very different.

Second war with Rome, 218&mdash;201, (seventeen years,) first in
Italy and Spain, afterwards, from 203, in Africa itself. (See
the history of this war below, in the Roman history, Book V, Period
ii, parag. 6 sqq.)

Internal
state of
Carthage
during the
second Punic
war.

7. Until Africa became the scene of action, the
second war cost the republic much less than the
first; the expenses being principally defrayed by
Spain and Italy. Hanno, however, was at the
head of a powerful party at home, who were clamorous
for peace, and who can say they were
wrong? As might be expected, the family of the
Barcas were for war, and their influence carried
the day. That general who, with hardly any support
from Carthage, was yet able to maintain a
footing in the country of his powerful foes for no
less than fifteen years, and that, too, as much by
policy as by force of arms, must extort our admiration.
It cannot, however, be denied, that
during the struggle one favourable opportunity,
at least, was let slip of making peace; a fatal
omission, for which the hero of Cann&aelig; paid
dearly enough, by the failure of his darling project.

A disgraceful
peace the result of the war.

8. By the second peace with Rome, Carthage
was deprived of all her possessions out of Africa,
and her fleet was delivered into the hands of the
Romans. She was now to be a mere trading city
under the tutelage of Rome. But Carthage found
[Pg 86]by this peace her most formidable enemy on the
soil of Africa itself. Massinissa had been elevated
to the dignity of king of Numidia; and his endeavours
to form his nomads into an agricultural
Massinissa of Numidia a new instrument of Roman policy.
people, and to collect them into cities, must have
changed the military system that Carthage had
hitherto followed. Roman policy, moreover, had
taken care that the article inserted in his favour
in the last treaty of peace, should be so ambiguously
worded, as to leave abundant openings for
dispute.

Hannibal at
the head of affairs;

attempts to check the oligarchy.

9. Even after this disgraceful peace, the family
of the Barcas still preserved their influence, and
Hannibal was placed as supreme magistrate at
the head of the republic. He attempts to reform
the constitution and the finances, by destroying
the oligarchy of the hundred, by whom the finances
had been thrown into confusion. Complete as
was the success of the first blow, it soon became
apparent that aristocratic factions are not so readily
annihilated as armies.

The democratic faction to which even the Barcas owed their
first elevation, was the cause of the degeneracy of the Carthaginian
constitution. By that faction the legislative authority of the
senate and magistrates was withdrawn and transferred to the ordo
judicum&mdash;probably the same as the high state tribunal of the
hundred&mdash;which now assumed the character of an omnipotent
national inquisition; and the members being chosen for life exercised
oppressive despotism. This tribunal was formed of those
who had served the office of ministers of finance, with whom it
shared unblushingly the revenues of the state. Hannibal destroyed
this oligarchy by a law, enacting that the members should
hold their office but for one year; whereas before they held it
for life. In the reform wrought by this law in the finances it
was seen, that after all wars and losses, the revenues of the republic
were still sufficient, not only for the usual expenditure[Pg 87]
and the payment of tribute to Rome, but also for leaving a surplus
in the public treasury. Ten years had hardly elapsed before
Carthage was enabled to pay down at once the whole of the
tribute which she had engaged to furnish by instalments.

Hannibal
compelled
to fly to Syria.

10. The defeated party, whose interests were
now the same with those of Rome, joined the Romans,
to whom they discovered Hannibal's plan
of renewing the war in conjunction with Antiochus
the Great, king of Syria. A Roman embassy
was sent over to Africa, under some other pretext,
to demand that Hannibal should be given
up. The Carthaginian general secretly fled to
195.
king Antiochus, at whose court he became the
chief fomenter of the war against Rome; although
unsuccessful in his endeavour to implicate the
Carthaginian republic in the struggle.

See hereafter the history of Syria, Book IV, Period iii, separate
kingdoms. I. Seleucid&aelig;, parag. 18; and Book V, Period
ii, parag. 10 sq.

Roman influence
completely
established
in Carthage.

11. In consequence of the absence of Hannibal,
Carthage fell once more under the dominion of
the Romans, who contrived, by taking a crafty advantage
of the state of parties, to give a show of
generosity to the exercise of their power. Even
the patriotic faction, if we may judge by the violent
steps which they took more than once against
Massinissa and his partisans, seem to have been
but a tool in the hands of Rome.

The Carthaginian
territory
gradually
dismembered.

12. Disputes with Massinissa, which led to the
gradual partition of the Carthaginian territory in
Africa. The manner in which this territory had
been acquired, facilitated the discovery of claims
upon each of the component parts; and the interference
of Rome, sometimes disinterested, but of[Pg 88]tener
swayed by party feeling, ensured the possession
of the territory to the Numidian.

Even in 199, a disadvantageous treaty framed with Massinissa
for fifty years: nevertheless the rich province of Emporia is lost
in 193.&mdash;Loss of another province unnamed, to which Massinissa
inherited some claims from his father.&mdash;Seizure of the province
of Tysca, with fifty cities, about 174. Probable date of Cato's
embassy, who returned in disgust, because his decision had been
rejected, and became the fomenter of a project to destroy Carthage.&mdash;New
disputes about 152.&mdash;Massinissa's party is expelled
Carthage.&mdash;War breaks out in consequence, during which the
king in his ninetieth year personally defeats the Carthaginians;
and what with famine and the sword, Hasdrubal's army, which
had been surrounded by the enemy, was nearly exterminated; in
the mean while the Roman ambassadors, who had come to act as
mediators, obeying their private instructions, looked on with
quiet indifference.

Destruction
of Carthage;
third Punic
war;


13. Though it is evident that the party spirit
raging between Cato and Scipio Nasica had a
considerable influence in hastening the destruction
of Carthage; and though it is equally clear
that Massinissa's late victory paved the way for
the immediate execution of that project; yet it is
difficult to unravel the web, by which, long before
the declaration of war now about to follow,
treachery prepared the final scene of this great
tragedy. Was the account that Cato at his return
gave of the resuscitated power of Carthage consonant
brought about probably by Roman duplicity.
to truth? Was not the sudden secession
of Ariobarzanes, the grandson of Syphax, who
was to have led a Numidian army to defend Carthage
against Massinissa, previously arranged with
Rome? Was not the turbulent Gisgo, who first
incited the populace to insult the Roman ambassadors,
and then opportunely rescued them from
the fury of the mob, in the pay of Rome? These[Pg 89]
questions give rise to suspicions, although they
cannot satisfactorily be answered. At any rate,
it may be said, that the conduct of Rome, after
war had broken out, corroborates the suspicion.
The whole history of the last period sufficiently
proves, that it was not so much the debased character
of the nation, as party spirit, and the avarice
of the great, which produced the fall of Carthage.
Advantage was taken of that party spirit and avarice
by Roman policy, which, although acting according
to the dictates of blind passion, knew
how to profit by dark and base intrigue.

[Pg 90]
SECOND BOOK.


History of the Persian Empire, from B. C. 560&mdash;330.


Sources. Preservation of historic records among the Persians
themselves under the form of royal annals; origin and nature of
those annals. As these have been destroyed, we are obliged to
deduce the history from foreign writers, some of whom, however,
availed themselves of the Persian annals. 1. Greeks: their
authority as writers, contemporary, but not always sufficiently
acquainted with the east. (a) Ctesias. His court history compiled
from Persian annals, would be the principal work did we
possess the whole; we have, however, only an extract from it
preserved by Photius. (b) Herodotus: who probably availed
himself of similar sources in some portion of his work. (c) Xenophon.
To this period of history belong, not only his Anabasis
and Hellenica, but also his Cyrop&aelig;dia, or portraiture of a happy
empire and an accomplished ruler, according to eastern ideas, exhibited
in the example of Cyrus: of use so far as pure historic records
are interwoven with the narrative. (d) Diodorus, etc.
2. Jewish writers. The books of Esdras and Nehemiah; and
more particularly that of Esther, as containing a faithful representation
of the Persian court and its manners. 3. The accounts
of the later Persian chroniclers, Mirkhond in particular, who
flourished in the thirteenth century of the christian era, can have
no weight in the scale of criticism; they are nevertheless interesting,
inasmuch as they make us acquainted with the ideas that
the inhabitants of the east form of their early history.

The modern authors on Persian history are principally those
who have written on ancient history in general: see p. 2. A
treatise on Persian history, deduced from eastern sources, will
be found in the Ancient Universal History, vol. iv.

ages to the present times. Lond. 1816, 4to. 2 vols. "A valuable

Original
condition
of the Persians.


1. State of the Persian nation previous to Cyrus;
a highland people, subject to the Medes,
dwelling in the mountainous parts of the province
of Persis, and leading wholly, or for the most
part, a nomad life. Division into ten clans,
among which that of the Pasargad&aelig;, the noblest
The horde of the Pasargad&aelig;,
and ruling horde, is particularly remarkable on
account of the figure it makes in subsequent history.&mdash;The
result of this division was a patriarchal
government, the vestiges of which remain visible
in the whole of the following history of the Persians.
Permanent distinction between the tribes
in reference to their mode of life, observable even
during the most flourishing period of the Persian
state: three of the nobles or warriors, three of
the husbandmen, and four of the shepherds.
Argument thence deduced, that the history of the
has the ascendant.
Persians as a dominant nation, is that of the
nobler clans alone, and of the Pasargad&aelig; more
especially.

Cyrus,
similar to
Gengis-khan
and other
Asiatic
conquerors;

2. The personal history of Cyrus, the founder
of the Persian monarchy, was, even in the time of
Herodotus, so obscured under the veil of romance,
that it was no longer possible to detect the real
truth. It is, however, evident, that the course of
the revolution wrought by him was, on the whole,
the same as was followed in all similar empires
founded in Asia. Gengis-khan, in a later age,
was placed at the head of all the Mogol hordes;
in the same manner was Cyrus elected chief of
all the Persian tribes, by whose assistance he
founds the Persian empire about B. C. 561.
became a mighty conqueror, at the time that the
Babylonian and Median kingdoms of Inner Asia
were on the decline, and before the Lydian[Pg 92]
empire, under Cr&#339;sus, had been firmly established.

Descent of Cyrus from the family of Ach&aelig;menes, (Jamshid?).
That family belonged to the Pasargad&aelig; tribe, and therefore remained
the ruling house.

Of the Medo-Bactrian empire, destroyed 561.
of the Lydian empire:
Asiatic Greeks subjected, about 557
of Babylon, 538.
Cyrus is slain in battle with the Massaget&aelig;, 529.

3. Rise of the Persian dominion, in consequence
of the overthrow of the Medo-Bactrian
empire, after the defeat of Astyages at Pasargada.
Rapid extension by further conquest. Subjection
of Asia Minor after the victory won by Cyrus in
person over Cr&#339;sus, and capture of the Greek
colonies by the generals of the Persian monarch.
Conquest of Babylon and all the Babylonian provinces.
The Ph&#339;nician cities submit themselves
of their own accord.  Even in Cyrus's time,
therefore, the frontiers of the Persian empire had
been extended in southern Asia to the Mediterranean,
to the Oxus, and to the Indus; but the
campaign against the nomad races, inhabiting the
steppes of Central Asia, was unsuccessful; and
Cyrus himself fell in the contest.

It cannot be denied but that in the narration of the separate
wars waged by Cyrus, discrepancies are found in Herodotus and
Ctesias; those two authors, however, agree in the main facts:
and, indeed, the differences which exist between them cannot be
considered always as direct contradictions.

The Persians
adopt
the religion,
laws, and
civility of
the conquered
Medes.

4. Immediate consequences of this great revolution
in respect both of the conquerors and the
conquered. Among the former, even in the time
of Cyrus, the civilization and luxury of the Medes,
their legislation and national religion, and the
sacerdotal caste of the magi, who were guardians
of that religion, had been introduced, and the
whole system of the Persian court had been remodelled
upon that of the Medes.[Pg 93]

religion, according to the Zend-avesta. How far the
dogmas of Zoroaster can be considered as dominant among the

Expedients adopted to keep possession
of the conquered territories.
Tribute.
Standing armies.
Transfer of whole nations.

5.  First political constitution of the Persian empire under Cyrus. No general new organization;
but for the most part the original institutions are preserved among the conquered, who
are compelled to pay tribute. Royal officers, appointed to collect
the tribute, are associated with the generals, who with numerous armies
keep in subjection the inhabitants of the conquered
countries. For the support of the empire
large standing armies are kept in pay, besides
which, recourse is frequently had to the transplanting
of whole nations; while, as was the case
with the Jews, some who had been formerly transplanted
are restored to their country. With the
same view injunctions are issued, as in the case
of the Lydians, to effect the enervation of warlike
races by a luxurious and effeminate system of
education.

6.  Cyrus leaves two sons, the elder of whom,[Pg 94]
Cambyses, succeeds as king; the younger, Smerdis,
(the Tanyoxarces of Ctesias,) becomes independent
lord of Bactria and the eastern territories;
but is soon after murdered by the command
of his elder brother.

Cambyses
529&mdash;522.
conquers
Egypt, etc.

7. Under Cambyses the conquering arms of
the Persians are directed against Africa. Egypt
becomes a Persian province, and the neighbouring
Libya, together with Cyrene, assume the yoke of
their own accord. But the twofold expedition
against the opulent commercial establishments,
Ammonium in the west, and Meroe in the south,
is wholly unsuccessful; that against Carthage is
arrested in its commencement by the refusal of
the Tyrians to join the naval armament. A colony
of six thousand Egyptians is transplanted into
Susiana.

His policy
in persecuting
the Egyptian priesthood:
his vices probably much exaggerated.

8. The cruelty with which Cambyses is accused
of treating the Egyptians was directed
rather against the powerful caste of the priests,
than against the whole nation; and originated
more in political than in religious motives. It
must be observed, however, that we ought to be
particularly on our guard against all the evil that
is related of Cambyses, inasmuch as our information
respecting that prince is derived entirely from
his enemies, the Egyptian priests.

Usurpation of the magi:
death of Cambyses, 522.

9. The usurpation of the Pseudo-Smerdis, (or
Tanyoxarces,) was an attempt of the magi to replace
a Median dynasty on the throne, by means
of a plot hatched within the seraglio. It was the
occasion of an accident which cost Cambyses his
life, after a reign of seven years and a half: (or,
according to Ctesias, of eighteen.)

[Pg 95]
The false
Smerdis,
after a reign
of eight
months, is
slain by the
seven grandees.

10. The Pseudo-Smerdis kept his seat on the
throne eight months, during which he attempted
to bring over the conquered nations to his interest
by a remission of all tribute for three years; but
the discovery of his cheat gave rise to a conspiracy
of seven of the chief Persians, who could
not brook the rule of a Mede, and the usurper lost
his life.

No progress made towards an established
government under Cambyses and Smerdis.

The Persians having forsaken the nomad life,

Persepolis is built.

11. It could not be expected that the political
organization of the kingdom should advance to
completion during the reign of Cambyses, who
was almost always absent in the prosecution of
war; or during the brief rule of the Pseudo-Smerdis.
It remained, therefore, in the same
state as under Cyrus. But the introduction of
the Median court-ceremonial among the ruling
tribe of the Persians, and the adoption of fixed
dwellings by that tribe, rendered it necessary that
royal residences should be erected for the reception
of the king's court; among these Persepolis,
(see above, p. 20,) probably commenced by Cyrus,
was completed under Darius and Xerxes.

The best drawings of the monuments of Persepolis, remarkable
alike for their architecture, their sculpture, and their inscriptions
in the arrow-headed character, are to be found in the Travels of
Chardin and Niebuhr. Illustrations:

The seven
grandees
hold council
on the future
form of
government.

12. After a very remarkable debate held by
the seven conspirators, concerning the form of
of government which should be established, Darius,
the son of Hystaspes, one of the family of the
Ach&aelig;menides, was raised to the throne by an
oracle; this king endeavoured to strengthen his
right to the sceptre by marrying two of Cyrus's
daughters.


Darius
(522&mdash;486.)
a great
statesman
and conqueror:

13. The reign of Darius I. which lasted thirty-six
years, (according to Ctesias 31,) is remarkable
for the improvements made both in the external
and internal administration of the Persian empire.
In the former, by the great expeditions and conquests,
which extended the Persian realm to its
utmost limits; in the latter, by several important
institutions, established for the internal organization
of the state.


the first
Persian
that carries
his arms
into Europe:
and is embroiled with the European Greeks.


14. The expeditions of the Persians under Cyrus
were directed against the countries of Asia;
those of Cambyses against Africa. But those
undertaken by Darius I. were directed against
Europe, though the Persian territory was at the
same time extended in the two other quarters of
the world. In the reign of this king likewise
commenced those wars with the Greeks, so fatal
to the Persians; constantly fomented and supported
by emigrant or exile Greeks, who found
an asylum in the Persian court, and there contrived
to raise a party.&mdash;First example of the kind
exhibited shortly after the accession of Darius, in[Pg 97]
the case of Syloson, brother to Polycrates, who
had been tyrant of Samos: at his request the
island was taken possession of by the Persians,
and delivered up to him after the almost total destruction
of the male population.


Babylon secedes,
and
is reduced:
516.

15.  Great revolt in Babylon, which would not
submit tamely to a foreign yoke. After a siege
of twenty-one months, Darius by stratagem regains
possession of the city. The power of
Babylon and the importance of its situation increased
the jealousy with which it was guarded
by the Persian kings; so much so, that they
were wont to reside there a certain portion of the
year.


Campaign against the Scythians: 513.
The Persians, though unsuccessful, establish themselves in Europe.

16.  First great expedition of Darius undertaken
against the Scythians inhabiting the lands north
of the Black sea: the former irruption of the
Scythians into Asia afforded a pretext for the
war, which, therefore, was considered as a general
national undertaking. Unsuccessful as the
Persian arms were in this vast expedition against
the Scythians, and disgraceful as was the retreat
from the barren steppes of the Ukrain, yet the
power of Darius was established in Thrace and
Macedonia, and the Persians obtained firm footing
in Europe.

Concerning the peculiar character of the Persian national wars,
or great campaigns, in which all the conquered nations were
obliged to participate, contrasted with the other wars waged by
Persian troops alone.


Campaign against western India, 509:


17.  The next expedition made by Darius was
more successful. It was carried on along the
banks of the Indus, down which river Scylax, a
Greek, had previously sailed on a voyage of
discovery. The highlands north of the Indus
[Pg 98]were then subjected to the Persian dominion,
and the Indus became the boundary of the
kingdom.  About the same time that Darius
was engaged on the Danube and the Indus,
Aryandes, his viceroy in Egypt, led an expedition against
against Barca in Africa.
Barca, to avenge the murder of king
Arcesilaus; a war which terminated in the destruction
of the city, and the transplantation of
its inhabitants into Asia.

Secession of the Asiatic Greeks, 502&mdash;496;
who, assisted by Athens, fire Sardes, 500,
but are completely routed off Miletus, 496.

18. However trifling the first occurrence which
gave rise to the revolt of the Asiatic Greeks,
it was much more important in its consequences.
It was set on foot by Aristagoras, lieutenant-governor
of Miletus, who was secretly supported
by his relation, the offended Histi&aelig;us,
then resident at the Persian court. The share
taken by the Athenians in this rebellion, which
led to the burning of Sardes, was the origin of the
national hatred between Persia and European
Greece, and of the long series of wars that ensued.
The confederates were this time defeated;
but the naval battle off the island of Lada, could
hardly have had such a fatal result, had not the
league been previously corrupted by the craft and
gold of Persia. Be that as it may, this war
ended in the reduction of the Ionians, and the
destruction of Miletus, their flourishing capital; a
city which in those days, together with Tyre and
Carthage, engrossed the trade of the world.

First campaign against Greece.
under Mardonius, frustrated by a tempest off Athos, 492.
Second campaign.
Battle of Marathon, Sept. 29, 490.

19. First attack upon Greece, particularly
Athens. Darius, already enraged against the
Athenians by the firing of Sardes, is still further
instigated by the suggestions of the banished tyrant
of Athens, Hippias, the son of Pisistratus.
[Pg 99]
This prince, who had fled to the Persian court,
was evidently the animating spirit of the whole
undertaking. Although the first attempt, made
under the command of Mardonius, was thwarted
by a tempest, yet the mighty expedition which
afterwards followed, was undertaken with so much
more prudence, and conducted with so much
knowledge of the country, that no one can fail to
recognize the guiding hand of Hippias. Even the
battle of Marathon, which seems to have been
but a diversion on the side of the Persians, would
not have decided the war, had not the activity of
Miltiades defeated the principal design of the
enemy upon Athens.


Progress of
the Persians
towards a
regular
constitution.

20. It may be said that Darius, by these foreign
wars, debilitated the kingdom which he endeavoured
to extend; this circumstance, however,
it cannot be denied, increases the merit which he
has of perfecting the internal organization of the
empire. His reign constitutes precisely that period
which must enter into the history of every
nomad race that has attained to power, and is
advancing towards political civilization; a period
at which it becomes visible that the nation is endeavouring
to obtain a constitution, however gradual
the progress towards it.


Division of
the empire
into satrapies.

21. Division of the empire into twenty satrapies,
and the imposition of a regular tribute on
each. This division at first depended solely on
that of the various tributary races, but from it
gradually arose a geographic division, in which
the ancient distinction of countries was for the
most part preserved.

[Pg 100]
Proofs that the division into satrapies was originally a mere
arrangement for the civil government and collection of taxes,
distinct from military power. Duties of the satraps. The attention
they were to pay to the cultivation and improvement of
the land; to the collection of the imposts; to the execution of
the royal commands relating to provincial affairs. An abuse of
this institution, at a later period, placed in the hands of these
satraps the command also of the troops.&mdash;Various means of keeping
the satraps in a state of dependence: royal secretaries appointed
for each, who were to be the first to receive the king's
commands.&mdash;Periodical visits paid to the provinces by commissioners
under the direct appointment of the king, or by the king
himself accompanied with an army.&mdash;Establishment of couriers
in every part of the empire, for the purpose of securing a safe
and rapid communication with the provinces, as was the case
also in the Mongol countries; (not a regular post, however, the
institution here alluded to being intended only for the court.)


Persian
finances:
the conquered
to
support the
conquerors.

22. The Persian finance continues to preserve
those peculiarities which naturally result from the
formation of an empire by a nomad race of conquerors,
desirous of living at the expense of the
conquered, and under a despotic form of government.

Collection of tribute, mostly in kind, for the support of the
court and the armies; and in precious metals, not coined, but in
their raw state. Application of the treasure thus collected towards
constituting a private chest for the king. Various other
royal imposts.&mdash;Mode of providing for the public expenditure by
assignments on the revenues of one or several places.


Art military.

23. Organization of the military system, conformably
to the primitive state of the nation, and
the necessity now felt of keeping the conquered
countries in subjection by means of standing armies.

Military organization of the Persian nations, by means of a
decimal division pervading the whole.&mdash;Royal troops cantoned in
the open field, according to a certain division of the empire, or
stationed as garrisons in the cities, and distinct from the encampments.&mdash;Manner
in which the troops were supported at the cost
and by the taxes of the provinces.&mdash;Introduction of mercenaries[Pg 101]
and Greeks, more particularly among the Persians, and fatal consequences
of that measure. Military household of the satraps
and grandees.&mdash;Institution of a general conscription in national
wars. Formation of the Persian navy, consisting of the Ph&#339;nician,
and not unfrequently of the Asiatic Greek fleets.


The Persian
court both a
seraglio and
the head
quarters of
the army.

24.  From the time of Darius, the court of the
kings of Persia attained its complete form, and
the government soon after was wholly concentrated
in the seraglio. Yet the mode of life which
the kings led, surrounded by a court, taken principally
if not wholly from the tribe of the Pasargad&aelig;,
and changing their residence according to
the revolutions of the seasons, still preserved the
traces of nomad origin.

Babylon, Susa, and Ecbatana, the usual residences; Persepolis
now used as a royal cemetery. The court supported by the
most costly productions of each province; hence arose the rigid
ceremonial observed at the royal table.&mdash;Internal organization of
the seraglio.&mdash;Influence of the eunuchs and queen-mothers on
the government.


Revolt of Egypt, 488:
death of Darius, 486.

25.  Already had Darius commenced preparations
to wreak his vengeance on Athens, when a
revolution broke out in Egypt, and hindered him
from prosecuting his design. He died after nominating
for his successor Xerxes I. grandson of
Cyrus, and his eldest son by a second wife,
Atossa, whose influence over her husband was
boundless.


Xerxes I. 486&mdash;465:
recovers Egypt, 484:

26. Xerxes I. A prince educated in the seraglio,
who knew nothing beyond the art of representing
the pomp of royalty.  Subjection of
Egypt, and severe treatment of that country under
the satrap Ach&aelig;menes, brother to Xerxes.

leads a
mighty
army
against
Greece.

27. Xerxes' famous expedition against Greece
was again the result of the cabals and intrigues of
the Greek exiles, the Pisistratid&aelig;, the soothsayer
[Pg 102]Onomacritus, the Thessalian princes or Aleuad&aelig;,
who contrived to exert their influence on the
king's mind, and to raise a party in their favour
among the grandees. But the progress of the
campaign showed that no Hippias was at the
head of the invading army, although the Persian
king did certainly succeed in his avowed object,
the capture and destruction of Athens.

Critique on the detailed account given by Herodotus of this
expedition, as a national undertaking in which all the subjugated
nations were obliged to take a share.&mdash;Preparations which last
for three years in the Persian empire; league framed with Carthage
for the subjection of the Sicilian Greeks, 483&mdash;481. The
expedition itself in 480; over Asia Minor and the Hellespont,
through Thrace and Macedonia.&mdash;Muster of the army and division
of the troops according to nations at Doriscus; the detailed
description of which found in Herodotus, was most probably borrowed
from some Persian document.&mdash;The pass of Thermopyl&aelig;
taken by treachery; on the same day a naval engagement off
Artemisium.&mdash;Athens captured and burnt. Battle of Salamis,
Sept. 23, 480. Retreat of Xerxes; an army of picked men left
behind, under the command of Mardonius.&mdash;Fruitless negotiations
with the Athenians.&mdash;Second campaign of Mardonius: he
is routed at Plat&aelig;&aelig;, Sept. 25, 479; and that event puts an end
for ever to the Persian irruptions into Greece: on the same day
the Persian army is defeated, and their fleet burnt at Mycale in
Asia Minor.


Persia now
obliged to
concentrate
her forces in
Asia Minor.

28. The consequences of these repeated and
unsuccessful expeditions, in which almost the
whole population was engaged, must be self-evident.
The empire was weakened and depopulated.
The defensive war which the Persians for
thirty years were obliged to maintain against the
Greeks, who aimed at establishing the independence
of their Asiatic countrymen, completely
destroyed the balance of their power, by compelling
them to transfer their forces to Asia[Pg 103]
Minor, the most distant western province of the
empire.


Policy of
the Persians
in bribing
the Greeks.
Cimon wrests from Persia the sovereignty of the sea:
battle of the Eurymedon, 469.

29. Little as the Greeks had to fear from the
Persian arms, the danger with which they were
now threatened was much more formidable, when
the enemy began to adopt the system of bribing
the chieftains of Greece; a system which succeeded
beyond expectation in the first trial made
of it with Pausanias, and perhaps was not wholly
unsuccessful with Themistocles himself.&mdash;But the
Persians soon found in Cimon an adversary who
deprived them of the sovereignty of the sea; who
in one day destroyed both their fleet and their
army on the Eurymedon; and by the conquest of
the Thracian Chersonese, wrested from them the
key of Europe.


Bloody deeds in the Persian seraglio:
Xerxes murdered.

30.  What little we know further concerning the
reign of Xerxes, consists in the intrigues of the
seraglio, which now, through the machinations of
queen Amestris, became the theatre of all those
horrors which are wont to be exhibited in such
places, and to which Xerxes himself at last fell a
victim, in consequence of the conspiracy of Artabanes
and the eunuch Spamitres.

Was Xerxes the Ahasuerus of the Jews?&mdash;On the difference
between the names of the Persian kings in Persian and Chaldee;
not to be wondered at when we consider that they were mere
titles or surnames, assumed by the sovereigns after their accession.


Artaxerxes, 465&mdash;424.
during his reign Persia is on the decline.

31.  Artaxerxes I. surnamed Longimanus. In
consequence of the murder of his father and his
elder brother, in the conspiracy of Artabanes, this
prince ascended the throne, but was unable to
keep possession of the sceptre without assassi[Pg 104]nating,
in his turn, Artabanes. His reign, which
lasted forty years, exhibits the first symptoms of
the decline of the empire, which this king, although
possessed of many good qualities, had not
the talent or spirit to arrest.


Rebellions
in the provinces.

32. At the very commencement of his reign
rebellions are excited in the provinces; in the
mean while the war with Athens continues. Two
battles are required to repress the insurrection of
his brother Hystaspes in Bactria.


Second secession of Egypt, 463:

33. Second revolt of Egypt, excited by the
Libyan king, Inarus of Marea, in conjunction
with the Egyptian, Amyrt&aelig;us, and supported by
an Athenian fleet. Although the confederates
did not make themselves masters of Memphis,
they defeated the Persian army, commanded by
the king's brother, Ach&aelig;menes, who lost his life
in the battle; they were at last overpowered by
Megabyzus, satrap of Syria, and shut up together
with Inarus in the town of Byblus. Inarus and
partly quelled, 456.
his party were admitted to capitulation; but
Amyrt&aelig;us, having taken refuge in the morasses,
continued to make head against the Persians.


Persian fleet and
army defeated by Cimon, 449.

Disgraceful peace with Athens, 449.

34. The Grecian war takes, once more, an unfavourable
turn for the Persians: Cimon defeats
the enemy's fleet and army near Cyprus. The
fear of losing the whole of the island accordingly
compels Artaxerxes I. to sign a treaty of peace
with Athens, in which he recognizes the independence
of the Asiatic Greeks, and agrees that
his fleet shall not navigate the &AElig;g&aelig;an sea, nor
his troops approach within three days' march of
the coast.

Megabyzus,
the first example
of a
rebellious
satrap,
447.

35. But the haughty and powerful Megabyzus,
[Pg 105]enraged at the execution of Inarus, in violation of
the promise made by him to that prince, excites
a rebellion in Syria; repeatedly defeats the royal
armies, and prescribes himself the conditions upon
which he will be reconciled to his sovereign.
This was the first great example of a successful
insurrection excited by one of the Persian satraps;
and chequered as were the subsequent
fortunes of Megabyzus, his party continued to
subsist after his death in the persons of his sons.
He possessed in the centre of the court a support
in the dowager queen Amestris, and the reigning
Death of Artaxerxes, 424.
queen Amytis; (both notorious for their excesses;)
who kept Artaxerxes I. in a constant state of tutelage
to the hour of his death.


Xerxes
II. 424.

36.  Revolutions in the government now succeed each other with rapidity and violence.
Xerxes II. the only legitimate son and successor of Artaxerxes, is slain, after forty-five days' reign,
by his bastard brother
Sogdianus.
Sogdianus; the latter, in his turn, after a reign of six months, is deposed
by another bastard brother, Ochus, who ascends the throne, and assumes the name of Darius II.


Darius II. 423&mdash;404.
Rapid decline of the state.

37.  Darius II. surnamed the Bastard, or Nothus.
He reigns nineteen years under the tutelage
of his wife, Parysatis, and of three eunuchs,
one of whom, Artoxares, even attempts to open a
way to the throne, but is put to death. In this
period the decline of the state advances with hurried
steps; partly by reason of the extinction of
the legitimate royal line, partly by the increased
practice of placing more than one province, together
with the military command, in the hands of
the same satrap. Although the repeated insur[Pg 106]rections
of the satraps are repressed, the court,
by the breach of faith to which it is obliged to
have recourse, in order to succeed in its measures,
422.
exhibits to the world a convincing proof of its infirmity.
The revolt of Arsites, one of the king's
brothers, who was supported by a son of Megabyzus,
and that of Pisuthnes, satrap of Lydia, are
quelled only by obtaining treacherous possession of their

persons.


38. In consequence of the weak state of the
empire, the fire, which had hitherto been smouldering
under the ashes, burst forth in Egypt.
Amyrt&aelig;us, who had remained till now in the morasses,
issued forth, supported by the Egyptians;

and the Persians were again expelled the land.
Obscure as the subsequent history may be, we
see that the Persians were obliged to acknowledge,
not only Amyrt&aelig;us, but his successors.
[See page 72].


Peloponnesian
war favorable
to
the Persian
interests.

39. The Persians must have regarded it as a
happy event, that the Peloponnesian war, kindled
in Greece during the reign of Artaxerxes, and
protracted through the whole of that of Darius II.
had prevented the Greeks from unitedly falling
upon Persia. It now became, and henceforward
continued to be, the chief policy of the Persians
to foment quarrels and wars between the Grecian
republics, by siding at various times with various
parties; and the mutual hatred of the Greeks
rendered this game so easy, that Greece could
hardly have escaped total destruction, had the
Persian plans been always as wisely laid as they
were by Tissaphernes; and had not the caprice
and jealousy of the satraps in Asia Minor gene[Pg 107]rally
had more effect than the commands of the court.

Alliance of the Persians with Sparta, framed by Tissaphernes,
441; but in consequence of the policy of Alcibiades, and the
artful principles of Tissaphernes, followed by no important results,
until the younger Cyrus, satrap of all Asia Minor, was by
Lysander, 407, brought over to the Spartan interest. (See below,
the Grecian history, III. Period, parag. 23.)


Artaxerxes II.
405&mdash;362.

40.  Artaxerxes II. surnamed Mnemon. Although
this prince was the eldest son of Darius,
his right to the throne might, according to the
Persian ideas of succession, have appeared dubious,
since his younger brother, Cyrus, had the
advantage over him of being the first born subsequent
to the accession of his father.
Anabasis of Cyrus.
Relying on the support of his mother Parysatis, Cyrus,
even without this claim to the throne, would, no
doubt, have asserted his pretence to the sovereign
power. It would have been, in all probability, a
fortunate event for the Persian empire, had the
fate of battle, in the ensuing war between the two
brothers, assigned the throne to him whom nature
seems to have pointed out as the fittest person.

History of this war according to Xenophon. Battle of Cunaxa,
in which Cyrus falls, 401. Retreat of the ten thousand Greek
mercenaries in the service of Cyrus, under the guidance of Xenophon.


Weak reign of Artaxerxes II.

41.  During the whole of this reign, Artaxerxes,
now firmly seated on the throne, remained under
the tutelage of his mother, Parysatis, whose inveterate
hatred against his wife, Statira, and
against all who had any share in the death of her
darling son, Cyrus, converted the seraglio into a
theatre of bloody deeds, such as can be conceived
and committed only in similar places.
[Pg 108]

War with Sparta, 400.
Agesilaus in Asia, 396&mdash;394.
Peace of Antalcidas, 387.
Policy of Persia in keeping on good terms with Thebes.
War with Evagoras of Cyprus, 385.

42. The insurrection and rout of Cyrus produced
a corresponding change in the political relations
between the Persian court and Sparta:
which, however, were now determined, not so
much by the will of the monarch himself, as by
the satraps of Asia Minor, Tissaphernes and Pharnabazus,
of whose jealousy Sparta knew how to
take advantage. The former, by his severity towards
the Asiatic Greeks, who had supported the
cause of Cyrus, excited a war with Sparta, in
which he himself fell a victim. The death of the
satrap is not, however, succeeded by tranquillity;
for Agesilaus commands in Asia, and threatens to
overthrow the Persian throne itself. The policy
of the Persians is shown by the war which they
foment in Greece against Sparta: Conon is placed
at the head of their fleet, and extricates Persia
from her difficulties better than could have been
done by her own generals;
in the peace of Antalcidas she herself dictates the terms, by which
the Grecian colonies of Asia Minor, together with
Cyprus and Clazomen&aelig;, are again delivered into
her possession.  The rising power of Thebes
under Epaminondas and Pelopidas, with whom
Persia keeps up a friendly connection, ensures
her from any future blow at the hands of the
Spartans.&mdash;War for the possession of Cyprus with
Evagoras, who, however, by the subsequent peace
retains the sovereignty of Salamis.


War with the Cadusii, 384.
Attempt to recover Egypt, 374.

43. The war against the Cadusii in the mountains
of Caucasus, proves that Artaxerxes II. was
not fitted for military command; and his attempt
to recover Egypt from king Nectanebus I. which
was defeated by the feud between Iphicrates[Pg 109]
and Artabazus, evinces that the most numerous
Persian host could achieve nothing without the
assistance of Grecian troops and Grecian generals.&mdash;It
could hardly be expected that an empire
should endure much longer, when in the court all
was ruled by the desire of revenge in the women;
when the political organization was already so
corrupt, that the satraps waged war against each
other; and when those generals who gave any
proof of talent received no better reward than
that of Datames.


The succession
to the
throne of
Persia is
disputed
and almost
produces
the downfal
of the empire
before
the death of
Artaxerxes.
Rebellion in the west dispelled by treachery, 362.

44. In fact, it seemed not unlikely that the
Persian empire would fall asunder a little before
the death of Artaxerxes Mnemon. A quarrel
about the succession arose in the court between
the three legitimate sons of the king, the eldest
of whom, Darius, was put to death: the standard
of rebellion was erected in the western half of the
empire, and joined by all the governors of Asia
Minor and Syria, supported by Tachos, king of
Egypt, to whose assistance the Spartans had sent
Agesilaus. The insurrection, however, was quelled
in consequence of the treachery of the chief leader,
Orontes, who was bribed over to the court.


Artaxerxes
III. about 362&mdash;338.
contemporary with Philip, the father of Alexander the Great.

45. In the midst of these commotions died Artaxerxes II.: his youngest son,
Ochus, took possession of the throne, and assumed the name of Artaxerxes III.
This king conceived that he could not establish his power but by the total
destruction of the royal family, numerous as it was. He was
contemporary with Philip of Macedon, in whom he soon found a more formidable
rival than any he could have met with in his own family.

[Pg 110]

Insurrection
in Asia
Minor,
358.

46. The new insurrection fomented by Artabazus
in Asia Minor, was accompanied with success
so long as it was backed by the Thebans;
but the reception which Artabazus met
with at the hands of Philip soon betrayed the
secret intentions of the Macedonian king.


Rebellion
of the Ph&#339;nicians
and
Cyprians,
356.

47. But the extensive rebellion of the Ph&#339;nicians
and Cyprians, in conjunction with Egypt,
compelled the king to undertake another expedition,
which succeeded almost beyond expectation;
although in this case the object was again
attained principally by treachery and by Grecian
auxiliaries.

Treachery of Mentor, the leader of the confederates: the consequent
capture and destruction of Sidon, followed by the subjection
of Ph&#339;nicia, 356. Capture of Cyprus by Grecian troops,
under the command of Phocion and the younger Evagoras, 354.
Expedition of the king in person against Egypt: victory of Pelusium,
won over king Nectanebus II. with the help of Grecian
mercenaries. Egypt becomes, once more, a Persian province.


The Persian empire once more
restored to its ancient bounds.

The king poisoned by the eunuch Bagoas,

48. This restoration of the empire to its former
limits was followed by a period of tranquillity,
the result of force, as Mentor and the eunuch Bagoas,
holding the king in complete dependence,
divided the kingdom, as it were, between themselves;
until Bagoas was pleased, by poison, to
remove Artaxerxes out of his way.


Bagoas
places Arces
on the
throne, but
soon after
makes away
with him.
336.

49. After the assassination of the royal family,
Bagoas placed on the throne the king's youngest
and only surviving son, Arces. Bagoas was desirous
of reigning in the name of that prince; but
after the lapse of two years, he found it necessary
to depose him, and to substitute in his place a
distant relation of the reigning family, Darius[Pg 111]
Codomannus, who commenced his reign by putting
to death the wretch himself.


Darius III. 336.
His kingdom invaded by Alexander the Great, 334.

50. Darius III. Codomannus, not having been educated, like his predecessors,
in the seraglio, gave proof of virtues which entitled him to a better fate.
Attacked in the second year of his
reign by Macedon, against which Persia had

HISTORY OF THE GRECIAN STATES.



Geographical Outline.


Boundaries of Greece:

Greece is bounded on the north by the Cambunian
mountains, which separate it from Macedonia;
on the south and east by the &AElig;g&aelig;an, on
the west by the Ionian sea.
its dimensions:
Greatest length from south to north = 220 geog. miles, greatest breadth
from west to east, = 140 geog. miles. Superficial
contents, = 29,600 square miles.&mdash;Principal
rivers:
rivers: the Peneus, which discharges its waters
into the &AElig;g&aelig;an, and the Achelous, which flows
into the Ionian sea. Advantages in respect to
fertility, resulting from the mildness of the climate,
physical advantages.
between 37&mdash;40&deg; N. lat.; from the number
of small streams; from the qualities and variety
of the soil, in which this country has been so
much more blessed by nature than any other of
similar extent, that every branch of cultivation
may be prosecuted equally and in conjunction.&mdash;Advantages
in reference to navigation and commerce:
situated in the vicinity of the three
quarters of the world, on three sides washed by
the sea, and by reason of its irregular, indented
coast, abounding with commodious ports and
havens.

Divisions.

It may be divided into Northern Greece, from
the north boundary to the chain of &#338;ta and
Pindus, between the Ambracian gulf west, and[Pg 113]
the Maliac east. Central Greece, or Hellas, down
to the isthmus of Corinth: and the southern peninsula,
or Peloponnesus.

Northern
Greece.

Northern Greece comprises two countries;
Thessaly east, Epirus west.

Thessaly.

1.  Thessaly, the largest and one of the most
fruitful of the Grecian countries. Length from
north to south 60 geog. miles; breadth from west
to east 64 geog. miles. Rivers: the Peneus, Apidanus,
and several smaller streams. Mountains:
Olympus, residence of the fabulous gods, and
Ossa in the north; the chain of &#338;ta, Othrys, and
Pindus in the south. Division into five provinces:
1. Esti&aelig;otis; cities: Gomphi, Azorus:
2. Pelasgiotis; cities: Larissa, Gonni, the vale
of Tempe: 3. Thessaliotis; cities: Pharsalus,
etc. 4. Phthiotis; cities: Pher&aelig;, etc. 5. The
foreland of Magnesia, with a city of the same
name. Other territories, such as Perrh&aelig;bia, etc.
for instance, derived their names from the non-Greek
races who inhabited them.

Epirus.

2.  Epirus. Next to Thessaly, the largest, although
one of the least cultivated countries of
Greece: 48&mdash;60 geog. miles long, and the same
in breadth. Divisions: Molossis; city, Ambracia:
Thesprotia; city, Buthrotum; in the interior,
Dodona.

Central
Greece.

Central Greece, or Hellas, comprises nine
countries.

Attica.

1. Attica, a foreland, extending towards the
south-east, and gradually diminishing. Length,
60 geog. miles; greatest breadth, 24 geog. miles.

and Munychius; in the other parts no
towns, but hamlets, &#948;&#942;&#956;&#959;&#953;, such as Marathon, Eleusis,
Decelea, etc.

Megaris.

2. Megaris, close to the isthmus of Corinth.

countries, that which contained the greatest number
of cities, each having its own separate territory.
Among these, the first in importance, and
frequently mistress of the rest, was Thebes on the
Ismenus. The others, Plat&aelig;&aelig;, Tanagra, Thespi&aelig;,
Ch&aelig;ronea, Lebadea, Leuctra, and Orchomenus,
are all celebrated in Grecian history.

FIRST PERIOD.

The most ancient traditional history, down to the Trojan
war, about B. C. 1200.


Sources: On the formation and progress of history among the
Greeks. Preliminary enquiry into the peculiarities of Grecian
mythology in a historical point of view, as comprising the most
ancient history of the national tribes and heroes. A history rich
in itself, on account of the number of tribes and their leaders;
but embellished and altered in various ways by the poets, particularly
the great early epic writers, and afterwards by the tragedians.&mdash;First
advance of history from tradition, wrought by the
logographi, especially those of the Ionian cities, Hecat&aelig;us, Pherecydes,
etc. until Herodotus, so justly called the Father of History,
raised it at once to such a lofty pitch of eminence. (Compare
&#8224; The historical Art of the Greeks considered in its Rise and Progress,
by G. F. Creuzer; 1803.) Nevertheless, in Herodotus,
and even later writers, history continued to savour of its origin;
and so far as the realm of tradition extended, even Theopompus
and Ephorus felt no disinclination to borrow their materials from
mythologists or poets. It need scarcely be observed, that in this
first period the history is merely traditional.

Among the moderns, the English have most successfully treated
the subject of Grecian history: the principal works are:

John Gillies, The History of Ancient Greece, its colonies
and conquests, from the earliest accounts till the division of the
Macedonian empire in the east, including the history of literature,
philosophy, and the fine arts. London, 1786, 2 vols. 4to. and

William Mitford, The History of Greece. London, 1784,[Pg 119]
4 vols. 4to. Several new editions have since appeared. Translated
into German, Jena, 1800, sqq. by H. L. Eichst&auml;dt. Mitford
is perhaps superior in learning, copiousness, and solidity,
but he certainly is greatly surpassed by Gillies in genius and taste,
and more especially in a proper conception of the spirit of antiquity.

Early inhabitants of Greece.

1. Although Greece was originally inhabited
by several insignificant races, two principal tribes
claim our attention, the Pelasgi and the Hellenes.
Both probably were of Asiatic origin; but the
difference of their language characterized them as different tribes.
Pelasgi.
The Pelasgi were the first that extended their dominion in Greece.

First seat of the Pelasgians in the Peloponnesus, under Inachus,
about B. C. 1800. According to their own traditions, they
made their first appearance in this quarter as uncultivated savages;
they must, however, at an early period, have made some
progress towards civilization, since the most ancient states, Argos
and Sicyon, owed their origin to them; and to them, perhaps,
with great probability, are attributed the remains of those most
ancient monuments generally termed cyclopian.&mdash;Extension of
this tribe towards the north, particularly over Attica; settlement
in Thessaly under their leaders Ach&aelig;us, Phthius, and Pelasgus;
here they learned to apply themselves to agriculture, and re[Pg 120]mained
for a hundred and fifty successive years; about 1700&mdash;1500.

Hellenes:

2. The Hellenes,&mdash;subsequently so called from
Hellen, one of their chieftains,&mdash;originally the
weaker of the two tribes, make their first appearance
in Phocis, near Parnassus, under king Deucalion;
from whence they are driven by a flood.
descend southward, about B. C. 1550.
They migrate into Thessaly, and drive out the
Pelasgi from that territory.&mdash;The Hellenes soon
after this become the most powerful race; and
spreading over Greece, expel the Pelasgi from
almost every part. The latter tribe maintain their
and obtain the ascendant
ground only in Arcadia, and the land of Dodona;
some of them migrate to Italy, others to Crete,
and various islands.

Hellenic
tribes.

3. The Hellenic tribe is subdivided into four
principal branches, the &AElig;olians, Ionians, Dorians,
and Ach&aelig;ans, which continue afterwards to be
distinguished and separated by many peculiarities
of speech, customs, and political government.
These four tribes, although they must not be considered
as comprising all the slender ramifications
of the nation, are derived by tradition from Deucalion's
immediate posterity; with whose personal
history, therefore, the history of the tribes
themselves and their migrations is interwoven.

This derivation of the tribes will be better understood by an
inspection of the following genealogical table:




  
  DEUCALION.
  



  
  HELLEN.
  




  DORUS.
  
  XUTHUS.
  
  &AElig;OLUS.




  DORIANS.
  ACH&AElig;US.
  
  ION.
  &AElig;OLIANS.



  
  ACH&AElig;ANS.
  
  IONIANS.
  



[Pg 121]

4. The gradual spread of the various branches
of the Hellenic tribe over Greece was effected by
several migrations, between B. C. 1500&mdash;1300;
after which they preserved the settlements they
had already obtained until the later migration of
the Dorians and Heraclid&aelig;, about 1100.

Principal data for the history of the separate tribes in
this period.


1. &AElig;olus follows his father Hellen into Phthiotis, which consequently
remains the seat of the &AElig;olians; they spread from
thence over western Greece, Acarnania, &AElig;tolia, Phocis, Locris,
Elis in the Peloponnesus, and likewise over the western islands.

2. Dorus follows his father into Esti&aelig;otis, the most ancient
seat of the Dorians. They are driven from thence after the
death of Dorus by the Perrh&aelig;bi; spread over Macedonia and
Crete; part of the tribe return, cross mount &#338;ta, and settle
in the Tetrapolis Dorica, afterwards called Doris, where they
remain until they migrate into Peloponnesus, under the guidance
of the Heraclid&aelig;; about 1100. (See below, p. 127).

3. Xuthus, expelled by his brothers, migrates to Athens,
where he marries Creusa, daughter of Erectheus, by whom he
has sons, Ion and Ach&aelig;us. Ion and his tribe, driven out of
Athens, settle in that part of Peloponnesus called &AElig;gialus, a
name which by them was converted into Ionia, and in later times
exchanged for Achaia. The Ach&aelig;ans preserve their footing in
Laconia and Argos, until the time of the Dorian migration.

original views and conjectures, beyond which the early history
of nations seldom extends.

and Cities, 1820, vol. 1. containing, Orchomenus and the Miny&aelig;;
vols. 2, 3, containing the Dorians, 1825.


Colonies
settle in
Greece.

5. Besides these original inhabitants, colonies
at the same early period came into Greece from
civilized countries, from Egypt, Ph&#339;nicia, and[Pg 122]
Mysia. The settlements of these strangers occurred
probably between B. C. 1600&mdash;1400.

Establishment in Attica of the colony of Cecrops, from Sais in
Egypt, about 1550; in Argos, of the colony of Danaus, likewise
from Egypt, about 1500.&mdash;The colony of Cadmus, from Ph&#339;nicia,
settles in B&#339;otia about 1550.&mdash;The colony of Pelops, from
Mysia, settles in Argos about 1400.

Progress of
civilization
among the
Hellenes.

6. The mythology of the Hellenes proves beyond
a doubt, that they were at first savages, like
the Pelasgi since they had to learn even the use
of fire from Prometheus; yet it is equally clear
that they must, even in the earliest period, particularly
from 1300&mdash;1200, when they had ceased
to migrate, have made the first important steps
towards the attainment of a certain degree of
civilization. About the time of the Trojan war
they appear to have been still barbarians, though
no longer savages.

Was the
Hellenic
civilization
of native or
foreign
growth?

7. The origin and progress of this national organization,
and the influence wrought upon it by
settlers from foreign countries, are difficult subjects
to determine. If we allow that Cecrops was
the first who introduced marriage in Attica, and
that agriculture and the cultivation of the olive
were discovered in that country, it unquestionably
follows, that the Hellenes were indebted to
strangers for the foundation of domestic civilization.
And when we consider that the families
which subsequently held sway were descended
directly from the most powerful of these strangers,
their lasting influence can hardly be a matter of
doubt. It must, however, be observed, that what
the Greeks borrowed from foreigners they previously
stamped with their own peculiar charac[Pg 123]ter,
so that it became, as it were, the original
property of the nation. The question, therefore,
is deprived of much of the importance which it
assumes at the first glance.

Hellenic religion
derived from
foreigners.

8.  The case was the same with regard to all
branches of intellectual civilization, particularly
religion. That many deities and religious
rites were introduced into Greece from Egypt,
Asia, and Thrace, and generally through Crete,
hardly admits of a doubt; but they did not therefore
remain Egyptian, Asiatic, or Thracian; they
became Grecian gods. Hence it appears that the
investigation of those relations can hardly lead to
any important conclusion. It is a fact, however,
of the highest importance, that whatever gods the
No sacerdotal caste in Greece.
Greeks adopted, no separate order of priesthood
was established among them, still less any caste
laying claim to the exclusive possession of knowledge.
Several traces, nevertheless, make it probable,
that many of the most ancient sanctuaries
were settlements of Egyptian, Ph&#339;nician, or
Cretan priests, who imported with them their
own peculiar forms of worship. And notwithstanding
this worship consisted merely of outward
ceremonies, many ideas and institutions
which were attached to it, became, in this manner,
the common property of the nation.

Influence of
the bards:

9.  It was principally, therefore, by religion,
that the rude mind became in some degree polished.
But it was the ancient minstrels,
(&#7936;&#959;&#953;&#948;&#959;&#8054;,)
Orpheus, Linus, etc., who, by disseminating religious
principles, contributed so much towards
abolishing revenge, and with it the perpetual
state of warfare which had hitherto distracted the[Pg 124]
country. These it was who in their mysteries
contrived in some measure to impress the narrow
circle of the initiated with the advantages resulting
from a civilized life.

Sainte-Croix, Recherches sur les Myst&egrave;res du Paganisme,
Paris, 1765. Translated into German, with valuable observations,
by C. G. Lenz; Gotha, 1790.

of the oracles:

10. The influence of religion, through the medium
of oracles, especially those of Dodona and
Delphi, was not less powerful. The two latter,
with that of Olympia, were perhaps, originally
ancient settlements of priests, such as have been
already alluded to. The necessity of consulting
these sanctuaries naturally led men to regard the
oracles as the common property of the nation,
to which every one should have access; it followed
therefore as an inevitable consequence, that
the direction of affairs in which all were engaged,
depended principally on those oracles.

A. Van Dalen, De Oraculis veterum Ethnicorum Dissertationes6. Amstel. 1700. A very valuable work. A comprehensive
dissertation on the subject, however, is still wanting: a portion
of it is treated of in

J. Groddek, De Oraculorum veterum, qu&aelig; in Herodoti libris
continentur, natura, commentatio; Gotting. 1786.

of the religious
festivals:

11. It happened with Greece as with other
countries; the tender plant of civilization grew
up under the shelter of the sanctuary. There the
festivals were celebrated, and there the people
assembled; and there various tribes, who had
hitherto been strangers to one another, met in
peace, and conversed on their common interests.
Hence arose spontaneously the first idea of a law
of nations, and those connections which led to its[Pg 125]
development. Among these connections, that of
the Amphictyons at Delphi was the most important,
and continued the longest: it is probable
that it did not assume its complete form till a
later period; yet it appears in early times to have
adopted the principle, that none of the cities belonging
to the league should be destroyed by the
others.

&#8224; Fr. Wilh. Tittmann, Upon the Amphictyonic League;
1812. A dissertation which gained the prize of the Academy of
Sciences at Berlin.

of navigation:


12. To religion must likewise be added navigation,
and the consequent intercourse which
brought the nation into contact with strangers, and
prepared it to receive civilization. It cannot be
denied that the navigators continued long to be
mere pirates; but as Minos of Crete cleared the
about 1400
sea of freebooters, the want of another state of
things must have been felt long before.

Age of chivalry.

13. In the mean time the chivalrous spirit of
the nation was gradually aroused; and developed
the first bloom of its youthful vigour in the heroic
ages. An affection for extraordinary undertakings
was excited; and conducted the chieftains, not
only individually, but also in confederate bodies,
beyond the limits of their father-land. These undertakings
were not only important in themselves,
but their advantages were increased by their
being preserved in the songs of their bards by
means of a national poesy, such as no other people
possessed, and such as contributed to the further
development of the national genius.

Expedition of the Argonauts to Colchis, somewhere about
B. C. 1250; war of the seven confederate princes against Thebes[Pg 126]
about 1225; the town, however, was not taken until the second
attempt made by the sons of the chiefs (Epigoni) in 1215.

Effects of
the Trojan
war.


14. Thus every thing was now ripe for some
great national undertaking of all the combined
Hellenic nations; and that object was attained in
the war against Troy. The most important result of
that expedition was the kindling of one common
national spirit,&mdash;a spirit which in spite of dissensions
and feuds, was never wholly extinguished,
and which must almost necessarily have arisen
1194&mdash;1184
from an expedition carried on in so distant a
field, which lasted ten years, in which all were
joined, and which was crowned with such signal
success. From the time of the Trojan war downwards
the Hellenes always looked upon themselves
as but one people.

powerful of which were Argos and Mycen&aelig;.&mdash;All those states

to their valour in battle.&mdash;Manner of life among the

SECOND PERIOD.

From the Trojan war to the breaking out of the Persian
war, B. C. 1200&mdash;500.

Sources. On no portion of the Grecian history is our information
so scanty as upon this long period, in which we can be
hardly said to have more than a general knowledge of many of
the most important events. As in the foregoing period, its commencement
is but a traditional and poetical history. It was not
till towards the end of it that the use of writing became common
among the Greeks; add to which the period itself was not rife
in great national undertakings, such as might afford appropriate
materials for the poet or historian. Besides the scattered information
which may be gathered from Herodotus, Plutarch,
Strabo, and above all from the introduction to Thucydides's history,
Pausanias must not be forgotten; who, in his description
of Greece, has preserved an abundance of most valuable documents
relating to the separate histories of the minor states. The
Books of Diodorus belonging to this period are lost.

the Heraclid&aelig;:
about B. C.
1100.

1. The Trojan war was followed by a very
stormy period, in consequence of the many disorders
prevalent in the ruling families, especially
in that of Pelops. But more violent commotions
soon arose, caused by the attempts of
the rude tribes of the north, particularly of the
Dorians combined with the &AElig;tolians, who, under
the guidance of the descendants of Hercules,[Pg 128]
exiled from Argos, strove to obtain possession of
Peloponnesus. Those commotions shook Greece
during a whole century, and as the seats of most
of the Hellenic tribes were then changed, the
consequences were lasting and important.

First unsuccessful attempt under Hyllus, son of Hercules,
about 1180.&mdash;Repeated attempts, until at last the claims of the
Heraclid&aelig; are made good by the grandsons of Hyllus, viz. Telephus
and Cresphontes, together with Eurysthenes and Procles,
sons of their brother Aristodemus, 1100.

revolution.


2. Consequences resulting to the Peloponnesus
from this migration. The territories of Argos,
Sparta, Messene, and Corinth, wrested from the
Ach&aelig;ans who had hitherto inhabited them, become
the property of the Dorians; Elis falls
to the share of the &AElig;tolians, who had accompanied
the former. The Ach&aelig;ans expelled, in their
turn expel the Ionians and settle in the country
since called Achaia; the fugitive Ionians are received
by their ancient kinsmen the Athenians.&mdash;But
among the consequences of this migration of
the Hellenic races must be reckoned likewise the
Colonies sent to Asia.
establishment of Greek colonies in Asia Minor;
an occurrence of the highest importance to the
ulterior development of the nation. This colonization
was commenced by the &AElig;olian Hellenes,
whose example was soon after followed by the
Ionians, and even by the Dorians.

For the history of these colonies, see the following section.

Monarchies
succeeded
by republics.

3. Although the effect of these migrations and
wars, in which the ruder tribes oppressed the
more civilized, must inevitably have been, not
only to interrupt the progress of civilization, but
even almost entirely to annihilate it, yet in this[Pg 129]
universal movement the foundation was laid of
that constitution of things which afterwards existed
in Greece. The tribes which had migrated,
as well as those which had been expelled, remained
at first under the dominion of their hereditary
princes, some for a longer, others for a
shorter time. In the two centuries, however,
immediately subsequent to the migrations, B. C.
1100&mdash;900, republican constitutions took the place
of hereditary clanship in all the Grecian countries,
the distant Epirus excepted. These republics
continued to exist amid the various revolutions
which happened; and the love of political freedom,
deeply impressed on the minds of the people,
constituted from this time the principal feature
in the national character.

Origin of
the small
republics.

4. The sequel proves, that the principal cause
of this change so important for Greece,&mdash;this
change, by which her future internal policy was
for ever determined, originated in the progress
made by the newly come tribes towards civic life,
and consequently at the same time towards national
civilization. In this newly constituted
order of things, each city, with the territory
around it, formed a separate state, and framed
its own constitution; hence there arose as many
free states as cities.

The notion that Greece contained the same number of states
as countries is completely false, although it cannot be denied that
the mode of expression in most writings upon Greek history
seems to authorize the assertion. It is true that some of those
countries, such as Attica, Megaris, Laconia, may be each regarded
as a separate state, because each constituted the territory
of one city. The others, however, such as Arcadia, B&#339;otia, etc.
did not each form one state, but comprised as many separate
states as there were free and independent cities, each of which,[Pg 130]
with its territory, formed one. Still, however, it must be observed,
(a) that the natural ties of kindred subsisted; Arcadians,
B&#339;otians, etc. spoke of one another as countrymen. (b) Voluntary
connections were entered into between different cities,
and sometimes all the cities of a country, as, for instance, in
Achaia, so that the whole formed one confederation; each individual
city nevertheless still preserved its own system of laws
and government. Again, (c) in consequence of a greater share
of power, one city assumed a sort of dominion over the other;
as, for instance, that of Thebes over the B&#339;otian cities. This
dominion, however, was always precarious, and depended upon
the state of affairs. (d) It must likewise be observed, that
the constitution of each separate city underwent many changes,
wrought generally by influential citizens, (tyrants,) who not
only possessed themselves of the supreme power, but also contrived
frequently to make it for some time hereditary in their
families. Every one will easily discern that the above are the
fundamental principles of Greek history, which cannot be too
clearly conceived, or too correctly defined; since it is self-evident
what a wide field was by such a constitution of things
thrown open to practical politics. The more improbable the attainment
of fixed constitutions in the separate cities was, the
more frequent must have been the political attempts; (attempts
facilitated by the narrow extent of the state;) and the more frequently
those attempts failed, the more extensive in this intellectual
people became the mass of political ideas; the results
of which in later times were the legislative codes of Solon and
others.

Unity of the
small Grecian
states.

5. Although Greece was thus parcelled out
into a number of small states, united by no common
political bond, yet there existed a certain
unity of the Hellenic race, a certain national
spirit: this was produced in part by national
festivals and games, occurring at stated periods,
among which those in honour of Jupiter at Olympia
were the chief. The nation at these appeared
in all its splendour; and all Hellenes, but no
others, were allowed to join in them. This union,
too, was promoted by the extension of the Am[Pg 131]phictyonic
council: and the reason why this last
institution was not followed by all the consequences
which might have been expected from
it, may perhaps be found in what naturally takes
place in every great confederation whenever any
of the component states become too powerful.

The Amphictyonic council was certainly not a states-general,
in which all national affairs were discussed. Its immediate office
was to attend to the temples and the oracles of Delphi. But
then it must be observed, 1st, that from this council originated
the Grecian ideas of the law of nations; over the preservation
of which the Amphictyons watched. 2. In consequence of its
political influence on the oracle, this council, in certain cases,
was enabled to take a share in the affairs of different states.
3. The Amphictyons always formed a national institution, since
none but Hellenes were admitted.

not only into the institutions of the Amphictyons, but
also into other matters of Grecian history connected with them.

Sparta and
Athens.

6. Among the different states of Greece, Sparta
and Athens, even at this period, became celebrated,
not only for their greater power, but also
for their superior constitutions and their laws:
and though it may not perhaps be strictly true,
that the history of the rest of Greece is connected
with that of these two cities, yet they certainly
possess the highest claim to our attention.

7. History of Sparta. The Ach&aelig;ans at first were
governed by princes of the house of Perseus, but
after Menelaus's accession to the throne in virtue
of his wife, by princes of the house of Pelops.
When the latter had been expelled by the Dorians,
Laconia fell by lot to the sons of Aristodemus,
Procles and Eurysthenes, between whose
families the royal power was divided, so that two[Pg 132]
kings constantly reigned in common, one from
each family.

8. The Dorians now gradually conquered, and
established themselves in many cities of the peninsula;
forming, if not the whole population, at
least the only part of it that enjoyed any power,
as the Ach&aelig;ans that remained were reduced to
slavery. No long time, however, elapsed ere the
city of Sparta usurped an authority over the
whole country, which it ever afterwards preserved;
the other towns, formerly considerable,
becoming unfortified, defenceless, and insignificant.

the country, as subjects who paid tribute and military service.
Even in the time of Agis, the successor of Eurysthenes, this
subjection was effected by force; the inhabitants of Helos were
made slaves, as a punishment for their opposition; while the
others, by the sacrifice of their political freedom, preserved their
personal liberty, however confined it might be.

Repeated
wars of the
Spartans.

9. The history of the two following centuries,
to the time of Lycurgus, exhibits nothing but the
repeated wars of the Spartans with their neighbours
the Argives; their domestic broils, occasioned
by the too unequal division of property,
by the feuds, and the diminished power of the
[Pg 133]kings, and which lasted until Lycurgus, the uncle
and guardian of the minor king, Charilaus, about
the year 880, gave to Sparta that constitution to
which she was principally indebted for her subsequent
splendour.

Illustration of the principal features in the Spartan constitution.
Some preliminary observations are necessary. (a) As the
legislation of Lycurgus occurred at so early a period, and as his
laws were not written, but conveyed in apophthegms,
(&#8165;&#942;&#964;&#961;&#945;&#953;,)
which were confirmed by the oracle of Delphi, many things of
later origin have been attributed to Lycurgus. (b) Much that is
rightly attributed to him was not original, but deduced from ancient
Dorian institutions, which being now upon the decline,
were reestablished by force of law. Hence it follows, that the
legislation of Lycurgus must naturally have had many points
of resemblance with that of the Cretans, likewise of Dorian
origin, although much, as we are told, was directly borrowed from
them. (c) The principal object of the laws of Lycurgus was to
ensure the existence of Sparta by creating and supporting a
vigorous and uncorrupted race of men. Hence those laws had a
more peculiar reference to private life and physical education,
than to the constitution of the state, in which the legislator appears
to have introduced but few alterations.

In reference to the constitution: 1. The relation which had
hitherto existed between the Spartans as a dominant people, and
the Laced&aelig;monians as subjects, was preserved. 2. The two
kings, from the two ruling families, were likewise continued, as
leaders in war and first magistrates in peace. On the other hand,
3. to Lycurgus is attributed the institution of a senate,
(&#947;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#973;&#963;&#953;&#945;,)
consisting of twenty-eight members, none of whom could be less
than sixty years old, who were to be chosen by the people for
life, and were to constitute the king's council in public affairs.
4. Whether the college of the five Ephori annually chosen, was
originally instituted by Lycurgus, or at some later period, is a
question impossible to decide, but of little importance, since the
great power of this college, to which every thing was finally referred
as the highest tribunal of the state, was certainly assumed
after the time of Lycurgus. 5. Besides the above, there were
likewise the popular assemblies, convened according to the division
into &#966;&#973;&#955;&#945;&#962; and
&#8036;&#946;&#945;&#962;, at which none but Spartans could assist:[Pg 134]
their privileges extended no further than to approve or reject the
measures proposed to them by the kings and the senate.

In the laws relating to private life, Lycurgus aimed at making
the Spartans a society of citizens, equal as far as possible with
respect to their property and mode of life, and each deeply impressed
with the conviction that he was the property of his
country, to which he was bound to yield an unconditional obedience.
Hence, 1. The new division of land, 9000 portions to
the Spartans, and 30,000 to the Laced&aelig;monians; permission
being given to dispose of those portions by entail or gift, but
not by sale. 2. The removal as far as possible of every species
of luxury, particularly by means of the daily public tables
(&#963;&#965;&#963;&#963;&#943;&#964;&#953;&#945;)
of all the citizens, according to their divisions, in which
the commons were settled by law. 3. The complete organization
of domestic society in relation both to husband and wife, parents
and children, which was so framed as to further, even at the cost
of morality, the grand political object, the production of vigorous
and healthy citizens. 4. Hence, finally, the condition of the
slaves, comprehended under the general name of helots, who,
although they may be regarded nearly as serfs, were likewise the
property of the state, which had the right of claiming their services
in war.&mdash;Easy, however, as it is to enumerate thus generally
the principal heads of the Spartan constitution, the want of
sufficient documents renders it difficult and oftentimes impossible
to answer a crowd of questions, which present themselves on our
penetrating more deeply into the subject. Still, however, its
long duration, (nearly four hundred years,) without any observable
change, is more remarkable even than the constitution itself.
More remarkable, inasmuch as the Spartans soon after this time
appear as conquerors. Indeed, it could no longer be expected
that any durable peace should exist in Greece, while the centre
of the country was occupied by a military commonwealth, whose
citizens must have been, by the restlessness common to man, impelled
to war, since all the occupations of household life and of
agriculture were left to the care of slaves.

Wars of the
Spartans in
Peloponnesus.

10. Soon after the time of Lycurgus com[Pg 135]menced
the war of the Spartans with their neighbours,
the Argives, the Arcadians, but more particularly
the Messenians. The wars with these
last appear to have originated in an old grudge
on the part of the Dorian tribe, proceeding from
the unequal division of lands at the occupation of
Peloponnesus: it is nevertheless evident, that
the quarrel between the two nations was mainly
fostered by the ambition of the Spartan kings,
who wrought upon a superstitious multitude by
oracular responses and interpretations.

Unimportant wars with Tegea and Argos; and disputes with
Messene, 783&mdash;745.

First Messenian war, 742&mdash;722, terminated by the capture of
the frontier fortress Ithome, after the voluntary death of the
Messenian king, Aristodemus.&mdash;The Messenians become tributary
to the Spartans, and are obliged to give up one half of the
revenues of their lands.&mdash;Occurrences during this war: 1. Institution,
according to some authorities, of the college of Ephori as
vicegerents of the kings in their absence, and arbitrators in the
quarrels which might arise between the kings and the senate.
2. The power of the people so far limited as to restrain the
popular assemblies from making alterations in the resolutions
proposed to them by the senate or the kings, and confining them
merely to a vote of approval or rejection. 3. Insurrection of the
Parthenii and Helots becomes the motive for sending out colonies;
a measure to which Sparta had more than once resorted
for the purpose of maintaining domestic tranquillity.

Second Messenian war, 682&mdash;668, waged by the Messenians
under the command of their hero Aristomenes, by the Spartans
under that of Tyrt&aelig;us, who fanned the flame of war until the
contest was terminated by the capture of the strong town Ira.
The Messenian territory is divided among the conquerors, and
the conquered inhabitants become, like the helots, agricultural
slaves.

Sparta takes
the lead
among the
Dorian
states

11. Although the territory of the Spartans was
greatly increased by these Messenian wars, the
nation seems to have been a long time before it[Pg 136]
recovered from the struggle, and to have raised
itself by slow steps to the first rank among the
Dorian states, extending its boundaries at the
expense of the Argives and Arcadians.

Wars with Tegea for the most part unsuccessful; and with
Argos, for the possession of Thyrea and the island of Cythera;
by the accession of which the Spartan territory received an important
augmentation, about 550.

First interference
of Sparta in
affairs without
the
peninsula.

12. These wars within Peloponnesus were not
of such a nature as to give rise to any remarkable
changes in the Spartan constitution, and for a
long time the nation refused to take any share in
foreign affairs. But no sooner did king Cleomenes,
who in the end procured the deposition of
his colleague, Demaratus, interfere in the affairs
of the Athenians, than the seeds of strife were
sown between these two republics. The Persian
war next ensued, in which Sparta was obliged
to bear a part, although Cleomenes had refused
to participate in the insurrection of Aristagoras:
that struggle, together with the idea of supremacy
in Greece which now took its rise, introduced
a series of political relations before
unknown.

History of
Athens.

13. The history of Athens during this period is
rendered important rather by domestic revolutions,
which gradually tended to convert the
state into a republic, than by external aggrandizement.
The situation and peculiarities of Attica,
which rendered it less exposed than other parts
of Greece to the attacks and forays of wandering
hordes, favoured the gradual and tranquil growth
of national prosperity; the traces of which are
incontestable, though it would be difficult for the[Pg 137]
most profound research to point out the whole
course of its progress so perspicuously as the historian
might wish.

The history of Athens, of course, constitutes a main part of the
works mentioned above, p. 119. Besides which:

W. Young, The history of Athens politically and philosophically
considered. London, 1796. 4to. Argumentation rather
than history.

Corsini, Fasti Attici. Florent. 1747. 4 vols. 4to. A most
careful chronological essay.

1. Period of kingly government down to 1068. The history
of Athens as a state begins properly with Theseus, who succeeded
his father &AElig;geus, about B. C. 1300. Although certain
institutions, such as that of the areopagus, the division of the
people into nobles, (&#949;&#8016;&#960;&#945;&#964;&#961;&#943;&#948;&#945;&#953;,)
husbandmen, (&#947;&#949;&#974;&#961;&#947;&#959;&#953;,)
and mechanics: (&#948;&#951;&#956;&#953;&#959;&#973;&#961;&#947;&#959;&#953;&#903;)
a division which recals to our memory the
Egyptian institution of castes, are perhaps of an earlier date, and
may be ascribed to the colony of Cecrops. Theseus was, however,
in some measure the founder of the state, since, instead of
the four districts, (&#948;&#942;&#956;&#959;&#953;,)
hitherto independent of one another, he
constituted the city of Athens as the only seat of government.
Among his successors the attention of the student is directed to
Mnestheus, who fell before Troy; and the last king, Codrus,
who by a voluntary sacrifice of his life rescued Attica from the
inroads of the Dorians, 1068.

2. Period of archons for life, taken from the family of Codrus,
thirteen of whom ruled; 1068&mdash;752. The first was Medon, the
last, Alcm&aelig;on. These archons succeeded, like the kings, by inheritance,
but were accountable for their administration,
(&#8017;&#960;&#949;&#973;&#952;&#965;&#957;&#959;&#953;.)&mdash;At
the commencement of this period occur the migrations
of the Ionians from Attica to Asia Minor, 1044. See
below.

3. Period of the decennial archons, seven of whom succeeded
between 752&mdash;682. These likewise were taken from the family
of Codrus. This period is devoid of any remarkable occurrences.

4. Period extending to Solon, 682&mdash;594. that of nine archons
yearly chosen, but so arranged that the prerogatives of the former
kings, and the preceding archons, were divided among the three
first of the nine. With respect to this, as well as to the other
changes above mentioned, we know little of the causes which
produced them, or of the manner in which they were brought
[Pg 138]about. Rise of an oppressive aristocracy, (like that of the patricians
at Rome, immediately after the expulsion of the kings,)
both the archons and the members of the areopagus being elected
only from noble families. First attempt at legislation by Draco,
622, which appears only to have consisted in a criminal code,
rendered unavailing by its severity.&mdash;The insurrection of Cylon,
598, in consequence of the manner in which it was quelled,
turned out most injurious to the aristocratical party, inasmuch as
the nobles drew upon themselves the pollution of blood, which,
even after the purification of Epimenides, 593, was long used as
a pretext for commotion. The political factions of the Pedi&aelig;i,
of the Diacrii, and of the Parhali, produced an anarchy at Athens,
during which the neighbouring Megarians took possession of the
island of Salamis; a conquest which, however, was subsequently
wrested from them by Solon.

Solon's
legislation,
594.

14. From this state of anarchy Athens was
rescued by Solon; a man to whom not only
Athens, but the whole human race, are deeply
indebted. He was chosen archon, and at the
same time commissioned to remodel the constitution
of Athens: and the successful manner in
which he executed this task, laid the foundation
of the happiness of his native country.

Review of the prominent features in Solon's legislation. Its
main object was to abolish the oppressive aristocracy, without
however introducing a pure democracy. 1. Provisional laws:
abolition of the statutes of Draco, those against murder excepted:
law enacted for the relief of debtors,
(&#963;&#949;&#953;&#963;&#945;&#967;&#952;&#949;&#943;&#945;, nov&aelig; tabul&aelig;,)
not so much by cancelling the debts as by diminishing their
amount by a rise in the value of money; and likewise by ensuring
the personal liberty of the debtor. 2. Fundamental laws,
both in reference to the constitution and in reference to private
life and private rights.&mdash;Constitution of the state. (a) Organization
of the people by means of divisions: according to property
into four classes; the Pentacosimedimni, or those who had
a yearly income of 500 medimni; the Equites, (&#7985;&#960;&#960;&#949;&#8150;&#962;,) who had
400; the Zeugit&aelig;, who had 300; and the Thetes, (capite censi,)
whose yearly revenue did not amount to so much.&mdash;The ancient
divisions according to heads, into wards, (&#966;&#973;&#955;&#945;&#953;,) of which there
[Pg 139]were four, and according to residence into demi, (hundreds,) of
which a hundred and seventy are enumerated, were preserved.
(b) None but citizens of the three first classes could fill all the
offices of state; but all were admitted to the popular assemblies,
and had a right of voting in the courts of judicature. (c) The
nine archons annually chosen, who acted as supreme magistrates,
although not permitted to assume military office at the same
time, remained at the head of the state; the first bearing the
name of &#7952;&#960;&#974;&#957;&#965;&#956;&#959;&#962;, the second of
&#946;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#955;&#949;&#8058;&#962;, the third of
&#960;&#959;&#955;&#941;&#956;&#945;&#961;&#967;&#959;&#962;,
the remaining six that of &#952;&#949;&#963;&#956;&#959;&#952;&#8050;&#964;&#945;&#953;.
Combined with the archons was (d) The council,
(&#946;&#959;&#965;&#955;&#8052;,) which consisted of a body of four
hundred persons annually taken from the three first classes of
citizens; (a hundred from each ward;) these were chosen by
lot, but were obliged to submit to a rigid examination (&#948;&#959;&#954;&#953;&#956;&#945;&#963;&#943;&#945;)
before they entered upon office. The archons were obliged to
consult the four hundred on every occurrence; and nothing
could be carried down to the commons until it had been previously
debated in this council. (e) To the people, consisting of
the whole four classes, was reserved the right in its assemblies
(&#7952;&#954;&#954;&#955;&#951;&#963;&#943;&#945;&#953;)
of confirming the laws, of electing the magistrates, of
debating all public affairs referred to them by the council, and
likewise the public distribution of justice. (f) The areopagus
was, according to Solon's plan, to be the main buttress of the
constitution; that tribunal had hitherto been a mere tool in the
hands of the aristocracy. It was composed of retired archons,
and remained not only the supreme tribunal in capital cases, but
likewise was charged with the superintendence of morals, with
the censorship upon the conduct of the archons who went out of
office, and had the prerogative of amending or rescinding the
measures that had been approved of by the commons. The
power of this court, which might easily have become equal to the
college of Ephori at Sparta, might at first have been supposed
too extensive, had not experience shown the fatal consequences
of the reduction of that power by Pericles. This alloy of aristocracy
and democracy certainly gives proof of a deep insight into
the nature of republican constitutions; but Solon is not less entitled
to praise for his endeavours to place the helm of government
in the hands only of the most enlightened and prudent
citizens. It must likewise be observed, that the code for private
life given by Solon exhibits the genius of a man who regarded
polity as subordinate to morals, and not, like Lycurgus, morals as
subordinate to polity.

so far as it was connected with government by clans

An explanation of the Athenian constitution will be likewise

Wachsmuth.

Tyranny established in Athens by Pisistratus.

15. The legislation of Solon, like all other state
reforms, was not followed by the total extinction
of party spirit. It was natural that the commons,
now free, should wish to try their strength with
the aristocratical party, and that, after the defeat
of the latter, Pisistratus, who headed the commons,
should grasp the rudder of the state without,
therefore, necessarily abrogating the constitution
of Solon. Modern history has proved
with sufficient evidence, that the frame-work of a
republic may easily subsist under the rule of an
usurper. And would that no republics might
fall into the hands of a worse tyrant than Pisistratus!

First exaltation of Pisistratus, 561, procured by his obtaining
a body guard; flight of the Alcm&aelig;onid&aelig; under Megacles. Pisistratus
expelled, 560. Second exaltation of Pisistratus procured
by his matrimonial connection with the family of Megacles,
556&mdash;552.&mdash;His second expulsion by Megacles, 552&mdash;538.&mdash;His
third exaltation; obtains the power by force of arms, and preserves
it to the day of his death, 538&mdash;528. Flight of the Alcm&aelig;onid&aelig;
into Macedonia, where they attach the malcontents to
their party. Pisistratus is succeeded by his sons Hipparchus
and Hippias, who rule conjointly until 514, when the elder is
murdered by Harmodius and Aristogiton. The exiled Alcm&aelig;onid&aelig;,
having bribed the Delphian oracle, gain over the Spartans[Pg 141]
to their interest: backed by a Spartan army, they take possession
of Athens in 510; Hippias is deposed, and flies over to the Persians.

Changes in Solon's constitution.

16. This return of the Alcm&aelig;onid&aelig; was followed
by a change in the constitution of Solon.
Clisthenes, the son of Megacles, with a view of
quenching party spirit by a new combination of
the citizens, increased the number of wards to
ten, and that of the members of the council to
five hundred.&mdash;But the Athenians had to purchase
the continuance of their freedom by a struggle
with Sparta, who, united with the B&#339;otians
and Chalcidians, and aided by &AElig;gina, sought to
527&mdash;504.
reestablish monarchy in Attica; first in the person
of Isagoras, the rival of Clisthenes, and afterwards
in that of the exiled Hippias. But the
glorious success of the republic in this first struggle
in the cause of liberty, gave an additional
impulse to the national spirit. Impelled by that
spirit, Athens suffered herself to be induced to
share in the war of freedom carried on by the
Asiatic Greeks under Aristagoras; and the audacity
500.
which led to the firing of Sardis, drew upon
Attica the vengeance of the Persians, without
which, doubtless, neither Athens or Greece would
ever have risen to that degree of eminence which
they ultimately attained.

History of
the other
Grecian
states.

17. Of the history of the other states of Greece
we have at best but few data, and even these in
most instances are very scanty. Towards the
end of this period Sparta and Athens had, undoubtedly,
exalted themselves above the rest, and
were recognized, one as the first among the Dorian,
the latter as the first among the Ionian[Pg 142]
states; yet did Sparta more than once meet
with rivals in Messene, Argos, and Tegea: while
Athens had to contend with Megara and &AElig;gina.
Sparta and Athens had, nevertheless, not only
the best constitutions, but possessed also a more
extended territory than any other of the great
cities.


Principal data for the history of the smaller states.

I. Within the Peloponnesus.

a. Arcadia. The Arcadian traditions enumerate a line of
kings or hereditary princes, said to have ruled over the whole of
Arcadia; the line commences with Arcas and his son Lycaon,
whose successors kept possession of the supreme power, and
shared more or less in the ancient feuds of the Hellenic princes.
Upon the conquest of Peloponnesus by the Dorians, Arcadia was
the only land that did not suffer by the irruption: an advantage
for which it was probably indebted more to its mountains, than
to the skill of Cypselus its king. The successors of that prince
took a part in the wars between the Messenians and Spartans,
siding with the former: but in the second Messenian war, the
last Arcadian king, Aristocrates II. having betrayed his allies,
was in consequence stoned to death by his subjects, and the regal
dignity was abolished in 668. Arcadia now became divided into
as many small states as it contained cities with their respective
districts; among these Tegea and Mantinea were the chief, and
probably held the others in a certain state of control, without,
however, depriving them wholly of their independence. As
might have been expected in a pastoral nation, the constitution
was democratical. In Mantinea there were wardens of the people,
(&#948;&#951;&#956;&#953;&#959;&#973;&#961;&#947;&#959;&#953;,)
and a senate, (&#946;&#959;&#965;&#955;&#942;.) The wars of separate cities
are frequently mentioned, but no general confederation united
them.

&#8224; See A. von Breitenbauch, History of Arcadia, 1791.

b. Argos. Even previously to the Dorian migration, the
country of Argolis was parcelled out into several small kingdoms,
such as those of Argos, Mycen&aelig;, and Tiryns. In Argos, the[Pg 143]
oldest Grecian state next to Sicyon, ruled the forefathers of Perseus,
who exchanged the kingdom of his ancestors for Tiryns:
here his successors continued to reign till the time of Hercules,
whose sons, expelled by Eurystheus, sought an asylum among
the Dorians.&mdash;In Mycen&aelig;, said to have been built by Perseus,
the throne was occupied by the family of Pelops: and at the
period of the Trojan war, this little state, to which Corinth and
Sicyon then belonged, was the most powerful in Greece, and governed
by Agamemnon. The migration into this country by
Pelops from Asia Minor, must have been attended with important
consequences, since it has given a name to the whole peninsula:
the object of Pelops, as we may infer from the riches he brought
with him, was probably to establish a trading settlement.&mdash;At
the Dorian conquest Argos fell to the share of Temenus, the
Ach&aelig;ans were expelled, and the country was peopled by Dorians.
As early as the reign of Cisus, son of Temenus, the royal power
was so limited, that the successors of that prince hardly preserved
any thing but the mere name: about 984 the regal dignity
was wholly abrogated, and its place supplied by a republican
constitution, concerning the domestic organization of which we
know nothing more than that at Argos the government was in
the hands of a senate, (&#946;&#959;&#965;&#955;&#8052;,) of a college of eighty citizens,
(&#959;&#7985; &#8000;&#947;&#948;&#959;&#942;&#954;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#945;,)
and of magistrates, who bore the name of
&#7936;&#961;&#964;&#973;&#957;&#959;&#953;: in Epidaurus, however, there was a body of one hundred and eighty
citizens who chose from among themselves the senate, the members
of which were called &#7936;&#961;&#964;&#973;&#957;&#959;&#953;. As in the other states of
Greece so in Argolis, there were as many independent states as
there were cities; in the north Argos, Mycen&aelig;, and Tiryns; in
the south Epidaurus and Tr&#339;zen. The two last preserved their
independence; but Mycen&aelig; was destroyed by the Argives in 425,
and the inhabitants of Tiryns were forcibly transplanted to Argos.
The district of Argos, therefore, comprised the northern portion
of the country called Argolis; but not the southern portion, which
belonged to the towns situated therein.

c. Corinth. In this place, previous to the time of the Dorian
migration, the house of Sisyphus held the royal power; and
even at that early period Corinth is extolled by Homer for its
wealth. The Dorians drove out the original inhabitants; and
Aletes, belonging to the race of Hercules, became king about
1089; the posterity of that prince held the sceptre down to the
fifth generation. After the death of the last king, Telessus, 777,[Pg 144]
the family of the Bacchiad&aelig;, likewise a branch of the family of
Hercules, took possession of the government and introduced an
oligarchy, electing annually from among themselves a Prytane.
At last, in 657, Cypselus got the upper hand; he was succeeded,
627, by his son Periander; both father and son were equally
conspicuous for their avarice and cruelty. Periander (d. 587)
was succeeded by his nephew Psammetichus, who reigned till
584, when the Corinthians asserted their freedom. With regard
to the internal organization of the republic, little more is known
than that there were at Corinth assemblies of the commons and a
senate, (&#947;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#943;&#945;): the government appears to have been the
aristocracy of a trading state; for even the Bacchiad&aelig;, at least
some of them, were merchants.&mdash;The Corinthian commerce consisted
chiefly in the exchange of Asiatic and Italian goods, and
therefore was mostly carried on by sea: for such a trade the city
of Corinth offered many advantages, particularly if we consider
the state of navigation in those times; but the sea trade of
Corinth, however profitable to the citizens, and even to the
state, in consequence of the customs, cannot be considered as
very extensive.&mdash;The colonies of Corinth in the west were principally
Corcyra, Epidamnus, Leucas, Syracuse; in the east Potid&aelig;a:
these colonies would fain have asserted a sort of independence,
but never succeeded for any length of time in so doing.

From the possession of these colonies, and from the necessity
of protecting the trader from pirates, Corinth grew to be a naval
power; she invented triremes, and at the early date of 664 gave
battle to the Corcyr&aelig;ans at sea. On the other hand, her wars by
land were generally waged with the assistance of foreign subsidiaries;
and from the facility with which she was enabled to pay
her mercenary troops, she was the more ready to interfere in the
domestic wars of Greece.

d. Sicyon. Tradition represents this state, together with Argos,
as the most ancient in Greece; the catalogues of early kings
and princes, who are said to have reigned at this place, make it
probable that in early antiquity some settlements of priests were
made in this quarter. In the times previous to the migration of
the Dorians, Sicyon was first inhabited by the Ionians; at the
Trojan war, however, it made part of Agamemnon's kingdom.
At the Dorian irruption, Phalces, son of Temenus, took possession
of Sicyon, which then became a Dorian city. After the
abrogation of the kingship, the date of which is not precisely[Pg 145]
known, the constitution assumed the form of an uncurbed democracy,
which, as usual, paved the way for the usurpation of one
individual. Orthagoras and his posterity, the last and most celebrated
of whom was Clisthenes, ruled over Sicyon during a whole
century; 700&mdash;600. After the restoration of her freedom, Sicyon
frequently suffered from revolutions; and the period of her
highest splendour was during the latter days of Greece, when she
became a member of the Ach&aelig;an league.

e. Achaia. During the spread of the Hellenes, this country,
which till then had borne the name of &AElig;gialus, was taken possession
of by Ion, who had been expelled from Athens, and his
tribe, who from their leader took the name of Ionians: the country
remained in the hands of the Ionians until the Dorian migration,
when the Ach&aelig;ans, driven out of Argos and Laconia, pressed
into the northern parts of Peloponnesus under Tisamenus, son
of Orestes: they settled in the land of the Ionians, and the power
of the chieftain descended to his posterity, until the tyranny of
the last sovereign of that race, Gyges, (of date undetermined,)
produced the abolition of monarchy. Achaia thereupon was parcelled
into twelve small republics, or so many cities with their
respective districts, each of which comprised seven or eight cantons.
All these republics had democratic constitutions, and were
mutually united by a league, founded on the most perfect equality,
and which nothing but the policy of the Macedonian kings
could dissolve; and even this dissolution gave rise to the Ach&aelig;an
league, of such high importance in subsequent times. The
Ach&aelig;ans lived in peace and happiness, inasmuch as they had not
the vanity, before the Peloponnesian war, to interfere in the
affairs of foreign states: their constitutions were so renowned,
that they were adopted by several other Grecian cities.

f. Elis. The inhabitants in earlier times bore the name of
Epeans, which, like that of Eleans, was traced to one of their
ancient kings. The names of their most ancient hereditary
princes, Endymion, Epeus, Eleus, Augias, are celebrated by the
poets. It appears that this country was divided into several
small kingdoms, since, at the period of the Trojan war it contained
four, to which however must be added Pylus in Triphylia, a
territory usually reckoned as belonging to Elis. At the epoch
of the Dorian migration the &AElig;tolians, who had accompanied the
Dorians, headed by their chieftain Oxylus, settled in Elis; but
permitted the ancient inhabitants to remain in the country.[Pg 146]
Among the successors of Oxylus was Iphitus the contemporary of
Lycurgus, and celebrated as the restorer of the Olympian games,
to the celebration of which Elis was indebted for the tranquil
splendour that distinguished her from this time: her territory
being regarded as sacred, although she had occasional disputes
with her neighbours, the Arcadians, for precedence at the games.
After the abolition of the royal power supreme magistrates were
chosen, to whose office was added the charge of superintending
the games: (Hellanodic&aelig;). These magistrates were at first two;
they were afterwards increased to ten, one from each tribe,
although their number frequently changed with that of the tribes
themselves. There must likewise have been a senate, consisting
of ninety persons, who held their places for life, since Aristotle
makes mention of that branch of the Elean constitution. The
city of Elis was first built in 477, before which time the Eleans
resided in several small hamlets.


II. Central Greece, or Hellas.

a. Megaris. Until the epoch of the Dorian migration, this
state generally formed part of the domain of the Attic kings; or
at least was governed by princes of that house. Immediately
previous to that event, the Megarians, after the assassination of
their last sovereign, Hyperion, placed the government in the
hands of magistrates elected for stated periods. At the time of
the Dorian irruption, under the reign of Codrus, Megara was occupied
by Dorians, more especially those of Corinth, who consequently
reckoned the city among their colonies, and during the
sway of the Bacchiad&aelig; endeavoured to keep it in a state of
dependency; a circumstance which gave rise to several wars.
Nevertheless Megara supported her rank as a separate state, both
in those and many subsequent wars among the Greeks, in which
she took a share both by sea and land. About the year 600,
Theagenes, step-father of the Athenian Cylon, had possessed
himself of the supreme power: after the expulsion of that tyrant,
the republican constitution was once more restored, but soon
after merged into the lowest species of democracy. Megara,
however, even at the period of the Persian war, in which it took
a glorious share, appears to have recovered the character of a
well-ordered state, although we have no information respecting
its internal organization.
[Pg 147]
b. B&#339;otia. History mentions several very early races in B&#339;otia,
such as the Aones, Hyantes, etc.; with these were mingled
Ph&#339;nician emigrants, who had come into the country under the
guidance of Cadmus. The stock of Cadmus became the ruling
family, and remained so for a long time: the history of his descendants,
who were kings of Thebes, and comprised under their
dominion the greatest part of B&#339;otia, constitutes a main branch
of Grecian mythology: among them were &#338;dipus, La&iuml;us, Eteocles,
and Polynices. After the capture of Thebes by the Epigoni,
1215, the B&#339;otians were expelled by Thracian hordes, and
settled at Arne in Thessaly; at the time of the Dorian migration
they returned to the land of their forefathers, and mingled with
the &AElig;olians of those quarters. Not long after, upon the death
of Xuthus, royalty was abolished, 1126. B&#339;otia was now divided
into as many small states as it contained cities; of these,
next to Thebes, the most eminent were the towns of Plat&aelig;&aelig;,
Thespi&aelig;, Tanagra, and Ch&aelig;ronea, each of which had its own
separate district and peculiar form of government; but all those
constitutions appear to have been commuted into oligarchies
about the time of the Persian war. Such had been the case even
with Thebes, although she had received as a legislator, Philolaus
from Corinth; but the code given by this individual cannot have
been attended with the desired effect, as the government was
continually fluctuating between a licentious democracy and an
overbearing oligarchy. The B&#339;otian cities were, however, mutually
united by a league, at the head of which stood Thebes,
who gradually converted her right of precedence into a right of
power, although her ambitious attempts were resisted to the last
extremity by the separate cities, and by Plat&aelig;&aelig; in particular:
hence sprung many wars. The general affairs were decided upon
in four assemblies, (&#946;&#959;&#965;&#955;&#945;&#8054;,) held in the four districts into which
B&#339;otia was divided; these assemblies in conjunction elected
eleven B&#339;otarchs, who stood at the head of the federation as supreme
magistrates and field marshals. The great extent and
population of their territory might have enabled the B&#339;otians to
act the first part on the theatre of Greece, had they not been impeded
by their pernicious form of government, by the envy felt
against Thebes, and by the want of union which naturally ensued.
Yet in subsequent times the example of Epaminondas and Pelopidas
gave proof that the genius of two men was sufficient to surmount
all these obstacles.
[Pg 148]
c. Phocis was originally ruled by kings descended, it is said,
from Phocus, the leader of a colony from Corinth. The sovereign
power was abolished about the time of the Dorian migration;
but the form of the republican constitution which succeeded
remains undetermined; and of the undertakings of the
Phocians previous to the Persian invasion, we know nothing more
than that they waged war with the Thessalians, and were successful.
As history never mentions the Phocians but in the
aggregate, the whole territory must have formed but one independent
state. To that state, however, the city of Delphi, which
had its own constitution, did not belong: the city of Crissa
with its fertile district, and the harbour of Cirrha, constituted a
separate state, which became opulent by practising extortions
upon the pilgrims to Delphi: this state lasted till 600, when, in
consequence of the insults of the Criss&aelig;ans to the Delphian oracle,
a war was proclaimed against them by the Amphictyons,
which ended in 590 with the rasing of Crissa; the land of which
was thenceforward added to the sacred glebe of Delphi.

d. Locris. Although we learn from early history that the
Locrians also had their kings,&mdash;among whom Ajax, the son of
Oileus, is renowned in the Trojan war,&mdash;and that they likewise
in subsequent times adopted a republican form of government;
yet the date of that revolution, and the manner in which it was
brought about, are not known. The three tribes of Locrians remained
politically distinct. The Locri Ozol&aelig;, west of Phocis,
possessed the most extensive territory; each city of which stood
independent, though Amphissa is mentioned as the capital. The
country of the Locri Opuntii, eastward, consisted of the district
appertaining to the city of Opus; of their domestic organization,
as well as that of their neighbours, the Locri Epicnemidii, we
know nothing.

e. &AElig;tolia. The &AElig;tolians remained the most rude and uncivilized
of all the Hellenic races; they were little more than a
band of freebooters, and carried on their predatory excursions
both by sea and land. Renowned as are the names of their earliest
heroes, &AElig;tolus, Peneus, Meleager, Diomede, the nation
has no place in the history of the flourishing times of Greece.
Nor did they acquire any celebrity until the Macedo-Roman
period, when the various insignificant tribes of which they were
composed gathered themselves together and chose one common
leader, for the purpose of carrying on a war with the[Pg 149]
Ach&aelig;ans. The earlier period of their history seems, however,
to afford no previous example of such an union; their political
constitution in those times is wholly unknown.

f. Acarnania. This country derived its name from Acarnan,
son of Alcm&aelig;on, both of whom are adduced as its earliest kings.
In the Trojan age it appears beyond a doubt, that some part at
least of this country was subject to the governors of the island of
Ithaca. When and how a republican government was introduced
among the Acarnanians, and what were the peculiarities of that
government we know not. All that can be distinguished through
the veil of time is, that here likewise the different cities, the
most important of which was Stratus, had each its own form of
government. Those cities upon particular emergencies were wont
to combine; and out of that practice in later times, during the
Macedonian period, grew up a permanent confederation. The
city and district of Argos Amphilochicum constituted a separate
state, which endured a long time, and flourished greatly; it derived
its name from Amphilochus, the founder. The inhabitants,
however, being driven out by the Ambracians, whom they had
themselves called in, sought assistance at the hands of the Acarnanians,
who with the help of Athens, replaced the exiles in possession
of their city, which thenceforward was inhabited in common
by Amphilochians and Acarnanians, and was almost constantly
engaged in war with Ambracia.


III. Northern Greece.

a. The importance of Thessaly in the earliest history of Greece,
may be gathered from the principal data enumerated above for
the history of the Pelasgi and the Hellenes. From this country
it was that the Hellenes proceeded and spread over Greece; and
here likewise they maintained their original seat. In the Trojan
age Thessaly contained ten small kingdoms, governed by hereditary
princes, several of whom, such as Achilles and Philoctetes,
were among the most renowned heroes of the time. In the period
subsequent to the Trojan war and the Dorian migration,
Thessaly must have experienced political revolutions similar to
those of the other Grecian countries; but neither the time nor
the manner in which those revolutions occurred can be ascertained.
All that can be deduced from the subsequent history is,[Pg 150]
that if the Thessalian cities ever did recover their political freedom,
they were unable to maintain it; for in the two most eminent
cities, Pher&aelig; and Larissa, with whose history that of the
whole country is closely connected, the supreme power had fallen
into the hands of arbitrary individuals, who appear to have kept
possession of it almost without interruption. Even before the
breaking out of the Persian war, Larissa was under the rule of
the Aleuad&aelig;; a family who claimed descent from Hercules, and
are specially denominated by Herodotus kings of the Thessalians.
They preserved their power until the Macedonian period.&mdash;In
Pher&aelig; there arose about the year 380, a tyrant, by the name of
Jason, who extended his dominion not only over Thessaly, but
likewise over several of the neighbouring barbarous tribes. The
sceptre of Jason passed rapidly and successively into the hands
of his three brothers, Polydorus, Polyphron, and Alexander. The
last was first driven out of Larissa by the Aleuad&aelig;, assisted by
the Macedonians; was afterwards worsted in war by Pelopidas;
and finally, at the instigation of his wife Thebe, was murdered,
356, by her brothers, Lycophron and Tisiphonus. The two murderers
then assumed the supreme power, but were, in compliance
with the request of the Aleuad&aelig;, deposed by Philip of Macedon.&mdash;Some
other such tyrants are met with at intervals in the rest
of the Thessalian cities, such as Pharsalus, etc.

b. Epirus. This country was occupied by several tribes, partly
Greek and partly barbarian. The most powerful of these was
that of the Molossi, who were governed by kings of the house of
the &AElig;acid&aelig;, descendants of Pyrrhus, the son of Achilles. This
Greek family was the only one that held the kingly power for a
permanency; it must be observed, however, that previous to the
Macedonian period, those sovereigns were by no means lords of
the whole of Epirus; for the other non-Hellenic races, such as the
Thesprotii, Orestii, etc. had their own separate kings. Moreover
the Corinthian colony of Ambracia constituted a distinct state,
generally governed as a republic, although sometimes subject to
the rule of tyrants. But, in consequence of an alliance framed
with the Macedonian kings, the whole of Epirus, and even Ambracia
itself, was placed under the sceptre of the Molossian kings;
and some of those princes, Pyrrhus II. more especially, rose to
be mighty conquerors. See below.
[Pg 151]

IV. Grecian Islands.

Both the islands off the coast of Greece, and those of the Archipelago,
all underwent the same political revolutions as occurred
in the states on the main land. But those events did not
take place till after the more ancient non-Hellenic inhabitants,
such as the Ph&#339;nicians, Carians, etc. had been driven out, and
the land had been taken possession of by the Hellenes. In the
more extensive islands, which contained several cities, there generally
arose as many small republics as there were towns, and
those little states were wont to enter into mutual alliances. The
smaller islands, containing but one city, formed each one small
independent state, the territory of which comprised the whole
island. The respective independence of these islands ceased to
exist at the period of the Trojan war; for after the Athenians
had by their success placed themselves at the head of confederate
Greece, and possessed themselves of the sovereignty of the sea,
these smaller states, although called confederates, were treated
little better than subjects, except that their political constitutions
were not changed.&mdash;Among the islands of the Grecian coast, the
most remarkable in history are the following:

a. Corcyra, a colony of Corinth, important for its naval power
and trade, in which it rivalled the mother state itself: a rivalry
which occasioned many feuds and wars, and was even one of the
principal motives that led to the Peloponnesian war. About the
time this struggle began Corcyra had attained the height of her
power, being able, without foreign aid, to man a fleet of 120
galleys. The constitution appears, as at Corinth, to have been
aristocratic, or oligarchical: but after the Persian war a democratic
faction arose, which produced the most violent internal
commotions, and ended in the total ruin of Corcyra.

b. &AElig;gina. This small island was, after the Dorian migration,
occupied by colonists from Epidaurus; it however soon shook
off the yoke of the mother city, and rapidly grew by commerce
and navigation, to be one of the first Grecian states. &AElig;gina was
for a long time the rival of Athens; over whom her naval power
enabled her to maintain a superiority until the time of the Persian
war. Humbled, however, by Themistocles, 485, she could
no longer support herself against the preponderating influence of
[Pg 152]Athens; and although subsequently she made another stand for
independence, 458, the consequences were but an increase of oppression.
Neither must it be forgotten, that &AElig;gina suffered
much, even before the Persian war, from internal broils, caused
by the bitterness of party spirit engendered between the aristocratic
and democratic factions.

C. O. Mueller, &AElig;gineticorum liber, 1817. This treatise
contains not only the political history, but likewise that of trade
and arts.

c. Eub&#339;a. The different cities of this island, Chalcis and
Eretria in particular, had each its separate domestic constitution:
in the two towns above mentioned the constitution was aristocratic,
since the government was in the hands of the opulent,
(Hippobat&aelig;;) nevertheless we hear of tyrants in Chalcis. After
the Persian war Eub&#339;a became dependent upon Athens, which
drew from that island a portion of her supplies and provisions.
The oppression of the Athenians stirred up the minds of the
Eub&#339;ans to rebellion, and the islanders were in the sequel ever
ready to throw up their allegiance when a suitable opportunity
presented itself; such an opportunity was seized in 446, when
the island was recovered by Pericles; and the attempt was renewed
in the Peloponnesian war.

d. The Cyclades were first colonized by Crete, during the
reign of Minos. The Carian race had in earlier times spread
over these islands, but were gradually driven out by Hellenic
invaders, belonging principally to the Ionian and Dorian families.
The most important was Delos, chief seat of the Ionians. Sheltered
under the protection of Apollo, this place became the
centre of an extensive trade, and during the Persian war, 479,
was selected for the treasury of Greece. Next was Paros, famed
for its marble, and for the stand it made against Miltiades, 489,
although it afterwards shared the fate of the other islands, and
passed under the dominion of the Athenians. We know little of
the constitution of the other smaller islands; each of them contained
one city of the same name as the island which constituted
its territory.

e. Crete. The inhabitants of Crete were not pure Hellenes,
but of alloyed origin, such as Curetes, Pelasgi, etc. mingled with
whom were Hellenes, of the Dorian and &AElig;ol&iacute;an stock. In the
earlier periods, Crete had her kings, the most celebrated of whom
were Minos, about 1300, probably first sovereign of the whole[Pg 153]
island; his brother Rhadamanthus, Idomeneus, Meriones, who
followed Idomeneus to the Trojan war, and succeeded him upon
the throne: the last king Etearchus, about 800, after whose
death a republican form of government was introduced. Under
these kings Crete was powerful on sea: to Minos is ascribed the
honour of having by his fleets purged the &AElig;g&aelig;an of pirates, occupied
the islands, and ensured security to the mariner. To him
likewise is attributed the Cretan legislation, the model, it is said,
of that given to Sparta by Lycurgus. But the uncertainty as to
what does and what does not belong to Minos, is in this case
even greater than in that of Lycurgus; many of the laws referred
to Minos are probably nothing more than ancient Dorian institutions.
The insular situation which in some measure ensured
Crete from foreign inroads, and the proximity of Egypt and
Ph&#339;nicia must indubitably have contributed to expand the germ
of political civilization. The abolition of the kingly office seems
to have been the effect of internal commotions, to which Crete
continued to be frequently exposed, even under a republican
form of government. Those commotions originated in the jealousy
between the two largest cities, Gortina and Cnossus, which,
when united, ruled the rest; but when at war, shook the whole
island, until the city of Cydonia, passing over to one of the sides,
gave a turn to the balance. The laws instituted by Minos respecting
private life were enforced in all the cities of the island;
but declined at an earlier period than in the country. Each
city had its own constitution; each possessed it senate, (&#947;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#973;&#963;&#953;&#945;,)
at the head of which were ten censors, (&#954;&#972;&#963;&#956;&#959;&#953;,) chosen from certain
families: these cosmi were not only prime magistrates, but
likewise invested with the command in war, not often, it is true,
waged by the Cretans against other nations, but, for that reason,
more frequently with one another; a circumstance which must
have necessarily contributed to corrupt, not only their constitution,
but likewise their national character.

compilations. New light, however, has been thrown upon the
subject by the inscriptions published in

f. Cyprus. This island, like Crete, was inhabited by a race of
mixed origin, who, even in the time of Herodotus, traced their
descent from Ph&#339;nicians, Africans, (Ethiopians,) from Greeks
out of Arcadia, Attica, and the island of Salamis; of which last
the city of Salamis, founded by Teucer about 1160, was a colony.
There can be no doubt, that in earlier times the Ph&#339;nicians were
for a long period the dominant race in the island; since in the
flourishing days of Tyre the Cyprians rebelled against their
oppressors, at the same time that Psalmanezer led an expedition
against the former city, about 720: moreover, even in the present
day, Ph&#339;nician monuments are still found in the island. From
that time to the Persian period, there appears to have been a close
connection between this island and the Ph&#339;nicians, although the
Cyprians preserved their independence. Several smaller kingdoms
afterwards arose in various cities of the island; the number
of which in subsequent times amounted to nine, and under
Amasis, about 550, were tributary to the Egyptians; and under
Cambyses, 525, to the Persians: notwithstanding this species of
subjection, the various states preserved their own kings. During
the Persian dominion, the Cyprians more than once joined in the
insurrections against the Persians; more particularly the kings
of Salamis, now become the most powerful. So early as the year
500, Onesilus joined the Ionian rebels, but was defeated. In the
wars which afterwards ensued between the Persians and Greeks,
Cyprus was frequently attacked by the combined Grecian fleets;
as in 470 by Pausanias, and during the reign of Evagoras I. 449,
by Cimon, who died at the siege of Citium; yet the Persians were
not driven out, but appear to have kept their footing even after
the peace of 449. Among the subsequent kings of Salamis was
Evagoras II. (400&mdash;390,) who was master of the greatest portion
of the island; but as in the peace of Antalcidas Cyprus was
ceded to the Persians, he was obliged to wage a hot war against
them, in which he lost every thing but Salamis. Finally, the
Cyprians, in 356, took a part in the insurrection of the Ph&#339;nicians
and Egyptians: thereupon the Persians sent an army
against them, under the command of a younger Evagoras, (who
had been banished by his uncle Protagoras,) and under that of
the Athenian Phocion Salamis was besieged, but matters were
made up by a negotiation. The nine small kingdoms of the[Pg 155]
island continued to exist till the time of Alexander, whom they
voluntarily joined during the siege of Tyre, 332, and thenceforward
Cyprus constituted a part of the Macedonian monarchy.


2. History of the Grecian Colonies.

To assist the student in obtaining a general view of the events
connected with the Greek colonies, the history of them will be
here carried on through the subsequent period.

Grecques, Paris, 1815, 4 vols. The most comprehensive
treatise on the subject: it comprises the earlier Pelasgian and the
later Macedonian colonies, as well as those of the Hellenes.
There is much erudition displayed in this work, but sufficient attention
is not paid to the value of the authorities made use of.

review of the subject.

St. Croix, De l'&eacute;tat et du sort des Colonies des anciens peuples,
Paris, 1786. A series of valuable and important enquiries.

Historic importance of the Greek colonies.

1. No nation of antiquity ever founded so many
colonies as the Greeks: these colonies became so
important in various respects, that an acquaintance
with them is indispensably requisite towards
understanding the more early history of the world.
Not only is the history of the civilization of the
mother country and that of early trade intimately
connected with these settlements, but some of
them grew to such power as to have the greatest
influence on political history.

2. The Grecian colonies, to which the following
observations apply, are those founded by the
Hellenes in the time which elapsed between the
Dorian migration and the Macedonian period. It[Pg 156]
appears certain that before the date of that migration
some Pelasgian, and perhaps even some
Hellenic settlers passed over into Italy. The
history of these colonies however is not only involved
in obscurity, but it is besides known that
they ceased after a time to be Greek. The later
settlements of the Macedonians were of a quite
different nature from those of the Hellenes, to
which we now allude.

Hellenic colonies.

3. The Hellenic race spread alike to the east
and to the west of Greece, their settlements, however,
were confined to the shores of the Mediterranean
and Black sea. The countries in which
their principal colonies were established, were
Asia Minor and Thrace in the east; the coasts of
Lower Italy and Sicily in the west. Nevertheless
particular settlements were to be found scattered
here and there on the shores of most other countries.

Origin of these colonies.

4. The Grecian colonies had their origin either
in political motives, being generally made in accordance
with the express command or advice of
an oracle, (for the propagation of the religion of
the parent state was always connected therewith,)
or, in commercial speculations; the former was
the case, almost without exception, with the settlements
made by the mother country herself;
the latter, with those which had branched out of
such colonies as had already exalted themselves
by their commerce. In fact, almost all the Grecian
colonies applied more or less to trade, even
when that was not the sole object of their foundation.

Relations
between colony and metropolis.

5. The connection existing between the colo[Pg 157]nies
and the mother cities was generally determined
by the same causes that led to their foundation.
In those cases where a city had been
founded by malcontent or banished emigrants, all
dependence on the mother country was naturally
out of the question; and even in the colonies established
for the purposes of trade, that dependence
was but feeble and brief; the mother cities
failing in power, if not in will, to enforce it. The
very independence of so many colonies, made (almost
without exception) in countries preeminently
favoured by nature in productions and climate,
and so situated as to oblige the inhabitants to navigation
and commerce, must have given a great
impulse to the civilization of the Hellenic race,
and may be regarded as the main cause of its
rapid progress and wide extension; wider indeed
than that of any other nation of the ancient world.
What a variety of political ideas must have been
formed among a people whose settlements, more
than a hundred in number, had each its own peculiar
form of government.

Importance of the Asiatic Greek settlements.

6. Of the Greek colonies, the most ancient, and
in many respects the most important, were those
along the western coast of Asia Minor, extending
from the Hellespont to the boundary of Cilicia.
Here, ever since the Trojan war, which first
made these countries generally known, Hellenes
of the three great families, &AElig;olians, Ionians, and
Dorians had planted settlements. These were
the most important for trade; and here likewise
in the native country of Homer, the father of Grecian
civilization, of Alc&aelig;us, and of Sappho, poesy,
both epic and lyric, expanded her first and fairest[Pg 158]
blossoms; and hence too, the mother country herself
received the first impulse of moral and cultivated
taste.

1. The &AElig;olian colonies. Their original foundation dates about
1124: they appear to have been a consequence of the Dorian
migration, having been established during that great movement
in Greece. The Pelopid&aelig;, who had been driven out of Peloponnesus,
Orestes, his son Penthilus, his grandson Archelaus,
and his great grandson Grais, successively headed the emigrants,
who proceeded slowly by land, divided, it appears, into several
companies, with which some B&#339;otians and others gradually
coalesced. In Asia they occupied the coasts of Mysia and
Caria; a strip of land which from thence derived the appellation
of &AElig;olis. They moreover possessed the islands of Lesbos,
Tenedos, and the Hecatonnesi. On the main land, in the
quarter named from them &AElig;olis, they erected twelve cities, the
most eminent of which were Cyme and Smyrna; the latter,
however, afterwards fell into the hands of the Ionians. But
their chief settlements were on the island of Lesbos; here they
inhabited five cities, at the head of which, and likewise of
all their other colonies, stood Mitylene. They had likewise
spread inland as far as mount Ida. All these towns were independent
of one another, and possessed their own peculiar forms
of government: our information, however, respecting these constitutions
extends no further than to enable us to ascertain that
they were subject to many disorders, which it was often attempted
to quell by nominating rulers of unlimited power, under
the title of &AElig;symnet&aelig;. These were elected sometimes for a
stipulated period, at others for life; the most celebrated of the
number was Pittacus of Mitylene, who flourished about 600, and
was the contemporary of Sappho and Alc&aelig;us. The &AElig;olians
maintained their independence till the time of Cyrus, with the
exception of Smyrna, which as early as 600, was captured and
destroyed by the Lydians, and not rebuilt till four hundred years
afterwards, when it was restored by Antigonus, and entered upon
its flourishing period. The cities of the main land were compelled
to acknowledge the supremacy of the Persian conqueror;
but not the islands. The &AElig;olian cities were not leagued together
by any permanent bond; it was only in peculiar cases that
they debated in common. Mitylene, which they all regarded as[Pg 159]
their capital, was the only one of their colonies that became rich
by trade, and formidable by its naval power. Yet in 470 it was
tributary to Athens; having seceded in 428, at the time of the
Peloponnesian war, it was recaptured and almost levelled to the
earth by the Athenians.

2. The Ionian colonies. These were, no doubt, founded at a
later period than those of the &AElig;olians; like them, however,
they were a consequence of the Dorian migration. The Ionians,
driven out of Peloponnesus by the Ach&aelig;ans, had withdrawn to
Athens, from whence, sixty years afterwards, that is to say about
1044, they proceeded by sea to Asia, headed by Neleus and others
of the sons of Codrus. They were joined, however, by some
Thebans, Phocians, Eub&#339;an Abantes, and various other Greeks.
In Asia they settled on the southern coast of Lydia and the
northern shore of Caria; which, together with the islands of Samos
and Chios, took from them the name of Ionia. Here they
built twelve cities on the main land; namely, reckoning from
north to south, Phoc&aelig;a, Erythr&aelig;, Clazomene, Teos, Lebedus,
Colophon, Ephesus, Priene, Myus, Miletus, and in the islands,
Samos and Chios. They possessed in common one sanctuary,
the Panionium temple of Neptune, built on the headland of Mycale.
Here they celebrated their festivals, and assembled to
deliberate upon matters affecting the general interest, although
it must still be remembered that each city was in itself independent.
This independence was maintained until the time of
the Lydian dynasty of the Mermnad&aelig;, and that of Cyrus, under
whose reign they were compelled to submit to the Persian yoke.
Still, under the Persian rule, they for the most part preserved
their own form of government, and were subject only so much as
they had to pay tribute. Nevertheless they seized every opportunity
of delivering themselves from this species of thraldom;
and hence their history in the following period is closely interwoven
with that of Greece. The political constitution was, no
doubt, at an early period republican in all; but these colonies
likewise were oppressed by continual factions, and frequently
by tyrants. Among the towns situate on the continent, the
most remarkable were Miletus, Ephesus, and Phoc&aelig;a.  Miletus
was the principal seat of trade. It had been founded by
the Carians before the arrival of the Ionians; but was by the
latter raised to opulence and power. The most flourishing period
of its existence was between 700&mdash;500: in the latter year it was
[Pg 160]implicated in the insurrection of Aristagoras against the Persians,
in consequence of which it was destroyed in 496. From that
time Miletus never recovered its ancient splendour. Nevertheless,
in the days of her prosperity Miletus was, next to Tyre and
Carthage, the first emporium of the world. Her sea trade was
chiefly carried on in the Euxine, and the Palus M&aelig;otis, whose
shores, on all sides, were occupied by her colonies, amounting,
according to some authorities, to more than a hundred. By
means of these settlements she monopolized the whole of the
northern trade in pulse, dry fish, slaves, and furs. Her land
trade was carried on by the great military road, constructed by
the Persians, far into the interior of Asia. Four harbours admitted
her vessels; and her naval power was so great, that she
had been known, more than once, to fit out, unaided, fleets of
from eighty to a hundred sail.&mdash;Phoc&aelig;a. The flourishing period
of this establishment was contemporary with that of Miletus;
but ended at the rise of the Persian dominion, 540, when the
Phoc&aelig;ans, rather than submit to the Persian yoke, chose to forsake
the city of their fathers and migrate to Corsica, although
one half of the inhabitants repented of their resolution and returned.
Phoc&aelig;a had the most extensive trade by sea of all the
Grecian cities; they were to the west what the Milesians were
to the north. Their navigation extended as far as Gades; and
they not only visited the coasts of Italy, Gaul, and Corsica, but
even founded colonies in these countries; as for instance, Aleria
in Corsica, Elea in Italy, and, above all, Massilea, (Marseilles,) on
the coast of Gaul.&mdash;Ephesus. This city was likewise originally
founded by the Carians, but subsequently occupied by the Ionians.
Its independence was maintained until the time of Cr&#339;sus,
who annexed it to his other conquests about 560. The constitution
was aristocratic; the government being in the hands of
a senate, (&#947;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#973;&#963;&#953;&#945;,) combined with the magistrates,
(&#7952;&#960;&#943;&#954;&#955;&#951;&#964;&#959;&#953;):
and the family which had once possessed the throne preserved
certain prerogatives. Ephesus was not so important in a commercial
point of view as Phoc&aelig;a and Miletus; but was much
celebrated for its temple of Diana, which in 355 was fired by
Erostratus, and afterwards rebuilt with more sumptuous splendour.
The flourishing period of Ephesus appears to have commenced
at this time, long after that of Miletus and Phoc&aelig;a had
terminated; for both in the Macedonian and Roman ages Ephesus
was regarded as the first city of Asia Minor.&mdash;Of the cities
[Pg 161]on the islands, Samos was the most important, for its trade,
and for its naval power. The period of its splendour was under
the reign of the tyrant Polycrates, 540&mdash;523, whose sway extended
over the sea and islets of the neighbourhood. Syloson,
brother to the tyrant, having by the assistance of the Persians,
517, obtained possession of Samos, the island was almost depopulated.
Soon afterwards Samos became dependent upon the
Athenians, who in 440 introduced a democratic form of government,
and made it the rendezvous for her troops and fleets
during the war with Sparta.&mdash;Chios was scarcely inferior to Samos,
either in power or wealth. It submitted to the Persian
yoke with the rest of the Ionian colonies; but was so powerful,
that in 500, at the insurrection of Aristagoras, ninety-eight sail
of the combined fleet belonged to Chios. After the defeat of
Xerxes, 469, it entered into the Athenian league, from which it
endeavoured to secede in the Peloponnesian war, 412. The
naval power of the Chians was still considerable; and those
islanders had the high honour of not suffering prosperity to inflate
them with overweening ambition.

F. G. Rambach, De Mileto ejusque coloniis, 1790, 4to.

3. The Dorian colonies. These were situated in Asia Minor,
upon the southern coast of Caria, and in the islands of Cos and
Rhodes, but were all planted at a later period than the Ionian
colonies, and, no doubt, were the result of successive migrations.
The Dorians appear to have gradually spread beyond Peloponnesus,
over the islands of the Archipelago to the Asiatic coast:
in Rhodes they erected the cities of Ialyssus, Camirus, and Lindus;
in Cos a city of the same name; on the main land two
cities, Halicarnassus and Cnidus. These six ancient colonies
had, like the Ionians, one common sanctuary, the temple of
Apollo Triopius, where they celebrated their festivals and held
their deliberative assemblies. Halicarnassus, however, was afterwards
excluded from the confederation. They remained independent
until the Persian period, although the constitutions of
the separate cities were subject to violent revolutions; thus at
Cnidus the oligarchy was converted into a democracy; Halicarnassus
was likewise generally subject to the Carian sovereigns,
among whom Mausolus and Artemisia are names familiar to all.&mdash;The
three cities in Rhodes appear never to have grown to any
importance; that of Rhodes, not built till after the irruption of
Xerxes into Greece, 480, soon eclipsed the others: its flourish[Pg 162]ing
period began after the death of Alexander. At no period of
early history could the Dorian colonies, or those of the &AElig;olians,
compete in wealth and commerce with the Ionians.

7. The shores of the Propontis, the Black sea,
and the Palus M&aelig;otis, were likewise covered
with Grecian settlements. Nearly all these were
colonies of the city of Miletus alone, and were,
without exception, all of them the marts of a
prosperous trade. Although the date of each
cannot be precisely defined, they must have arisen
between the eighth and sixth centuries before the
Christian era. They were not only sovereigns of
the Black sea, but likewise extended their trade
over the whole of southern Russia, and eastward
to the regions beyond the Caspian sea; that is,
to great Bukharia.

On the Propontis stood Lampsacus (adjoining the Hellespont)
and Cyzicus, on an island connected with the continent by means
of bridges. The latter town certainly was one of the most beautiful
and flourishing cities of Asia; but this did not occur until
the Roman age, and was in consequence of the fostering protection
of the Romans.&mdash;Opposite to Cyzicus, on the Thracian coast,
was Perinthus, subsequently called Heraclea; at the mouth of
the Thracian Bosporus stood Byzantium, over against which
was Chalcedon. The prosperity of all these towns affords sufficient
proof of the skill with which sites were chosen for the establishment
of colonies.

Heyne, Antiquities Byzantina: Commentationes du&aelig;, 1809.
The first of which contains the fragments of the earlier history of
Byzantium.

The colonies of the Black sea were: on the southern coast of
Bithynia, Heraclea, in the territory of the Maryandini. This
place preserved its republican constitution amid frequent broils
and revolutions, brought about by the oligarchic and democratic
factions, until about B. C. 370, when the democrats having gained
the upper hand, a path was opened to Clearchus, who became tyrant,
and abrogated the senate, (&#946;&#959;&#965;&#955;&#8052;;) the family of the tyrant
continued for a long time in possession of power, after he himself[Pg 163]
had been murdered by two disciples of Plato.&mdash;In Paphlagonia
was Sinope, the most powerful of all the Grecian settlements on
the Black sea, of which it long held the sovereignty. The freedom
and independence of this place lasted to about 100, when it
fell under the dominion of the kings of Pontus, and afterwards
under that of the Romans. The principal source from which it
derived its wealth were the shoals of migratory fish
(&#960;&#951;&#955;&#940;&#956;&#965;&#948;&#949;&#962;,)
which, issuing from the Palus M&aelig;otis, spread along the shore of
the Black sea down to the Thracian Bosporus.&mdash;In Pontus was
Amisus, the mother city of Trapezus, and which shared the fate
of Sinope.&mdash;On the eastern coast stood the cities of Phasis, Dioscurias,
and Phanagoria: this last was the principal mart of the
slave trade, and, during the Macedonian period, the staple for
Indian commodities imported across the Oxus and the Caspian
sea.&mdash;In the Chersonesus Taurica stood Panticap&aelig;um, capital
city of the little Grecian kingdom of Bosporus, whose kings
(among whom Spartacus, about 439, and more especially Leucon,
about 350, are celebrated) remained in alliance with Athens till
Mithridates the Great laid there the foundation of his dominion.&mdash;On
the northern coast was the city of Tanais, on the mouth of
a river of the same name at the bottom of the Palus M&aelig;otis.
Olbia was situated at the mouth of the Borysthenes. These two
places, and Olbia in particular, were of the highest importance
for the inland trade, which issuing from thence in a northern and
easterly direction, was extended to the very centre of Asia.&mdash;The
colonies of the western coast, such as Apollonia, Tomi, and
Salmidessus, were of less notoriety.

8. The coast of Thrace and Macedonia, washed
by the &AElig;g&aelig;an sea, was likewise covered with
Grecian colonies, from various cities, and especially
from Corinth and Athens. The Athenians
having obtained in the Persian war the sovereignty
of the sea, endeavoured to establish their
dominion in this part of the world; hence the
cities in that quarter were closely implicated in
the quarrels and wars excited, first by the jealousy
between Sparta and Athens, and afterwards by
that which sprang up between Athens and Macedonia,
in the reign of Philip.
[Pg 164]
On the Thracian coast of the Chersonesus, regarded as the
key of Europe, and ranging along the Hellespont, were the
towns of Sestos, Cardia, and &AElig;gospotamos; farther to the west
stood Maronea and Abdera, the latter a colony of Teos. Of far
greater importance, however, were the towns on the Macedonian
coast, Amphipolis, Chalcis, Olynthus, Potid&aelig;a. The first of these
towns, founded about B. C. 464, was a colony from Athens, which
endeavoured to keep it in a state of dependence. Chalcis was a
colony from a city of the same name in Eub&#339;a. In 470 it was
dependent on Athens; but in 432, the inhabitants having raised
the standard of rebellion, forsook their houses and voluntarily
withdrew to Olynthus.&mdash;Olynthus derived its name from the
founder, one of the sons of Hercules: in the course of time it
ranked among the most powerful cities of Thrace, although it was
tributary to the Athenians. It took a share in the war between
Athens and Sparta, and continued to be a flourishing city until
348, when it was taken by Philip of Macedon, and destroyed.&mdash;Potid&aelig;a
was a colony of Corinth, from which it received annual magistrates,
(&#7952;&#960;&#953;&#948;&#951;&#956;&#953;&#959;&#973;&#961;&#947;&#959;&#953;,)
having become tributary to Athens
after the Persian war, it revolted in 431: obliged to yield to the
Athenian arms, its inhabitants were expelled, and their place supplied
by an Athenian colony. It now became a possession of
Athens, and remained so till it was taken by Philip in 358.

9. The Grecian settlements westward of the
mother country were, almost without exception,
made at a later period than those in the &AElig;gean
and Black seas: they reached nevertheless to an
equal degree of splendour; and though their
trade was not so extensive, it was equally profitable:
these colonies not only rivalled those we
have above described, in wealth, but surpassed
them in power, being generally characterized by
the wisdom and prudence displayed in their respective
constitutions. The foundation of most of
them may be dated between B. C. 750 and 650;
consequently at a period when all the cities in
the mother country had already been republicanized:
and at a time when there could be no lack[Pg 165]
of domestic troubles, which would furnish sufficient
motives for emigration.

1. Grecian settlements in Lower Italy. The most numerous
and important of these were scattered around the bay of Tarentum;
they extended likewise along the western coast of Italy up
to Naples. These colonies were variously traced to the Dorian,
Ach&aelig;an, and Ionian families: they were likewise distinguished
by political characteristics, the government in the Dorian settlements
being generally more aristocratic, in the rest more democratic:
it must be observed, however, that, with respect to the
various revolutions which the respective constitutions underwent,
it is hardly possible to give any general information, excepting
so far as regards the earliest times. Of Dorian origin were Tarentum,
and its colonies Heraclea and Brundusium. Of Ach&aelig;an
origin were Sybaris and Croton, together with the colonies of the
latter, Laus, Metapontum, Posidonia; which last founded in its
turn, Terina, Caulonia, and Pandosia. Of Ionian origin were
Thurii, (built on the site where Sybaris had formerly stood,)
Rhegium, Elea, Cum&aelig;, and its branch settlement of Neapolis.
Locri Epizephyrii, a colony of the Locri Ozol&aelig;, may be regarded
as an &AElig;olian city. The most remarkable of these cities in respect
of general history are:

a. Tarentum, founded by the Parthenii, from Sparta, about
707. It waged several wars with the aboriginal tribes in the
vicinity, the Messapians, Lucanians, etc. and grew to be one of the
richest and most powerful of the maritime towns. The brilliant
period of Tarentum appears to have fallen between 500 and 400.
Excess of wealth subsequently introduced luxury, which extinguished
the national spirit. Nevertheless Tarentum preserved
its independence until 273, when, after the war with Pyrrhus,
it fell under the Roman dominion. The constitution was originally
a moderate aristocracy; but was commuted soon after the
Persian war into a democracy, which was, however, curbed by
prudent restrictions. Tarentum had its senate, (&#946;&#959;&#965;&#955;&#8052;,) without
whose consent war could not be undertaken; its magistrates
elected half by lot, half by majority of votes given in the assemblies
of the commons. Among its most celebrated citizens is
reckoned the Pythagor&aelig;an Archytas, who, after the year B. C.
390, was frequently at the head of the state, filling the offices of
general and supreme magistrate. The constitution appears to
have preserved its form until the Roman period, although the[Pg 166]
national spirit was greatly corrupted by a luxury almost exceeding
the limits of credibility.

b. Croton, founded 710 by the Ach&aelig;ans, under the guidance
of Myscellus from Rhype in Achaia. This city must have attained
to very great power during the very first century of its
existence; since in the battle of Sagra against the Locrians,
which may with probability be dated about 600, the Crotoniates
were able to set on foot an army of 120,000 men. Neither does
the defeat which they there suffered appear to have debilitated
the settlement for any length of time; for in 510, with nearly
the same number of forces, they attacked the Sybarites, and destroyed
their city. The original constitution was, no doubt, a
moderate democracy; but we are unacquainted with the details
of its organization. Pythagoras was the reformer of customs,
moral and political, not only at Croton, but in several other of
the Italico-Greek cities. This philosopher arrived at Croton
about 540, and there laid the foundation of the league or secret
association named after him; the object of which was, not to
change the form of government in the Italian cities, but to create
men capable of managing the helm of state. This reform and
influence of the Pythagor&aelig;ans lasted about thirty years, when
their order underwent the same fate as generally befalls a secret
association founded with a political view. Probably about 510
the Pythagor&aelig;ean league was broken asunder by the democratic
faction under Cylon. The consequence was universal anarchy,
not only in Croton, where, about 494, a certain Clinias usurped
the supreme power, but likewise in the other cities: these disorders,
however, were quelled by the intervention of the Ach&aelig;ans;
and the Ach&aelig;an colonies not only adopted the laws of their
mother cities, but likewise soon afterwards signed a league in the
temple of Jupiter Homorius, about 460: it appears that Croton,
having already recovered from the blow it had received, was at
the head of this league. In this happy posture affairs remained
till about 400. After the kings of Syracuse had commenced
their attacks on Magna Gr&aelig;cia, Croton was repeatedly captured;
as in B. C. 389 by Dionysius I. and about 321; and again, in
299, by Agathocles. Finally, after the war with Pyrrhus, 277,
it became dependent on Rome.

c. Sybaris was founded about 720, like the foregoing, by the
Ach&aelig;ans, who were mingled with Tr&#339;zenians: this settlement
existed till 510, when it was destroyed by Croton. Soon after
its foundation it became one of the most extensive, populous, and[Pg 167]
luxurious cities, so much so, that the effeminacy of the Sybarites
became proverbial. Sybaris appears to have been at the height of
her prosperity from about 600&mdash;550; she then possessed a respectable
territory, comprising four of the neighbouring tribes,
and twenty-five cities or places. The extraordinary fertility of
the soil, and the admission of all strangers to the rights of citizenship,
tended to increase the population so much, that Sybaris,
in the war against Croton, is said to have brought into the field
300,000 men. The vast wealth possessed, not only by Sybaris,
but by the other cities in this quarter, was probably derived from
the great trade in oil and wine carried on with Africa and Gaul:
that such was the case at Agrigentum we know with certainty.
The constitution of Sybaris was likewise, it appears, a moderate
democracy: towards the year 510 one Telys took possession of
the supreme power, and drove out five hundred of the optimates,
who fled to Croton. The Crotoniates received the exiles, and
the Sybarites having put to death their ambassadors, a war was
kindled between the two cities, and ended in 510 by the defeat
of the Sybarites and the destruction of their city.

d. Thurii, founded near the site of ancient Sybaris in 446 by
Athens, although the inhabitants were of mixed origin; a circumstance
which gave rise at first to many domestic broils, the
citizens disputing as to who was the real founder; at last, 433,
the Delphian oracle declared the city to be a colony of Apollo.
The constitution was at first a moderate democracy; but this was
soon converted into an oligarchy, all the power and the best lands
having been taken possession of by the Sybarite families who
had joined the settlement. The Sybarites were, however, again
expelled, and Thurii grew into importance by the confluence of
several new colonies out of Greece; its constitution was meliorated
by the adoption of the laws of Charondas of Catana.
The principal enemies of the Thurians were the Lucanians, by
whom they were beaten, 390. The desultory attacks of that
tribe obliged them, 286, to crave the assistance of the Romans,
which soon after afforded the Tarentines an excuse for attacking
them. Thurii now formed a part of the Roman dependencies,
and after suffering much in the Carthaginian wars, was at last,
B. C. 190, occupied by a Roman colony.

e. Locri Epizephyrii. The question of their origin is subject
to dispute: the causes of this uncertainty are, that here, as in
most other of the cities, various bands of colonists arrived at various
times, and those bands themselves were composed of a mix[Pg 168]ture
of several Grecian stocks. The chief colony was sent out,
B. C. 683, by the Locri Ozol&aelig;. After suffering much from violent
internal commotions, Locri found, about 660, a lawgiver in
Zaleucus, whose institutions remained more than two centuries
inviolate. The constitution was aristocratic, the administration
being in the hands of a hundred families. The supreme magistrate
was called cosmopolis. The senate consisted of a thousand
members, probably elected from the commons, with whom resided,
either wholly or partially, the legislative power. The
maintenance of the laws was, as in other Grecian cities, committed
to the nomophylaces. Locri was certainly neither so
wealthy nor so luxurious as the cities above mentioned; but she
was honourably distinguished by the good manners and quiet
conduct of her citizens, who were contented with their government.
The flourishing period of this city lasted till the time of
Dionysius II. who having been driven out of Syracuse, fled with
his dependents to Locri, the native country of his mother: by
his insolence and licentiousness of manners the city was brought
to the verge of ruin; after his return to Syracuse, 347, the Locrians
avenged their wrongs upon his family. Locri afterward
maintained its recovered independence until the time of Pyrrhus,
who, 277, placed a garrison in the town; the Locrians, however,
put the troops to the sword, and passed over to the Roman side:
the city was in consequence sacked by Pyrrhus in 275. From
that time Locri remained a confederate town dependent on Rome,
and suffered much in the second Punic war.

f. Rhegium, a colony from Chalcis in Eub&#339;a, 668: here also
the government was aristocratic, the supreme power being in the
hands of a council of a thousand men, selected only from Messenian
families, which had joined the original settlers. Hence arose
an oligarchy, of which Anaxilaus took advantage to assume the
sole dominion, 494, in which he was succeeded by his sons. These
having been driven out, 464, commotions ensued, which, after a
time, were quelled by adopting the laws of Charondas. Rhegium
now enjoyed a period of happiness, which lasted till B. C.
392, when it was captured and destroyed by Dionysius I. Dionysius
II. restored it in some measure; but in 281 the city was
taken possession of by a Roman legion, who being sent for the
purpose of garrisoning the place, murdered the inhabitants. The
soldiers were punished with death, 271; but Rhegium thenceforth
remained in a state of dependence upon Rome.

g. Cum&aelig;, founded as early as 1030, from Chalcis in Eub&#339;a.[Pg 169]
This city attained at an early period to a high degree of power
and prosperity; its territory being of considerable extent, its
navy respectable, and Neapolis and Zancle (or Messana) among
its colonies. The government was a moderate aristocracy: this
constitution was subverted about 544, by the tyrant Aristodemus;
but restored after his assassination. Cum&aelig; was subject to
repeated annoyances from the petty Italian nations; and in 564
she was invaded and defeated by the Etruscans and Daunians
combined; in 474 she beat the Etruscans at sea: but in 420
was captured by the Campanians; together with whom she became
a dependent of Rome in 345. Cum&aelig;, nevertheless, in consequence
of its harbour of Puteoli, preserved a share of importance,
even under the Roman dominion.

2. Grecian settlements in Sicily. These occupied the eastern
and southern shores of the island: they were founded in the
same period as those of Magna Gr&aelig;cia, and belonged partly to
the Dorian, partly to the Ionian stocks. Of Dorian origin were
Messana and Tyndaris, from Messene; Syracuse, who in her
turn founded Acr&aelig;, Casmen&aelig;, and Camarina, from Corinth;
Hybla and Thapsus from Megara; Segesta from Thessaly; Heraclea
Minoa from Crete; Gela, which founded Agrigentum,
from Rhodes; and Lipara, on the small island of that name,
from Cnidus. Of Ionian origin were Naxus, the founder of
Leontini; Catana and Tauromenium, from Chalcis; Zancle,
(after its occupation by Messenian colonists, called Messana,)
founded by Cum&aelig;, and in its turn founder of Himera and Myl&aelig;.
The most remarkable of these towns in ancient history are:

a. Syracuse, the most powerful of all the Greek colonies, and
consequently that concerning which our information is the most
copious. The history of Syracuse, on which, as that town was
for a long time mistress of the greatest part of the island, depends
nearly the whole history of Sicily, comprises four periods.
1. From the foundation, B. C. 735, to Gelon, 484; a space of
two hundred and fifty-one years. During this period Syracuse
was a republic, but does not appear to have risen to any very
great height of power: yet she founded the colonies of Acr&aelig;,
665, Casmen&aelig;, 645, and Camarina, 600. The assistance of her
parent city, Corinth, and Corcyra, alone prevented her falling a
prey to Hippocrates, sovereign of Gela; and even then she was[Pg 170]
obliged to cede Camarina, 497. The constitution was aristocratic;
but not free from domestic troubles. The administration
was in the hands of the opulent,
(&#947;&#945;&#956;&#972;&#961;&#959;&#953;;) but these were, about
485, expelled by the democratic faction and their own mutinous
slaves. They fled to Casmen&aelig;, and by the help of Gelon, sovereign
of Gela, were restored to their homes; Gelon retaining the
power in his own hands. 2. From Gelon to the expulsion of
Thrasybulus, 484&mdash;466. The three brothers, Gelon, Hiero, and
Thrasybulus, successively ruled over Syracuse. Gelon, 484&mdash;477.
He was at once the founder of the greatness of Syracuse,
and of his own power: this he effected partly by increasing the
population, bringing in new inhabitants from other Greek cities,
and partly by the great victory he won over the Carthaginians,
in alliance with the Persians, 480. At this early period Syracuse
was so powerful, both by sea and by land, as to justify Gelon
in claiming the office of generalissimo of Greece, when Sparta
and Athens came to solicit his aid. His beneficent reign not only
gained him the love of the Syracusans during his life, but likewise
procured him heroic honours after death at the hands of a
grateful people. He died in 477, and was succeeded by his
brother Hiero I. who had till then ruled over Gela. The reign
of this prince was splendid, his court was brilliant, and a fostering
protection was extended to arts and sciences. Hiero's power
strengthened by the establishment of new citizens, both in Syracuse
and its subordinate towns of Catana and Naxus, whose original
inhabitants are translated to Leontini.&mdash;Wars waged against
Thero, 476, and his son Thrasid&aelig;us, tyrants of Agrigentum:
after the expulsion of Thrasid&aelig;us, that town forms an alliance
with Syracuse; the Syracusan fleet sent to the assistance of
Cum&aelig;, wins a victory over the Etruscans. Hiero, dying in 467,
was succeeded by his brother Thrasybulus, who, after a short
reign of eight months, was expelled for his cruelty by the Syracusans
and the confederate cities. 3. From the expulsion of
Thrasybulus to the elevation of Dionysius I.; Syracuse a free
democratic state: from 466&mdash;405. Reestablishment of republican
forms of government in Syracuse and the other Grecian cities;
accompanied, however, with many commotions and civil wars,
proceeding from the expulsion of the new citizens and the restoration
of the ancient inhabitants to their property.&mdash;Increasing
power and prosperity of Syracuse, who is now at the head of the
confederate Grecian cities in the island, and soon endeavours to
convert her precedence into supremacy. The new democratic[Pg 171]
constitution quickly suffers from the diseases incident to that
form of government; a vain attempt is made to apply a remedy
by the introduction of the petalismus, B. C. 454; in the mean
time the Siculi, aboriginal inhabitants of Sicily, unite in closer
league under their leader Ducetius; attempting to expel the
Greeks, 451, they engage the Syracusans in reiterated wars; the
arms of Syracuse are successful, her authority is confirmed by the
subjection of the ambitious Agrigentum, 446, and by her naval
victory over the Etruscans. First but unsuccessful attempt of
the Athenians to interpose in the domestic affairs of Sicily, by
siding with Leontini against Syracuse, 427; eleven years afterward
occurs the great expedition against Syracuse, 415&mdash;413,
caused by the disputes between Segesta and Selinus; the expedition
ends in the total rout of the Athenian fleet and army, (see
below,) and the power of Syracuse reaches its zenith. A constitutional
reform takes place, 412, brought about by Diocles,
whose laws were subsequently adopted by several other of the
Sicilian cities. The magistrates were chosen by lot. The rest
of the laws, which appear to have had reference to the criminal
code, were the production of a committee over which Diocles presided;
these enactments were so beneficial to Syracuse, that the
author of them was honoured with a temple after his death. Yet
as early as 410, a renewal of the differences between Segesta and
Selinus afforded a pretext for war with Carthage, from whom the
Segestani had besought assistance; by this war the whole state
of affairs in Sicily was subverted. The rapid strides made by
the Carthaginians, who, under the command of Hannibal the son
of Gisgo, took, 409, Selinus and Himera, and even Agrigentum,
406, engendered domestic factions and commotions within Syracuse;
and amid those disorders the crafty Dionysius succeeded
first in obtaining the office of general, and then, after supplanting
his colleagues, the sovereign power of Syracuse, 405. 4. From
Dionysius I. to the Roman occupation, 405&mdash;212. Dionysius I.
405&mdash;368. Ominous commencement of his reign, by a defeat at
Gela and the mutiny of his troops.&mdash;A plague wasting the Carthaginian
army, he is enabled to patch up a peace, B. C. 405, by
which it is agreed, that Carthage, besides her territory in the
island, shall retain all the conquests made during the war, together
with Gela and Camarina. But the project of expelling
the Carthaginians out of Sicily, in order to subject the whole
island, and to fall upon Magna Grecia, kindles a long series of
wars both with Carthage and the cities of Magna Grecia. Second
[Pg 172]war with Carthage against Hannibal and Himilco, 398&mdash;392.
Dionysius loses all that he before had conquered, and is himself
besieged in Syracuse; but a plague once more attacking the
Carthaginians, rescues him from his predicament, 396; deeds of
hostility continued notwithstanding till 392, when a peace was
signed, by which Carthage ceded the town of Tauromenium.&mdash;From
394, desultory attacks on the confederate Grecian cities in
Lower Italy, particularly on Rhegium, the chief seat of the
Syracusan emigrants, which, after repeated invasions, is at last
compelled to yield, 387. Third war with Carthage, 383, against
Mago; Dionysius wins a victory, which is however followed by
a greater defeat; and the war ends the same year by the adoption
of a peace, according to which each party is to retain what
he then had; the Halycus is fixed as the boundary line; so that
Selinus and a portion of the territory of Agrigentum remain in
the hands of the Carthaginians. Fourth war: inroad upon the
Carthaginian states; it ends, however, in the signing of a treaty.
The decision of these wars generally depended on the side taken
by the Siculi, the most powerful aboriginal race in Sicily. Dionysius
I. having died by poison, 368, was succeeded by Dionysius
II. his eldest son by one of his two wives, Doris of Locri,
but under the guardianship of his step-uncle Dio, the brother of
Dionysius's other wife Aristomache. Neither Dio or his friend
Plato, who was three times invited to Syracuse, were able to improve
the character of a prince whose mind had been corrupted
by bad education.&mdash;Dio is banished, 360. He returns, 357, and,
in the absence of Dionysius, takes possession of Syracuse, all but
the citadel. Dionysius now has recourse to stratagem; he excites
in the city distrust of Dio, and foments dissension between him
and his general Heraclidas; meanwhile he himself withdraws to
Italy, taking with him his treasures. Dio is compelled to retire
from the city, which is sacked by the troops garrisoned in the
citadel; hereupon the Syracusans themselves fetch back Dio; he
possesses himself of the citadel and wishes to restore the republican
government, but soon falls a victim to party spirit, being
murdered by Callipus, B. C. 354, who usurped the government
till 353, when he is driven out by Hipparinus, a brother of Dionysius,
who keeps possession till 350. After ten years' absence,
Dionysius II. by a sudden attack, becomes once more master of
the city, 346. The tyranny of this prince, and the treachery of
Icetas of Gela, whom the Syracusans called in to their assistance,
but who leagues himself with the Carthaginians, and the for[Pg 173]midable
attempts of the latter, compel the citizens to apply to
the mother city Corinth: Corinth sends to their assistance Timoleon
with a small force, 345. Rapid change of affairs wrought
by Timoleon: he beats Icetas and the Carthaginians: in 343
Dionysius is forced to deliver up the citadel and evacuate the
country; he retires to Corinth, where he leads a private life.
Restoration of the republican government, not only in Syracuse,
where the laws of Diocles are reinstituted, but also in the rest of
the Grecian cities: the revolution confirmed by a great victory
over the Carthaginians, 340. In the midst of the execution of
his plans Timoleon dies, 337, the most splendid example of a
republican that history affords! From 337&mdash;317; almost a chasm
in the history of Syracuse. Wars with Agrigentum; the usurpation
of Sosistratus, disturbs the peace, both external and internal.
The character of the Syracusans was already too foully corrupted
for one to expect that liberty could again be established among
them, without the personal superintendence of a Timoleon. They
deserved the fate that befell them, when, in 317, that daring adventurer
Agathocles assumed the sovereign power, which he
maintained till 289. Renewal of the plan for expelling the
Carthaginians from the island, and subjecting Magna Gr&aelig;cia.
Hence arises a new war with Carthage, in which Agathocles is
defeated, 311, and besieged in Syracuse: by a bold stroke he
passes over into Africa, accompanied by part of his fleet and
army, and there with general success prosecutes the war until
307: the insurrection of most of the Grecian cities in Sicily recalls
him from the theatre of war; his views in Africa are consequently
defeated. In the peace of 306 both parties retain what
they had at the beginning of the war. The wars in Italy are
confined to the sacking of Croton, and a victory won over the
Bruttii; and are rather predatory expeditions than regular wars.
In the year 289, Agathocles died by poison, and his murderer,
M&aelig;non, seized the power; he is expelled by the general Icetas,
and flies over to the Carthaginians. Icetas rules as pretor till
278, when, in his absence, the government is usurped by Thynion,
who meets with a rival in the person of Sosistratus; in the
mean while the mercenaries of Agathocles (the Mamertini) possess
themselves of Messana, and the Carthaginians press forward
to the very gates of Syracuse. The Syracusans invite Pyrrhus
of Epirus over from Italy; that prince takes possession of the
whole of Sicily as far as Lilyb&aelig;um; but having by his haughtiness
incurred general hatred and disgust, he is obliged to eva[Pg 174]cuate
the island, B. C. 275. The Syracusans now appoint
Hiero, a descendant of the ancient royal family, to the office of
general: after defeating the Mamertini he is called to the
throne, 269. At the breaking out of the war between Carthage
and Rome, the new king forsakes his alliance with Carthage,
and, passing over to the Roman side, thereby purchases a long
and tranquil reign until 215, when he dies of old age. Under
this wise prince Syracuse enjoyed a degree of happiness and
prosperity which none of her demagogues had been able to effect.
After his death the Carthaginian party became predominant;
Hieronymus the grandson of Hiero is murdered, 214, and Hannibal's
intrigues enable the Carthaginian party to keep the upper
hand, by contriving to place at the head of affairs his friends
Hippocrates and Epicydes, who entangle Syracuse in a war with
Rome; and the city, after a long siege, celebrated by the inventions
of Archimedes, is brought to ruin, 212.&mdash;The history of
Syracuse is a practical compendium of politics: what other state
ever underwent so many and such various revolutions?

The history of Syracuse was at an early period disfigured by
partiality. For the topography, see &#8224; Bartel's
Letters from Calabria and Sicily, vol. iii. with a plan.

&#8224; A. Arnold, History of Syracuse, from its foundation to the
overthrow of liberty by Dionysius. Gotha, 1816.

Mitford, History of Greece: the fourth volume contains the
history of Syracuse, and a defence of the elder Dionysius. It
would seem that even now it is difficult to write this history in
an impartial spirit.

b. Agrigentum, a colony of Gela, founded 582. The first city
of Sicily next to Syracuse, of which it was frequently the rival.
Its first constitution was that of the mother city; that is to say,
Dorian or aristocratic. It fell, however, soon after its foundation,
under the dominion of tyrants; the first of whom noticed in history
is Phalaris, who flourished probably 566&mdash;534. He was
succeeded by Alcmanes, 534&mdash;488, who was followed by Alcander,
an indulgent ruler, in whose reign the wealth of Agrigentum
seems to have already been considerable. More renowned
than the foregoing was Theron, the contemporary and stepfather
of Gelon; he ruled from B. C. 488&mdash;472: in conjunction with
Gelon he routed the Carthaginian army, 480, and subjected Himera.
His son and successor, Thrasyd&aelig;us, was beaten by Hiero
and expelled, 470; whereupon the Agrigentines, as allies of
Syracuse, introduced a democracy. The period following, 470[Pg 175]&mdash;405,
is that in which Agrigentum, blessed with political freedom,
attained the highest degree of public prosperity. She was one of
the most opulent and luxurious cities in the world, and in the
display of public monuments one of the most magnificent. For
her wealth she was indebted to the vast trade in oil and wine
that she carried on with Africa and Gaul, in neither of which
were those productions hitherto naturalized. In the year 446
the Agrigentines, excited by envy, fell upon the Syracusans, but
were defeated. In the war with Athens they took no share; but
in the Carthaginian invasion of Sicily, 405, Agrigentum was
taken and destroyed; from this blow she recovered but slowly,
and never effectually. By Timoleon she was, in some measure,
restored, 340; and under Agathocles, 307, was able to head the
cities combined against him, but was beaten. After the death
of Agathocles, a tyrant, by the name of Phintias, took possession
of the sovereign power; and was attacked, 278, by Icetas of
Syracuse. At the breaking out of the first Punic war, Agrigentum
was used by the Carthaginians as a military dep&ocirc;t; but was
taken by the Romans as early as 262.

c. The fate of the other Sicilian cities was more or less dependent
on that of Agrigentum and Syracuse: they all had originally
republican forms of government; but though the Ionian
colonies had a celebrated legislator in the person of Charondas,
(probably about 660,) they had the same fortune with the rest,
of being frequently oppressed by tyrants, either from among their
own citizens, or by those of Syracuse, who often used to drive
out the old inhabitants, and introduce a new population more devoted
to their interest: hence must have sprung manifold wars.
The foregoing history shows how grievously they likewise suffered
in the wars between Syracuse and Carthage. Following the
dates of their respective foundations, they may be thus arranged:
Zancle, (after 664, known by the name of Messana,) the earliest,
though of uncertain date; Naxus, 736; Syracuse, Hybla, 735;
Leontini, Catana, 730; Gela, 690; Acr&aelig;, B. C. 665; Casmen&aelig;,
645; Himera, 639; Selinus, 630; Agrigentum, 582. The
dates of the rest cannot be ascertained with any degree of
accuracy.

3. On the other islands and coasts of the Mediterranean we
meet with various insulated Grecian settlements; in Sardinia,
the cities Garalis and Olbia: the date of their foundation unknown;
in Corsica, Alaria, (or Alalia,) a colony of Phoc&aelig;ans
founded, 561; hither the inhabitants of the mother city betook
[Pg 176]themselves in 541; and subsequently, after the naval engagement
with the Etruscans and Carthaginians, withdrew, some to
Rhegium, others to Massilia, 536.

4. On the coast of Gaul stood Massilia, founded by the Phoc&aelig;ans,
who had been driven out of Corsica after the above mentioned
naval engagement, 536; or rather, there was on the same
site an old settlement which was now increased. Massilia rapidly
grew in wealth and power. Our information respecting
the wars she waged on the sea against Carthage and the Etruscans
is but of a general kind. Her territory on the main land,
although rich in wine and oil, was limited in extent; she established,
nevertheless, several colonies along the shores of Spain
and Gaul, among which Antipolis, Nic&aelig;a, and Olbia are the best
known. The trade of Massilia was carried on partly by sea, and
partly by land, through the interior of Gaul. The constitution was
a moderate aristocracy. The chief power was in the hands of six
hundred individuals; the members of this council were called
timuchi, they held their places for life, were obliged to be married
men with families, and descended at least to the third generation
from citizens. At the head of this council stood fifteen
men, three of whom were chief magistrates. As early as 218
Massilia was in alliance with Rome, under whose fostering protection
she grew in prosperity; her freedom was preserved to her
until the war between Pompey and C&aelig;sar; having sided with
the former, she was stormed, 49, by C&aelig;sar's army. She soon retrieved
herself, and, under the reign of Augustus, Massilia was
the seat of literature and philosophy, in which public lectures
were there given as at Athens.

Aug. Bruekner, Historia Reipublic&aelig; Massiliensium. Gotting.
1826. A prize essay.

5. On the Spanish coast stood Saguntum,
(&#918;&#945;&#954;&#965;&#957;&#952;&#8056;&#962;,)
a colony from the island of Zacynthus; the date of its foundation is undetermined.
It became opulent by its commerce; but at the
opening of the second Punic war, B. C. 219, was destroyed by
Hannibal, as being an ally of Rome.

6. On the coast of Africa lay Cyrene, founded at the suggestion
of the Delphic oracle in 631, by the island of Thera. The
constitution was at first monarchical. Kings: Battus I. the
founder, 631&mdash;591. In whose family the sceptre remained.
Arcesilaus I. d. 575. Under the reign of his successor, Battus
II. surnamed the happy, (d. 554,) the colony was much strengthened
by new comers from Greece. The Libyans, bereaved of
[Pg 177]their lands, seek for help at the hands of Apries, who is defeated
by the Cyren&aelig;ans, 570, and in consequence loses his
crown.&mdash;Arcesilaus II. d. 550. Rebellion of his brothers, and
foundation of Barca, an independent town ruled by its own separate
kings. Secession of the Libyan subjects. He is put to
death by his brother or friend Learchus, who in his turn is poisoned
by Eryxo the widow of Arcesilaus. Her son, Battus III.
surnamed the lame, (d. about 529,) succeeds to the throne. The
royal power confined within narrow limits by the laws of Demonax
of Mantinea: the king retains nothing more than the revenue
and priestly office. His son Arcesilaus III. becomes of his
own accord tributary to the Persians; in conjunction with his
mother, Pheretime, he seeks to reestablish the regal supremacy,
but is expelled; nevertheless he regains possession of Cyrene.
In consequence of his cruelty he is assassinated in Barca, about
516. Pheretime seeks for help from the Persian satrap of Egypt,
Aryandes, who by craft gets possession of Barca; the inhabitants
are carried away and translated into Bactria, 512. Soon after
Pheretime dies. It seems probable that another Battus IV. and
Arcesilaus IV. must have reigned at Cyrene, to whom Pindar's
fourth and fifth Pythian Odes are addressed: their history, however,
is veiled in obscurity. Cyrene then received a republican
constitution, probably somewhere about 450; but we are unacquainted
with the internal details of the government. Yet
though Plato was invited by the Cyren&aelig;ans to give them laws,
and though they had for their legislator Democles of Arcadia,
they appear never to have been blessed with a good and stable
constitution. Not only is mention often made of domestic troubles,
as in 400, when amid the uproar excited by Ariston most
of the aristocratic party were cut off; but we likewise frequently
meet with tyrants. Concerning the external affairs of this state
we know nothing but a few general facts relative to the border
wars with Carthage. Subsequently to Alexander, Cyrene became
a part of the Egyptian kingdom; so early as the reign of
Ptolemy I. it was added to that realm by his general Ophellas,
about B. C. 331. It now continued to receive various rulers
from the family of the Ptolemies (see below) until the reign of
Ptolemy Physcon, when it became a separate state, the bastard
son of that prince, Apion by name, having made it over to the
Romans, 97. Cyrene possessed a considerable share of trade,
consisting partly in the exportation of country produce, more especially
the Silphium, (Laser,) partly in a varied intercourse
[Pg 178]with Carthage, Ammonium, and thence with the interior of
Africa. The former splendour and importance of this city and
the neighbouring country are testified by an abundance of most
noble ruins; a more accurate research into which every friend of
antiquity must desire.

THIRD PERIOD.

From the commencement of the Persian wars to the time of
Alexander the Great, B. C. 500&mdash;336.


Sources. The chief writers in this period are: For the history
of the Persian wars to the battle of Plat&aelig;&aelig;, 479, Herodotus.
For the period between 479 and the breaking out of the Peloponnesian
war, we must, in the absence of contemporary authors,[Pg 179]
consider Diodorus Siculus as the principal authority.&mdash;The beginning
of the 11th book, which commences with the year 480,
(the 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th books being lost,) to the middle
of the 12th; the chronology of this author, however, must in
several cases be rectified after Thucydides's summary in lib. i.
For the period of the Peloponnesian war, 431&mdash;410, the history
of Thucydides is the capital work; but it must be accompanied
by Diodorus, from the middle of the 12th book to the middle of
the 13th.&mdash;From the year 410 to the battle of Mantinea, 362,
the principal sources are the Hellenics of Xenophon, and occasionally
his Anabasis and Agesilaus; together with Diodorus,
from the middle of the 13th book to the end of the 15th. For
the years intervening from 362&mdash;336, no contemporary historian
has been preserved; Diodorus's 16th book must therefore here be
considered as the chief source: for the times of Philip, however,
recourse may likewise be had to the speeches of Demosthenes
and &AElig;schines. The Lives of Plutarch and Nepos often touch
upon this period, but cannot be regarded as authentic sources;
of still less authority are the abridged documents given by Justin
and some others.

The modern authors on this, the brilliant period of Greece,
are, of course, the same as have been enumerated above: (see
p. 118.) To whom must here be added:

Potter, Arch&aelig;ologia Gr&aelig;ca; or the Antiquities of Greece:
2 vols. 8vo. Lond. 1722. Translated into German by J. J. Rambach,
3 vols. 1775.

Barthelemy, Voyage du Jeune Anacharsis en Gr&egrave;ce. (Between
the years B. C. 362 and 338.) Paris, 1788, 5 vols. Accompanied
with charts and plans, illustrating the topography of
Athens, etc. This work is conspicuous for a rare union of good
taste and erudition; unattended, however, with an equal share
of critical acumen and a correct appreciation of antiquity.

&#8224; History of the Origin, Progress, and Fall of Science in
Greece and Rome, by C. Meiners. Gottingen, 1781. It contains
also a delineation of the political state of affairs; but does
not extend beyond the age of Philip.

The principal works on the monuments of ancient Greece are:

Le Roy, Les Ruines des plus beaux Monumens de la Gr&egrave;ce.
Paris, 1758, 2nd edit. 1770, fol. The first in point of time; but
far surpassed by:

J. Stuart, The Antiquities of Athens measured and deli[Pg 180]neated;
3 vols. Lond. 1762: the 4th vol. published in 1816.
In beauty and accuracy of execution superior to all.

R. Dalton, Antiquities and Views of Greece and Egypt,
1691, fol. The Egyptian monuments are confined to those of
Lower Egypt.

R. Chandler, Ionian Antiquities. London, 1796, 1797,
2 vols. fol. A worthy companion to Stuart.

Choiseul Gouffier, Voyage pittoresque dans la Gr&egrave;ce,
vol. i, 1779: vol. ii, 1809. Confined principally to the islands
and Asia Minor.

Beneficial
effects of
the Persian
invasion.

1. From a multitude of small states, never
united but continually distracted by civil broils&mdash;and
such at the beginning of this period were
the states of Greece&mdash;any thing important could
hardly be expected without the occurrence of
some external event, which, by rallying the divided
forces round one point, and directing them
toward one object, should hinder them from mutually
exhausting one another. It was the hostile
attempt of Persia that first laid the foundation of
the future splendour of Greece; certain states
then grew so rapidly in power, that upon their
particular history hinges the general history of all
the rest.

Causes which led to the Persian war. Share taken by Athens
in the Ionian insurrection and firing of Sardes, B. C. 500. (see
above, p. 98.) Intrigues of Hippias, first with the satraps, and
afterwards at the Persian court itself.&mdash;First expedition, that of
Mardonius, thwarted by a storm, 493.

Athens and
Sparta
alone reject
the demands
of Persia:
B. C. 491.

2. Not even the summons to acknowledge the
Persian authority was sufficient to rouse the national
energy of the Greeks. All the islands, and
most of the states on the main land, submitted
to the yoke; Sparta and Athens alone boldly rejected
it. The Athenians, unassisted, under their
leader Miltiades, acquainted from his youth with[Pg 181]
the Persians and their mode of warfare, and with
the superiority of the arms of his countrymen, became
the saviours of Greece.

Quarrel of Athens and Sparta with &AElig;gina, which sides with
the Persians, 491; and consequent deposition of Demaratus, king
of Sparta, by his colleague Cleomenes.

Persian expedition of Datis and Artaphernes under the guidance
of Hippias: frustrated by the battle of Marathon, B. C.
Sept. 29, 490, and the failure of an attempt upon Athens.

Expedition
against Paros
by Miltiades.

3. The immediate consequence of this victory
was a naval expedition against the islands, more
particularly Paros, to which Miltiades, out of a
private grudge, persuaded the Athenians. It was
undertaken for the purpose of levying contributions;
and seems to have given the Athenians the
first idea of their subsequent dominion of the sea.
The Athenians punished Miltiades for the failure
of this expedition, although the effect of their own
folly; yet was this act of injustice a source of happiness
to Athens; as the fall of Miltiades made
room for the men who laid the solid foundation of
her glory and greatness.

Internal
state of
Athens.

4.  As usual in every democratic state rising to
power, the history of Athens now becomes that
of eminent individuals, standing at the head of
affairs, as generals or demagogues. Themistocles,
who united to an astonishing degree in his own
person the most splendid talents of statesman and
general, with a spirit of intrigue, and even of
egotism; and Aristides, whose disinterestedness,
even in those days, was singular at Athens, were
the real founders of the power of this commonwealth.
Athens, however, was more indebted to
the first than to the latter.[Pg 182]

Rivalry of these two men, 490&mdash;486. While Themistocles at
the head of the Athenian fleet prosecutes the design of Miltiades
against the islands, the management of state affairs is confided to
Aristides. On the return, however, of Themistocles as conqueror,
Aristides is by ostracism banished Athens, 486. Themistocles
alone, at the head of affairs, pursues his plan for making Athens
a maritime power. In consequence of a war against the object
of popular hatred, &AElig;gina, B. C. 484, he prevails on the Athenians
to devote the income from the mines to the formation of a
navy. While Athens is thus rising to power, Sparta suffers from
the insanity of one of her kings, Cleomenes, (succeeded in 482 by
his half brother Leonidas,) and the arrogance of the other, Leotychides.

Second expedition
of
the Persians
defeated
by
Themistocles:
480.

5. The glory of frustrating the second mighty
Persian invasion of Greece under Xerxes I. belongs
to Themistocles alone. Not only his great
naval victory off Salamis, but still more the manner
in which he contrived to work upon his countrymen,
proves him to have been the greatest
man of the age, and the deliverer of Greece, now
united by one common bond of interest.&mdash;All
national leagues are weak in themselves: yet how
strong may even the weakest be made when held
together by one great man, who knows how to animate
it with his own spirit!

Themistocles' plan for the conduct of the war; first, a common
union of all the Hellenic states; a measure which succeeds to a
certain degree, the honour of the command being left to the
Spartans; secondly, the sea made the theatre of war.&mdash;Gallant
death of Leonidas with his three hundred Spartans and
seven hundred Thespians, July 6, 480. An example of heroism
which contributes as much to the greatness of Greece as the victory
of Salamis. About the same time naval engagements off
Artemisium in Eub&#339;a, with two hundred and seventy-one sail.
The leaders of the Greeks are kept to their posts merely by bribery;
the means of purchasing their services being for the most
part furnished by Themistocles himself.&mdash;Athens, deserted by
its inhabitants, is taken and burnt by Xerxes, July 20. Retreat[Pg 183]
of the Grecian fleet into the bay of Salamis: revocation of all
exiles, Aristides among the rest.&mdash;Politic measures adopted by
Themistocles to hinder the dispirited Greeks from taking flight,
and at the same time to secure to himself, in case of need,
an asylum with the Persian monarch.&mdash;Naval engagement and
victory off Salamis, Sept. 23, 480, with three hundred and eighty
sail, (one hundred and eighty of which were Athenian,) against
the Persian fleet, already much weakened: retreat of Xerxes.&mdash;Poets
and historians have disfigured these events by fanciful exaggerations:
still, however, they may show us how commonly
human weakness is attended with human greatness!

Battles of
Plat&aelig;&aelig; and
Mycale,
Sept. 25, 479.

6. The victory of Salamis did not conclude the
war; but the negotiations entered into during the
winter months with the Persian general, Mardonius,
left in Thessaly, and with the Asiatic
Greeks, to excite them to throw off the yoke,
show how far the confidence of the nation in its
own strength had increased. But by the battle
fought on land at Plat&aelig;&aelig;, under the command
of the Spartan, Pausanias, (guardian to Plistarchus,
son of Leonidas,) and the Athenian, Aristides;
together with the naval battle at Mycale
on the same day, and the destruction of the Persian
fleet, the Persians are for ever driven from
the territory of Greece, though the war continues
for some time longer.

Sparta has
the ascendancy
to 470.

7. The expulsion of the Persians wrought an
entire change in the internal and external relations
of Greece. From being the aggressed the
Greeks became the aggressors; to free their
Asiatic countrymen is now the chief object or
pretext for the continuation of a war so profitable;
the chief command of which abides with
Sparta until B. C. 470.

Athens rebuilt and fortified by Themistocles despite of Spartan
jealousy, 478: formation of the Pir&aelig;us, an event of still[Pg 184]
greater importance, 477.&mdash;Naval expedition under Pausanias,
accompanied by Aristides and Cimon, undertaken against Cyprus
and Byzantium, for the purpose of expelling the Persians, 470.
Treachery and fall of Pausanias, 469. In consequence of the
Spartans' haughtiness, the supreme command devolves upon the
Athenians.

Athens assumes
the
chief command:

8. This transfer of the command to Athens had
a decided effect on all the subsequent relations
of Greece, not only because it augmented the
jealousy between Sparta and Athens, but because
Athens exercised her predominance for a purpose
entirely different from that of Sparta.&mdash;Establishment
of a permanent confederacy, comprising most
of the Grecian states without Peloponnesus, especially
the islands, and an adjustment of the contributions
to be annually furnished by each, with
the view of prosecuting the Persian war, and
liberating the Asiatic Greeks from the Persian
yoke. Although the common treasury was first
established at Delos, the superintendence of it
was confided to Athens; and such a manager as
Aristides was not always to be found.&mdash;Natural
consequence of this new establishment: 1. What
had hitherto been mere military precedence, becomes
in the hands of Athens a right of political
prescription, and that, as usual, is soon converted
into a sovereignty. Hence her idea of the supremacy of Greece,
(&#7936;&#961;&#967;&#8052; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#7961;&#955;&#955;&#940;&#948;&#959;&#962;,)
as connected with that of the sea,
(&#952;&#945;&#955;&#945;&#963;&#963;&#959;&#954;&#961;&#945;&#964;&#943;&#945;.)
2. The oppression of the Athenians, sometimes real, at
other times presumed, after a short time, rouses
the spirit of discontent and contumacy among
several of the confederates: hence, 3. The gradual
formation of a counter league, headed by[Pg 185]
Sparta, who maintains her supremacy over the
greatest part of the Peloponnesus.

consequences
of that
change.

9. The changes introduced into the internal organization
are not to be determined solely by the
palpable alterations made in any of Lycurgus's
or Solon's institutions. In Sparta, the general
frame-work of Lycurgus's constitution subsisted;
nevertheless the power was virtually in the hands
of the ephori, whose dictatorial sway placed
Sparta in the formidable posture she now assumed.&mdash;At
Athens, in proportion as the importance
of foreign relations increased, and amid the
protracted struggles between the heads of the democratic
and aristocratic parties, the real power,
under the outward appearance of a democracy,
gradually centered in the hands of the ten annually elected generals,
(&#963;&#964;&#961;&#945;&#964;&#951;&#947;&#959;&#8054;,) who with more
or less effect played the parts of demagogues.

Abrogation of the law that excluded the poorer citizens from
official situations, B. C. 478.

Expulsion of Themistocles, implicated in the fall of Pausanias,
principally through the intrigues of Sparta: he is first banished
by ostracism, 469, but in consequence of further persecution he
flies over to the Persians, 466.

Brilliant
period of
Athens.

10. The following forty years, from 470&mdash;430,
constitute the flourishing period of Athens. A
concurrence of fortunate circumstances happening
among a people of the highest abilities and
promoted by great men, produced here phenomena,
such as have never since been witnessed. Political
greatness was the fundamental principle of the
commonwealth; Athens had been the guardian,
and the champion of Greece, and she wished to
appear worthy of herself. Hence in Athens alone
were men acquainted with public splendour, exhi[Pg 186]bited
in buildings, in spectacles, and festivals, the
acquisition of which was facilitated by private
frugality. This public spirit animating every citizen,
expanded the blossoms of genius; no broad
line of distinction was anxiously drawn between
private and public life; whatever great, whatever
noble was produced by Athens, sprung up verdant
and robust out of this harmony, this buxom
vigour of the state. Far different was the case
with Sparta; there rude customs and laws arrested
the development of genius: there men
were taught to die for the land of their forefathers:
while at Athens they learnt to live for it.

Athenian
civilization.

11. Agriculture continued the principal occupation
of the citizens of Attica; other employments
were left to the care of slaves. Commerce
and navigation were mainly directed towards the
Thracian coast and the Black sea; the spirit of
trade, however, was never the prevailing one.
As affairs of state became more attractive, and
men desired to participate in them, the want of
intellectual education began to be felt, and sophists
and rhetoricians soon offered their instruction.
Mental expertness was more coveted than
mental knowledge; men wished to learn how to
think and to speak. A poetical education had
long preceded the rise of this national desire;
poesy now lost nothing of its value: as heretofore
Homer remained the cornerstone of intellectual
improvement. Could it be that such blossoms
would produce other fruits than those which ripened
in the school of Socrates, in the masterpieces
of the tragedians and orators, and in the
immortal works of Plato?[Pg 187]

Changes in
the persons
at the head
of affairs.

12. These flowers of national genius burst forth
in spite of many evils, inseparable from such a
constitution established among such a people.
Great men were pushed aside; others took their
places. The loss of Themistocles was supplied
by Miltiades's son Cimon; who to purer politics
united equal talents. He protracted the war
against the Persians in order to maintain the
union of the Greeks; and favoured the aristocratic
party at the same time that he affected popularity.
Even his enemies learnt by experience, that the
state could not dispense with a leader who
seemed to have entered into a compact for life
with victory.

Another expedition under Cimon; and victory by sea and land
near the Eurymedon, B. C. 469. He takes possession of the
Hellespontine Chersonesus, 468. Some of the Athenian confederates
already endeavour to secede. Hence, 467, the conquest
of Caristus in Eub&#339;a; subjection of Naxos, 466, and from
465&mdash;463, siege and capture of Thasos, under Cimon. The
Athenians endeavour to obtain a firmer footing on the shore of
Macedonia; and for that purpose send out a colony to Amphipolis,
465.

Great earthquake at Sparta; gives rise to a ten years' war,
viz. the third Messenian war or revolt of the Helots, who fortify
themselves in Ithome, 465&mdash;455: in this war the Athenians, at
the instigation of Cimon, send assistance to the Spartans, 461,
who refuse the proffered aid. The democratic party seize the
opportunity of casting on Cimon the suspicion of being in the
interest of Sparta; he is banished by ostracism, 461.

Aristides
dies, 467.

13. The death of Aristides, and the banishment
of Cimon, concur in elevating Pericles to the
head of affairs; a statesman whose influence had
begun to operate as early as 469. Less a general
than a demagogue, he supported himself in authority
during forty years, until the day of his
[Pg 188]death, and swayed Athens without being either
archon or member of the areopagus. That under
him the constitution must have assumed a more
democratic character, is demonstrated by the fact
Pericles dies, 429.
of his exaltation as leader of the democratic
party. The aristocrats, however, contrive until
444 to set up rivals against him in the persons of
the military leaders, Myronides, Tolmidas, and
more particularly the elder Thucydides.

Change in the spirit of administration under Pericles, both in
reference to internal and external relations. A brilliant management
succeeds to the parsimonious economy of Aristides; and
yet, after the lapse of thirty years, the state treasury was full.&mdash;Limitation
of the power of the areopagus by Ephialtes, B. C. 461.
The withdrawal of various causes which formerly came under the
jurisdiction of that tribunal must have diminished its right of
moral censorship.&mdash;Introduction of the practice of paying persons
who attended the courts of justice.

With regard to external relations, the precedence of the Athenians
gradually advanced toward supremacy; although their relations
with all the confederates were not precisely the same. Some
were mere confederates; others were subjects.&mdash;Augmentation
in the imposts on the confederates, and transfer of the treasury
from Delos to Athens, 461. The jealousy of Sparta and the
discontent of the confederates keep pace with the greatness of
Athens.

Unsuccessful attempt to support by the help of an Athenian
fleet and troops, Inarus of Egypt in his insurrection against the
Persians, 462&mdash;458.

Wars in Greece: the Spartans instigate Corinth and Epidaurus
against Athens. The Athenians, at first defeated near Hali&aelig;,
in their turn rout the enemy, 458, and then carry the war against
&AElig;gina, which is subdued, 457. In the new quarrel between
Corinth and Megara respecting their boundaries, the Athenians
side with Megara; Myronides conquers at Cimolia, 457. Expedition
of the Spartans to the support of the Dorians against
Phocis; and hence arises the first rupture between Athens,
Sparta, and B&#339;otia. First battle of Tanagra, in which the
Spartans are victorious in the same year, 457. The B&#339;otians,[Pg 189]
incited by the Spartans, are in the second battle of Tanagra
worsted by Myronides, 456. The recall of Cimon, at the suggestion
of Pericles himself, in consequence of the first defeat.

Cimon restored.

450.

449.

14.  Cimon recalled from exile, endeavours to
reestablish the domestic tranquillity of Greece, and
at the same time to renew the war against the Persians.
He succeeds in his attempt after the lapse
of five years; and the consequence is a victorious
expedition against the Persians. He defeats their
fleet off Cyprus, and routs their army on the
Asiatic coast. The fruit of this victory is the
celebrated peace with Artaxerxes I. (see above,
p. 104.) Ere that peace is concluded Cimon dies,
too soon for his country, while occupied with the
siege of Citium.

Termination of the third Messenian war in favour of Sparta,
by the cession of Ithome, B. C. 455. Meantime Athens continues
the war with Peloponnesus; Tolmidas and Pericles
making an incursion by sea on the enemy's territory, 455&mdash;454.
At the same time Pericles, by sending out colonies to the Hellespont,
endeavours to secure more firmly the Athenian power in
that quarter: a colony is likewise sent out to Naxos, 453.&mdash;Cimon
negotiates a truce, which is adopted first (451) tacitly,
afterwards formally, (450,) for five years. The result of this
truce is his victorious expedition against the Persians, and the
consequent peace with that nation. Although the conditions of
the peace prescribed by Cimon were sometimes infringed, they
appear to have been ratified by all parties.

State of
Greece after
the peace
with Persia.

431.

15.  The conclusion of peace with Persia, glorious
as it was, and the death of the man whose
grand political object was to preserve union among
the Greeks, again aroused the spirit of internal
strife. For notwithstanding nearly twenty years
intervened before the tempest burst with all its
fury, this period was so turbulent during its course,
that Greece seldom enjoyed universal peace.[Pg 190]
While Athens by her naval strength was maintaining
her ascendancy over the confederates, and
while some of those confederates were raising the
standard of rebellion and passing over to Sparta,
every thing was gradually combining towards the
formation of a counter league, the necessary consequence
of which must have been a war, such as
the Peloponnesian. Up to this time Athens was
at the height of her power; she was governed by
Pericles, who, in every thing but the name, was
sole ruler during this period, and for that reason
she experienced few of the evils resulting from
a democratic constitution. Who, indeed, could
overthrow a demagogue whose presence of mind,
even in the greatest good fortune, never once deserted
him; who knew how to keep alive among
his fellow-citizens the conviction that, however
exalted they might be, it was to him alone they
were indebted for it?

During the five years' truce the sacred war for the possession
of the Delphian oracle took place, and it is given by the Spartans
to the city of Delphi; but after their return is given back again
by the Athenians to the Phocians, B. C. 448. The Athenians
commanded by Tolmidas, are defeated by the B&#339;otians, 447.
This expedition, undertaken in opposition to the advice of Pericles,
contributes to increase his influence; particularly as he reduces
to obedience the revolted Eub&#339;a and Megara, 446. End
of the five years' truce with Sparta; and renewal of hostilities,
445; further warlike proceedings are repressed by a new thirty
years' peace, which lasts, however, only fourteen years.&mdash;Complete
suppression of the aristocratic party, by the banishment of
the elder Thucydides, 444; the whole administration of the state
consequently centres in the hands of Pericles.&mdash;Democracy in
the confederate states favoured; forcibly introduced in Samos,
which, after a nine months' siege, is obliged to submit to Pericles,
440.&mdash;Commencement of the war between Corinth and Corcyra,
on the subject of Epidamnus, 436, which the Corcyr&aelig;ans take[Pg 191]
possession of after winning a naval victory, 435. The Athenians
take part in the quarrel, and side with the Corcyr&aelig;ans, 432.
The rupture with Corinth, and the policy of Perdiccas II. king
of Macedonia, lead to the secession of the Corinthian colony of
Potid&aelig;a, which previously belonged to the Athenian confederacy:
the war thereby is extended to the Macedonian coast. Engagement
near Potid&aelig;a, and siege of that town, 432. The Corinthians
direct their steps to Sparta, and excite the Spartans to war; which
is further accelerated by the attack of the Thebans upon Plat&aelig;&aelig;,
the confederate of Athens, 431.

Peloponnesian
war,
431&mdash;404.

16.  The history of the twenty-seven years' war,
known by the name of the Peloponnesian, or great
Grecian war, which swept away the fairest flowers
of Greece, is the more deserving attention from
its being not merely a struggle between nations,
but likewise against certain forms of government.
The policy of Athens, which to establish or preserve
her influence in foreign states, excited the
multitude against the higher orders, had on all
sides given rise to two factions, the democrat or
Athenian, and the aristocrat or Spartan; and the
mutual bitterness of party spirit produced the
most violent disorders.

Power and
influence of
Athens and
Sparta.

17.  The respective relations of the two head
states of Greece to their confederates, were at
this time of a very opposite nature. Athens, as
a naval power, was mistress of most of the islands
and maritime cities, which, as tributary confederates,
rendered for the most part a forced obedience.
Sparta, as a land power, was allied with
most of the states on the continent, which had
joined her side of their own accord, and were
not subject to tribute. Sparta therefore presented
herself as the deliverer of Greece from the Athenian
yoke.[Pg 192]

Confederates of the Athenians: the islands Chios, Samos, Lesbos,
all those of the Archipelago, (Thera and Melos excepted,
which stood neutral,) Corcyra, Zacynthus; the Grecian colonies
in Asia Minor, and on the coast of Thrace and Macedonia; in
Greece itself, the cities of Naupactus, Plat&aelig;&aelig;, and those of Acarnania.&mdash;Confederates
of the Spartans: all the Peloponnesians,
(Argos and Achaia excepted, which stood neutral,) Megara, Locris,
Phocis, B&#339;otia, the cities of Ambracia and Anactorium,
and the island of Leucas.

Internal state of
Athens and
Sparta.

18. Sketch of the internal state of Athens and
Sparta at this period. The power of Athens depended
mainly on the state of her finances; without
which she could not support a fleet, and without
a fleet her ascendancy over the confederates
would of course fall to ground. And although
Pericles, notwithstanding his lavish public expenditure,
was able to enter upon the war with
6,000 talents in the treasury, experience could
not fail to show that, in such a democratic state
as Athens was now become under Pericles, the
squandering of the public money was an unavoidable
evil. This evil was produced, however, at
Athens much less by the peculations of individual
state officers than by the demands of the multitude,
who for the most part lived at the expense
of the state treasury. On the other hand, Sparta
as yet had no finance; and only began to feel the
want of it as she began to acquire a naval power,
and entered upon undertakings more vast than
mere incursions.

Financial system of the Athenians. Revenue: 1. The tribute
paid by the confederates (&#966;&#972;&#961;&#959;&#953;)
increased by Pericles from four
hundred and sixty to six hundred talents. 2. Income from the
customs, (which were farmed,) and from the mines at Laurium.
3. The caution money of the non-citizens: (&#956;&#941;&#964;&#959;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#953;.)
4. The taxes on the citizens, (&#949;&#7984;&#963;&#966;&#959;&#961;&#945;&#8054;,)
which fell almost entirely on the[Pg 193]
rich, more particularly on the first class, the members of which
were not only to bear the burthen of fitting out the fleet,
(&#964;&#961;&#953;&#949;&#961;&#945;&#961;&#967;&#943;&#945;&#953;,)
but were likewise to furnish means for the public festivals
and spectacles, (&#967;&#959;&#961;&#951;&#947;&#943;&#945;&#953;.)
The whole income of the republic at
this time was estimated at 2,000 talents. But the disbursements
made to the numerous assistants at the courts of justice (the principal
means of existence with the poorer citizens, and which,
more than any thing else, contributed to the licentiousness of the
democracy and the oppression of the confederates, whose causes
were all brought to Athens for adjudication,) together with the
expenditure for festivals and spectacles, even at this time, absorbed
the greatest part of the revenue.

First period
of the war,
431&mdash;422.
429.
430.

19. First period of the war until the fifty years'
peace. Beginning of the war unsuccessful to
Athens during the first three years, under the
conduct of Pericles, in whose defensive plan we
may perhaps discern the infirmities of age. The
Athenians, however, suffered less from the annual
inroads of the Spartans than from the plague, to
which Pericles himself at last fell a victim. The
alliance of the Athenians with the kings of Thrace
and Macedonia extended the theatre of war; on
the other hand, Sparta had already conceived the
idea of an alliance with Persia.

Consequence
of
the death
of Pericles.
427.
424.
422.

20. The death of Pericles was, for the next
seven years, during which the place of that great
man was supplied by Cleon a currier, followed
by all the evils of an uncurbed democracy. The
atrocious decrees with respect to Mitylene, which
[Pg 194]after seceding, had been recaptured, and the insurrection
of the Corcyr&aelig;an populace against the
rich, characterized the party spirit then dominant
in Greece better than the few insignificant events of
a war conducted without any plan. Sparta, however,
found in young Brasidas a general, such as
are wont to arise in revolutionary times. His prosecution
of the war on the Macedonian coast
might have brought great danger to Athens, had
he so early not fallen a victim to his own gallantry.

Peace not
lasting.
422.

Alcibiades
at the head
of affairs,
420.

21. The peace now concluded for fifty years
could not be of long duration, as many of the confederates
on either side were discontented with
its terms. All hope of tranquillity must have
been at an end when the management of Athenian
affairs fell into the hands of a youth like Alcibiades,
in whom vanity and artifice held the place
of patriotism and talent, and who thought war
the only field in which he could gain credit.
Against him what availed the prudence of Nicias?&mdash;Happy
was it for Athens that during the whole
of this period Sparta never produced one man
who could match even with Alcibiades!

Attempt of some states, Corinth especially, to set Argos at the
head of a new confederacy; this measure Athens likewise favours,
421.&mdash;Violation of the peace, 419; the war indirect until
415, and limited to assisting the confederates on either side.&mdash;Alcibiades's
plan of giving Athens the preponderance in Peloponnesus,
by an alliance with Argos, is defeated by the battle
of Mantinea, 417.&mdash;Exterminating war of the Athenians waged
against the Melians, who wish to preserve their neutrality,[Pg 195]
whereas neutrality in the weaker party now becomes a crime,
416.

Project
upon Sicily.

22. Alcibiades's party brings forward at Athens
the project of conquering Sicily, under the pretence
of succouring the Segestani against the Syracusans.
This rash expedition, in which the
hopes both of the Athenians and of its instigator
Alcibiades were blighted, gave to Athens the first
great blow, from which she never after, even with
the utmost exertion of her strength, recovered;
especially as Sparta also was now become a naval
power.

Early interference of the Athenians with the concerns of the
Sicilian Greeks.&mdash;A fleet and army under the command of Nicias,
Lamachus, and Alcibiades, sent against Sicily, 415.&mdash;Accusation,
recall, and flight of Alcibiades to Sparta: formal rupture
of the peace by an inroad of the Spartans into Attica, where
they fortify Decelea, 414. Unsuccessful siege of Syracuse, 414;
and total annihilation of the Athenian fleet and army by the
assistance of the Spartans under Gylippus, 413.

Athens after
the war
in Sicily.

23. Fatal as in the present circumstances the
blow struck in Sicily must appear to have been
to Athens, yet the calamity was surmounted by
Athenian enthusiasm, never greater than in times
of misfortune. They maintained their supremacy
over the confederates; but the part which Alcibiades,
in consequence of the new posture his
own personal interest had assumed at Sparta,
took in their affairs, brought about a twofold domestic
revolution, which checked the licentious
democracy.

Alliance of the Spartans with the Persians, and indecisive engagement
off Miletus&mdash;Flight of Alcibiades from Sparta to Tissaphernes;
his negotiations to gain the satrap over to the interests
of Athens, 411.&mdash;Equivocal policy of Tissaphernes.&mdash;Negotiations
of Alcibiades with the chiefs of the Athenian army[Pg 196]
at Samos, and the consequent revolution at Athens, and overthrow
of the democracy by the appointment of the supreme
council of four hundred in place of the &#946;&#959;&#965;&#955;&#8052;, and of a committee
of five thousand citizens in place of the popular assembly, 411.&mdash;The
army assumes the right of debate; names Alcibiades to be
its leader; but declares again for democracy.&mdash;Great commotions
at Athens in consequence of the discomfiture of the fleet at Eretria,
and the secession of Eub&#339;a. Deposition of the college of
four hundred, after a despotic rule of four months;&mdash;Reformation
of the government;&mdash;Transfer of the highest power to the
hands of the five thousand;&mdash;Recall of Alcibiades, and reconciliation
with the army.

Brilliant
period of
Alcibiades,
411&mdash;410.

410.

24. Brilliant period of Alcibiades's command.
The reiterated naval victories won by the Athenians
over the Spartans under Mindarus, who,
mistrusting Tissaphernes, now forms an alliance
with Pharnabazus, satrap of the north of Asia
Minor, oblige the Spartans to propose peace,
which haughty Athens, unluckily for herself, rejects.

Two naval engagements on the Hellespont, 411.&mdash;Great victory
by sea and land won near Cyzicus, 410.&mdash;Confirmation of
the Athenian dominion over Ionia and Thrace by the capture of
Byzantium, 480. Alcibiades returns covered with glory; but in
the same year is deposed, and submits to a voluntary exile, 407.

Anabasis of
Cyrus,
407.

406.

406.

405&mdash;403.

25. Arrival of the younger Cyrus in Asia Minor;
the shrewdness of Lysander wins him over
to the Spartan interest. The republican haughtiness
of Lysander's successor, Callicratidas,
shown to Cyrus, was a serious error in policy;
for, unassisted by Persian money, Sparta was
not in a condition to pay her mariners, nor consequently
to support her naval establishment.
After the defeat and death of Callicratidas, the
command is restored to Lysander, who terminates
the twenty seven years' war triumphantly for
Sparta.[Pg 197]

Naval victory of Lysander over the Athenians at Notium, 407;
in consequence of which Alcibiades is deprived of the command.&mdash;Appointment
of ten new leaders at Athens; Conon among the
number.&mdash;Naval victory of Callicratidas at Mitylene; Conon is
shut up in the harbour of that place, 406.&mdash;Great naval victory
of the Athenians; defeat and death of Callicratidas at the &AElig;ginuss&aelig;
islands, near Lesbos, 406.&mdash;Unjust condemnation of the
Athenian generals.&mdash;Second command of Lysander, and last decisive
victory by sea over the Athenians at &AElig;gospotamos on the
Hellespont, Dec. 406.&mdash;The loss of the sovereignty of the sea is
accompanied by the defection of the confederates, who are successively
subjected by Lysander, 406.&mdash;Athens is besieged by
Lysander in the same year, 405; the city surrenders in May,
404.&mdash;Athens is deprived of her walls; her navy is reduced to
twelve sail; and, in obedience to Lysander's commands, the constitution
is commuted into an oligarchy, under thirty rulers, (tyrants.)

End of the
Peloponnesian
war.

26. Thus ended a war destructive in its moral,
still more than in its political, consequences.
Party spirit had usurped the place of patriotic
feeling; as national prejudice had that of national
energy. Athens being subdued, Sparta stood at
the head of confederate Greece; but Greece very
soon experienced the yoke of her deliverers to be
infinitely more galling than that of the people hitherto
called her oppressors. What evils must
not have ensued from the revolutions Lysander
now found it necessary to effect in most of the
Grecian states, in order to place the helm of government
in the hands of his own party under the
superintendence of a Spartan harmost?&mdash;How
oppressive must not have been the military rule
of the numerous Spartan garrisons?&mdash;Nor could
any alleviation of tribute be hoped for, now that
in Sparta it was acknowledged that the "state
must possess an exchequer."&mdash;The arrogance and
rapacity of the new masters were rendered more[Pg 198]
grievous by their being more uncivilized and destitute.

History of the reign of terror at Athens under the thirty tyrants,
403.&mdash;What happened here must likewise have happened
more or less in the other Grecian cities, which Lysander found
it necessary to revolutionize. In all quarters his party consisted
of men similar to Critias and his colleagues, who appear to have
been long before united in clubs
(&#7953;&#964;&#945;&#953;&#961;&#949;&#943;&#945;&#953;) intimately connected
with each other; from which were now taken the most daring
revolutionists, in order to place them everywhere at the head of
affairs.

Expulsion
of the thirty
tyrants.

403.

27. Happy revolution in Athens, and expulsion
of the thirty tyrants by Thrasybulus, favoured by
the party at Sparta opposed to Lysander, and
headed by king Pausanias. Restoration and reform
of Solon's constitution; general amnesty.
It was easy to reestablish forms;&mdash;to recall the
departed spirit of the nation was impossible!

virorum tempore belli Peloponnesiaci inter Gr&aelig;cos illustrium,
rebus et ingenio, Commentatio, Hamburgi, 1820. An inquiry
which exhibits much research and impartiality.

War of the
Spartans
with Persia,
400.

28. The defeat of the younger Cyrus entangles
the Spartans in a war with the Persians, the same
year that, after the death of king Agis, Agesilaus
takes possession of the regal dignity. We willingly
forget his usurpation as we follow him
in his heroic career. None but a man of genius
could have instructed Sparta how to support for
so long a time the extravagant character which
she had now undertaken to play.

Opening of the war with Persia by Tissaphernes's attack on
the &AElig;olian cities of Asia Minor, 400.&mdash;Command of Thimbron,
who, 398, is succeeded by the more successful and fortunate Dercyllidas.&mdash;Availing
himself of the jealousy between Tissaphernes
and Artabazus, he persuades the latter to a separate truce, 397.&mdash;Command
of Agesilaus; his expedition into Asia, from the[Pg 199]
spring of 396 until 394. The conviction which he obtained of
the domestic weakness of the Persian empire in the successful
invasion of Phrygia, 395, seems to have matured in the mind of
Agesilaus the idea of overturning the Persian throne: this design
he would have accomplished had not the Persians been politic
enough to kindle a war against Sparta in Greece itself.

Corinthian
war, 394.

387.

29.  The Corinthian war, waged against Sparta
by Corinth, Thebes, and Argos, to which Athens
and the Thessalians unite, terminated by the
peace of Antalcidas. The tyranny of Sparta, and
more particularly the recent devastation of Elis,
a sacred territory, were the alleged pretexts;
but the bribes of Timocrates, the Persian envoy,
were the real causes of this war.

Irruption of the Spartans into B&#339;otia; they engage and are
routed at Haliartus, 394. Lysander falls on the field of battle;
and Agesilaus is recalled out of Asia.&mdash;His victory at Coronea
ensures to the Spartans the preponderance by land; but the discomfiture
of their navy near Cnidus at the same time, gives to
their enemies the sovereignty of the sea: Conon, who commanded
the combined Persian and Athenian fleets, avails himself,
with consummate skill, of this success to reestablish the independence
of Athens, 393.&mdash;Sparta endeavours by apparently
great sacrifices to bring over the Persians to her interests: the
peace at last concluded by the efforts of the skilful Antalcidas,
(see above, book ii, parag. 42), was readily agreed to by the
Spartans, as they gave up only what otherwise they could not
have retained. The preponderance of Sparta on the continent
of Greece was established by the article which invested them
with the power of seeing the conditions of the treaty fulfilled:
the stipulated freedom of the Grecian cities was but an apparent
disadvantage; and now that the Asiatic colonies were given up,
the contest for power in Greece itself must be decided by land,
and not by sea.

386.

384.

383&mdash;380.

382.

30. The quarrels which, after the peace of
Antalcidas, Sparta began to have with Mantinea
and Phlius, and still more so her participation in
those between the Macedo-Greek cities and the
[Pg 200]over-powerful Olynthus, prove too plainly the arrogance
with which Sparta behaved to the weaker
states. But the arbitrary appropriation of the
citadel of Thebes by Ph&#339;bidas,&mdash;an act not indeed
commanded, yet approved by Sparta,&mdash;was
attended with more serious consequences than
were at first expected. Would that all authors
of similar breaches of good faith and the law of
nations were visited with the same vengeance!

Rivalry of Sparta and Thebes.

31. Period of the rivalry of Sparta and Thebes,
Thebes, from the year 378. The greatness of Thebes was
the work of two men, who knew how to inspire
their fellow-citizens and confederates with their
own heroic spirit: with them Thebes rose, with
them she fell. Rarely does history exhibit such
a duumvirate as that of Epaminondas and Pelopidas.
How high must our estimation of Pythagoras
be, even had his philosophy formed but one
such man as Epaminondas!

Liberation of Thebes from Spartan rule by the successful attempt
of Pelopidas and his fellow-conspirators, 378. Vain attempts
against Thebes, by the Spartans under Cleombrotus, 378,
and Agesilaus, 377 and 376. The defensive war conducted by
Pelopidas, during which he established the Theban supremacy in
B&#339;otia, and brought over the Athenians, (whose fleet, 376, beat
that of the Spartans,) deserves our admiration more than the
winning of a battle.&mdash;The vast plans of Thebes were not unfolded,
however, till Epaminondas was at the head of affairs.

upon the history of Thebes, as the first does on that of Corinth.

General peace in Greece
mediated by
Persia:
374.

372.

32. A general peace is concluded in Greece
through the mediation of the Persians, (who wish
[Pg 201]to obtain auxiliaries against the Egyptians,) under
the condition that all the Grecian cities shall be
free: it is acceded to by Sparta and Athens, but
rejected by Thebes, because she cannot admit the
condition without again falling under the Spartan
yoke. In fact, the lofty language used by Epaminondas,
as envoy to Sparta, shows that it was
problematic whether Sparta or Thebes should
now be at the head of Greece. Could the idea,
therefore, of a perfect equality between the states
of Greece be other than chimerical?

Epaminondas:
371&mdash;362.

33. The long struggle maintained so gloriously
by Epaminondas against Sparta is remarkable
both in a political and military point of view.
The power of Sparta was abased; Epaminondas
invented a new system of tactics, (out of which
soon after sprang the Macedonian art of war;)
and as soon as he found confederates in Peloponnesus
itself, he made his way to the very gates
of Sparta.

Victory won by the Thebans at Leuctra, July 8, 371, and annihilation
of what hitherto had been called the supremacy of
Sparta.&mdash;First irruption into Peloponnesus preceded by alliances
with Arcadia, Elis, and Argos.&mdash;The attack upon Sparta itself
is unsuccessful; but the freedom of Messene is restored, 369.

Sparta in alliance
with
Athens.

34. Sparta in distress forms an alliance with
Athens, under the stipulation that the command
shall alternately be in the hands of the two confederates;
conditions, no doubt, humiliating to
Spartan pride! It however affords them the
means of frustrating Epaminondas's new attempt
on Corinth and the Peloponnesus. Even Dionysius
I. of Syracuse, thinks himself bound to assist
the Spartans as being Dorians.[Pg 202]

35. Thebes played a no less brilliant part in the
north than she did in the south. And had the
attempts to liberate Thessaly from the rule of the
tyrant, Alexander of Pher&aelig;, been attended with
success, Thebes would have received a vast increase
of power. Even in Macedonia she acted
as arbitress.

First and successful expedition of Pelopidas into Thessaly,
368.&mdash;After the decision of the disputed succession to the Macedonian
throne, young Philip is brought as hostage to Thebes, and
educated in the house of Epaminondas.&mdash;Pelopidas is sent as
ambassador, and taken prisoner by Alexander; hence the second
expedition of the Thebans, in which Epaminondas rescues the
army and delivers his friend, 367.

Alliance of
Thebes and
Persia.

36. Alliance of Thebes with Persia successfully
brought about by Pelopidas. In the intrigues
of the opponents at the Persian court, the
object of each was to bring that court over to his
own interest. Yet the domineering tone in which
the Persians wished to dictate peace, had not the
consequences that might have been expected;
and although Sparta consented to her confederates
remaining neutral, she would not forego her
claims on Messene. The establishment of a navy
would have been of more important consequences
to Thebes than this alliance, had not all these
plans, together with the greatness of Thebes, been
365.
swept away by the premature death of her two
leading men.

Last expedition of Pelopidas against Alexander of Pher&aelig;, in
which he himself falls, 364.&mdash;New irruption into Peloponnesus
caused by the commotions in Arcadia.&mdash;Battle of Mantinea, and
death of Epaminondas, June 27, 362.&mdash;General peace in Greece
mediated by the Persians; Sparta does not assent to it on account[Pg 203]
of Messene, but sends Agesilaus to Egypt, there to support the
insurrection of Tachos.

State of
Greece after
the war
between
Thebes and
Sparta.

37. The result of this bloody struggle for the
supremacy of Greece was, that neither Sparta
nor Thebes obtained it; the former of these states
being weakened by the loss of Messene, the latter
by the loss of its leaders, and both strained by
their violent exertions. The situation of Greece
after this war seems to have been thus far
changed, that no state had the predominance; an
independence proceeding from enervation. Even
Athens, who by means of her naval power still
preserved her influence over the cities on the
coast and in the islands, lost the greater part in
the war of the allies, together with three of her
most celebrated leaders, Chabrias, Timotheus,
and Iphicrates, whose places were ill supplied by
Chares.

Confederacy of the islands Cos, Rhodes, and Chios, and the
city of Byzantium; their secession from Athens, 358.&mdash;Unsuccessful
siege of Chios, before which Chabrias falls, 358; of Byzantium,
357. Athens suffers a still greater injury from the
cabals of Chares against his colleagues Timotheus and Iphicrates,
and from her imprudent participation in the insurrection of Artabazus,
356. The threats of Artaxerxes III. force Athens to make
a peace, in which she is obliged to acknowledge the freedom of
her confederates.

Sacred war.
356&mdash;346.

38. At the very time when the growing power
of Macedonia under Philip ought to have united
all the Grecian states, had such an union been
within the range of possibility, Greece plunged
into another civil war of ten years' duration, which
is known by the name of the sacred or Phocian
war. The Amphictyonic assembly, whose duty
it was to maintain peace, and whose influence had[Pg 204]
been in the present circumstances reinstated,
abused its authority by kindling discord. The
hatred of the Thebans, who sought for new opportunities
of quarrel with Sparta, and the ambition
of the Phocian Philomelus, were the real
causes which led to the war, which the policy
of Philip knew how to prolong till the precise
moment favourable to his own particular views
arrived. The treasures of Delphi circulating in
Greece, were as injurious to the country as the
ravages which it underwent. A war springing out
of private passions, fostered by bribes and subsidiary
troops, and terminated by the interference
of foreign powers, was exactly what was requisite
for annihilating the scanty remains of morality and
patriotism still existing in Greece.

Sentence of the Amphictyons against Sparta on account of the
former surprise of the citadel of Thebes by Ph&#339;bidas; and
against Phocis on account of the tillage of the sacred lands of
Delphi, 357.&mdash;Philomelus is elected general of the Phocians; the
rifling of the treasury of Delphi enables him to take into his pay
Athenian and other auxiliaries, and to carry war against the
Thebans and their confederates, the Locrians, etc. under pretence
of their being the executors of the Amphictyonic decrees.
Philomelus having fallen, 353, is succeeded by his brother Onomarchus,
more skilful than himself in intrigue and war: but
Onomarchus having fallen, 352, in the battle with Philip in
Thessaly, is followed by Phayllus. Philip even thus early endeavours
to push through Thermopyl&aelig; into Greece, but is repelled
by the Athenians. He executes this plan after his peace
with Athens, 347, and having procured the expulsion of the
Phocians from the Amphictyonic council, gets their place and
right of vote to be transferred to himself.

Philip's advance
into
Greece.
338.
336.

39. From the very first advance of Philip, the
fate of Greece could scarcely afford matter for
doubt; although the eloquence of Demosthenes
[Pg 205]warded it off until the second invasion, caused by
the Amphictyonic sentence passed on the Locrians.
(See below, book iv. parag. 15.) The
battle of Ch&aelig;ronea laid the foundation of Macedonia's
complete ascendancy over the Grecian
republics: by the appointment of Philip to be
generalissimo of Greece in the Persian war, that
ascendancy was, as it were, formally acknowledged;
nor did it end with the assassination of
that prince.



FOURTH BOOK.

HISTORY OF THE MACEDONIAN MONARCHY.




[Pg 206]
FIRST PERIOD.

From its origin to the death of Alexander the Great. B. C. 800&mdash;323.


Sources. We have no historian who wrote, particularly, on
Macedonia, before the time of Alexander. The facts relative to
the earlier history previous to Philip are collected from Diodorus,
Justin, Thucydides, and Arrian; from Diodorus more especially.
In consequence of the loss of the other historians, Diodorus
is the chief authority for the history of Philip; the
speeches of Demosthenes and &AElig;schines must likewise be consulted,
but not made use of without caution and judicious historical
criticism. With respect to Alexander the Great, as so many
writers on his reign have been destroyed by time, Arrian must
now be considered as the chief authority, on account of the care
he has shown in the selection of his authorities, conjointly with
the seventeenth book of Diodorus. Plutarch's biography contains
several valuable additional facts; and even the superficial Curtius
might furnish us with abundance of information, did his accounts
offer higher claims to our credit.

Origin of
the kingdom:
about
B. C. 813.

1. An Hellenic colony from Argos, headed by
the Temenid&aelig;, a branch of the Heraclid&aelig;, settled
in Emathia, and laid the feeble foundation of the
Macedonian empire, which was in time to rise to
such power. Not only did the settlers keep their
footing in the country, in spite of the aboriginal
inhabitants; but their princes gradually extended
their territory, by subjecting or expelling several
of the neighbouring tribes. Their earlier history,[Pg 207]
not excepting even the names of their kings, is
buried in obscurity till the time of the Persian
invasions.

The three first Macedonian kings, Caranus said to have ruled
twenty-eight years, C&#339;nus twenty-three, Tyrmas forty-five,
were unknown to Herodotus, who names as founder of the Macedonian
monarchy, Perdiccas, 729&mdash;678. Of this prince and
his successors Arg&aelig;us, d. 640, Philip I. d. 602, &AElig;ropus, d. 576,
and Alcetas, d. 547, nothing more is known than that they waged
war, with various success against the neighbouring Pierians and
Illyrians, who had their own kings.

Situation at
the time of
the Persian
invasion.
479.


2.  When the Persians commenced their incursions
into Europe, Macedonia, by its situation,
must have been one of the first countries they
ravaged. Accordingly, as early as the reign of
Darius Hystaspis, the Macedonian kings were
tributary to the Persians; and were indebted for
their deliverance from that yoke, not to their own
valour, but to the victories of the Greeks. The
battle of Plat&aelig;&aelig; restored independence to the
Macedonian kingdom, although that independence
was not formally acknowledged by the Persians.

Immediately after the Scythian campaign, 513, Amyntas
(d. 498,) became tributary to the Persians; his son and successor,
Alexander, (d. 454,) was in the same state of subjection, and
was even compelled to join the expedition of Xerxes.

Situation
after the retreat
of the
Persians.

d. 424.

3. But the expulsion of the Persians still left
Macedonia exposed to the attacks of other formidable
neighbours; on one side there was the
Thracians, among whom, under Sitalces, and his
successor, Seuthes, arose the powerful kingdom
of the Odrys&aelig;; on the other, the Athenians,
who, availing themselves of their extensive navy,
reduced to subjection the Grecian settlements[Pg 208]
on the Macedonian shores. Harassing as these
neighbours were to the Macedonian kings, they
proved to be the very instruments by which Macedonia
became so early and so deeply involved
in the affairs of Greece.

Commencement of the differences with Athens, under the
reign of Perdiccas II, 454&mdash;413; Athens having supported his
brother Philip against him.&mdash;Defection of Potid&aelig;a, and fortification
of Olynthus, into which the Greeks from Chalcis and other
cities are transplanted, 432. Potid&aelig;a being forced to surrender
to Athens, 431, Perdiccas contrives to play so skilful a part in
the Peloponnesian war just now commencing, that he outwits the
Athenians, parrying the attack of Sitalces by a marriage of his
sister with Seuthes, the heir to that prince, 429. His alliance
with Sparta, 424, is very detrimental to the Athenians, Brasidas
wresting Amphipolis from their hands; nevertheless Perdiccas
chooses rather to conclude a peace with Athens, 423, than to
throw himself entirely into the arms of his new allies.

Archelaus
lays the
foundation
of Macedonia,
413&mdash;400.

4. Archelaus, the successor of Perdiccas, introduced
agriculture and civilization among the
Macedonians, who were never, however, recognized
by the Hellenes as their legitimate brethren:
highways and military roads were constructed;
forts were erected; and the court became
the seat of literature. In these days the
Macedonian kingdom seems to have comprised
Emathia, Mygdonia, and Pelagonia, to which
may be added some of the neighbouring tribes,
who, although governed by their own kings, were
tributary. The power of the kings was insignificant
when unaided by the nobles, among whom,
as was the case with all the hereditary princes of
Greece, they merely held the right of precedence.
How difficult was it, even in Alexander's time, to
erase from the minds of the Macedonian nobility
the recollection of their former importance![Pg 209]

5. The murder of Archelaus was followed by a
stormy period, wrapped in obscurity: the unsettled
state of the succession raised up many
pretenders to the throne, each of whom easily
found the means of supporting his claims, either
in some of the neighbouring tribes, or in one of
the Grecian republics.

&AElig;ropus, as guardian to the young king Orestes, usurps the
supreme power, B. C. 400&mdash;394. After his death, and the murder
of his son Pausanias, 393, the throne was seized by Amyntas
II. son of Philip, and brother to Perdiccas II. who was
nevertheless unable to maintain his power until he had gained
a victory over Arg&aelig;us, the brother of Pausanias, who was backed
by the Illyrians, 390&mdash;369. The war with Olynthus, 383&mdash;380,
could not be brought to a successful conclusion until he had
formed an alliance with Sparta.

6.  The three sons of Amyntas II, Alexander,
Perdiccas, and Philip, successively ascended the
throne after the death of their father; but so violent
were the commotions during the reigns of
the two former, that the future existence of Macedonia
as a kingdom might have been regarded
as problematical: it is certain that they were
obliged to submit to the payment of tribute to
the Illyrians.

Alexander, in opposition to his rival, Ptolemy of Alorus,
placed on the throne by Pelopidas, sends his youngest brother
Philip as hostage to Thebes: in the same year he is deposed by
Ptolemy, 368. Reign of Ptolemy, 388&mdash;365, with the stipulation
imposed, 367, by Pelopidas, that he shall only hold the
sceptre in reserve for the two younger brothers. Murder of
Ptolemy, 365, by Perdiccas III. who is nearly overwhelmed
by Pausanias, another and earlier pretender to the crown; he is
at last firmly seated on the throne by the Athenians, under Iphicrates,
364. But as early as 360 he falls in the war against the
Illyrians, leaving behind him a son, Amyntas, still a minor, and
a younger brother Philip, who escapes from Thebes in order to
gain possession of the throne.[Pg 210]

Philip,
360&mdash;336.

7. The reign of Philip, which lasted twenty-four
years, is one of the most instructive and interesting
in the whole range of history, as well on
account of the prudence he displayed, as for the
manner in which his plans were arranged and
executed. Though it may be difficult to trace in
his morals the pupil of Epaminondas, yet it is impossible
to view without feelings of astonishment
the brilliant career of a man, who, under the almost
hopeless circumstances in which he commenced
his course, never lost his firmness of
mind, and who in the highest prosperity preserved
his coolness of reflection.

The history of Philip, even in his own days, was distorted to
his disadvantage by orators and historians. Demosthenes could
not, Theopompus would not, be impartial; and the information
contained in Diodorus and Justin is mostly derived from the
work of the latter.

1740, 2 vols. 8vo. A defence of Philip.

De Bury, Histoire de Philippe, et d'Alexandre le grand.
Paris, 1760, 4to. A very mean performance.

Th. Leland, The History of the Life and Reign of Philip

reading and strict impartiality.

In Mitford, History of Greece, vol. iv, Philip has found his
most zealous panegyrist and defender. It would seem that, even
in the present day, it is impossible to write an impartial history
of this monarch.

8. Melancholy posture of the Macedonian affairs
at the beginning of Philip's reign. Besides
victorious foes abroad, there were at home two
pretenders to the throne, Arg&aelig;us, backed by
Athens, Pausanias, supported by Thrace; and
Philip himself, at first, was merely regent, and
not king. In the two first years, however, every[Pg 211]
thing was changed, and Macedonia recovered her
independence. The newly-created phalanx ensured
victory over the barbarians; recourse was
had to other means than force for success against
the suspiciousness of Athens and the neighbouring
Greek settlements, particularly against the
powerful Olynthus. It is in the conduct of these
affairs that the peculiar sagacity of Philip is displayed.

After the defeat of Arg&aelig;us, peace is purchased from Athens
by a momentary recognition of the freedom of Amphipolis, 360.&mdash;Removal
of Pausanias by means of an accommodation with
Thrace.&mdash;By the conquest of the P&aelig;onians and Illyrians, 359,
the boundaries of Macedonia are extended to Thrace, and westward
to the lake Lychnitis.&mdash;As early as 360 Philip was proclaimed
king.

Policy of
Philip:

9. Development of Philip's further plans of
aggrandizement.&mdash;By the gradual subjection of
the Macedo-Greek cities, he proposed, not only
to make himself sole master in Macedonia, but
also to remove the Athenians from his domain.&mdash;The
first object of his policy against Greece was
to get himself acknowledged as a Hellen, and Macedonia
as a member of the Hellenic league.
Hence the subsequent tutelage in which Macedonia
held Greece was not converted into a
formal subjection, a proceeding which would have
savoured too much of barbarian origin.&mdash;The execution
of all these plans was facilitated by the
possession of the Thracian gold mines, which enabled
Philip to create finances as well as the
phalanx.

Capture of Amphipolis, 358; in the mean while Athens is
amused with promises, and Olynthus with the momentary cession
of Potid&aelig;a, which had likewise been captured: this event is followed
by the conquest of the mountainous districts, abounding in[Pg 212]
gold, which extend from the Nestus to the Strymon, and furnished
an annual income of nearly 1,000 talents.

possesses
himself of
Thessaly:

10. The interference of Philip in the affairs of
Thessaly dates from the year 357; the possession
of that country was an object equally important
for the furtherance of his views upon Greece, as
for the improvement of his finances. He first
stepped forth as the deliverer of Thessaly, and
ended in making it a province of Macedonia.

Expulsion of the tyrants from Pher&aelig;, at the request of the
Aleuad&aelig;, 356; the tyrants, however, receive support in the sacred
war from the Phocians under Onomarchus. The final defeat
of Onomarchus, 352, makes Philip master of Thessaly; he places
Macedonian garrisons in the three chief places, and thus supports
his authority in the country until he is pleased to make it entirely
a Macedonian province, 344.

takes advantage
of
the sacred
war:

11. The protraction of the sacred war in
Greece furnished Philip with an excellent opportunity
of promoting his views upon that country;
although his first attempt at an irruption, too
precipitately undertaken, was frustrated by the
Athenians. The capture of Olynthus, notwithstanding
the assistance afforded it by the Athenians,
after a season of apparent inaction, insured
the safety of the frontiers in his rear; and by a
master stroke of policy, almost at the very moment
in which he was driving the Athenians out
of Eub&#339;a, he found means to enter with them
into negotiations, which, after repeated embassies,
were closed by a peace, opening to him the
way through Thermopyl&aelig;, and enabling him to
raise a party favourable to himself within the very
walls of Athens.

invades
Greece:

12. First descent of Philip into Greece, and
termination of the sacred war by reducing the
[Pg 213]
Phocians. The place which he now obtained in
the Amphictyonic council, had been the height
of his wishes; and the humility of Sparta proved
how firmly his ascendancy over Greece was already
established.

fosters a
party in
Greece;

13.  Brief view of the state of Greece, and more
particularly of Athens, after the sacred war; description
of the means by which Philip succeeded
in creating and supporting parties favourable to
his own interests in the Grecian states. Bribery
was not his only instrument; what he gave he
borrowed from others; the main feature of his
policy was, that he seldom or ever recurred to the
same means. Scheming and consistent even in
his drunken revels, he hardly ever appears under
the same form.

Dreadful consequences to the morals of the Greeks, resulting
from the spirit of party, the decline of religion, and the vast increase
in the circulating medium, produced by the treasures of
Delphi and Macedonia.&mdash;Estimate of the power of Athens during
the period of Demosthenes and Phocion. It seems that, unfortunately,
the eloquence and political acuteness of the former
was not accompanied with sufficient talents for negotiation; the
latter, perhaps, did not place confidence enough in his country,
while Demosthenes placed too much. In spite of public indolence
and effeminacy, Athens was still enabled to support her
rank as a maritime power, the navy of Philip not being equal to
hers.

orations of Demosthenes.

is thwarted
by Phocion;

14.  New conquests of Philip in Illyria and
Thrace. The Adriatic sea and the Danube appear
to have been the boundaries of his empire
on this side. But the views of the Macedonian[Pg 214]
king were directed less against the Thracians,
than against the Grecian settlements on the Hellespont;
and the attack of the Athenian Diopithes
furnished him a pretext for making war
against them. The siege, however, of Perinthus
and Byzantium, was frustrated by Phocion, to the
great vexation of Philip; an event which aroused
the Athenians, and even the Persians, from their
lethargy.

but obtains
the command
in the
second sacred
war;

15. Policy of Philip after this check.&mdash;At the
very time that, engaged in a war against the barbarians
on the Danube, he appears to have wholly
lost sight of the affairs of Greece, his agents redouble
their activity. &AElig;schines, richly paid for
his services, proposes in the Amphictyonic council,
that, to punish the sacrilegious insults of the
Locrians to the Delphian oracle, he should be
elected leader of the Greeks in this new sacred
war. Following his usual maxim, Philip suffers
himself to be entreated.

and falls
upon
Greece.

16. Second expedition of Philip into Greece.
His appropriation of the important frontier town
of Elatea soon showed that, for this time at least,
he was not contending merely for the honour of
Apollo.&mdash;Alliance between Athens and Thebes
brought about by Demosthenes.&mdash;But the defeat
of Ch&aelig;ronea in the same year decided the dependence
of Greece. Philip now found it easy to
play the magnanimous character towards Athens.

Philip's
designs
against
Persia.

17. Preparations for the execution of his plan
against Persia, not as his own undertaking, but as
a national war of the Hellenes against the barbarians.
Thus, while Philip, by obtaining from the
Amphictyons the appointment of generalissimo[Pg 215]
of Greece against the Persians, secured in an honourable
manner the dependence of the country,
the splendour of the expedition flattered the nation
at whose expense it was to be conducted.
It is a question, indeed, whether Philip's own private
views extended much further!

Internal
state of
Macedonia
under Philip.

18. The internal government of Macedonia,
under so skilful and successful a conqueror, must
necessarily have been absolute. No pretender
would dare to rise up against such a ruler, and
the body guard (&#948;&#959;&#961;&#965;&#966;&#972;&#961;&#959;&#953;) established by him at the
beginning of his reign, and taken from the Macedonian
nobility, contributed much to keep up a
proper understanding between the prince and the
nobles. The court became a military staff, while
the people, from a nation of herdsmen, was converted
into a nation of warriors.&mdash;Philip was unfortunate
only in his own family; but the blame
is not to be attributed to him if he could not agree
with Olympias.

Philip murdered,
336.

19. Philip murdered by Pausanias at &AElig;g&aelig;,
probably at the instigation of the Persians, while
celebrating the marriage of his daughter.

Alexander:
336&mdash;323.

20. The reign of Alexander the Great, in
the eyes of the historical inquirer, derives its
great interest, not only from the extent, but
from the permanence, of the revolution which he
effected in the world. To appreciate properly
the character of this prince, who died just as he
was about to carry his mighty projects into execution,
is no easy task; but it is totally repugnant
to common sense to suppose that the pupil
of Aristotle was nothing more than a wild and
reckless conqueror, unguided by any plan.[Pg 216]

St. Croix, Examen critique des anciens historiens d'Alexandre-le-grand,
2nd. edition, consid&eacute;rablement augment&eacute;e. Paris,
1804, 4to. The new edition of this, which is the principal work
on the history of Alexander, and important in more respects than
one, contains more than the title implies, though by no means a
strictly impartial estimate of that prince's character.

Disturbances
of the
Macedonian
court.

21. Violent commotions at court, in the conquered
countries, and in Greece, after the death of Philip.
Great as his power appeared to be, the preservation
of it depended entirely on the first display of
character in his successor. Alexander showed
himself worthy to inherit the sceptre by his victorious
expedition against the Thracians; (to whom,
and more especially to his alliance with the
Agrians, he was afterwards indebted for his light
horse;) and by the example which he exhibited
to Greece in his treatment of Thebes.

Alexander,
generalissimo
of
Greece.

22. Appointment of Alexander in the assembly
at Corinth to be generalissimo of the Greeks.
Yet what his father would probably have turned
to a very different account, he allowed to remain
a mere nominal office.&mdash;Development of his plan
of attack upon Persia.&mdash;The want of a navy, soon
experienced by Alexander, would probably have
frustrated his whole project, had not Memnon's
counterplan of an inroad into Macedonia been
thwarted by the celerity of the Macedonian king.

Battle of the
Granicus.

23. Passage over the Hellespont, and commencement
of the war. The tranquillity of his
kingdom and of Greece appeared to be secured,
Antipater being left at the head of affairs.&mdash;The
victory on the Granicus opens to Alexander a
path into Asia Minor; but the death of Memnon,
which soon after followed, was perhaps a greater
advantage than a victory.[Pg 217]

Battle of
Issus.
333.
332.


24. The victory of Issus, gained over Darius in
person, appears to have given Alexander the first
idea of completely overturning the Persian throne,
as was proved by the rejection of Darius's offers
of peace. When indeed have not the plans of
conquerors been dependent on the course of
events? Yet Alexander must have been pretty
certain of his future victory, since he permitted
Darius to escape, while he sat down seven months
before Tyre, in order to make himself master of
the sea; and, after the conquest of Egypt without
a battle, to which the possession of Tyre opened
the way, to build Alexandria, and erect to himself
a monument more lasting than all his victories.

Although Alexandria perhaps in the end may have surpassed
the expectations of the founder, yet the selection of the site, favourable
only for navigation and commerce, shows that an eye
was originally had to those objects.

Decisive battle of
Arbela.

Oct. 1, 331.

25. Invasion of Inner Asia, facilitated by the
tacit submission of the ruling tribes, and by the
state of cultivation in which the country was
found. On the plains of Arbela the Macedonian
tactics were completely triumphant.  It might
now be said that the throne of Persia was overturned;
and the unexpectedly easy capture of
Babylon, Susa, and Persepolis, was surely of
more importance for the moment than the pursuit
of a flying king.

Insurrection of the Greeks quelled by Antipater; Alexander
himself falls in with the malcontent envoys to Darius in the interior
of Asia.

Persia wholly subjected.

26. The subjection of the north-eastern provinces
of the Persian empire would perhaps have
been attended with the greatest difficulties, had
[Pg 218]not the astonishing activity of the conqueror
crushed in their birth the schemes of the treacherous

Bessus, who, after the assassination of Darius,

been that of the Persian. Besides, the
possession of the rich trading countries, Bactria
and Sogdiana, was in itself an object of vast importance.

During this expedition, the execution of Philotas and his father
Parmenio took place, though both were, probably, guiltless
of the conspiracy laid to their charge, 330. After the death of
Darius, Alexander met with almost constant opposition in his
own army: the majority of the troops fancying that that event
precluded the necessity of any further exertions. Cautious as
Alexander was in his treatment of the Macedonian nobles, we
may discern, not however by the mere example of Clitus, how
difficult they found it to banish from their memory the relations
in which they had formerly stood to their kings.

Alexander
marches
against
India.
328&mdash;326.

27. Alexander's expedition against India had,
no doubt, its origin in that propensity to romantic
enterprise which constituted a main feature in his
character. Yet what could be more natural than
that a close view of Persian splendour, the conquest
of such wealthy countries, and the desire of
prosecuting his vast commercial designs, should
gradually mature in the mind of the Macedonian
king the plan of subjecting a country which
was represented as the golden land of Asia. To
this likewise the scantiness of geographic information
must have greatly contributed; if he pressed
forward to the eastern seas, the circle of his dominion
would, it was supposed, be complete.&mdash;It
appears very certain that Alexander was destitute[Pg 219]
of a sufficient knowledge of the country when he
entered upon this expedition.

Alexander's invasion was directed against Northern India, or the
Panjab; in those days a populous and highly cultivated country;
now the seat of the Seiks and Mahrattas; and then, as now, inhabited
by warlike races. He crossed the Indus at Taxila (Attock,)
passed the Hydaspes (Behut or Chelum,) and, availing
himself of the quarrels between the Indian princes, defeated the
king, Porus. He then proceeded across the Acesines (Jenaub)
and Hydraotes (Rauvee). The eastern verge reached in this expedition
was the river Hyphasis (Beyah;) here, having already
proceeded half way to the Ganges, the conqueror was, by a
mutiny in his army, compelled to retreat. His return was
through the country of the Malli (Multan) as far as the Hydaspes,
when the majority of his troops took ship, and were floated
along that stream into the Acesines, and from thence into the
Indus, which they followed down to its mouth.

Rennel, Memoir of a Map of Hindostan. London, 1793,
(3d. edit.) and

St. Croix, Examen, etc. (see p. 216.) furnish all the necessary
historical and geographical explanations relative to the Persian
and Indian campaigns of Alexander.

Consequences
of
this expedition.

28. Although Alexander was obliged to give up
the project of conquering India, yet the connection
between Europe and the east, which has
continued from that time, was the work of his
hands. While the communication on land was
secured by the establishment of various settlements,
the communication by sea was opened by
the voyage of his admiral, Nearchus, from the
Indus to the Euphrates. In the mean time
Alexander himself proceeded to Persis and Babylon,
across the desert, and the unexplored provinces
of Gedrosia and Carmania.

Nearchus's voyage (our knowledge of which is derived from his
own journal, preserved in Arrian's Indica) lasted from the be[Pg 220]ginning
of October, 326, to the end of February, 325: nearly the
same time was occupied in the almost incredible land march of
the king.

Euphrates. London, 1797, 4to. Exhibiting the most learned
researches, and illustrated with excellent charts.

Alexander's
policy in the
conquered
countries:

29. After the abandonment of India, the whole
circuit of Alexander's conquests was precisely
that of the former Persian empire; his later projects
were probably directed against Arabia alone.
However easy it had been to make these conquests,
it was a more difficult task to retain them;
for Macedonia, exhausted by continual levies of
men, could not furnish efficient garrisons. Alexander
removed this difficulty, by protecting the
conquered from oppression; by showing proper
respect to their religion; by leaving the civil
government in the hands of the native rulers who
had hitherto possessed it; and by confiding to
Macedonians the command only of the garrisons
left in the chief places, and in the newly established
colonies. To alter as little as possible in
the internal organization of countries was his fundamental
principle.

his views.

30. Simple as Alexander's plans were in the
outset, their simplicity was more than compensated
by the magnitude and importance of their results.
Babylon was to be the capital of his empire, and
consequently of the world. The union of the
east and the west was to be brought about by
the amalgamation of the dominant races by intermarriage,
by education, and, more than all, by
the ties of commerce, the importance of which
much ruder conquerors, in Asia itself, soon learnt[Pg 221]
to appreciate. In nothing probably is the superiority
of his genius more brilliantly displayed,
than in his exemption from all national prejudice,
particularly when we consider that none of his
countrymen were in this respect to be compared
with him. To refuse him this merit is impossible,
whatever judgment we may form of his general
character.

Death of
Alexander,
April 21,
323.

31. Sudden death of Alexander at Babylon by
fever; under the peculiar circumstances of the
time, the greatest loss mankind could experience.
From the Indus to the Nile the world lay in
ruins; and where was now the architect to be
found, that could gather up the scattered fragments
and restore the edifice?

Alexander's disorder may be easily accounted for by the hardships
he had undergone, and the impure air to which he exposed
himself in cleaning out the canals about Babylon. He certainly
was not poisoned; and in the charge of immoderate drunkenness
brought against him, we must take into account the manners of
the Macedonian and Persian courts. Was it not the same with
Peter the Great? In estimating his moral character we must
bear in mind the natural vehemence of his passions, ever inclined
to the most rapid transitions; nor should we forget the unavoidable
influence of constant success upon mankind.




[Pg 222]

SECOND PERIOD.

History of the Macedonian monarchy, from the death of
Alexander the Great to the battle of Ipsus, B. C.
323&mdash;301.


To enable the reader to take a general view, the history of the
European events is resumed below, under the head of the history
of Macedonia Proper.

Sources. Diodorus, lib. xviii&mdash;xx. is the great authority
for this portion of history. He compiled mostly, for this period,
from a contemporary historian, Hieronymus of Cardia. He is
followed by Plutarch in the Lives of Eumenes, Demetrius, and
Phocion; and by Justin, lib. xiii, etc. Of Arrian's history of
Alexander's successors, nothing unfortunately remains but a few
fragments in Photius.

&#8224; Mannert, History of Alexander's successors. Nuremberg,
1787. Composed with the usual judgment and learning of that
author.

Measures
adopted at
the death of
Alexander.

1. The very first measure adopted after the
death of Alexander contained within itself the
seeds of all the dire revolutions that afterwards
ensued. Not only were the jealousy and ambition
of the nobles aroused, but even the interference
of the army was exhibited in the most
terrific manner. Although the idea of the supremacy
of the royal family was cast off only by
degrees, yet the dreadfully disturbed state in
which that family stood, rendered its fall unavoidable.

State of the royal family at the death of Alexander. He left
his wife Roxana pregnant, who at the end of three months
brought into the world the rightful heir to the sceptre, Alexander;
he left likewise an illegitimate son, Hercules; a bastard[Pg 223]
half-brother, Arrhid&aelig;us; his mother, the haughty and cruel
Olympias, and a sister, Cleopatra, both widows; the artful Eurydice,
(daughter to Cyane, one of Philip's sisters,) subsequently
married to the king, Arrhid&aelig;us; and Thessalonica, Philip's
daughter, afterwards united to Cassander of Macedonia.

Arrhid&aelig;us and Alexander joint kings:

Perdiccas regent.

Antipater in Europe.

2. The weak Arrhid&aelig;us, under the name of
Philip, and the infant Alexander were at last
proclaimed kings, the regency being placed in
the hands of Perdiccas, Leonnatus, and Meleager;
the last of whom was quickly cut off at the instigation
of Perdiccas. Meanwhile Antipater, with
whom Craterus had been joined as civil ruler, had
the management of affairs in Europe.

Violent revolutions.

3. The sequel of the history becomes naturally
that of satraps, who fell out among themselves,
all being ambitious to rule, and none willing to
obey. Twenty-two years elapsed ere any massy
edifice arose out of the ruins of the Macedonian
monarchy. In few periods of history are the revolutions
of affairs so violent, in few periods,
therefore, is it so difficult to unravel the maze of
events. For this purpose the most convenient
division of the history is into three periods: the
first extending to the death of Perdiccas, 321:
the second to the death of Eumenes, 315: the
third to the defeat and death of Antigonus at the
battle of Ipsus, 301.

Division of
the empire.
B. C. 323.

4. First grant of the provinces made by Perdiccas.
The vanity of this man seems to have induced
him to select the office of regent, in order
that no separate province might fall to his share;
he placed his whole reliance on having the command
of the royal army, although it had already
given so many proofs of its determination to command
rather than to obey.[Pg 224]

In this division Ptolemy son of Lagus received Egypt; Leonnatus,
Mysia; Antigonus, Phrygia, Lycia, and Pamphylia; Lysymachus,
Macedonian Thrace; Antipater and Craterus remained
in possession of Macedonia.&mdash;The foreigner, Eumenes, would
hardly have received Cappadocia, although yet to be conquered,
had Perdiccas been able to dispense with his services. The remaining
provinces either did not come under the new division, or
else their governors are unworthy of notice.

First acts of Perdiccas.

5. The first acts of Perdiccas's government
showed how little dependence he could place on
the obedience of men who hitherto had been his
colleagues. The general insurrection among the
mercenaries who had been settled by Alexander
Insurrection in Upper Asia.
in Upper Asia, and now wished to return to their
homes, was, no doubt, quelled by Python's destruction
of the rebels; but it was not Python's
fault that he did not make himself independent
master of the scene of mutiny.

Disobedience of Antigonus and Leonnatus.

6. Still more refractory was the behaviour of
Leonnatus and Antigonus, when they received
orders to put Eumenes in possession of his province.
Antigonus was too haughty to obey; and
Leonnatus preferred going over into Europe to
marry Cleopatra; there, however, he almost immediately
met with his death in the Lamian war.
(See below, book iv. period iii. parag. 2.) Perdiccas,
therefore, was himself obliged to undertake
the expedition with the royal army; he succeeded

by the defeat of Ariarathes.

but Perdiccas, being obliged, at the request of
the army, to marry Eurydice, Philip's niece, after[Pg 225]

Arrhid&aelig;us, found her a troublesome rival and
opponent in the government.

Antigonus
and Ptolemy.

8. Attempts of Perdiccas to overthrow Antigonus
and Ptolemy, by accusing them before the
army. Antigonus passes over to Antipater in
Macedonia; and gives rise to the league between
Antipater, Craterus, and Ptolemy, against Perdiccas
and Eumenes.

War between the two parties, 321.

9. Commencement and termination of the first
war. Perdiccas himself marches against Egypt,
leaving his friend Eumenes to command in Asia
Minor: meanwhile Antipater and Craterus fall
upon Asia; the former advances towards Syria
against Perdiccas; the latter is defeated and slain
by Eumenes. Before the arrival, however, of
Antipater, Perdiccas, after repeated and vain attempts
to cross the Nile, falls a victim to the insurrection
320.
of his own troops.&mdash;Thus three of the
principal personages, Perdiccas, Craterus, Leonnatus,
were already removed from the theatre of
action; and the victorious Eumenes, now master
of Asia Minor, had to maintain, unaided, the
struggle against the confederates.

10. Second period, from the death of Perdiccas
to that of Eumenes.&mdash;Python and Arrhid&aelig;us
quickly resigning the regency, it is assumed by
Antipater.&mdash;New division of the provinces at Trisparadisus
in Syria. Seleucus receives Babylon;
Antigonus is promised, besides his former possessions,
all those of the outlawed Eumenes.

11. War of Antigonus with Eumenes. The latter,
defeated by treachery, shuts himself up in the
mountain fastness of Nora, there to await more[Pg 226]
favourable times; and Antigonus remains master
of all Asia Minor: in the mean time Ptolemy
ventures to take possession of Syria and Ph&#339;nicia.

Antipater dies. 320.

Polysperchon regent.

319.

12. Death of the regent Antipater, in the same
year, (320;) he bequeaths the regency to his friend,
the aged Polysperchon, to the exclusion of his own
son Cassander. Antigonus now begins to unfold
his ambitious plans; he endeavours vainly to win
over Eumenes, who deceives him in the negotiations,
and seizes the opportunity of leaving his
mountain fastness.

13. Eumenes's plan to strengthen himself in
Upper Asia; as he is on the way he receives
tidings of his being appointed generalissimo of the
royal troops. What better man could Polysperchon
have selected for the office than he who in
his conduct towards Antigonus exhibited so striking
an example of attachment to the royal house?

318.

14. Exertions of Eumenes to maintain himself
in Lower Asia, ineffectual, the naval victory
won by Antigonus over the royal fleet, commanded
by Clitus, depriving him of the empire
of the sea. He bursts into Upper Asia; where,
in the spring, he unites with the satraps, who had
317.
taken arms against the powerful Seleucus of Babylon.

15. Antigonus following up the royal general,
Upper Asia becomes the theatre of war. Victorious
as was at first the stand made by Eumenes,
neither valour nor talent were of any avail against
the insubordination of the royal troops, and the
jealousy of the other commanders. Attacked in
winter quarters by Antigonus, he was, after the
battle, delivered into the hands of his enemy by
[Pg 227]the mutinous Argyraspid&aelig;, who had lost their
315.
baggage: he was put to death, and in him the
king's family lost its only loyal supporter.

317.

315.

315&mdash;301.

16. Great changes had also taken place in the
royal family. Her enemy Antipater having deceased,
Olympias, invited by Polysperchon, who
wished to strengthen himself against Cassander,
had returned from Epirus, and put to death Arrhid&aelig;us
together with his wife, Eurydice: in the
year following she was besieged in Pydna by
Cassander, and being obliged to surrender, was
in her turn executed; meanwhile Cassander held
Roxana and the young king in his own power.

Predominance of Antigonus.


17. Third period, from the death of Eumenes
to that of Antigonus.&mdash;The rout of Eumenes
seemed to have established for ever the power of
Antigonus in Asia; still animated with the fire of
youth, though full of years, he saw himself revived
in his son Demetrius, fond of boisterous
revelry, but gallant and talented.&mdash;Even Seleucus
315.
thought it time to consult his safety by flying
from Babylon into Egypt.

18. Changes introduced by Antigonus into the
upper provinces; return to Asia Minor, where his
presence seemed indispensable, by reason of the
aggrandizement of Ptolemy in Syria and Ph&#339;nicia,
of the Macedonian Cassander in Europe,
of Lysimachus in Mysia, and the Carian Cassander
in Asia Minor.&mdash;He repossesses himself of
Ph&#339;nicia, a country of the first importance for
the construction of a fleet.

Siege of Tyre, 314&mdash;313: it lasts fourteen months; a proof
that the city was certainly not razed by Alexander.

19. The fugitive Seleucus forms a league[Pg 228]
against Antigonus and Demetrius, between Ptolemy,
the two Cassanders, and Lysimachus. But
Antigonus frustrates their combination, himself
driving out the Carian Cassander, and his son
marching against Ptolemy.

Victory won by Ptolemy over Demetrius at Gaza, 312; after
which Seleucus marches back to Babylon, and, although subsequently
followed up by Demetrius, permanently maintains his
footing in Upper Asia.&mdash;On the other hand, Ptolemy, at the first
approach of Antigonus with the main body, surrenders back Syria
and Ph&#339;nicia, 312.

Peace
concluded,
311.

20. A general peace concluded between Antigonus
and his enemies, Seleucus only excepted,
from whom Upper Asia is to be again wrested.
The first article, that each should retain what he
had, demonstrates pretty evidently that the treaty
was dictated solely by Antigonus; the second,
that the Greek cities should be free, was pregnant
with the seeds of a new war, ready to burst
forth at every favourable opportunity; the third,
that the young Alexander should be raised to the
throne upon attaining his majority, was probably
the death warrant of the hapless prince, who, that
same year, together with his mother, was murdered
by Cassander.&mdash;Shortly after, at the instigation
of Antigonus, Cleopatra was put to death,
in order that Ptolemy might be thwarted in his
object, which depended on a matrimonial connection
with that princess.

Disputes on
the liberation
of
Greece.

21. Even the execution of the articles must
have given rise to hostilities; Ptolemy wishing
to force Antigonus, and he, on his side, to compel
Cassander, to withdraw the garrisons from the
Grecian towns; a condition which neither party
felt inclined to fulfil. Grecian freedom was now[Pg 229]
but a name; this, however, is not the only example
history furnishes of political ideas making
the greatest stir long after they have survived
their own existence; for then they become excellent
tools in the hands of artful designers.

Expedition of Demetrius to liberate Athens, 308. The day
when he announced freedom to the Athenians, must have been
the happiest of his life! Few portions of history present such a
scope for the contemplation of human nature as the twofold sojourn
of Demetrius at Athens.

22.  The growing power of Ptolemy on the
sea, and the capture of Cyprus, determines Antigonus
to an open rupture: he commands his son
to drive Ptolemy out of the island.

Naval victory of Demetrius off Cyprus, 307, perhaps the
greatest and most bloody in history; nevertheless, as little decisive
to the general question as are most naval battles. The assumption
of the royal title, first by the conqueror, afterwards by
the conquered, and ultimately by all the rest, was but a mere
form now that the royal family was extirpated.

Rhodes besieged.

23.  The conquerors having failed in their project
of subduing Egypt, made the wealthy republic
of the Rhodians, as an ally of that country,
the victim of their fury. But though in the renowned
siege of their capital, Demetrius earned
305.
his title of Poliorcetes, the noble defence of the
Rhodians afforded an illustrious example of the
power of discipline in conjunction with well-guided
patriotism. The invitation of the Athenians
came seasonably to Demetrius; he raised
the blockade and proceeded to complete the
304.
liberation of Greece, the necessity of which became
every day more pressing.

Demetrius
again visits
Greece.

24.  Second sojourn of Demetrius in Greece.
The expulsion of Cassander's garrisons from the[Pg 230]
Grecian cities, and more particularly from those
in Peloponnesus; the appointment of Demetrius
as generalissimo of Greece, for the conquest of
Macedonia and Thrace; proved not only to Cassander,
but also to the other princes, that their
common interest loudly called upon them to resist
the over-powerful Antigonus.

League
against
Antigonus,
302.

25. Third grand league of Cassander, Ptolemy,
and Seleucus, against Antigonus and his son;
brought about by Cassander. How easily, even
after the violent irruption of Lysimachus into
Asia Minor, might Antigonus have dispersed the
gathering storms, had not his presumption led
him to place an overweening reliance on his own
good fortune!

Junction of
Seleucus
and Lysimachus,
301.

26. Junction of Seleucus of Babylon and Lysimachus,
in Phrygia. Antigonus, to concentrate
his forces, recalls his son, who had pushed
on to the borders of Macedonia. The cautious
Ptolemy, on the other hand, is afraid to invade
Syria; and, in consequence of a false report, that
Lysimachus had been defeated, retires full of
alarm, into Egypt.

Battle of
Ipsus,
301.

27. Great and decisive battle fought at Ipsus
in Phrygia, in the spring of 301, which costs Antigonus
his life, and annihilates his empire, as
the two conquerors divide it between themselves,
without taking any account of the absent confederates.
Asia Minor, as far as mount Taurus,
falls to the share of Lysimachus; and all the rest,
with the exception of Cilicia, which is given to
Plisthenes, Cassander's brother, is left to Seleucus.&mdash;Demetrius,
by the help of his navy,
escapes into Greece.[Pg 231]

Domestic organization
of the
monarchy.

28. The almost unbroken series of wars which
had raged from the time of Alexander, must have
precluded the possibility of much being effected
with respect to domestic organization. It appears
to have been nearly, if not wholly, military.
Yet were the numerous devastations in some
measure compensated by the erection of new cities,
in which these princes vied with one another,
impelled partly by vanity to immortalize
their names, partly by policy to support their dominion,
most of the new settlements being military
colonies. Nevertheless this was but a sorry
reparation for the manifold oppressions to which
the natives were exposed by the practice of quartering
the army upon them. The spread of the
language and civilization of the Greeks deprived
them of all national distinction; their own languages
sinking into mere provincial dialects.
Alexander's monarchy affords a striking example
of the little that can be expected from a forced
amalgamation of races, when the price of that
amalgamation is the obliteration of national character
in the individuals.

[Pg 232]

THIRD PERIOD.

History of the kingdoms and states which arose upon the
dismemberment of the
Macedonian Monarchy after the battle of Ipsus.


I. History of the Syrian empire under the Seleucid&aelig;,
B. C. 312&mdash;64.

Sources. Neither for the history of the Syrian, nor for that
of the Egyptian and Macedonian kingdoms, has any eminent
writer been preserved. The fragments of the lost books of Diodorus,
and, from the time that these kingdoms became allies of
Rome, those of Polybius, several narratives of Livy, the Syriaca
of Appian, and a few of Plutarch's Lives, are the principal authorities;
too frequently we are obliged to rely upon the extracts
of Justin. For the history of the Seleucid&aelig;, in consequence of
the political connection between these princes and the Jews, the
Antiquities of Josephus and the book of Maccabees become of
importance. Besides these authorities, the many coins that have
been preserved of these kings, afford much information respecting
their genealogy and chronology.

Of modern publications on the subject, the principal work is

Vaillant, Imperium Seleucidarum sive historia regum Syri&aelig;,
1681, 4to. The enquiry is principally grounded on coins, as is
the case with

Froelich, Annales rerum et regum Syri&aelig;. Vienn&aelig;, 1754.

Seleucus
Nicator,

1. The kingdom of the Seleucid&aelig; was founded
in Upper Asia by Seleucus Nicator. It was an
extensive empire; but, being composed of various
countries united only by conquest, it could possess
but little internal stability except what it derived
from the power of its rulers. That power fell
with the founder; and the transfer of the seat of[Pg 233]
empire from the banks of the Tigris to Syria, entangled
the Seleucid&aelig; in all the political disputes
of the western world, and facilitated the insurrection
of the upper provinces. The history of this
kingdom divides itself into the periods before and
after the war with Rome; although at the breaking
out of this war the seeds of its decline and
fall had already been sown.

Seleucus received, 321, Babylon as his province; but after the
defeat of Eumenes was obliged to take to flight, 315, in order to
avoid subjection to the conqueror Antigonus. But his moderate
government had rendered him so popular, that after the victory
won by Ptolemy over Demetrius at Gaza, 312, he could safely
venture to return with only a few adherents to Babylon. In this
year commences the kingdom of the Seleucid&aelig;.

founds the kingdom of the Seleucid&aelig;.

B. C. 313.

311.

2. In the ten following years, and while Antigonus
was busied in Asia Minor, Seleucus laid
the foundation of his power over all Upper Asia,
with a facility to which the detestation excited
by the rigid government of Antigonus mainly contributed.
After his victory over Nicanor of
Media, all in that quarter declared spontaneously
for him; and the unsuccessful expedition of Demetrius
taught Antigonus himself, that it would
no longer be prudent to assert his claims. As
early as 307, Seleucus was in possession of all
the countries between the Euphrates, Indus, and
Oxus.

Campaign
against
India,
305.

3. Great campaign in India undertaken by Seleucus
against king Sandracottus. He penetrated
as far as the Ganges, and the close alliance he
formed with the Indian sovereign lasted a long
time after, and was kept up by embassies. The
great number of elephants which he brought back[Pg 234]
with him was not the only advantage accruing
from this expedition; the intercourse with the
east seems to have been permanently reestablished.

Seat of government
removed
into Syria,
301.

4. By the battle of Ipsus Seleucus added to
his dominions the greater part of the territories
of Antigonus;&mdash;Syria, Cappadocia, Mesopotamia,
and Armenia. Unfortunately Syria now became
the head province, notwithstanding C&#339;le-Syria
and Ph&#339;nicia were left in the hands of Ptolemy.
How widely different would have been the course
of historic events, had the seat of empire remained
at Seleucia on the Tigris, and the Euphrates
continued to be the western boundary of
the Seleucid&aelig;!

5. Reciprocal relations between the several
kings, who now combine in forming a kind of political
system, in which continued exertions to
maintain a balance of power by alliance and marriage
are plainly discernible.

Connection between Seleucus and Demetrius Poliorcetes, by
the marriage of the former with the beautiful Stratonice, daughter
of the latter; made with the view of counterbalancing a
similar connection between Ptolemy and Lysimachus; Lysimachus
and his son Agathocles having united themselves with two
daughters of Ptolemy.

Long peace
in Asia,
301&mdash;283.

6. The eighteen years of tranquillity enjoyed
by Asia after the battle of Ipsus, prove that Seleucus
was one of the few followers of Alexander
who had any genius for the arts of peace. He
either founded or embellished a vast number of
cities, the most important of which were the
capital, Antiochia in Syria, and the two Seleucias,
one on the Tigris, the other on the Orontes: the[Pg 235]
flourishing prosperity of several of these places
was the result of the restoration of eastern trade;
new channels for which appear to have been
opened at this period on the main streams of Asia,
and more particularly on the Oxus.

The empire
divided into
satrapies.

7. The home department of his empire was
organized into satrapies, of which there were
seventy-two. But Alexander's maxim, "to give
the satrapies to natives," was wholly forgotten by
his followers; and the Seleucid&aelig; were not long
before they experienced the evil consequences of
swerving from that practice. Under such a prince
as Seleucus scarce any kingdom could of itself
fall to pieces; but the king himself paved the way
for the dismemberment of his empire, by ceding
293.
Upper Asia, together with his consort Stratonice,
to his son Antiochus; not, however, without the
previous approbation of the army.

Conquest of Asia Minor.
282.
281.

8. War with Lysimachus, kindled by ancient
jealousy, and now fomented by family feuds. The
battle of Curopedion cost Lysimachus his throne
and his life; and Asia Minor became a part of the
Syrian realm. But as Seleucus was crossing over
to Europe, to add Macedonia to his dominions, he
fell by the hand of an assassin, Ptolemy Ceraunus,
and with him the splendour of his kingdom was
extinguished.

Antiochus
Soter,
281&mdash;262.

9. The reign of his son, Antiochus I. surnamed
Soter, seemed not unprosperous, inasmuch as the
empire preserved its former extension; but in
any state founded upon conquest, the failure of
new attempts at an increase of territory is a sure
token of approaching ruin; and this was the case
here.&mdash;In such a state, the more immediately all[Pg 236]
depends on the person of the ruler, the more
rapid and sensible are the effects of degeneration
in a family like that of the Seleucid&aelig;.

The late conquests of his father in Asia Minor entangled Antiochus
in new wars; although, by the marriage of his stepdaughter
Phila with Antigonus Gonatas, he ceded his claims on
Macedonia, 277.&mdash;Fruitless attempt at subjecting Bithynia,
279; the king of that country, Nicomedes, calls in the Gauls,
who had invaded Macedonia, and gives them a settlement in Galatia,
277, where they keep their footing, even after the victory
won over them by Antiochus, 275, and by their participation in
the wars, as mercenaries, become of importance.&mdash;The newly
risen state of Pergamus likewise thrives, at the expense of the
Syrian empire, in spite of Antiochus's attack, 263; and the inroad
into Egypt, for the purpose of supporting the rebel Magas,
is anticipated by Ptolemy II. 264.

Antiochus Theus,
262&mdash;247.
Rise of the Parthian and Bactrian kingdoms.

10. Antiochus II. surnamed &#920;&#949;&#972;&#962;. During his
reign the sway was in the hands of women; and
the diseased state of the interior of the empire
became palpable by the secession of various eastern
provinces, out of which arose the Parthian
and Bactrian kingdoms. The boundless luxury
of the court hurried on the decline of the ruling
family; having once begun to sink, it could not
without difficulty have retrieved its virtue independently
of the matrimonial connections now
constantly formed from within itself.

Ascendancy of his stepsister and wife Laodice, and of his sister
Apame, relict of Magas; the latter involves him in war with
Ptolemy II. to vindicate her claims upon Cyrene; it ends by
Antiochus's marriage with Berenice, daughter of Ptolemy, and
his repudiation of Laodice, 260&mdash;252. Having, after the death
of Ptolemy, 247, put away Berenice and taken back Laodice; the
latter, distrusting his motives, cuts him off by poison.&mdash;The secession
of Parthia happened in consequence of the expulsion of
the Macedonian governor by Arsaces, founder of the house of the[Pg 237]
Arsacid&aelig;: that of Bactria, on the other hand, was brought about
by the Macedonian governor himself, Theodotus, who asserted
his independence. (Concerning these two kingdoms, see below,
book iv. period iii. Dist. Kingdoms iv. parag. 4, 5.) At first, the
former of these kingdoms comprised but a part of Parthia; the
latter only Bactria, and, perhaps, Sogdiana; both, however, were
soon enlarged at the expense of the Seleucid&aelig;.

Seleucus
Callinicus,
247&mdash;227.

11. Seleucus II. surnamed Callinicus. His
reign, twenty years in duration, is one unbroken
series of wars; in which the kingdom, already
enfeebled, was subverted, partly by the struggle
with Egypt, caused by the hatred between Laodice
and Berenice; partly by the jealousy of his
brother Antiochus Hierax; and partly by vain
attempts at recovering the upper provinces.

Assassination of Berenice, and most unfortunate war thereby
kindled with Ptolemy Evergetes of Egypt, 247&mdash;244. The assistance
which Seleucus obtains from his junior brother, Antiochus,
governor of Asia Minor, induces Ptolemy to a truce, 243;
but another war ensues between the two brothers, in which Antiochus,
at first conqueror, is himself soon afterwards conquered
in his turn, 243&mdash;240; and during this contest, Eumenes of
Pergamus greatly increases his territory at the expense of Syria,
242.&mdash;His first campaign against Arsaces, who had formed an
alliance with the Bactrian king, ended in a defeat, 238, regarded
by the Parthians as the real epoch of the foundation of their
kingdom. In the second campaign, 236, he himself fell into the
hands of the Parthians, and remained a prisoner till the day of his
death, 227.

Seleucus
Ceraunus,
227.
224.

12.  His elder son Seleucus III. surnamed Ceraunus,
on the point of taking the field against
Attalus king of Pergamus, was removed by poison.
But the dominion of the Seleucid&aelig; was
reestablished in Asia Minor by his mother's fraternal
nephew, Ach&aelig;us; and the crown ensured
to the younger brother Antiochus, governor of
Babylon.[Pg 238]

Antiochus
the Great,
224&mdash;187.

13. The long reign of Antiochus III. surnamed
the Great, is not only the most eventful in Syrian
history, but likewise marks an epoch, by the
relations now commencing between Syria and
Rome.&mdash;To earn the title of great was a task of
no extreme difficulty in such a line of princes.

Insurrection
in Media
and
Persia.
218.
220.

14. Great power of Hermias the Carian, who
soon became so formidable to the young monarch,
that he was obliged to rid himself of him by murder.
The great stand made by the brothers,
Molo and Alexander, satraps of Media and Persia,
who probably had an understanding with
Hermias, threatened the king with the loss of all
the upper provinces: it ended in the defeat of
Molo, Hermias being at last no longer able to
hinder the king from marching against him in
person.

War with
the Ptolemies:
insurrection
of Asia
Minor, 220.

219.

217.

216.

15. The intrigues of Hermias excited Ach&aelig;us
to rebellion in Asia Minor: but Antiochus held
more important, first to execute the plan he
had previously traced, of ejecting the Ptolemies
from their possessions in Syria; great as the success
which at first attended this expedition, it
was completely traversed by the battle of Raphia.&mdash;Combining
with Attalus of Pergamus, Antiochus
then defeated Ach&aelig;us, who, being shut up
in the citadel of Sardes, was treacherously delivered
into his hands.

Campaign
in the upper
provinces,
214&mdash;205.

210.

206.

16. Great campaign of Antiochus in the upper
provinces, in consequence of the seizure of Media
by Arsaces III.&mdash;Hostilities ended in a compact,
by which Antiochus agreed formerly to cede Parthia
and Hyrcania; Arsaces, on his side, pledging
himself to furnish assistance against Bactria.[Pg 239]&mdash;But
the war with Bactria was also followed by a
peace, leaving the king, Euthydemus, in possession
of his crown and dominions.&mdash;The expedition
now undertaken by Antiochus, in company with
Demetrius of Bactriana, against India, extended,
probably far up the country, and was attended
with important consequences to Bactriana. (See
below, history of Bactria, book iv. per. iii. Dist.
Kingdoms iv. parag. 5.)

The result of these great expeditions was the
establishment of the supremacy of the Seleucid&aelig;
in Upper Asia; those countries excepted which
had been formally resigned.

On his return through Arachotus and Carmania, where he wintered,
he likewise undertook a naval expedition on the Persian
gulf: here Gerrha, in possession of its freedom, appears a flourishing
place of trade.

War with Egypt,203.

17.  Resumption of the plan against Egypt,
after the death of Ptolemy Philopator; and alliance
with Philip of Macedonia, then carrying on
war in Asia. Antiochus, it is true, attained his
end in the expulsion of the Ptolemies from their
possessions in Syria, C&#339;le-Syria, and Ph&#339;nicia;
but then, his success brought him in contact with
203&mdash;198.
Rome, an event of decisive importance to himself
and his successors.

War with Rome.
197.
195.

18.  Growth of the disputes between the king
and Rome, proceeding from the conquest of the
major part of Asia Minor and the Thracian Chersonesus;
meanwhile Hannibal had taken refuge
at the Syrian court, and the probability daily increased
of a great league being formed against
Rome, although that power, after conquering Carthage,
201, and Macedonia, 197, had succeeded
[Pg 240]in winning over Greece even, by the magic spell
of freedom. But Antiochus ruined all: instead of
following Hannibal's advice, and attacking the
Romans on their own ground, he stood on the defensive,
and suffered himself to be invaded by
them in Asia. His defeat at Magnesia near
Mount Sipylus compelled him to accede to such
190.
conditions as Rome chose to dictate, and the
power of the Syrian empire was for ever broken.

For the history of this war, see below in the Roman history.
Book v. per. ii. parag. 10, 11.

Conditions
of peace
with Rome.

19. The conditions of the peace were: 1st.
That Antiochus should evacuate Asia Minor;
(Asia cis Taurum.) 2nd. That he should pay
down 15,000 talents; and to Eumenes of Pergamus
four hundred. 3rd. That Hannibal and some
others should be delivered up, and the king's
younger son Antiochus, be given as an hostage.&mdash;The
loss of the surrendered countries was a consequence
of this peace, less disadvantageous to
the Syrian kings, than the use made of it by the
conquerors. By adding the greatest part of the
ceded territories to those of the kings of Pergamus,
the Romans raised up alongside of their enemy a
rival, whom they might at their own will use as a
political engine against him.&mdash;Rome took care
likewise that the stipulated sum should be paid
by instalments in twelve years, to the end that
Syria might be kept in a permanent state of dependence.

Seleucus
Philopator,
187&mdash;176.

20. Murder of the king, 187. The reign of his
elder son, Seleucus IV. surnamed Philopator, was
a period of tranquillity; peace arising from weakness.&mdash;Though
once he unsheathed his sword in[Pg 241]
defence of Pharnaces king of Pontus, against Eumenes,
his fear of Rome soon compelled him to
restore it to the scabbard. He exchanged his son
for his brother at Rome; but fell a victim to the
ambition of his minister Heliodorus.

Antiochus
Epiphanes,
176&mdash;164.

21. Antiochus IV. surnamed Epiphanes. Educated
at Rome, he sought to combine the popular
manners of a Roman with the ostentatious luxury
of a Syrian; and thereby became an object of
universal hatred and contempt. Our information
respecting his history is too meagre to allow of our
deciding whether most of the evil reported of him,
in the Jewish accounts especially, may not be
exaggerated. At any rate, among all his faults,
we may still discern in him the germs of good
qualities.

His war
against
Egypt,
172&mdash;168:

22. War with Egypt, springing out of Ptolemy
Philometor's claims upon C&#339;le-Syria and Palestine.
Obscure as many parts are in the history
of this war yet it is evident that success attended
the arms of Antiochus, and that he would have
become master of Egypt had not Rome interfered.

The pretext for war, on the Egyptian side, was, that those
provinces had by Antiochus III. been promised as a dowry to
Cleopatra, sister of Antiochus and the mother of Philometor:
Antiochus Epiphanes, on his side, laid claim to the regency of
Egypt, as uncle to the young king, who, however, was soon declared
of age.&mdash;Opening of the war, and victory won by Antiochus
at Pelusium, 171; in consequence of which Cyprus is betrayed
into his hands.&mdash;Pelusium is fortified with a view of insuring
the possession of C&#339;le-Syria, and of facilitating an irruption
into Egypt.&mdash;Another victory, 170, and Egypt subdued as
far as Alexandria. Philometor driven by a sedition out of Alexandria,
where his brother Physcon is seated on the throne, falls
into the hands of Antiochus, who concludes with him a most ad[Pg 242]vantageous
peace, and takes his part against Physcon. Hence
siege is laid to Alexandria, 169; attended with no success.
Upon the retreat of Antiochus, Philometor, concluding a separate
peace with his brother, according to which both are to rule in
conjunction, is admitted into Alexandria. Antiochus, bitterly
enraged, now declares war against both brothers, who crave assistance
from Rome: he once more penetrates into Egypt, 168;
where the Roman ambassador, Popillius, assumes so lofty a tone,
that the Syrian king is glad to purchase peace by the surrender
of Cyprus and Pelusium.

his intolerance:

23. The religious intolerance of Epiphanes,
exhibited in his wish to introduce the Grecian
worship everywhere among the subjects of his
empire, is the more remarkable, as such instances
were less frequent in those times. This intolerance
seems to have taken its rise, not only in the
love of pomp, but in the cupidity of the king, who
by that means was enabled to appropriate to himself
the treasures of the temples, no longer inviolate,
since the defeat of his father by Rome. The
167.
consequent sedition of the Jews, under the Maccabees,
laid the foundation of the future independence
of that people, and contributed not a
little to weaken the Syrian kingdom.

See below; History of the Jews, book iv. per. iv; Small
states Jews, parag. 6. The deep decay of the finances of the
Seleucid&aelig;, palpable from the latter days of Antiochus the Great,
may be accounted for well enough, by the falling off of the revenue,
accompanied with increased luxury in the kings, (an instance
of which is furnished in the festivals celebrated by Antiochus
Epiphanes at Daphne, 166,) and in the vast presents constantly
sent to Rome, in addition to the tribute, for the purpose
of keeping up a party there.

his death,
165.

24. His expedition also into Upper Asia, Persis
especially, where great disorders were likewise
excited by the introduction of the Grecian reli[Pg 243]gion,
had for its object not only the recovery of
Armenia, but the rifling of the temples. He died,
however, on his way to Babylon.

Antiochus Eupator.

164&mdash;161.

25.  The real heir to the throne, Demetrius,
being detained at Rome as an hostage, Epiphanes
was first succeeded by his son Antiochus V. surnamed
Eupator, a child nine years old. During
his short reign, the quarrels of his guardians, the
despotism of the Romans, the protracted war with
the Jews, and the commencing conquests of the
Parthians, reduced the kingdom of the Seleucid&aelig;
to a powerless state.

Contest between Lysias, regent in the absence of Epiphanes,
and Philip, appointed by the king, previously to his death, as
guardian of the young prince, terminated by the defeat of Philip,
162.&mdash;Eupator's right acknowledged at Rome, in order that the
guardianship might fall into the hands of the senate, who administer
the government by means of a commission sent over into
Syria, and completely deprive the king of all power of resistance.
Octavius, head of the commission, put to death, probably at the
instigation of Lysias.&mdash;While the Parthian king, Mithridates I.
is prosecuting his conquests at the expense of the Syrian kingdom
in Upper Asia, Demetrius secretly escapes out of Rome,
takes possession of the throne, and causes Eupator and Lysias to
be put to death, 161.

Demetrius
Soter,
161&mdash;150.

26. Demetrius I. surnamed Soter.  He succeeded
in getting himself acknowledged at Rome,
on which all now depended. The attempts to
extend his power, by supporting Orofernes, the
pretender to the crown of Cappadocia, against
the king Ariarathes, had their origin partly in
family relations, but still more, as was the case
with almost all political transactions of those
times, in bribery. By this act he only drew upon
himself the enmity of the kings of Egypt and
Pergamus; as, moreover, he was hated by his sub[Pg 244]jects
on account of his intemperance, the chances
of success were greatly in favour of the shameful
154.
usurpation of Alexander Balas, brought about
by Heraclidas the expelled governor of Babylon,
and backed by the yet more shameful conduct of
the Roman senate, who acknowledged his title to
the throne. The Syrian kingdom was now fallen
so low, that both king and usurper were obliged
to court the favour of the Jews under Jonathan,
hitherto regarded as rebels. In the second battle
Demetrius lost his life.

Alexander
Balas,
150&mdash;145.

27. The usurper Alexander Balas endeavoured
to confirm his power by a marriage with Cleopatra,
daughter of Ptolemy Philometor: but he
soon evinced himself more unworthy even than
his predecessor of wielding the sceptre. While
he abandoned the government to his favourite,
the detested Ammonius, the eldest remaining son
of Demetrius succeeds not only in raising a party
against the usurper, but even in prevailing on
Philometor to side with himself, and give him in
marriage Cleopatra, whom he takes away from
Balas. The consequence of this alliance with
145.
Egypt was the defeat and downfal of Balas, although
it cost Philometor his life.

The account, that Philometor wished to conquer Syria for
himself, must probably be understood as meaning that he had
formed the design of recovering the ancient Egyptian possessions,
C&#339;le-Syria and Ph&#339;nicia. Otherwise, why should he
have given his daughter to a second pretender to the throne?

Demetrius Nicator, 145&mdash;126.

145.

144.

143.

142.

140&mdash;130.

28. Demetrius II. surnamed Nicator, 145&mdash;141,
and for the second time, 130&mdash;126. The disbanding
of his father's mercenaries having roused
the indignation of the army, the cruelty of his
[Pg 245]favourite Lasthenes kindled a sedition in the capital,
which could not be quenched without the
assistance of the Jews, under their high priest and
military chieftain, Jonathan.&mdash;While affairs were
in this posture, Diodotus, subsequently called
Tryphon, a dependent of Balas, excited an insurrection,
by bringing forward Antiochus, the latter's
son, and even, with the help of Jonathan,
seating him on the throne of Antioch: soon after,
Tryphon, having by treachery got Jonathan into
his power, removed Antiochus by murder, and
assumed the diadem himself.&mdash;Notwithstanding
Demetrius kept his footing only in a part of Syria,
he was enabled to obey the call of the Grecian
colonists in Upper Asia, and support them against
the Parthians, who had overrun the country as
far as the Euphrates.&mdash;Although victorious in the
commencement of the contest, he was soon after
taken by the Parthians, and remained ten years
a prisoner, though treated meanwhile as a king.

Antiochus of Sida.
139.
132.
131.


29. In order to maintain herself against Tryphon,
Cleopatra marries the younger, and better
brother, Antiochus of Sida, (Sidetes); he being
at first in alliance with the Jews,&mdash;who, however,
were soon after subdued&mdash;defeats and overthrows
Tryphon. Being now lord and master of Syria,
he undertakes a campaign against the Parthians;
at the commencement, befriended by the subjects
of the Parthians, he is successful, but soon afterwards
is attacked in winter quarters by those
very friends, and cut to pieces, together with all
his army.

If the accounts of the wanton licentiousness of his army are
not exaggerations, they furnish the clearest proof of the military[Pg 246]
despotism of those times. By continued pillage and extortion,
the wealth of the country had been collected in the hands of the
soldiers; and the condition of Syria must have been pretty nearly
the same as that of Egypt under the Mamluk sultans.

Demetrius Nicator restored,
130&mdash;126.
126.

30. Meanwhile Demetrius II. having escaped
from prison, again seated himself on the throne.
But being now still more overbearing than before,
and meddling in the Egyptian affairs, Ptolemy
Physcon set up against him a rival in the
person of Alexander Zebinas a pretended son of
Alexander Balas; by him he was defeated and
slain.

The Parthian king Phraates II. had, at first, liberated Demetrius,
to whom his sister Rhodogune was united by marriage, in
order that, by appearing in Syria, he might oblige Antiochus to
retreat. Antiochus having fallen, Phraates would fain have recaptured
Demetrius, but he escaped.

126&mdash;85.

31. The ensuing history of the Seleucid&aelig; is a
picture of civil wars, family feuds, and deeds of
horror, such as are scarcely to be paralleled. The
utmost verge of the empire was now the Euphrates;
all Upper Asia acknowledging the dominion
of the Parthians. The Jews, moreover,
having completely vindicated their independence,
the kingdom was consequently confined to Syria
and Ph&#339;nicia. So thoroughly decayed was the
state, that even the Romans&mdash;whether because
there was no longer anything to plunder, or because
they conceived it more prudent to suffer
the Seleucid&aelig; to wear themselves out in mutual
quarrels&mdash;do not seem to have taken any account
Syria becomes a Roman province, 64.
of it, until, at the conclusion of the last war with
Mithridates, they thought proper formally to annex
it to their empire as a province.

[Pg 247]

War between Alexander Zebinas and the ambitious relict of
Demetrius, Cleopatra, who with her own hand murders her eldest
son Seleucus, B. C. 125, for pretending to the crown, which she
now gives to her younger son, Antiochus Gryphus; the new
king, however, soon saw himself compelled to secure his own life
by the murder of his mother, 122; Alexander Zebinas having
been the year before, 123, defeated and put to death. After a
peaceful rule of eight years, 122&mdash;114, Antiochus Gryphus is involved
in war with his half-brother Antiochus Cyzicenus, son of
Cleopatra by Antiochus Sidetes: it ends, 111, in a partition of
territory. But the war between the brothers soon burst out
anew, and just as this hapless kingdom seemed about to crumble
into pieces, Gryphus was murdered, 97.&mdash;Seleucus, the eldest of
his five sons, having beaten and slain Cyzicenus, 96; the eldest
son of the latter, Antiochus Eusebes, prosecuted the war against
the sons of Gryphus; Eusebes being at last defeated, 90, the
surviving sons of Gryphus fell to war among themselves, and the
struggle continued until the Syrians, weary of bloodshed, did
what they ought to have done long before, viz. made over the
sovereign power to Tigranes the king of Armenia, 85. Yet
Eusebes's widow, Selene, retained Ptolemais till 70; and her elder
son Antiochus Asiaticus, at the time that Tigranes was beaten
by Lucullus, in the Mithridatic war, took possession of some
provinces in Syria, 68; these were wrested from him after the
total defeat of Mithridates by Pompey, when Tigranes was
obliged to give up his claim, and Syria became a province of the
Roman empire, 64. Antiochus Asiaticus died 58; his brother
Seleucus Cybiosactes, having married Berenice, was raised to
the Egyptian throne, but murdered at her command, 57; and
thus the family of the Seleucid&aelig; was completely swept away.


II. History of the Egyptian kingdom under the Ptolemies,
323&mdash;30.

The sources of this history are for the most part the same as
in the foregoing section; see above, p. 232; but unfortunately
still more scanty; for in the first place, less information can here
be derived from the Jewish writers; secondly, as on the coins
struck under the Ptolemies no continuous series of time is
marked, but only the year of the king's reign, they are by no
means such safeguards to the chronology as those of the Seleu[Pg 248]cid&aelig;.
With respect to some few events, important illustrations
are supplied by inscriptions.

By modern writers, the history of the Ptolemies has been
composed under a form almost entirely chronological, and by no
means treated of in the spirit which it deserves.

Flourishing
state of
Egypt
under the
Ptolemies.

1. Egypt, under the Ptolemies, fulfilled, and
perhaps more than fulfilled, the designs projected
by Alexander; it became not only a mighty
kingdom, but likewise the centre of trade, and of
science. The history of Egypt, however, confines
itself, almost solely, to that of the new capital,
Alexandria; the foundation of that city produced,
imperceptibly, a change in the national character,
which never could have been wrought by main
force. In the enjoyment of civil welfare and religious
freedom, the nation sunk into a state of
political drowsiness, such as could scarce have
been expected in a people who so often rose up
against the Persians.

Alexandria, originally, was no doubt a military colony; it was
not long, however, before it became a general place of resort for
all nations, such as was scarcely to be met with in any other town
of that day. The inhabitants were divided into three classes;[Pg 249]
Alexandrines, (that is to say, foreigners of all nations, who had
settled in the place; next to the Greeks, the Jews were, it appears,
the most numerous,) Egyptians, and Mercenaries in the
king's service. The Greeks and Macedonians divided into wards
(&#966;&#965;&#955;&#945;&#962;), constituted the citizens; they were under municipal
government; the others, such as the Jews, formed bodies corporate
according to their respective nations. The more important,
in so many respects, that Alexandria is for history, the more it
is to be regretted that the accounts respecting it, which have
reached us, are so far from satisfactory!&mdash;Concerning the topography
of ancient Alexandria:

Vermischte Schriften, vol. i.

Ptolemy
Soter,
B. C. 323&mdash;284.

321.

307.

2. Ptolemy I. surnamed Soter, the son of
Lagus, received Egypt for his share, at the first
division after the death of Alexander. Aware of
the value of his lot, he was the only one of
Alexander's successors that had the moderation
not to aim at grasping all. No doubt he was, by
the ambition of the other princes, entangled in
their quarrels, but his conduct was so cautious,
that Egypt itself was never endangered. Twice
attacked in that country, first by Perdiccas, afterwards
by Antigonus and Demetrius, he availed
himself successfully of his advantageous position,
and moreover, in this period, added to his dominion
several countries without Africa, such as
Ph&#339;nicia, Jud&aelig;a, C&#339;le-Syria, and Cyprus.

The possession of Ph&#339;nicia and C&#339;le-Syria, by reason of their
forests, was of indispensable necessity to Egypt as a naval power.
They frequently changed masters. The first occupation of those
provinces by the Egyptian government, occurred in 320, soon
after the rout of Perdiccas by Ptolemy's general Nicanor, who
took the Syrian satrap Laomedon prisoner, established his footing
in the whole of Syria, and placed garrisons in the Ph&#339;nician[Pg 250]
cities. In 314 it was again lost to Antigonus, after his return
out of Upper Asia, and the siege of Tyre. Ptolemy having
defeated Demetrius at Gaza, 312, repossessed himself of those
countries, but soon after evacuated them on the appearance of
Antigonus, to whom they were ceded by the peace of 311. At
the conclusion of the last grand league against Antigonus, 303,
Ptolemy once more occupied them: but alarmed at a false report,
that Antigonus had gained a victory, he retreated into Egypt,
leaving nevertheless troops in the cities. After the battle of
Ipsus, 301, those countries were made over to him, and continued
in the hands of the Ptolemies until they were lost at the
second invasion of Antiochus the Great, 203.

Cyprus, (see p. 154) like most other islands, acknowledged
submission to those who possessed the sovereignty of the sea, and
therefore could not escape the dominion of the Ptolemies. It
was taken possession of by Ptolemy as early as 313. Still the
separate cities of the islands preserved their kings, among whom
Nicocles of Paphos, having entered into a secret league with
Antigonus, was put to death, 310. After the great seafight,
307, Cyprus fell into the hands of Antigonus and Demetrius.
Subsequently to the battle of Ipsus, 301, it remained indeed at
first in the power of Demetrius; but that prince being gone over
to Macedonia, Ptolemy, 294, seized an opportunity of recovering
it, and the island from that time remained under the dominion
of Egypt. Availing themselves of their naval strength, the
Egyptian kings frequently exerted sovereign power over the
coasts of Asia Minor, especially Cilicia, Caria, and Pamphylia,
which appear to have absolutely formed a part of their territory
under the second Ptolemy. It is, however, hardly possible to
define with accuracy what were their real possessions in those
quarters.

Cyrene and
Libya annexed
to
Egypt.

3. Ptolemy likewise extends his territory within
Africa, by the capture of Cyrene; in consequence
of which Libya, or the neighbouring
countries betwixt Cyrene and Egypt, fell under
his dominion. It is probable, also, that even in
his reign the frontier of the Egyptian empire was
advanced into &AElig;thiopia; but for this assertion we
have no positive authority.[Pg 251]

The fall of Cyrene was brought about by domestic broils: at
the time the place was besieged by Thimbron, a portion of the
exiled nobles fled to Ptolemy; the Egyptian prince commanded
that they should be reinstated by his general Ophellas, who took
possession of the town itself, 321. An insurrection in 312 was
quelled by Agis, Ptolemy's general: nevertheless it would appear
that Ophellas had almost established his independence, when,
by the treachery of Agathocles, with whom he had entered into a
league against Carthage, he perished, about 308. Cyrene was
now seized by Ptolemy, and given to his son Magas, who ruled
over it fifty years.

Constitution
of the
government.

4. With respect to the internal government of
Egypt, our information is far from complete. The
division into districts or nomes was continued;
subject perhaps, in some cases, to alterations.
The power of the king appears to have been unlimited;
the extreme provinces were administered
by governors, appointed by the sovereign;
similar officers were probably placed at the head
of the various districts of Egypt itself; but hardly
any document relative to the home department of
that country has reached our time. High public
situations, at least in the capital, appear exclusively
reserved to Macedonians or Greeks; no
Egyptian is ever mentioned as holding office.

There were four magistrates at Alexandria: the Exegetes,
whose office was to provide for the wants of the city; the Chief
Judge; the Hypomnematographus&mdash;(Registrar of the archives?)&mdash;and the
&#931;&#964;&#961;&#945;&#964;&#951;&#947;&#8056;&#962; &#957;&#965;&#954;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#957;&#8056;&#962;,
no doubt, the supervisor of the
police, whose duty it was to watch over the peace of the city at
night. We have the express testimony of Strabo, that these
offices, which continued under the Romans, had already existed
under the kings; whether their establishment can be dated as
far back as the time of Ptolemy I. is a question that does not
admit of a solution.&mdash;The number of the districts or nomes appears
to have been augmented; probably with a political view,
in order that no governor or monarch should be invested with too
great a share of power.[Pg 252]

The priest-caste
and
religion remain.

5. Be that as it may, it is an undoubted fact,
that the ancient national constitution and administration
were not entirely obliterated. The
caste of priests, together with the national religion,
continued to exist; and though the influence
of the former was considerably diminished,
it did not entirely cease. A certain sort of
worship was, by appointed priests, paid to the
kings, both in their lifetime and after their death.
Memphis, though not the usual residence of the
court, remained the capital of the kingdom; there
the ceremony of coronation was performed; and
its temple of Phtha was still the head sanctuary.
What influence had not the religion of the Egyptians
upon that of the Greeks! It were difficult
to say which nation borrowed most from the
other.

Character
of the first
of the Ptolemies.

6. The regeneration of Egypt from the state of
general ruin into which she had been plunged,
and the permanent tranquillity she enjoyed during
nearly thirty years, the duration of the reign of
Ptolemy I.&mdash;at a time when the rest of the world
was harassed by continual wars,&mdash;must have
heightened her prosperity under so mild and beneficent
a ruler. But Ptolemy was certainly the
only prince who could have taken advantage of
these favourable circumstances. Though a soldier
by profession he was highly accomplished,
was himself a writer, and had a genius for all the
arts of peace, which he fostered with the open-handed
liberality of a king: while amidst all the
brilliant splendour of his court, he led himself the
life of a private individual.

Literature
encouraged.

7.  But what more than any thing else distinguished
Ptolemy from his contemporaries was his
regard for the interests of science. The idea of
founding the Museum sprung out of the necessities
of the age, and was suited to the monarchical
form of government now prevalent. Where
in those days of destruction and revolution could
the sciences have found a shelter, if not under
the protection of a prince? But under Ptolemy
they found more than a shelter, they found a rallying
point. Here accordingly the exact sciences
were perfected: and although the critic's art
which now grew up could not form a Homer or a
Sophocles, should we, had it not been for the
Alexandrines, be at present able to read either
Homer or Sophocles?

Foundation of the Museum, (Society of the learned,) and of
the first library in Bruchium, (afterwards removed to the Serapeum;)
probably under the direction of Demetrius Phalereus.
A proper estimation of the services rendered by the Museum is
yet wanting: what academy in modern Europe, however, has
done so much?

Ptolemy
Philadelphus,
284&mdash;246.

8.  Ptolemy II. surnamed Philadelphus, son of
Berenice, the second wife of his father, had
ascended the throne in 286 as joint king. His
reign, which lasted thirty-eight years, was more
peaceful even than that of his predecessor, whose[Pg 254]
spirit seemed to inspire him in every thing, save
that he was not a warrior: but, by that very
reason, the arts of peace, trade, and science were
promoted with the greater energy. In his reign
Egypt was the first power by sea, and one of the
first by land, in the world; and even though the
account given by Theocritus of its thirty-three
thousand cities may be regarded as the exaggeration
of a poet, it is very certain that Egypt
was in those days the most flourishing country in
existence.

The commerce of Alexandria was divided into three main
branches: 1. The land-trade over Asia and Africa. 2. The sea-trade
on the Mediterranean. 3. The sea-trade on the Arabian
gulf, and Indian ocean.&mdash;With regard to the land-trade of Asia,
especially that of India carried on by caravans, Alexandria was
obliged to share it with various cities and countries: since one of
its chief routes traversed the Oxus, and Caspian, to the Black
sea; while the caravans, travelling through Syria and Mesopotamia,
spread for the most part among the seaports of Ph&#339;nicia
and Asia Minor.&mdash;The trade over Africa extended far west, and
still farther south. Westward it was secured by the close connection
between Cyrene and Alexandria; and no doubt followed
the same roads as in earlier times: of far greater importance was
that carried on with the southern countries, or &AElig;thiopia, into the
interior of which they now penetrated, principally for the purpose
of procuring elephants. The navigation on the Arabian and
Indian seas had likewise for its immediate object the &AElig;thiopian
trade, rather than the Indian.&mdash;The measures taken by Ptolemy
with this view, consisted partly in the building of harbours
(Berenice, Myos Hormos) on the Arabian gulf; partly in establishing
a caravan from Berenice to Coptos on the Nile, down
which latter the goods were further transmitted to their destination;
for the canal connecting the Red sea with the Nile, although,
perhaps, completed at this time, was nevertheless but
little used. The grand deposit for these wares was the lesser
harbour of Alexandria, united by a canal with the lake Mareotis,
which in its turn communicated by another canal with the Nile;
so that the account we receive of the lesser harbour being more[Pg 255]
thronged and full of bustle than the larger one, need not excite
our surprise. With regard to the trade on the Mediterranean, it
was shared between Alexandria, Rhodes, Corinth, and Carthage.
The chief manufactories appear to have been those of cotton
stuffs, established in or near the temples.

The best inquiry into the trade of Alexandria will be found in
J. C. D. De Schmidt, Opuscula, res maxime Aegyptiorum illustrantia,
1765, 8vo.

Revenue
of Egypt.

9.  It would be important to know what, in a
state like Egypt, was the system of imposts,
which under Philadelphus produced 14,800 silver
talents, (four millions sterling,) without taking into
account the toll paid in grain. In the extreme
provinces, such as Palestine, the taxes were annually
farmed to the highest bidder, a mode of
levy attended with great oppression to the people.
The case appears to have been very different with
regard to Egypt itself; the customs, however,
constituted the main branch of the revenue.

Events of
the reign
of Philadelphus.

10.  The wars waged by Ptolemy II. were
limited to those against Antiochus II. of Syria,
and Magas of Cyrene, half-brother to the Egyptian
king; the former sprung out of the latter.
Luckily for Egypt, Ptolemy II. was of a weak
constitution, and by his state of health was incapacitated
from commanding his armies in person.&mdash;Under
his reign the first foundation was laid,
by means of reciprocal embassies, of that connection
with Rome which afterwards decided the fate
of Egypt.

Magas had, after the defeat of Ophellas, received Cyrene, 308.
He had married Apame, daughter of Antiochus I., and in 266
had raised the standard of rebellion with the intention of invading
Egypt itself, when an insurrection in Marmarica compelled him
to retreat; he contrived, notwithstanding, to prevail upon his[Pg 256]
father-in-law to undertake an expedition against Egypt, which,
however, was frustrated by Philadelphus, 264. To terminate this
contest, Magas was about to unite his daughter Berenice with
the eldest son of Philadelphus; Apame, wishing to thwart the
negotiation, fled over to her brother, Antiochus II. whom, after
her husband's death, 258, she excited to a war against Egypt,
which closed in 252.&mdash;The embassy to Rome originated in the
victory won by the Romans over Pyrrhus, 273; it was answered
by another from the Romans, 272.

Character
of Ptolemy
Philadelphus.

11. The son inherited from his father all but
the simplicity of domestic life: under the reign of
Philadelphus, the court was first thrown open to
that effeminate luxury, which soon wrought the
destruction of the Ptolemies as it had previously
done that of the Seleucid&aelig;; at the same time was
introduced the pernicious practice of intermarriages
in the same family, by which the royal
blood was more foully contaminated here even
than in Syria. Philadelphus set the first example,
by repudiating Arsinoe the daughter of Lysimachus,
and then marrying his own sister, likewise
named Arsinoe; this princess preserved her influence
over the king as long as she lived, although
she did not bring him an heir, but adopted the
children of her predecessor.

Ptolemy
Evergetes,
246&mdash;221.

12. Ptolemy III. surnamed Evergetes. Under
him, Egypt, from being merely mercantile, assumed
the character of a conquering state; notwithstanding
his warlike spirit, he was not uninspired
with that genius for the arts of peace peculiar
to his family. His conquests were directed
partly against Asia in the war with Seleucus II.
and extended as far as the borders of Bactria; and
partly, it is probable, against the interior of Ethiopia,
and the western coast of Arabia. Countries[Pg 257]
so wealthy, and with which commerce had made
men so well acquainted, could hardly escape the
arms of such a formidable power as Egypt; yet
she seems to have made scarcely any other use
of this extension of territory, than to insure the
safety of her commercial routes.

The main source of the history of Ptolemy Evergetes, is the
inscription on the monument erected by that prince at Adule
in Ethiopia: it contains a chronological list of his conquests,
a copy of which has been preserved to us by Cosmas Indicopleustes;
modern researches, however, have shown the probability
of its having consisted of two inscriptions, one referring
to Evergetes, the other to a later king of Abyssinia.&mdash;According
to this monument, Ptolemy inherited from his father, besides
Egypt itself, Libya, that is to say, western Africa as far as
Cyrene, C&#339;le-Syria, Ph&#339;nicia, Lycia, Caria, Cyprus, and the
Cyclades.&mdash;War with Seleucus Callinicus caused by the murder
of Berenice (see above, p. 237.); lasted until the ten years' truce,
246&mdash;240. During this war, he conquered the whole of Syria as
far as the Euphrates, and most of the maritime countries in Asia
Minor, from Cilicia to the Hellespont: an easy prey to a naval
power. Whether the conquest of the countries beyond the Euphrates,
Mesopotamia, Babylonia, Persis, Susiana, and Media
as far as Bactria, was effected in these four years, or not till between
240 and 230, is a question which cannot be determined
with certainty. If we may judge by the booty brought back,
this campaign was rather a foray than a regular expedition for
conquest, though Ptolemy, indeed, appointed governors in Cilicia
and Babylonia; yet the peculiar situation of affairs in Asia
at the time, Seleucus being at war with his brother Antiochus
Hierax, and the Parthian and Bactrian kingdoms being also in a
state of infant feebleness, afforded unusual opportunities for an
expedition of this sort.

The southern conquests, so far as they may be referred to
Evergetes, were effected during the last period of his reign, in a
separate war. They comprised: 1st. The greatest part of modern
Abyssinia,&mdash;for as the catalogue of nations commences with
that of Abyssinia, it necessarily follows that Nubia had already
been subjected to Egypt.&mdash;The mountain range along the Arabian
gulf, the plain of Sennaar as far as modern Darfur, the lofty[Pg 258]
chain of mountains to the south, beyond the fountains of the
Nile. All these conquests were made by the king in person;
and from those distant lands to Egypt, commercial roads were
opened. 2nd. The western coast of Arabia, from Leuke Kome
to the southern point of Arabia Felix, was conquered by his
generals and admirals: here, likewise, the security of the commercial
roads was established.

13. Egypt was singularly blessed in having
three great kings, whose reigns filled one whole
century. A change now ensued; but that change
was brought about by the natural course of
events; in fact, it could scarcely be expected that
the court should remain untainted by such luxury
as must have prevailed in a city, which was the
main seat of trade, and the deposit of the treasures
of the richest countries.

Ptolemy
Philopator,
221&mdash;234.

14. Ptolemy IV. surnamed Philopator. A debauchee
and a tyrant, who, during the greater
portion of his reign, remained under the tutelage
of the crafty Sosibius, and, after the decease of
that individual, fell into the yet more infamous
hands of Agathocles and his sister Agathoclea.
Philopator being contemporary with Antiochus
the Great, the dangers that threatened Egypt
under such a reign seemed to be doubled; they
were, however, averted by the ill-deserved victory
of Raphia (see above, p. 238).

Ptolemy
Epiphanes,
204&mdash;181.

203.

202.

15. Agathocles and his sister would fain have
taken into their own hands the guardianship of
[Pg 259]his son Ptolemy V. surnamed Epiphanes, a child
only five years old; but the people having risen
up and made a terrible example of them, the
office of guardian was confided to the younger
Sosibius and to Tlepolemus. The reckless prodigality
of the former soon gave rise to a feud between
him and his colleague, who was at least
cunning enough to keep up appearances. Meanwhile
the critical posture in which the kingdom
was placed, by the attack of the enleagued kings
of Syria and Macedonia, compelled the nation to
defer the regency to Rome and the senate, who
had hitherto carefully cherished an amicable connection
with Egypt.

The regency confided to M. Lepidus, 201, who hands over the
administration to Aristomenes of Acarnania. The sequel will
show how decidedly important this step was for the ulterior destinies
of Egypt. By the war of the Romans against Philip, and
their differences with Antiochus, Egypt was, no doubt, for the
present extricated from her embarrassment; but nevertheless in
198 she lost her Syrian possessions, notwithstanding Antiochus
III. had promised to give them as a dowry to Cleopatra, the affianced
bride, and subsequently the consort of the young king of
Egypt.

To this time, or about 197, belongs the celebrated inscription
on the Rosetta stone, erected by the caste of priests as a tribute of
gratitude for past benefits, after the consecration of the king at
Memphis upon his coming of age: a monument important alike
for pal&aelig;ography, and for the knowledge of Egyptian administration.

Character
of Epiphanes.

184.

183.

16. The hopes conceived of Epiphanes, were
grievously disappointed as he grew up to manhood.
His guardian Aristomenes fell a victim to
[Pg 260]his tyranny; nay, his cruelty drove even the patient
Egyptians to rebel, although the insurrections
were stilled by his counsellor and general
Polycrates. His reign happened during the period
in which Rome crushed the power of Macedonia
and Syria; and notwithstanding the close alliance
between Epiphanes and Antiochus III. the Romans
succeeded in holding the Egyptian king in
dependence; he was, however, in the twenty-eighth
year of his age, brought to an early grave
by intemperance and debauchery.

Ptolemy
Philometor,
181&mdash;145.

17. Of his two sons, the elder, a child five years
old, was his immediate successor; this prince, by
the title of Ptolemy VI. surnamed Philometor, ascended
the throne under the guardianship of his
mother Cleopatra, who fulfilled the duties of her
office to the satisfaction of all, until 173. But,
after her death, the regency having fallen into the
hands of Eul&aelig;us an eunuch, and Len&aelig;us, these
individuals, asserting their claims to C&#339;le-Syria
and Ph&#339;nicia, engaged with Antiochus Epiphanes
in a war exceedingly detrimental to Egypt, until
Rome commanded peace to be made.

Antiochus, after the victory of Pelusium, B. C. 171, and the
treacherous surrender of Cyprus, having possessed himself of
Egypt as far as Alexandria, a faction arose in the city; Philometor
was expelled, and his younger brother Physcon seated on
the throne, 170.&mdash;The exile Philometor fell into the power of
Antiochus, who compelled the fugitive to sign a separate peace,
highly injurious to the interests of Egypt. The articles were
not, however, ratified; Philometor secretly entering into an
agreement with his brother that they should both rule in common,
169. Antiochus having in consequence again made an inroad
into Egypt, the two kings addressed themselves for assistance
to the Ach&aelig;ans and to the Romans: the latter forthwith
despatched an embassy to Antiochus, commanding him to[Pg 261]
evacuate the territory of their allies, which happened accordingly,
168.

Disputes
between the
sons of
Epiphanes.

18.  In the contest, which soon afterwards ensued
between the two brothers, the younger was
driven out and sought a refuge at Rome; when a
partition of the kingdom between the princes was
determined upon: the senate, however, after due
consideration, refused to confirm the decision, so
that the disputes between the two kings were rekindled
and protracted, until the younger fell into
the power of the elder.

In the first division, 164, Philometor received Egypt and
Cyprus; and the infamous Physcon had for his share Cyrene
and Libya. But, during his stay at Rome, Physcon, contrary to
all justice, obtained the promise of Cyprus; Philometor refusing
to give up that portion of his share, and Cyrene having risen up
against its king, Physcon ran the risk of losing the whole of his
dominions. In the war which, supported by Rome, he waged
against his brother, Physcon fell, 159, into the hands of Philometor,
who not only forgave him, but, leaving him in possession
of Cyrene and Libya, added some cities in the place of Cyprus,
and promised him his daughter in marriage.

Philometor
interferes
in the affairs
of Syria.

19.  During the last period of his reign, Philometor
was almost exclusively busied with Syrian
affairs. He supported Alexander Balas against
Demetrius, and even gave him his daughter Cleopatra.
Nevertheless, he afterwards passed over
to the side of Demetrius, seated him on the
throne, gave him in marriage this same Cleopatra,
who had been taken away from Balas. But in
the battle in which Balas was overthrown, the
Egyptian king also received his death wound.
145.
He may be regarded as one of the good princes
of the Ptolemaic dynasty, especially if compared
with his brother.[Pg 262]

Ptolemy
Physcon,
145&mdash;117.

20. His younger brother Ptolemy VIII. surnamed
Physcon, and likewise Evergetes II. a
monster both in a moral and a physical sense,
who had hitherto been king of Cyrene, now possessed
himself of the throne of Egypt by marrying
his predecessor's widow and sister, Cleopatra,
whom, however, after having murdered her son,
he repudiated for her daughter of the same name.
This prince accordingly, once more united the divided
kingdom; but at the same time that he was
purchasing the sanction of Rome by vile adulation,
he maintained himself at Alexandria by
means of military law, which soon converted the
city into a desert, and obliged him to attract
foreign colonists by large promises. Another
130.
bloody massacre, however, produced an insurrection
in the town, which compelled the king to flee
to Cyprus, the Alexandrines, meanwhile, raising
to the throne his repudiated wife Cleopatra.
Physcon, nevertheless, with the assistance of his
mercenaries, recovered the sceptre, and wielded
it to the day of his death.

That a prince of such a character should nevertheless be a
friend to science, and himself an author, must ever be regarded
as a singular phenomenon; yet his exaction of manuscripts, and
his treatment of the learned, whole crowds of whom he expelled,
betray the despot.

Ptolemy
Lathyrus,
116&mdash;81.

116.

107.

89.

88.

21. His widow, the younger Cleopatra, to gratify
the Alexandrines, was obliged to place on the throne
the elder of her two sons, Ptolemy IX. surnamed
Lathyrus, who was living in a sort of banishment
at Cyprus: to the younger, Ptolemy Alexander
I. who was her favourite, she accordingly gave the
island of Cyprus. But Lathyrus not choosing to
[Pg 263]obey her in everything, she compelled him to exchange
Egypt for Cyprus, and gave the former to
her younger son. But neither was the new king
able to brook the tyranny of his mother: as she
threatened even his life, he saw no other means
of escape than to anticipate her design; but failing
in his project, he was obliged to take to flight,
and, after a vain attempt to recover the throne,
perished. The Alexandrines then reinstated in
the government his elder brother Lathyrus, who
ruled till the year 81, possessing both Egypt and
Cyprus.

Revolt and three years' siege of Thebes in Upper Egypt, still
one of the most wealthy cities even in those days, but after its
capture almost levelled to the earth; about 86.&mdash;Complete separation
of Cyrenaica from Egypt: this province had been bequeathed
by Physcon as a separate branch-state to his illegitimate
son, Apion, 117; that prince, after a tranquil reign, bequeathed
it, in his turn, to the Romans, 96, who at first allowed it to retain
its independence.

Obscure
period of
the history.
81&mdash;66.

22. Lathyrus left one daughter born in wedlock,
Berenice, and two illegitimate sons, Ptolemy
of Cyprus and Ptolemy Auletes.  Besides the
above, there was a lawful son of Alexander I. of
the same name as his father, and at that time residing
at Rome with the dictator Sylla. The following
history is obscured by clouds, which,
amid the contradiction of accounts, cannot be entirely
dispelled. Generally speaking, Egypt was
now a tool in the hands of powerful individuals at
Rome, who regarded it but as a financial speculation
whether they actually supported a pretender
to the Egyptian crown, or fed him with
vain hopes. All now saw that Egypt presented[Pg 264]
a ripe harvest; but they could not yet agree by
whom that harvest should be reaped.

The first successor of Lathyrus in Egypt was his legitimate
daughter Cleopatra Berenice, 81: at the end of six months, however,
Sylla, then dictator at Rome, sent his client Alexander II.
to Egypt, 80; that prince married Berenice, and with her ascended
the throne. Nineteen days after Alexander murdered his consort,
and, according to Appian, was himself about the same time cut
off by the Alexandrines, on account of his tyranny. We afterwards
hear, notwithstanding, of a king Alexander, who reigned
until 73, or, according to others, until 66; when, being driven
out of Egypt, he fled to Tyre, and called upon the Romans for
that aid, which probably through C&aelig;sar's intercession, would
have been granted, had not the supplicant soon after died at the
place of his refuge. He is said to have bequeathed by will his
kingdom to Rome; and although the senate did not accept the
legacy, it does not appear to have formally rejected the offer; in
consequence of which, frequent attempts were made at Rome for
effecting the occupation.&mdash;Either, therefore, Appian's account
must be false, and this person was the same Alexander II. or he
was some other person bearing that name, and belonging to the
royal house.&mdash;Be this as it may, after the death of Lathyrus the
kingdom was dismembered: and one of his illegitimate sons,
Ptolemy, had received Cyprus, but that island was taken from
him, 57, and converted into a Roman province: the other, Ptolemy
Auletes, seems to have kept his footing either in a part of
Egypt, or in Cyrene, and was probably the cause of Alexander's
expulsion, at whose decease he ascended the throne; although
the Syrian queen Selene, sister to Lathyrus, asserted her son's
claims at Rome, as legitimate heir to the throne of Egypt. With
C&aelig;sar's assistance, Auletes, however, succeeded in obtaining the
formal acknowledgment of his right at Rome, 59. But the measures
taken by the Romans with regard to Cyprus, gave rise to
a sedition at Alexandria, 57, in consequence of which Auletes,
being compelled to flee, passed over into Italy: or, perhaps, he
was ordered to take this step by the intrigues of some Roman
grandees, anxious of an opportunity to reinstate him. Pompey's
attempts, with this view, are thwarted by Cato, 56. Meanwhile
the Alexandrines placed Berenice, the eldest daughter of Auletes,
on the throne; she married first Seleucus Cybiosactes, as[Pg 265]
being the lawful heir; and after putting that prince to death,
united herself to Archelaus, 57.&mdash;Actual restoration of Auletes
by the purchased assistance of Gabinius, the Roman governor of
Syria; and execution of Berenice, whose husband had fallen in
the war, 54. Not long after, this miserable prince, no less
effeminate than tyrannical, died, 51.

J. R. Forster, Commentatio de successoribus Ptolem&aelig;i VII.
Inserted in Comment. Soc. Gotting. vol. iii.

Cleopatra,
51&mdash;31.

23. Auletes endeavoured by his last testament
to insure the kingdom to his posterity, nominating
as his successor, under the superintendence of the
Roman nation, his two elder children. Ptolemy
Dionysos, then thirteen years old, and Cleopatra,
seventeen, who were to be united in wedlock:
his two younger children, Ptolemy Neoteros and
Arsinoe, he recommended to the Roman senate.
Notwithstanding these measures, Egypt would
not have escaped her fate upwards of twenty
years longer, had not the impending calamities
been diverted by the internal posture of affairs
at Rome, and still more by the charms and policy
of Cleopatra, who through her alliance with C&aelig;sar
and Antony not only preserved but even aggrandized
her kingdom. From this time, however,
the history of Egypt is most closely implicated
with that of Rome.

Feuds between Cleopatra and her brother, excited and fomented
by the eunuch Pothinus, in whose hands the administration
was: they lead to open war: Cleopatra, driven out, flees to
Syria, where she levies troops: C&aelig;sar in pursuit of the conquered
Pompey arrives at Alexandria, and in the name of Rome, assumes
the part of arbitrator between the king and queen, but
suffers himself to be guided by the artifices of Cleopatra, 48.
Violent sedition in Alexandria, and C&aelig;sar besieged in Bruchium,
the malcontent Pothinus having brought Achillas, the commander
of the royal troops into the city. The hard struggle in
which C&aelig;sar was now engaged, demonstrates not only the bit[Pg 266]terness
of the long rankling grudge of the Alexandrines against
Rome, but shows also how decisive, to the whole of Egypt, were
the revolutions of the capital. Ptolemy Dionysos having fallen
in the war, and C&aelig;sar being victorious, the crown fell to Cleopatra,
47, upon condition of marrying her brother, when he
should be of age: but as soon as the prince grew to manhood,
and had been crowned at Memphis, she removed him by
poison, 44.

Egypt becomes
a
Roman
province.

24. During the life of C&aelig;sar, Cleopatra remained
under his protection, and consequently in
a state of dependence. Not only was a Roman garrison
stationed in the capital city, but the queen
herself, together with her brother, were obliged to
visit him at Rome. After the assassination of
C&aelig;sar, she took the side of the triumviri, not
without endangering Egypt, threatened by Cassius
who commanded in Syria; and after the
death of her brother, succeeded in getting them
to acknowledge as king, Ptolemy C&aelig;sarion, a
son whom she pretended to have had by C&aelig;sar.&mdash;But
the ardent passion conceived by Antony
for her person, soon after the discomfiture of the
republican party, now attached her inseparably
to his fortunes; which, after vainly attempting
to win over the victorious Octavius, she at last
shared.

The chronology of the ten years in which Cleopatra lived, for
the most part, with Antony, is not without difficulty, but, according
to the most probable authorities, may be arranged in the
following manner. Summoned before his tribunal, on account of
the pretended support afforded by some of her generals to Cassius,
she appears in his presence at Tarsus, in the attire, and
with the parade, of Venus, 41; he follows her into Egypt. In
the year 40, Antony, called back to Italy by the breaking out of
the Perusine war, is there induced, by political motives, to
espouse Octavia; meanwhile Cleopatra abides in Egypt. In the
autumn of 37, she goes to meet him in Syria, where he was[Pg 267]
making ready for the war against the Parthians, until then prosecuted
by his lieutenants; here she obtained at his hands Ph&#339;nicia&mdash;Tyre
and Sidon excepted,&mdash;together with Cyrene and
Cyprus; and in 36 went back to Alexandria, where she remained
during the campaign. The expedition ended, Antony
returned into Egypt and resided at Alexandria. From thence
it was his intention to attack Armenia in 35; this design, however,
he did not effect until 34, when, after taking the king prisoner,
he returned in triumph to Alexandria, and presented to
Cleopatra, or to his three children by her, all the countries of
Asia from the Mediterranean to the Indus, already conquered
or to be conquered. Preparing then to renew, in conjunction
with the king of Media, his attack on the Parthians, he is prevailed
upon by Cleopatra to break with Octavia, who was to
bring over troops to him, 38. A war between him and Octavius
being now unavoidable, the Parthian campaign already opened
is suspended, and Cleopatra accompanies Antony to Samos, 32,
where he formally repudiated Octavia. From hence she followed
him in his expedition against Octavius, which was decided
by the battle of Actium, fought September 2, 31.&mdash;Octavius
having pursued his enemy into Egypt, Alexandria was besieged,
30, and after Antony had laid violent hands on himself,
the place surrendered; and Cleopatra, not brooking to be dragged
a prisoner to Rome, followed the example of her lover, and procured
her own death.

Flourishing
state of
Egypt.

25. Even in this last period, Egypt appears to
have been the seat of unbounded wealth and effeminacy.
The line of infamous princes who had
succeeded to the third Ptolemy were unable to
destroy her prosperity. Strange, however, as this
seems, it may be easily accounted for when we
consider that the political revolutions scarcely
ever overstepped the walls of the capital, and that
an almost perpetual peace ruled in the country:
that Egypt was the only great theatre of trade;
and that that trade must have increased in the
same proportion as the spirit of luxury increased
in Rome, and in the Roman empire. The power[Pg 268]ful
effects wrought on Egypt by the growth of
Roman luxury, are most convincingly demonstrated
by the state of that country when it had
become a Roman province; so far from the trade
of Alexandria decreasing in that period,&mdash;though
the city suffered in the first days after the conquest&mdash;it
subsequently attained an extraordinary
and gigantic bulk.


III. History of Macedonia and of Greece in general, from
the death of Alexander to the Roman conquest, B. C.
323&mdash;146.

The sources for this history are the same as have been quoted
above: see p. 232. Until the battle of Ipsus, 301, Diodorus is
still our grand authority. But in the period extending from 301
to 224, we meet with some chasms: here almost our only sources
are the fragments of Diodorus, a few of Plutarch's lives, and the
inaccurate accounts of Justin. From the year 224, our main
historian is Polybius; and even in those parts where we do not
possess his work in its complete form, the fragments that have
been preserved must always be the first authorities consulted.
Livy, and other writers on Roman history, should accompany
Polybius.

Among modern books, besides the general works mentioned
above p. 1. we may here in particular quote:

John Gast, D. D. The History of Greece, from the accession
of Alexander of Macedon, till the final subjection to the
Roman power, in eight books. London, 1782, 4to. Although
not a master-piece of composition, yet too important to be passed
over in silence.

Extent of
Macedonia.

1. Of the three main kingdoms that arose out
of Alexander's monarchy, Macedonia was the most
insignificant, not only in extent,&mdash;particularly as
till B. C. 286 Thrace remained a separate and
independent province,&mdash;but likewise in population
and wealth. Yet, being, as it were, the
head country of the monarchy, it was considered[Pg 269]
to hold the first rank; and here at first resided
the power which, nominally at least, extended
over the whole. As early, however, as the year
311, upon the total extermination of Alexander's
family, it became a completely separate kingdom.
From that time its sphere of external operation
was for the most part confined to Greece, the history
of which, consequently, is closely interwoven
with that of Macedonia.

Posture of affairs in Greece at Alexander's decease: Thebes
in ruins: Corinth occupied by a Macedonian garrison: Sparta
humiliated by the defeat she had suffered at the hands of Antipater
in her attempt at a revolt against Macedonia, under Agis
II. 333&mdash;331: Athens on the other hand flourishing, and although
confined to her own boundaries, still by her fame, and
her naval power, the first state in Greece.

Antipater.
Lamian war,
B. C. 323.

2. Although at the first division of the provinces,
Craterus, as civil governor, was united
with Antipater, the latter had the management of
affairs. And the termination, as arduous as it
was successful, of the Lamian war,&mdash;kindled immediately
after the death of Alexander, by the
Greeks, enthusiastic in the cause of freedom,&mdash;enabled
him to rivet the chains of Greece more
firmly than they had ever been before.

The Lamian war&mdash;the sparks of which had been kindled by
Alexander's edict, granting leave to all the Grecian emigrants,
twenty thousand in number, nearly the whole of whom were in
the Macedonian interest, to return to their native countries,&mdash;was
fanned to a flame by the democratic party at Athens. Urged
by Demosthenes and Hyperides, almost all the states of central
and northern Greece, B&#339;otia excepted, took up arms in the cause;
and their example was quickly followed by most of those in Peloponnesus,
with the exception of Sparta, Argos, Corinth, and
the Ach&aelig;ans. Not even the Persian war produced such general
unanimity! The gallant Leosthenes headed the league.&mdash;Defeat
of Antipater, who is shut up in Lamia; Leosthenes, however,[Pg 270]
falls in the siege of that place, B. C. 323, and although Leonatus&mdash;who
with the view of ascending the throne by his marriage
with Cleopatra, had come to the assistance of the Macedonians&mdash;was
beaten and slain, 322, the Greeks were finally overwhelmed
by the reinforcements, brought to Antipater out of Asia, by
Craterus. And Antipater having fully succeeded in breaking
the league, and negotiating with each separate nation, was enabled
to dictate the terms. Most of the cities opened their gates
to Macedonian troops; besides this, Athens was obliged to purchase
peace through the mediation of Phocion and Demades, by
an alteration in her constitution,&mdash;the poorer citizens being excluded
from all share in the government, and for the most part
translated into Thrace&mdash;and by a pledge to deliver up Demosthenes
and Hyperides; whose place Phocion occupied at the
head of the state.&mdash;The &AElig;tolians, the last against whom the
Macedonian wars were directed, obtained better terms than they
had ventured to expect, Antipater and Craterus being obliged to
hurry over to Asia in order to oppose Perdiccas.

Olympias
retires to Epirus.

Antipater dies, and
names Polysperchon
his successor,
320&mdash;316.

3. That hatred which, even in the lifetime of
Alexander, had sprung up between Antipater and
Olympias, in consequence of his not permitting
the dowager queen to rule, induced her to withdraw
to Epirus; her rankling envy being still
more embittered by the influence of the young
queen Eurydice. See above, p. 224. Antipater,
dying shortly after his expedition against Perdiccas,
in which his colleague Craterus had fallen,
and he himself had been appointed regent, nominates
his friend, the aged Polysperchon, to succeed
him as regent and head guardian, to the exclusion
of his own son Cassander. Hence arose
a series of quarrels between the two, in which,
unfortunately for themselves, the royal family
were implicated and finally exterminated, Cassander
obtaining the sovereignty of Macedonia.

Cassander having secured the interest of Antigonus and Ptolemy,
makes his escape to the former, 319: he had previously en[Pg 271]deavoured
also to raise a party in Macedonia and Greece, particularly
by getting his friend Nicanor to be commander at Athens.&mdash;Measures
taken by Polysperchon to oppose him; in the first
place, he recalls Olympias out of Epirus, but the princess dares
not come without an army; in the next place, he nominates Eumenes
commander of the royal troops in Asia (see above, p. 225);
he likewise endeavours to gain the Grecian cities, by recalling
the Macedonian garrisons, and changing the governors set over
them by Antipater. These latter, however, were in most of the
cities too firmly established to suffer themselves thus to be deposed;
and even the expedition into Peloponnesus, undertaken
by Polysperchon to enforce his injunctions was attended but with
partial success.&mdash;In the same year occurs a twofold revolution in
Athens, whither Polysperchon had sent his son Alexander, nominally
for the purpose of driving out Nicanor, but virtually to
get possession of that important city. In the first place, Alexander
and Nicanor appearing to unite both for the attainment of
one and the same object, the democratic party rise up, and overthrow
the rulers, hitherto taken from Antipater's party, and
headed by Phocion, who is compelled to swallow poison: soon
after, however, Cassander occupies the city, excludes from the
administration all that possess less than ten mines, and places at
the head of affairs Demetrius Phalereus, who, from 318 to 307,
ruled with great prudence.&mdash;Not long after, Olympias returns
with an army from Epirus; the Macedonian troops of Philip
and Eurydice having passed over to her side, she wreaks her revenge
on the royal couple, and on the brother of Cassander, all of
whom she puts to death, 317. Cassander, nevertheless, having
obtained reinforcements in Peloponnesus, takes the field against
her; she is besieged in Pydna, where, disappointed in the hope
of being relieved either by Polysperchon or by &AElig;acidas of Epirus,
both of whom were forsaken by their men, she is obliged to surrender,
316. Cassander, having caused her to be condemned by
the Macedonian people, has her put to death.

Cassander.

4. Cassander being now master, and, from
302, king of Macedonia, confirmed his dominion
by a marriage with Thessalonice, half-sister to
Alexander, and at the same time endeavoured to
corroborate as far as possible his authority in
Greece. Polysperchon and his son Alexander,
[Pg 272]it is true, still made head in Peloponnesus; but
the states without the peninsula, &AElig;tolia excepted,
were all either allies of Cassander, or occupied
by Macedonian troops.
314.
After the defeat of the
league against Antigonus, in which Cassander
had borne a part, general peace was concluded,
with the proviso, that the Grecian cities should
be free, and that the young Alexander, when of
age, should be raised to the throne of Macedonia:
311.
this induced Cassander to rid himself both of the
young prince and his mother Roxana by murder:
but he thereby exposed himself to an attack from
Polysperchon, who, availing himself of the discontent
of the Macedonians, brought back Hercules,
the only remaining illegitimate son of Alexander.
Cassander diverted the storm by a new crime,
instigating Polysperchon to murder the young
Hercules, under promise of sharing the government:
Polysperchon, however, unable to possess
himself of the Peloponnesus which had been promised
him, appears to have preserved but little
influence. Cassander met likewise with formidable
opponents in the persons of Antigonus and
his son; and although delivered by the breaking
308.
out of the war with Ptolemy from the danger of
the first invasion of Greece by Demetrius, his
situation was more embarrassing at the second
irruption; from which, however, he was extricated
by the circumstance of Antigonus being obliged
307.
to recall his son, on account of the newly formed
league (see above, p. 230).

Antigonus, on his return from Upper Asia, declares loudly
against Cassander, B. C. 314; despatches his general Aristodemus
to Peloponnesus, and frames a league with Polysperchon[Pg 273]
and his son Alexander; the latter, however, Cassander succeeds
in winning over by a promise of the command in Peloponnesus.
Alexander was soon after murdered, but his wife Cratesipolis
succeeded him, and commanded with the spirit of a man. Meanwhile,
Cassander carried war against the &AElig;tolians, who sided
with Antigonus, 313; but Antigonus, 312, having sent his general
Ptolemy into Greece with a fleet and army, Cassander lost
his supremacy. In the peace of 311, the freedom of all the
Grecian cities was stipulated; but this very condition became
the pretext of various and permanent feuds; and Cassander having
murdered the young king, together with his mother, drew
upon himself the arms of Polysperchon, who wished to place
Hercules on the throne, 310; but the pretender was removed in
the manner above described, 309.&mdash;Cassander now endeavouring
to reestablish his power over Greece, Demetrius Poliorcetes was
by his father sent into that country in order to anticipate Ptolemy
of Egypt, in the enforcement of the decree for the freedom
of the Greeks, 308; the result at Athens was the restoration of
democracy, and the expulsion of Demetrius Phalereus.&mdash;From
any further attack of Demetrius, Cassander was delivered by the
war which broke out between Antigonus and Ptolemy, (see
above, p. 229.) and had the leisure, once more, to strengthen his
power in Greece, until 302, when Demetrius arrived a second
time, and, as generalissimo of liberated Greece, pressed forward
to the borders of Macedonia; Demetrius was, however, recalled
by his father into Asia, and at the battle of Ipsus, 301, lost all
his dominions in that quarter of the world. Yet although Athens
closed her harbours against him, he still maintained his possessions
in Peloponnesus, and even endeavoured to extend them;
from thence, in 297, he sallied forth, and once more took possession
of his beloved Athens, and after driving out the usurper
Lachares, forgave her ingratitude.

Cassander
dies, and
leaves the
throne to
his sons;

5. Cassander survived the establishment of his
throne by the battle of Ipsus only three years:
and bequeathed Macedonia as an inheritance to
his three sons, the eldest of whom, Philip, shortly
after followed his father to the grave.

Antipater
and Alexander.

6. The two remaining sons, Antipater and
Alexander, soon worked their own destruction.
[Pg 274]Antipater having murdered his own mother Thessalonice,
on account of the favour she showed his
brother, was obliged to flee; he applied for help
to his father-in-law Lysimachus of Thrace, where
he soon after died. Meanwhile Alexander, fancying
that he likewise stood in need of foreign assistance,
addressed himself to Pyrrhus, king of
Macedonia, and to Demetrius Poliorcetes, both of
whom obeyed the call only with the expectation
of being paid. After various snares reciprocally
laid for each other, the king of Macedonia was
murdered by Demetrius, and with him the race
295.
of Antipater became extinct.

Demetrius,
294&mdash;287.

7. The army proclaimed Demetrius king; and
in his person the house of Antigonus ascended
the throne of Macedonia, and, after many vicissitudes,
established their power. His seven years'
reign, in which one project succeeded the other,
was a constant series of wars; and as he never
could learn how to bear with good fortune, his
ambition was at last his ruin.

The kingdom of Demetrius comprised Macedonia, Thessaly,
and the greatest part of the Peloponnesus; he was also master
of Megara and Athens.&mdash;Twofold capture of Thebes, which had
been rebuilt by Cassander, 293, and 291; unsuccessful attempt
upon Thrace, 292. His war with Pyrrhus, 290, in whom men
fancied they beheld another Alexander, had already alienated
the affections of the Macedonians; but his grand project for the
recovery of Asia induced his enemies to get the start of him;
and the hatred of his subjects compelled him secretly to escape
to Peloponnesus, to his son Antigonus, 287. Athens, taking advantage
of his misfortunes, drove out the Macedonian garrison,
and, by the election of archons, reestablished her ancient constitution;
although Demetrius laid siege to the town, he allowed
himself to be pacified by Crates. Having once more attempted
to prosecute his plans against Asia, he was obliged, 286, to sur[Pg 275]render
to Seleucus his father-in-law, who, out of charity, kept
him till the day of his death, 284.

Pyrrhus of
Epirus,
287,
286.


8.  Two claimants to the vacant throne now
arose, viz. Pyrrhus of Epirus and Lysimachus of
Thrace; but although Pyrrhus was first proclaimed
king, with the cession of half the dominions,
he could not, being a foreigner, support his
power any longer than the year 286, when he was
deposed by Lysimachus.

The sovereigns of Epirus, belonging to the family of the
&AElig;acid&aelig;, were properly kings of the Molossi. See above, p. 150.
They did not become lords of all Epirus, nor consequently of any
historical importance, until the time of the Peloponnesian war.
After that period Epirus was governed by Alcetas I. about 384,
who pretended to be the sixteenth descendant from Pyrrhus, the
son of Achilles; Neoptolemus, father to Olympias, by whose
marriage with Philip, 358, the kings of Epirus became intimately
connected with Macedonia, d. 352; Arymbas, his brother, d.
342; Alexander I. son of Neoptolemus, and brother-in-law to
Alexander the Great; he was ambitious to be as great a conqueror
in the west as his kinsman was in the east, but he fell in
Lucania, 332. &AElig;acides, son of Arymbas, d. 312. Pyrrhus II.
his son, the Ajax of his time, and, we might almost say, rather an
adventurer than a king. After uninterrupted wars waged in
Macedonia, Greece, Italy, and Sicily, he fell at last at the
storming of Argos, 272. He was followed by his son Alexander
II. in the person of whose successor, Pyrrhus III. 219, the
male line became extinct. Although the daughter of this last
prince, Deidamia, succeeded to the throne, the Epirots were not
long before they established a democratic government, which endured
till such time as they were, together with Macedonia and
the rest of Greece, brought under the Roman yoke, 146.

Lysimachus.

282.

9.  In consequence of the accession of Lysimachus,
Thrace, and for a short time even Asia
Minor, were annexed to the Macedonian kingdom.
But rankling hatred and family relations soon
afterwards involved Lysimachus in a war with[Pg 276]
Seleucus Nicator, in which, at battle of Curopedion,
he lost both his throne and his life.

Execution of the gallant Agathocles, eldest son of Lysimachus,
at the instigation of his step-mother Arsinoe: his widow Lysandra
and her brother Ptolemy Ceraunus, who had already been
driven out of Egypt by his step-mother Berenice, go over, followed
by a large party, to Seleucus, whom they excite to war.

Seleucus.

10. The victorious Seleucus, already lord of
Asia, now causing himself to be proclaimed likewise
king of Macedonia, it seemed as if that
country was again about to become the head seat
of the whole monarchy. But shortly after he
had crossed over into Europe, Seleucus fell by
the murderous hand of Ptolemy Ceraunus, who,
281.
availing himself of the treasures of his victim, and
of the yet remaining troops of Lysimachus, took
possession of the throne; by another act of treachery
he avenged himself of Arsinoe, his half-sister;
but just as he conceived himself securely
established, he lost both his crown and his life
by the irruption of the Gauls into Macedonia.

The irruption of the Gauls, threatening desolation not only to
Macedonia but to the whole of Greece, took place in three successive
expeditions. The first under Cambaules, (probably 280,)
advanced no further than Thrace, the invaders not being sufficiently
numerous. The second in three bodies; against Thrace
under Ceretrius; against P&aelig;onia under Brennus and Acichorius;
against Macedonia and Illyria under Belgius, 279. By the last-mentioned
chieftain Ptolemy was defeated; he fell in the contest.
In consequence, Meleager first, and Antipater subsequently,
were appointed kings of Macedonia; but both, on account
of incapacity, being soon afterwards deposed, a Macedonian
noble, Sosthenes, assumed the command, and this time liberated
his country. But the year 278 brought with it the main storm,
which spent its fury principally on Greece: Sosthenes was defeated
and slain: and although the Greeks brought all their[Pg 277]
united forces into the field, Brennus and Acichorius burst into
Greece on two different sides, and pushed on to Delphi, the object
of their expedition; from hence, however, they were compelled
to retreat; and most of them were cut off by hunger, cold,
or the sword. Nevertheless a portion of those barbarians stood
their ground in the interior of Thrace, which, consequently, was
for the most part lost to Macedonia: another portion, consisting
of various hordes, the Tectosag&aelig;, Tolistobii, and Trocmi, crossed
over to Asia Minor, where they established themselves in the
country called after them Galatia (see above, p. 236). Although
there can be no doubt that the Tectosag&aelig; must have come from
the innermost parts of Gaul, the mode of attack demonstrates
that the main tide of invaders consisted of the neighbouring
races; and, in fact, in those days the countries from the Danube
to the Mediterranean and Adriatic were mostly occupied by
Gauls.&mdash;Greece, though she strained every nerve, and with the
exception of Peloponnesus, was united in one league, could scarcely
bring forward more than 20,000 men to stem the torrent.

Antigonus
Gonnatas.

11. Antigonus of Gonni, son to Demetrius, now
seated himself on the vacant throne of desolated
Macedon; he bought off his competitor, Antiochus
I. named Soter, by treaty and marriage.
Successfully as he opposed the new irruption of
the Gauls, he was dethroned by Pyrrhus, who,
274.
on his return from Italy, was a second time proclaimed
king of Macedonia. That prince, however,
having formed the design of conquering the
Peloponnesus, and, after an ineffectual attack on
Sparta, which was repelled with heroic gallantry,
wishing to take possession of Argos, fell at the
272.
storming of the latter place.

Extraordinary as these frequent revolutions appear, they may
be easily accounted for by the mode of warfare in those days.
Every thing depended on the armies; and these were composed
of mercenaries, ever willing to fight against him they had defended
the day before, if they fancied his rival to be a more
valiant or fortunate leader. Since the death of Alexander, the[Pg 278]
Macedonian phalanx was no longer dependent on its captains,
but they on their men. The impoverishment of the countries, in
consequence of war, was such, that the soldier's was almost the
only profitable trade; and none prosecuted that trade more ardently
than the Gauls, whose services were ever ready for any
one who chose to pay for them.

12. After the death of Pyrrhus, Antigonus
Gonnatas recovered the Macedonian throne, of
which he and his descendants kept uninterrupted
possession, yet not till after a violent contest with
Alexander, the son and successor of Pyrrhus.
But no sooner were they secure from foreign
rivals, than the Macedonian policy was again
directed against Greece, and the capture of
Corinth seemed to insure the dependence of the
whole country, when the formation of the &AElig;tolian,
and the yet more important Ach&aelig;an, league,
gave rise to relations entirely new, and of the
highest interest, even for the universal history of
the world. After so many storms, the sun of
Greece was about to set in all his splendour!

The ancient confederacy of the twelve Ach&aelig;an cities (see
above, p. 145.) had subsisted until the death of Alexander, but
was dissolved in the subsequent commotions; particularly when,
after the battle of Ipsus, 301, Demetrius and his son made Peloponnesus
the principal seat of their power. Some of these cities
were now garrisoned by those princes, while in others arose
tyrants, generally favourable to their interests. In 281, four
asserted their freedom and renewed the ancient federation;
which, five years afterwards, was gradually joined by the rest,
Antigonus being busied elsewhere, in consequence of his occupation
of the Macedonian throne. But the league did not become
formidable till the accession of foreign states. This took place,
in the first instance, with Sicyon, through the exertions of the
liberator of that town, Aratus, who now became the animating
spirit of the federation; and in 243 brought over Corinth, after
the expulsion of the Macedonian garrison, and Megara. Afterwards
[Pg 279]
the league gradually acquired strength, by the junction of
several Grecian cities, Athens among others, 229; and thereby
excited the jealousy of the rest. And as Aratus, who was more
of a statesman than a general, and possessed but little independence,
had in the very outset joined the party of Ptolemy II. the
league soon became involved in the disputes of the great powers,
and was too often but a mere tool in their hands. The main
principles on which it was founded were the following: 1. Complete
political equality of all the federate cities; in this respect
it essentially differed from all the earlier federations in Greece.
2. Unconditional preservation of the domestic government in
every one of the cities. 3. The meeting twice a year of deputies
from all the cities, at &AElig;gium, and afterwards at Corinth; for
transacting all business of common interest, particularly foreign
affairs, and also for the purpose of electing the strategus, or military
leader and head of the union, and the ten demiurgi, or supreme
magistrates.&mdash;But what more than all contributed to exalt this
league, founded on pure liberty, was the virtue of Aratus, 213,
Philop&#339;men, 183, and Lycortas, 170; men who breathed into
it the spirit of union, until, enfeebled by Roman policy, it was
overthrown.

&#8224; Breitenbauch, History of the Ach&aelig;ans and their league,
1782.

The &AElig;tolian league was formed about 284, in consequence of
the oppressions of the Macedonian kings. The &AElig;tolians had
likewise a yearly congress, pan&aelig;tolium, at Thermus; where they
chose a strategus and the apocleti, who constituted the state
council. They had, besides, their secretary,
&#947;&#961;&#945;&#956;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#949;&#973;&#962;;
and supervisors, &#7956;&#966;&#959;&#961;&#959;&#953;,
whose particular functions are, however, matter
of doubt. This federation did not increase like the Ach&aelig;an,
none but &AElig;tolians being admitted. The more unpolished this
piratical nation remained, the more frequently it was used as the
tool of foreign, and particularly of Roman, policy.

Demetrius
II.
243&mdash;233.

13. Antigonus, in the latter part of his reign,
had recourse to various means, and more especially
to an alliance with the &AElig;tolians, for the
purpose of counterpoising the Ach&aelig;ans. He died
in his eightieth year, and was succeeded by his
son, Demetrius II. who waged war upon the[Pg 280]
&AElig;tolians, now, however, supported by the Ach&aelig;ans;
and endeavoured to repress the growth of
the latter, by favouring the tyrants of particular
cities. The remainder of the reign of this prince
is little more than a chasm in history.

The vulgar assertion that this prince conquered Cyrene and
Libya, originates in a confusion of names; his uncle Demetrius,
son of Poliorcetes of Ptolemais, being mentioned by Plutarch as
king of Cyrene. The history of that town, from 258 to 142, is
enveloped in almost total darkness: cf. Prolog. Trogi, l. xxvi. ad
calcem Justini.

Antigonus
Doson,
233&mdash;221.

14. Demetrius's son Philip was passed over;
his brother's son, Antigonus II. surnamed Doson,
being raised to the throne. This king was occupied
the most of his time by the events in Greece,
where a very remarkable revolution at Sparta,
as we learn from Plutarch, had raised up a formidable
enemy against the Ach&aelig;ans; and so
completely altered the relative position of affairs,
that the Macedonians, from having been opponents,
became allies of the Ach&aelig;ans.

Sketch of the situation of Spartan affairs at this period: the
ancient constitution still continued to exist in form; but the
plunder of foreign countries, and particularly the permission to
transfer landed estates, obtained by Epitadeus, had produced
great inequality of property. The restoration of Lycurgus's constitution
had, therefore, a twofold object; to favour the poor by
a new agrarian law and release from debts, and to increase the
power of the kings by repressing that of the ephori.&mdash;First attempt
at reform 244, by king Agis III; attended in the beginning
with partial success, but eventually frustrated by the
other king, Leonidas, and terminating in the extinction of Agis
and his family, 241. Leonidas, however, was succeeded, 236,
by his son Cleomenes, who victoriously defeated the plans of
Aratus to force Sparta to accede to the Ach&aelig;an league, 227;
this king, by a forcible revolution, overthrew the ephori, and
accomplished the project of Agis, at the same time increasing[Pg 281]
the Spartans by the admission of a number of peri&aelig;ci; and enforcing
the laws of Lycurgus referring to private life; but as in
a small republic a revolution cannot be confirmed without some
external war, he attacked the Ach&aelig;ans as early as 224; these
being defeated, implored, through Aratus, the help of Antigonus;
Cleomenes in consequence was, at the battle of Sellasia, 222,
obliged to yield to superior force, and with difficulty escaped
over to Egypt; while Sparta was compelled to acknowledge her
independence as a gift at the hands of Antigonus. Such was
the miserable success of this attempt made by a few great men
on a nation already degenerate. The quarrels between the ephori
and king Lycurgus and his successor Machanidas, placed Sparta
in a state of anarchy, which ended, 207, in the usurpation of the
sovereign power by one Nabis, who destroyed the ancient form
of government. Let him who would study great revolutions
commence with that just described; insignificant as it is, none
perhaps furnishes more instructive lessons.

Plutarchi Agis et Cleomenes. The information in which
is principally drawn from the Commentaries of Aratus.

Philip II.
221&mdash;179.

15. Philip II. son of Demetrius. He ascended
the throne at the early age of sixteen, endowed
with many qualities, such as might, under favourable
circumstances, have formed a great prince.
Macedonia had recruited her strength during a
long peace; and her grand political aim, the supremacy
of Greece, secured by the connection of
Antigonus with the Ach&aelig;ans, and by the victory
of Sellasia, seemed to be already within her grasp.
But Philip lived in a time when Rome was pursuing
her formidable plans of aggrandizement:
the more vigorous and prompt his efforts were to
withstand that power, the more deeply was he
entangled in the new maze of events, which embittered
the rest of his life, and at last brought
him to the grave with a broken heart, converted
by misfortune into a despot.

War of the
two leagues,
221&mdash;217.

16. The first five years of Philip were occupied
[Pg 282]by his participation in the war between the
Ach&aelig;ans and &AElig;tolians, called the war of the two
leagues; notwithstanding the treachery of his
minister Apellas and his dependents, the prince
was enabled to dictate the conditions of peace,
according to which both parties were to remain
in possession of what they then had. The conclusion
of this peace was hastened by the news
of Hannibal's victory at Thrasymenus, Philip being
then instigated to form more extensive projects
by Demetrius of Pharus, who had fled before the
Romans, and soon acquired unlimited influence
with the Macedonian king.

The war of the two leagues arose out of the piracies of the
&AElig;tolians on the Messenians, the latter of whom the Ach&aelig;ans
undertook to protect, 221. The errors committed by Aratus
compelled the Ach&aelig;ans to have recourse to Philip, 220; whose
progress, however, was for a long time impeded by the artifices
of Apellas's faction, who wished to overthrow Aratus. The
Acarnanians, Epirots, Messenians, and Scerdilaidas of Illyria,
(who, however, soon after declared against Macedonia,) combined
with Philip and the Ach&aelig;ans; the &AElig;tolians, on the other
hand, commanded by their own general, Scopas, had for their
allies the Spartans and Eleans.&mdash;The most important consequence
of this war for Macedonia was, that she began again to
be a naval power.&mdash;About the same time a war broke out between
the two trading republics of Byzantium and Rhodes (the
latter supported by Prusias I. of Bithynia) insignificant in itself,
but which, as a commercial war, originating in the duties imposed
by the Byzantines, was the only one of its kind in this
age, 222. The Rhodians, so powerful in those days by sea, compelled
their adversaries to submit.

Negotiations
between
Philip
and
Hannibal,
214.

17. The negotiations between Philip and Hannibal
concluded with an alliance, in which reciprocal
help was promised towards annihilating
Rome. But Rome contrived to excite so many
foes against Philip on the borders of his own[Pg 283]
kingdom, and availed herself so skilfully of her
naval power, that the execution of this plan was
prevented until it became possible to attack the
Macedonian king in Greece; where he had made
himself many enemies, by the domineering tone
he had assumed towards his allies at the time
that, sensible of his power, he was about to enter
upon a wider sphere of action.

Commencement of hostilities by Rome, against Philip: immediately
that the alliance of Philip and Hannibal was known, a
squadron with troops on board was stationed off the coast of
Macedonia, by which the king himself was defeated at Apollonia,
214.&mdash;Alliance of Rome with the &AElig;tolians, joined likewise
by Sparta and Elis, Attalus king of Pergamus, and Scerdilaidas
and Pleuratus, kings of Illyria, 211. On Philip's side were the
Ach&aelig;ans, with whom Philop&#339;men more than supplied the loss
of Aratus, occasioned, 213, by the Macedonian king; to them
were joined the Acarnanians and B&aelig;otians.&mdash;Attacked on every
side, Philip successfully extricated himself from his difficulties;
in the first place, he compelled the &AElig;tolians, who had been
abandoned by Attalus and Rome, to accept separate terms,
which, shortly after, Rome, consulting her own convenience,
converted into a general peace, inclusive of the allies on either
side, 204.

War with
Attalus,
203&mdash;200.


18. New war of Philip against Attalus and the
Rhodians, carried on for the most part in Asia
Minor; and his impolitic alliance with Antiochus
III. to attack Egypt. But can Philip be blamed
for his endeavours to disarm the military servants
of the Romans? Rome, however, did not grant
him time to effect his designs; the Macedonian
king was taught at Chios, by woeful experience,
202.
that his navy had not increased proportionably
with that of the Rhodians.

War with
Rome,
200&mdash;197.

19. The war with Rome suddenly hurled the
Macedonian power from its lofty pitch; and by
laying the foundation of Roman dominion in the
[Pg 284]east, wrought a change in almost all the political
relations of that quarter. The first two years of
the war showed pretty evidently, that mere force
198.
could scarcely overturn the Macedonian throne.
But T. Quintius Flaminius stepped forward; with
the magic spell of freedom he intoxicated the
Greeks; Philip was stripped of his allies; and
the battle of Cynoscephal&aelig; decided everything.
197.
The articles of the peace were: 1. That all Grecian
cities in Europe and Asia should be independent,
and Philip should withdraw his garrisons.
2. That he should surrender the whole of
his navy, and never afterwards keep more than
500 armed men on foot. 3. That he should not,
without previously informing Rome, undertake
any war out of Macedonia. 4. That he should
pay 1,000 talents by instalments, and deliver up
his younger son Demetrius as an hostage.

The Roman allies in this war were: the &AElig;tolians, Athenians,
Rhodians, the kings of the Athamanes, Dardanians, and Pergamus.&mdash;The
Ach&aelig;ans at the beginning sided with Philip, but
were subsequently gained over by Flaminius. See below, in the
Roman History.

196.

20. Soon after, the freedom of Greece was
solemnly proclaimed at the Isthmian games by
Flaminius: but loud as the Greeks were in their
exultations, this measure served merely to transfer
the supremacy of their country from Macedonia
to Rome: and Grecian history, as well as the
Macedonian, is now interwoven with that of the
Romans. To foster quarrels between the Greek
states, with the especial view of hindering the
Ach&aelig;ans from growing too formidable, now became
a fundamental principle at Rome; and[Pg 285]
Roman and anti-Roman parties having quickly
arisen in every city, this political game was easily
played.

Flaminius even took care that the Ach&aelig;ans should have an
opponent in the person of Nabis, although under the necessity of
waging war against him previous to his return into Italy, 194.&mdash;In
192, war between Nabis and the Ach&aelig;ans; followed after
the murder of Nabis, at the hands of the &AElig;tolians, by the accession
of Sparta to the Ach&aelig;an league.&mdash;But about the same time
Greece once more became the theatre of foreign war; Antiochus
having firmly seated himself in the country, and enleagued
himself with several tribes, but more particularly the &AElig;tolians,
inspired with bitter and long-standing hatred against the
Romans. These last, however, after the expulsion of Antiochus
from Greece, 191, paid dearly for their secession; nor was peace
granted them by Rome till after long and unsuccessful supplications,
189.

Fate of
Philip.


21. While war was pending between the Romans
and Antiochus, Philip, in the character of
one of the numerous allies of Rome, ventured to
increase his territory at the expense of the Athamanes,
Thracians, and Thessalians. To keep
him in good humour he was permitted to effect
those conquests; but after the termination of
the war the oppression of Rome became so galling,
190.
that it could not be otherwise than that all
his thoughts should centre in revenge, and all his
exertions be directed towards the recovery of
power. Meanwhile the violent measures adopted
for repeopling his exhausted kingdom&mdash;such is
the punishment of ambition which usually awaits
even the victorious!&mdash;the transplantation of the
inhabitants of whole cities and countries, and the
consequent and unavoidable oppression of several
of his neighbours, excited universal complaints;
and where was the accuser of Philip to whom
[Pg 286]Rome would not now lend a ready ear?&mdash;His
younger son, Demetrius, the pupil of Rome, and
183.
by her intended, it is probable, to succeed to the
crown, alone diverted the impending fate of Macedonia.
But after the return of that prince from
his embassy, the envy of his elder and bastard
brother, Perseus, grew into an inveterate rancour,
such as could not be quenched but by the death
181.
of the younger. The lot of Philip was indeed
hard, compelled as a father to judge between his
two sons; but the measure of human woe was
filled, when after the death of his favourite child
he discovered that he was innocent; are we to
wonder that sorrow should soon have hurried him
179.
to a premature grave!

Roman policy
against
the Ach&aelig;an
league.
189.
183.

22. The same policy which was observed by
the Romans towards Philip, they pursued towards
the Ach&aelig;ans, with whom, since the termination
of the war with Antiochus, they had assumed a
loftier tone; and this artful game was facilitated
by the continual quarrels among the Greeks themselves.
Yet the great Philop&#339;men, worthy of a
better age, maintained the dignity of the league
at the very time that the Romans presumed to
speak as arbitrators. After his decease they
found it easy to raise a party among the Ach&aelig;ans
themselves, the venal Callicrates offering his services
for that purpose.

The Ach&aelig;ans was continually embroiled either with Sparta or
with Messene: the grounds of difference were, that in both of
those states there were factions headed by persons who, out of
personal motives, and for the most part hatred to Philop&#339;men,
wished to secede from the league; on the other hand, the prevailing
idea among the Ach&aelig;ans was, that this league ought to
comprise the whole of the Peloponnesus. In the war against the[Pg 287]
Messenians, 183, Philop&#339;men, at the age of seventy, was taken
prisoner by the enemy and put to death.

Plutarchi, Philop&#339;men. Nearly the whole of which is compiled

Perseus,
179&mdash;168.

23. The last Macedonian king, Perseus, had
inherited his father's perfect hatred of the Romans,
together with talents, if not equal, at least
but little inferior. He entered into the speculations
of his predecessor, and the first seven years
of his reign was occupied in constant exertions
to muster forces against Rome; with this view
he called the Bastarn&aelig; out of the north, in order
to settle them in the territories of his enemies the
Dardanians; he endeavoured to form alliances
with the kings of Illyria, Thrace, Syria, and Bithynia;
above all, he strove by negotiations and
promises to reestablish the ancient influence of
Macedonia in Greece.

The settlement of the Bastarn&aelig; (probably a German race, resident
beyond the Danube) in Thrace and Dardania, in order
with them to carry war against the Romans, was one of the plans
traced out by Philip, and now partially executed by Perseus.&mdash;In
Greece the Macedonian party, which Perseus formed chiefly
out of the great number of impoverished citizens in the country,
would probably have gained the upper hand, had not the fear inspired
by Rome, and the active vigilance of that power, interposed
an effectual bar. Hence the Ach&aelig;ans, apparently at least,
remained on the Roman side; the &AElig;tolians, by domestic factions,
had worked their own destruction; the case was the same
with the Acarnanians; and the federation of the B&#339;otians had
been completely dissolved by the Romans, 171. On the other
hand, in Epirus the Macedonian party was superior; Thessaly
was occupied by Perseus; several of the Thracian tribes were
friendly to him; and in king Gentius he found an ally who
might have been highly useful, had not the Macedonian prince,
by an ill-timed avarice, deprived himself of his assistance.

Defeat at Perseus at
Pidna.

24.  The commencement of open hostilities was
[Pg 288]hastened by the bitter hatred existing between
Perseus and Eumenes, and by the intrigues of
the latter at Rome. Neglect of the favourable
moment for taking the field, and the defensive
system, skilfully in other respects as it was
planned, caused the ruin of Perseus, as it had
done that of Antiochus.  Nevertheless he protracted
172&mdash;168.
the war to the fourth year, when the battle
of Pidna decided the fate both of himself and
his kingdom.

Miserable condition of Perseus until his capture at Samothrace;
and afterwards until his death at Rome, 166.

25. According to the system at that period followed
by Rome, the conquered kingdom of Macedonia
was not immediately converted into a province;
it was first deprived of all offensive power,
by being republicanized and divided into four
districts, wholly distinct from one another, and
bound to pay Rome half the tribute they were
before wont to furnish to their kings.

Fall of the
Ach&aelig;an
league.

26. It was in the natural order of things that
the independence of Greece, and more especially
that of the Ach&aelig;an league, should fall with Perseus.
The political inquisition of the Roman commissaries
not only visited with punishment the declared
partizans of Macedonia; but even to have
stood neutral was a crime that incurred suspicion.
Rome, however, amid the rising hatred, did not
deem herself secure until by one blow she had
rid herself of all opponents of any importance.
Above a thousand of the most eminent of the
Ach&aelig;ans were summoned to Rome to justify
themselves, and there detained seventeen years
Callicrates, 167&mdash;150.
in prison without a hearing. While at the head[Pg 289]
of the league, stood the man who had delivered
them up, Callicrates, (d. 150.) a wretch who could,
unmoved, hear "the very boys in the streets taunt
him with treachery."&mdash;A more tranquil period, it
is true, now ensued for Greece, but it was the
result of very obvious causes.

Greece becomes
a
Roman
province,
150&mdash;148.

27. The ultimate lot both of Macedon and
was decided by the system now adopted
at Rome, that of converting the previous dependence
of nations into formal subjection. The insurrection
of Andriscus in Macedonia, an individual
who pretended to be the son of Perseus, was
quelled by Metellus, the country being constituted
a Roman province; two years afterwards, at
the sack of Corinth, vanished the last glimmer of
Grecian freedom.

The last war of the Ach&aelig;ans arose out of certain quarrels with
Sparta, 150, fomented by Di&aelig;us, Critolaus, and Damocritus, who
had returned bitterly enraged from the Roman prison; in these
disputes Rome interfered, with the design of wholly dissolving
the Ach&aelig;an league. The first pretext that offered for executing
this scheme was the ill-treatment of the Roman ambassadors at
Corinth, 148; war, however, still raging with Carthage and
Andriscus, the Romans preserved for the present a peaceful tone.
But the party of Di&aelig;us and Critolaus would have war; the
plenipotentiaries of Metellus were again insulted, and the
Ach&aelig;ans declared war against Sparta and Rome. In the very
same year they were routed by Metellus, and their leader Critolaus
fell in the engagement; Metellus was replaced in the
command by Mummius, who defeated Di&aelig;us the successor of
Critolaus, took Corinth and razed it to the ground, 146. The
consequence was, that Greece, under the name of Achaia, became
a Roman province, although to a few cities, such as Athens, for
instance, some shadow of freedom was still left.

IV. History of some smaller or more distant Kingdoms
and States erected out of the Macedonian monarchy.

Sources. Besides the writers enumerated above, (see p. 232.)
Memnon, an historian of Heraclea in Pontus, deserves particular
mention in this place, (see p. 162): some extracts from his work
have been preserved to us by Photius, Cod. 224. In some individual
portions, as, for instance, in the Parthian history, Justin[a]
is our main authority; as are likewise Ammianus Marcellinus,
and the extracts from Arrian's Parthica, found in Photius. The
coins of the kings are also of great importance; but unfortunately
Vaillant's Essay shows, that even with their assistance the chronology
still remains in a very unsettled state. For the Jewish
history, Josephus (see p. 35.) is the grand writer: of the Books
of the Old Testament, those of Ezra and Nehemiah, together
with the Maccabees, although the last are not always to be depended
upon.

The modern writers are enumerated below, under the heads of
the different kingdoms. Much information is likewise scattered
about in the works on ancient numismatics.

[a] As Justin did no more than extract from Trogus Pompeius, a question
presents itself of great consequence to various portions of ancient history; what
authorities did Trogus Pompeius follow? The answer will be found in two
treatises by A. L. L. Heeren: De fontibus et auctoritate Trogi Pompeii, ejusque
epitomatoris Justini, inserted in Comment. Soc. Gott. vol. 15.

Smaller
states rising
out of Alexander's
empire.

1. Besides the three main empires into which
the monarchy of Alexander was divided, there
likewise arose in those extensive regions several
branch kingdoms, one of which even grew in time
to be among the most powerful in the world. To
these belong the kingdoms of, 1. Pergamus.
2. Bithynia. 3. Paphlagonia. 4. Pontus. 5. Cappadocia.
6. Great Armenia. 7. Little Armenia.
8. Parthia. 9. Bactria. 10. Jewish state subsequent
to the Maccabees.

[Pg 291]
We are acquainted with the history of these kingdoms, the
Jewish state alone excepted, only so far forth as they were implicated
in the concerns of the greater empires; of their internal
history we know little, often nothing. With respect to many of
them, therefore, little more can be produced than a series of
chronological data, indispensable, notwithstanding, to the general
historian.

Kingdom of
Pergamus,
B. C. 283&mdash;133.

2. The kingdom of Pergamus, in Mysia, arose
during the war between Seleucus and Lysimachus.
It owed its origin on the one hand to the
prudence of its rulers, the wisest of whom luckily
reigned the longest; and, on the other, to the
weakness of the Seleucid&aelig;: for its progressive
increase it was indebted to the Romans, who in
aggrandizing the power of Pergamus acted with a
view to their own interest. History exhibits
scarcely one subordinate kingdom whose princes
took such skilful advantage of the political circumstances
of the times; and yet they earned
still greater renown by the anxiety they showed,
in rivalling the Ptolemies, to foster the arts of
peace, industry, science, architecture, sculpture,
and painting. How dazzling the splendour with
which the small state of Pergamus outshines
many a mighty empire!

Philet&aelig;rus, lieutenant of Lysimachus, in Pergamus, asserts
his independence; and maintains possession of the citadel and
town, 283&mdash;263. His nephew, Eumenes I. 263&mdash;241, defeats
Antiochus I. at Sardes, 263, and becomes master of &AElig;olis and
the circumjacent country. His nephew, Attalus I. 241&mdash;197,
after his victory over the Galatians, 239, becomes king of Pergamus:
a noble prince, and one whose genius and activity embraced
everything. His wars against Ach&aelig;us brought him in
alliance with Antiochus III. 216. Commencement of an alliance
with Rome, arising out of his participation in the &AElig;tolian league
against Macedon, 211, in order to thwart Philip's project of conquest.
Hence, after Philip's irruption into Asia, 203, participa[Pg 292]tion
on the side of Rome, in the Macedonian war. His son Eumenes
II. the inheritor of all his father's great qualities succeeds
him, 197&mdash;158. As a reward for his assistance against Antiochus
the Great, the Romans presented him with almost all the
territories possessed by the vanquished king in Asia Minor,
(Phrygia, Mysia, Lycaonia, Lydia, Ionia, and a part of Caria,)
which thereafter constituted the kingdom of Pergamus; this
prince extended his frontiers, but lost his independence. In the
war with Perseus he was scarce able to preserve the good will of
the senate, and therewith his kingdom. His brother, Attalus II.
158&mdash;138, a more faithful dependent of Rome, took part in
nearly all the concerns of Asia Minor, more especially Bithynia.
His nephew, Attalus III. 138&mdash;133, a prince of unsound mind,
bequeathed his kingdom to the Romans, who, after vanquishing
the lawful heir, Aristonicus, 130, took possession of it, annexing
it to their empire, under the shape of a province called Asia.&mdash;Great
discoveries and vast establishments made at Pergamus.

as a present for Cleopatra. Museum. Discovery of parchment,
an invaluable auxiliary to the preservation of works of literature.

From the fall of Tyre and the unsuccessful attempt of Demetrius,
B. C. 307, to the establishment of Roman dominion in the
east, 300&mdash;200, was the brilliant period of Rhodes; alike important
for political wisdom, naval power, and extensive trade.
At the head of the senate (&#946;&#959;&#965;&#955;&#8052;) were presidents,
(&#960;&#961;&#965;&#964;&#945;&#957;&#949;&#8150;&#962;,)
who went out of office every half year, and were honoured with
precedence in the meetings of the commons. Friendship with
all, alliance with none, was the fundamental maxim of Rhodian
policy, until subverted by Rome. Thus was preserved the dignity
of the state, together with its independence and political
activity&mdash;where do we not meet with Rhodian embassies?&mdash;and
permanent splendour, resulting from the cultivation of arts and
sciences. What proofs of general commiseration did not Rhodes
enjoy after that dreadful earthquake, which threw down even the
famous colossus, 227! Long did her squadrons command the
&AElig;g&aelig;an; over that sea, the Euxine, and the western parts of the[Pg 293]
Mediterranean as far as Sicily, her commerce extended, consisting
in the rich exchange of commodities between three quarters
of the globe. Her revenue proceeded from the customs, and was
abundant; until, blinded by avarice, she sought to obtain at
Per&aelig;a a territory on the mainland; an ambition of which the
Romans availed themselves to her detriment, by presenting her
with Lycia and Caria, 190. And yet did this republic outlive that
of Rome! Great, indeed, is the chasm left in general history by
the loss of the internal history of this island!

3. The other small kingdoms of Asia Minor are
fragments rather of the Persian than of the Macedonian
monarchy; for Alexander's march following
another direction, they were not formally
subjugated by that conqueror. The lines of their
kings are generally traced back to an early period
of the Persian age; but, properly speaking, their
rulers in those days were nothing more than viceroys:
selected indeed, for the most part, from the
royal family, they bore the title of princes, and,
in the gradual decline of the empire, not unfrequently
threw up their allegiance. Nevertheless
these kingdoms do not appear as really independent
until after the time of Alexander. Connected
with the Grecian republics Heraclea, Sinope,
Byzantium, etc. they formed, both in the
Macedonian and Roman ages, a system of small
states, often distracted by internal wars, and still
oftener mere tools in the hands of the more
powerful.

1. Bithynia. As early as the Persian period, mention is made
of two kings in Bithynia, Dydalsus and Botyras. The son of
the latter, Bias, B. C. 378&mdash;328, made head against Caranus,
one of Alexander's generals; as did also his son Zip&#339;tas, d. 281,
against Lysimachus.&mdash;Lycomedes I. d. 248. He called the Gauls[Pg 294]
over from Thrace, 278, and with their assistance deposed his
brother Zip&#339;tas; the Gauls in consequence kept their footing in
Galatia, and were for a long time an object of terror to Asia
Minor. Zelas, d. about 232; established his dominion after a
war with his half-brothers. Prusias I. son-in-law and ally of
Philip II. of Macedon, d. 192. He sided with the Rhodians
in the commercial war against Byzantium, 222, (see above,
p. 282.) and directed his arms, 196, against Heraclea, a Grecian
city in Bithynia, with a respectable territory along shore. Prusias
II. waged war against Eumenes II. at the instigation of
Hannibal, who had fled to his court, 184; he was subsequently
about to deliver up the fugitive to the Romans; had not Hannibal
put a period to his existence, 183: this king likewise waged
war against Attalus II. 153; in both these contests Rome acted
as mediator. Prusias, who had the meanness to style himself a
freedman of the Romans, was dethroned by his own son, Nicomedes
II. d. 92; a confederate of Mithridates the Great, with
whom, nevertheless, he afterwards fell out concerning the appropriation
of Paphlagonia and Cappadocia. Nicomedes was murdered
by his son Socrates, who was, however, compelled to flee;
in consequence of which Nicomedes III. succeeded to the crown.
Deposed by Mithridates, who supported his half-brother Socrates,
he was reinstated by Rome, 90. Having, however, at the instigation
of the Romans, 89, attacked Mithridates, he was defeated
and expelled in the first Mithridatic war, now kindled; but in
the peace of 85, he was again reinstated by Sulla. At his death,
75, he bequeathed Bithynia to the Romans; and this legacy gave
rise to the third Mithridatic war.

Vaillant, Imperium Arsacidarum, vol. ii. See below.

Sevin, Recherches sur les rois de Bithynie; inserted in the
M&eacute;m. de l'Acad&eacute;mie des Inscript. vol. xii.

2. Paphlagonia. Even in the Persian age, the rulers of this
country were but nominally subject. After Alexander's death,
B. C. 323, it fell into the hands of the kings of Pontus; it was,
however, subsequently, again ruled by its own monarchs; among
whom we hear of Morzes, about 179; Pyl&aelig;menes I. about 131:
who assisted the Romans in the war against Aristonicus of Pergamus.&mdash;Pyl&aelig;menes
II. d. before 121; who is said to have bequeathed
his kingdom to Mithridates V. of Pontus. Hence
Paphlagonia came to be implicated in the fortunes of Pontus,
(see just below,) until after the fall of Mithridates the Great, 63,[Pg 295]
that kingdom was converted into a province, with the exception
of one of the southern districts, to which the Romans left some
shadow of freedom.

3. Pontus. The later kings of this country derived their origin
from the family of the Ach&aelig;menid&aelig;, or house of Persia. In the
Persian age they remained dependent or tributary princes: and
as such we must consider Artabazes, son of Hystaspes, d. 480,
Mithridates I. d. 368, and Ariobarzanes, d. 337, mentioned as
the earliest kings of Pontus.  Mithridates II. surnamed Ctistes,
d. 302, was one of the first to acknowledge subjection to Alexander;
after the death of the conqueror he sided with Antigonus,
who treacherously caused him to be murdered. His son, Mithridates
III. d. 266, (the Ariobarzanes of Memnon,) not only maintained
himself after the battle of Ipsus against Lysimachus, but
likewise possessed himself of Cappadocia and Paphlagonia. Mithridates
IV. father-in-law to Antiochus the Great, waged an unsuccessful
war against Sinope. The year of his death is undetermined,
Pharnaces, d. about 156. He conquered Sinope 183;
and that town then became the royal residence. War with Eumenes
II. whom Rome had made so powerful, and with his allies;
terminated by a treaty, according to which Pharnaces ceded
Paphlagonia, B. C. 179. Mithridates V. d. about 121. He was
an ally of the Romans, from whom, after the defeat of Aristonicus
of Phrygia, he contrived to obtain Great Phrygia. Mithridates
VI. surnamed Eupator, about 121&mdash;64. He bore the title of
Great, an epithet to which he was as fully entitled as Peter I. in
modern history; indeed he resembled the Russian prince in
almost everything except in good fortune. His reign, although
of the highest importance to general history, is, particularly in
the portion previous to the wars with Rome, replete with chronological
difficulties.&mdash;At the age of twelve years he inherits from
his father not only Pontus, but likewise Phrygia, and a reversionary
title to the throne of Paphlagonia, vacated by the death
of Pyl&aelig;menes II.&mdash;During his nonage, 121&mdash;112, while by
voluntarily inuring himself to hardships, he contrived to elude
the treacherous hostility of his guardians, Rome deprived him of
Phrygia. His conquests in Colchis and on the eastern side of
the Black sea, 112&mdash;110.&mdash;Commencement of the Scythian wars.
Called by the Greeks of Crimea to their assistance, he expelled
the Scythians; subjected several insignificant Scythian princes
on the mainland; and entered into alliances with the Sarmatic[Pg 296]
and even Germanic races as far as the Danube, 108&mdash;105, having
already a view to the invasion of Italy from the north.&mdash;This war
ended, he travels over Asia, (Asia Minor?) about 104&mdash;103.&mdash;At
his return, after punishing with death his faithless sister and wife,
Laodice, he makes good his pretensions to Paphlagonia, which he
divides with Nicomedes II. 102. The Roman senate demanding
the restoration of that province, Mithridates not only refuses to
accede, but likewise takes possession of Galatia; meanwhile Nicomedes
places on the throne of Paphlagonia one of his own sons,
whom he gives out to be a son of Pyl&aelig;menes II. and denominates
Pyl&aelig;menes III.&mdash;Rupture with Nicomedes II. 101; the
subject of dispute, Cappadocia, which, after removing the king,
Ariarathes VII. his brother-in-law, with the assistance of Gordius,
Mithridates himself now wished to possess; he is anticipated,
however, by Nicomedes II. who marries Laodice, Ariarathes's
widow.&mdash;Mithridates, notwithstanding, expels his rival, under
pretence of holding the kingdom for his sister's son, Ariarathes
VIII. whom at the end of a few months he puts to death at a
private conference, 94; he defeats the brother of the murdered
prince, Ariarathes IX. and then places on the throne, under the
name of Ariarathes X. his own son, who is given out to be a third
son of Ariarathes VII; in opposition to whom Nicomedes sets up
another pretended Ariarathes. The Roman senate, meanwhile,
declare both Paphlagonia and Cappadocia free, B. C. 92; attending,
however, to the desires of the Cappadocians, they sanction
the election of Ariobarzanes to the crown; and he is put in possession
of the kingdom by Sylla, as propr&aelig;tor of Cilicia, likewise
in 92.&mdash;Mithridates, on the other hand, forms an alliance with
the king of Armenia, Tigranes, to whom he gives his daughter in
marriage; and employs him in expelling Ariobarzanes.&mdash;He
himself, after the death of Nicomedes II. 92, supports the claims
of the deceased king's exiled son, Socrates Chrestus, against the
bastard Nicomedes III. and in the mean time takes possession of
Paphlagonia. Nicomedes and Ariobarzanes are reinstated by a
Roman embassy, 90, Mithridates, in order to gain time against
Rome, causing Socrates to be put to death. The hostilities of
Nicomedes, instituted by Rome, gave rise to the first Roman war,
89&mdash;85, carried on in Asia and Greece, and brought to a conclusion
by Sylla. By the peace of 85, Mithridates restores Bithynia,
Cappadocia, and Paphlagonia.&mdash;War with the revolted
Colchians and Bosporans, 84.&mdash;Second war with Rome brought[Pg 297]
about by the Roman governor, Murena, 83&mdash;81. Mithridates
hereupon appoints his son, Machares, king of Bosporus, (Crimea,)
whom he afterwards himself causes to be put to death, 66; he
was likewise, in all probability, the instigator of the migration of
the Sarmat&aelig; out of Asia into Europe, in order to maintain his
conquests in that quarter, about 80. Fresh disputes with Rome
about Cappadocia, of which Tigranes takes possession, and third
war with Rome, 75&mdash;64. The contest ended in the downfal of
Mithridates, caused by the treachery of his son Pharnaces;
Pontus became a Roman province; although the Romans, in the
sequel, appointed over a portion of the country princes from the
royal house, Darius, Polemo I. Polemo II. until Nero reduced
it again wholly to the state of a province.

without sufficient chronological accuracy, see De Brosses, Histoire

Magni, per annos digestam, sistens; pr&aelig;mio ornata ab A. Phil.
Ord. Gotting&aelig;:, A. 1812.

4. Cappadocia. Until the time of Alexander this country
remained a province of the Persian empire, although the governors
occasionally made attempts at insurrection. The ruling family
was here likewise a branch of the royal house; Ariarathes I. was
particularly distinguished about B. C. 354. The prince contemporary
with Alexander was Ariarathes II. who, being attacked
by Perdiccas and Eumenes, fell in the contest, 322. Nevertheless,
his son, Ariarathes III. supported by the Armenians, recovered
the sceptre about 312. The son of this king, Ariaramnes,
formed a matrimonial connection with the Seleucid&aelig;, uniting his
son Ariarathes IV. with the daughter of Antiochus &#920;&#949;&#972;&#962;. Ariarathes
IV. during his lifetime, associated in the government his son
Ariarathes V. d. 162. who married Antiochis, daughter to Antiochus
the Great: this princess, finding herself at first barren,
procured two supposititious sons, one of whom, Orophernes, subsequently
wrested the sceptre from the legitimate and later born
son, Ariarathes VI. but was afterwards expelled by the rightful
heir, 157. In the war against Aristonicus of Pergamus, 131, he
fell, as an ally of the Romans, leaving behind him six sons; five of
whom were cut off by his ambitious relict Laodice; the sixth[Pg 298]
however, Ariarathes VII. ascended the throne, and was married
to Laodice, sister of Mithridates the Great, at whose instigation
he was murdered by Gordius, under pretence of placing on the
throne his sister's son, Ariarathes VIII; this last prince was soon
after treacherously put to death by Mithridates, 94, and his brother
Ariarathes IX. defeated 93, died of a broken heart; Mithridates
then placed on the throne his own son, Ariarathes X. a lad
eight years old. The independence of Cappadocia having meanwhile
been proclaimed at Rome, the inhabitants of the country,
in order to preclude domestic broils, themselves elect a king, appointing
to that dignity Ariobarzanes I. who was installed by
Sylla, 92, and, backed by the Romans, kept his footing in the
Mithridatic wars. In 63 he made the crown over to his son,
Ariobarzanes II. who was slain by the army of Brutus and Cassius,
43, as was his brother, Ariobarzanes III. 34, by Mark
Antony; Antony then appointed Archelaus to be king, who enticed
to Rome by Tiberius, A. D. 17, was there assassinated;
and Cappadocia then became a Roman province.

5. Armenia was a province of the Syrian empire until the defeat
of Antiochus the Great by Rome, 190. That defeat was
followed by the accession of Antiochus's lieutenants, Artaxias
and Zariadras; and now arose the two kingdoms of Armenia
Major and Armenia Minor (the latter on the west bank of the
Upper Euphrates). In Armenia Major the family of Artaxias
kept possession of the throne, under eight (according to others
ten) consecutive kings, until B. C. 5.&mdash;The only remarkable
prince of this line was Tigranes I. 95&mdash;60, son-in-law and ally
of Mithridates the Great, and lord of Asia Minor, Cappadocia,
and Syria. He was, however, at the peace of 63, obliged to give
up all, so that Armenia was dependent on the Romans, and remained
so until B. C. 5, when it became the object of contention
between the Romans and Parthians, being ruled at intervals by
kings appointed by both parties, who endeavoured thereby to
protect their own provinces. Finally, in A. D. 412, Armenia became
a province of the new Persian empire.&mdash;In Asia Minor the
descendants of Zariadras ruled dependently on Rome; after its
defection under Mithridates the Great it usually formed part of
some one of the neighbouring kingdoms, until in the reign of
Vespasian it was converted into a province of the Roman empire.

Imp. Arsacidarum.[Pg 299]

Bactrian
and Parthian
empires.

4. Besides the above small kingdoms, two
mighty empires arose in Inner Asia, both out
of Alexander's monarchy, and at the same time:
these were the Parthian and the Bactrian; each
having previously constituted a part of the empire
of the Seleucid&aelig;, from which they seceded under
Antiochus II. The Parthian kingdom, or that of
the Arsacid&aelig;, B. C. 256&mdash;A. D. 226, at the maximum
of its extension, comprised the countries
between the Euphrates and Indus. Its history,
so far as we are acquainted with it, is divided
into four periods (see below); but unfortunately
our information is so imperfect respecting all that
relates to the Parthians, except their wars, that
even the most important particulars are beyond
the reach of conjecture.

Main facts in the history and constitution of the Parthian kingdom.
a. Like the ancient Persian empire, the Parthian arose out
of the conquests made by a rude mountain race of Central Asia,
whose Scythian (probably Tatarian) origin, betrayed itself even in
later times by their speech and mode of life: their conquests,
however, were not effected with the same rapidity as those of the
Persians. b. This empire increased at the expense of the Syrian
in the west, and of the Bactrian in the east; but its dominion was
never permanently established beyond the Euphrates, Indus, and
Oxus. c. The wars with Rome, commencing in B. C. 53, and
springing out of disputes for the possession of the Armenian
throne, were for a long time unfortunate for the Romans. Success
did not accompany the arms of Rome until she had discovered the
art of raising her own parties within the kingdom itself, by lending
her support to pretenders, an art rendered comparatively easy,
by the unfavourable situation of the Parthian capital Seleucia
and the neighbouring town of Ctesiphon, the real head quarters
of the court. d. The empire was indeed divided into satrapies,
eighteen of which are enumerated; nevertheless it comprised
likewise several small kingdoms, which preserved their own[Pg 300]
rulers, only that they were tributary, such, for instance, as Persis,
etc. The Gr&aelig;co-Macedonian settlements were also in possession
of great privileges, and of their own civic governments;
Seleucia more especially, where the coins of the Parthian sovereigns
were struck. e. The constitution was monarchal-aristocratic,
something like that of the Poles, in the period of the
Jagellons. At the king's side sat a supreme state council, (senatus,
in all probability what was called the megistanes,) who had
the power of deposing the king, and the privilege, it is supposed,
of confirming his accession previous to the ceremony of coronation,
performed by the field-marshals (surenas). The right of
succession was only so far determined as belonging to the house
of the Arsacid&aelig;; the many pretenders to which this uncertainty
gave rise, produced factions and domestic wars, doubly injurious
to the empire when fomented and shared by foreigners. f. With
regard to Asiatic commerce, the Parthian supremacy was of importance,
inasmuch as it interrupted the direct intercourse between
the western and eastern countries: it being a maxim of
the Parthians not to grant a passage through their country to any
stranger. This destruction of the trade occurs in the third period
of the empire, being a natural result of the many wars with
Rome, and the distrust thence ensuing. The East India trade,
in consequence, took another road through Palmyra and Alexandria,
which were indebted to it for their splendour and prosperity.
g. It is probable that this was the reason why excessive
luxury took a less hold on the Parthians than on the other ruling
nations of Asia, notwithstanding their predilection for Grecian
manners and literature, at that time generally prevalent throughout
the east.

Line of the kings. I. Syrian period; that of reiterated wars
with the Seleucid&aelig;, until 130. Arsaces I. 256&mdash;253, founder of
the Parthian independence, by procuring the death of the Syrian
viceroy, Agathocles, to which he was instigated by the insult
offered to his brother Tiridates. Arsaces II. (Tiridates I.) brother
of the foregoing, d. 216. He possessed himself of Hyrcania,
about 244, confirmed the Parthian power by a victory on Seleucus
Callinicus, 238, whom he took prisoner, 236. Arsaces III.
(Artabanus I.) d. 196. In his reign occurred the unsuccessful
attempt of Antiochus III. who, in the treaty of 210, was obliged
to renounce all claims on Parthia and Hyrcania, in return for
which Arsaces lent his assistance to Antiochus in the war against[Pg 301]
Bactria. Arsaces IV. (Priapatius,) d. about 181. Arsaces V.
(Phraates I.) d. about 144; he conquered the Mardians on the
Caspian. His brother, Arsaces VI. (Mithridates I.) d. 136. He
raised the hitherto confined kingdom of Parthia to the rank of a
mighty empire, having, after the decease of Antiochus Epiphanes,
164, by the capture of Media, Persis, Babylonia, and other
countries, extended the frontiers westward to the Euphrates, and
eastward to the Hydaspes, beyond the Indus. The invasion of
Demetrius II. of Syria, supported by an insurrection of the conquered
races, ended, 140, in the capture of the aggressor. Arsaces
VII. (Phraates II.) d. about 127. Invasion of Antiochus
Sidetes, 132, who was at first successful, but being soon afterwards
cut off together with his whole army, 131, the Parthian
empire was for ever freed from the attacks of the Syrian kings.

II. Period of the eastern nomad wars; from 130&mdash;53. After
the fall of the Bactrian empire, which had hitherto formed the
eastern rampart of the Parthians, violent wars took place with
the nomad tribes of Central Asia (Scyth&aelig;, Dah&aelig;, Tochari, etc.)
in which Arsaces VII. was slain. Arsaces VIII. (Artabanus II.)
shared the same fate about 124. Arsaces IX. (Mithridates II.)
d. 87. This prince appears to have restored tranquillity to the
east after bloody wars; he met, however, with a powerful rival
in Tigranes I. of Armenia. In his reign occurred the first transactions
between the Parthians and Romans, 92, Sylla being propr&aelig;tor
of Cilicia. Arsaces X. (Mnasciras,) d. about 76, waged
a long war for the succession with his follower on the throne, the
septuagenarian, Arsaces XI. (Sinatroces,) d. about 68. Unsuccessful
war with Tigranes I. In consequence of civil wars, and of
that with Tigranes, together with the formidable power of Mithridates
the Great, the Parthian empire was now greatly weakened.
Arsaces XII. (Phraates III.) d. 60, contemporary with the third
Mithridatic war. Although both parties eagerly courted his alliance,
and he himself was engaged in the contest with Tigranes,
he, notwithstanding, observed an armed neutrality, and made the
Parthian empire continue to be respected as far as the Euphrates.
Neither Lucullus nor Pompey durst attack him. The fall of
Mithridates and of his empire, 64, constitutes, however, an epoch
in the Parthian history, the Romans and Parthians having now
become immediate neighbours.&mdash;Arsaces XIII. (Mithridates II.)
d. 54, deposed after several wars, by his younger brother Orodes,[Pg 302]
and at last put to death, after the capture of Babylonia, where
he had taken refuge.

III. Roman period; from B. C. 53, to A. D. 226; comprising
the wars with Rome. Arsaces XIV. (Orodes I.) d. 36. In his
reign the first war with Rome, caused by the invasion of Crassus;
it ends in the annihilation of the invading army and general,
53. In consequence of this victory the Parthians acquired such
preponderance, that during the civil wars they were frequently
masters on this side of the Euphrates, and in 52&mdash;51 proceeded
to attack Syria.&mdash;In the war between Pompey and C&aelig;sar they
sided with the former, and thus furnished the latter with a pretext
for his Parthian expedition, which, however, was prevented
by his murder in 44; again in the war between the triumviri
and Brutus and Cassius, 42, they took the republican side. After
the defeat of Brutus and Cassius, the Parthians, at the instigation
of the Roman general and ambassador Labienus, and commanded
by him and Pacorus, (eldest son to Arsaces,) spread over the
whole of Syria and Asia Minor, 40; but, after violent exertions,
were driven back by Ventidius, Antony's general, 39, 38; Pacorus
lost his life, and his father died of grief. Arsaces XV.
(Phraates IV.) d. A. D. 4, contemporary of Augustus. He confirmed
his power by murdering his brothers and their dependents;
his views were likewise furthered by the failure of Antony's
expedition, B. C. 36, which ended pretty nearly in the
same manner as that of Crassus. The remainder of his reign
was disturbed by a pretender to the throne, Tiridates, who, after
his defeat, 25, found an asylum at the court of Augustus. The
threatened attack of Augustus was diverted by Phraates's restoration
of the standards taken from Crassus, 20; a dispute,
however, subsequently arose respecting the possession of the Armenian
throne, A. D. 2, on which account Caius C&aelig;sar was despatched
into Asia, and accommodated matters by a treaty. The
ultimate fate both of the king and the empire was principally
decided by a female slave, Thermusa, sent as a present from Augustus;
this woman, wishing to ensure the succession to her own
son, prevailed upon the king to send his four sons to Rome as
hostages, under the pretext of anticipating domestic troubles, 18.&mdash;A
practice which from that time became frequent, the Parthian
kings thinking it a convenient mode of ridding themselves of
dangerous competitors, while the Romans knew how to make the[Pg 303]
proper use of them.&mdash;Thermusa's son having grown up, she removed
the king, and seated Phraataces on the throne, under the
name of Arsaces XVI; he was, however, put to death by the
Parthians, A. D. 4; and the crown given to one of the Arsacid&aelig;,
Orodes II, (Arsaces XVII.) who was, however, immediately afterwards
slain by reason of his cruelty. In consequence, Vonones
I. the eldest of the sons of Phraates sent to Rome, was
called back and placed on the throne (Arsaces XVIII.); but
that prince having brought with him Roman customs and luxury,
was expelled, A. D. 14, with the assistance of the northern nomads,
by Artabanes III. (Arsaces XIX.) d. 44, a distant relation:
the fugitive took possession of the vacant throne of Armenia,
but was soon after driven from thence likewise by his rival.
Tiberius took advantage of the consequent disorders to send Germanicus
into the east, A. D. 17, from whence he was never to return.
The remainder of the reign of Artabanus was very stormy,
Tiberius on the one hand taking advantage of the factions
between the nobles to support pretenders to the crown; the
revolts of the satraps, on the other hand, giving proof of the declension
of the Parthian power. After his death war raged between
his sons; the second, Vardanes, (Arsaces XX.) d. 47,
made good his pretensions to the crown, and took North Media,
(Atropatene;) he was succeeded by his elder brother Gotarzes,
(Arsaces XXI.) d. 50, to whom Claudius unsuccessfully opposed
Meherdates, educated as an hostage at Rome. Arsaces XXII.
(Vonones II.) succeeded, after a reign of a few months, by Arsaces
XXIII. (Vologeses I.) d. 90. The possession of the Armenian
throne, given by this prince to his brother Tiridates, by the
Romans to Tigranes, grandson of Herod the Great, excited a
series of disputes, which began so early as the reign of Claudius,
A. D. 52, and under Nero broke out into open war, waged with
some success on the Roman side by Corbulo, 56&mdash;64, and closed
by Tiridates going, after the death of Tigranes, to Rome, and
there accepting the crown of Armenia as a gift at the hands of
Nero, 65. Arsaces XXIV. (Pacorus,) d. 107, contemporary with
Domitian. All that we know of him is, that he embellished the
city of Ctesiphon. Arsaces XXV. (Cosroes,) d. about 121. The
claims to the throne of Armenia implicated him in a war with
Trajan, 114, during which Armenia, together with Mesopotamia
and Assyria, were converted into Roman provinces. Trajan's
consequent and successful inroad into the interior parts of the[Pg 304]
Parthian dominions, 115&mdash;116, followed by the capture of Ctesiphon,
and the appointment of Parthamaspates as king, appears
to have been facilitated by the domestic commotions and civil
wars which had for a long time harassed the empire. Nevertheless,
in the following year, 117, Hadrian was compelled to give
up all the conquered country; the Euphrates was again acknowledged
as the boundary; Parthamaspates was appointed king of
Armenia; and Cosroes, who had taken refuge in the upper satrapies,
was reinstated on the throne, of which he seems ever after
to have kept quiet possession. Arsaces XXVI. (Vologeses II.)
d. 149. Parthia under his reign, and Rome under that of Antoninus
Pius, remained on good terms. Arsaces XXVII. (Vologeses
III.) d. 191. Under the reign of this king, the contemporary
of Marcus Aurelius and L. Verus, the war with Rome was
again kindled, 161, by Verus, and carried on in Armenia and
Syria; Cassius, the legate of Verus, at last got possession of
Seleucia, and demolished that city, 165.&mdash;Arsaces XXVIII.
(Ardawan or Vologeses IV.) d. 207. This king having taken
the part of Pescenninus Niger, in the war between him and Septimius
Severus, was, after the defeat of his friend, 194, routed in
a war with Septimius Severus, 197, and the chief towns of Parthia
were sacked by the invaders. He is, without authority, represented
as succeeded by a Pacorus, who took the name of Arsaces
XXIX.: his real successor, however, appears to have been Arsaces
XXIX. (Vologeses V.) d. 216. Domestic wars among his
sons, fomented by Caracalla. Arsaces XXX. (Artabanus IV.)
At the beginning of his reign, this prince likewise was contemporary
with Caracalla, who, in order to pick a quarrel, demanded
his daughter in marriage; according to some, Arsaces refused
her, in consequence of which the Roman emperor undertook a
campaign into Armenia; according to others, Arsaces having assented,
and escorted his daughter to Caracalla, was, by an abominable
stroke of treachery, cut off, together with all his train,
A. D. 216. Caracalla having been murdered, 217, his successor,
Macrinus, signed a peace with the Parthians. But Arsaces subsequently
raised his brother Tiridates to the throne of Armenia;
this act spurred the Persian Artaxerxes, son of Sassan, to rebellion;
the Parthian king, defeated in three battles, fell in the last,
thus putting a period to the family and dominion of the Arsacid&aelig;,
226, and Artaxerxes became the founder of the New Persian
kingdom, or that of the Sassanid&aelig;. The revolution was
[Pg 305]
accompanied not only with a change of dynasty, but with a total
subversion of the constitution.

by the assistance of coins.

Bactria.

5. The Bactrian kingdom arose nearly at the
same time as the Parthian, 254; its origin, however,
was of a different nature,&mdash;the independence
of this state being asserted by the Grecian
governor, who was consequently succeeded by
Greeks;&mdash;its duration likewise was much shorter,
extending only from B. C. 254 to B. C. 126.
Scarce any fragments have been preserved of the
history of this empire, the borders of which appear
at one time to have extended to the banks
of the Ganges, and the frontiers of China.

Founder of the empire, Diodatus or Theodotus I. B. C. 254;
he threw off his allegiance to the Syrian king, under Antiochus
II. He appears to have been master not only of Bactria, but
also of Sogdiana. He likewise threatened the Parthians; after
his decease, 243, his son and successor, Theodotus II. signed a
treaty and alliance with Arsaces II. but was nevertheless deprived
of his crown by Euthydemus of Magnesia, about 221. Antiochus
the Great, at the conclusion of the Parthian war, directed his
arms against Euthydemus, 209&mdash;206; the contest ended in a
peace, by which Euthydemus, after delivering up his elephants,[Pg 306]
was not only left in possession of the crown, but was allied to the
Syrian family by the marriage of his son Demetrius with a
daughter of Antiochus. Demetrius, though a great conqueror,
does not seem to have been king of Bactria; his dominions comprised,
it is probable, North India and Malabar, whose history
now becomes closely connected with that of Bactria, although
consisting only of mere fragments. The throne of Bactria fell to
Apollodotus, and after him to Menander, who extended his conquests
as far as Serica, while Demetrius was establishing his dominion
in India, [as sovereign of which country he is represented
in a medal lately discovered,] and where, about this time, several
Greek states appear to have existed, perhaps ever since the expedition
of Antiochus III. 205. Menander was succeeded, about
181, by Eucratidas, under whose reign the Bactrian empire attained
its greatest extension; after defeating the Indian king,
Demetrius, who had been the aggressor, he, with the assistance
of the Parthian conqueror, Mithridates, (Arsaces VI.) annexed
India to his own empire, 148. On his return, he was murdered
by his son; the same, probably, that is mentioned afterwards by
the name of Eucratidas II. He was the ally of Demetrius II. of
Syria, and the main instigator of his expedition against the Parthians,
142; Demetrius being defeated by Arsaces VI. Eucratidas
was, in consequence, deprived of a portion of his territory;
overpowered soon after by the nomad races of Central Asia, the
Bactrian empire fell to the ground, and Bactria itself, together
with the other countries on this side of the Oxus, became a prey
to the Parthians.

Kingdom of
the Jews.

6. The restored kingdom of the Jews was likewise
a fragment of the Macedonian monarchy;
and although it ranked only with the smaller
states, its history in various respects deserves our
attention, few nations having had so powerful an[Pg 307]
influence on the progress of human civilization.
The foundation of the independence of the Jews
was not, it is true, laid before the year 167;
yet their domestic constitution had previously
assumed its main features, and their history,
reckoning from the return of the Babylonian captivity,
accordingly divides itself into four periods:
1. Under the Persian supremacy, 536&mdash;323. 2.
Under the Ptolemies and Seleucid&aelig;, 323&mdash;167.
3. Under the Maccabees, 167&mdash;39. 4. Under
the Herodians and Romans, B. C. 39. to A. D. 70.

First period under the Persians. By permission from Cyrus,
a colony of Jews belonging to the tribes of Benjamin, Judah, and
Levi, returned to the land of their forefathers, 536: this colony,
headed by Zorobabel, of the ancient royal family, and the high
priest Joshua, consisted of about 42,000 souls; the far more important
and wealthy portion of the nation preferred to remain on
the other side of the Euphrates, where they had been settled for
seventy years, and continued to be a numerous people. The new
settlers found it difficult to keep their footing, principally in consequence
of differences, produced by the intolerance they themselves
evinced at the building of the temple, with their neighbours
and kinsmen the Samaritans, to whom the colony was only a
cause of expense. The Samaritans, subsequently, having erected
a separate temple at Garizim, near Sichem, about 336, not only
separated completely, but laid the foundation of an inveterate
hatred between the two nations. Hence the prohibition to rebuild
the city and temple, brought about by their means, under
Cambyses, 529, and Smerdis, 522, and not taken off until 520,
in the reign of Darius Hystaspes. The new colony did not receive
a permanent internal constitution till the time of Ezra and
Nehemiah; both brought in fresh colonists, the former in 478,
the latter in 445. The country was under the dominion of the
satraps of Syria; but in the increasing domestic declension of the
Persian empire, the high priests gradually became the virtual
rulers of the nation. Nevertheless, even at the time of Alexander's
conquest, 332, the Jews seem to have manifested proofs of
fidelity to the Persians.
[Pg 308]
Second period under the Ptolemies and Seleucid&aelig;, 323&mdash;167.
After the death of Alexander, Palestine, in consequence of its
situation, generally shared the fate of Ph&#339;nicia and C&#339;le-Syria,
(see above, p. 249.) being annexed to Syria.&mdash;Capture of Jerusalem,
and transplantation of a vast colony of Jews to Alexandria
by Ptolemy I. 312; from thence they spread to Cyrene, and
gradually over the whole of North Africa, and even into &AElig;thiopia.
From 311&mdash;301 the Jews remained, however, subject to
Antigonus. After the overthrow of his empire, they remained,
301&mdash;203, under the dominion of the Ptolemies; the most conspicuous
of their high priests during this interval were Simon the
Just, d. 291, and afterwards his son, Onias I. d. 218, who, by
withholding the tribute due to Ptolemy III. exposed Jud&aelig;a to
imminent danger.&mdash;In the second war of Antiochus the Great
against Egypt, 203, the Jews, of their own free will, acknowledged
themselves his subjects, and assisted in driving out the
Egyptian troops, who, under their general, Scopas, had again
possessed themselves of the country, and the citadel of Jerusalem,
198. Antiochus confirmed the Jews in the possession of all their
privileges; and although he promised their country, together
with C&#339;le-Syria and Ph&#339;nicia, to Ptolemy Epiphanes, as the
future dowry of his daughter, Jud&aelig;a still remained under the
Syrian supremacy; except that the revenue was for a time divided
between the Syrian and Egyptian kings.&mdash;The high priests
and self-chosen ethnarchs or alabarchs were at the head of the
people; and we now find mention made for the first time of a
senate, or the sanhedrim. But the rout of Antiochus the Great
by the Romans was also the remote cause of the subsequent misfortunes
of the Jews. The consequent dearth of money in which
the Syrian kings found themselves, and the riches of the temple
treasures, the accumulation of the sacred income and gifts, made
the office of high priest an object of purchase under Antiochus
Epiphanes: hence arose quarrels between the pontifical families,
and out of those sprung factions, which Antiochus Epiphanes was
desirous to turn to his own account, by the introduction of Grecian
institutions among the Jews, in order thereby to promote the
subjection of that people, now raised by its privileges almost to
the rank of a state within that of Syria. Deposition of the high
priest, Onias III. 175; his brother Jason having obtained the
mitre by purchase, and the introduction of Grecian customs:
Jason, however, was in his turn supplanted by his brother Mene[Pg 309]laus,
172. During the civil war arising out of these events, Antiochus
Epiphanes, at that time conqueror in Egypt, (see above,
p. 241.) takes possession of Jerusalem, 170, being provoked by
the behaviour of the Jews to Menelaus, the high priest of his own
appointment: the consequent oppression of the Jews, who now
were to be Hellenized by main force, soon occasioned the rise
under the Maccabees.

Third period under the Maccabees, 167&mdash;39. Commencement
of the rebellion against Antiochus IV. brought about by the
priest Mattathias, 167, who was almost immediately succeeded,
166&mdash;161, by his son Judas Maccab&aelig;us. Supported by the
fanaticism of his party, Judas defeats in several battles the generals
of Antiochus, who was absent in Upper Asia, where he died,
164; the Jewish leader is even said to have been favoured by
Rome. The primary object of the insurrection was not, however,
political independence; they fought only for religious freedom.
Under Antiochus V. the sedition continued successful, both
against the Syrian king and the high priest Alcimus, his creature,
163; Judas having died soon after his defeat by Demetrius I.
was succeeded by his brother Jonathan, 161&mdash;143. The death
of the high priest, Alcimus, 160, opened the path of Jonathan to
that office, which he received in the ensuing war between Demetrius
I. and Alexander Balas, 143, (see above, p. 244, 245.) both
rivals courting his alliance: Jonathan sided with Balas, and consequently,
from being merely the leader of a party, came to be
head of the nation, which still, nevertheless, continued to pay
tribute to the kings. Notwithstanding the favour he had shown
to Balas, after the overthrow of that pretender, he was confirmed
in his dignity by Demetrius I. 145; to whose assistance he
marched at the subsequent great revolt in Antioch. Jonathan
however, in 144, passed over to the side of the usurper, Antiochus,
the son of Balas, (see above, p. 245.) and was by embassy
presented with the friendship of the Romans in the same year,
but by the treachery of Tryphon was taken and put to death,
143. His brother and successor, Simon, 143&mdash;135, having declared
against Tryphon, was by Demetrius II. not only confirmed
in his dignity, but excused from paying tribute; he likewise received
the title of prince, (ethnarch;) and appears to have struck
coins. After the capture of Demetrius, Antiochus Sidetes allowed
Simon to remain in possession of those privileges so long as he
stood in need of his assistance against Tryphon; but after the[Pg 310]
death of that usurper, he caused him, 130, to be attacked by
Cendeb&aelig;us, who was defeated by the sons of Simon. Simon
having been murdered by his son-in-law, Ptolem&aelig;us, who aspired
to the government, 135, was succeeded by his son, John Hyrcanus,
135&mdash;107, who was compelled again to acknowledge submission
to Antiochus Sidetes; but after the defeat and death of
that prince by the Parthians, 130, he asserted his entire independence.
The deep decline of the Syrian kingdom, the constant
civil wars by which it was distracted, and the renewed league
with the Romans, not only enabled Hyrcanus easily to maintain
his independence, but likewise to increase his territory, by the
conquest of the Samaritans and Idum&aelig;ans. But with him ended
the heroic line. Scarcely was he delivered from foreign oppression,
when domestic broils arose; the Pharisees and Sadducees
had hitherto been mere religious sects, but were converted into
political factions by Hyrcanus, who, offended with the Pharisees,
probably in consequence of their wish to separate the pontifical
and princely offices, went over to the Sadducees; the former sect,
the orthodox, were as usual supported by the many; the latter,
the innovators, in consequence of the laxity of their principles,
were favoured by the wealthy. Hyrcanus's eldest son, the cruel
Aristobulus, 107, assumed the royal title, but soon after dying,
106, was succeeded by his younger brother, Alexander Jann&aelig;us,
106&mdash;79. His reign was an almost unbroken series of insignificant
wars with his neighbours, this prince wishing to play the
conqueror; and having likewise had the imprudence to irritate
the powerful party of the Pharisees, these made him the object
of public insult, and excited a tumult, 92, which was followed
by a bloody civil war which lasted six years. Jann&aelig;us, it is
true, maintained himself during the struggle; but the opposite
party was so far from being annihilated, that, at his death, when
passing over his sons, the feeble Hyrcanus (who possessed the
pontifical dignity) and the ambitious Aristobulus, he bequeathed
the crown to his widow Alexandra, it was with the understanding
that she should join the party of the Pharisees: during her reign,
therefore, 79&mdash;71, the Pharisees held the reins of government,
and left her only the name. Provoked at this, Aristobulus,
shortly before the death of the queen, endeavoured to obtain
possession of the throne, and ultimately obtained his ends, notwithstanding
Alexandra nominated Hyrcanus to be her successor.
Hyrcanus, at the instigation of his confidant, the Idum&aelig;an Anti[Pg 311]pater,
who was the progenitor of the Herodians, and assisted by
the Arabian prince Aretas, waged war against his brother, 65, and
shut him up in Jerusalem: but the Romans were arbitrators,
and Pompey, then all-powerful in Asia, decided for Hyrcanus,
64; the party of Aristobulus, however, refusing to accede, the
Roman general took possession of Jerusalem; made Hyrcanus
high priest and prince, under condition that he should pay tribute;
and took as prisoners to Rome Aristobulus and his sons,
who, however, subsequently escaped and caused great disturbances.
The Jewish state being now dependent on Rome, remained
so, and the yoke was confirmed by the policy of Antipater
and his sons, who followed the general maxim of entire devotion
to Rome, in order thereby to succeed in wholly removing the
reigning family. As early as 48, Antipater was appointed procurator
of Judea by C&aelig;sar, whom he had supported at Alexandria,
and his second son Herod, governor in Galilee, soon became sufficiently
powerful to threaten Hyrcanus and the sanhedrim, 45.
He gained the favour of Antony, and thus maintained himself
amid the tempests which, after the assassination of C&aelig;sar, 44,
shook the Roman world, powerful as the party opposed to him
were: that party, however, at last, in lieu of the ill-fated Hyrcanus,
the only surviving son of Aristobulus, placed Antigonus at
their head, and, assisted by the Parthians, then flourishing in
power, seated him on the throne, 39. Herod having fled to
Rome, not only met with a gracious reception at the hands of the
triumviri, but was by them appointed king.

Fourth period under the Herodians, B. C. 39 to A. D. 70.
Herod the Great, B. C. 39 to A. D. 1. put himself in possession
of Jerusalem and all Jud&aelig;a, B. C. 37, and confirmed his power
by marrying Mariamne of the house of the Maccabees. Notwithstanding
his severity shown to the party of Antigonus, and
the house of the Maccabees, the total extinction of which Herod
deemed necessary for his own safety; yet so greatly did the
wasted country stand in need of peace, that for that very reason
his reign may be said to have been a happy one. Availing himself
of the liberality of Augustus, whose favour he contrived to
obtain after the defeat of Anthony, B. C. 31, Herod gradually
increased the extent of his kingdom, which at last comprised
Jud&aelig;a, Samaria, Galilee, and beyond the Jordan, Per&aelig;a, Itur&aelig;a,
and Trachonitis, (that is to say, the whole of Palestine,) together
with Idum&aelig;a; from these countries he derived his income with[Pg 312]out
being obliged to pay any tribute. The deference consequently
shown by Herod to Rome, was but the effect of a natural policy,
and his conduct in that respect could be objected to him only by
bigoted Jews. To his whole family, rather than to himself individually,
are to be attributed the executions which took place
among its members; happy had it been if the sword had smitten
none but the guilty and spared the innocent. In the last year
but one of his reign is placed the birth of Christ (according to
the usually adopted computation, made in the sixth century by
Dionysius Exiguus. But the more accurate calculations of modern
chronologists show that the real date of the Saviour's birth was
probably four years earlier).&mdash;According to his will, with some
few alterations made by Augustus, his kingdom was divided
among his three surviving sons; Archelaus, as ethnarch, receiving
the greater moiety, Jud&aelig;a, Samaria, and Idum&aelig;a; the two
others, as tetrarchs, Philip a part of Galilee and Trachonitis, Antipas
the other part of Galilee, and Per&aelig;a, together with Itur&aelig;a;
subsequently to which division, the various parts did not, in consequence,
all share the same fate.&mdash;Archelaus, by misgovernment,
soon lost his portion, A. D. 6; Jud&aelig;a and Samaria were
consequently annexed as a Roman province to Syria, and placed
under procurators subordinate to the Syrian governors: among
these procurators, the most famous is Pontius Pilate, about A. D.
27&mdash;36, under whom the founder of our religion appeared and
suffered, not as a political&mdash;although accused of being so&mdash;but as
a moral reformer. On the other hand, Philip retained his tetrarchy
until the day of his death, A. D. 34, when his country
had the same lot with Jud&aelig;a and Samaria. Soon after, that is
to say, in A. D. 37, it was, however, given by Caligula, with the
title of king, to Agrippa, (grandson of Herod by Aristobulus,) as
a recompense for his attachment to the family of Germanicus;
and when Antipas, who wished to procure a similar favour for
himself but instead of it, was deposed, 39, Agrippa received his
tetrarchy also, 40, and soon afterwards, by the possession of the
territory which had belonged to Archelaus, became master of the
whole of Palestine. Agrippa having died in A. D. 44, the whole
country being appended to Syria, became a Roman province, and
received procurators, although Chalcis, 49, and subsequently also,
53, Philip's tetrarchy, were restored as a kingdom to his son
Agrippa II. d. 90. The oppression of the procurators, and of
Gessius Florus in particular, who obtained the office, A. D. 64,
[Pg 313]
excited the Jews to rebellion, which, 70, ended in the capture
and destruction of their city and temple by Titus. The spread
of the Jews over the whole civilized world of that time, although
previously commenced, was by this event still further increased;
and at the same time the extension of Christianity was prepared
and facilitated. Even after the conquest, Jerusalem not only
continued to exist as a city, but was also still considered by the
nation as a point of union; and the attempt, under Adrian, to
establish a Roman colony there, produced a fearful sedition.

FIFTH BOOK.
HISTORY OF THE ROMAN STATE.

[Pg 314]
Introductory remarks on the Geography of Ancient Italy.


General
outline of
Italy.

Italy constitutes a peninsula, bounded on the
north by the Alps, on the west and south by the
Mediterranean, and on the east by the Adriatic
sea. Its greatest length from north to south is
600 geogr. miles; its greatest breadth, taken at
the foot of the Alps, is 320 geogr. miles; but that
of the peninsula, properly so called, is not more
than 120 geogr. miles. Superficial contents,
81,920 sq. geogr. miles. The principal mountain
range is that of the Apennines, which, diverging
occasionally to the west, or east, stretch
from north to south through Central and Lower
Italy. In the earlier times of Rome, these mountains
were covered with thick forests. Main
streams: the Padus (Po) and the Athesis, (Adige,)
both of which discharge their waters in the Adriatic;
and the Tiberis, (Tiber,) which falls into
the Mediterranean. The soil, particularly in the
plains, is one of the most fertile in Europe; on
the other hand, many of the mountain tracts
admit but of little cultivation. In that period
when the Mediterranean was the grand theatre
of trade, Italy, by her situation, seemed destined
to become the principal mart of Europe; but she[Pg 315]
never in ancient times availed herself sufficiently
of this advantage.

Divisions
of Italy.

It is divided into Upper Italy, from the Alps to
the small rivers of Rubicon and Macra; (this
part, however, of Italy, until presented with the
right of citizenship under C&aelig;sar, was, according
to the Roman political geography, considered as
a province;) into Central Italy, from the Rubicon
and the Macra down to the Silarus and Frento;
and into Lower Italy from those rivers to the
southern land's end.


I. Upper Italy comprises the two countries, Gallia Cisalpina
and Liguria.

Cisalpine
Gaul.

1. Gallia Cisalpina, or Togata, in contradistinction
to Gallia Transalpina. It bears the name
of Gallia, in consequence of being for the most
part occupied by Gallic races. This country is
one continuous plain, divided by the Padus into
two parts, the northernmost of which is therefore
denominated Gallia Transpadana, (inhabited by
the Taurini, Insubres, and Cenomani,) while the
southern part (inhabited by the Boii, Senones,
and Lingones) is known by the name of Gallia
Cispadana. Various streams contribute to swell
the Padus; from the north the Duria, (Durance,)
the Ticinus, (Tessino,) the Addua, (Adda,) the
Ollius, (Oglio,) the Mintius, (Minzio,) and several
less important rivers; from the south, the Tanarus,
(Tanaro,) the Trebia, etc. The Athesis,
(Adige,) the Plavis, (Piave,) and a number of
smaller mountain streams, roll their waters directly
into the Adriatic.[Pg 316]

The cities in Gallia Cisalpina were, generally
speaking, Roman colonies; and most of them
have preserved to this day their ancient names.
Among these are reckoned in Gallia Transpadana,
principally, Tergeste, Aquileia, Patavium, (Padua,)
Vincentia, Verona, all east of the Athesis;
Mantua, Cremona, Brixia, (Brescia,) Mediolanum,
(Milan,) Ticinum, (Pavia,) and Augusta
Taurinorum, (Turin,) all west of the Athesis. In
Gallia Cispadana we meet with Ravenna, Bononia,
(Bologna,) Mutina, (Modena,) Parma, Placentia,
(Piacenza). Several of the above places
received municipal rights from the Romans.

Liguria.

2. Liguria. This country deduced its name
from the Ligures, one of the old Italic tribes: it
extended from the river Varus, by which it was
divided from Gallia Transalpina, down to the
river Macra; northward it extended to the Padus,
and comprised the modern territory of Genoa.&mdash;Cities:
Genua, an extremely ancient place; Nic&aelig;a,
(Nice,) a colony of Massilia; and Asta,
(Asti.)


II. Central Italy comprises six countries; Etruria, Latium,
and Campania on the west; Umbria, Picenum,
and Samnium on the east.

Etruria.

1. Etruria, Tuscia, or Tyrrhenia, was bounded
north by the Macra, which divided it from Liguria;
south and east by the Tiberis, which separated
it from Latium and Umbria. Main river,
the Arnus, (Arno). It is for the most part a
mountainous country; the seashore only is level.
This country derives its name from the Etrusci,[Pg 317]
a very ancient people, composed, it is probable,
of an amalgamation of several races, and even
some early Grecian colonies, to which latter they
were indebted, not indeed for all their arts, but
for that of writing; to commerce and navigation
the Etrusci were indebted for their opulence
and consequent splendour. Cities: between the
Macra and Arnus, Pis&aelig;, (Pisa,) Florentia, F&aelig;sul&aelig;;
between the Arnus and Tiberis, Volaterr&aelig;,
(Volterra,) Volsinii, (Bolsena,) on the Lacus Volsiniensis,
(Lago di Bolsena,) Clusium, (Chiusi,)
Arretium, (Arrezzo,) Cortona, Perusia, (Perugia,)
in the neighbourhood of which is the Lacus Thrasimenus,
(Lago di Perugia,) Falerii, (Falari,) and
the wealthy city of Veii. Each of the above
twelve cities had its own individual ruler, lucumo;
although frequent associations were formed among
them, yet no firm and lasting bond seems to have
united the nation into one.

Latium.

2. Latium, properly the residence of the Latini,
from the Tiberis north, to the promontory of Circeii,
south; hence that country was likewise denominated
Latium Vetus. Subsequently, under
the name of Latium was likewise reckoned the
country from Circeii, down to the river Liris,
(Latium Novum;) so that the boundaries came to
be, north, the Tiberis, south, the Liris: the seat
of the Latins, properly speaking, was in the fruitful
plain extending from the Tiber to Circeii;
around them, however, dwelt various small tribes,
some eastward, in the Apennines, such as the
Hernici, Sabini, &AElig;qui, and Marsi; others southward,
such as the Volsci, Rutuli, and Aurunci.&mdash;Rivers:
the Anio (Teverone) and Allia, which[Pg 318]
fall into the Tiber, and the Liris, (Garigliano,)
which empties itself into the Mediterranean. Cities
in Latium Vetus: Rome, Tibur, Tusculum,
Alba Longa, Ostia, Lavinium, Antium, Gabii, Velitr&aelig;,
the capital of the Volsci, and several smaller
places. In Latium Novum: Fundi, Terracina,
or Anxur, Arpinum, Minturn&aelig;, Formi&aelig;.

Campania.

3. Campania. The country lying between the
Liris, north, and the Silarus, south. One of the
most fruitful plains in the world, but at the same
time greatly exposed to volcanic eruptions. Rivers:
the Liris, the Vulturnus, (Voltorno,) the
Silarus, (Selo). Mountain: Vesuvius. Campania
derived its name from the race of the Campani.
Cities: Capua the principal one; and also Linternum,
Cum&aelig;, Neapolis, Herculaneum, Pompeii,
Stabi&aelig;, Nola, Surrentum, Salernum, etc.


The three eastern countries of Central Italy are as follows:

Umbria.

1. Umbria. It is bounded, north, by the river
Rubico, south, by the river &AElig;sis, (Gesano,) dividing
it from Picenum, and by the Nar, (Nera,) dividing
it from the Sabine territory. It is for the
most part plain. The Umbrian race had in early
times spread over a much larger portion of Italy.
Cities: Ariminium, (Rimini,) Spoletium, (Spoleto,)
Narnia, (Narni,) and Ocriculum, (Otriculi.)

Picenum.

2. Picenum. Bounded, north, by the &AElig;sis,
south, by the Atarnus, (Pescara.) The people are
called Picentes. This country consists in a fertile
plain. Cities: Ancona and Asculum Picenum,
(Ascoli.)[Pg 319]

Samnium.

3. Samnium, the name of a mountain tract extending
from the Atarnus, north, to the Frento,
south; although that country reckoned among its
inhabitants, not only the rude and powerful Samnites,
but also several less numerous races; for
instance, the Marrucini and Peligni in the north,
the Frentani in the east, and the Hirpini in the
south. Rivers: the Sagrus and the Tifernus.
Cities: Allif&aelig;, Beneventum, and Caudium.


III. Lower Italy, or Magna Grecia, comprised four countries;
Lucania and Bruttium on the western side, Apulia
and Calabria on the eastern.

Lucania.

1. Lucania. Boundaries: north, the Silarus,
south, the Laus. For the most part a mountain
tract. It derived its name from the race of the
Lucani, a branch of the Ausones, or chief nation
of Lower Italy. Cities: P&aelig;stum, or Posidonia,
still renowned for its ruins, and Helia, or Velia.

Bruttium.

2.  Bruttium, (the modern Calabria,) or the
western tongue of land from the river Laus to the
southern land's end at Rhegium. The river
Brandanus constitutes the eastern frontier. A
mountainous country, deriving its name from the
Bruttii, (a half savage branch of the Ausones,)
who dwelt in the mountains, while the seashores
were occupied by Grecian settlements. Cities:
Consentia, (Cosenza,) Pandosia, Mamertum, and
Petilia. (Concerning the Greek colonies see
above p. 155.)

Apulia.

3.  Apulia.  The country ranging along the
eastern coast, from the river Frento to the commencement
of the eastern tongue of land; an ex[Pg 320]tremely
fertile plain, and particularly adapted to
grazing cattle. Rivers: the Aufidus (Ofanto) and
the Cerbalus. This country is divided into two
parts by the Aufidus, the northern called Apulia
Daunia, the southern called Apulia Peucetia. Cities:
in Apulia Daunia; Sipontum and Luceria:
in Apulia Peucetia; Barium, Cann&aelig;, and Venusia.

Calabria.

4. Calabria or Messapia, the smaller eastern
tongue of land, which terminates in the promontory
of Iapygium. Cities: Brundusium (Brindisi)
and Callipolis (Gallipoli). Concerning Tarentum
and other Grecian colonies, see above, p. 155.

Three large islands are likewise reckoned as
appertaining to Italy: they are Sicily, Sardinia,
and Corsica. According to the political geography
of the Romans they were, however, considered
as provinces. Although the above islands
were, along the coast, occupied by aliens, the aboriginals,
under their own kings, maintained a
footing in the inland parts; among these the Siculi,
said to have migrated from Italy, were the
most celebrated; they remained in Sicily, and
gave their name to the whole island. Concerning
the cities, the more important of which were,
some of Ph&#339;nician, but the most part of Grecian,
origin, see above, p. 30, and p. 155, sqq.




[Pg 321]
FIRST PERIOD.


From the foundation of Rome to the conquest of Italy and
the commencement of the wars with Carthage, B. C. 754&mdash;264,
or A. U. C. 1&mdash;490.


Sources. The most copious author, and, if we except his
system of deducing everything connected with Rome from
Greece, the most critical of all those who have written on the
earlier history of Rome and Italy, is Dionysius Halicarnassensis,
in his Arch&aelig;ologia: of this work only the first eleven books,
reaching down to the year 443, have been preserved; to these,
however, must be added the fragments of the nine following
books, xii&mdash;xx. discovered in 1816, and published by the Abbate
Mai of Milan. Next to Dionysius is Livy, who as far as lib. iv,
c. 18, is our main authority, till B. C. 292. Of the Lives of
Plutarch the following belong to this period, Romulus, Numa,
Coriolanus, Poplicola and Camillus; which for the knowledge
and criticism they display, are perhaps more important even than
Livy and Dionysius, see A. H. L. Heeren, De fontibus et auctoritate
vitarum Plutarchi, inserted in Comment Recentiores Soc.
Scient. Gott. Comment. I. II. Gr&aelig;ci, III. IV. Romani; reprinted
also as an appendix to the editions of Plutarch by Reiske
and Hutten, Gottingen, 1821, ap. Dieterich. The sources of the
most ancient Roman history were extremely various in kind.
The traditions of the Fathers were preserved in historical ballads;
(no mention is ever made of any grand epic poem;) and in this
sense there existed a bardic history; by no means, however,
wholly poetic, for even the traditions of Numa's Institutes are
without the characteristics of poetry. The art of writing was in
Italy of earlier origin than the city of Rome; how far, consequently,
the public annals, such as the Libri Pontificum, extended
back in early time remains undetermined. Several of
the memorials are, beyond a doubt, mere family records, whether
preserved by vocal tradition or in written documents. To the
above must be added monuments, not only buildings and works
of arts, but also treaties engraved on tables; of which, nevertheless,
too little use seems to have been made. The Romans having
learnt the art of writing from the Greeks, their history was as[Pg 322]
frequently written in Greek as in Latin; and that not only by
Greeks, such as, in the first place, Diocles of Peparethus, but
likewise by Romans, such as Fabius Pictor, at an early period.
From these last sources Dionysius and Livy compiled. The
more ancient Roman history given by these authorities rests,
therefore, in part, but by no means entirely, on tradition and
poetry; still further amplified by the rhetoric style, that of the
Greeks more especially. At what epoch the Roman history lays
aside the poetic character can hardly be determined with certainty;
it may be traced even in some parts of the period extending
from the expulsion of the kings to the conquest by the
Gauls.&mdash;For the purposes of chronology, great importance attaches
to the fasti Romani, contained partly in inscriptions, (fasti
Capitolini,) partly in manuscripts. They have been collected
and restored by Pighius, Noris Sigonius, etc. in Gr&aelig;vii, Thes.
A. R. vol. xi.; likewise in Almeloveen, Fast. Rom. I. II.
Amstel. 1705, etc.

The Roman history has been copiously treated of by the moderns
in many works besides those on universal ancient history
before enumerated, (p. 2.). We shall mention only the more important.

has been continued and terminated by Crevier. Although the
critical historian might suggest much that is wanting in this
work, it nevertheless contributed to advance the study.

Ed. Ferguson, The History of the Progress and Termination
of the Roman Republic. London, 1783, 4to. On the whole,
the best work on the history of the Roman republic; it has superceded
the earlier work of Goldsmith.

the glory of ancient Rome, had better not read this
work.

[Pg 323]

Rather criticism than history; the author seems to be perpetually
endeavouring to overthrow all that has hitherto been admitted.
The spirit of acuteness is not always that of truth; and
men do not so lightly assent to the existence of a constitution
which not only is contrary to the broad view of antiquity&mdash;inferences
drawn from some insulated passages not being sufficient to
overturn what is corroborated by all the others&mdash;but likewise, according
to the author's own avowal, stands opposed to all analogy
in history. But truth gains even where criticism is wrong; and
the value of some deep researches will not for that reason be
overlooked.&mdash;Consult on this subject:

General
characteristic
of Roman
history.

1. In certain respects, the history of Rome is
always that of one town, inasmuch as until the
period of the C&aelig;sars, the city continued mistress[Pg 324]
of her extensive territory. The main parts of the
internal constitution of Rome were formed during
this first period; which, considered in an historical
point of view, can hardly be said to be void
of interest. Whether every fundamental institution
had its origin precisely at the epoch to which
it is attributed, is a question of little importance;
it is sufficient to observe, that they certainly arose
in this period; and that the steps by which the
constitution was developed are, upon the whole,
determined beyond the possibility of a doubt.

Romans
of Latin
origin.

2. Exaggerated and embellished as the most
ancient traditions of the Romans respecting their
origin may be, they all agree in this, that the
Romans belonged to the race of the Latini, and
that their city was a colony of the neighbouring
Alba Longa. Long before this the custom seems
to have obtained with the Latini, of extending the
cultivation of their country by colonies.

The primitive history of Rome is as difficult to reduce to pure
historic truth as that of Athens, or any other city of antiquity;
this proceeds from its being principally founded on traditions,
handled by poets and rhetoricians, and likewise differing from
one another; as may be seen in Plutarch's Romulus. As the
knowledge of those traditions, such as they are found in Dionysius
and Livy, attaches to so many other subjects, it would be
improper to pass them over in silence; and that they contained
truths as well as poetic fictions is proved most evidently by the
political institutions of which they narrate the origin, and which
certainly reached back to those times. To attempt to draw a
line of demarcation between mythical and historic times would
be to mistake the real nature of mythology.

L. de Beaufort, Sur l'incertitude des cinq premiers si&egrave;cles de
l'histoire Romaine, nouv. &eacute;d. &agrave; la Haye, 1750, 2 vols. 8vo. Every
thing that can be said against the credibility of the primitive
Roman history has been developed by Beaufort with abundant,
and often with laboured, acuteness.[Pg 325]

Kings of
Rome.

3. During the first two hundred and forty-five
years subsequent to its foundation this city was
under the rule of governors, denominated kings;
these, however, were not hereditary, still less
were they invested with unlimited power, although
they exerted themselves to become both
perpetual and absolute. On the contrary, in this
period was framed a municipal constitution, demonstrative
of the existence, even at this early
date, of a considerable degree of political civilization;
in its principal parts this constitution was,
no doubt,&mdash;as in every colony,&mdash;copied from that
of the mother city. Its principal features were:
a. Establishment and internal organization of the
senate. b. Establishment and progress of the
patrician or hereditary nobility, which, supported
by the privilege of administering the sacred affairs,
and by the introduction of family names,
quickly formed, in opposition to the plebeians, a
political party ever growing in power, although
not, therefore, a mere sacerdotal caste. c. Organization
of the people (populus), and modes of
popular assembly (comitia), founded thereupon;
besides the original division according to heads
into tribus and curi&aelig;, another was subsequently
introduced according to property into classes and
centuri&aelig;, out of which, besides the more ancient
comitia curiata, arose the very artificially constructed
comitia centuriata. d. Religious institutions,
(religiones,) which being most closely connected
with the political constitution, formed a
state religion, by means of which everything in
the state was attached to determined forms, and
received a higher sanction. Nor must we omit
[Pg 326]e. the relations in private life established by law,
the clientship, marriage, and especially paternal
authority. In consequence of those domestic relations,
a spirit of subordination and discipline,
from the earliest times, pervaded the people; and
to that spirit the Romans were indebted for the
glory to which they attained.

Destruction
of Alba
Longa.

4. Notwithstanding many little wars with their
immediate neighbours the Sabines, &AElig;qui, and
Volsci, together with various cities of the Etrusci,
and even with the Latins themselves, Rome added
but little to her territory: nevertheless she took
the first step towards her aggrandizement; from
the time of the destruction of Alba Longa, she
aimed at being the head of the collected cities of
the Latins, and finally attained the object of her
ambition.

Line of kings. Romulus, 754&mdash;717. First establishment of
the colony; augmentation in the number of the citizens, produced
by the establishment of an asylum, and an union with
part of the Sabines. Numa Pompilius, d. 679. By representing
this prince as the founder of the religion of the Roman state,
that religion received the high sanction of antiquity. Tullus
Hostilius, d. 640. The conquest and destruction of Alba lays
the foundation of Roman supremacy in Latium. Ancus Martius,
d. 618. He extends the territory of Rome to the sea; the
foundation of the port of Ostia proves that Rome already applied
to navigation, the object of which was perhaps as yet rather
piracy than trade. Tarquinius Priscus, d. 578. A Grecian by
descent. Under his conduct Rome was already able to enter the
field against the confederate Etrusci. Servius Tullius, d. 534.
The most remarkable in the line of Roman kings. He placed
Rome at the head of the confederacy of the Latins, which he
confirmed by communia sacra. On his new division of the

deposition, and the consequent reformation of the government,
were however, properly speaking, brought about by the ambition
of the patricians.

5. The only direct consequence to the internal
constitution of Rome, proceeding from the abolition
of royalty was, that that power, undetermined
as it had been while in the hands of the kings,
was transferred to two consuls, annually elected.

new republic was engaged with the Etrusci and
Latins, contributed much to arouse the republican

establishment of annually elected presidents of the people

Rise of the
Roman
constitution.

6. The further development of the Roman constitution
in this period, hinges almost wholly on
the struggle between the new presidents of the
commons and the hereditary nobility; the tribunes,
instead of confining themselves to defend
the people from the oppression of the nobles, soon
began to act as aggressors, and in a short time
so widely overstepped their power, that there remained
no chance of putting an end to the struggle
but by a complete equalization of rights. A
long time elapsed ere this took place; the aristocracy
finding a very powerful support both in
the clientship and in the religion of the state,
operating under the shape of auspices.

Main facts of the contest: 1. In the trial of Coriolanus the
tribunes usurp the right of summoning some patricians before
the tribunal of the people.&mdash;Hence arise the comitia tributa;
that is to say, either mere assemblies of the commons, or assemblies
so organized that the commons had the preponderance.
This institution gave the tribunes a share in the legislation,
subsequently of such high importance, those officers being allowed
to lay proposals before the commons. 2. More equitable distribution
among the poorer classes of the lands conquered from the
neighbouring nations, (the most ancient leges agrari&aelig;,) suggested
by the ambitious attempts of Cassius, 486. 3. Extension of the
prerogatives of the comitia tributa, more especially in the election
of the tribunes, brought about by Volero, 472. 4. Attempts
at a legal limitation of the consular power by Terentillus, (lex
Terentilla,) 460, which, after a long struggle, at last leads to
the idea of one common written code, 452, which is likewise[Pg 329]
realized in spite of the opposition at first made by the patricians.

portion of Roman history.

Code of the
twelve tables.

7. The code of the twelve tables confirmed the
ancient institutions, and was in part completed by
the adoption of the laws of the Greek republics,
among which Athens in particular is mentioned,
whose counsels were requested by a special deputation.
In this, however, two faults were committed;
not only were the commissioners charged
with drawing up the laws elected from the patricians
alone, but they were likewise constituted
sole magistrates, with dictatorial power, (sine provocatione;)
whereby a path was opened to them
for an usurpation, which could be frustrated only
by a sedition of the people.

Duration of the power of the Decemviri, 451&mdash;447. The
doubts raised as to the deputation sent to Athens are not sufficient
to invalidate the authenticity of an event so circumstantially
detailed. Athens, under Pericles, was then at the head of
Greece; and, admitting the proposed design of consulting the
Greek laws, it was impossible that Athens should have been
passed over. And indeed, why should it be supposed, that a
state which fifty years before had signed a commercial treaty
with Carthage, and could not be unacquainted with the Grecian
colonies in Lower Italy, might not have sent an embassy into
Greece?

The yet remaining fragments of the code of the twelve tables
are collected and illustrated in Bachii Hist. Jurisprudenti&aelig; Roman&aelig;;
and in several other works.

Its enactments.

8. By the laws of the twelve tables the legal
relations of the citizens were the same for all; but
as that code seems to have contained very little[Pg 330]
in reference to any peculiar constitution of the
state, the government not only remained in the
hands of the aristocrats, who were in possession
of all offices, but the prohibition, according to the
new laws of marriage between patricians and plebeians,
appeared to have raised an insurmountable
barrier between the two classes. No wonder,
then, that the tribunes of the people should
have immediately renewed their attacks on the
patricians; particularly as the power of those popular
leaders was not only renewed, but even
augmented, as the only limit to their authority
was the necessity of their being unanimous in
their acts, while each had the right of a negative.

Besides the other laws made in favour of the people at the renewal
of the tribunicia potestas, 446, that which imported ut
quod tributim plebes jussisset, populum teneret, frequently renewed
in subsequent times, and meaning, in modern language,
that the citizens constituted themselves, must, it would appear,
have thrown the supreme power into the hands of the people;
did not the Roman history, like that of other free states, afford
examples enough of the little authority there is to infer from the
enactment of a law that it will be practically enforced.

Dissensions
between patricians
and
plebeians.

9. The main subjects of the new dissensions
between patricians and plebeians, excited by the
tribune Canuleius, were now the connubia patrum
cum plebe, and the exclusive participation of the
patricians in the consulship, of which the tribunes
demanded the abolition. The repeal of the former
law was obtained as early as 445, (lex Canuleia;)
the right of admission to the consulship was
not extended to the Plebeians, till after a struggle
annually renewed for eighty years; during which,
when, as usually was the case, the tribunes forbade
the military enrolment, recourse was had to
[Pg 331]a transfer of the consular power to the yearly
elected commanders of the legions; a place to
which plebeians were entitled to aspire, (tribuni
militum consulari potestate.)&mdash;Establishment of the
Censors.
office of CENSORS, designed at first for nothing
more than to regulate the taking of the census,
and invested with no higher authority than what
that required, but who soon after, by assuming
to themselves the censura morum, took rank
among the most important dignitaries of the
state.

Petty wars.

10. Meanwhile Rome was engaged in wars,
insignificant but almost uninterrupted, arising out
of the oppression, either real or imaginary, which
she exercised as head of the neighbouring federate
cities, (socii,) comprising not only those of the
Latins, but likewise, after the victory of lake Regillus,
those of the other nations: the cities embraced
every opportunity of asserting their independence,
and the consequent struggles must
have depopulated Rome, had not that evil been
diverted by the maxim of increasing the complement
of citizens by admitting the freedmen, and
not unfrequently even the conquered, to the enjoyment
of civic privileges. Little as these feuds,
abstractedly considered, deserve our attention,
they become of high interest, inasmuch as they
were not only the means by which the nation
was trained to war, but also led to the foundation
of that senatorial power, whose important
consequences will be exhibited hereafter.

Among these wars attention must be directed to the last,
that against Veii, the richest city in Etruria; the siege of that
place, which lasted very nearly ten years, 404&mdash;395, gave rise[Pg 332]
to the introduction among the Roman military of winter campaigning,
and of pay; thus, on the one hand, the prosecution of
wars more distant and protracted became possible, while on the
other the consequences must have been the levy of higher taxes,
(tributa).

Rome burnt
by the
Gauls.

11. Not long after, however, a tempest from the
north had nearly destroyed Rome. The Sennonian
Gauls, pressed out of northern Italy through
Etruria, possessed themselves of the city, the
capitol excepted, and reduced it to ashes; an
event which made so deep an impression on the
minds of the Romans, that few other occurrences
in their history have been more frequently the object
of traditional detail. Camillus, then the deliverer
of Rome, and in every respect one of the
chief heroes of that period, laid a double claim to
the gratitude of his native city, by overruling,
after his victory, the proposal of a general migration
to Veii.

Feuds revived.

12. Scarcely was Rome rebuilt ere the ancient
feuds revived, springing out of the poverty of the
citizens, produced by an increase of taxation consequent
on the establishment of military pay, and
by the introduction of gross usury. The tribunes,
Sextius and Licinius, by prolonging their term of
office to five years, had established their power;
while Licinius, by an agrarian law, decreeing that
no individual should hold more than five hundred
jugera of the national lands, had ensured the popular
favour; so that at last they succeeded in
A consul chosen from the commons.
obtaining, that one of the consuls should be chosen
from the commons; and although the nobility, by
the nomination of a pr&aelig;tor from their own body,
and of &aelig;diles curules, endeavoured to compensate[Pg 333]
for the sacrifice they were obliged to make, yet
the plebeians having once made good a claim to
the consulship, their participation in the other
magisterial offices, (the dictatorship, 353, the censorship,
348, the pr&aelig;torship, 334,) and even the
priesthood, (300,) quickly followed as a matter of
course. Thus at Rome the object of political
equality between commons and nobles was attained;
and although the difference between the
patrician and plebeian families still subsisted,
they soon ceased to form political parties.

A second commercial treaty entered into with Carthage, 345,
demonstrates that even at this time the navy of the Romans was
anything but contemptible; although its principal object as yet
was mere piracy. Roman squadrons of war however appear
more than once within the next forty years.

Samnite
war.

13. Far more important than any wars in which
Rome had hitherto been engaged, were those
soon about to commence with the Samnites. In
former contests the object of Rome had been to
establish her supremacy over her immediate
neighbours; but in these, during a protracted
contest of fifty years, she opened a way to the
subjugation of Italy, and laid the foundation of
her future greatness.

Commencement of the wars against the Samnites, the Campanians
having called the Romans to their assistance against that
nation, 343. These wars, carried on with vigorous exertion and
various success, lasted, with but short intermissions, till 290.
This is the true heroic age of Rome, ennobled by the patriotic
valour of Decius Mus, (father and son, both voluntary victims,)
Papirius Cursor, Q. Fabius Maximus, etc. The consequences of
this struggle were: a. The Romans learnt the art of mountain
warfare, and thereby for the first time acquired a peculiar system
of military tactics; not, however, till they had been, 321, obliged
to pass under the furcas Caudinas. b. Their relations were[Pg 334]
more firmly established with their neighbours the Latins and
Etrurians, by the complete conquest of the former, 340, and by
repeated victories over the latter, more especially in 308. c.
Great national federations having arisen in Italy, particularly
during the last period of the Samnite wars, the Romans entered
into connection with the more distant nations of the country;
with the Lucanians and Apulians, by the first league, 323, with
the Umbri, from the year 308; and although the nature of this
connection frequently varied, the different nations were perpetually
struggling for independence, and were consequently at enmity
with Rome. In this period, moreover, commenced the
practical illustration of the leading ideas of Rome upon the political
relations in which she placed the conquered with regard to
herself.

War against
the Tarentines,
who
are assisted
by Pyrrhus.

14. After the subjection of the Samnites, Rome,
wishing to confirm her dominion in Lower Italy,
was thereby, for the first time, entangled in war
with a foreign prince; the Tarentines, too feeble
to maintain alone their footing against the Romans,
called Pyrrhus of Epirus to their assistance.
He came, indeed, but not so much to further the
views of the Tarentines as to advance his own;
but even in victory, he learnt by experience that
the Macedonian tactics gave him but a slight preponderance,
which the Romans soon transferred
to their own side, exhibiting the truth of the principle,
that a good civic militia, sooner or later,
will always get the upper hand of mercenary
troops.

The idea of calling upon Pyrrhus for assistance was the more
natural, as the predecessor of that prince, Alexander I. (see
above p. 275.) had endeavoured, but without success, to effect
conquests in Lower Italy. In the first war with Pyrrhus, 280&mdash;278,
two battles were fought, the first at Pandosia, 280, the other
at Asculum, 279; in both of which Rome was unsuccessful.
But Pyrrhus, after crossing over into Sicily, 278, (see above, p.
173, 174.) once more returned into Italy, 275, when he was de[Pg 335]feated
by the Romans at Beneventum, and compelled to evacuate
Italy, leaving a garrison at Tarentum. That city, however, soon
afterwards, 272, fell into the hands of the Romans, whose dominion
was consequently extended to the extremity of Lower Italy.

Roman colonies.

15. The chief means to which, even from the
earliest times, the Romans had recourse for the
foundation of their dominion over the conquered,
and at the same time for the prevention of the too
great increase of the needy classes at Rome, was
the establishment of colonies of their own citizens,
which, being settled in the captured cities, served
likewise as garrisons. Each colony had its own
distinct internal constitution, modelled, for the
most part, upon that of the mother city itself;
hence to keep the colonies in perfect dependence
naturally became an object of Roman policy.
This colonial system of the Romans, necessarily
and spontaneously arising out of the rude custom
of bereaving the conquered of their lands and
liberty, assumed its main features in the Samnite
war, and gradually embraced the whole of Italy.
Closely connected with this system was the construction
of military highways, (vi&aelig; militares,) one
of which, the Appian Way, was constructed so
early as 312, and to this day remains a lasting
monument of the greatness of Rome at that
period.

Even at the time of Hannibal's invasion, the number of Roman
colonies amounted to 53: but several which had been settled
returned to the mother city.

Relations
between
Rome and
the Italian
nations.

16. But the relations existing between Rome
[Pg 336]and the Italian nations were extremely various in
kind. 1. A few cities and nations enjoyed the
full privileges of Roman citizenship; in some instances,
however, without the right of voting in
the comitia (municipia). 2. The privileges of the
colonies (jus coloniarum) were of a more restricted
nature; the colonists were indeed in possession
of their own civic government, but had no further
share whatever either in the comitia or magistracies
of Rome. The other inhabitants of Italy
were either federates (socii, f&#339;dere juncti) or subjects
(dedititii). The first (a) preserved their internal
form of government; but on the other hand
(b) were obliged to furnish tribute and auxiliary
troops (tributis et armis juvare rempublicam).
Their further relation with Rome depended upon
the terms of the league. The most advantageous
of these terms were 3. in favour of the Latins,
although each of their cities had its own separate
league (jus Latii;) as 4. the rest of the Italian
nations had their jus Italicum. On the other
hand, 5. the subjects, dedititii, were deprived of
their internal constitutions, and were governed
by Roman magistrates, (pr&aelig;fecti,) annually renewed.

C. Sigonius, De antiquo jure civium Romanorum; and his
treatise De antiquo jure Itali&aelig;, inserted both in his Opera and
in Gr&aelig;vii Thes. Ant. Rom. t. ii. contain the most learned researches
on the details of these relations.

The Roman
constitution
a democracy.

17. The internal constitution of Rome itself,
now completed, bore the character of a democracy,
inasmuch as equality of rights existed both
for nobles and commons. Yet this democracy was
modified by expedients so various and wonderful[Pg 337]&mdash;the
rights of the people, of the senate, of the
magistrates, fitted so nicely into each other, and
were so firmly supported by the national religion,
connecting every thing with determinate forms&mdash;that
there was no reason, at that time, to fear the
evils either of anarchy, or, what is much more
astonishing when we consider the warlike character
of the people, those of military despotism.

The rights of the people consisted in the legislative power, so
far as fundamental national principles were concerned, and in the
election of the magistrates. The distinction between the comitia
tributa (as independent of the senate) and the comitia centuriata
(as dependent on the senate) still existed as to form, but
had lost all its importance, the difference between patricians and
plebeians being now merely nominal, and the establishment of
the tribus urban&aelig;, 303, excluding the too great influence of the
people (forensis factio) upon the comitia tributa. The rights of
the senate consisted in administering and debating all transitory
national affairs, whether foreign relations, (war and peace only
excepted, in which the consent of the people was requisite,)
financial concerns, or matters regarding domestic peace and security.
But the manner in which the senate was supplied must
have made it the first political body at that time in the world.
The rights and rank of magistrates were founded on their greater
or lesser auspicia, no public affair being entered upon except
auspicato. Consequently he only who was in possession of the
former could hold the highest civic and military power; (imperium
civile et militare; suis auspiciis rem gerere;) as dictator,
consul, pr&aelig;tor; such was not the case with those who had only
the lesser auspicia. The union of civil and military power in
the person of the same individual was not without its inconveniences,
but military despotism was in some measure guarded
against by the prohibition of any magistrate possessing military
command within Rome itself. We must not dismiss this subject
without observing, that as the Roman constitution arose merely
out of practice, there never having been any completely written
charter, we cannot expect that all the details should be clearly
ascertained; to attempt, therefore, in default of such authority,
to describe all the minuti&aelig; would be the surest way to fall into
error.

Roman antiquities, we shall mention:

promises at least as much as it performs. Of those which profess
to treat of Roman antiquities in general, none have yet risen
above mediocrity. Jurisprudence, however, has been much more
successfully handled. We cite the two following excellent compendiums:

SECOND PERIOD.

From the commencement of the war with Carthage to the
rise of the civil broils under the Gracchi, B. C. 264&mdash;134.
Year of Rome, 490&mdash;620.


Sources. The principal writer for this highly interesting
period, in which was laid the foundation of the universal dominion
of Rome, is Polybius as far as the year 146, not only in the
complete books preserved to us, which come down to 216, but
also in the fragments. He is frequently followed by Livy, lib.
xxi&mdash;xlv. 218&mdash;166. Appian, who comes next, does not confine
himself merely to the history of the war; Florus gives us only an
abridgement. The lives of Plutarch which relate to this portion
of history, are Fabius Maximus, P. &AElig;milius, Marcellus,
M. Cato, and Flaminius.

Of modern writers we dare only mention one:&mdash;and who is
worthy to be ranked beside him?

Montesquieu, Considerations sur les causes de la grandeur
et de la d&eacute;cadence des Romains.


1. The political division of Italy laid the foundation
for the dominion of Rome in that country;
the want of union and political relations in the
world paved the way to her universal empire.
The first step cost her much, the succeeding followed

or subjected: but the vast extent of this
[Pg 340]struggle, the important consequences which followed,
together with the wonderful exertions
made, and the great men engaged on both sides,
gave it an interest which cannot be found in that

of any other nations. Though the power and resources
of both states were nearly equal in appearance,
they were widely different in quality
and circumstances. Carthage, besides her dominion
over the seas, had also a better furnished
treasury, by which she was enabled to enlist into
her service as many mercenaries as she pleased:
Rome, on the contrary, strong in herself, had all
the advantages possessed by a nation of warriors
over one partly commercial, partly military.

The first
war of twenty-three
years, B. C.
264&mdash;241.

2. The first war of twenty-three years between
the two republics, arose from very slight causes:
it soon, however, became a struggle for the possession
of Sicily, which in the end naturally extended
itself to the dominion of the sea. Rome,
by the aid of her newly-built fleet, having obtained
for some time this power, was enabled to
attack Africa, and succeeded in driving the Carthaginians
from Sicily.

The occupation of Messina by the Romans, 264, gave rise to
this war. The defection of Hiero king of Syracuse from the
side of Carthage, and his joining the Romans, first gave the latter
the idea of expelling the Carthaginians from the island. The
victory near Agrigentum, and capture of that city in 262, seemed
to facilitate the execution of this project: it also convinced the
Romans of the necessity of their having a naval power. We
shall the less wonder at their forming a fleet in Italy, where wood
was then plentiful, if we remember their previous experience in
naval affairs; these were not the first vessels of war which they
constructed, but only the first large ones which they built upon
a Carthaginian model. The first naval victory of the Romans
under Duilius, by the aid of grappling machines, 260. The[Pg 341]
project then conceived of carrying the war into Africa was one of
the great ideas of the Romans, and from that time it became a
ruling maxim of the state, to attack the enemy in his own territory.
The second and very remarkable naval victory of the Romans,
257, opened the way for them to Africa, and shows their
naval tactics in a very brilliant light: but the unfortunate issue
of their expedition to Africa, restored the equilibrium; and the
struggle for the dominion of the sea became the more obstinate,
as success did not altogether favour one party. The result of the
contest appears to have turned upon the possession of the eastern
promontories of Sicily, Drepanum, and Lilyb&aelig;um, which were
in a manner the bulwarks of the Carthaginians, and seemed impregnable
since Hamilcar Barca had taken the command of them,
247. The last naval victory of the Romans, however, under the
consul Lutatius, 241, having cut off the communication between
Sicily and Carthage, and the finances of both parties being completely
exhausted, a peace was concluded upon the conditions:
1. That the Carthaginians should evacuate Sicily and the small
islands adjacent. 2. That they should pay to Rome, by instalments
in ten years, for the expenses she had been at in carrying
on the war, the sum of 2,200 talents. 3. That they should not
make war against Hiero king of Syracuse.

3. The issue of this war placed the political
connections of Rome in a new situation, and necessarily
extended her influence abroad. The
length of the war and the manner of its conclusion
had, moreover, inspired a national hatred,
such as is only found in republics; the conviction
also that they could not remain independent of
one another, must have become much more striking,
as the points of contact had greatly increased
since the beginning of the war. Who does not
know the arrogance of a republic after the first
essay of her power has been crowned with success!
Rome gave a striking example of this by
her invasion of Sardinia in the midst of peace.
Effect of these successes on the constitution.
These successes had also a sensible effect on the
[Pg 342]Roman constitution. For although in appearance
its form was not in the least changed, yet the
power of the senate now acquired that preponderance
which the ruling authority of a republic
never fails to do after long and successful wars.

Origin and nature of the governments of the first Roman provinces,
in part of Sicily and in Sardinia.

Chastisement
of the
Illyrian pirates.

4. An opportunity was soon afforded the Romans,
in the Adriatic sea, of making use of their
superior naval power, in chastising the pirates of
Illyria under their queen Teuta. By effecting
this, they not only secured their authority over
that sea, but at the same time formed their first
political relations with the Grecian states; relations
which soon afterwards became of great importance.

Commencement of the first Illyrian war, 230, which ended with
the subjugation of Teuta, 226. The war, however, again broke out,
222, against Demetrius of Pharus, who conceived himself inadequately
rewarded by Rome for the services he had rendered her
in the preceding war. The Romans found him a much more
dangerous adversary than had been expected, even after his expulsion
and flight to Philip, 220, (see above, p. 282.) Throughout
this war, Rome appeared as the deliverer of the Grecian
states, which had suffered extremely from the plunder of these
freebooters; Corcyra, Apollonia, and other cities placed themselves
formally under her protection, while the Ach&aelig;ans, &AElig;tolians,
and Athenians vied with each other in showing their gratitude.

Relations
with
Greece.

5. In the mean time, while Carthage endeavoured
to make up for the loss of Sicily and Sardinia by
extending her Spanish dominions, which the
jealousy of Rome restrained her from carrying
beyond the Ebro (p. 84.), Rome herself had a
new war to maintain against her northern neigh[Pg 343]bours
the Gauls, which ended after a violent contest
with the establishment of her authority over
the north of Italy.

From the first Gallic war to the burning of Rome, 390, the
Gauls had repeated their attacks in 360 and 348, even to the
conclusion of the peace in 336. But in the latter part of the
Samnite war, a formidable confederacy having taken place among
the Italian tribes, some of the Gauls enlisted as mercenaries in
the service of the Etruscans, while others allied themselves to
the Samnites. This led them to take part in these wars in 306,
302, and 292, until they were obliged, together with the Etruscans,
to sue for peace in 284, before which time the Romans had
sent a colony into their country, near Sena. This peace lasted
till 238, when it was disturbed by the incursion of the transalpine
Gauls; without, however, their coming to any war with Rome.
But in 232, the proposition of Flaminius the tribune, (lex Flaminia),
to divide the lands conquered from the Senones, became
the cause of new disturbances. Upon this occasion, the Gauls
entered into an alliance with their transalpine countrymen, the
G&aelig;sates on the Rhone, who had been accustomed to engage as
mercenaries. These having crossed the Alps, the dreadful war
of six years (226&mdash;220) began, in which, after defeating the
Gauls near Clusium, 225, the Romans pursued them into their
own territory, and encamped upon the Po, 223. The Gauls
having been again completely overthrown by Marcellus, were
obliged to sue for peace; when the Roman colonies of Placentia
and Cremona were established. The number of men capable of
bearing arms in all Italy subject to the Romans during this war
amounted to 800,000.

Hannibal
takes the
command
in Spain,


6. Before this storm was totally appeased, in
which it is probable that Carthaginian policy was
not altogether inactive, Hannibal had obtained the
chief command in Spain. From the reproach of
having first begun the war, he and his party
cannot be cleared; Rome, in the situation she
then was, could hardly desire it; he however
who strikes the first blow is not always the real
aggressor. The plan of Hannibal was the de[Pg 344]struction
of Rome; and by making Italy the
and makes Italy the seat of war.
principal seat of the war, he necessarily turned
the scale in his favour; because Rome, obliged
to defend herself, left to him all the advantages
of attack. The preparations she made for defence,
show that it was not believed possible he
could execute his enterprise by the route which
he took.

The history of this war, 218&mdash;201, of which no later transaction
has been able to destroy the interest, is divided into three
parts: the history of the war in Italy; the contemporary war in
Spain; and from 203, the war in Africa. Hannibal's invasion
of Italy in the autumn, 218&mdash;engagement near the river Ticinus
and the battle of Trebia, in the same year. Battle near the lake
Thrasymenus in the spring, 217. Seat of the war transferred
to Lower Italy, and the defensive system of the dictator Fabius
until the end of the year. Battle of Cann&aelig;, 216, followed by
the conquest of Capua and the subjection of the greater part of
Lower Italy. The defensive mode of warfare afterwards adopted
by the Carthaginian, arose partly from his desire to form a junction
with his brother Asdrubal and the Spanish army, and partly
from his expectation of foreign support by means of alliances,
with Syracuse, after the death of Hiero, 215, and with Philip of
Macedon, 216. These hopes, however, were frustrated by the
Romans.&mdash;Syracuse was besieged and taken, 214&mdash;212, (see
above, p. 174.) and Philip kept employed in Greece, (see above,
p. 282.) In addition to this, the Romans retook Capua, notwithstanding
the audacious march of Hannibal towards Rome,
211, and he had now no succour left except the reinforcement
which Asdrubal was bringing from Spain. The latter, however,
was attacked immediately upon his arrival in Italy, near Sena,
by the consuls Nero and Livius, and left dead on the field, 207.
From this time the war in Italy became only of secondary importance,
as Hannibal was obliged to act on the defensive in
Bruttium.

The Course of Hannibal over the Alps ascertained, by J.
Whittaker. London, 1794, 2 vols. 8vo. The author endeavours
to prove that the passage of Hannibal was over the great
St. Bernard, and criticises the opinions of other writers.
[Pg 345]
[We may likewise mention the learned treatise:&mdash;

A Dissertation on the Passage of Hannibal over the Alps.
By H. L. Wickham, M. A. and the Rev. J. A. Cramer, M. A.
second edition, Oxon.]

The war in Spain began nearly about the same time between
Asdrubal and the two brothers, Cn. and P. Cornelius Scipio,
and was continued, with various success, till the year 216, the
issue depending much upon the disposition of the Spaniards
themselves. The plan of Carthage after the year 216, was to
send Asdrubal with the Spanish army into Italy, and to supply
its place by an army from Africa; two victories, however, gained
by the Scipios near the Ebro, 216, and the Illiberis, 215, prevented
this from being effected, till at last both fell under the
superior power and cunning of the Carthaginians, 212. But the
arrival of the youthful P. Cornelius Scipio, who did not appear
merely to his own nation as an extraordinary genius, entirely
changed the face of affairs, and the fortunes of Rome soon became
attached to his name, which alone seemed to promise victory.
During his command in Spain, 210&mdash;206, he won over
the inhabitants while he defeated the Carthaginians, and for the
furtherance of his great design, contracted an alliance with Syphax
in Africa, 206. He was unable, however, to prevent the
march of Asdrubal into Italy, 208, which nevertheless rendered
it an easy task for him to subdue all Carthaginian Spain as far
as Gades, 206, and thus procured him the consular dignity at his
return, 205.

The carrying of the war into Africa by Scipio, notwithstanding
the opposition of the old Roman generals, and the desertion
of Syphax, who at the persuasion of Sophonisba again went over
to the Carthaginians (whose loss however was well repaid by
Masinissa, whom Scipio had won over to his side in Spain), was
followed by an important consequence; for after he had gained
two victories over Asdrubal and Syphax, 203, and taken the
latter prisoner, the Carthaginians found it necessary to recall
Hannibal from Italy, 202; and the battle of Zama terminated
the war, 201. The following were the conditions of peace:
1. That the Carthaginians should only retain the territory in
Africa annexed to their government. 2. That they should give
up all their ships of war, except ten triremes, and all their elephants.
3. That they should pay, at times specified, 10,000
talents. 4. That they should commence no war without the[Pg 346]
consent of Rome. 5. That they should restore to Masinissa all
the houses, cities, and lands that had ever been possessed by
himself or his ancestors.&mdash;The reproach usually cast upon the
Carthaginians, of having left Hannibal unsupported in Italy, in
a great measure vanishes, if we remember the plan formed in
216, to send the Spanish army into Italy, and to replace it by
an African one: a plan formed with much ability, and followed
with as much constancy. We may add to this, that the Barcine
faction maintained its influence in the government even to the
end of the war. But why they, who by the treaty of peace gave
up five hundred vessels of war, suffered Scipio to cross over
from Sicily, without sending one to oppose him, is difficult to
explain.

Power of
Rome increased
by
the war.

7. Notwithstanding her great loss of men, and
the devastation of Italy, Rome felt herself much
more powerful at the end of this war than at the
beginning.  Her dominion was not only established
over Italy, but extensive foreign countries
had been brought under it; her authority over the
seas was rendered secure by the destruction of the
naval power of the Carthaginians. The Roman
form of government, it is true, underwent no
change, but its spirit much, as the power of the
senate became almost unlimited; and although
the dawn of civilization had broken over Rome,
since her intercourse with more civilized foreigners,
the state still remained altogether a nation
of warriors. And now, for the first time,
appears in the page of history the fearful phenomenon
She becomes a military republic.
of a great military republic; and the history
of the next ten years, in which Rome overthrew
so many thrones and free states, gives a
striking proof, that such a power is the natural
enemy to the independence of all the states within
the reach of her arms. The causes which led
Rome from this time to aspire after the dominion
[Pg 347]of the world are to be found neither in her geographical
situation, which for a conquering power
by land seemed rather unfavourable; nor in the
inclination of the people, who were opposed to
the first war against Philip; but singly and entirely
in the spirit of her government. The means,
however, whereby she obtained her end, must
not be sought for merely in the excellence of her
armies and generals, but rather in that uniform,
sharp-sighted, and dexterous
Her policy.
policy, by which
she was enabled to frustrate the powerful alliances
formed against her, notwithstanding the
many adversaries who at that time sought to form
new ones. But where could be found such another
council of state, embodying such a mass
of practical political wisdom, as the Roman senate
must have been from the very nature of its organization?
All this, however, would not have been

sufficient to have subjugated the world, if the
want of good government, the degeneracy of the
military art, and an extremely corrupt state of
morals among both rulers and people, in foreign
states, had not seconded the efforts of Rome.

View of the political state of the world at this period. In
the west, Sicily (the whole island after 212), Sardinia, and Corsica,
from the year 237, and Spain, divided into citerior and
ulterior (the latter rather in name than in fact), had become
Roman provinces 206; the independence of Carthage had been
destroyed by the last peace, and her subordination secured by
the alliance of Rome with Masinissa; Cisalpine Gaul, formed
into a province, served as a barrier against the inroads of the
more northern barbarians. On the other side, in the east, the
kingdom of Macedonia, and the free states of Greece, forming
together a very complicated system, had opened a connection
with Rome since the Illyrian war, 230, and Philip's alliance
with Hannibal, 214. Of the three powers of the first rank,[Pg 348]
Macedonia, Syria, and Egypt, the two former were allied against
the latter, who, on her part, maintained a good understanding
with Rome. The states of secondary rank were, those of the &AElig;tolian
league, the kings of Pergamus, and the republic of Rhodes,
with some smaller, such as Athens: these had allied themselves
to Rome since the confederacy against Philip, 211. The
Ach&aelig;an league, on the contrary, was in the interests of Macedonia,
which Rome always endeavoured to attach to herself, in
order to make head against those of the first rank.

8. A declaration of war against Philip, notwithstanding
the opposition of the tribunes of the people,
and an attack upon Macedonia itself, according
to the constant maxim of carrying the war
into the enemy's country, immediately followed.
They could not, however, drive Philip so soon
from the fastnesses of Epirus and Thessaly, which
were his bulwarks. But Rome possessed in T.
Quintius Flaminius, who marched against Philip
as the deliverer of Greece, a statesman and general
exactly fitted for a period of great revolutions.
By the permanency of his political influence
he became indeed the true founder of the
Roman power in the east. Who could better
cajole men and nations, while they were erecting
altars to him, than T. Quintius? So artfully indeed
did he assume the character of a great
genius, such as had been given by nature to
Scipio, that he has almost deceived history itself.
The struggle between him and Philip consisted
rather in a display of talents in political stratagem
and finesse than in feats of arms: even before the
battle of Cynoscephal&aelig; had given the finishing
stroke, the Romans had already turned the balance
in their favour, by gaining over the Ach&aelig;an
league.[Pg 349]

The negotiations between Rome and Macedonia, from the
year 214, give the first striking examples of the ability and
address of the Romans in foreign policy; and they are the more
remarkable, as the treaty with the &AElig;tolians and others, 211 (see
above, p. 283), was the remote cause of the transactions which
afterwards took place in the east. The peculiar system adopted by
the Romans, of taking the lesser states under their protection as
allies, must always have given them an opportunity of making
war on the more powerful whenever they chose. This in fact
happened in the present case, notwithstanding the peace concluded
with Philip, 204. The chief object of the Romans in
this war, both by sea and land, was to drive Philip completely
out of Greece. The allies on both sides, and the conditions of
peace, were similar to those concluded with Carthage (see above,
p. 284). The destruction of the naval power of her conquered
enemies became now a maxim of Roman policy in making peace;
and she thus maintained the dominion of the seas without any
great fleet, and without losing the essential character of a dominant
power by land.

9. The expulsion of Philip from Greece brought
that country into a state of dependence upon
Rome; an event which could not have been better
secured than by the present of liberty which T.
Quintius conferred upon its inhabitants at the
Isthmian games. The system of surveillance,
which the Romans had already established in the
west over Carthage and Numidia, was now adopted
in the east over Greece and Macedonia. Roman
commissioners, under the name of ambassadors,
were sent into the country of the nations in alliance,
and were the principal means by which this
system of espionage was carried on. These however
did not fail to give umbrage to the Greeks,
particularly to the turbulent &AElig;tolians; more especially
as the Romans seemed in no hurry to withdraw
their troops from a country which they had
declared to be free.[Pg 350]

Liberty was expressly granted to the state which had taken
the part of Philip, namely, to the Ach&aelig;ans; to the others it was
naturally understood to belong. It was nevertheless three years,
194, before the Roman army evacuated Greece and withdrew
from the fortified places. The conduct of T. Quintius during
this period fully shows what he was. The Greeks indeed had
much want of such a guardian if they wished to remain quiet:
his conduct, however, in the war against Nabis, 195, shows that
he had not really at heart the tranquillity of Greece.

War with
Syria.


10. The treaty of peace with Philip contained
the seeds of a new and greater war with Syria;
but though this seemed inevitable at that time,
it did not break out till six years afterwards; and
in but few periods of the history of the world is
so great a political crisis to be found, as in this
short interval. The fall of Carthage and Macedonia
had shown the rest of the world what it
had to expect from Rome; and there was no
lack of great men sufficiently endowed with courage
and talents to resist her.
Danger of a formidable league against Rome;
The danger of a formidable league between Carthage, Syria, and
perhaps Macedonia, was never so much to be
feared, as when Hannibal, now at the head of
affairs, laboured to effect it with all the zeal which
his hatred of Rome could inspire; and they might
calculate with certainty beforehand on the accession
of many smaller states. Rome, however, by
which she frustrates.
her equally decided and artful policy procured
Hannibal's banishment from Carthage, amused
Philip by granting him some trifling advantages,
and gained over the smaller states by her ambassadors.
By these means, and by taking advantage
of the intrigues in the court of Syria, she
prevented this coalition from being formed. Antiochus
was therefore left without assistance in[Pg 351]
Greece, except from the &AElig;tolians, and a few other
unimportant allies; while Rome drew from hers,
especially the Rhodians and Eumenes, advantages
of the greatest consequence.

The first cause of contention between Rome and Antiochus
was the liberty of Greece, which the former wished to extend to
the Grecian cities of Asia, and to those in particular which had
belonged to Philip, and afterwards to Antiochus; while the latter
contended, that Rome had no right to intermeddle with the affairs
of Asia. The second cause of dispute was the occupation
of the Thracian Chersonesus by Antiochus, 196, in right of some
ancient pretensions; and Rome, on her part, would not tolerate
him in Europe. This quarrel therefore commenced as early as
196, but did not become serious till the year 105, when in consequence
of Hannibal's flight to Antiochus, together with the
turbulence and excitement of the &AElig;tolians, whose object it was
to embroil the rival powers, the political horizon was completely
overcast. What a fortunate thing it was for Rome that such
men as Hannibal and Antiochus could not understand each
other!

11. This war was much sooner brought to a
termination than the Macedonian, owing to the

half-measures adopted by Antiochus.
After having been driven from Greece by Glabrio, and
after two naval victories had opened to the Romans
the way to Asia, he felt inclined to act on
the defensive; but in

the foot of Mount Sipylus, L. Scipio gathered the
laurels which more properly belonged to Glabrio.
The total expulsion of Antiochus from Asia Minor,
even before this victory, had been the chief object
of the war.
Conditions of peace.
The conditions of peace (see above, p. 284.) were such, as not only weakened
Antiochus, but reduced him to a state of dependence.[Pg 352]

During this contest in the east, a sanguinary war was going on
in the west; from the year 201 in Spain, where the elder Cato
commanded; and from 193 in Italy itself, against the Ligurians.
Whatever may be said upon the means made use of by Rome to
increase the number of her citizens, it will always be difficult to
comprehend, not only how she could support all these wars without
being thereby weakened, but how at the same time she could
found so many colonies!

Moderation
of Rome.


12. Even after the termination of this war,
Rome refrained with astonishing moderation from
appearing in the light of a conqueror: it was only
for the liberty of Greece, and for her allies, that
she had contended! Without keeping a foot of
land for herself, she divided, with the exception
of the free Grecian cities, the conquered Asia
Minor between Eumenes and the Rhodians;
the manner, however, in which she dealt with
the &AElig;tolians, who after a long supplication for
peace were obliged to buy it dearly, shows that
she also knew how to treat unfaithful allies. The

war against the Gauls in Asia Minor was not less
necessary for the preservation of tranquillity in
that country, than it was injurious to the morals
and military discipline of the Roman army. They
here learned to levy contributions.

200&mdash;190.
Rome the arbitress of the world.

13. Thus, within the short space of ten years,
was laid the foundation of the Roman authority
in the east, and the general state of affairs entirely
changed. If Rome was not yet the ruler,
she was at least the arbitress of the world from
the Atlantic to the Euphrates. The power of the
three principal states was so completely humbled,
that they durst not, without the permission of
Rome, begin any new war; the fourth, Egypt,
had already, in the year 201, placed herself under[Pg 353]
the guardianship of Rome; and the lesser powers
followed of themselves: esteeming it an honour
to be called the allies of Rome. With this name
the nations were lulled into security, and brought
under the Roman yoke; the new political system
of Rome was founded and strengthened, partly
by exciting and supporting the weaker states
against the stronger, however unjust the cause
of the former might be, and partly by factions
which she found means to raise in every state,
even the smallest.

Although the policy of Rome extended itself everywhere by
means of her commissioners, or ambassadors, yet she kept a
more particular guard against Carthage by favouring Masinissa
at her expense, against the Ach&aelig;an league by favouring the
Spartans, and against Philip of Macedon by favouring every one
who brought any complaint against him (see above, p. 285).

14. Although these new connections and this
intercourse with foreign nations greatly aided the
diffusion of knowledge and science, and was followed
by a gradual improvement in her civilization,
yet was it nevertheless, in many respects,
detrimental to the internal state of Rome. The
introduction of the scandalous Bacchanalia, which
were immediately discovered and forbidden, shows
how easily great vices may creep in among a
people who are only indebted for their morality to
their ignorance. Among the higher classes also
the spirit of intrigue manifested itself to an astonishing
degree; particularly by the attacks directed
against the Scipios by the elder Cato,
whose restless activity became the instrument of
his malignant passions. The severity of his censorship
did not repair the evils caused by his immorality
and pernicious politics.[Pg 354]

Voluntary exile of Scipio Africanus to Linternum, 187. He
dies there, 183, the same year in which Hannibal falls under the
continued persecution of Rome. His brother Scipio Asiaticus is
also unable to escape a trial and condemnation, 185. One would
have expected a sensible effect from the exile of these two great
men; but, in a state where the ruling power is in the hands of a
body like what the Roman senate was, the change of individuals
is but of little consequence.

New broils with Philip, 185.
His death, 179.

15. Fresh disputes arose, as early as 185, with
Philip of Macedon, who soon found that they had
spared him no longer than it suited their own
convenience. Although the intervention of Philip's
youngest son, upon whom the Romans had
formed some design, prevented the powers from
coming to an immediate rupture, and war was
still further delayed by Philip's death, yet the
national hatred descended to his successor, and
continued to increase, notwithstanding an alliance
concluded with him, until the
Open war, 172.
war openly broke out (see above, p. 287).

The first circumstance which gave umbrage to Philip was the
small portion they permitted him to conquer in Athamania and
Thessaly during the war against Antiochus. But what sharpened
his animosity, much more than the object in dispute, was the
conduct of the Roman commissioners, before whom he, the king,
was called upon to defend himself as an accused party, 184.
The exclamation of Philip, that "the sun of every day had not
yet set," showed his indignation, and at the same time betrayed
his intention. The interval previous to the breaking out of the
war was anything rather than a time of peace for Rome; for
besides that the Spanish and Ligurian wars continued almost
without intermission, the revolts which broke out in Istria, 178,
and in Sardinia and Corsica, 176, produced much bloodshed.

Second Macedonian
war, ends
with the
ruin of
the kingdom,
168.

16. In the second Macedonian war, which
ended with the destruction of Perseus and his
kingdom (see above, p. 288), it required the ac[Pg 355]tive
efforts of Roman policy to prevent a powerful
confederacy from being formed against her; as
Perseus used all his endeavours to stimulate, not
only the Grecian states, and Thrace and Illyria,
but also Carthage and Asia, to enter into alliance
with him. Where was it that Rome did not at
this crisis send her ambassadors? She did not,
indeed, succeed so far as to leave her enemy quite
alone, but prepared new triumphs for herself over
the few allies she left him. The devastated Epirus,
and Gentius king of Illyria, suffered dearly for the
assistance they had lent him; the states also which
had remained neuter, the Rhodians and Eumenes,
were made to feel severely that they were the
mere creatures of Rome.

Beginning of the Macedonian war, 171, before Rome was prepared;
a deceitful truce, which raised the indignation even of
the elder senators, was the means resorted to for gaining time.
Notwithstanding this, the war at first, 170 and 169, was favourable
to Perseus; but he wanted resolution and judgment to
enable him to turn his advantages to account. In 168, Paulus
&AElig;milius, an old general, against the usual custom of the Romans,
took the command. Bloody and decisive battle near Pydna,
June 22, 168. So completely may one day overturn a kingdom
which has only an army for its support! Contemporary with this
war, and highly fortunate for Rome, was the war of Antiochus
Epiphanes with Egypt. No wonder that Rome did not, till 168,
through Popilius, command peace between them! (See above,
p. 261.)

Its consequences.

17. The destruction of the Macedonian monarchy
was attended with consequences equally
disastrous to the conquerors and the conquered.
To the first it soon gave the notion of becoming
the masters of the world, instead of its arbiters;
and it exposed the latter, for the next twenty[Pg 356]
years, to all the evils inseparable from such a
catastrophe. The system of politics hitherto pursued
by Rome could not last much longer; for if
nations suffered themselves to be brought under
the yoke by force, it was not to be expected that
they would long be held in dependence under the
specious name of liberty. But the state of things
after this war was such as contributed to hasten a
change in the form of the relations which existed
between Rome and her allies.

The republican constitution given to the already ruined and
devastated Macedonians (see above, p. 288.) and Illyrians, and
which, according to the decree of the senate, "showed to all
people that Rome was ready to bestow liberty upon them," was
granted upon such hard conditions, that the enfranchised nation
soon used every endeavour to procure themselves a king. Greece
however suffered still more than Macedonia. Here, during the
war, the spirit of faction had risen to the highest pitch; and the
arrogant insolence of the Roman party, composed for the most
part of venal wretches, was so great, that they persecuted not
only those who had espoused an opposite faction, but even those
who had joined no faction at all. Rome nevertheless could not
believe herself secure, until she had destroyed, by a cruel artifice,
all her adversaries (see above, p. 288).

18. Entirely in the same spirit did Rome proceed
against the other states from whom she had
anything to fear. These must be rendered defenceless;
and every means of effecting that purpose
was considered justifiable by the senate.
The quarrels between the successors to the throne
of Egypt were taken advantage of to cause dissensions
in that kingdom (see above, p. 260);
while Syria was retained in a state of tutelage,
by keeping the rightful heir to the throne at
Rome; and its military power neutralized by
means of their ambassadors (see above, p. 243).[Pg 357]

19. From these facts we may also conclude,
that the injuries now meditated against Carthage
were not separate projects, but rather formed part
of the general system of Roman policy at this
period, although particular events at one time retarded
their execution, and at another hastened it.
History, in recounting the incredibly bad treatment
which Carthage had to endure before her
fall, seems to have given a warning to those nations
who can take it, of what they may expect
from the domination of a powerful republic.

Cato was chief of the party which sought the destruction of
Carthage, both from a spirit of envy against Scipio Nasica, whom
he hated for his great influence in the senate; and because, when
ambassador to Carthage, he thought they did not treat him with
sufficient respect. But Masinissa's victory, 152 (see above,
p. 88), and the defection of Utica, brought this project into immediate
play. Beginning of the war, 150, the Carthaginians
having been previously inveigled out of their arms. The city,
however, was not captured and destroyed till 146, by P. Scipio
&AElig;milianus. The Carthaginian territory, under the name of
Africa, was then made a Roman province.

A new war
with Macedonia
and
Greece.

20. During this third war with Carthage, hostilities
again broke out in Macedonia, which
brought on a new war with Greece, and entirely
changed the state of both these countries. In
Macedonia, an impostor named Andriscus, who
pretended to be the son of Philip, placed himself
at the head of that highly disaffected people,
assumed the name of Philip, and became, particularly
148.
by an alliance with the Thracians, very
formidable to the Romans, until overcome by
Metellus. Rome wishing to take advantage of
this crisis to dissolve the Ach&aelig;an league, the
Ach&aelig;an war broke out (see above, p. 289). This
[Pg 358]war was begun by Metellus, and terminated by
Mummius with the
Terminated by the destruction of Corinth, 146.
destruction of Corinth. By
reducing both Macedonia and Greece to the form
of provinces, Rome now gave evident proof that
no existing relations, nor any form of government,
can prevent nations from being subjugated by a
warlike republic, whenever circumstances render
it possible.

It might have been expected, that the destruction of the two
first commercial cities in the world, in the same year, would have
been followed by important consequences to the course of trade;
but the trade of Carthage and Corinth had already been drawn
to Alexandria and Rhodes, otherwise Utica might, in some respects,
have supplied the place of Carthage.

War in Spain, 146.
140.
133.

21. While Rome was thus destroying thrones
and republics, she met in Spain with an antagonist&mdash;a
simple Spanish countryman named Viriathus&mdash;whom,
after six years' war, she could only
rid herself of by assassination. The war, nevertheless,
continued after his death against the Numantines,
who would not be subjected, but were
at last destroyed by Scipio &AElig;milianus.

The war against the Spaniards, who of all the nations subdued
by the Romans defended their liberty with the greatest obstinacy,
began in the year 200, six years after the total expulsion
of the Carthaginians from their country, 206. It was exceedingly
obstinate, partly from the natural state of the country, which was
thickly populated, and where every place became a fortress;
partly from the courage of the inhabitants; but above all, owing
to the peculiar policy of the Romans, who were wont to employ
their allies to subdue other nations. This war continued, almost
without interruption, from the year 200 to 133, and was for the
most part carried on at the same time in Hispania Citerior, where
the Celtiberi were the most formidable adversaries, and in Hispania
Ulterior, where the Lusitani were equally powerful. Hostilities
were at the highest pitch in 195, under Cato, who reduced[Pg 359]
Hispania Citerior to a state of tranquillity 185&mdash;179, when
the Celtiberi were attacked in their native territory; and 155&mdash;150,
when the Romans in both provinces were so often beaten,
that nothing was more dreaded by the soldiers at home than to
be sent there. The extortions and perfidy of Servius Galba
placed Viriathus, in the year 146, at the head of his nation, the
Lusitani: the war, however, soon extended itself to Hispania
Citerior, where many nations, particularly the Numantines, took
up arms against Rome, 143. Viriathus, sometimes victorious and
sometimes defeated, was never more formidable than in the
moment of defeat; because he knew how to take advantage of
his knowledge of the country, and of the dispositions of his countrymen.
After his murder, caused by the treachery of C&aelig;pio,
140, Lusitania was subdued; but the Numantine war became
still more violent, and the Numantines compelled the consul
Mancinus to a disadvantageous treaty, 137. When Scipio, in
the year 133, put an end to this war, Spain was certainly tranquil;
the northern parts, however, were still unsubdued, though
the Romans penetrated as far as Galatia.

Attalus III.
leaves his
kingdom to
the Romans.

133&mdash;130.

22. Towards the end of this period, the Romans
obtained at a much cheaper rate the possession
of one of their most important provinces;
for the profligate Attalus III. king of Pergamus,
bequeathing them the whole of his kingdom (on
what account is uncertain, see above, p. 292.),
they immediately took possession of it, and kept
in spite of the resistance of the legitimate heir
Aristonicus, merely ceding, as a recompense,
Phrygia to Mithridates V. king of Pontus. Thus,
by a stroke of the pen, the largest and finest part
of Asia Minor became the property of Rome.
If this extraordinary legacy was the work of
Roman policy, she paid dearly enough, in the
long run, for this accession to her power and
riches, by the destruction of her morals, and the
dreadful wars to which this legacy gave rise
under Mithridates.[Pg 360]

Roman
provinces.


23. The foreign possessions of Rome, besides
Italy, comprised at this time under the name of
provinces, a name of much higher signification
in the Latin language than in any other, Hispania
Citerior and Ulterior, Africa (the territory of Carthage),
Sicily, Sardinia and Corsica, Liguria, and
Cisalpine Gaul, in the west; and in the east,
Macedonia, Achaia, and Asia (territory of Pergamus).
The inhabitants of these countries were
How governed.
entirely subject to Rome. The administration
of them was carried on by those who had enjoyed
the office of consul, and by pr&aelig;tors, subordinate
to whom were the qu&aelig;stors, or collectors
of the revenue. The highest military and
civil powers were united in these governors; a
principal cause of that horrible oppression which
was soon felt. Troops were always kept up in
the provinces; and the Latin language everywhere
introduced (except only where Greek was
spoken), that the inhabitants might be made as
much like Romans as possible.

Till nearly the end of this period, pr&aelig;tors were expressly appointed
to each province. It was not till after the origin of the
qu&aelig;stiones perpetu&aelig;, that it became the custom for the pr&aelig;tors
who had vacated office, to succeed to the provinces (propr&aelig;tores),
a principal cause of the degeneracy of the Roman constitution.

Roman revenue.

24. The acquisition of these rich countries
naturally had great influence in augmenting the
revenue of the Romans. Though Rome was not
indeed a state, like Carthage, altogether dependent
upon finances, yet she kept these ad[Pg 361]justed
in a wonderful manner; a spirit of nice
order being observed in this as well as in every
other department of her administration. If in
extraordinary emergencies recourse were had to
native loans, to a change in the value of money,
or a monopoly of salt, order was soon restored;
while the booty obtained from conquered countries
was also a great source of the public income
so long indeed as it was reserved for the state,
and did not become the prey of the generals.

Sources of the Roman revenue (vectigalia) were: 1. Tribute
a. from the Roman citizens; that is to say, a property-tax imposed
by the senate according to the urgency of the case (which,
however, was remitted, for a long time, after the war with Perseus,
168, being no longer necessary). b. Tribute of the allies
(socii) in Italy: which seems also to have been a property-tax;
differing in different places. c. Tribute of the provinces: in
some a heavy poll-tax, in others taxes on property; in all, however,
they were paid in natural productions, mostly ordinary,
though sometimes extraordinary, as well for the salary of the
governor as for the supply of the capital. 2. The revenue from
the national domains (ager publicus), both in Italy (especially
Campania) and in the provinces; the tythes (decum&aelig;) of which
were paid by means of leases for four years, granted by the censors.
3. The revenue from the customs (portoria), collected in
the seaports and frontier towns. 4. The revenue arising from
the mines (metalla), particularly the Spanish silver mines; the
proprietors of which were obliged to pay a duty to the state.
5. The duty upon enfranchised slaves (aurum vicesimarium).
All receipts flowed into the national treasury, the &aelig;rarium; all
outgoings were exclusively ordered by the senate; and the people
were consulted as little with regard to them as they were respecting
the imposts. The officers employed were the qu&aelig;stores,
under whom were the scrib&aelig;, divided into decurias, who, though
certainly subordinate, had nevertheless great influence. Their
services, as they were not yearly changed, must have been indispensable
to the qu&aelig;stores for the time being; and the whole
management of affairs, at least in detail, must have fallen into
their hands.

THIRD PERIOD.

From the beginning of the civil broils under the Gracchi,
to the fall of the republic. B. C. 134&mdash;30. Year of
Rome, 620&mdash;724.


Sources. Concerning the first half of this important period
of the republic, down to the time of Cicero, we are sadly in
want of precise information. Not one of the contemporary
writers has been preserved to us, nor indeed any one of the
later historians who have compiled a history of the whole period.
Appian, de Bellis Civilibus; Plutarch, in his Lives of the
Gracchi; and the spirited Compendium of Vel. Paterculus,
are, for this portion, our principal authorities; and even the imperfect
summaries of the lost books of Livy, so masterly supplied
by Freinshemius here become of importance. For the times
which follow, the Jugurtha and Cataline of Sallust, are two excellent
historical cabinet pieces, and become the more valuable
for the insight they at the same time give us of the internal condition
of Rome. His great work, however, The Histories, is,
with the exception of a few precious fragments, unfortunately
lost. For the times of C&aelig;sar and Cicero, we have the Commentaries
of the first, and the Orations and Letters of the latter;
both fertile sources of information. What is left us of Dio Cassius's
History, begins with the year 69 before Christ. Of Plu[Pg 363]tarch's
Lives, besides those of the Gracchi, the following are
connected with this period: C. Marius, Sylla, Lucullus,
Crassus, Sertorius, Cato of Utica, Cicero, Brutus, and
Antonius. Upon the sources for these lives, see my treatises
cited above, p. 321.

Among the moderns, the greater part of this period is particularly
treated of by:&mdash;

De Brosses, Histoire de la R&eacute;publique Romaine dans le
cours du VIIe Si&egrave;cle par Salluste, &agrave; Dijou, 1777, 3 vols. 4to.

In German by J. C. Schleuter, 1790, etc. with remarks,
4 vols. The editor of this capital work had an idea of translating
Sallust, and supplying what is lost. It contains, besides
a translation of Jugurtha and Cataline, the period between both,
of which Sallust treats in his Histories: that is, from Sylla's
abdication, B. C. 79&mdash;67; and is equally important for its own
merits and for the period to which it belongs.

Vertot, Histoire des r&eacute;volutions arriv&eacute;es dans le gouvernement
de la R&eacute;publique Romaine. Paris, 1796, 6 vols. 12mo. Although
this justly esteemed work includes the foregoing period,
it is particularly valuable for the present.

Mably, Observations sur les Romains. Gen&egrave;ve, 1751, 2 vols.
8vo. A survey of the internal history; ingenious, but as superficial
as the Observations sur les Grecs by the same author.

Civil wars.

Power of the senate creates an aristocracy,

which is opposed by the tribunes of the people.

1. The foregoing period is composed of the
history of foreign wars alone; in this, on the contrary,
Rome appears in a continual state of internal
commotion. And if foreign hostilities interrupt
this state of things for a short time, it is
only that it may be renewed with more violence,
till at last it ends in a furious civil war. As the
almost boundless power of the senate had laid
the foundation of an exceedingly hateful family
aristocracy, against which the tribunes of the
people arrayed themselves, in the character of
powerful demagogues, there arose a new struggle
between the aristocratic and democratic parties,
which almost immediately grew into two powerful[Pg 364]
factions. This contest, from its extent and its
consequences, soon became much more important
than the ancient one between the patricians and
the plebeians.

This family aristocracy gradually arose from the power of the
magistrates, who now not only enjoyed a very high political importance,
but, by the government of the provinces, acquired
immense wealth. The present aristocracy, then, consisted of the
ruling families (nobiles) concentrated in the senate. The struggle
with the opposite party, the people (plebs), became so much the
more violent in consequence of the great abuses which had
crept into the administration, particularly in the division of the
lands of the republic; the ruling families securing to themselves
the fruits of all the victories and conquests, while the power of
the democracy, by the vast accumulation of people (without the
means of livelihood, although voting in the comitia), especially
of enfranchised slaves, who, though strangers, mostly without
power or property, formed, nevertheless, the greater part of
what was then called the Roman people.

First disturbances
under T. S.
Gracchus.
B. C. 133.

He desires
to relieve
the distress
of the lower
orders,
and dies in
the attempt:


2. Commencement of the disturbances under
the tribunate of Tib. Sempronius Gracchus, whom
former connections had long made the man of the
people. His desire was to relieve the distress
of the lower orders; and the means whereby he
hoped to do this was a better division of the
lands of the republic, now almost exclusively in
the hands of the aristocracy. His reform, therefore,
naturally led at once to a struggle with that
party. Tib. Gracchus however soon found, by
experience, that a demagogue cannot stop where
he would, however pure his intentions may be
at first; and no sooner had he obtained a pro[Pg 365]longation
of his term of office, in opposition to
the usual custom, than he fell a sacrifice to his
undertaking.

The first agrarian law of Gracchus was confirmed by the
people, notwithstanding the fruitless opposition of his colleague
Octavius, who was deposed; it decreed, that no person should
possess above five hundred acres of land, nor any child above half
that quantity. This law was, in fact, only a renewal of the
ancient lex Licinia; in the condition, however, in which Rome
now was, it bore much harder upon the property usurped by the
great families, than it did in former times. Appointment of
a committee for dividing the national lands, and for enquiring
also at the same time which were the property of the state (ager
publicus) and which were not. New popular propositions of the
elder Gracchus, especially that for the division of the treasures
left by king Attalus of Pergamus, with the view of securing his
continuance in office; great insurrection of the aristocratic party
under Scipio Nasica, and murder of Tiberius Gracchus, on the
day of electing the new tribunes of the people.

his fall does
not destroy
his party.


3. The fall of the chief of the new party,
however, occasioned any thing rather than its destruction.
Not only was there no mention of an
abrogation of the agrarian law, but the senate
was obliged to allow the place in the commission,
which had become vacant by the death of Gracchus,
to be filled up; and Scipio Nasica himself
was sent out of the way, under the pretext of an
embassy to Asia. The party of the senate did,
132.
indeed, find a powerful support for a short time
in the return of Scipio &AElig;milianus (d. 129) from
Spain; but its greatest support was found in the
difficulties of the law itself, which prevented its
execution.

Great revolt of the slaves in Sicily under Eunus, 134&mdash;131.
This contributed not a little to keep alive the dissensions, as it
showed the necessity of a reform.[Pg 366]

The tribunes
endeavour
to
increase
their power.
130.

4. Evident endeavours of the tribunes of the
people to increase their power, Gracchus having
now awakened them to a sense of it. Not satisfied
with a seat and voice in the senate, Carbo
wished that the renewing of their dignity should
be passed into a law. By the removal, however,
of the chiefs of the lower party, upon honourable
pretexts, new troubles were put off for some
years.

First establishment of the Roman power in Transalpine Gaul
by M. Fulvius Flaccus, on the occasion of his being sent to the
assistance of Massilia, 128. Southern Gaul became a Roman
province as early as 122, in consequence of the defeat of the
Allobrogi and Averni by Q. Fabius, who had been sent against
them to support the &AElig;dui, the allies of Rome. Capture of the
Balearian isles by Metellus, 123. Qu&aelig;storship of C. Gracchus
in Sicily, 128&mdash;125.

C. Gracchus.

5. These palliative remedies, however, availed
nothing after the return of C. Gracchus from
Sicily with a full determination to tread in the
footsteps of his brother. Like him, it is true,
he fell a victim to his enterprise; but the storm
that he raised during the two years of his tribunate
fell so much the more heavily, as the
popular excitement was more general, and from
his possessing more of the shining talents necessary
to form a powerful demagogue than his
brother.

First tribunate of C. Gracchus, 123. Renewal of the agrarian
law, and rendering its provisions more strict. Nevertheless, as
he increased the fermentation by his popular measures and by
acting the demagogue, and obtained the renewal of the tribunate
for the following year, 122, he so far extended his plan, as to
render it not only highly dangerous to the aristocracy, but even
to the state itself. Establishment of distributions of corn to the[Pg 367]
poor people. Plan for the formation of the knights (ordo equestris)
into a political body, as a counterbalance to the senate, by
conferring on it the right of administering justice, (judicia,)
which was taken from the senate. Still more important project
of granting to the Italian allies the privileges of Roman citizenship;
and also the formation of colonies, not only in Campania,
but also out of Italy, in Carthage. The highly refined policy of
the senate, however, by lessening this man of the people in the
eyes of his admirers, through the assistance of the tribune Livius
Drusius, prevented his complete triumph; and, once declining,
Gracchus soon experienced the fate of every demagogue, whose
complete fall is then irretrievable. General insurrection, and
assassination of C. Gracchus, 121.

Victory of
the aristocratic
faction.

6. The victory of the aristocratic faction was
this time not only much more certain and bloody,
they turned the advantages it gave them to
such good account, that they eluded the agrarian
law of Gracchus, and indeed, at last, completely
abrogated it. But the seeds of discord already
disseminated, especially among the Italian allies,
could not be so soon checked, when once the
subjects of these states had conceived the idea
that they were entitled to a share in the government.
How soon these party struggles might
be renewed, or indeed a civil war break out, depended
almost entirely upon foreign circumstances,
and the chance of a bolder leader being
found.

Agrarian law evaded: at first by repealing an act which prohibited
the transfer of the national lands already divided, whereby
the patricians were enabled to buy them again;&mdash;afterwards by
the lex Thoria: complete stop put to all further divisions, a land-tax,
to be distributed among the people, being instituted in its
stead; but even this latter was very soon annulled.

Effects of
this party-spirit
in
corrupting
the nation.

7. Visible effects of this party spirit upon
public morals, which now began to decline the
more rapidly, in proportion to the increase of
foreign connections. Neither the severity of the
censorship, nor the laws against luxury (leges
sumtuari&aelig;), nor those which now became necessary
against celibacy, could be of much service in
this respect. This degeneracy was not only to be
found in the cupidity of the higher ranks, but also
in the licentiousness of the lower orders.

Luxury in Rome was first displayed in the public administration
(owing to the excessive accumulation of wealth in the treasury,
especially during the Macedonian wars) before it infected
private life; and the avarice of the great long preceded the latter.
The sources from whence they satisfied this passion were found
in the extortions of the governors of provinces, their great power,
and the distance from Rome rendering the leges repetundarum of
but little effect. Probably the endeavours of the allied princes
and kings to gain a party in the senate was a still more fruitful
source, as they could obtain their end only by purchase, and so
gave a new impulse to the cupidity and intriguing disposition of
the members of that council. But private luxury requires everywhere
some time to ripen. It attained its height immediately
after the Mithridatic wars.

The African
war against
Jugurtha.
118&mdash;106.


8. This corruption was manifested in a striking
[Pg 369]manner in the next great war that Rome entered
into, which was in Africa, against Jugurtha of
Numidia, the adopted grandson of Masinissa;
and soon after against his ally Bocchus of Mauritania.
This war, kindled and maintained by the
avarice of the Roman nobles, which Jugurtha had
already had an opportunity of knowing at the
siege of Numantia, paved the way to the aggrandizement of
C. Marius
C. Marius, a new demagogue, who,
being also a formidable general, did much more
harm to the state than even the Gracchi.

Commencement of the quarrel of Jugurtha with the two sons
of Micipsa, and assassination of Hiempsal, one of them, 118.&mdash;When
the other, Adherbal, arrived at Rome, 117, the party of
Jugurtha had already succeeded, and obtained a partition of the
kingdom. New attack upon Adherbal, who is besieged in Cirta,
and, notwithstanding the repeated embassies of Rome to Jugurtha,
is compelled to surrender, and is put to death, 112. The
tribune C. Memmius constrains the senate to declare war against
Jugurtha; but Jugurtha purchases a peace of the consul Calpurnius
Piso, 111.&mdash;Nevertheless Memmius hinders the ratification
of the peace, and Jugurtha is required to justify himself at
Rome. He would probably, however, have bought his acquittal,
if the murder of his kinsman Massiva, 110, by the help of Bomilcar,
had not rendered it impossible. The war is renewed
under the consul Sp. Albinus and his brother Aulus, 110, but with
very little success, until the incorruptible Q. Metellus took the
command, 109, who would have put an end to it, notwithstanding
the great talents now displayed as a general by Jugurtha,
and his alliance with Bocchus, 108, had he not been supplanted
by Marius, who obtains the consulship by his popularity, 107.
Marius is obliged to have recourse to perfidy to get Jugurtha
into his hands, who is betrayed by Bocchus, 106. Numidia is
divided between Bocchus and two grandsons of Masinissa,
Hiempsal and Hiarbas.

obtains the
consulate;


9. The elevation of Marius to the consulate not
only humbled the power of the aristocracy, but
[Pg 370]also showed, for the first time, that the way was
open to a man of low birth (homo novus) to the
highest offices; the method, however, which he
had taken to form his army, entirely against the
Roman custom, that is, of composing it of the
lower orders (capite censis) must have rendered
him doubly formidable. Nevertheless, he would
scarcely have effected so great a change in the
constitution, if a new and terrible war had not
rendered his services indispensable:&mdash;this was
defeats the Cimbri and Teutones;
the threatened invasion of the Cimbri and Teutones
the most powerful nations of the north,
during which a new and violent rebellion of the
slaves was raging in Sicily:&mdash;for after the defeat
of so many Roman armies, the people believed
that no one but the conqueror of Jugurtha could
save Italy; and Marius knew so well how to turn
this to account, that he remained consul during
four successive years.

The Cimbri, or Cimmerians, probably a nation of German
origin, from beyond the Black sea, originated a popular migration
which extended from thence as far as Spain. Their march was
perhaps occasioned, or accelerated, by the Scythian war of
Mithridates; and their course, like that of most nomad races,
was from east to west along the Danube. They had already, in
113, defeated the consul Papirius Carbo, near Noreia in Styria.
In their progress towards the west they were joined by German,
Celtic, and Helvetic tribes (the Teutones, Ambrones, and Tigurians).&mdash;Attack

buys his
sixth consulate.

10. Although during this war the power of the
popular party had sensibly increased, yet the
storm did not break out until Marius bought
his sixth consulate. Now, even in Rome itself,
he wished to avenge himself upon his
enemies; and what could the senate do, when it
had at its head a demagogue in the consul himself?&mdash;His
league with the tribune Saturnius, and
the pr&aelig;tor Glaucias, forming already a true triumvirate,
would have overthrown the republic
after the expulsion of Metellus, if the unbridled
licentiousness of the rabble connected with his
allies had not obliged him to break with them,
lest he should sacrifice the whole of his popularity.

The measures of this cabal, who wished to appear as if treading
in the steps of the Gracchi, were principally directed against
Q. Metellus, the chief of the party of the senate, and who, since
the African war, had been the mortal foe of Marius. After the
exile of Metellus, occasioned by his opposition to a new agrarian
law, this faction usurped the rights of the people, and lorded it
in the committees; until, at a new election of consuls, a general
revolt, favoured by Marius himself, took place of all the well-disposed
citizens against them; Saturnius and Glaucias were
besieged in the capitol, forced to surrender, and executed. The[Pg 372]
return of Metellus from his voluntary exile soon followed, 92,
much against the will of Marius, who was obliged to retire into
Asia.

98&mdash;91.

11. The few years of tranquillity which Rome
now enjoyed, brought to maturity many benefits
and many evils, the seeds of which had been
already sown. On one hand the rising eloquence
of Antonius, Crassus, and others, was employed
with effect against the oppressors of the provinces
in the state trials (questiones); and some
generous spirits used all their endeavours to heal
the wounds of Sicily, Asia, and other provinces, by
a better administration; while, on the other hand,
the power of the ordo equestris became a source of
much abuse: for besides their right to sit in the
tribunals (judiciis), which C. Gracchus had conferred
upon them, they had also obtained the
farming of the leases, and thereby the collection
of the revenue in the provinces; by which means
they were enabled not only to oppose every reform
that was attempted in the latter, but even
at Rome to hold the senate in a state of dependence.
The struggle which now arose between
them and the senate respecting the judicia
(or right to preside in the tribunal), was one of
the most fatal to the republic, as this right was
abused by them for the purpose of satisfying their
personal rancour, and oppressing the greatest
men. The tribune M. Livius Drusus the younger,
it is true, wrested from them half their power;
but, alas! the manner in which he did it kindled
into a flame the fire which had been smouldering
from the time of the Gracchi.

notwithstanding which it maintained its independence, although

above, p. 294).

War of the
allies,
91&mdash;88.

12. Revolt of the Italian tribes, who desire to
obtain the right of Roman citizens; whereupon
the bloody war of the allies ensues. Although
the oppression of Rome had been preparing this
war for a long time, yet it was an immediate
consequence of the intrigues of the Roman demagogues,
who since the law of the younger
Gracchus, had, with the view of making themselves
popular, continually flattered the allies
with the hope of sharing the privileges of Roman
citizenship. It was however soon seen, that the
allies were not at a loss among themselves for
leaders, capable of forming great plans and executing
them with vigour. Italy was about to
become a republic, with Corfinium for its capital
instead of Rome. Neither could Rome have
saved herself from such an event, but by gradually
permitting the allies to enjoy the complete
freedom of the city.

After the civil wars of the Gracchi, large bands of the allies
were continually flocking to Rome. These were in the pay of the
demagogues, whom the lex Licinia, 95, had banished from Rome,
and thereby laid the foundation of the revolt. From that time
the conspiracy among these tribes began, and attained without
interruption such a degree of maturity, that the carelessness of
Rome can only be accounted for from the party fury which then
existed, and which the lex Varia, 91, enacted against the promoters
of rebellion, served only to inflame the more. The murder
of the tribune Livius Drusus, 91, a very ambiguous character,
brought the affair to an open rupture. In this alliance were
the Marsi, Picentes, Peligni, Marrucini, Frentani, the Samnites,
who played a principal part, the Hirpini, Apuli, and the Lu[Pg 374]cani.
In this war, which was so much the more bloody, as it was
mostly composed of separate contests and sieges, especially of the

13. The war now just ended, essentially changed
the constitution of Rome, as she no longer remained,
as hitherto, the exclusive head of the
whole state; and although the new citizens were
only formed into eight tribes, yet their influence
must soon have been felt in the committees, on
account of the readiness with which they promoted
factions. Besides this, the long-cherished
private hatred between Marius and Sylla was
greatly strengthened by this war, as Sylla's fame
was considerably raised thereby, while that of
Marius was proportionably diminished. An opportunity
was only wanted, like that which the
first Pontine war soon furnished, to stir up a new
civil war, which threatened to destroy the liberty
of Rome.

Alliance of
Marius with
Sulpicius
against
Sylla,
88.

14. Alliance of Marius with the tribune Sulpicius,
with the view of wresting from Sylla the
command of the forces against Mithridates, already
conferred upon him by the senate. The
ease with which Sylla, at the head of an army on
which he could depend, expelled the chiefs of
this party, seems to have left him ignorant of the
fact, that the party itself was not thereby destroyed.
However judicious may have been his[Pg 375]
other measures, the elevation of Cinna to the consulship
was an error in policy of which Italy had
still more reason to repent than himself. How
much blood might have been spared if Sylla had
not unseasonably wished to become popular!

Proposition of Sulpicius for an indiscriminate distribution of
the new citizens and freemen among all the tribes of Italy,
that he might thereby gain a strong party in his favour, which,
by a violent assembly of the people, transfers the command from
Sylla to Marius. March of Sylla upon Rome, and expulsion of
Marius, who, by a series of adventures almost surpassing belief,
escapes to Africa and is proscribed with his son and ten of his
partisans. Reestablishment of the power of the senate, whose
number is made up by three hundred knights. Sylla, after
having caused his friend C. Octavius and his enemy L. Cinna to
be elected consuls, hastens back to Greece.

First war against Mithridates. 89&mdash;85.

His great power:

that of Rome divided.

15. First war against Mithridates the Great.
Sylla gains several victories over that king's
generals in Greece; wrests from him all his
conquests, and restricts him to his hereditary dominions.
Rome since the time of Hannibal had
met with no such powerful opponent as the king
of Pontus, who in a few months had become
master of all Asia Minor, Macedonia, and Greece,
and threatened even Italy itself; we must besides
consider, that the war on the side of Rome was
carried on in a manner altogether different from
that of any previous one; as Sylla, after the victory
of the opposite party, being himself proscribed
in Rome, was obliged to continue it with
his own army, and his own private resources.
The unfortunate countries which were the theatre
of this war, felt as many calamities during the
struggle, as Italy was doomed to suffer after its
close.[Pg 376]

Commencement of the war by Mithridates before the termination
of that of the allies, 89, by taking possession of Cappadocia
and Paphlagonia. He was not less formidable by his alliance
with the tribes along the Danube, and his navy, than by his land
forces; and the irritation of the people of Asia against Rome
rendered his enterprise still more easy. Double victory over
Nicomedes king of Bithynia and the Roman general M. Aquilius,
followed by the conquest of all Asia Minor except the isle of
Rhodes. Massacre of all the Roman citizens in the states of
Asia Minor. Expedition of the king's army into Greece, under
the command of his general Archelaus, who makes Athens the
theatre of the war, 88. Siege and capture of that unfortunate
town by Sylla, 1st March, 87. Repeated great defeats of
Mithridates's army under the command of Archelaus, near Chalcis,
and afterwards near Orchomenus, by Sylla, 86, whose general
plan was formed upon the entire destruction of his enemies.
Negotiations for peace commenced by Archelaus, and finally
settled at a personal conference between Sylla and Mithridates.
The adverse party in Rome, however, had in the mean time sent
a new army into Asia Minor, to act as well against Sylla as
against Mithridates, under the command of L. Valerius Flaccus,
who, however, is assassinated by his lieutenant Fimbria. The
latter gains some advantages over the king, but, being shut up
by Sylla, kills himself. Owing to the licentiousness of his army,
which Sylla dared not restrain; and the heavy contributions exacted
by him in Asia Minor after the peace, in order to carry
on the war in Italy, 84; together with the bodies of pirates
formed out of the fleet disbanded by Mithridates, these unfortunate
countries were almost ruined; the opulent cities more
especially.

New revolution in Rome
under Cinna and Marius.

16. But during this war a new revolution took
place in Rome, which not only overthrew the
order reestablished by Sylla, but also, by the
victory of the democratic faction under Cinna and
Marius, gave rise to a wild anarchy of the people,
and which the death of Marius, alas, too late for
Rome! only rendered more destructive; as the
leaders themselves could no longer restrain the
savage hordes of their own party.  However[Pg 377]
dreadful the prospect of the return of Sylla might
seem, it was nevertheless the only hope that
remained for all those who had not joined the
popular faction, or had not some connection with
its leaders.

Revolt of Cinna, brought on by the proscriptions, soon after
the departure of Sylla; Cinna, by distributing the new citizens
into all the tribes, hoped to raise himself a party; but C. Octavius,
at the head of the senate and ancient citizens, drove him
from Rome, and forced him to give up the consulship, 87. He
however soon raised a powerful army in Campania, and recalled Marius
from exile. Capture and pillage of Rome, already weakened
by famine, and horrible massacre of the inhabitants; after which
Marius and Cinna name themselves consuls and banish Sylla.
Death of Marius, 13th Jan. 86. C. Papirius Carbo succeeds him
in the consulship. The mediation of the senate is useless, as the
chiefs of both parties can only hope for security by the annihilation
of their adversaries. The murder of Cinna by his own soldiers,
84, entirely deprives the dominant faction of a competent leader.
Neither the cowardly Carbo, although he remained consul alone,
nor the stupid Norbanus, nor the youth C. Marius (the son), had
sufficient personal authority for that purpose; and Sertorius
leaves Italy in good time to kindle a new flame in Spain.

Sylla's return,
and
bloody civil
war,
83.

17. Return of Sylla to Italy, and a terrible
civil war, which ends only with the extermination
of the democratic faction, and his own elevation
to the perpetual dictatorship. Although his enemies
had so much advantage over him in point of
numbers, yet their party was so little consolidated,
that he with his veterans could not fail to
obtain an easy victory. The slaughter during this
war fell for the most part upon the Italian tribes,
who had joined the party of Marius, and this
afforded Sylla the means of giving settlements to
his own soldiers; but most of the horrors of this
revolution which fell to the share of Rome, were
reserved till the day of victory was past.
Sylla's proscription.
Sylla's[Pg 378]
proscription, which should only have punished his
personal enemies, was the signal for a general
massacre, as every one took that opportunity to
rid himself of his private foes; and avarice did as
much as vengeance. Who in these days, so terrible
to Italy, was sure of his life or property?
And yet, when we consider the dreadful circumstances
which attended the foregoing dominion of
the people, deduct all that was done without
Sylla's knowledge, and consider how much he was
obliged to do in order to satisfy his army, we
shall find it difficult to say how far he deserves
the reproach of wanton cruelty.

Sylla's arrival; victory over Norbanus immediately after, and
seduction of the army of the consul Scipio, 82. After this
almost every person of distinction declared in his favour, and the
young Pompey having brought to him an army which he had
himself raised, his party acquired more consideration, and himself
more power. Victory over the younger Marius, near Sacriportum,
who throws himself into Pr&aelig;neste, where he is besieged.
But the great and decisive battle gained before the gates of
Rome, over the Samnites under the command of Telisinus, is
followed by the fall of Pr&aelig;neste and the capture of Rome.
After the proscription which immediately ensued, Sylla is created
perpetual dictator, and secures his power in Rome by the emancipation
of ten thousand slaves, whose masters he had proscribed;
and in Italy by colonies of his veterans, whom he establishes at
the expense of his enemies.

Reform in
the constitution:
81&mdash;79.

power of the senate restored.

Sylla's abdication, 79.

18. Great reform in the constitution during the
two years' dictatorship of Sylla. The aristocracy
of the senate, which he filled up with knights,
was not only reestablished, but he also stopped
the sources from which the great disorders of the
democracy had hitherto proceeded. It seems
probable that his natural indolence, which led[Pg 379]
him to prefer a life of luxurious ease to one of
laborious activity, when he was no longer spurred
to the latter by his passions, was the chief cause
of his voluntary abdication. He had, however,
the great advantage over Marius, of not being the
sport of his own feelings. The conduct of Sylla,
indeed, was so consistent throughout, that it satisfactorily
shows he knew very well what was his
ultimate aim&mdash;which Marius never did.

Internal regulations of Sylla by the leges Corneli&aelig;. 1. Law
to restrain the influence of the tribunes, by taking from them
their legislative power. 2. Law respecting the succession to the
magistracy; the number of pr&aelig;tors fixed to eight, and the qu&aelig;stors
to twenty. 3. Lex de majestate, especially to limit the
power of the governors of provinces, and to abolish their exactions.
4. Lex de judiciis, whereby the judicia were again restored to the
senate. 5. Several police regulations, de sicariis, de veneficiis,
etc. for the preservation and tranquillity of Rome, upon which
everything depended. 6. The lex de civitate, taking from the
Latins and several Italian cities and tribes the privileges of
Roman citizens, upon which they set so much store, although
we scarcely know in what they consisted. Foreign wars: War
in Africa against the leaders of the democratic faction, Cn. Domitius
and king Hiarbas, which is ended by a triumph to Pompey,
80. Second war against Mithridates begun by Murena,
in hopes of obtaining a triumph, to whom Archelaus came over;
but which, under the command of Sylla, terminates in an accommodation.

A state like
Rome exposed
to
convulsions.

19. Nevertheless it was impossible that the
enactments of Sylla should be long observed; as
the evil lay too deep to be eradicated by laws.
A free state like that of Rome, with no middle
class, must, from its nature, be exposed to continual
convulsions, and these will be more or less
violent in proportion to its greatness. Besides,
as in the last revolution almost all property had[Pg 380]
changed hands, there was spread over all Italy a
powerful party, who desired nothing so much as
Counter-revolution desired by many.
a counter-revolution. And to this we may add,
that there were many young men, such as Lucullus,
Crassus, and above all Pompey, who had
opened to themselves a career during the late
troubles, which they would scarcely yet wish to
bring to a close. It will not then appear strange,
that immediately after the death of Sylla (&#8224; 88), a
&AElig;milius Lepidus.
consul, M. &AElig;milius Lepidus, should form the design
of becoming a second Marius; a design which
could only be frustrated by the courage and activity
of such a patriotic citizen as Q. Lutatius
Catulus, his colleague.

Attempt of Lepidus to rescind the acts of Sylla, 78. Defeated,
first before Rome and again in Etruria, by Catulus and Pompey,
77, after which he dies in Sardinia.

Civil war of Sertorius in Spain.

77&mdash;72.

20. But much more dangerous for Rome might
have been the civil war kindled by Sertorius in
Spain, if the plan of that exalted republican to
invade Italy had succeeded. Even Pompey himself,
after a six years' struggle, would hardly have
prevented it, had it not been for the worthlessness
of the Roman vagabonds who surrounded
him, and his assassination by Perpenna. The
rapid termination of the war after the fall of its
conductor, is a circumstance much more creditable
to Sertorius than to the conqueror Pompey.

The forces of Sertorius in Spain, consisted not only of the
party of Marius which he had collected, but more essentially of
the Spaniards, particularly the Lusitanians, whom he had inspired
with an unbounded confidence in himself. Very variable
success of the war against Metellus and Pompey, who receive
but very little support from Rome, 77&mdash;75. Negotiation of Ser[Pg 381]torius
with Mithridates the Great, and interchange of embassies
without any important result, 75. Sertorius assassinated by
Perpenna, 72.

The third
Mithridatic
war; combined
with
the servile
war, and
that of the
pirates,


21. Before, however, the flame of war was
totally extinguished in the west, Mithridates
kindled a new and much fiercer one in the east;
at the same time a war of slaves and gladiators
was raging with terrible fury in Italy itself; and
whole fleets of pirates not only ravaged the Italian
coasts, but threatened Rome herself with a famine,
and obliged her to have recourse to a mode
of naval warfare altogether peculiar. All these
enemies were not without intelligence with one
another; and colossal as was the power of the republic
at that time, and rich as Rome was in distinguished
men, it seems probable that the storm
threatens the downfal of Rome.
which beat on every side between 75&mdash;71, would
have razed her to the ground, if a stricter alliance
could have been formed between Sertorius, Spartacus,
and Mithridates. But the great difficulty
of communication which at that time existed, and
without which probably a republic such as the
Roman never could have been formed, proved of
more assistance at this crisis than at any other.

The third Mithridatic war, occasioned by the will of Nicomedes
king of Bithynia, who had bequeathed his kingdom to
Rome (see above, p. 294), was carried on in Asia Minor, first by
Lucullus, 74&mdash;67, and afterwards by Pompey, 66&mdash;64. Mithridates,
being better prepared, had already concluded an alliance
with Sertorius in Spain, 75. But the deliverance of Cyzicus by
Lucullus, 73, and the defeat of the king's fleet, intended to act
against Italy, not only frustrated all his original plans, but were
followed by the occupation of his own dominions, 72 and 71, by
the enemy, notwithstanding a new army which Mithridates collected,
mostly from the nomad hordes of Northern Asia. Flight[Pg 382]
of Mithridates to Tigranes, 71, who positively refused to deliver
him up, and formed an alliance with him, 70; while the Parthian,
Arsaces XII. held both parties in suspense by negotiations.
Victory of Lucullus over the allied sovereigns, near Tigranocerta,
69, and Artaxata, 68; but the mutinies which now
broke out among his troops not only hindered him from following
up these advantages, but turned the scale so much in Mithridates's
favour, that in 68 and 67 he quickly regained almost all his
dominions, even while the Roman commissioners were on their
route to take possession of them. Lucullus, by his reform in the
finances of Asia Minor, raises a powerful party against himself in
Rome, and thereby loses his command.

The servile
war,
73&mdash;71.


22. The war of the slaves and gladiators, which
happened nearly at the same time, was, from the
theatre of action being in its neighbourhood,
equally dangerous to Rome; it became still more
terrible from the violence with which these outraged
beings sought to revenge their wrongs, and
more formidable from the talents of their leader,
Spartacus; and the conclusion of this struggle
seemed, therefore, of so much importance to
Rome, that it gave
terminated by Crassus.
M. Crassus a much higher influence
in the state than he could ever have obtained
by his riches alone.

Commencement of this war by a number of runaway gladiators,
who, being strengthened by an almost general revolt of the
slaves in Campania, 73, soon became very formidable. The defeat
of four generals, one after the other, throws open to Spartacus
the road to the Alps, and enables him to leave Italy; but
the greediness of booty manifested by his hordes, who wished to
plunder Rome, obliged him to return. Crassus takes the command
and rescues Rome, 72; upon which Spartacus retires into
Lower Italy, hoping to form a junction with the pirates, and to
carry the war into Sicily, but is deceived by them, 71. His
complete overthrow near the Silarus, 71. Pompey, then returning
from Spain, finds means to seize a sprig of the laurel chaplet
which by right should have adorned only the brow of Crassus;[Pg 383]
hence arises a misunderstanding between these two commanders,
during their consulate, 70, which threatened to be dangerous
to the state.

The war
against the
pirates;


23.  The war against the pirates of Sicily and
Isauria was not only very important in itself, but
still more so in its consequences. It procured
for Pompey a legal power such as no Roman general
had ever before enjoyed; and the quick and
glorious manner in which he brought it to a close,
opened for him the way to the great object of his
terminated by Pompey.
ambition&mdash;the conduct of the war in Asia against
Mithridates.

The extraordinary power acquired by these pirates was owing
partly to the great negligence of the Romans in sea affairs, (see
page 340), partly to the war against Mithridates, who had taken
the pirates into his pay, and partly also to the Roman oppressions
in Asia Minor. War had been undertaken against them as early
as 75, by P. Servilius; but his victories, though they procured
him the title of Isauricus, did them but little harm. They were
to be dreaded, not only for their piracies, but because they also
offered an easy means of communication between the other enemies
of Rome from Spain to Asia. The new attack of the pr&aelig;tor
M. Antonius upon Crete, proved a complete failure; but it was
the cause of that hitherto independent island being again attacked,
68, by Metellus, and reduced to a Roman province, 67.
Pompey takes the command against the pirates with extraordinary
privileges, obtained for him by Gabinius, and finishes the
war in forty days, 67.

Fall of Mithridates.

24.  After these triumphs over so many enemies,
Mithridates was the only one which now remained;
and Pompey had here again the good
fortune to conclude a struggle already near its
end; for notwithstanding his late success, Mithridates
had never been able completely to recover
himself. His fall undoubtedly raised the power[Pg 384]
of Rome in Asia Minor to its highest pitch; but
it brought her, at the same time, into contact
with the Parthians.

Pompey obtains the conduct of the war against Mithridates
with very extensive privileges, procured for him by the tribune
Manilius (lex Manilia), notwithstanding the opposition of Catulus,
67. His victory by night, near the Euphrates, 66. Subjection
of Tigranes, while Mithridates flies into the Crimea, 65,
whence he endeavours to renew the war. Campaign of Pompey
in the countries about the Caucasus, 65; he marches thence into
Syria, 64. Mithridates kills himself in consequence of the defection
of his son Phraates, 63. Settlement of Asiatic affairs
by Pompey: besides the ancient province of Asia, the maritime
countries of Bithynia, nearly all Paphlagonia and Pontus, are
formed into a Roman province, under the name of Bithynia;
while on the southern coast Cilicia and Pamphylia form another
under the name of Cilicia; Ph&#339;nicia and Syria compose a third,
under the name of Syria. On the other hand, Great Armenia
is left to Tigranes; Cappadocia to Ariobarzanes; the Bosphorus
to Pharnaces; Jud&aelig;a to Hyrcanus (see page 310); and some
other small states are also given to petty princes, all of whom
remain dependent on Rome. The tribes inhabiting Thrace during
the Mithridatic war, were first defeated by Sylla, 85, and their
power was afterwards nearly destroyed by the proconsuls of Macedonia:
as by Appius, in 77; by Curio, who drove them to
the Danube, 75&mdash;73; and especially by M. Lucullus, while his
brother was engaged in Asia. Not only the security of Macedonia,
but the daring plans of Mithridates rendered this necessary.

State of Rome;
changes in her constitution;
the restoration of the power of the tribunes.

25. The fall of Mithridates raised the republic
to the highest pitch of her power: there was no
longer any foreign foe of whom she could be
afraid. But her internal administration had undergone
great changes during these wars. Sylla's
aristocratic constitution was shaken by Pompey,
in a most essential point, by the reestablishment
of the power of the tribunes, which was done because
neither he nor any leading men could ob[Pg 385]tain
their ends without their assistance. It was
by their means that Pompey had procured such
unlimited power in his two late expeditions, that
the existence of the republic was thereby endangered.
It was, however, a fortunate circumstance
for Rome, that Pompey's vanity was sufficiently
gratified by his being at the head of affairs, where
he avoided the appearance of an oppressor.

Reiterated attempts of the tribune Sicinius to annul the constitution
of Sylla defeated by the senate, 76. But as early as
75 Opimius obtained that the tribunes should not be excluded
from honourable offices, and that the judgments (judicia) should
be restored to the knights (equites). The attempts of Licinius
Macer, 72, to restore the tribunes to all their former powers,
encountered but a short opposition; and their complete reestablishment
was effected by Pompey and Crassus during their consulate,
in 70.

This victory
of the democrats
leads to an
oligarchy.
70.

Catiline's conspiracy.


26. This victory of the democratic faction, however,
in consequence of the use made of it by
some leading men, necessarily led the way to an
oligarchy, which after the consulate of Pompey
and Crassus became very oppressive.  Catiline's
conspiracy, which was not matured till after several
attempts, would have broken up this confined
aristocracy, and placed the helm of state
in the hands of another and still more dangerous
faction: a faction composed in part of needy profligates
and criminals dreading the punishment
of their crimes, and partly of ambitious nobles.
It occasioned a short civil war; but procured
Cicero.
Cicero a place in the administration. With what
pleasure do we forgive the little weaknesses and
failings of one so gifted with talents and great
virtues! of one who first taught Rome, in so[Pg 386]
many ways, what it was to be great in the robe
of peace!

Catiline's first conspiracy, in which C&aelig;sar and Crassus seem
to have been implicated, 66, as well as in the second, 65: failure
of the former by chance&mdash;of the latter through Piso's death.
The third broke out in 64, as well in Rome, where the conspirators,
having no armed force, were soon suppressed by the vigilance
and activity of Cicero, 63, as in Etruria, where a victory
of the proconsul Antonius over Catiline, who was left dead on
the field, concluded it, 62.

Effects of
the Asiatic
war on the
Roman
manners.






27. The suppression of this conspiracy, however,
did not stay the effect which the recently
concluded Asiatic war had upon Roman manners.
The luxury of the east, though united with
Grecian taste, which had been introduced among
the great by Lucullus; the immense riches poured
into the treasury by Pompey; the tempting examples
of unlimited power, which single citizens
had already exercised; the purchase of the
magistracy by individuals, in order, like Verres,
after the squandering of millions, to enrich themselves
again in the provinces; the demands of
the soldiers upon their generals; and the ease
with which an army might be raised by him who
had only money enough to pay it; all these circumstances
must have foreboded new and approaching
convulsions, even if the preceding
storms in this colossal republic, in which we
must now judge of virtues and vices, as well as
of riches and power, by a very magnified standard,
had not formed

alone to stem the impetuous torrent of the revolution,
and was sufficiently powerful to retard its
progress for a time; or, like
Pompey.
Pompey, who by

C&aelig;sar,
whose boundless ambition could only be surpassed
by his talents, and courage, "who would
rather be the first in a village than the second

threatening the senate with a new dictator, appeared
an eventful moment.

Attempt of Pompey, through the tribune Metellus Nepos, to
be allowed to return to Rome at the head of his army, frustrated
by the firmness of Cato, 62.

Pompey's
return revives
the
struggle between
him
and the senate,
61.


28.  The arrival of Pompey in Rome renewed
the struggle between the senate and that powerful
general, although he had disbanded his army on
landing in Italy. The ratification of his management
of affairs in Asia, which was the chief point
of contention, was opposed by the leading men of
the senate, Cato, the two Metelli, and Lucullus,
which induced Pompey to attach himself entirely
to the popular party, by whose means he hoped
to obtain his end;
C&aelig;sar's return from Lusitania, 61.
C&aelig;sar's return, however, from
his province of Lusitania, entirely changed the
face of affairs.

and Crassus,

consulate,

the government
of the
two Gauls
and Illyria
for five
years.

29. Close union between C&aelig;sar, Pompey, and
Crassus; that is, a secret alliance, formed by the
interposition of C&aelig;sar. That which formed the
height of the ambition of Pompey and Crassus
was only regarded by C&aelig;sar as the means by
which he might be able to effect his. His con[Pg 388]sulate&mdash;a
kind of dictatorship under the mask of
great popularity&mdash;necessarily paved the way to
his future career, as by giving him the government
of the two Gauls and Illyria for five years,
it opened a wide field for conquest, and gave him
an opportunity of forming an army devoted to his
will.

C&aelig;sar's abode and campaign in Gaul from the spring of 58 till
the end of the year 50. By arresting the emigration of the Helvetians,
and by the expulsion of the Germans, under Ariovistus,
from Gaul, 58, C&aelig;sar gained an opportunity of intermeddling in
the internal affairs of that country, and afterwards of subduing
it, which was completed by his victory over the Belg&aelig;, 57, and
the Aquitani, 56; so that C&aelig;sar was at liberty to undertake his
several expeditions, as well in Britain, 55 and 54, as in Germany,
54 and 53. But the repeated revolts of the Gauls, 53&mdash;51,
especially under Vercingetorix, 52, occasioned a war no less obstinate
than their first conquest. Roman policy continued the
same throughout. The Gauls were subdued, by the Romans appearing
as their deliverers; and in the country they found allies
in the &AElig;dui, Allobroges, etc.

30. The triumvirate, in order to establish their
power upon a solid foundation, took care, by the
management of the tribune Clodius, to get rid of
the leaders of the senate, Cato and Cicero, before
the departure of C&aelig;sar; and this they did by
giving the former a kingdom to govern, and by
procuring the banishment of the latter. They
must however soon have discovered, that so bold
a demagogue as Clodius could not be used as a
mere machine. And, indeed, after C&aelig;sar's departure
he raised himself so much above the triumvirs,
that Pompey was soon obliged, for his
own preservation, to permit Cicero to return from
exile, which could only be effected by the most
violent efforts of the tribune Milo. The power of[Pg 389]
Clodius, however, was but little injured thereby,
although Pompey, to put a stop to the source of
these disorders, and revive his own popularity,
procured the nomination of himself as pr&aelig;fectus
annon&aelig;, or superintendent of provisions.

Exile of Cicero, the greater part of which he spent in Macedonia,
from April, 58, till 4th Sept. 57. Ptolemy king of Cyprus
deposed, and that island reduced to a Roman province by
Cato, on the proposition of Clodius, 57 (see page 264). The
personal dislike of Clodius and the riches of the king were the
causes that brought upon him this misfortune.

Middleton's Life of Cicero, 2 vols. 8vo. This work is almost
a complete history of Rome during the age of Cicero; for
whom the writer discovers an undue partiality.

&#8224; M. Tullius Cicero, all his Letters translated, in chronological
order, and illustrated with notes, by C. M. Wieland.
Zurich, 1808. With a preliminary view of the life of Cicero.
Of all Germans the writings of Wieland, whether original or
translations (and to which can we give the preference?) afford
the most lively insight into Greek and Roman antiquity at various
periods. What writer has so truly seized its spirit, and
placed it so faithfully and elegantly before his readers? His
labours on the Letters of Cicero (whose foibles he exposes with
a rigorous and unflinching hand) serve to make us much better
acquainted with Rome, as it then was, than any Roman history.

Jealousy of
the triumvirate.

31. A jealousy arises between the triumvirate,
as C&aelig;sar, though absent, still found means to
keep up his party at Rome in such watchful activity,
that Pompey and Crassus considered it
impossible to maintain their own influence, except
by procuring such concessions as had been
made to him. Harmony once more restored by
an accommodation at Lucca, as the parties found
it necessary to preserve a good understanding
with each other.

The terms of this accommodation were; that C&aelig;sar should
have his government prolonged for another five years; and that
Pompey and Crassus should enjoy the consulship for the ensuing[Pg 390]
year, the former receiving the provinces of Spain and Africa;
and the latter that of Syria, for the purpose of carrying on a war
against the Parthians. In proportion as these conditions were
kept secret, there remained less secrecy respecting the alliance
itself.

Second
consulate of
Pompey
and Crassus,
55.

32. Second consulate of Pompey and Crassus.
It was only amidst violent storms that they could
effect their purposes; as it depended upon which
faction should first gain or keep possession of the
forum. The resistance they met with from the
inflexible disposition of Cato, who in his austere
virtue alone found means to secure himself a
powerful party, shows how unfairly those judge
who consider the power of the triumvirate as unlimited,
and the nation as entirely corrupted.

Campaign of Crassus against the Parthians, undertaken at his
own expense, 54. Instead, however, of gathering laurels like
C&aelig;sar, he and his whole army were completely overthrown in
Mesopotamia, 53; and the Parthians from this time maintain a
powerful preponderance in Asia (see above, p. 302).

Pompey
aspires to
become
head of the
republic;

33. As the triumvirate by this failure of Crassus
was reduced to a duumvirate, Pompey (who remained
in Rome, and governed his provinces by
lieutenants), in the midst of continual domestic
broils, which he cunningly took care to foment,
was evidently aiming to become the acknowledged
head of the senate and republic. The
idea that a dictator was necessary prevailed more and more
53.
during an anarchy of eight months, in
which no appointment of a consul could take
place; and notwithstanding the opposition of
Cato, Pompey succeeded, after a violent commotion,
in which Clodius was murdered by Milo, in
getting himself nominated
is appointed sole consul, 52.
sole consul; a power
equal to that of dictator.[Pg 391]

Consulate of Pompey, 52, in which, at the end of seven months,
he took as colleague his father-in-law Metellus Scipio. The government
of his provinces, which afterwards became the chief
seat of the republicans, is prolonged for five years.

Civil war
inevitable.

34. From this time civil war became inevitable;
for not only the chiefs of the parties, but
also their adherents desired it. The approach of
the time when C&aelig;sar's command would expire,
necessarily hastened the crisis. Could it be supposed
that the conqueror of Gaul would return
to a private life, and leave his rival at the head of
the republic? The steps taken on both sides
towards an accommodation were only made to
escape the odium which would attach to him who
struck the first blow. But Pompey unfortunately
could never understand his opponent, who did all
himself, all completely, and all alone. The brilliant
light in which Pompey now appeared, as
defender of the republic, delighted him so much,
that it made him forget what belonged to its defence;
while C&aelig;sar avoided, with the greatest
care, every appearance of usurpation. The friend,
the protector of the people against the usurpations
of their enemies, was the character which
he now chose to assume.

Commencement of the contest upon C&aelig;sar's demand to be
allowed to hold the consulship while absent, 52. C&aelig;sar, by the
most lavish corruption, had increased his adherents in Rome,
gained the tribunes, and among them especially the powerful
speaker C. Curio (whom he did not think too dearly purchased
at the price of about half a million sterling); by this man it was
suggested to C&aelig;sar that he should give up his command, and
leave a successor to be appointed in his place, 51, if Pompey
would do the same: a proposition which created a prejudice
much in his favour. Repeated, but insincere offers of both parties
for an accommodation, 50, till at last a decree of the senate[Pg 392]
was passed, Jan. 7, 49, by which C&aelig;sar was commanded "to
disband his army under the penalty of being declared an enemy
to the republic," without regard to the intercessions of the tribunes,
whose flight to him gave an appearance of popularity to his
party. C&aelig;sar crosses the Rubicon, the boundary of his province.

Civil war
between
C&aelig;sar and
Pompey.

35. The civil war now about to break out,
seemed likely to spread over nearly all the countries
of the Roman empire; as Pompey, finding
it impossible to maintain himself in Italy, had
chosen Greece for the principal theatre of the
war; while his lieutenants, with the armies under
their command, occupied Spain and Africa.
C&aelig;sar, by the able disposition of his legions, was
everywhere present, without exciting beforehand
any suspicion of his movements. A combination
of circumstances, however, carried the war into
Alexandria, and even as far as Pontus; indeed it
might be called rather a series of six successive
wars than merely one, all of which C&aelig;sar, by
flying with his legions from one quarter of the
world to the other, ended, within five years, victoriously
and in person.

Rapid occupation of Italy in sixty days (when the troops
under Domitius surrendered at Corfinus), which, as well as
Sicily and Sardinia, were subdued by C&aelig;sar almost without opposition;
Pompey, with his troops and adherents, having crossed
over to Greece. C&aelig;sar's first campaign in Spain against Pompey's
generals, Afranius and Petreius, whom he forces to surrender;
this, however, is counterbalanced by the loss of the legions under
Curio in Africa. In December, 49, however, C&aelig;sar is again in
Italy, and named dictator, which he exchanges for the consulate.
Spirited expedition into Greece with the ships he had been previously
collecting together, Jan. 4, 49. Unfortunate engagement
at Dyrrachium. Removal of the war into Thessaly, and decisive
battle of Pharsalia, July 20, 48, after which Pompey flies to
Alexandria, where he is killed on his landing. C&aelig;sar arrives
three days after him at Alexandria.[Pg 393]

C&aelig;sar again
dictator.

36. C&aelig;sar, after the victory of Pharsalia, again
nominated dictator, with great privileges. The
death of Pompey, however, does not destroy his
party; and the six months' war of Alexandria,
as well as the expedition into Pontus against
Pharnaces, gave them time to rally their forces
both in Africa under Cato, and in Spain under
the sons of Pompey.

During the Alexandrine war (see above, p. 266) and the expedition
against Pharnaces, the son of Mithridates,&mdash;who had
obtained the kingdom of his father, but was slain by C&aelig;sar immediately
after his arrival, 47,&mdash;great disorders had broken out
in Rome, caused by the tribune Dolabella's flattering the people
with the abolition of debts (nov&aelig; tabul&aelig;), notwithstanding the
military power of M. Antony, whom C&aelig;sar had sent to Rome as
master of the horse (magister equitum), as this abandoned sensualist
at first actually favoured the projects of the tribune.
C&aelig;sar's return to Rome, December, 47, put an end, it is true, to
these disorders; but the increase of the opposite party in Africa,
and an insurrection among his soldiers, obliged him to set out
for Africa immediately, January, 46. Victory near Thapsus
over Scipio and Juba; after which Cato kills himself at Utica.
Numidia, the kingdom of Juba, becomes a Roman province.
C&aelig;sar after his return to Rome in June, is only able to stay
there four months, as, before the end of the year, he is obliged to
set out for Spain to crush the dangerous efforts of Pompey's two
sons. Bloody battle at Munda, March, 45, after which Cneius is
killed, but Sextus escapes to the Celtiberians.

Enquiry into
the views
of C&aelig;sar.

37. Nothing seems more evident than that
C&aelig;sar did not, like Sylla, overthrow the republic
for the purpose of reestablishing it; and it is
perhaps impossible to say what could be the final
views of a childless usurper, who throughout his
whole career, seemed only to be guided by an inordinate
ambition, springing from a consciousness
of superior powers, and to satisfy which, no means
seemed to him difficult or unlawful. The period[Pg 394]
of his dictatorship was so short, and so much interrupted
by war, that his ultimate plans had not
time for their development. He endeavoured to
establish his dominion by popular measures; and
although his army must still have been his main
support, yet no proscription was granted to satisfy
it. The reestablishment of order in the distracted
country of Italy, and particularly in the
capital, was his first care; and he proposed to
follow that by an expedition against the powerful
Parthian empire. His attempts, however, to obtain
the diadem, seemed to place it beyond a
doubt that he wished to introduce a formal monarchy.
But the destruction of the form of the
republic was shown to be more dangerous than
the overthrow of the republic itself.

The following were the honours and privileges granted to
C&aelig;sar by the senate. After the battle of Pharsalia, 48, he was
nominated dictator for one year and consul for five years; and
obtained the potestas tribunicia, as well as the right of making
war and peace, the exclusive right of the committees, with the
exception of the tribunes, and the possession of the provinces.
The dictatorship was renewed to him, 47, for ten years, as well
as the pr&aelig;fectura morum, and was at last, 145, conferred upon
him for ever, with the title of imperator. Although C&aelig;sar thus
became absolute master of the republic, it appears to have been
done without laying aside the republican forms.

His Death, March 15.

38. Conspiracy against C&aelig;sar, formed by Brutus
and Cassius, and terminating in the death of
C&aelig;sar. Men so exalted as were the chiefs of
this plot, easily understand one another; and it
was quite in accordance with their character not
to meditate upon the consequences of their deed.
C&aelig;sar's death was a great misfortune for Rome.
Experience soon showed that the republic could[Pg 395]
not be reestablished thereby; and his life might
probably have spared the state some of those calamities
which now, by its change to a monarchy,
became unavoidable.

We still want a discriminating life of C&aelig;sar, who in modern
times has been as extravagantly praised as Alexander has been
unjustly censured. As generals and conquerors, both were
equally great&mdash;and little; as a man, however, the Macedonian,
in the brilliant period of his life, to which C&aelig;sar never attained,
was superior; to the great political ideas which developed themselves
in Alexander, we know of none corresponding in C&aelig;sar;
who knew better than any how to attain dominion, but little of
preserving it.

S&ouml;ltl. A short biography, judiciously executed.

Amnesty
declared;
but not approved
by
Antony and
Lepidus.

39. Notwithstanding the amnesty at first declared,
the funeral obsequies of C&aelig;sar soon
showed, that peace was of all things the least
desired by his generals, M. Antony and M. Lepidus,
now become the head of his party; and the
arrival of C&aelig;sar's nephew, C. Octavius (afterwards
C&aelig;sar Octavianus), whom he had adopted
in his will, rendered affairs still more complicated,
as every one strove for himself; Antony's particular
object being to raise himself into C&aelig;sar's
place. However earnestly they sought to gain
the people, it was in fact the legions who decided,
and the command of them depended, for
the most part, upon the possession of the provinces.
We cannot therefore wonder, that while
they sought to revenge the murder of C&aelig;sar, this[Pg 396]
became the chief cause of the struggle, and in a
few months led to a civil war.

At the time of C&aelig;sar's death, M. Antonius was actual consul,
and Dolabella consul-elect; M. Lepidus magister equitum (master
of the horse); M. Brutus and Cassius, pr&aelig;tors (the first,
pr&aelig;tor urbanus). C&aelig;sar had given to the former the province
of Macedonia, and to the latter that of Syria, which had been
confirmed to them by the senate. M. Lepidus had been nominated
to Transalpine, and D. Brutus to Cisalpine Gaul. But
soon after the murder of C&aelig;sar, Antony obtained, by a decree
of the people, Macedonia for himself, and Syria for his colleague
Dolabella, with whom he had formed a close connection; instead
of which the senate decreed to Cassius Cyrene, and to Brutus,
who now had the important charge of supplying Rome with
provisions, Crete. But soon after (June 1, 44), Antony desired,
by a new change, to obtain Cisalpine Gaul for himself, and
Macedonia for his brother C. Antony, both of which he procured
from the people.

Antony endeavours
to
establish
himself in
Cisalpine
Gaul.

40. As M. Antony sought by force to establish
himself in Cisalpine Gaul, and D. Brutus refused
to give it up to him, and retired into Mutina, a
short, indeed, but very bloody civil war arose,
(bellum mutinense.) The eloquence of Cicero had
caused Antony to be declared an enemy of the
republic; and the two new consuls, Hirtius and
Pansa, together with C&aelig;sar Octavianus, were
sent against him. The defeat of Antony compelled
him to seek refuge beyond the Alps with
Lepidus; but the two consuls being slain, Octavianus
at the head of his legions was too importunate
to be refused the consulship, and soon
convinced the defenceless senate, how impossible
it was to reestablish the commonwealth by their
powerless decrees. The employment, moreover,
of the magistratus suffecti, which soon after arose,
was in itself a sufficient proof that it was now no[Pg 397]
more than the shadow of what it had formerly
been.

The Mutine war begins in December, 44, and closes with the
defeat of Antony at Mutina, April 14, 43. Octavius obtains the
consulate, Sept. 22.

Formation
of a triumvirate
by C.
Octavianus,
M. Antony,
and Lepidus.

41. Octavianus, deserting the party of the
senate, enters into a secret negotiation with Antony
and Lepidus; the consequence of which is
a meeting of the parties at Bononia, and the formation
of a new triumvirate. They declare
themselves the chiefs of the republic for five
years, under the title of triumviri reipublic&aelig; constituend&aelig;;
and dividing the provinces among themselves
according to their own pleasure, they make
the destruction of the republican party their principal
object. A new proscription in Rome itself,
and a declaration of war against the murderers of
C&aelig;sar, were the means by which they proposed
to effect it.

The agreement of the triumvirate was concluded Nov. 27, 43,
after which the march of the triumvirs upon Rome gives the
signal for the massacre of the proscribed, which soon extends all
over Italy, and in which Cicero perishes, Dec. 7. The cause of
this new proscription was not party hatred alone, but was as
much, perhaps more, owing on the one hand to the want of
money for carrying on the war they had undertaken, and on the
other to a desire of satisfying the turbulent demands of the legions.
Where is to be found a time so full of terror as this, when
even tears were forbidden?

Civil war
between the
oligarchy
and republicans.

42. The civil war, now on the eve of breaking
out, may be considered therefore as a war between
the oligarchy and the defenders of the
republic. The Roman world was, as it were,
divided between the two; and although the former
had possession of Italy, and the western pro[Pg 398]vinces,
that advantage seemed counterbalanced to
the chiefs of the opposite party by the possession
of the eastern countries, and the naval power of
Sextus Pompey, which seemed to assure them
the dominion of the sea.

M. Brutus had taken possession of his province of Macedonia
as early as the autumn of 44; while Cassius, on the contrary,
had to contend for that of Syria with Dolabella, who by the
murder of the proconsul Trebonius had possessed himself of Asia.
Being, however, for this offence, declared an enemy by the
senate, and shut up in Laodicea by Cassius, he killed himself,
June 5, 43. From this time Brutus and Cassius were masters
of all the eastern provinces, at whose expense they maintained
their troops, though not without much oppression. S. Pompey,
after the victory of Munda, 45, having secreted himself in Spain,
and afterwards become a chief of freebooters, had grown very
powerful; when the senate, after C&aelig;sar's assassination, having
made him commander of the sea-forces, he with them took possession
of Spain, and, after the conclusion of the triumvirate, of
Sicily, and then, very soon after, of Sardinia and Corsica. It was
a great thing for the triumvirate, that C. Pompey did not know
how to reap half the profit he might have done from his power
and good fortune.

Its seat in
Macedonia.

43. Macedonia became the theatre of the new
civil war, and together with the goodness of their
cause, superior talents, and greater power both
by land and sea, seemed combined to ensure the
victory to Brutus and Cassius. But in the decisive
battle at Philippi, fortune played one of her
most capricious tricks, and with the two chiefs
fell the last supporters of the republic.

Double battle at Philippi towards the close of the year 42;
voluntary death of Cassius after the first, and of Brutus after the
second engagement.

[Pg 399]
Quarrels of
the oligarchy
among
themselves.


44. The history of the eleven years intervening
between the battle of Philippi and that of Actium,
is little more than an account of the quarrels
of the oligarchy among themselves. The most
subtle was, in the end, victorious; for M. Antony
possessed all the sensuality of C&aelig;sar, without
his genius: and the insignificant Lepidus
soon fell a sacrifice to his own vanity and weakness.
While Antony went into Asia to arrange
the affairs of the eastern provinces, and from
thence with Cleopatra to Alexandria, Octavianus
returned to Rome. But the famine which then
reigned in that city through Pompey's blockade
of the seacoast; the misery spread throughout
Italy by the wresting of patrimonial lands from
the proprietors to distribute among the veterans;
and the insatiable covetousness of the latter rendered
his situation as dangerous now as it had
Fulvia causes a civil war;
been before the war. Besides all this, the hatred
of the enraged consort of Antony, who had entered
into an alliance with her brother-in-law, the
consul L. Antony, brought on, towards the end
of the year, a civil war, which ended with the
surrender and burning of Perusium, in which L.
Antony had shut himself up, and which was
already much weakened by famine.

The bellum Perusinum lasted from the end of the year 41 till
April, 40.

40.

45. This war, however, had nearly led to one
still greater; for M. Antony, as the enemy of
Octavianus, had come to Italy in order to assist
his brother, and with the intention of forming an
alliance with S. Pompey against the former. But
fortunately for the world, not only was harmony[Pg 400]
restored between the triumvirs, but on account of
the great famine which prevailed at Rome, a
peace was also concluded with Pompey, although
it lasted but a very short time.

The principal object of the peace between the triumvirs was a
new division of the provinces, by which the city of Scodra in
Illyria was fixed upon as the boundary. Antony obtained all the
eastern provinces; Octavianus all the western; and Lepidus
Africa. Italy remained in common to them all. The marriage
of Antony with Octavia, Fulvia being dead, was intended to cement
this agreement. In the peace concluded with S. Pompey
at Misenum, he obtained the islands of Sicily, Sardinia, and Corsica,
and the promise of Achaia.

Pompey recommences
the war;

destruction,

46. Pompey, however, was not long in finding
that an alliance between him and the triumvirs
would only end in his own destruction; and the
war which he soon commenced, and which Octavianus
could not bring to a close but with the
assistance of Agrippa, was of so much the more
importance, as it not only decided the fate of
Pompey, but by leading to dissensions, and the
expulsion of Lepidus, reduced the triumvirate to
a duumvirate.

After a doubtful engagement at sea, 38, and the formation of
a new fleet, Pompey was attacked on all sides at the same time;
Lepidus coming from Africa, and Antony sending also some
ships. Final overthrow of Pompey, who flies to Asia and there
perishes.&mdash;Lepidus wishing to take possession of Sicily, Octavianus

wars prevent

and Antony

rupture.

35&mdash;33.

Rome
and
divorces
Octavia, 32.

47. The foreign wars in which Octavianus as
well as Antony were engaged in the following
years, prevented for some time their mutual
jealousy from coming to an open rupture. Octavianus,
to tame his unruly legions, employed them
[Pg 401]with some success against the nations of Dalmatia
and Pannonia; whilst Antony undertook an expedition
against the powerful Parthians and their
neighbours. But in offending Rome by his conduct
in these wars, he only armed his opponent
against himself; and his formal separation from
Octavia, loosened the only tie which had hitherto
held together the two masters of the world.

After his first stay in Alexandria, 41, Antony returned to Italy,
40, and then, having made peace with Octavianus, he carried his
new wife Octavia with him into Greece, where he remained till
the year 37. Although his lieutenant Ventidius had fought with
success against the Parthians, who had invaded Syria (see
above, p. 302.), Antony determined to undertake an expedition
against them himself, 36. But although in alliance with
Artavasdes king of Armenia (whom he soon after accused of
treachery), in seeking to effect an entrance into Parthia, by
passing through Armenia and Media, a different route from that
taken by Crassus, he was very nearly meeting with the same
fate, and the expedition completely failed. He then revenged
himself upon Artavasdes, who fell into his hands in a fresh expedition
which he made, 34, and deprived him of his kingdom.
After his triumphal entrance into Alexandria, he made a grant
of this as well as other countries to Cleopatra and her children.
(See above, p. 267.) In 33, he intended to renew his expedition
against the Parthians, in alliance with the king of Media; but
having, at the instigation of Cleopatra, ordered Octavia to return
home, when she had already come as far as Athens on her way to
meet him, Octavianus and Antony reciprocally accused each other
before the senate, and war was declared at Rome, though only
against Cleopatra.

Greece the
seat of war
between
Antony and
Octavianus.

Antony defeated at Actium, 2d. Sept. 31;

his death, 30,
leaves Octavianus
without a
rival.

48. Greece became again the theatre of war;
and although the forces of Antony were most
considerable, yet Octavianus had the advantage
of having, at least in appearance, the better
cause. The naval victory of Actium decided for
Octavianus, who could scarcely believe it, till he
[Pg 402]found that Antony had forsaken his fleet and
army, the latter of which surrendered without
striking a blow. The capture of Egypt followed,
(see above, p. 267.) and that country was reduced
to a Roman province; the death of Antony and
Cleopatra ended the war, and left Octavianus
absolute master of the republic.

The history of the last days of Antony, principally after his
decline, having been written under the rule of his enemies, must
be received with that mistrust which all such histories require.
It has furnished abundant matter for the retailers of anecdote.
The history of Cleopatra rests partly on the accounts of her physician
Olympus, of which Plutarch made use.

on the south the Rhodanus as far as Lugdunum,
so that it comprised at first the countries bordering
on the Rhine and Helvetia. The latter,
however, were afterwards separated from it under
the names of Germania Inferior and Superior.
Principal tribes: Nervii, Bellovaci, etc. in the
north, of Belgic origin; Treviri, Ubii, of Ger[Pg 405]man
origin; Sequani, Helvetii, in the interior,
of Celtic origin. Principal towns: Vesentio
(Besan&ccedil;on), Verodunum (Verdun), etc. Along
the Rhine in Germania Inferior: Colonia Agrippina
(Cologne). In Germania Superior: Mogontiacum
(Mayence, or Mentz), and Argentoratum
(Strasburg).

Cisalpine
Gaul.

III. Gallia Cisalpina, or Togata (Lombardy,
see above, p. 315). But as from the time of
C&aelig;sar the inhabitants enjoyed all the privileges
of Roman citizens, it may be reckoned as forming
part of Italy.

Sicily.

IV. Sicilia; divided into Syracuse and Lilyb&aelig;um.

Sardinia,
Corsica.

V. Sardinia and Corsica, see above, p. 320.

British
islands.

VI. The Insul&aelig; Britannic&aelig; (British islands);
but of these, only England and the southern part
of Scotland were reduced into a Roman province
in the time of Nero, under the name of Britannia
Romana. Principal rivers: Tamesis (Thames)
and Sabrina (Severn). Cities: Eboracum (York)
in the north, Londinum (London) in the south.
Into Scotland, Britannia Barbaria, or Caledonia,
the Romans often penetrated, but without being
ably completely to conquer it; and as for Hibernia,
Ierne (Ireland), it was visited by Roman
merchants, but never by Roman legions.

Countries
south of the
Danube:
Vindelicia.

VII.  The countries south of the Danube,
which were subdued under Augustus and formed
into the following provinces: 1. Vindelicia.
Boundaries: on the north the Danube, on the
east the &AElig;nus (Inn), on the west Helvetia, on
the south Rh&aelig;tia. Principal tribes: Vindelici,

Cebrus, on the south mount H&aelig;mus (the Balkan),
and on the east the Pontus Euxinus. Cities:
Odessus (Varna), Tomi (Tomisvar).

Illyricum.

VIII. Illyricum, in its most extensive signification,
comprised all the provinces south of the
Danube, together with Rh&aelig;tia and Dalmatia:
but Illyricum Proper comprehends only the lands
along the coast of the Adriatic, from Rh&aelig;tia in[Pg 407]
Italy to the river Drinus, and easterly to the
Savus. Principal towns: Salona, Epidaurus
(near the present Ragusa), Scodra (Scutari).

mountains, on the west the Adriatic, and on the
east the &AElig;gean sea. Rivers: the Nestus, Strymon,
and Halyacmon, which fall into the &AElig;gean

towns: Pydna, Pella, Thessalonica, Philippi,
with other Greek colonies (see above, p. 164).
Dyrrachium and Apollonia on the western coast.

Thrace.

X.  Thrace had for some time kings of her own,
though dependent on Rome, and was first reduced
to a Roman province under Claudius.

east the Hierasus (Pruth), in the north the
Carpathian mountains. Principal tribe: Daci.
Chief cities; Ulpia Trajana and Tibiscum.

Asiatic
provinces.
Asia Minor.

Asiatic provinces: I. Asia Minor contained
the provinces: 1. Asia (see above, p. 293).
2. Bithynia, together with Paphlagonia and part
of Pontus. 3. Cilicia, with Pisidia (see above,
[Pg 408]p. 18.)
Syria. Isle of Cyprus.
II. Syria and Ph&#339;nicia. III. The isle
of Cyprus.  Several other states, likewise dependent,
still preserved their kings: as, Jud&aelig;a
(became a Roman province, A. D. 44.), Commagene
(province A. D. 70, and, together with
Jud&aelig;a, added to Syria), Cappadocia (province
A. D. 17), Pontus (completely a province under Nero).
Free states.
Free states at this time: Rhodes, Samos
(provinces A. D. 70), and Lycia (province A. D.
43). Beyond the Euphrates, Armenia and Mesopotamia
were reduced to provinces by Trajan,
but, as early as the time of Adrian, were abandoned.

African
provinces.
Egypt.
Cyrenaica.
Africa.
Mauritania.

African provinces. I. Egypt. II. Cyrenaica,
with the isle of Crete. III. Africa, Numidia
(see above, p. 47). Mauritania still had
its separate king, but he was set aside, A. D. 41,
and the country divided into two provinces:
1.  Mauritania C&aelig;sariensis. Boundaries: on the
east the river Ampsaga, on the west the Mulucha.
Principal places: Igilgilis and C&aelig;saria.
2.  Mauritania Tingitana, from the river Mulucha
to the Atlantic ocean. Capital: Tingis.

States on
the borders.
Germany.

Principal states on the borders of the empire:
I. Germania. Boundaries: on the south the Danube,
on the north the sea, on the west the Rhine,
on the east undetermined, though the Vistula is
generally regarded as such. Principal rivers:
the Danubius, Rhenus (Rhine), Albis (Elbe),
Visurgis (Weser), Viadrus (Oder), and the Vistula;
the Lupias (Lippe) and Amisia (Ems) are
likewise frequently mentioned. Mountains and
forests: the Hercynian forest, a general name for
the forest mountains, particularly of eastern Ger[Pg 409]many.
Melibocus (the Hartz), Sudetus (the
Thuringian forest); the forest of Teutoburg, to
the south of Westphalia, etc. It would be useless
to seek for a general political division, or for
the cities, of ancient Germany; we can only
point out the situation of the principal tribes. It
is necessary, however, to precede this by two
observations: 1. The same territory, in the tide of
forcible emigration and conquest, and particularly
after the second century, often changed its inhabitants.
2. The names of some of the principal
tribes often became that of a confederacy. The
principal tribes in the period of Augustus were,
in northern Germany; the Batavi in Holland;
the Frisii in Friesland; the Bructeri in Westphalia;
the lesser and larger Chauci in Oldenburg
and Bremen; the Cherusci, likewise the
name of a confederation, in Brunswick; the Catti
in Hesse. In southern (central) Germany: the
Hermunduri in Franconia; the Marcomanni in Bohemia.
Alemanni.
The Alemanni, not the name of a
single tribe, but of a confederation, are first mentioned
in the third century: in the period of
Augustus these tribes, and the principal of those
of eastern Germany, which gradually became
known, were included under the general name of
Suevi.
Suevi.

Scandinavia.

The northernmost countries of Europe were
considered as isles of the German ocean, and
therefore regarded as belonging to Germany.
They were Scandinavia, or Scandia (southern
Sweden), Nerigon (Norway), and Eningia, or
probably Finningia (Finland). The northernmost
island was called Thule.[Pg 410]

Sarmatia.

The north of Europe, from the Vistula to the
Tanais (Don), was comprised under the general
name of Sarmatia; but beyond the territory
about the Danube, and especially Dacia (see
above, p. 407), they were only in a slight degree
acquainted with the coast of the Baltic, by the
amber trade.

Parthia.

In Asia the Roman empire was bounded by
Great Armenia (see above, p. 19, and 299), the
Parthian empire from the Euphrates to the Indus
(see above, p. 19&mdash;22), and the peninsula of
Arabia (see above, p. 19).

India.

Eastern Asia, or India, became known to the
Romans by a commercial intercourse carried
on between them, and which began soon after
the conquest of Egypt. It was divided into
India on this side the Ganges, that is: 1. The
territory between the Indus and Ganges; 2. The
peninsula on this side, the western coast of which
in particular (Malabar), was very well known;
and, 3. The island of Taprobana (Ceylon),
and India beyond the Ganges, to which also the
distant Serica belonged: but of all these countries
they had but a very imperfect knowledge.

Africa.

The boundaries of Africa were &AElig;thiopia above
Egypt, and G&aelig;tulia and the great sandy desert
of Libya, above the other provinces.

FIRST SECTION.

From Augustus C&aelig;sar to the death of Commodus,
B. C. 30. A. C. 193.

Sources. For the whole of this period Dion Cassius,
lib. li&mdash;lxxx, is our historian; though of his last twenty books
we have only the abridgment of Xiphilinus. For the history
of the emperors from Tiberius to the beginning of Vespasian's
reign, the principal writer is Tacitus, in his Annals, A. C.
14&mdash;63; (of which, however, part of the history of Tiberius,
32&mdash;34, all of Caligula and the first six years of Claudius, 37&mdash;47,
as well as the last year and a half of Nero, are unfortunately
lost); and in his History, of which scarcely the first three years,
69&mdash;71, are come down to us. Suetonius's Lives of the C&aelig;sars,
down to Domitian, are so much the more valuable, because
in a state like the Roman it becomes of importance to know the
character and domestic life of the ruling men. For the reigns of
Augustus and Tiberius the History of Velleius Paterculus
is not of less consequence, although written in a court-like tone.
The sources for the history of the separate C&aelig;sars will be given
as we come to them.

The following are the labours of modern writers:

Augustus
C&aelig;sar
B. C. 30&mdash;A.
C. 14.

1. Octavianus C&aelig;sar, on whom the senate
conferred the honourable title of Augustus, which
they periodically renewed, and which descended
to his successors, possessed the sole dominion
of the empire during forty-four years. The
government, notwithstanding the great revolutions
by which the republic had been converted
into a monarchy, was not yet, either in fact or
in form, altogether a despotic one. The private
interest of the ruler required that the republican
form should be preserved to the utmost, as without
that he could not make an entire change;
and the rest of his history sufficiently shows,
that the cruelty with which he may be reproached
in the early part of his career, was
rather owing to circumstances than to his natural
disposition. But during a reign so long, so
tranquil, and so fortunate, could it be otherwise
than that the republican spirit which at the beginning
existed only in a few individuals, should
evaporate of itself!

The forms under which Augustus held the different branches
of supreme power (dictatorship excepted) were;&mdash;the consulate,
which, till B. C. 21, was annually renewed; and the potestas
consularis, which, in B. C. 19, was settled on him for ever;&mdash;the
tribunicia potestas, which was, 30, granted him for ever,
rendered his person sacred (sacrosancta), and prepared the way
to the judicia majestatis (accusations of high treason). As imperator,
31, he continued commander of all the forces, and obtained
the imperium proconsulare (proconsular power) in all the
provinces. He assumed the magistratura morum (censorship),
19; and became pontifex maximus (high priest), 13. To avoid[Pg 413]
all appearances of usurpation, Augustus at first accepted the
sovereign power only for ten years, and afterwards had it renewed
from time to time, for ten or five years, which, at a later
period, gave rise to the sacra decennalia.

The senate.

2. The senate, indeed, remained a permanent
council of state, and Augustus himself endeavoured
to increase its authority by more than one
purification (lectio); but the connection between
him and that assembly seemed of a very fragile
nature, as it was undetermined, and could not at
this time be settled, whether Augustus was over
the senate, or the senate over Augustus. All
matters of state could not be brought before the
senate, as even the most important often required
secrecy. It naturally followed, that a prince,
as yet without a court, and who had no proper
minister, but only his friends and freedmen,
should consult with those whom he thought most
worthy his confidence, a M&aelig;cenas, or an Agrippa,
etc. Hence afterwards was formed the secret
council of state (consilium secretum principis).
Among the republican magistrates the highest
lost most; and as so much now depended upon
the preservation of peace in the capital, the offices
of pr&aelig;fect of the city (pr&aelig;fectus urbis) and pr&aelig;fect
of provisions (pr&aelig;fectus annon&aelig;) were not only
made permanent, but became, especially the
former, the principal offices in the state.

The spirit of monarchy shows itself in nothing more than in its
strict distinction of ranks; hence, therefore, the magistrates,
especially the consuls, lost nothing. Hence also the long-continued
custom of nominating under-consuls (consules suffecti,)
which in time became merely a formal assumption of the ornamenta
consularia et triumphalia (consular and triumphal ornaments).
Other offices were created for the purpose of rewarding
friends and dependents.[Pg 414]

Introduction
of
standing
armies.

3.  The introduction of standing armies, already
long prepared, naturally followed a dominion acquired
by war; and became, indeed, necessary
to guard the frontiers and preserve the newly-made
conquests; the establishment of the guards
and militia of the city (cohortes pr&aelig;torian&aelig; and
cohortes urban&aelig;) were measures equally necessary
for the security of the capital and the throne.
The creation of two pr&aelig;torian pr&aelig;fects, however,
instead of one, diminished for the present the
great importance of that office.

Distribution of the legions over the provinces in castra stativa
(fixed camps), which soon grew into cities, especially along the
Rhine, the Danube, and the Euphrates (legiones Germanic&aelig;,
Illyric&aelig;, et Syriac&aelig;). Fleets also were stationed at Misenum
and Ravenna.

The provinces
divided
between
the
emperor
and the
senate.

4.  The government, as well as the administration
and revenue of the provinces, Augustus willingly
divided with the senate; keeping to himself
those on the frontiers (provinci&aelig; principis,) in
which the legions were quartered, and leaving
to that assembly the others (provinci&aelig; senat&ucirc;s).
Hence his deputies (legati, lieutenants) exercised
both civil and military authority in his name;
while those of the senate, on the contrary (proconsules),
only administered in civil affairs. Both
were, in general, attended by commissioners (procuratores
et qu&aelig;stores). The provinces were unquestionably
gainers by this new arrangement,
not only because their governors were more carefully
looked after, but because they were paid by
the state.

The fate of the provinces naturally depended, in a great degree,
upon the disposition of the emperor and governor; but there was
also an essential difference between the provinces of the emperor[Pg 415]
and those of the senate (provinci&aelig; principis et senat&ucirc;s): in the
latter there was no military oppression as there was in the former;
and to that may be ascribed the flourishing state of Gaul,
Spain, Africa, etc.

Finances:

the private and military chest of the emperor; the state chest

swallowed up by the former.

5. There is little doubt but that the finances
of the treasury remained, upon the whole, much
the same as before; but in its internal administration
Augustus made many alterations, of which
we have but a very imperfect knowledge. Of
course there would be at first an obvious difference
between the privy and military chest of the
emperor (fiscus), which was at his immediate disposal,
and the state chest (&aelig;rarium) which he
disposed of indirectly through the senate, though
it must afterwards follow as a natural consequence
of increasing despotism, that the latter
should progressively become merged in the former.

The great disorder into which the treasury had been thrown
during the civil wars, and especially by giving away the state
lands in Italy to the soldiers, together with the heavy sums required
for the maintenance of the standing army now established,
must have rendered it much more difficult for Augustus to
accomplish the reform he so happily executed; and in which it
seems to have been his chief aim to place everything, as far as
possible, upon a solid and lasting foundation. The principal
changes which he made in the old system of taxation seem to
have been: 1. That the tithes hitherto collected in the provinces
should be changed into a fixed quota, to be paid by each individual.
2. The customs, partly by reestablishing former ones, and
partly by imposing new ones as well as an excise (centesima
rerum venalium), were rendered more productive. The possession
of Egypt, which was the dep&ocirc;t of nearly all the commerce of
the east, rendered the customs at this time of great importance
to Rome. 3. All the state lands in the provinces were, by degrees,
changed into crown lands. Of the new taxes the most
considerable were the vigesima hereditatum (the twentieth of inheritances),
though with important restrictions; and the fines[Pg 416]
upon celibacy by the lex Julia Popp&aelig;a.&mdash;The greater part of
these state revenues most likely flowed, from the very first, into
the fiscus: that is, the whole revenues of the provinci&aelig; principis,
as well as of those parts of the provinci&aelig; senat&ucirc;s which were appropriated
to the maintenance of the troops; the revenues arising
from the crown domains; the vigesima, etc. To the &aelig;rarium (now
under three pr&aelig;fecti &aelig;rarii) remained a part of the revenues of
the provinci&aelig; senat&ucirc;s, the customs and the fines. Thus it appears
that Augustus was master of the finances, of the legions,
and thereby of the empire.

See above, p. 362, the writings of Hegewisch and Bosse.

Extension
of the empire:

Spain and Gaul, 25.

20.

Countries south of the Danube, 15&mdash;35.

29.

24.

6. The extension of the Roman empire under
Augustus was very considerable; being generally
of such a nature as conduced to the security
of the interior, and to the safeguard of the
frontiers. The complete subjugation of northern
Spain, and western Gaul, secured the frontiers
on that side; as did the threatened but never-executed
expedition against the Parthians, and
the one actually undertaken against Armenia,
A. C. 2. But the most important conquest in
this quarter was that of the countries south of the
Danube, viz. Rh&aelig;tia, Vindelicia, and Noricum, as
well as Pannonia, and afterwards M&#339;sia.  To
counterbalance these, the expedition against Arabia
Felix completely failed; and that against
&AElig;thiopia was of no further consequence than to
strengthen the frontiers.


7. All these conquests together, however, did
not cost the Romans so much as their fruitless
attempt to subjugate Germany, first, by the sons-in-law
of Augustus, Drusus and Tiberius Nero,
and afterwards by the son of the former, Drusus
Unsuccessful attempt to subdue Germany.
Germanicus. Whether or not this undertaking
was a political fault, must always remain a problem,
as it is now impossible to say how far[Pg 417]
the security of the frontiers could be preserved
without it.

Rome commenced her hostile attack upon Germany under
the command of Drusus, B. C. 12; Lower Germany (Westphalia,
Lower Saxony, and Hesse) being in general the theatre of the
war: while the Lower Rhine was attacked both by sea and land
at the mouths of the Ems, the Weser, and the Elbe, on account
of the great assistance afforded the Romans by their alliance with
the nations on the coasts, the Batavi, Frisii, and Chauci. The
intrepid Drusus, in his second expedition, 10, penetrated as far
as the Weser, and, 9, even as far as the Elbe, but died on his
return. His successors in the command (Tiberius, 9&mdash;7, Domitius,
&AElig;nobarbus, 7&mdash;2, M. Vinicius, 2&mdash;A. C. 2, then again Tiberius,
A. C. 2&mdash;4, who was followed by Quintilius Varus, A. C.
5&mdash;9,) endeavoured to build on the foundation laid by Drusus,
and, by erecting forts and introducing the Roman language and
laws, gradually to reduce into a province the part of Germany
they had already subdued; but the craftily organized revolt of
the young Arminius (Hermann,) a prince of the Cherusci, son
of Siegmar, and son-in-law of Segestes, a friend of the Romans,
together with the defeat of Varus and his army in the Teutoburg
wald, or forest, near Paderborn, A. C. 9, rescued Germany
from slavery, and its language from annihilation. It moreover
taught the conquerors (what they never forgot) that the legions
were not invincible. Augustus immediately despatched Tiberius,
who had just quelled a furious insurrection in Pannonia, together
with Germanicus, to the Rhine; but these confined themselves
to simple incursions, till Germanicus, A. C. 14&mdash;16, again
carried his arms further into the country, and certainly penetrated
as far as the Weser. Yet, notwithstanding his victory
near Idistavisus (Minden), the loss of his fleet and part of his
army by a tempest on his return, and the jealousy of Tiberius at
his victory, obliged him to give up his command. From this
time the Germans were left at rest in this quarter.

Reign of
Augustus, a
brilliant
period for
Rome.

8. The long, and for Italy itself, peaceable
reign of Augustus, has generally been considered
a fortunate and brilliant period of Roman history;
and, when compared with the times which pre[Pg 418]ceded
and followed, it certainly was so. Security
of person and property were reestablished;
the arts of peace flourished under the benign patronage
of Augustus and his favourite M&aelig;cenas;
and we may add, that, as the formal restoration of
the republic would only have been the signal for
new commotions, the government of Augustus, if
not the very best, was, at least, the best that
Rome could then bear. Should it be said his
private life was not blameless, it may be replied,
that he inflexibly maintained an outward decency,
to which, indeed, he sacrificed his only daughter;
and if laws could have bettered the public morals,
there was no lack of decrees for that purpose.

Among his most important laws to this end are, the lex Julia
de adulteriis and the lex Papia Popp&aelig;a against celibacy. The
latter excited many murmurs.

Augustus's family.

Livia.

B. C. 23.

Julia married to Agrippa, 17.

12.

6&mdash;A. C. 9.

A. C. 2.

2&mdash;4.

Tiberius adopted by Augustus 4.

9. Nearly all that remains of the history of
Augustus, is an account of his domestic troubles;
the most unhappy family being that of the emperor.
The influence of Livia, his second wife,
was very great, but does not seem to have been
perverted to any worse purpose than raising her
sons, Tiberius and Drusus, to the throne. The
naturally unsettled state of the succession, in a
government such as that of Rome now was, became
much increased by circumstances. After
the untimely death of his nephew and son-in-law
Marcellus, whom he had adopted, his widow Julia,
the only child of Augustus by his wife Scribonia,
was married to Agrippa. The two eldest sons of
this marriage, C. and L. C&aelig;sar, were adopted,
upon the death of their father, by the emperor,
who showed so much fondness towards them as
[Pg 419]they grew up, that Tiberius, who in the mean
time had married their mother, Julia,&mdash;afterwards
banished by Augustus for her licentious conduct&mdash;left
the court in disgust. The death of the two
young princes, however, again revived the hopes
of Tiberius, who was adopted by Augustus upon
the condition that he should also adopt Drusus
Germanicus, the son of his deceased brother
Drusus; after which Augustus, with the consent
of the senate, formally associated him with himself
in the government, making him an equal
partner in the imperial privileges: called by his
successors, lex regia.

the contemporary affairs of Augustus; the others go back to
earlier times. A just appreciation of Augustus requires a previous
critical examination of the sources from which Suetonius
has drawn the materials for his biography.

August 14, 19&mdash;March 16, 37.

Changes in the constitution:

power of the comitia reduced;

despotism introduced by the judicia majestatis;

degraded character of the senate.

10. The reign of Tiberius Claudius Nero, or, as
he was called after his adoption, Augustus Tiberius
C&aelig;sar, from his fifty-sixth to his seventy-eighth
year, changed rather the spirit than the form of
the Roman constitution. He succeeded quietly to
the vacant throne at Rome, although the legions
[Pg 420]in Pannonia, and still more in Germany, felt that
they could make emperors. Under him the comitia,
or assemblies of the people, were reduced
to a mere shadow; as he transferred their duties
to the senate, which also became the highest
tribunal for the state crimes of its own members:
this assembly, however, had now been so much
accustomed to obey the will of the prince, that
everything depended on his personal character.
Tiberius founded his despotism upon the judicia
majestatis, or accusations of high treason, now
become an engine of terror, the senate also
sharing his guilt with a pusillanimity and servility
which knew no bounds. This degraded
assembly, indeed, from the moment that it ceased
to be the ruling authority of a free state, necessarily
became the passive instrument of the most
brutal tyranny.  Notwithstanding the military
talents and many good qualities of Tiberius, his
despotic character had been formed long before
his fifty-sixth year, when he mounted the throne;
although exterior circumstances prevented him
from entirely throwing off the mask which he
had hitherto worn.

The foundation of the judicia majestatis, which soon became
so terrible by the unfixed state of crime, had been laid during
the reign of Augustus by the lex Julia de majestate, and the
cognitiones extraordinari&aelig;, or commissioners appointed to take
cognizance of certain crimes; it was, however, the abuse of them
by Tiberius and his successors, which rendered them so dreadful.

Ruin of
Germanicus
and his
family.


12. The principal object of Tiberius's suspicion,
and therefore of his hate, was Germanicus, a
man almost adored by the army and the people.
This brave general he soon recalled from Ger[Pg 421]many,
and sent into Syria to quell the disorders
of the east. After having successfully put an end
to the commotions which called him there, he
A. C. 19.
was poisoned by the contrivances of Cn. Piso
and his wife; and even that did not shelter the
numerous family which he left behind, with his
widow Agrippina, from persecution and ruin.

The expeditions of Germanicus in the east not only gave a
king to Armenia, but also reduced Cappadocia and Commagene
to Roman provinces, A. C. 17.

13. Rome, however, soon experienced to her
cost the powerful ascendancy which L. &AElig;lius
Sejanus, the pr&aelig;fect of the pr&aelig;torian guard, had
acquired over the mind of Tiberius, whose unlimited
confidence he possessed the more, as he
enjoyed it without a rival. The eight years of his
authority were rendered terrible not only by the
cantonment of his troops in barracks near the
city (castra pr&aelig;toriana), but (having first persuaded
Tiberius to quit Rome for ever, that he
might more securely play the tyrant in the isle of
Capre&aelig;) by his endeavouring to open a way for
himself to the throne by villanies and crimes without
number, and by his cruel persecution of the
family of Germanicus. The despotism he had
introduced became still more dreadful by his
own fall, in which not only his whole party, but
every one that could be considered as connected
with it, became involved. The picture of the
atrocious despotism of Tiberius is rendered doubly
disgusting by the horrid and unnatural lust which
he joined to it in his old age.[Pg 422]

Tiberius's misfortune was, that he came too late to the throne.
His early virtues made no compensation for his later cruelties.
It is properly the former which Vel. Paterculus praises, whose
flattery of Tiberius, in whose reign he flourished, is more easily
justified than his praise of Sejanus.

Caligula,

14. At the age of twenty-five Caius C&aelig;sar
Caligula, the only remaining son of Germanicus,
ascended the throne; but the hopes which had
been formed of this young prince were soon
wofully disappointed. His previous sickness and
debaucheries had so distorted his understanding,
that his short reign was one tissue of disorder
and crime. Yet he did still more harm to the
state by his besotted profusion than by his tiger-like
cruelty. At length, after a career of nearly
four years, he was assassinated by Cassius
Ch&aelig;rea and Cornelius Sabinus, two officers of
his guard.

15. His uncle Tiberius Claudius C&aelig;sar, who,
at the age of fifty, succeeded him, was the first
emperor raised to the throne by the guards;
a favour which he rewarded by granting them a
donative. Too weak to rule of himself, almost
imbecile from former neglect, profligate, and cruel
from fear, he became the tool of the licentiousness
of his wives and freedmen. Coupled with
the names of Messalina and Agrippina, we now
hear, for the first time in Roman history, of a
Pallas and a Narcissus. The dominion of Messalina
was still more hurtful to the state by her
rapacious cupidity, to which everything gave
way, than by her dissolute life; and the blow
which at last punished her unexampled wantonness,
left a still more dangerous woman to supply
[Pg 423]her place. This was Agrippina, her neice, widow
of L. Domitius, who joined to the vices of her
predecessor a boundless ambition, unknown to
the former. Her chief aim was to procure the
succession for Domitius Nero, her son by a former
marriage&mdash;who had been adopted by Claudius,
and married to his daughter Octavia&mdash;by setting
aside Britannicus, the son of Claudius; and this
she hoped to effect, by poisoning Claudius, having
already gained Burrhus, by making him sole pr&aelig;fect
of the pr&aelig;torian guard. Notwithstanding
the contentions with the Germans and Parthians
(see above, p. 303) were only on the frontiers,
the boundaries of the Roman empire were in
many countries extended.

Claudius himself went) under A. Plautius, from the year A. C.

hitherto existed in Italy.

His education
and
character.


16. Nero Claudius C&aelig;sar, supported by Agrippina
and the pr&aelig;torian guard, succeeded Claudius
at the age of seventeen. Brought up in the
midst of the blackest crimes, and, by a perverted
education, formed rather for a professor of music
and the fine arts than for an emperor, he ascended
the throne like a youth eager for enjoyment; and
throughout his whole reign his cruelty appears
subordinate to his fondness for debaucheries and
revelry. The unsettled state of the succession
first called into action his savage disposition; and
after the murder of Britannicus the sword fell

in regular order upon all those who were even
[Pg 424]remotely connected with the Julian family. His
vanity as a performer and composer excited in an
equal degree his cruelty; and as, among all tyrants,
every execution gives occasion for others,
we need not wonder at his putting to death every
one that excelled him. His connection, however,
in the early part of his reign, with Agrippina,
Burrhus, and Seneca, during which he introduced
some useful regulations into the treasury, kept him
within the bounds of decency. But Popp&aelig;a Sabina
having driven him on to
murders his wife and mother;
the murder of his mother and his wife Octavia, and Tigellinus being
made his confident, he felt no longer restrained
by the fear of public opinion. The executions of
individuals, nearly all of which history has recorded,
was not, perhaps, upon the whole, the greatest evil;
plunders the provinces to support his profligacy.
the plunder of the provinces, not
only to support his own loose and effeminate
pleasures, but also to maintain the people in a
continual state of intoxication, had nearly caused
the dissolution of the empire. The last years of
Nero were marked by a striking and undoubted
insanity, which displayed itself in his theatrical
performances, and even in the history of his fall.

Upper Germany, by the lieutenant Virginius Rufus, these insurrections
seemed quelled, when the pr&aelig;torian guard, instigated
thereto by Nymphidius, broke out into rebellion in Rome itself.
Flight and death of Nero, June 11, 68. Foreign wars during[Pg 425]

of the valiant Corbulo, against the Parthians (see above, p. 303);
and in Palestine against the Jews, 66. Great fire in Rome,
64, which gives rise to the first persecution against the Christians.

The principal cause why the despotism of Nero and his predecessors
was so tamely submitted to by the nation, may undoubtedly
be found in the fact, that the greater part of it was
fed by the emperors. To the monthly distributions of corn were
now added the extraordinary congiaria and viscerationes (supplies
of wine and meat). The periods of tyranny were very
likely the golden days of the people.

Extinction
of the Julian
family
causes
many troubles.


17. By the death of Nero the house of C&aelig;sar
became extinct, and this gave rise to so many
commotions, that in somewhat less than two years,
four emperors by violence obtained possession of
the throne. The right of the senate to name, or
at least to confirm, the successors to the throne,
was still indeed acknowledged; but as the armies
had found out that they could create emperors,
the power of the senate dwindled into an
empty ceremony.
Galba, June 11, 68&mdash;Jan. 15, 69.
Servius Sulpicius Galba, now
seventy-two years of age, having been already
proclaimed emperor by the legions in Spain, and
acknowledged by the senate, gained possession
of Rome without striking a blow, the attempt of
Nymphidius having completely failed, and Virginius
Rufus voluntarily submitting to him.
Galba, however, having given offence both to the

pr&aelig;torian guard and the German legions, was
dethroned by the guards, at the instigation of his
former friend Otho, at the very time when he
thought he had secured his throne by adopting[Pg 426]
the young Licinius Piso, and had frustrated the
hopes of Otho.

Otho, Jan.

18. M. Otho, aged thirty-seven, was indeed acknowledged
emperor by the senate, but wanted
the sanction of the German legions, who, proclaiming
their general, A. Vitellius, emperor, invaded
Italy. Otho marches against him, but
after the loss of the battle of Bedriacum kills
himself&mdash;whether from fear or patriotism, remains
uncertain.

The special sources for the history of Galba and Otho, are
their Lives by Plutarch.

Vitellius,
April 16,
Dec. 20,

19. Vitellius, in his thirty-seventh year, was
acknowledged emperor not only by the senate,
but likewise in the provinces; his debaucheries
and cruelty, however, together with the licentiousness
of his troops, having rendered him
odious at Rome, the Syrian legions rebelled and
proclaimed their general,
Vespasian proclaimed emperor.
T. Flavius Vespasian,
emperor, who, at the solicitation of the powerful
Mutianus, governor of Syria, accepted the imperial
diadem. The troops on the Danube declaring
for him shortly after, and marching into Italy
under their general Antonius Primus defeated
the army of Vitellius at Cremona. Vitellius was
immediately hurled from the throne, though not
till after some blood had been spilt by the commotions
that took place at Rome, in which Flavius
Sabinus, the brother of Vespasian, was slain, and
the capitol burnt.

Vespasian,

20. Flavius Vespasian ascended the throne in
his fifty-ninth year, and became thereby the
founder of a dynasty which gave three emperors
to Rome. The state, almost ruined by profusion,
[Pg 427]civil war, and successive revolutions, found in
Vespasian a monarch well suited to its unhappy
condition. He endeavoured, as far as he could,
to determine the relations between
Fixes the power of the senate;
himself and the senate; while, by a decree, he restored to it
all the rights and privileges which had been conferred
upon it by his predecessors of the family of
C&aelig;sar, and settled and added some others (lex
regia). He made a thorough reform in the

founds public buildings, and promotes education; banishes the Stoics;
His liberality in the foundation of public buildings,
as well in Rome as in other cities; and the
care with which he promoted education, by granting
salaries to public teachers, are sufficient to
free him from the reproach of avarice; and although,
on account of their dangerous opinions,
he banished the Stoics (who since the time of
Nero had become very numerous, and retained
nearly all the principles of republicanism), the annulling of the

of Jerusalem, A. C. 70; and a much greater war

were reduced to an accommodation by Cerealis, 70. Expeditions[Pg 428]

13, 81.

21. His eldest son, Titus Flavius Vespasian,
who in the year 70 had been created C&aelig;sar, and
reigned from his thirty-ninth to his forty-second
year, gives us the rare example of a prince becoming
better on the throne. His short and benevolent
reign was, indeed, only remarkable for
its public calamities: an eruption of mount Vesuvius,
overwhelming several cities, was followed
by a destructive fire, and

of being, if not the happiest, at least the best
of princes.

96.

a complete and cruel despot;

unsuccessful in war;

raises the soldiers' pay;

employs informers.

22. His younger brother and successor, L.
Flavius Domitian, who reigned from his thirtieth
to his forty-fifth year, gives an example quite opposite
to that of Titus: beginning with justice
and severity, he soon degenerated into the completest
despot that ever swayed the Roman sceptre.
His cruelty, joined to an equal degree of pride,
and nourished by suspicion and jealousy, made
him the enemy of all who excelled him by their
exploits, their riches, or their talents. The mortifications
to which his pride must have been subjected
in consequence of his unsuccessful wars
against the Catti, and more particularly the Daci,
increased his bad disposition. His despotism
was founded upon his armies, whose pay he aug[Pg 429]mented
one fourth; and that he might not thereby
diminish the treasury, as he had too much
done at first, he multiplied the judicia majestatis,
rendering it still more terrible by the employment
of secret informers (delatores), in order, by
confiscations, to augment the wealth of his private
treasury (fiscus). By confining his cruelty
chiefly to the capital, and by a strict superintendence
over the governors of provinces, Domitian
prevented any such general disorganization of the
empire as took place under Nero. His fall confirmed
the general truth, that tyrants have little
to fear from the people, but much from individuals
who may think their lives in danger.

The foreign wars during this reign are rendered more worthy
of remark by being the first in which the barbarians attacked the
empire with success. Domitian's ridiculous expedition against
the Catti, 82, gave the first proof of his boundless vanity; as did
the recall of the victorious Agricola, 85, from Britain, of his jealousy.
His most important war was that against the Daci, or
Get&aelig;, who, under their brave king Dercebal, had attacked the
Roman frontiers; this again occasioned another with their neighbours,
the Marcomanni, Quadi, and Jazygi, 86&mdash;90, which
turned out so unfortunate for Rome, that Domitian was obliged
to purchase a peace of the Daci by paying them an annual
tribute.

the dawn of

period.

23. M. Cocceius Nerva, aged about seventy
years was raised to the throne by the murderers
of Domitian; and now, at last, seemed to break
forth the dawn of a more happy period for the
empire.  The preceding reign of terror completely
ceased at once; and he endeavoured to
impart fresh vigour to industry, not only by diminishing
the taxes, but also by distributing lands
to the poor. The insurrection of the guards cer[Pg 430]tainly
cost the murderers of Domitian their lives;
but it was at the same time the cause of Nerva's
securing the prosperity of the empire after his
death, by the adoption of Trajan.

the best of
the Roman
monarchs.

Restores the Roman constitution;

his frugality and liberality;

conquers Dacia,

Armenia, Mesopotamia, and part of Arabia.

24. M. Ulpius Trajan (after his adoption, Nerva
Trajan), a Spaniard by birth, governed the empire
from his forty-second to his sixty-second
year. He was the first foreigner who ascended
the Roman throne, and at the same time the first
of their monarchs who was equally great as a
ruler, a general, and a man. After completely
abolishing the judicia majestatis, he made the restoration
of the free Roman constitution, so far as
it was compatible with a monarchical form, his
peculiar care. He restored the elective power to
the comitia, complete liberty of speech to the senate,
and to the magistrates their former authority;
and yet he exercised the art of ruling to a
degree and in a detail which few princes have
equalled. Frugal in his expenses, he was nevertheless
splendidly liberal to every useful institution,
whether in Rome or the provinces, as well
as in the foundation of military roads, public monuments,
and schools for the instruction of poor
children. By his wars he extended the dominion
of Rome beyond its former boundaries; subduing,
in his contests with the Daci, their country,
and reducing it to a Roman province; as he likewise
did, in his wars against the Armenians and
Parthians, Armenia, Mesopotamia, and part of
Arabia. Why was so great a character disfigured
by an ambition of conquest?

The first war against the Daci, in which the shameful tribute
was withdrawn and Dercebal reduced to subjection, lasted from[Pg 431]
101&mdash;103. But as Dercebal again rebelled, the war was renewed
in 105, and brought to a close in 106, when Dacia was
reduced to a Roman province, and many Roman colonies established
therein. The war with the Parthians arose from a dispute
respecting the possession of the throne of Armenia (see
above, p. 304), 114&mdash;116: but although Rome was victorious
she gained no permanent advantage thereby.

The especial source for the history of Trajan is the Panegyricus
of Pliny the Younger; the correspondence, however, of
the same writer, while governor of Bithynia, with the emperor,
affords us a much deeper insight into the spirit of his government:

Adrian.

25. By the contrivances of Plotina, his wife,
Trajan was succeeded by his cousin and pupil,
whom he is said also to have adopted, P. &AElig;lius
Adrian, who reigned from his forty-second to his
sixty-third year. He was acknowledged at once
by the army of Asia, with which he then was,
and the sanction of the senate followed immediately
after. He differed from his predecessor
in that his chief aim was the preservation of
peace; on which account he gave up (rare moderation!),
directly after his accession, the newly
conquered provinces of Asia, Armenia, Assyria,
and Mesopotamia, and so put an end to the Par[Pg 432]thian
war (see above, p. 304.) He retained,
though with some unwillingness, that of Dacia,
because otherwise the Roman colonies would
have become exposed. He well made up for his
pacific disposition, however, in seeking, by a general
and vigorous reform in the internal administration,
and by restoring the discipline of the
army, to give greater solidity to the empire. For
that purpose he visited successively all the provinces
of the Roman empire; first the eastern,
and afterwards the western; making useful regulations
and establishing order wherever he came.
He improved the Roman jurisprudence by the
introduction of the edictum perpetuum. Passionately
fond of and well instructed in literature and
the fine arts, he gave them his liberal protection,
and thus called forth another Augustan age.
Upon the whole, his reign was certainly a salutary
one for the empire; and for any single acts
of injustice of which he may be accused, he fully
compensated by his choice of a successor. After
having first adopted L. Aurelius Verus (afterwards
&AElig;lius Verus), who fell a sacrifice to his debaucheries,
he next adopted T. Aurelius Antoninus
(afterwards T. &AElig;lius Adrianus Antoninus Pius),
upon condition that he should again adopt M.
Aurelius Verus (afterwards M. Aurelius Antoninus),
and L. Cesonius Commodus (afterwards L.
Verus), the son of &AElig;lius Verus.

During his reign a great revolt broke out in Jud&aelig;a, under
Barcochab, 132&mdash;135, occasioned by the introduction of pagan
worship into the Roman colony of &AElig;lia Capitolina (the ancient
Jerusalem).

Aug. Minores, already quoted.

Antoninus
Pius, July
10, 138.&mdash;March
7,
161.

26. The reign of Antoninus Pius, from his
forty-seventh to his seventieth year, was without
doubt the happiest period of the Roman empire.
He found everything already in excellent order;
and those ministers which Adrian had appointed,
he continued in their places. His quiet activity
furnishes but little matter for history; and yet he
was, perhaps, the most noble character that ever
sat upon a throne. Although a prince, his life
was that of the most blameless individual; while
he administered the affairs of the empire as
though they were his own. He honoured the
senate; and the provinces flourished under him,
not only because he kept a watchful eye over the
conduct of the governors, but because he made it
a maxim of his government to continue in their
places all those whose probity he had sufficiently
proved. He observed rigid order in the finances,
and yet without sparing where it could be of
service in the foundation or improvement of useful
institutions; as his erection of many buildings,
establishment of public teachers with salaries in
all the provinces, and other examples fully show.
He carried on no war himself; on the contrary,
several foreign nations made choice of him to
arbitrate their differences. Some rebellions which
broke out in Britain and Egypt, and some frontier
wars excited by the Germans, the Daci, the
Moors, and the Alani, were quelled by his lieutenants.

[Pg 434]The principal and almost the only source for the history of
Antoninus Pius, Dion Cassius's history of this period being lost,
is his Life by Julius Capitolinus in the Script. Hist. August.
And even this refers to his private character rather than his
public history. Compare the excellent Reflections of Marcus
Aurelius, i, 16. upon this prince.

27. He was succeeded by Marcus Aurelius
Antoninus, the philosopher (aged 40&mdash;59 years),
who immediately associated with himself, under
the title of Augustus, L. Verus (aged 30&mdash;40
years, &#8224; 169), to whom he gave his daughter in
marriage. Notwithstanding the differences of
their character, the most cordial union existed
between them during the whole of their common
reign; L. Verus, indeed, being almost always
absent in the wars, took but a very small share in
the government. The reign of M. Aurelius was
marked by several great calamities: a dreadful
pestilence, a famine, and almost continual wars.
Nothing short of a prince like Aurelius, who exhibited
to the world the image of wisdom seated
on a throne, could have made so much misery tolerable. Soon after

made an irruption upon the Rhine, and the Parthians

northern nations, who now began to press forward
with great force upon Dacia, were of much greater
consequence. They occupied M. Aurelius from
the year 167, with but little intermission, to the
end of his reign. He succeeded, indeed, in main[Pg 435]taining
the boundaries of the empire; but then
he was the first who settled any of the barbarians
within it, or took them into the Roman
service. In the internal administration of affairs
he closely followed the steps of his predecessor,
Avidius Cassius's rebellion,
except that he was rather too much influenced
by his freedmen and family. The only rebellion
which broke out against him, was that of Avidius
Cassius, his lieutenant in Syria, occasioned by a
false report of his
and death, 175.
death; but it was quelled by
the destruction of that general, as soon as the
truth was made known.

The war against the Parthians (see above, p. 304) was indeed
brought to a successful issue by Verus, the principal cities of the
Parthians falling into the hands of the Romans; Verus left
them, however, to be carried on by his lieutenants, while he rioted
in debaucheries at Antioch. The first war against the Marcomanni,
carried on in the beginning and until the death of Verus,
by the two emperors together, was highly dangerous for Rome,
as many other nations had joined the Marcomanni, particularly
the Quadi, Jazygi, and Vandals, and penetrated as far as Aquileia.
M. Aurelius ended this war by a glorious peace, 174, as
he found it necessary to stop the progress of Cassius's rebellion;
in 178, however, the Marcomanni again commenced hostilities,
and before their close M. Aurelius died at Sirmium. Contemporary
with these wars, yet, as it seems, without any connection
with them, were the attacks of other nations upon Dacia, the
Bastarn&aelig;, Alani, etc. who poured in from the north, probably
pressed forward by the advance of the Goths. This was the first
symptom of the great migration of nations now beginning.

The especial sources for the history of M. Aurelius, are the

T. Commodus,
March
17, 180&mdash;Dec.
31,
192.

28. By means of adoption the Roman empire
had been blessed, during the last eighty years,
with a succession of rulers such as have not often
fell to the lot of any kingdom. But in J. Commodus
the son of M. Aurelius (probably the offspring
of a gladiator), who reigned from his nineteenth
to his thirty-first year, there ascended the
throne a monster of cruelty, insolence, and lewdness.
At the commencement of his reign he
bought a peace of the Marcomanni that he might
return to Rome. Being himself unable to support
the burden of government, the helm of state
Perennis, &#8224; 186.
was placed in the hands of the stern and cruel
Perennis, pr&aelig;fect of the pr&aelig;torian guard; but
who, being murdered by the discontented soldiers,
was succeeded by the freedman
Cleander, &#8224; 189.
Cleander, who put up all for sale, till he fell a sacrifice to
his own insatiable avarice, in a revolt of the
people, caused by their want of provisions. The
extravagant propensity of Commodus for the
diversions of the amphitheatres, and the combats
of wild beasts and gladiators, wherein he himself
usually took a part, in the character of Hercules,
became a chief cause of his dissipation, and
thereby of his cruelty; till at last he was killed
at the instigation of his concubine Marcia, L&aelig;tus
the pr&aelig;fect of the pr&aelig;torian guard, and Electus.
182&mdash;184.
The wars on the frontiers during his reign, in
Dacia, and especially in Britain, were successfully
carried on by his lieutenants, generals who
belonged to the school of his father.[Pg 437]

The especial source for the history of Commodus is his private
life by &AElig;l. Lampridius, in the Script. Hist. August.&mdash;The
history of Herodian begins with his reign.

State of the
empire at
this period.

29. The disasters under M. Aurelius, and the
extravagances of Commodus, had injured the empire,
but not enfeebled it. Towards the close of
the period of the Antonines it still retained its
pristine vigour. If wise regulations, internal peace,
moderate taxes, a certain degree of political, and
unrestrained civil liberty, are sufficient to form
the happiness of a commonwealth, it must have
been found in the Roman. What a number of
advantages did it possess over every other, simply
from its situation! Proofs of it appear on every
side. A vigorous population, rich provinces,
flourishing and splendid cities, and a lively internal
and foreign trade. But the most solid
foundation of the happiness of a nation consists in
its moral greatness, and this we here seek for in
vain. Otherwise the nation would not so easily
have suffered itself to be brought under the yoke
of Commodus by pr&aelig;torian cohorts and the legions.
But what best shows the strength which
the empire still retained, is the opposition it continued
to make, for two hundred years longer, to
the formidable attacks from without.

Foreign commerce, so flourishing in this period, could only be
carried on, to any extent, with the east&mdash;mostly with India&mdash;as
the Roman empire spread over all the west. This trade continued
to be carried on through Egypt, and also through Palmyra
and Syria. Information thereupon will be found in

SECOND SECTION.

From the death of Commodus to Diocletian,
A. C. 193&mdash;284.

Sources. The Extracts of Xiphilinus from Dion Cassius,
lib. lxxiii&mdash;lxxx. though often imperfect, reach down as low as
the consulate of Dion himself under Alexander Severus, 229.&mdash;Herodiani
Hist. libri viii. comprise the period from Commodus
to Gordian, 180&mdash;238.&mdash;The Scriptores Histori&aelig; August&aelig; Minores
contain the private lives of the emperors down to Diocletian,
by Julius Capitolinus, Flavius Vopiscus, etc.&mdash;The
Breviaria Histori&aelig; Roman&aelig; of Eutropius, Aurelius Victor,
and S. Rufus are particularly important for this period.&mdash;Finally,
the important information that may be derived from the
study of medals and coins, not only for this section, but for the
whole history of the emperors, may be best learnt by consulting
the writers upon those subjects: J. Vaillant, Numismata Augustorum
et C&aelig;sarum, cura J. F. Baldino. Rome, 1743, 3 vols.
The Medallic History of Imperial Rome, by W. Cooke. London,
1781, 2 vols.&mdash;But above all, the volumes belonging to this
period in Eckhel, Doctrina Nummorum Veterum.

With the period of the Antonines begins the great work of
the British historian:

The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,
by Edward Gibbon. Oxford, 1828, 8 vols. 8vo. In worth and
extent this work is superior to all others. It embraces the whole
period of the middle ages; but only the first part belongs to this
period.[Pg 439]

Pertinax,
Jan. 1&mdash;March 28, 193.

1.  The extinction of the race of the Antonines
by the death of Commodus was attended with
convulsions similar to those which took place
when the house of C&aelig;sar became extinct at the
death of Nero. It is true that P. Helvius Pertinax,
aged sixty-seven, pr&aelig;fect of the city, was
raised to the throne by the murderers of Commodus;
and that he was acknowledged, first by the
guards, and afterwards by the senate. But the
reform which he was obliged to make at the beginning
of his reign in the finances, rendered him
so odious to the soldiers and courtiers, that a revolt
of the first, excited by L&aelig;tus, cost him his
life before he had reigned quite three months.
This was the first commencement of that dreadful
military despotism which forms the ruling character
of this period; and to none did it become
so terrible as to those who wished to make it the
main support of their absolute power.

The insolence of the pr&aelig;torian guard had risen very high during
the reign of Commodus; but it had never, even in the time
of the Antonines, been entirely suppressed. It was only by
large donatives that their consent could be purchased, their caprice
satisfied, and their good humour maintained; especially at
every new adoption. One of the greatest reproaches to the age
of the Antonines is, that those great princes, who seem to have
had the means so much in their power, did not free themselves
from so annoying a dependence.

Didias Julianus.

2. When, upon the death of Pertinax, the rich
and profligate M. Didius Julianus, aged fifty-seven,
had outbid, to the great scandal of the
people, all his competitors for the empire, and
purchased it of the pr&aelig;torian guard, an insurrection
of the legions, who were better able to create
[Pg 440]emperors, very naturally followed. But as the
army of Illyria proclaimed their general
Septimius Severus, Pescennius Niger, Albinus.
Septimius Severus, the army of Syria, Pescennius Niger,
and the army of Britain, Albinus, nothing less
than a series of civil wars could decide who should
maintain himself on the throne.

&AElig;l. Spartiani Didius Julianus, in Script. Hist. Aug.

3. Septimius Severus, however, aged 49&mdash;66,
was the first who got possession of Rome, and,
after the execution of Didius Julianus, he was
acknowledged by the senate. He dismissed, it
is true, the old pr&aelig;torian guard, but immediately
chose, from his own army, one four times more
numerous in its stead. And after he had provisionally
declared Albinus emperor, he marched
his army against Pescennius Niger, already master
of the east, whom, after several contests near
the Issus, he defeated and slew. Nevertheless,
having first taken and destroyed the strong city
of Byzantium, a war with Albinus soon followed,
whom the perfidious Severus had already attempted
to remove by assassination. After a
bloody defeat near Lyons,
Albinus kills himself, Feb. 19, 197.
Albinus kills himself.
These civil wars were followed by hostilities
against the Parthians, who had taken the part of
Pescennius, and which ended with the plundering
of their principal cities (see above, p. 304). Severus
possessed most of the virtues of a soldier;
but the insatiable avarice of his minister Plautianus,
the formidable captain of the pr&aelig;torian
guard, robbed the empire even of those advantages
which may be enjoyed under a military government,
204.
until he was put to death at the instigation
of Caracalla. To keep his legions em[Pg 441]ployed,
Severus undertook an expedition into
Britain, where, after extending the boundaries of
the empire, he died at York (Eboracum), leaving
his son the maxim, "to enrich the soldiers, and
hold the rest for nothing."

Agricola had already erected a line of fortresses, probably
between the Firth of Clyde and the Firth of Forth. These were
changed by Adrian into a wall along the present boundaries of
Scotland. Severus again extended the frontiers, reestablished
the fortresses of Agricola, and afterwards built a wall from sea
to sea; his son, however, gave up the conquered country, and the
wall of Adrian again became the boundary of the empire.

Caracalla,
Feb. 4, 211&mdash;April
4,
217.

4. The deadly hatred which reigned between
the two sons of Severus, M. Aurelius Antoninus
Bassianus Caracalla, aged 23&mdash;29, and his young
step-brother Geta, aged twenty-one, led to a
dreadful catastrophe; for at their return to Rome,
and after a fruitless proposition had been made
for a division of the empire,
Geta murdered, April 4, 212.
Geta was assassinated
in the arms of his mother Julia Domna, together
with all those who were considered as his
friends. The restless spirit of Caracalla, however,
soon drew him from Rome, and in traversing
first the provinces along the Danube, and
then those of the east, he ruined them all by his
exactions and cruelty, to which he was driven for
money to pay his soldiers, and to purchase peace
of his enemies on the frontiers. The same necessity
led him to grant the right of citizenship to all
the provinces, that he might thereby gain the
duty of the vicesima hereditatum et manumissionum
(twentieth upon inheritances and enfranchisements),
which he very soon afterwards changed
[Pg 442]into a tenth (decima).&mdash;With respect to his foreign
wars, his first was against the Catti and Alemanni,
215.
among whom he remained a long time,
sometimes as a friend and sometimes as an enemy.
But his principal efforts, after having previously
ordered a dreadful massacre of the inhabitants
of Alexandria, to satisfy his cruel rapacity,
were directed against
216.
the Parthians (see
above, p. 304); and in his wars against them he
was assassinated by Macrinus, the pr&aelig;fect of the
pr&aelig;torian guard.

The pr&aelig;fect, or captain, of the pr&aelig;torian guard became, from
the time of Severus, the most important officer in the state.
Besides the command of the guards, the finances were also under
his control, together with an extensive criminal jurisdiction. A
natural consequence of the continually increasing despotism.

Macrinus,
April 11,
217&mdash;June
8, 218.

5. His murderer, M. Opelius Macrinus, aged
fifty-three, was recognized as emperor by the soldiers,
and forthwith acknowledged by the senate.
He immediately created his son, M. Opelius Diadumenus,
aged nine years, C&aelig;sar, and gave him
the name of Antoninus. He disgracefully terminated
the war against the Parthians by purchasing
a peace, and changed the decima (tenth) of
Caracalla again into the vicesima (twentieth).
However, while he still remained in Asia, Bassianus
Heliogabalus, grand-nephew of Julia Domna,
and high priest in the temple of the Sun at
Emesa, whom his mother gave out for a son of
Caracalla, was proclaimed emperor by the legions,
and, after a combat with the guards, subsequently
to which Macrinus and his son lost their
lives, they raised him to the throne.[Pg 443]

M&aelig;sa, the sister of Julia Domna, had two daughters, both
widows; So&aelig;mis, the eldest, was the mother of Heliogabalus,
Mamm&aelig;a, the youngest, the mother of Alexander Severus.

Heliogabalus,
June 8,
218&mdash;March
11, 222.

6.  Heliogabalus, aged 14&mdash;18, who assumed
the additional name of M. Aurelius Antoninus,
brought with him from Syria the superstitions
and voluptuousness of that country. He introduced
the worship of his god Heliogabal in Rome,
and wallowed openly in such brutal and infamous
debaucheries, that history can scarcely find a
parallel to his dissolute, shameless, and scandalous
conduct. How low must the morality of that
age have been sunk, in which a boy could so early
have ripened into a monster!&mdash;The debasement
of the senate, and of all important offices, which
he filled with the degraded companions of his
own lusts and vices, was systematically planned
by him; and he deserves no credit even for the
adoption of his cousin, the virtuous Alexander
Severus, as he shortly after endeavoured to take
away his life, but was himself for that reason assassinated
by the pr&aelig;torian guards.

235.


7.  His young cousin and successor, M. Aurelius
Alexander Severus, aged 14&mdash;27, who had been
carefully educated under the direction of his mother
Mamm&aelig;a, proved one of the best princes in
an age and upon a throne where virtues were
more dangerous than vices. Under favour of his
youth he endeavoured to effect a reform, in which
he was supported by the cooperation of the guards,
who had elevated him to the throne. He restored
the authority of the senate, from among
[Pg 444]whom he chose, with rigid justice, his privy council
of state, banishing the creatures of Heliogabalus
War against Persia, 226.
from their places. The revolution in the
Parthian empire, out of which was now formed
the new Persian, was of so much importance to
Rome, that it obliged Alexander to undertake a
war against Artaxerxes, in which he was probably
victorious. But while
231&mdash;233.
marching in haste to protect the frontiers against the advance of the
Germans upon the Rhine, his soldiers, exasperated
at the severity of his discipline, and incited
by the Thracian Maximin,
235.
murdered him
in his own tent. His pr&aelig;fect of the pr&aelig;torian
guard, Ulpian, had already, for the same cause,
fallen a victim to this spirit of insubordination, which was not checked
222.
even by the immediate
presence of the emperor himself.

The revolution in Parthia, whereby a new Persian empire was
formed (see above, p. 304.), became a source of almost perpetual
war to Rome; Artaxerxes I. and his successors, the Sassanides,
claiming to be descendants of the ancient kings of Persia, formed
pretensions to the possession of all the Asiatic provinces of the
Roman empire.

8. The death of A. Severus raised military
despotism to the highest pitch, as it placed on the
throne the half savage C. Julius Maximinus, by
birth a Thracian peasant. At first he continued
the war against the Germans with great success,
repulsing them beyond the Rhine; and resolved,
by crossing Pannonia, to carry the war even
among the Sarmatians. But his insatiable rapacity,
which spared neither the capital nor the
[Pg 445]provinces, made him hateful to all; and Gordian,
proconsul of Africa, in his eightieth year,
was, together with his son of the same name,
proclaimed Augustus by the people, and immediately
acknowledged by the senate. Upon
April, 238.
this, Maximinus, eager to take vengeance on the
senate, marched directly from Sirmium towards
Italy.  In the mean time, the legions of the
almost defenceless Gordians were defeated in
The Gordians.
Africa, and themselves slain by Capellianus the
governor of Numidia. Notwithstanding this, as
the senate could expect no mercy, they chose as
co-emperors the pr&aelig;fect of the city, Maximus
Pupienus, and Clodius
Balbinus and Pupienus.
Balbinus, who, in conformity
with the wishes of the people, created
the young Gordian III. C&aelig;sar. In the meanwhile
Maximinus, having besieged Aquileia, and
the enterprise proving unsuccessful, was slain by
his own troops. Pupienus and Balbinus now
seemed in quiet possession of the throne; but
the guards, who had already been engaged in a
bloody feud with the people, and were not willing
to receive an emperor of the senate's choosing,
killed them both, and proclaimed as Augustus,
Gordian, already created C&aelig;sar.

9. The reign of the young M. Antoninus Gordianus
lasted from his twelfth to his eighteenth
year. He was grandson of the proconsul who had
lost his life in Africa, and in the early part of his
reign, acquired a degree of firmness from the
support of his father-in-law, Misitheus, pr&aelig;fect
of the pr&aelig;torian guard, as well as from the suc[Pg 446]cessful
expedition which he undertook into Syria
against the Persians, who had invaded that province.
But after the death of Misitheus, Philip
the Arabian, being made pr&aelig;fect of the guards in
his stead, found means to gain the troops over
to himself, and, after driving Gordian from the
throne, caused him to be assassinated.

Philippus,
Feb. 244&mdash;Sept.

10. The reign of M. Julius Philippus was interrupted
by several insurrections, especially in
Pannonia; until at length Decius, whom he himself
had sent thither to quell the rebellion, was
compelled by the troops to assume the diadem.
Philip was soon after defeated by him near Verona,
where he perished, together with his son of
the same name. In this reign the secular games,
ludi s&aelig;culares, were celebrated, one thousand
years from the foundation of the city.

Gallus.

11. Under the reign of his successor, Trajanus
Decius, aged fifty, the Goths for the first time
forced their way into the Roman empire by crossing
the Danube; and although Decius in the beginning
opposed them with success, he was at
last slain by them in Thrace, together with his
son, Cl. Herennius Decius, already created C&aelig;sar.
Upon this the army proclaimed C. Trebonianus
Gallus emperor, who created his son, Volusian,
C&aelig;sar; and having invited Hostilian, the
yet remaining son of Decius, with the ostensible
purpose of securing his cooperation, he nevertheless
soon contrived to get rid of him. He purchased
a peace of the Goths; but, despised by his generals,
he became involved in a war with his victorious lieutenant,
&AElig;milianus, May 253.
&AElig;milius &AElig;milianus, in M&#339;sia,
and was slain, together with his son, by his own
[Pg 447]army. In three months, however, &AElig;milianus
shared the same fate; Publius Licinius Valerianus,
the friend and avenger of Gallus, advancing
against him with the legions stationed in Gaul.
Both the people and army hoped to see the empire
restored under
Valerian.
Valerian, already sixty years
of age; but, although his generals defended the
frontiers against the Germans and Goths, he
himself had the misfortune to be defeated and
taken prisoner by the superior forces of the Persians.
Upon this event his son and associate in
the empire, P. Licinius
Gallienus, 259&mdash;968.
Gallienus, who knew
everything except the art of governing, reigned
alone. Under his indolent rule the Roman empire
seemed on one hand ready to be split into
a number of small states, while on the other it
seemed about to fall a prey to the barbarians;
for the lieutenants in most of the provinces declared
themselves independent of a prince whom
they despised, and to which, indeed, they were
driven, like Posthumius in Gaul, for their own
security.&mdash;There were nineteen of these; but as
many of them named their sons C&aelig;sars, this period
has been very improperly distinguished by
the name of the thirty tyrants, although their intolerable
oppressions might well justify the latter
expression. The Persians at the same time were
victorious in the east, and the Germans in the
west.

The German nations which were now become so formidable to
the Roman empire, were: 1. The great confederation of tribes
under the name of Franks, who spread over Gaul along the whole
extent of the Lower Rhine. 2. The allied nations of the Alemanni
on the Upper Rhine. 3. The Goths, the most powerful
of all, who had formed a monarchy upon the banks of the Lower[Pg 448]
Danube and the northern coasts of the Black sea, which soon
extended from the Boristhenes to the Don; and who became
formidable, not only by their land forces, but also by their naval
power, especially after they had captured the peninsula of Crim
Tartary (Chersonesus Taurica); and by means of their fleets
they not only kept the Grecian, but likewise the Asiatic provinces
in a continual state of alarm.

recommended M. Aurelius Claudius (aged

not only by taking Aureolus prisoner and
defeating the Alemanni, but also by a decisive
269.
victory gained at Nissa over the Goths, who had
invaded M&#339;sia. He died, however, soon after,
at Sirmium, of a pestilential disease, naming for
his successor Aurelian, a hero like himself, who
mounted the throne upon the death of Quintillus
the late emperor's brother, who had at first proclaimed
himself Augustus, but afterwards died by
his own hand.

13. During the reign of L. Domitius Aurelianus,
which lasted almost five years, those
countries which had been partly or entirely lost
to the empire were restored. Having first driven
back the Goths and the Alemanni, who had advanced
as far as Umbria, he undertook his expedition
271.
against the celebrated Zenobia, queen of
[Pg 449]Palmyra, who at that time possessed Syria, Egypt,
and part of Asia Minor. These countries he again
brought under the dominion of the empire, after having
Zenobia defeated and made prisoner, 271&mdash;273.
defeated Zenobia and made her prisoner.
The western provinces of Gaul, Britain, and Spain,
which since the time of Gallienus had
been governed by separate rulers, and were now
under the dominion of Tetricus, he reduced to
their former obedience. Dacia, on the contrary,
he willingly abandoned; and as he transported
274.
the Roman inhabitants across the Danube into
M&#339;sia, the latter henceforward bore the name of
Dacia Aureliani. Hated for his severity, which
in a warrior so easily degenerates into cruelty,
275.
he was assassinated in Illyria at the instigation of
his private secretary Mnestheus.

Flav. Vopisci divus Aurelianus, in Script. Hist. Aug.

Palmyra in the Syrian desert, enriched by the Indian trade,
and one of the most ancient cities in the world, became a Roman
colony in the time of Trajan. Odenatus, the husband of Zenobia,
had acquired so much celebrity by his victories over the Persians,
that Gallienus had even named him Augustus with himself.
He was murdered, however, by his cousin M&aelig;onius, 267.
Zenobia now took possession of the government for her sons
Vabalathus, Herennianus, and Timolaus, without, however, being
acknowledged at Rome. After this, in the time of Claudius,
she added Egypt to her dominions. Aurelian, having first
defeated her near Antioch and Emesa, soon afterwards took
Palmyra, which, in consequence of a revolt, he destroyed.&mdash;Even
in its ruins Palmyra is still magnificent.

The Ruins of Palmyra, by R. Wood. London, 1753; and
the Ruins of Balbec, otherwise Heliopolis, by the same author,
London, 1757, give us clear and certain ideas of the splendour
and magnitude of these cities.

14. An interregnum of six months followed
upon the death of Aurelian, till at length the
senate, at the repeated solicitations of the army,
ventured to fill up the vacant throne. The object
of their choice, however, M. Claudius Tacitus,
the worthiest of the senators, was unfortunately
seventy-five years old, and perished after a short
reign of six months, in an expedition against the
Goths. Upon this event the army of Syria raised
M. Aurelius Probus to the purple; while Florianus
the brother of Tacitus, who had already been
acknowledged at Rome, was put to death by his
own people.

15. The six years' reign of Probus was a warlike
one. He defeated the Germans, and forced
them beyond the Rhine and Danube; strengthening
the frontiers by building a strong wall from
the Danube, near Regensburg, to the Rhine. He
also obliged the Persians to make peace. Nevertheless,
the number of towns which he reestablished
and peopled with prisoners of war, and the
vineyards which he caused his soldiers to plant
on the Rhine, are proofs that he had taste and
inclination for the arts of peace. This policy,
however, would not suit the legions! After he
had perished, therefore, by the hands of his
soldiers, they proclaimed the pr&aelig;fect of the pr&aelig;torian
guard, M. Aurelius Carus, emperor, who
created his two sons C&aelig;sars&mdash;men very unlike
each other in disposition, M. Aurelius Carinus
being one of the greatest reprobates, while M.
[Pg 451]Aurelius Numerianus was gentle by nature, and
had a mind well formed by study. The new emperor,
having defeated the Goths, marched against
the Persians, but was shortly afterwards killed, it
is said, by a flash of lightning. Nor did his son
Numerianus long survive him, being murdered
by his own father-in-law, Arrius Aper, the pr&aelig;torian
pr&aelig;fect.

Review of
the government
during
this period.

16. Although this period gives us a finished
picture of a complete military despotism, it is still
evident that this was owing to the entire separation
of the military order from the rest of the
people, by the introduction of standing armies,
and the extinction of all national spirit among
the citizens. The legions decided because the
people were unarmed. It was, indeed, only
among them, situated far from the soft luxuries
of the capital, and engaged in almost a continual
struggle with the barbarians, that a remnant of
the ancient Roman character was still preserved.
The nomination of their leaders to the purple became
a natural consequence, not only of the uncertainty
of the succession, which could not be
fixed by mere ordinances, but often of necessity,
from their being in the field under the pressure of
urgent circumstances. Thus a succession of distinguished
generals came to the throne: what
authority, indeed, would an emperor at that time
have had who was not a general? All durable
reform, however, was rendered quite impossible
by the quick succession of rulers. Even the best[Pg 452]
among them could do but very little for the internal
administration; as all their energies were
required to protect the frontiers, and defend
themselves against usurpers, who, with the exception
of the formality of being acknowledged
by the senate, had claims as well founded as
their own.

Luxury hastens
the decline
of the
empire.

17. The decline of the empire also became so
much the more rapid, in proportion as in these
days of terror luxury had increased not only in
the splendour and profligate effeminacy of private
life, but more particularly in public, to a pitch
almost beyond belief. The latter was especially
shown in the exhibitions of the amphitheatre and
circus; by which not only every new ruler, but
even every new magistrate was obliged to purchase
the favour of the people. Thus these remnants
of a free constitution served only to accelerate
the general ruin! What enjoyments, indeed,
could be found under the rod of despotism, except
those of the grossest sensuality; and to
satisfy this, the intellectual amusements of the
theatre (mimes and pantomimes), and even those
of rhetoric and poetry, were made to contribute.

Progress
and effects
of the
Christian
religion.

18. Yet, during this general decay, the gradual
spread of the Christian religion was working a
reform altogether of a different nature. Before
the end of this period it had opened itself a way
into every province, and, notwithstanding the
frequent persecutions, had made converts in every
rank of society, and was now on the eve of becoming
the predominant form of worship. We
shall be better able to estimate its value, if we
consider it as the vehicle by which civilization[Pg 453]
made its way among the rude nations that now
appeared on the scene, than if we merely consider
it as the means of improving the manners and
morals of the Roman world. In a political view
it became of the greatest importance on account
of the hierarchy, the frame-work of which was
now in a great measure constructed among its
professors. It was afterwards adopted as a state
religion; and although the ancient creed of Rome
had formerly been on the same footing, yet it was
only calculated for the republic, and not at all
for the now existing monarchy. The overthrow
of paganism was necessarily attended with some
violent convulsions, yet its loss was nothing to be
compared with the support which the throne
afterwards found in the hierarchy.

The dispersion of the Jews, and especially the persecutions
which were renewed from time to time, after the reign of Nero,
(but which only served to kindle enthusiasm,) strongly cooperated
in spreading the Christian religion. These persecutions were
principally called forth against the Christians on account of their
forming themselves into a separate society, which caused them to
be regarded as a dangerous sect at Rome, notwithstanding the
general toleration granted to every other system of religious
belief. Although towards the end of this period, only a very
small proportion of the inhabitants of the Roman empire as yet
professed the Christian faith, it nevertheless had followers in
every province.

Sources. It now becomes of importance to enquire whether
the historians were Christians or pagans. Zosimus, the imitator
of Polybius, belonged to the last. He describes the fall of the
Roman state, as his model does the previous part. Of his Histories
only five books and a half, to the time of Gratian, 410,
have descended to us. He was certainly a violent antagonist of
the Christians, yet, nevertheless, the best writer of this period.
Ammiani Marcellini Historiarum, lib. xiv&mdash;xxxi. from the
year 353&mdash;378 (the first thirteen books are lost). Probably a
Christian, but yet no flatterer; and, notwithstanding his tiresome
prolixity, highly instructive. Together with the writers of
general history already noticed at p. 437, we must here especially
add to the abbreviators, Pauli Orosii Hist. lib. vii. and Zonar&aelig;
Annales. The Panegyrici Veteres, from Diocletian to
Theodosius, can only be used with circumspection.&mdash;The writers
of church history, such as Eusebius, in his Hist. Eccles. lib. x.
and in his Vita Constantini Magni, lib. v. as well as his continuators,
Socrates, Theodoret, Sozomenus, and Evagrius, are
also highly important for the political history of this period,
though, from their partiality towards the Christian emperors,
they should rather be classed with the panegyrists than the historians.
To these may be added another principal source, viz.
the Constitutions of the emperors, which have been preserved in
the Codex Theodosianus and Justinianeus, from the time of Constantine
the Great.

Besides the works quoted at pages 411, 437, the Byzantine
historians here become of importance. We shall mention also:

1. The reign of C. Valerius Diocletian, aged
39&mdash;60, proclaimed emperor after the murder of
Numerianus, by the troops in Chalcedon, begins
a new section in Roman history. To the period
of military despotism succeeded the period of
partitions. After Diocletian had defeated Carinus
the yet remaining C&aelig;sar, in Upper M&#339;sia,
where he was assassinated, he made M. Valerius
Maximianus Herculius, a rough warrior who had
hitherto been his comrade in arms, the sharer of
his throne. Herculius now contended with the
Alemanni and Burgundians on the banks of the
Rhine, while Diocletian himself made head
against the Persians. Nevertheless, the two Augusti
soon found themselves unable to withstand
the barbarians, who were pressing forward on
every side, more especially as Carausius had
usurped and maintained the title of C&aelig;sar in
Britain. Each of them, therefore, created a C&aelig;sar:
Diocletian chose C. Galerius, and Maximianus
Flavius Constantius Chlorus, both of whom
had distinguished themselves as generals, at that
time the only road to advancement. The whole
empire was now divided between these four rulers;
so that each had certain provinces to govern and
defend; without detriment, however, to the unity
of the whole, or to the dependence in which a[Pg 456]
C&aelig;sar stood as the subordinate assistant and
future successor of his Augustus.

In the partition, 292, Diocletian possessed the eastern provinces;
Galerius, Thrace, and the countries on the Danube
(Illyricum); Maximianus, Italy, Africa, and the islands; and
Constantius, the western provinces of Gaul, Spain, Britain, and
Mauritania.

2. This new system could not but have a striking
effect upon the spirit of the government. It
was now not only in fact, but also in form, entirely
in the hands of the rulers. By their continual
absence from Rome they became freed
from that moral restraint in which the authority of
the senate, and the name of the republic, not yet
entirely laid aside, had held before them. Diocletian
formally assumed the diadem, and, with the
ornaments of the east, introduced its luxuries into
his court. Thus was laid the foundation of that
structure which Constantine the Great had to
complete.

296.


3. The consequences of this new system became
also oppressive to the provinces, inasmuch
as they had now to maintain four rulers, with
their courts, and as many armies. But however
loud might be the complaints of the oppression
occasioned thereby, it was, perhaps, the only
means of deferring the final overthrow of the
whole edifice. In fact, they succeeded not only
in defeating the usurpers, Allectus in Britain
293&mdash;296.
(who had murdered Carausius in 293), Julian in
Africa, and Achilleus in Egypt; but also in defending
the frontiers, which, indeed, by the victories
of Galerius over the Persians, they extended
as far as the Tigris. Did not, however,[Pg 457]
the gloomy perspective present itself, that among
so many rulers, and the undefined relations which
existed between the C&aelig;sars and the emperors,
the union could not be of long continuance?

Constantius, 305&mdash;307.

Galerius, 305&mdash;313.

4. Diocletian voluntarily abdicated the throne
(although the growing power and encroaching
disposition of Galerius might perhaps have had
some influence), and obliged his colleague Maximianus
to do the same. The two C&aelig;sars, Constantius
and Galerius, were proclaimed Augusti,
and altered the division of the empire, so that the
former possessed all the western countries, of
which, however, he freely ceded Italy and Africa
to Galerius, who had all the remaining provinces.
The latter, during the same year, created Flavius
Severus, C&aelig;sar, and confided to him the government
of Italy and Africa; as he did also C. Galerius
Maximin, to whom he gave the Asiatic
provinces. The administration of the two emperors,
however, was very different; Constantius
was as much beloved for his mild and disinterested
government, as Galerius was hated for his
harshness and prodigality. Constantius died very
soon after at York, leaving his son Constantine
heir to his dominions, who was immediately proclaimed
Augustus by the legions, although Galerius
would only acknowledge him as C&aelig;sar.

Constantine
the Great,
July 25,
306&mdash;May
22, 337.

5. Thus Constantine, who afterwards obtained
the surname of Great, began to rule, aged 33&mdash;64,
though at first only over Britain, Spain, and
Gaul; nevertheless, after seventeen years of violence
and warfare, he succeeded in opening himself
a way to the sole dominion of the empire.
The rulers disagreed among themselves; and for[Pg 458]midable
usurpers started up and rendered war inevitable.

The history of the first seven years of Constantine, 306&mdash;313,
is very complicated; after that, he had only one rival to struggle
with, 314&mdash;323. At his accession, Galerius, as Augustus, was
in possession of all the other provinces; of which, however, he
had given to C&aelig;sar Maximin the government of those of Asia,
and to C&aelig;sar Severus, now created Augustus, Italy and Africa.
The latter, however, rendering himself odious by his oppression,
Maxentius, the son of the former emperor, Maximianus, assumed
the title of Augustus at Rome (Oct. 28, 306), and associated
his father with himself in the government; so that at this time
there were six rulers: Galerius, Severus, Constantine, Maximin,
and the usurpers Maxentius and his father Maximianus. But
in the year 307, Severus, wishing to oppose Maxentius, was
abandoned by his own troops, upon which he surrendered himself
to Maximianus, who caused him to be executed. In his
place Galerius created his friend Licinius, Augustus; and Maximin
obtained the same dignity from his army in Asia. In the
mean time, Maximianus, after having endeavoured to supplant
his own son in Rome, fled to Constantine, who had crossed over
into Gaul and there defeated the Franks, 306; but having made
an attempt upon the life of Constantine, who had married his
daughter Fausta, that emperor caused him to be put to death,
310. As the excesses of Galerius soon brought him to the
grave, 311, there only remained Constantine, Licinius, and
Maximin, and the usurper Maxentius. The latter was soon defeated
and slain, 312, before the gates of Rome, by Constantine,
who thereby became master of Italy and the capital. A war
having broken out about the same time between Maximin and
Licinius, Maximin was defeated near Adrianople, and then
killed himself, 313. The year 314 brought on a war between
the two remaining emperors, Constantine and Licinius, which,
however, ended the same year in an accommodation, by which
Constantine obtained all the countries on the south bank of the
Danube, as well as Thrace and M&#339;sia Inferior; it broke out
again, however, in 322, and was finally terminated by a decisive
victory in Bithynia, and the total overthrow of Licinius, whom
Constantine put to death, 324.

6. However opposite may be the opinions[Pg 459]
formed respecting the reign of Constantine the
Great, its consequences are perfectly plain. Although
he annihilated military despotism, he established
in its stead, if not completely, yet in
great measure, the despotism of the court, and
likewise the power of the hierarchy.  He had
already, during his expedition against Maxentius,
decided in favour of the Christian religion; and
since he thereby gained a vast number of partisans
in all the provinces, and weakened at the
same time the power of his co-emperors, or competitors,
it was the surest way he could have
taken to obtain sole dominion, the great object of
his ambition.  This change must nevertheless
have had very considerable influence on every
part of the government, as he found in the previously
established hierarchy a powerful support of
the throne; and since he, in concert with it, settled
what was, and what was not the orthodox
doctrine, he introduced a spirit of persecution
heretofore unknown.

At a period in which religious parties must almost necessarily
have become political parties, we can by no means venture to
judge of the importance of the sect by the importance of their
points of doctrine. The quarrels of the Arians, which arose at
this time, gave Constantine, by the council of Nice, 325, the opportunity
he wished for, of making good his authority in religious
legislation.

7. The removal of the seat of empire from
Rome to Constantinople was connected with this
change in the form of worship&mdash;as a Christian
court would have been awkwardly situated in a
city still altogether pagan&mdash;although the need
there was of protecting the frontiers against the
Goths and Persians had a considerable share[Pg 460]
therein. It did, indeed, become the principal
means of establishing the despotism of the court;
but those who regard it as one of the causes of
the decline of the empire, should remember, that
for an empire fallen so low as the Roman was at
this time, despotism was almost the only support
that remained.

The various partitions of the empire from the time of Diocletian,
had led the way to this change of the capital; because a
natural result of that system was, that the emperors and C&aelig;sars,
when not with the army as they usually were, would reside in
different cities. The seat of Diocletian's government was at
Nicomedia; of Maximian's, at Milan; even Constantine himself
remained but very little at Rome. In these new residences they
felt themselves unfettered; and therefore, although the Roman
senate existed till after the time of Constantine, its authority
must have fallen of itself from the time of Diocletian.

8. We ought not, therefore, to wonder that the
consequence of this removal was so complete a
change in the whole form of government, that
after a short time it seemed to be altogether a
different state. A partition of the empire was
made, which, though it might in part have been
founded on those which had previously existed,
was yet so different, that it not only changed the
ancient divisions of the provinces, but completely
altered their mode of government.&mdash;The court,
with the exception of polygamy, assumed entirely
the form of an eastern court.&mdash;A revolution also
had taken place in the military system, by the
complete separation of the civil and military authorities,
which the pr&aelig;torian pr&aelig;fects had hitherto
possessed, but who now became merely
civil governors.

According to the new division the whole empire was divided
into four pr&aelig;fectures, each of which had its dioceses, and each[Pg 461]
diocese its provinces. The pr&aelig;fectures were: I. The eastern
(pr&aelig;fectura Orientis); it contained five dioceses; 1. Orientis;
2. &AElig;gypti; 3. Asi&aelig;; 4. Ponti; 5. Thraci&aelig;; forming altogether
forty-eight provinces, and comprising all the countries of
Asia and Egypt, together with the frontier countries of Libya
and Thrace. II. Pr&aelig;fectura Illyrici, containing two dioceses;
1. Macedoni&aelig;; 2. Daci&aelig;; forming eleven provinces, and comprising
M&#339;sia, Macedon, Greece, and Crete. III. Pr&aelig;fectura
Itali&aelig;, containing three dioceses; 1. Itali&aelig;; 2. Illyrici; 3.
Afric&aelig;; forming twenty-nine provinces, and comprising Italy,
the countries on the south of the Danube, as far as the boundaries
of M&#339;sia; the islands of Sicily, Sardinia, and Corsica, and
the African provinces of the Syrtis. IV. Pr&aelig;fectura Galliarum,
containing three dioceses; 1. Galli&aelig;; 2. Hispani&aelig;; 3.
Britanni&aelig;; forming altogether twenty-eight provinces, and comprising
Spain and the Balearian islands, Gaul, Helvetia, and
Britain.&mdash;Each of these pr&aelig;fectures was under a pr&aelig;fectus pr&aelig;torio
(pr&aelig;torian pr&aelig;fect), but who was merely a civil governor,
and had under him vicarios, in the dioceses, as well as the rectores
provinciarum, of various ranks and titles. They were
named proconsules pr&aelig;sides, etc. Besides these, Rome and Constantinople,
not being included in any of the four pr&aelig;fectures,
had each its pr&aelig;fect.

As principal officers of state and the court (s. cubiculi), we
now for the first time meet with the pr&aelig;positus s. cubiculi
(grand-chamberlain), under whom were all the comites palatii
and cubicularii, in four divisions; these, at a later period, were
frequently eunuchs of great influence; the magister officiorum
(chancellor, minister of the interior); the comes sacrarum largitiorum
(minister of the finances); the qu&aelig;stor (the organ of the
emperors in legislation; minister of justice and secretary of
state); the comes rei principis (minister of the crown-treasury)
[privy-purse]; the two comites domesticorum (commander of the
household guards), each of whom had his corps (scholas) under
him. The number of the state officers and courtiers was continually
increasing. If the good of a commonwealth consisted in
forms, ranks, and titles, the Roman empire must at this time
have been truly happy!

At the head of the troops were the magistri peditum (masters
of the infantry) and the magistri equitum (masters of the horse),
under the magister utriusque milit&aelig; (general in chief of the
whole army). Their subordinate commanders were called comites
[Pg 462]and duces. Constantine considerably reduced the army. In the
arrangement of the troops he also made great alterations; these,
however, were but of slight consequence compared with that
which was produced by admitting into the service a continually
increasing number of barbarians.

Taxes.

9. It would naturally be expected that these
great changes should lead to others in the system
of taxation. New taxes, or old ones revived,
were added to those already existing, and became,
by the manner in which they were collected,
doubly oppressive. We shall particularly notice,
a. The annual land-tax (indictio). b. The tax
upon trade (aurum lustrale). c. The free gift (don.
gratuit.), now grown into an obligatory tax (aurum
coronarium). To these we must add the municipal
expenses, which fell entirely upon the citizens,
and especially upon the civic officers (decuriones),
places which must have been generally held by
the rich, as Constantine had in great measure appropriated
the wealth of the cities to the endowment
of churches, and the support of the clergy.

a. The land-tax, or indiction, which if not first introduced by
Constantine was entirely regulated under him, was collected after
an exact register, or public valuation, of all the landed estates.
Its amount was yearly fixed and prescribed by the emperor (indicebatur),
and levied by the rectors of provinces and the decurions;
an arbitrary standard (caput) being taken as the rate
of assessment.

As this register was probably reviewed every fifteen years, it
gave rise to the cycle of indictions of fifteen years, which became
the common era, beginning from September 1, 312. In this
manner the tax included all those who were possessed of property.
b. The tax on commerce; which was levied on almost
every kind of trade. It was collected every four years, whence
the aurum lustrale. c. The aurum coronarium grew out of the[Pg 463]
custom which obtained of presenting the emperors with golden
crowns on particular occasions; the value of which was at last
exacted in money.  Every considerable city was obliged to
pay it.

Spread of
the Christian
religion.

10.  The rapid spread of the Christian religion,
the promulgation of which was enforced as a
duty upon all its professors, was now accelerated
by the endeavours of the court. Constantine forbade
sacrifices, and shut up the temples; and the
violent zeal of his successors unfortunately soon
turned them into ruins.

1817. With several very learned appendixes, which clear up
some particular points.

Constantine,
Constantius
and Constans.

11.  The three C&aelig;sars and sons of Constantine
the Great, Constantine, 337&mdash;340; Constantius,
337&mdash;361; and Constans, 337&mdash;350; had been
carefully educated, and yet resembled one another
as much in their vices as they did in their names.
They indeed divided the empire again upon the
death of their father; but were so eager after
territory, which neither of them was qualified to
govern, that a series of wars followed for the
next twelve years, till at last Constantius was left
master of the whole; and by the murder of most
of his relations secured the throne to himself.

In the partition of the empire Constantine obtained the pr&aelig;fectura
Galliarum, Constans the pr&aelig;fectura Itali&aelig; et Illyrici,
and Constantius the pr&aelig;fectura Orientis. But as Constantine
desired to add Italy and Africa to his portion, he attacked[Pg 464]
Constans, and thereby lost his life, so that Constans came into
thee possession of the western countries. In consequence, however,
of his wretched misgovernment, Magnentius, a general,
proclaimed himself emperor in Gaul, and Constans was slain
in endeavouring to escape, 350. A war with Constantius, who
was then occupied in the east, became inevitable, and broke out
351. The usurper was defeated first at Mursa in Pannonia,
then retreating into Gaul he was again defeated, 353; upon
which he slew himself, together with his family.

Constantius alone.

354.

12. As Constantius, however&mdash;sunk in effeminacy
and debauchery, and surrounded and governed
by eunuchs&mdash;was unable to sustain the
weight of government alone, he took his cousin
Constantius Gallus, hitherto a state prisoner, and
whose father he had formerly slain, to his assistance,
created him C&aelig;sar, and sent him into the
east against the Parthians. But his excessive
arrogance, which was fomented by his wife Constantina,
rendered him so dangerous that Constantius
recalled him, and caused him, upon his
return, to be put to death in Istria. His younger
brother Fl. Julian, from whom the suspicious
Constantius believed he had nothing to fear, was
Nov. 6, 355.
promoted in his place, created C&aelig;sar, and sent
to defend the frontiers on the Rhine. Although
Julian passed suddenly from study to warfare, he
not only fought against the Germans with success,
but also made a deep inroad into their country.
In the mean time Constantius, after his
generals had been beaten by the Persians, who
wished to reconquer the provinces they had
ceded, was preparing an expedition against them
in person, and with that view endeavoured gradually
to withdraw the troops of Julian, in consequence
of which the latter, suspecting his de[Pg 465]sign,
was induced to accept the diadem presented
361.
by his soldiers. While marching, however, along
the Danube against Constantius, he received information
of that prince's death in Asia.

Julian,
March, 360&mdash;June 25,
363.

13.  Fl. Julian, (the apostate,) who reigned from
his twenty-ninth to his thirty-second year, was
the last and most highly gifted prince of the house
of Constantine. Instructed by misfortunes and
study, he yet had some faults, though certainly
free from great vices. He began with reforming
the luxury of the court. His abjuration of the
religion now become dominant, and which he
wished to annihilate by degrees, was an error in
policy, which he must have discovered to his
cost had his reign been prolonged. Wishing,
however, to terminate the war against the Persians,
he penetrated as far as the Tigris, where
he lost his life in an engagement, after a reign of
three years.

14.  Fl. Jovianus, now thirty-three years of
age, was immediately raised to the purple by the
army. He concluded a peace with the Persians,
by which he restored them all the territory that
had been conquered from them since the year
297. After a short reign of eight months he was
carried off by a sudden disorder; and the army

and divided the empire by giving him the pr&aelig;fectura
Orientis, and retaining the rest for himself.[Pg 466]

Valentinian
Feb. 26,
364&mdash;Nov.
17, 375.

15. The reign of Valentinian I. in the east,
who, in the year 367, created his son Gratian
Augustus with himself, is distinguished by the
system of toleration which he followed with regard
to the affairs of religion, though in other
respects a cruel prince. Nearly the whole of his
reign was taken up in almost continual struggles
with the German nations, who had recovered
from the losses they had suffered under Julian.
His first efforts were directed against the Franks,
the Saxons, and the Alemanni on the Rhine;
and afterwards against the Quadi and other nations
on the Danube; where he died of apoplexy
at Guntz in Hungary.

Valens,
364&mdash;368.

16. In the mean time his brother Valens (aged
38&mdash;52 years) had to contend with a powerful
insurrection which had broken out in the east.
A certain Procopius had instigated the people to
this, by taking advantage of the discontent occasioned
by the oppression of Valens, who, having
adopted the opinion of the Arians, was more disliked
in the east than his brother was in the
373.
west. His war against the Persians ended with
a truce. But the most important event that happened
during his reign, was the entrance of the
Huns into Europe, which took place towards its
close. This in its turn gave rise to the great
popular migration, by which the Roman empire
in the west may properly be said to have been
overthrown. The immediate consequence was
the admission of the greater part of the Visigoths
into the Roman empire, and this occasioned a
war which cost Valens his life.

[Pg 467]The Huns, a nomad people of Asia, belonged to the great
Mongolian race. Having penetrated to the Don, 373, they
subdued the Goths upon that river as far as the Theiss. The
Goths, divided into Ostrogoths and Visigoths, were separated
from one another by the Dnieper. The former, driven from
their country, fell upon the Visigoths, in consequence of which
the emperor Valens was requested by the latter to grant them
admission into the Roman empire, and with the exception of
the Vandals, who had been seated in Pannonia from the time
of Constantine, they were the first barbarian nation that had
been settled within the boundaries of the empire. The scandalous
oppression of the Roman governor, however, drove them into
rebellion; and as Valens marched against them, he was defeated
near Adrianople and lost his life, 378.

Gratian,
375&mdash;383,
and

Valentinian II. 375&mdash;392.

17.  During these events, Gratian (aged 16&mdash;24
years) succeeded his father Valentinian I. in
the west, and immediately associated his brother,
Valentinian II. (aged 5&mdash;21 years) with himself
in the empire; giving him, though under his own
superintendence, the pr&aelig;fectura Itali&aelig; et Illyrici.
Gratian set forward to the assistance of his uncle
Valens against the Goths, but receiving on his
march an account of his defeat and death, and
fearing the east might fall a prey to the Goths,
he raised Theodosius, a Spaniard, who had already
distinguished himself as a warrior, to the
purple, and gave him the pr&aelig;fectura Orientis et
Illyrici.

Revolt of
Maximus,
383.

18.  The indolent reign of Gratian led to the
rebellion of Maximus, a commander in Britain,
who, crossing into Gaul, was so strongly supported
by the defection of the Gallic legions, that
Gratian was obliged to seek safety in flight. He
was, however, overtaken and put to death at
Lyons. By this event Maximus found himself
in possession of all the pr&aelig;fectura Galliarum;
and by promising Theodosius not to interfere
[Pg 468]with the young Valentinian II. in Italy, he prevailed
upon him to acknowledge him emperor.
But having broken his promise by the invasion of
Italy, he was defeated and made prisoner by
388.
Theodosius in Pannonia, and soon after executed.
Upon this Valentinian II. a youth of whom great
hopes were entertained, became again master
of all the west. But, unfortunately, he was murdered
by the offended Arbogast, his magister militum;
who, thereupon, raised to the throne his
own friend
Eugenius.
Eugenius, magister officiorum. Theodosius,
however, so far from acknowledging, declared
war against him and made him prisoner.
He himself thus became master of the whole empire,
but died in the following year.

Theodosius
the Great,
Jan. 19,
379&mdash;Jan.
17, 395.

19. The vigorous reign of Theodosius in the
east, from his thirty-fourth to his fiftieth year,
was not less devoted to politics than to religion.
The dexterity with which he at first broke the
power of the victorious Goths (though they still
preserved their quarters in the provinces on the
Danube), procured him considerable influence,
which the strength and activity of his character
enabled him easily to maintain. The blind zeal,
however, with which he persecuted Arianism,
now the prevailing creed in the east, and restored
the orthodox belief, as well as the persecutions
which he directed against the pagans and the
destruction of their temples, occasioned the most
dreadful convulsions. His efforts to preserve the
boundaries of the empire, not a province of which
was lost before his death, required an increase of
taxes; and however oppressive this might be, we
cannot impute it to the ruler as a crime. In an[Pg 469]
empire so enfeebled in itself, and which, nevertheless,
had powerful foes on every side to contend
with, it followed that every active reign
would be oppressive. Yet never before had the
internal depopulation of the empire made it necessary
to take so many barbarians into Roman
pay, as under this reign; whence naturally followed
a change in the arms and tactics of the
Roman armies.

1798, 2 vols. A very learned and in every respect excellent description
of the deeply-decayed Roman world as it now stood.

Final division
of the
Roman empire.

Arcadius,
395&mdash;408.

Honorius,
385&mdash;423.

20.  Theodosius left two sons, between whom
the empire was divided. Both parts, however,
were certainly considered as forming but one empire&mdash;an
opinion which afterwards prevailed, and
even till late in the middle ages had important
consequences&mdash;yet never since this period have
they been reunited under one ruler. The eastern
empire, comprising the pr&aelig;fectura Orientis et Illyrici,
was allotted to the eldest son, Arcadius (aged
18&mdash;31) under the guardianship of Rufinus the
Gaul. The western, or the pr&aelig;fectura Galliarum
et Itali&aelig;, to the younger, Honorius, aged 11&mdash;39,
under the guardianship of the Vandal Stilico.

Alaric king
of the Visigoths.

21.  The western empire, to the history of which
we shall now confine ourselves, suffered such
violent shocks during the reign of Honorius, as
made its approaching fall plainly visible. The
intrigues of Stilico to procure himself the government
of the whole empire, opened a way for the
Goths into its interior, just at a time when they
were doubly formidable, fortune having given
them a leader greatly superior to any they had
[Pg 470]hitherto had. Alaric king of the Visigoths established
himself and his people in the Roman empire,
became master of Rome, and mounted the
throne: it was the mere effect of chance that he
did not overthrow it altogether.

Both Honorius and Arcadius, especially the latter, belonged
to that class of men who never come to years of maturity; their
favourites and ministers therefore governed according to their
own inclination. Stilico, who made Honorius his son-in-law,
was not deficient, indeed, in abilities for governing; and his endeavour
to obtain the management of the whole empire, arose,
perhaps, from the conviction that it was necessary he should have
it. He could not, however, gain his object by intrigue; for after
the murder of Rufinus; 395, he found a still more powerful opponent
in the eunuch Eutropius, his successor in the east. Under
the regency of Stilico, Gaul, in consequence of its troops
being withdrawn to oppose Alaric, 400, was inundated by
German tribes&mdash;by Vandals, Alani, and Suevi&mdash;who from thence
penetrated even into Spain. Nevertheless, he preserved Italy
from their attacks by the victory which he gained, 403, over
Alaric at Verona; and again over Radagaisus, 405, who had advanced
with other German hordes as far as Florence. But
Stilico, having entered into a secret alliance with Alaric, for the
purpose of wresting eastern Illyrica from the empire of the east,
was overreached by the intrigues of the new favourite Olympius,
whose cabal knew how to take advantage of the weakness of
Honorius, and of the jealousy of the Roman and foreign soldiers.
Stilico was accused of aspiring to the throne, and was executed
August 23, 408. Rome lost in him the only general that was
left to defend her. Alaric invaded Italy the same year, 408, and
the besieged Rome was obliged to purchase peace; the conditions,
however, not being fulfilled, he was again, 409, before
Rome, became master of the city, and created Attalus, the pr&aelig;fect
of the city, emperor instead of Honorius, who had shut himself
up in Ravenna. In 410 he assumed the diadem; and,
making himself master of the city by force, gave it up to be
plundered by his troops. Soon afterwards, while projecting the
capture of Sicily and Africa, he died in lower Italy. His brother-in-law
and successor, Adolphus, together with his Goths, left
Italy, now completely exhausted, 412, went into Gaul, and from[Pg 471]
thence proceeding into Spain, founded there the empire of the
Visigoths: he carried with him, however, Placidia the sister of
Honorius, either as prisoner or as hostage, and married her in
Gaul. During these events an usurper arose in Britain and
Gaul named Constantine, 407: he was vanquished, and put to
death, 411, by Constantius, one of Honorius's generals. This
latter prince not only gave Constantius his sister Placidia, who
had become a widow and was restored in 417, in marriage, but
also named him Augustus in 421. He died, however, a few
months after, so that Placidia henceforward had a considerable
share in the government. She went nevertheless, 423, to Constantinople,
where she remained until the death of Honorius.

Schulze, 1805. Not written by way of comparison.

423.

425.

Valentinian
III. 425&mdash;455.

22. In this manner was a great part of Spain,
and part of Gaul, cut off from the Roman empire
during the reign of Honorius. After his death
the secretary John usurped the government, but
was defeated by the eastern emperor Theodosius
II. The nephew of Honorius, Valentinian III. a
minor (aged 6&mdash;36), was then raised to the throne,
under the guardian care of his mother Placidia
(&#8224; 450). Under his miserable reign the western
empire was stripped of almost all her provinces
with the exception of Italy. Yet the government
of his mother, and afterwards his own incapacity,
were as much the cause as the stormy
migration of barbarous tribes, which now convulsed
all Europe.

Britain had been voluntarily left by the Romans since 427.
In Africa, the governor Boniface having been driven into rebellion
by the intrigues of the Roman general &AElig;tius, who possessed
the ear of Placidia, invited the Vandals from Spain, under the
command of Genseric, to come to his assistance. The latter then
obtained possession of the country, 429&mdash;439; indeed, even as
early as 435, Valentinian was obliged to make a formal cession
of it to them. Valentinian's wife Eudoxia, a Grecian princess,[Pg 472]
was purchased by the cession of western Illyricum (Pannonia,
Dalmatia, and Noricum); so that of all the countries south of
the Danube there now only remained those which belonged to
the pr&aelig;fecture of Italy: Rh&aelig;tia and Vindelicia. On the south-east
of Gaul was formed, 435, the kingdom of the Burgundians,
which, besides the south-east part of France, comprised also
Switzerland and Savoy. The south-west was under the dominion
of the Visigoths. There remained only the territory north
of the Loire which still submitted to the Roman governors; the
last of whom, Syagrius, survived the fall of the empire itself;
holding out till the year 486, when he was defeated near Soissons
by Clodovicus, or Clovis, king of the Franks.

The Huns.

Attila.

450.

451.

453.

454.

455.

23. But while the western empire seemed thus
of itself almost to fall to pieces, another impetuous
rush of nations took place, which threatened the
whole of western Europe. The victorious hordes
of Huns who now occupied the territory formerly
the seat of the Goths, between the Don and the
Theiss, and even as far as the Volga, had united
themselves, since the year 444, under one common
chief, Attila; who, by this union and his
own superior talents as a warrior and ruler, became
the most powerful prince of his time. The
eastern empire having bought a peace by paying
him a yearly tribute, he fell with a mighty army
upon the western provinces. The united forces,
however, of the Romans under &AElig;tius and the Visigoths,
obliged him near Chalons (in campis Catalaunicis)
to retreat. Nevertheless, the following
year he again invaded Italy, where he had a
secret understanding with the licentious Honoria,
Valentinian's sister. The cause of his second retreat,
which was soon followed by his death, is
unknown. The miserable Valentinian soon after
deprived the Roman empire of its best general,
being led by his suspicions to put &AElig;tius to death.
[Pg 473]He himself, however, was soon doomed to undergo
the punishment of his debaucheries, being
murdered in a conspiracy formed by Petronius
Maximus, whose wife he had dishonoured, and
some friends of &AElig;tius, whom he had executed.

24. The twenty years which intervened between
the assassination of Valentinian, and the
final destruction of the Roman empire in the
west, was nearly one continued series of intestine
revolutions. No less than nine sovereigns rapidly
succeeded one another. These changes, indeed,
were but of little importance in this troublesome
period, compared to the terror with which Genseric
king of the Vandals filled the Roman empire:
he by his naval power having become master
of the Mediterranean and Sicily, could ravage
the coasts of the defenceless Italy at his pleasure,
and even capture Rome itself. While in Italy,
the German Ricimer, general of the foreign troops
in Roman pay, permitted a series of emperors to
reign in his name. It would have been his lot to
put an end to this series of Augusti, but for mere
accident, which reserved that glory for his son
and successor, Odoacer, four years after his father's
death.

After the death of Valentinian, Maximus was proclaimed emperor;
but as he wished to compel Eudoxia, Valentinian's
widow, to marry him, she called over Genseric from Africa, who
took and pillaged Rome, and Maximus perished after a reign of
three months, 455. He was succeeded by M. Avitus, who
ascended the throne at Arles; and he again was soon deposed
by Ricimer, 456, who, just before, had defeated the fleet of the
Vandals. Ricimer now placed upon the throne, first Julianus
Majorianus, April 1, 457; but he, having distinguished himself
in the wars against the Vandals, 461, was set aside, and Libius
Severus put in his place, who, however, died in 465, probably of[Pg 474]
poison. His death was followed by an interregnum of two years,
during which Ricimer ruled, though without the title of emperor.
At length the patrician Anthemius, then at Constantinople
(where they never gave up their pretensions to the right
of naming or confirming the sovereigns of the west), was, though
not without the consent of the powerful Ricimer, named emperor
of the west, April 12, 467, by the emperor Leo. But differences
having arisen between him and Ricimer, the latter retired to
Milan, 469, and commenced a war, in which he took and pillaged
Rome, and Anthemius was slain. Ricimer himself followed
soon after, &#8224; Aug. 18, 472. Upon this, Anicius Olybrius,
son-in-law of Valentinian III. was proclaimed Augustus, but
dying in three months, Oct. 472, Glycerius assumed the purple
at Ravenna, without, however, being acknowledged at Constantinople,
where they in preference named Julius Nepos Augustus.
The latter, in 474, having expelled Glycerius, became also in his
turn expelled by his own general Orestes, 475, who gave the
diadem to his son Romulus Momyllus, who, as the last in the
succession of Augusti, acquired the surname of Augustulus. In
476, however, Odoacer, the leader of the Germans in the Roman
pay at Rome, sent him, after the execution of Orestes, into captivity,
and allowed him a pension. Odoacer now remained master
of Italy till the year 492, when the Ostrogoths, under their king
Theodoric, founded there a new empire.

25. Thus fell the Roman empire of the west,
while that of the east, pressed on every side, and
in a situation almost similar, endured a thousand
years, notwithstanding its intestine broils, which
would alone have sufficed to destroy any other,
and the hosts of barbarians who attacked it
during the middle ages. The impregnable situation
of its capital, which usually decides the fate
of such kingdoms, joined to its despotism, which
is not unfrequently the main support of a kingdom
in its decline, can alone, in some measure,
explain a phenomenon which has no equal in the
history of the world.

APPENDIX.

CHRONOLOGY  OF  HERODOTUS  TO  THE  TIME  OF  CYRUS,  EXTRACTED
FROM  THE  RESEARCHES  OF  M.  VOLNEY.  See
Preface.


Although Herodotus did not write his work in
chronological order, yet we cannot doubt that he
had some general plan of computing time. By
carefully selecting and comparing the separate
data scattered through his work, this plan to a
certain extent may be traced out, and early history,
with regard to settled chronology, must necessarily
gain a good deal. The following essay
is founded upon a procedure of this kind; it is
drawn entirely from Herodotus, and only from
data which he has precisely determined, the passages
of his work being always referred to.

The year B. C. 561, in which the fall of Astyages
and the Median empire took place, as may
be proved from Herodotus himself, is a fixed point
of time from which we may ascend into higher
antiquity. This point of time may be determined
by the chronological data respecting the battle of
Marathon, four years before the death of Darius
(Herodotus VII. 1. 4.) agreeing with the general
data of the Greeks, who fix it in the third year of
the 72nd Olymp. B. C. 490. By adding to this
the thirty-two years of Darius's reign that had
already elapsed (Herodotus, ibid.), the eight
months of Smerdis (Herodotus, III. 68.), the
seven years and five months of Cambyses (He[Pg 476]rodotus
III. 66.), and the twenty-nine years of
Cyrus (Herodotus, I. 214.), we obtain the year
560 as the first year of Cyrus.


I. CHRONOLOGY OF THE MEDIAN EMPIRE.




B. C.
End of the Median empire561.
Duration of the Median empire one hundred and fifty-six years (Herodotus, I, 130.) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The beginning of it, therefore, after their separation from the Assyrians, would be717.
In this period, at first, six years of anarchy[a]716&mdash;710.
Reign of Deioces fifty-three years (Herodotus, I. 102.)710&mdash;657.
Reign of Phraortes, twenty-two years (ibid.)657&mdash;635.
Cyaxares, forty years (I. 106.)635&mdash;595.
Irruption and dominion of the Scythians, twenty-eight years (I. 203. 106.)625&mdash;598.
Conquest of Nineveh (I. 106.)597.
Astyages reigned thirty-five years (I. 130.)595&mdash;561.


[a] These are certainly not determined from Herodotus; but they remain after
subtracting the one hundred and fifty years' reign of the four Median kings.

The succession of Median kings given by Ctesias,
which entirely differs from this, the author
thinks might be explained by a duplication; see
&#8224; Gott. Gel. Anz. 1810, p. 4.


II. CHRONOLOGY OF THE ASSYRIAN EMPIRE.

The dominion of the Assyrians over Asia, or
their empire, ended with the revolt of the Medes
(Herodotus, I. 95.); although the existence of
their state did not then end, but terminated with
the capture of Nineveh by Cyaxares, B. C. 597.




B. C.
Revolt of the Medes, as above717.
The dominion of the Assyrians had endured five hundred and twenty years (Herodotus, I. 95.) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The Assyrian empire lasted therefore from1237&mdash;717.


[Pg 477]
As Herodotus intended to write the history of
this empire in a separate work (I. 184.), he only
casually mentions (I. 7.) its founder Ninus, who
began to reign 1237; and afterwards Sennacherib
and his expedition (II. 141.); and the last king,
Sardanapalus (II. 150.).

The mention of Sennacherib and his expedition
furnishes a point of time for comparing the chronology
of Herodotus with that of the Bible, or the
Jews. According to the latter, Sennacherib's expedition
took place B. C. 714. (see above, p. 26.);
his death takes place immediately after, and he
has for his successor Esar-haddon, 2 Kings, xix.
37. Here then is certainly a contradiction, since,
according to Herodotus, the Assyrian dominion
had ceased three years before, namely, 717. M.
Volney endeavours to reconcile this difficulty by
the restoration of an ancient reading in the sacred
text; according to which Amon, king of Jud&aelig;a,
reigned twelve years instead of two (2 Kings,
xxi. 10.); from which it would follow, that the
expedition of Sennacherib took place in 724.
As this would leave seven years after his death
for his successor Esar-haddon, who agrees both
in time and name with the Sardanapalus of the
Greeks (the Greek name being formed from
Esar-haddon-pal, i. e. Esar, the lord, son of Pal),
the two chronologies are thus made to agree
exactly. But even in following the ancient
usual reading, the greatest difference between
the two statements is only ten years; quite as
little as can be reasonably expected under such
circumstances.

With regard to the Assyrian chronology of[Pg 478]
Ctesias, M. Volney has satisfactorily shown that
it is full of contradictions, and unworthy of any
credit.


III. CHRONOLOGY OF THE LYDIAN EMPIRE.

The arrangement of the Lydian chronology
rests upon the settlement of two principal facts:
first, the great eclipse of the sun under Alyattes,
foretold by Thales (Herodotus, I. 74.); and
secondly, the conquest of Sardes, and overthrow
of the empire under Cr&#339;sus, by Cyrus; both of
which Herodotus certainly mentions, but without
assigning any precise date. But by a careful comparison
of all the data it has been proved, that
the great eclipse in Asia Minor (according to the
Tables of Pingr&eacute;) happened in the year 625; and
the conquest of Sardes, and the end of the Lydian
empire, B. C. 557, or in the fourth year of Cyrus.
Therefore:




B. C.
End of the Lydian empire557.


It subsisted under three houses; under that of
the Atyad&aelig; (fabulous and uncertain); under that
of the Heraclid&aelig;, five hundred and five years
(Herodotus, I. 7.); and under the last, that of the
Mermnad&aelig;, one hundred and seventy years.

The Heraclid&aelig; and Mermnad&aelig;, then, reigned
altogether six hundred and seventy-five years.
Therefore:




B. C.
Commencement of the reign of the Heraclid&aelig;, with Agron the son of Ninus (I. 7.)1232.
End of this house with the murder of Candaules, by Gyges727.


By fixings the time of Agron, son of Ninus,[Pg 479]
Herodotus verifies himself (I. 7.); as, by the preceding
data, Ninus began his reign in Assyria,
1237; consequently, it must have been in the
fifth year of his reign that he conquered Lydia,
and placed his son Agron upon the throne.




B. C.
Dominion of the Mermnad&aelig;, one hundred and seventy years, under kings of that house727&mdash;557.
Gyges, thirty-eight years (Herodotus, I. 14.)727&mdash;689.
Ardys, forty-nine years (Herodotus, I. 16.)689&mdash;640.
First irruption of the Cimmerians670.
Sadyattes, twelve years (Herodotus, I. 16.)640&mdash;628.
Alyattes, fifty-seven years (Herodotus, I. 25.)628&mdash;571.
War with Cyaxares, ending with the great eclipse, and second irruption of the Cimmerians &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 625.
Cr&#339;sus, fourteen years and fourteen days (Herodotus, I. 86.)571&mdash;557.


IV. CHRONOLOGY OF THE BABYLONIANS.

For this as well as for the Egyptians there is
no evidence to guide us, the data being very
scanty, and taken from Herodotus alone. The
chronology of the Babylonians, according to the
canon of Ptolemy, begins with Nabonassar, 747,
who was succeeded by twelve kings (mentioned
in the same canon), down to Nabopolassar; (see
above, p. 28.)




B. C.
Nabopolassar627&mdash;604.
Nebuchadnezzar604&mdash;561.
Evil-Merodach561&mdash;559.
Neriglissar559&mdash;555.
Labynetus555&mdash;538.
Conquest of Babylon by Cyrus &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 538.

[Pg 480]

V. CHRONOLOGY OF THE EGYPTIANS.

M. Volney very properly commences this with
the dodecarchy&mdash;as of the earlier periods only
the time of Sesostris, 1365, is ascertained;&mdash;and
arranges it in the following manner.



B. C.
Dodecarchy671&mdash;656.
Psammetichus's sole dominion thirty-nine years &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 656&mdash;617.
Reign of Neco, sixteen years617&mdash;601.
&mdash;&mdash; Psammis, six years601&mdash;595.
&mdash;&mdash; Apries, twenty-five years595&mdash;570.
&mdash;&mdash; Amasis, forty-four years570&mdash;526.
Psammenitus, six months525.
Conquest of Egypt by Cambyses

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.


*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at  a
href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that


You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.


1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit  a
href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:
www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
