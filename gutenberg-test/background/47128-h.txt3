The Adventures of Billy Topsail

"There was no need to invent conditions or imagine
situations. The life of any lad of Billy Topsail's
years up there is sufficiently romantic. It
is this skill in the portrayal of actual conditions
that lie ready to the hand of the intelligent observer
that makes Mr. Duncan's Newfoundland
stories so noteworthy."       Brooklyn Eagle.


Billy Topsail and Company

"Another rousing volume of 'The Billy Topsail
Books.' Norman Duncan has the real key to the
boy heart and in Labrador he has opened up a
field magnetic in its perils and thrills and endless
excitements."       Examiner.


Billy Topsail, M. D.



A Tale of Adventure with "Doctor Luke of the
Labrador."

The further adventures of Billy Topsail and
Archie Armstrong on the ice, in the forest and at
sea. In a singular manner the boys fall in with
a doctor of the outposts and are moved to join
forces with him. The doctor is Doctor Luke of
the Labrador whose prototype as every one knows
is Doctor Grenfell. Its pages are as crowded with
brisk adventures as those of the preceding books.

To the Reader


In this tale of the seas and ice-floes of Newfoundland
and Labrador, Billy Topsail adventures
with Doctor Luke of the Labrador.
There are thrilling passages in the book. The
author is frank to admit the hair-raising quality of
them. Indeed, they have tickled his own scalp.
Well, it is proper that the hair of the reader
should sometimes stand on end and his eyes pop
wide. The author would be a poor teller of tales
if he could not manage as much       a charlatan if
he did not. Yet these thrilling passages are not
the work of a saucy imagination, delighting in
shudders, no matter what, but are all decently
founded upon fact, true to the experience of the
coast, as many a Newfoundlander, boy and man,
could tell you.

Doctor Luke has often been mistaken for Doctor
Wilfred Grenfell of the Deep Sea Mission.
That should not be. No incident in this book
is a transcript from Doctor Grenfell's long and
heroic service. What Billy Topsail and Doctor[6]
Luke encounter, however, is precisely what the
Deep Sea Mission workers must encounter. It
should be said, too, that as the tale is told of the
spring of the year, when the ice breaks up and
the floes come drifting out of the north with
great storms, Newfoundland presents herself in
her worst mood. Yet the sun shines in Newfoundland,
tender enough in summer weather       there
are flowers on the hills and warm winds
on the sea; and such as learn to know the land
come quickly to love her for her beauty and for
her friendliness.

CHAPTER I



In Which It Is Hinted that Teddy Brisk Would
Make a Nice Little Morsel o' Dog Meat, and
Billy Topsail Begins an Adventure that Eventually
Causes His Hair to Stand on End
and Is Likely to Make the Reader's Do the
Same


One dark night in the fall of the year, the
trading-schooner Black Bat, of Ruddy
Cove, slipped ashore on the rocks of
Tight Cove, of the Labrador. She was frozen
fast before she could be floated. And that was
the end of her flitting about. It was the end,
too, of Billy Topsail's rosy expectation of an hilarious
return to his home at Ruddy Cove. Winter
fell down next day. A great wind blew with
snow and frost; and when the gale was blown
out       the sun out and the sky blue again       it
was out of the question to rip the Black Bat
out of her icy berth in Tight Cove Harbour and
put her on the tumbled way to Ruddy.

[16]

And that is how it came about that Billy Topsail
passed the winter at Tight Cove, with Teddy
Brisk, and in the spring of the year, when the ice
was breaking up, fell in with Doctor Luke of the
Labrador in a way that did not lack the aspects
of an adventure of heroic proportions. It was no
great hardship to pass the winter at Tight Cove:
there was something to do all the while       trapping
in the back country; and there was no
uneasiness at home in Ruddy Cove       a wireless
message from the station at Red Rock had informed
Ruddy Cove of the fate of the Black Bat
and the health and comfort of her crew.

And now for the astonishing tale of how
Doctor Luke and Billy Topsail fell in together              



When Doctor Luke made Tight Cove, of the
Labrador, in the course of his return to his little
hospital at Our Harbour, it was dusk. His dogs
were famished; he was himself worn lean with
near five hundred miles of winter travel, which
measured his northern round, and his komatik
(sled) was occupied by an old dame of Run-by-Guess
Harbour and a young man of Anxious
Bight. The destitute old dame of Run-by-[17]Guess
Harbour was to die of her malady in a
cleanly peace; the young man of Anxious Bight
was to be relieved of those remnants of a
shoulder and good right arm that an accidental
gunshot wound had left to endanger his life.

It was not fit weather for any man to be
abroad       a biting wind, a frost as cold as death,
and a black threat of snow; but Doctor Luke,
on this desperate business of healing, was in
haste, and the patients on the komatik were in
need too urgent for any dawdling for rest by
the way. Schooner Bay ice was to cross; he
would put up for the night       that was all; he
must be off at dawn, said he in his quick, high
way.

From this news little Teddy Brisk's mother
returned to the lamp-lit cottage by Jack-in-the-Box.
It was with Teddy Brisk's mother that
Billy Topsail was housed for the winter.

"Is I t' go, mum?" said Teddy.

Teddy Brisk's mother trimmed the lamp.

"He've a ol' woman, dear," she replied,
"from Run-by-Guess."

Teddy Brisk's inference was decided.

"Then he've room for me," he declared; "an'
I'm not sorry t' learn it."

[18]

"Ah, well, dear, he've also a poor young feller
from Anxious Bight."

Teddy Brisk nodded.

"That's all about that," said he positively.
"He've no room for me!"

Obviously there was no room for little Teddy
Brisk on Doctor Luke's komatik. Little Teddy
Brisk, small as he was, and however ingenious
an arrangement might be devised, and
whatever degree of compression might be attempted,
and no matter what generous measure
of patience might be exercised by everybody
concerned, including the dogs       little Teddy
Brisk of Tight Cove could not be stowed away
with the old dame from Run-by-Guess Harbour
and the young man of Anxious Bight.

There were twenty miles of bay ice ahead;
the dogs were footsore and lean; the komatik
was overflowing       it was out of the question.
Nor could Teddy Brisk, going afoot, keep pace
with the Doctor's hearty strides and the speed
of the Doctor's team       not though he had the
soundest little legs on the Labrador, and the
longest on the Labrador, of his years, and the
sturdiest, anywhere, of his growth.

As a matter of fact, one of Teddy Bris[19]k's
legs was as stout and willing as any ten-year-old
leg ever you saw; but the other had gone
bad       not so recently, however, that the keen
Doctor Luke was deceived in respect to the
trouble, or so long ago that he was helpless to
correct it.

Late that night, in the lamp-lit cottage by
Jack-in-the-Box, the Doctor looked over the bad
leg with a severely critical eye; and he popped
more questions at Teddy Brisk, as Teddy Brisk
maintained, than had ever before been exploded
on anybody in the same length of time.

"Huh!" said he at last. "I can fix it."

"You can patch un up, sir?" cried Skipper
Tom.

This was Thomas Brisk. The father of Teddy
Brisk had been cast away, with the Brotherly
Love, on the reef by Fly Away Head, in the
Year of the Big Shore Catch. This old Thomas
was his grandfather.

"No, no, no!" the Doctor complained. "I
tell you I can fix it!"

"Will he be as good as new, sir?" said Teddy.

"Will he?" the Doctor replied. "Aha!" he
laughed. "You leave that to the carpenter."

"As good as Billy Topsail's off shank?"

[20]

"I'll scrape that bad bone in there," said the
Doctor, rubbing his hands in a flush of professional
expectation; "and if it isn't as good as
new when the job's finished I'll       I'll       why, I'll
blush, my son: I'll blush all red and crimson
and scarlet."

Teddy Brisk's mother was uneasy.

"Will you be usin' the knife, sir?"

"The knife? Certainly!"

"I'm not knowin'," said the mother, "what
little Teddy will say t' that."

"What say, son?" the Doctor inquired.

"Will it be you that's t' use the knife?" asked
Teddy.

"Mm-m!" said the Doctor. He grinned and
twinkled. "I'm the butcher, sir."

Teddy Brisk laughed. "That suits me!"
said he.

"That's hearty!" the Doctor exclaimed. He
was delighted. The trust was recompense.
God knows it was welcome! "I'll fix you,
Teddy boy," said he, rising. And to Skipper
Thomas: "Send the lad over to the hospital as
soon as you can, Skipper Thomas. When the
ice goes out we'll be crowded to the roof at
Our Harbour. It's the same way every spring.[21]
Egad! they'll sweep in like the flakes of the first
fall of snow! Now's the time. Make haste!
We must have this done while I've a cot to
spare."

"I will, sir."

"We're due for a break-up soon, I suppose       any
day now; but this wind and frost will hold
the ice in the bay for a while. You can slip the
lad across any day. It must be pretty fair going
out there. You can't bring him yourself, Skipper
Thomas. Who can? Somebody here? Timothy
Light? Old Sam's brother, isn't he? I
know him. It's all arranged, then. I'll be looking
for the lad in a day or two. You've plenty
of dogs in Tight Cove, haven't you?"

"Oh, aye, sir," Skipper Thomas replied;
"we've dogs, sir       never you mind about that!"

"Whose dogs?"

"Timothy Light's dogs."

The Doctor grinned again.

"That pack!" said he.

"A saucy pack o' dogs!" said Teddy's mother.
"It's mostly new this season. I don't like un!
I'm fair afraid o' them, sir. That big Cracker,
sir, that Timothy haves for bully an' leader       he've
fair spoiled Timothy Light's whole team.[22]
I'm none too fond o' that great dog, sir; an' I'll
have my say about it."

Skipper Thomas laughed       as a man will at a
woman's fears.

"No sheep's manners t' that pack," he
drawled. "The team's all dawg."

"What isn't wolf!" the woman retorted.

"She've been afraid o' that Cracker," Skipper
Thomas explained, "ever since he fetched a
brace o' wolves out o' the timber. 'Twas as
queer a sight, now, as ever you seed, sir. They
hung round the harbour for a day an' a night.
You might think, sir, that Cracker was showin'
off his new quarters t' some friends from the
back country. They two wolves seemed t' have
knowed Cracker all their lives. I 'low that they
had knowed              "

"He's half wolf hisself."

"I 'low he's all wolf," Skipper Thomas admitted.
This was not true. Cracker was not all
wolf. "I never heard o' nobody that knowed
where Cracker was born. That dog come in
from the timber."

"A wicked crew       the pack o' them!"

"We've had a lean winter at Tight Cove, sir,"
said Skipper Thomas. "The dogs have gone[23]
marvellous hungry this past month, sir. They're
just a wee bit savage."

"Spare your dog meat if you lack it," the
Doctor advised. "I'll feed that team at Our
Harbour."

Teddy Brisk put in:

"Timothy Light haves command o' that
pack."

"I'm not so sure that he've command," Teddy
Brisk's mother protested. "I'm not so sure that
any man could command a shockin' pack like
that. In case o' accident, now              "

Skipper Thomas chucked his ample, glowing
daughter-in-law under the chin.

"You loves that lad o' yourn!" he bantered.

"I does!"

"You're thinkin' he'd make a nice little morsel
o' dog meat?"

"As for me," she laughed, "I could eat him!"

She caught little Teddy Brisk in her arms and
kissed him all over his eager little face. And
then Doctor Luke, with a laugh and a boyish
"So long, Teddy Brisk! See you soon, old
soldier!" vanished to his lodgings for the night.

CHAPTER II



In Which Timothy Light's Team of Ten Potential
Outlaws is Considered, and There is a Significant
Description of the Career of a Blood-Guilty,
Ruined Young Dog, Which is in the Way of
Making Desperate Trouble for Somebody


Of all this Billy Topsail had been an
observer. To a good deal of it he had
listened with an awakened astonishment.
It did not appear to him that he would
be concerned in what might grow out of the
incident. He did not for a moment imagine, for
example, that he would find himself in a situation
wherein his hair would stand on end       that
he would stand stripped naked in the north wind,
confronting Death in a most unpleasant form.
Nor was it that Doctor Luke's personality had
stirred him to admiration       though that was
true: for Doctor Luke had a hearty, cheery
twinkling way with him, occasionally mixed with
a proper austerity, that would have won any
boy's admiration; but what particularly engaged
Billy Topsail was something else       it was Doctor[25]
Luke's confident assertion that he could cure little
Teddy Brisk.

Billy Topsail knew something of doctors,
to be sure; but he had never before quite
realized their power; and that a man, being
only human, after all, could take a knife in his
hand, which was only a man's hand, after all,
and so employ the knife that the painful, hampering
leg of Teddy Brisk, which had placed a
dreadful limitation on the little boy, would be
made whole and useful again, caused Billy Topsail
a good deal of deep reflection. If Doctor
Luke could do that, why could not Billy Topsail
learn to do it? It seemed to Billy Topsail to be
a more admirable thing to be able to do than to
sail a hundred-tonner in a gale of wind.

"Who is that man?" he asked.

"That's Doctor Luke," said Teddy's mother.
"You know that."

"Well, who's Doctor Luke?"

"I don't know. He's jus' Doctor Luke.
He've a wee hospital at Our Harbour. An' he
heals folk. You'll find un go anywhere he's
asked t' go if there's a poor soul in need. An'
that's all I know about un."

"What does he do it for?"

[26]

"I reckon he wants to. An' anyhow, I'm glad
he does do it. An' I reckon you'd be glad, too,
if you had a little boy like Teddy."

"I am glad!" said Billy. "I think 'tis the
most wonderful thing ever I heard of. An' I
wish              "

And the course of Billy Topsail's life moved
inevitably on towards a nearing fate that he
would have shuddered to contemplate had he
foreseen it.



Well, now, there was but one team of dogs in
Tight Cove. It was a happy circumstance. No
dogs could have existed as a separate pack in
the neighbourhood of Timothy Light's mob of
potential outlaws. It was all very well for Timothy
Light to pleasure his hobby and pride in
the unsavoury collection. Timothy Light had
command of his own team. It was quite another
matter for the timid mothers of Tight Cove.
Timothy Light's dogs had a bad name. As
neighbours they deserved it, whatever their
quality on the trail       a thieving, snarling crew.

To catch Timothy Light in the act of feeding
his team was enough to establish an antipathy
in the beholder       to see the old man beat off the[27]
rush of the pack with a biting walrus whip while
he spread the bucket of frozen fish; to watch
him, then, leap away from the ferocious onset;
and to be witness of the ravenous anarchy of the
scramble       a free fight, dwindling, at last, to
melancholy yelps and subsiding in the licking
of the small wounds of the encounter. Timothy
Light was a fancier of dog flesh, as a man may
be devoted to horse-flesh; and the object of his selective
taste was what he called go-an'-gumption.

"The nearer the wolf," said he, "the better
the dog."

It was to accord with this theory       which is a
fallacy as a generalization       that he had evolved
the team of ten that he had.

"I'm free t' say," he admitted, "that this here
Cracker o' mine is none too tame. He've the
wolf in him       that's so. As a wolf, with the pack
in the timber, he'd be a bad wolf; as a dog in
harbour he's a marvellous wicked rogue. He've
a eye as bitter as frost. Did you mark it? He
leaves it fool all over a person in a laughin' sort
o' fashion an' never stop on the spot he really
wants t' look at       except jus' once in a while.
An' then it darts t' the throat an' away again;
an' Cracker thinks, jus' as plain as speech:

[28]

"'Oh, Lord, wouldn't I like t' fix my teeth in
there!'

"Still an' all," the old man concluded, "he
yields t' command. A tap on the snout goes a
long way with Cracker. He've a deal o' wolf's
blood       that one has; but he's as big a coward,
too, as a wolf, an' there's no danger in him when
he's overmastered. Still an' all"       with a shrug       "I'd
not care t' lose my whip an' stumble an'
fall on the trail in the dusk when he haven't been
fed for a while."



Cracker had come to Tight Cove in a dog
trade of questionable propriety. Cracker had
not at once taken to the customs and dogs of
Tight Cove; he had stood off, sullen, alert, still       head
low, king-hairs lifted, eyes flaring. It
was an attitude of distrust, dashed with melancholy,
rather than of challenge. Curiosity alone
maintained it through the interval required for
decision. Cracker was deliberating.

There was Tight Cove and a condition of
servitude to Timothy Light; there were the free,
wild, famishing spaces of the timber beyond.
Cracker must choose between them.

All at once, then, having brooded himself to a[29]
conclusion, Cracker began to wag and laugh in
a fashion the most ingratiating to be imagined:
and thereupon he fought himself to an established
leadership of Timothy Light's pack, as
though to dispose, without delay, of that necessary
little preliminary to distinction. And subsequently
he accepted the mastery of Timothy
Light and fawned his way into security from the
alarmed abuse of the harbour folk; and eventually
he settled himself comfortably into the routine
of Tight Cove life.

There were absences. These were invariably
foreshadowed, at first, by yawning and a wretched
depth of boredom. Cracker was ashamed of his
intentions. He would even attempt to conceal
his increasing distaste for the commonplaces of
an existence in town by a suspiciously subservient
obedience to all the commands of Timothy
Light. It was apparent that he was preparing
for an excursion to the timber; and after
a day or two of whimpering restlessness he
would vanish.

It was understood, then, that Cracker was off
a-visiting of his cronies. Sometimes these absences
would be prolonged. Cracker had been
gone a month       had been caught, once, in a dis[30]tant
glance, with a pack of timber wolves, from
whom he had fled to hiding, like a boy detected
in bad company. Cracker had never
failed, however, to return from his abandoned
course, in reasonable season, as lean and ragged
as a prodigal son, and in a chastened mood, to
the respectability and plenty of civilization, even
though it implied an acquiescence in the exigency
of hard labour.

Timothy Light excused the dog.

"He've got t' have his run abroad," said he.
"I 'low that blood is thicker than water."

Cracker had a past. Timothy Light knew
something of Cracker's past. What was respectable
he had been told, with a good deal of
elaboration       concerning Cracker's feats of endurance
on the long trail, for example, accomplished
with broken shoes, or no shoes at all,
and bloody, frosted feet; and relating, with
warm, wide-eyed detail of a persuasively conscientious
description, to Cracker's cheerful resistance
of the incredible pangs of hunger on a
certain celebrated occasion.

Moreover, Cracker was a bully of parts.
Cracker could bully a discouraged team into a
forlorn endeavour of an amazing degree of power[31]
and courage. "As clever a dog as ever you
seed, sir! No shirkin'       ecod!       with Cracker t'
keep watch on the dogs an' snap at the heels
an' haunches o' the loafers." It was all true:
Cracker was a powerful, clever, masterful, enduring
beast in or out of harness, and a merciless
driver of the dogs he led and had mastered.

"Give the devil his due!" Timothy Light insisted.

What was disreputable in Cracker's past       in
the course of the dog trade of questionable propriety
referred to       Timothy Light had been left
to exercise his wit in finding out for himself.
Cracker was from the north       from Jolly Cove,
by the Hen-an'-Chickens. And what Timothy
Light did not know was this: Cracker had there
been concerned in an affair so doubtful, and of a
significance so shocking, that, had the news of it
got abroad in Tight Cove, the folk would have
taken the customary precaution as a defensive
measure, in behalf of the children on the roads
after dark, and as a public warning to all the
dogs of Tight Cove, of hanging Cracker by the
neck until he was dead.

Long John Wall, of Jolly Cove, on the way to
the Post at Little Inlet, by dog team, in January[32]
weather, had been caught by the snow between
Grief Head and the Tall Old Man; and Long
John Wall had perished on the ice       they found
his komatik and clean bones in the spring of the
year; but when the gale blew out, Long John
Wall's dogs had returned to Jolly Cove in a
fawning humour and a suspiciously well-fed condition.

The Jolly Cove youngster, the other party to
the dog trade, neglected to inform Timothy
Light       whose eyes had fallen enviously on the
smoky, taut, splendid brute       that this selfsame
Cracker which he coveted had bullied and led
Long John Wall's team on that tragic and indubitably
bloody occasion.

His philosophy was ample to his need.

"In a dog trade," thought he with his teeth
bare, when the bargain was struck, "'tis every
man for hisself."

And so this blood-guilty, ruined young dog
had come unsuspected to Tight Cove.



[33]




CHAPTER III



In Which Timothy Light's Famished Dogs Are
Committed to the Hands of Billy Topsail and
a Tap on the Snout is Recommended in the
Probable Case of Danger


It is no great trick to make Tight Cove of
the Labrador from the sea. There is no
chart, of course. Nor is any chart of the
little harbours needed for safe sailing, as long as
the songs of the coast are preserved in the heads
of the skippers that sail it. And so you may lay
with confidence a bit west of north from the Cape
Norman light       and raise and round the Scotchman's
Breakfast of Ginger Head: whereupon
a straightaway across Schooner Bay to the
Thimble, and, upon nearer approach to the
harbour water of the Cove       


When Bill Pott's P'int you is abreast,
Dane's Rock bears due west;
An' west-nor'west you must steer,
'Til Brimstone Head do appear.

The tickle's narrow, not very wide;
The deepest water's on the starboard side;
When in the harbour you is shot,
Four fathoms you has got       

[34]
and there you are: harboured within stone's
throw of thirty hospitable cottages, with their
stages and flakes clustered about, like offspring,
and all clinging to the cliffs with the grip of a
colony of mussels. They encircle the quiet,
deep water of the Cove, lying in a hollow of
Bill Pott's Point, Dane's Rock, and the little
head called Brimstone.

Winter was near done, at Tight Cove, when
Doctor Luke made the lights of the place from
the north. Presently the sun and southwesterly
winds of spring would spread the coast with all
the balmy, sudden omens of summer weather,
precisely as the first blast from the north, in a
single night of the fall of the year, had blanketed
the land with snow, and tucked it in, with enduring
frost, for the winter to come. With these
warm winds, the ice in Schooner Bay would
move to sea, with the speed of a thief in flight.
It would break up and vanish in a night, with all
that was on it (including the folk who chanced
to be caught on it)       a great, noisy commotion,
and swift clearing out, this removal to the open.

And the ice would drift in, again, with contrary
winds, and choke the bay, accompanied by
Arctic ice from the current beyond, and depart[35]
and come once more, and take leave, in a season
of its own willful choosing, for good and all.
When Doctor Luke made off across the bay,
leaving Teddy Brisk to follow, by means of
Timothy Light's komatik and scrawny dogs,
Schooner Bay had already gone rotten, in a
spell of southerly weather. The final break-up
was restrained only by an interval of unseasonable
frost.

A favourable wind would tear the field loose
from the cliffs and urge it to sea.



Teddy Brisk could not go at once to Doctor
Luke's hospital at Our Harbour. There came a
mild spell       the wind went to the south and west
in the night; a splashing fall of tepid southern
rain swept the dry white coats in gusts and a
melting drizzle; and, following on these untimely
showers, a day or two of sunshine and
soft breezes set the roofs smoking, the icicles dissolving,
the eaves running little streams of water,
the cliffs dripping a promise of shy spring
flowers, and packed the snow and turned the
harbour roads to slush, and gathered pools and
shallow lakes of water on the rotting ice of the bay.

Schooner Bay was impassable; the trail was[36]
deep and sticky and treacherous       a broken, rotten,
imminently vanishing course. And sea-ward,
in the lift of the waves, vast fragments of
the field were shaking themselves free and floating
off; and the whole wide body of ice, from
Rattle Brook, at the bottom of the bay, to the
great heads of Thimble and the Scotchman's
Breakfast, was striving to break away to the open
under the urge of the wind.

Teddy Brisk's adventure to Our Harbour must
wait for frost and still weather; and wait it did       until
in a shift of the weather there came a day
when all that was water was frozen stiff overnight,
and the wind fell away to a doubtful calm,
and the cliffs of Ginger Head were a loom in the
frosty distance across the bay.

"Pack that lad, mum," said Skipper Thomas
then. "'Tis now or never."

"I don't like the look of it," the mother complained.

"I warns you, mum       you're too fond o' that
lad."

"I'm anxious. The bay's rotten. You knows
that, sir       a man as old as you. Another southerly
wind would shatter              "

"Ecod! You'll coddle that wee lad t' death."

[37]

Teddy Brisk's mother laughed.

"Not me!" said she.

A cunning idea occurred to Skipper Thomas.

"Or cowardice!" he grumbled.

Teddy Brisk's mother started. She stared in
doubt at old Skipper Thomas. Her face clouded.
She was grim.

"I'd do nothin' so wicked as that, sir," said
she. "I'll pack un up."



It chanced that Timothy Light was sunk in a
melancholy regard of his physical health when
Skipper Thomas went to arrange for the dogs.
He was discovered hugging a red-hot bogie in
his bachelor cottage of turf and rough-hewn
timber by the turn to Sunday-School Hill. And
a woebegone old fellow he was: a sight to stir
pity and laughter       with his bottles and plasters,
his patent-medicine pamphlets, his drawn,
gloomy countenance, and his determination to
"draw off" the indisposition by way of his
lower extremities with a plaster of renowned
power.

"Nothin' stronger, Skipper Thomas, knowed
t' the science o' medicine an' the"       Skipper
Timothy did not hesitate over the obstacle       "the[38]
prac-t'-tie-on-ers thereof," he groaned; "an' she've
begun t' pull too. Ecod! but she's drawin'!
Mm-m-m! There's power for you! An' if she
don't pull the pain out o' the toes o' my two
feet"       Skipper Timothy's feet were swathed in
plaster; his pain was elsewhere; the course of its
exit was long       "I'm free t' say that nothin' will
budge my complaint. Mm-m! Ecod! b'y, but
she've sure begun t' draw!"

Skipper Timothy bade Skipper Thomas sit
himself down, an' brew himself a cup o' tea, an'
make himself t' home, an' feel free o' the place,
the while he should entertain and profit himself
with observing the operation of the plaster of
infallible efficacy in the extraction of pain.

"What's gone wrong along o' you?" Skipper
Thomas inquired.

"I been singin' pretty hearty o' late," Skipper
Timothy moaned       he was of a musical turn and
given frequently to a vigorous recital of the
Psalms and Paraphrases       "an' I 'low I've
strained my stummick."

Possibly Skipper Timothy could not distinguish,
with any degree of scientific accuracy,
between the region of his stomach and the region
of his lungs       a lay confusion, perhaps, in the[39]
matter of terms and definite boundaries; he had
been known to mistake his liver for his heart in
the indulgence of a habit of pessimistic diagnosis.
And whether he was right in this instance or not,
and whatever the strain involved in his vocal
effort, which must have tried all the muscles concerned,
he was now coughing himself purple in
the face       a symptom that held its mortal implication
of the approach of what is called the
lung trouble and the decline.

The old man was not fit for the trail       no
cruise to Our Harbour for him next day; he was
on the stocks and out of commission. Ah, well,
then, would he trust his dogs? Oh, aye; he
would trust his team free an' willin'. An' might
Billy Topsail drive the team? Oh, aye; young
Billy Topsail might drive the team an' he had the
spirit for the adventure. Let Billy Topsail keep
un down       keep the brutes down, ecod!       and no
trouble would come of it.

"A tap on the snout t' mend their manners,"
Skipper Timothy advised. "A child can overcome
an' manage a team like that team o' ten."

And so it was arranged that Billy Topsail
should drive Teddy Brisk to Our Harbour next
day.



[40]




CHAPTER IV


In Which the Komatik is Foundered, the Dogs
Draw Their Own Conclusions from the Misfortune
and Prepare to Take Advantage,
Cracker Attempts a Theft and Gets a Clip on
the Snout, and Billy Topsail and Teddy Brisk
Confront a Situation of Peril with Composure,
Not Knowing the Ultimate Disaster that Impends


Billy Topsail was now sixteen years
old       near seventeen, to be exact; and he
was a lusty, well-grown lad, who might
easily have been mistaken for a man, not only
because of his inches, but because of an assured,
competent glance of the eye. Born at
Ruddy Cove of Newfoundland, and the son of a
fisherman, he was a capable chap in his native
environment. And what natural aptitude he
possessed for looking after himself in emergencies
had been developed and made more
courageous and acute by the adventurous life he
had lived       as anybody may know, indeed, who
cares to peruse the records of those incidents as
elsewhere set down. As assistant to the clerk[41]
of the trader Black Bat, he had served well; and
it is probable that he would some day have been
a clerk himself, and eventually a trader, had not
the adventure upon which he was embarking
with Teddy Brisk interrupted his career by opening
a new vista for his ambition.



Billy Topsail and Teddy Brisk set out in blithe
spirits for Doctor Luke's hospital at Our Harbour.
A dawn of obscure and disquieting
significance; a hint of milder weather in the
growing day; a drear, gray sky thickening to
drab and black, past noon; a puff of southerly
wind and a slosh of rain; a brisk gale, lightly
touched with frost, running westerly, with snow,
in a close, encompassing cloud of great wet
flakes; lost landmarks; dusk falling, and a black
night imminent, with high wind       and Billy
Topsail's team of ten went scrambling over an
unexpected ridge and foundered the komatik.

It was a halt       no grave damage done; it was
nothing to worry a man       not then.

Young Billy Topsail laughed; and little Teddy
Brisk chuckled from the tumbled depths of his
dogskin robes; and the dogs, on their haunches
now, a panting, restless half-circle       the Labrador[42]
dogs run in individual traces       viewed the spill
with shamefaced amusement. Yet Billy Topsail
was confused and lost. Snow and dusk were
impenetrable; the barricades and cliffs of Ginger
Head, to which he was bound, lay somewhere in
the snow beyond       a mere general direction. It
is nothing, however, to be lost. Daylight and
clearing weather infallibly disclose the lay of the
land.

A general direction is good enough; a
man proceeds confidently on the meager advantage.

It was interesting for the dogs       this rowdy
pack from Tight Cove. They were presently
curious. It was a break in the routine of the
road. The thing concerned them nearly. What
the mischief was the matter? Something was
up! Here was no mere pause for rest. The
man was making no arrangements to move
along. And what now? Amusement gave
place to an alert observation of the course of
the unusual incident.

The dogs came a little closer. It was not an
attitude of menace. They followed Billy Topsail's
least movement with jerks of concern and
starts of surprise; and they reflected       inquiring[43]
amazed. Day's work done? Camp for the
night? Food? What next, anyhow? It was
snowing. Thick weather, this! Thick's bags       this
palpable dusk! No man could see his way
in a gale like this. A man had his limitations
and customs. This man would camp. There
would be food in reward of the day's work.
Was there never to be any food? There must
be food! Now       at last! Oh, sure       why, sure       sure       sure
there'd be something to eat when
the man went into camp!

Mm-m? No? Was the new man going to
starve 'em all to death!

Big Cracker, of this profane, rowdy crew,
sidled to the sled. This was in small advances       a
sly encroachment at a time. His object was
plain to the pack. It was theft. They watched
him in a trance of expectant interest. What
would happen to Cracker? Wait and see!
Follow Cracker? Oh, wait and see, first, what
happened to Cracker. And Cracker sniffed at
the tumbled robes. The pack lifted its noses
and sniffed, too, and opened its eyes wide, and
exchanged opinions, and kept watch, in swift,
scared glances, on Billy Topsail; and came
squirming nearer, as though with some inten[44]tion
altogether remote from the one precisely in
mind.

From this intrusion       appearing to be merely
an impudent investigation       Cracker was driven
off with a quick, light clip of the butt of the walrus
whip on the snout. "Keep the brutes down!
Keep un down       ecod!       an' no trouble would
come of it." And down went Cracker. He
leaped away and bristled, and snarled, and
crawled, whimpering then, to his distance;
whereupon the pack took warning. Confound
the man!       he was too quick with the whip.
Cracker had intended no mischief, had he?

After that the big Cracker curled up and
sulked himself to sleep.

"I 'low we're close t' Ginger Head," said
Billy Topsail.

"Ah, no, b'y."

"I seed the nose o' the Scotchman's Breakfast
a while back."

"We're t' the south o' that by three mile."

"We isn't."

"We is."

"Ah, well, anyhow we'll stop the night where
we is. The snow blinds a man."

"That's grievous," Teddy Brisk complained.[45]
"I wisht we was over the barricades an' safe
ashore. The bay's all rotten. My mother
says              "

"You isn't timid, is you?"

"Me? No. My mother says              "

"Ah, you is a bit timid, Teddy."

"Who? Me? I is not. But my mother says
the wind would just              "

"Just a wee bit timid!"

"Ah, well, Billy, I isn't never been out overnight
afore. An' my mother says if the wind
blows a gale from the west, south or sou'west              "

"Never you mind about that, Skipper Teddy.
We've something better t' think about than the
way the wind blows. The wind's full o' notions.
I've no patience t' keep my humour waitin' on
what she does. Now you listen t' me: I got
bread, an' I got 'lasses, an' I got tea, an' I got a
kettle. I got birch all split t' hand, t' save the
weight of an axe on the komatik; an' I got birch
rind, an' I got matches. 'Twill be a scoff"       feast       "Skipper
Teddy. Mm-m! Ecod! My
belly's in a clamour o' greed. The only thing
I isn't got is dog meat. Save for that, Skipper
Teddy, we're complete."

[46]

Teddy Brisk renewed his complaint.

"I wisht," said he, "the wind would switch t'
sea. Once on a time my grand              "

"Never you mind about that."

"Once on a time my grandfather was cotched
by the snow in a gale o' wind off              "

"Ah, you watch how clever I is at makin'
a fire on the ice! Never you mind about
the will o' the wind. 'Tis a foolish habit t' fall
into."

Billy Topsail made the fire. The dogs squatted
in the offing. Every eye was on the operation.
It was interesting, of course. Nothing escaped
notice. Attention was keen and inclusive. It
would flare high       a thrill ran through the wide-mouthed,
staring circle       and expire in disappointment.
Interesting, to be sure: yet going
into camp on the ice was nothing out of the way.
The man would spend the night where he was       that
was all. It portended no extraordinary departure
from the customs       no opportunity. And
the man was alert and capable. No; nothing
stimulating in the situation       nothing to be taken
advantage of.

Billy Topsail was laughing. Teddy Brisk
chattered all the while. Neither was in diffi[47]culty.
Nor was either afraid of anything. It
was not an emergency. There was no release
of authority. And when the circumstances of
the affair, at last, had turned out to be usual in
every respect, interest lapsed, as a matter of
course; and the pack, having presently exhausted
the distraction of backbiting, turned in
to sleep, helped to this good conduct by a crack
of the whip.

"Not another word out o' you!" Billy Topsail
scolded. "You'll be fed full the morrow."

Almost at once it fell very dark. The frost
increased; the snow turned to dry powder and
the wind jumped to half a gale, veering to the
sou'west. Teddy Brisk, with the bread and tea
and molasses stowed away where bread and tea
and molasses best serve such little lads as he, was
propped against the komatik, wrapped up in his
dogskin robes as snug as you like. The fire was
roaring, and the circle of the night was safe and
light and all revealed, in its flickering blaze and
radiant, warm red glow.

Billy Topsail fed the fire hot; and Billy Topsail
gave Teddy Brisk riddles to rede; and Billy
Topsail piped Teddy Brisk a song or two       such
a familiar song of the coast as this:

[48]


'Way down on Pigeon Pond Island,
When daddy comes home from swilein'
Maggoty fish hung up in the air,
Fried in maggoty butter;
Cakes an' tea for breakfast,
Pork an' duff for dinner,
Cakes an' tea for supper       
'Way down on Pigeon Pond Island,
When daddy comes home from swilein'.[1]


Whatever was bitter and inimical in the wind
and dark and driving mist of snow was chased
out of mind by the warm fire and companionable
behaviour.

It was comfortable on the ice: it was a picnic       a
bright adventure; and Teddy Brisk was as
cozy and dry and content as              

"I likes it, Billy," said he. "I jus' fair loves
it here!"

"You does, b'y? I'm proud o' you!"

"'Way out here on the ice. Mm-m! Yes,
sirree! I'm havin' a wonderful happy time,
Billy."

"I'm glad o' that now!"

"An' I feels safe              "

"Aye, b'y!"

"An' I'm's warm              "

"Sure, you is!"
[49]
"An' I'm's sleepy              "

"You go t' sleep, lad."

"My mother says, if the wind              "

"Never you mind about that. I'll take care
o' you       never fear!"

"You would, in a tight place, wouldn't you,
Billy, b'y?"

"Well, I 'low I would!"

"Yes, sirree! You'd take care o' me!"

"You go t' sleep, lad, an' show yourself an old
hand at stoppin' out overnight."

"Aye, Billy; but my mother says              "

"Never you mind about that."

"Ah, well, my mother              "

And Teddy Brisk fell asleep.

CHAPTER V



In Which the Wind Goes to Work, the Ice Behaves
in an Alarming Way, Billy Topsail
Regrets, for Obvious Reasons, Having to Do
with the Dogs, that He Had Not Brought an
Axe, and Teddy Brisk Protests that His
Mother Knew Precisely What She was Talking
About


Well, now, Teddy Brisk fell asleep,
and presently, too, Billy Topsail, in
his wolfskin bag, got the better of his
anxious watch on the wind and toppled off.
The dogs were already asleep, each covered
with a slow-fashioning blanket of snow       ten
round mounds, with neither snout nor hair to
show. The fire failed: it was dark; and the
wind blew up       and higher. A bleak place, this,
on Schooner Bay, somewhere between the
Thimble and the Scotchman's Breakfast of
Ginger Head; yet there was no hardship in the
night       no shivering, blue agony of cold, but full
measure of healthful comfort. The dogs were
warm in their coverings of snow and Billy Top[51]sail
was warm in his wolfskin bag; and Teddy
Brisk, in his dogskin robes, was in a flush and
soft sweat of sound sleep, as in his cot in the cottage
by Jack-in-the-Box, at Tight Cove.

It was a gale of wind by this time. The wind
came running down the bay from Rattle Brook;
and it tore persistently at the ice, urging it out.
It was a matter of twenty miles from the
Thimble, across Schooner Bay, to the Scotchman's
Breakfast of Ginger Head, and a matter of
thirty miles inland to Rattle Brook       wherefrom
you may compute the area of the triangle for
yourself and bestir your own imagination, if you
can, to apply the pressure of a forty-mile gale to
the vast rough surface of the bay.

Past midnight the ice yielded to the irresistible
urge of the wind.

Crack! The noise of the break zigzagged in
the distance and approached, and shot past near
by, and rumbled away like a crash of brittle
thunder. Billy Topsail started awake. There
was a crackling confusion       in the dark, all
roundabout, near and far       like the crumpling
of an infinitely gigantic sheet of crisp paper:
and then nothing but the sweep and whimper
of the wind       those familiar, unportentous sounds,[52]
in their mild monotony, like dead silence in contrast
with the first splitting roar of the break-up.

Billy Topsail got out of his wolfskin bag.
The dogs were up; they were terrified       growling
and bristling; and they fawned close to
Billy, as dogs will to a master in a crisis of
ghostly fear. Billy drove them off; he whipped
them into the dark. The ice had broken from
the cliffs and was split in fields and fragments.
It would move out and go abroad with the high
southwest wind. That was bad enough, yet not,
perhaps, a mortal predicament       the wind would
not run out from the southwest forever; and an
escape ashore from a stranded floe would be no
new thing in the experience of the coast. To be
marooned on a pan of ice, however, with ten
famishing dogs of unsavoury reputation, and for
God only knew how long       it taxed a man's
courage to contemplate the inevitable adventure!

A man could not corner and kill a dog at a
time; a man could not even catch a dog       not
on a roomy pan of ice, with spaces for retreat.
Nor could a man escape from a dog if he could
not escape from the pan; nor could a man endure,
in strength and wakefulness, as long as a
dog. Billy Topsail saw himself attempt the[53]
death of one of the pack       the pursuit of
Cracker, for example, with a club torn from
the komatik. Cracker would easily keep his
distance and paw the ice, head down, eyes
alert and burning; and Cracker would withdraw
and dart out of reach, and swerve away.
And Smoke and Tucker and Scrap, and the
rest of the pack, would all the while be creeping
close behind, on the lookout for a fair opportunity.

No; a man could not corner and kill a dog at
a time. A man could not beat a wolf in the
open; and these dogs, which roamed the timber
and sprang from it, would maneuver like wolves       a
patient waiting for some lapse from caution
or the ultimate moment of weakness; and then
an overwhelming rush. Billy Topsail knew the
dogs of his own coast. He knew his own dogs;
all he did not know about his own dogs was that
Cracker had been concerned in a dubious affair
on the ice off the Tall Old Man. These dogs
had gone on short rations for a month. When
the worst came to the worst       the pan at sea       they
would attack.

Teddy Brisk, too, was wide awake. A thin
little plaint broke in on Billy Topsail's reflections.

[54]

"Is you there, Billy?"

"Aye, I'm here. You lie still, Teddy."

"What's the matter with the dogs, Billy?"

"They're jus' a bit restless. Never you mind
about the dogs. I'll manage the dogs."

"You didn't fetch your axe, did you, Billy?"

"Well, no, Skipper Teddy       no; I didn't."

"That's what I thought. Is the ice broke
loose?"

"Ah, now, Teddy, never you mind about the
ice."

"Is she broke loose?"

"Ah, well       maybe she have broke loose."

"She'll move t' sea in this wind, won't she?"

"Never you mind              "

"Won't she?"

"Ah, well, she may take a bit of a cruise t'
sea."

Teddy Brisk said nothing to this. An interval
of silence fell. And then Teddy plaintively
again:

"My mother said              "

Billy Topsail's rebuke was gentle:

"You isn't goin' t' cry for your mother, is
you?"

"Oh, I isn't goin' t' cry for my mother!"

[55]

"Ah, no! You isn't. No growed man
would."

"All I want t' say," said Teddy Brisk in a
saucy flash of pride, "is that my mother was
right!"



[56]




CHAPTER VI



In Which the Sudden Death of Cracker is Contemplated
as a Thing to Be Desired, Billy
Topsail's Whip Disappears, a Mutiny is Declared
and the Dogs Howl in the Darkness


Past twelve o'clock and the night as black
as a wolf's throat, with the wind blowing
a forty-mile gale, thick and stifling with
snow, and the ice broken up in ragged pans of
varying, secret area       it was no time for any
man to stir abroad from the safe place he occupied.
There were patches of open water
forming near by, and lanes of open water
widening and shifting with the drift and spreading
of the ice; and somewhere between the
cliffs and the moving pack, which had broken
away from them, there was a long pitfall of
water in the dark. The error of putting the
dogs in the traces and attempting to win the
shore in a forlorn dash did not even present
itself to Billy Topsail's experienced wisdom.
Billy Topsail would wait for dawn, to be sure
of his path and direction; and meantime       there[57]
being no occasion for action       he got back into
his wolfskin bag and settled himself for sleep.

It was not hard to go to sleep. Peril of this
sort was familiar to Billy Topsail       precarious
situations, with life at stake, created by wind,
ice, reefs, fog and the sea. There on the ice
the situation was completely disclosed and beyond
control. Nothing was to be manipulated.
Nothing threatened, at any rate, for the moment.
Consequently Billy Topsail was not afraid. Had
he discovered himself all at once alone in a city;
had he been required to confront a garter snake       he
had never clapped eyes on a snake              



Placidly reflecting on the factors of danger to
be dealt with subsequently, Billy Topsail caught
ear, he thought, of a sob and whimper from the
midst of Teddy Brisk's dogskin robes. This was
the little fellow's first full-fledged adventure.
He had been in scrapes before       the little dangers
of the harbour and the adjacent rocks and
waters and wilderness; gusts of wind; the lap
of the sea; the confusion of the near-by back
country, and the like of that; but he had never
been cast away like the grown men of Tight
Cove. And these passages, heroic as they are,[58]
and stimulating as they may be to the ambition
of the little fellows who listen o' winter nights,
are drear and terrifying when first encountered.

Teddy Brisk was doubtless wanting his mother.
Perhaps he sobbed. Yet he had concealed his
fear and homesickness from Billy Topsail; and
that was stoicism enough for any lad of his
years       even a lad of the Labrador. Billy Topsail
offered him no comfort. It would have
shamed the boy to comfort him openly. Once
ashore again Teddy Brisk would want to boast,
like his elders, and to spin his yarn:

"Well now, lads, there we was, ecod! 'way
out there on the ice, me 'n' Billy Topsail; an'
the wind was blowin' a gale from the sou'west,
an' the snow was flyin' as thick as ever you seed
the snow fly, an' the ice was goin' out t' sea on
the jump. An' I says t' Billy: 'I'm goin' t'
sleep, Billy       an' be blowed t' what comes of it!'
An' so I falled asleep as snug an' warm; an'
then              "

Billy Topsail ignored the sob and whimper
from the depths of the dogskin robes.

"The lad haves t' be hardened," he reflected.



Dawn was windy. It was still snowing       a[59]
frosty mist of snow. Billy Topsail put the dogs
in the traces and stowed Teddy Brisk away in
the komatik. The dogs were uneasy. Something
out of the way? What the mischief was
the matter? They came unwillingly. It seemed
they must be sensing a predicament. Billy Topsail
whipped them to their work and presently
they bent well enough to the task.

Snow fell all that day. There were glimpses
of Ginger Head. In a rift of the gale Teddy
Brisk caught sight of the knob of the Scotchman's
Breakfast.

Always, however, the way ashore was barred
by open water. When Billy Topsail caught
sight of the Scotchman's Breakfast for the last
time it was in the southwest. This implied that
the floe had got beyond the heads of the bay
and was moving into the waste reaches of the
open sea. At dusk Billy had circled the pan
twice       hoping for chance contact with another
pan, to the east, and another, and still another;
and thus a path to shore. It was a big pan       a
square mile or more as yet. When the pinch
came, if the pinch should come, Billy thought,
the dogs would not be hampered for room.

Why not kill the dogs? No; not yet. They[60]
were another man's dogs. In the morning, if
the wind held offshore              

Wind and snow would fail. There would be
no harsher weather. Billy Topsail made a little
fire with his last billets of birchwood. He boiled
the kettle and spread a thick slice of bread with
a meager discoloration of molasses for Teddy
Brisk. What chiefly interested Teddy Brisk was
the attitude of the dogs. It was not obedient.
There was swagger in it. A crack of the whip
sent them leaping away, to be sure; but they
intruded again at once       and mutinously persisted
in the intrusion.

Teddy Brisk put out a diffident hand towards
Smoke. Smoke was an obsequious brute.
Ashore he would have been disgustingly grateful
for the caress. Now he would not accept it
at all. He snarled and sprang away. It was
a defiant breach of discipline. What was the
matter with the dogs? They had gone saucy
all at once. The devil was in the dogs. Nor
would they lie down; they withdrew, at last, in
a pack, their hunger discouraged, and wandered
restlessly in the failing light near by.

Teddy Brisk could not account for this singular
behaviour.

[61]

It alarmed him.

"Ah, well," said Billy Topsail, "they're all
savage with hunger."

"Could you manage with nine, Billy?"

Billy Topsail laughed.

"With ease, my son," said he, "an' glad
of it!"

"Is you strong enough t' kill a dog?"

"I'll find that out, Teddy, when the time
comes."

"I was 'lowin' that one dog would feed the
others an' keep un mild till we gets ashore."

"I've that selfsame thing in mind."

Teddy said eagerly:

"Kill Cracker, Billy!"

"Cracker! Already? 'Twould be sheer
murder."

"Aye, kill un now, Billy       ah, kill un right
away now, won't you, b'y? That dog haves a
grudge on me. He've been watchin' me all day
long."

"Ah, no! Hush now, Teddy!"

"I knows that dog, Billy!"

"Ah, now! The wind'll change afore long.
We'll drift ashore       maybe in the mornin'. An
then              "

[62]

"He've his eye on me, Billy!"

Billy Topsail rose.

"You see my whip anywhere?"

"She's lyin' for'ard o' the komatik."

"She's not."

"She was."

"She've gone, b'y!"

"Ecod! Billy, Cracker haves her!"

It was not yet dark. Cracker was sitting
close. It was an attitude of jovial expectation.
He was on his haunches       head on one side and
tail flapping the snow; and he had the walrus
whip in his mouth. Apparently he was in the
mood to pursue a playful exploit. When Billy
Topsail approached he retreated       a little; and
when Billy Topsail rushed he dodged, with ease
and increasing delight. When Billy Topsail
whistled him up and patted to him, and called
"Hyuh! Hyuh!" and flattered him with "Good
ol' dog!" he yielded nothing more than a deepened
attention to the mischievous pleasure in
hand.

Always he was beyond reach       just beyond
reach. It was tantalizing.

Billy Topsail lost his temper. This was a
blunder. It encouraged the dog. To recover[63]
the whip was an imperative precaution; but
Billy could not accomplish it in a temper.
Cracker was willful and agile and determined;
and when he had tired       it seemed       of his taunting
game, he whisked away, with the pack in
chase, and was lost to sight in the gale. It fell
dark then; and presently, far away a dog
howled, and there was an answering howl, and
a chorus of howls. They were gone for good.
It was a mutiny. Billy knew that his authority
had departed with the symbol of it.

He did not see the whip again.



[64]




CHAPTER VII



In Which a Blazing Club Plays a Salutary Part,
Teddy Brisk Declares the Ways of His Mother,
and Billy Topsail Looks Forward to a Battle
that No Man Could Win


Next night       a starlit time then, and the
wind gone flat       Billy Topsail was
burning the fragments of the komatik.
All day the dogs had roamed the pan. They
had not ventured near Billy Topsail's authority       not
within reach of Billy's treacherously minded
flattery and coaxing. In the exercise of this
new freedom they had run wild and fought
among themselves like a mutinous pirate crew.
Now, however, with night down, they had crept
out of its seclusion and were sitting on the edge
of the firelight, staring, silent, pondering.

Teddy Brisk was tied up in the wolfskin bag.
It was the best refuge for the lad. In the event
of a rush he would not be torn in the scuffle; and
should the dogs overcome Billy Topsail       which
was not yet probable       the little boy would be
none the worse off in the bag.

[65]

Had the dogs been a pack of wolves Billy
would have been in livid fear of them; but these
beasts were dogs of his own harbour, which he
had commanded at will and beaten at will, and
he was awaiting the onset with grim satisfaction.
In the end, as he knew, the dogs would have an
advantage that could not be resisted; but now       Billy
Topsail would "l'arn 'em! Let 'em come!"

Billy's club, torn from the komatik, was lying
one end in his little fire. He nursed it with care.

Cracker fawned up. In the shadows, behind,
the pack stared attentive. It was a pretense at
playfulness       Cracker's advance. Cracker pawed
the ice, and wagged his tail, and laughed. This
amused Billy. It was transparent cunning.
Billy gripped his club and let the fire freely ignite
the end of it. He was as keen as the dog       as sly
and as alert.

He said:

"Good ol' dog!"

Obviously the man was not suspicious.
Cracker's confidence increased. He moved
quickly, then, within leaping distance. For a
flash he paused, king-hairs rising. When he
rushed, the pack failed him. It started, quivered,
stopped, and cautiously stood still. Billy[66]
was up. The lift of Cracker's crest and the
dog's taut pause had amply warned him.

A moment later Cracker was in scared, yelping
flight from the pain and horror of Billy's
blazing club, and the pack was in ravenous chase
of him. Billy Topsail listened for the issue of
the chase. It came presently       the confusion of
a dog fight; and it was soon over. Cracker was
either dead or master again. Billy hoped the
pack had made an end of him and would be content.
He could not be sure of the outcome.
Cracker was a difficult beast.

Released from the wolfskin bag and heartened
by Billy's laughter, Teddy Brisk demanded:

"Was it Cracker?"

"It was."

Teddy grinned.

"Did you fetch un a fatal wallop?"

"I left the dogs t' finish the job. Hark!
They're not feastin', is they? Mm-m? I don't
know."

They snuggled up to the little fire. Teddy
Brisk was wistful. He talked now       as often before       of
the coming of a skiff from Our Harbour.
He had a child's intimate knowledge of his own
mother       and a child's wise and abounding faith.

[67]

"I knows my mother's ways," he declared.
"Mark me, Billy, my mother's an anxious
woman an' wonderful fond o' me. When my
mother heard that sou'west wind blow up, 'Skipper
Thomas,' says she t' my grandfather, 'them
b'ys is goin' out with the ice; an' you get right
straight up out o' bed an' tend t' things.'

"An' my grandfather's a man; an' he says:

"'Go to, woman! They're ashore on Ginger
Head long ago!'

"An' my mother says:

"'Ah, well, they mightn't be, you dunder-head!'       for
she've a wonderful temper when
she's afeared for my safety.

"An' my grandfather says:

"'They is, though.'

"An' my mother says:

"'You'll be off in the bait skiff t'-morrow,
sir, with a flea in your ear, t' find out at Our
Harbour.'

"An' she'd give that man his tea in a mug
(scolding) until he got a Tight Cove crew
t'gether an' put out across the bay. Ecod! but
they'd fly across the bay in a gale o' wind like
that! Eh, Billy?"

"All in a smother       eh, Teddy?"

[68]

"Yep       all in a smother. My grandfather's fit
an' able for anything in a boat. An' they'd send
the news up an' down the coast from Our Harbour       wouldn't
they, Billy?"

"'Way up an' down the coast, Teddy."

"Yep       'way up an' down. They must be
skiffs from Walk Harbour an' Skeleton Cove an'
Come-Again Bight searchin' this floe for we       eh,
Billy?"

"An' Our Harbour too."

"Yep       an' Our Harbour too. Jus' the way
they done when ol' Bad-Weather West was cast
away       eh, Billy? Don't you 'low so?"

"Jus' that clever way, Teddy."

"I reckon my mother'll tend t' that." Teddy's
heart failed him then. "Anyhow, Billy," said he
weakly, "you'll take care o' me       won't you       if
the worst comes t' the worst?"

The boy was not too young for a vision of the
worst coming to the worst.

"None better!" Billy replied.

"I been thinkin' I isn't very much of a man,
Billy. I've not much courage left."

"Huh!" Billy scoffed. "When we gets
ashore, an' I tells my tale o' these days              "

Teddy started.

[69]

"Billy," said he, "you'll not tell what I said?"

"What was that now?"

"Jus' now, Billy       about              "

"I heard no boast. An I was you, Teddy, I
wouldn't boast too much. I'd cling t' modesty."

"I takes it back," said Teddy. He sighed.
"An' I'll stand by."

It did not appear to Billy Topsail how this
guardianship of the boy was to be accomplished.
Being prolonged, it was a battle, of course, no
man could win. The dogs were beaten off for
the time. They would return       not that night,
perhaps, or in the broad light of the next day;
but in the dark of the night to come they would
return, and, failing success then, in the dark of
the night after.

That was the way of it.



[70]




CHAPTER VIII



In Which Teddy Brisk Escapes From the Wolfskin
Bag and Determines to Use His Crutch
and Billy Topsail Comes to the Conclusion that
"It Looks Bad"


Next day the dogs hung close. They
were now almost desperately ravenous.
It was agony for them to be so near
the satisfaction of their hunger and in inhibitive
terror of seizing it. Their mouths dripped.
They were in torture       they whimpered and ran
restless circles; but they did not dare. They
would attack when the quarry was weak or unaware.
Occasionally Billy Topsail sallied on
them with his club and a loud, intimidating
tongue, to disclose his strength and teach them
discretion; and the dogs were impressed and
restrained by this show. If Billy Topsail could
catch and kill a dog he would throw the carcass
to the pack and thus stave off attack. Having
been fed, the dogs would be in a mild humour.
Billy might then entice and kill another       for
himself and Teddy Brisk.



THE DOGS WERE DESPERATELY RAVENOUS


[71]

Cracker was alive and still masterful. Billy
went out in chase of Smoke. It was futile.
Billy cut a ridiculous figure in the pursuit. He
could neither catch the dog nor overreach him
with blandishments; and a cry of alarm from
the boy brought him back to his base in haste to
drive off Cracker and Tucker and Sling, who
were up to the wolf's trick of flanking. The
dogs had reverted. They were wolves again       as
nearly as harbour dogs may be. Billy perceived
that they could no longer be dealt with as
the bond dogs of Tight Cove.

In the afternoon Billy slept. He would need
to keep watch through the night.

Billy Topsail had husbanded the fragments of
the komatik. A fire burned all that night       a
mere glow and flicker of light. It was the last
of the wood. All that remained was the man's
club and the boy's crutch. Now, too, the last
of the food went. There was nothing to eat.
What Billy had brought, the abundant provision
of a picnic, with something for emergencies       the
bread and tea and molasses       had been conserved,
to be sure, and even attenuated. There
was neither a crumb nor a drop of it left.

What confronted Billy Topsail now, however,[72]
and alarmed his hope and courage, was neither
wind nor frost, nor so much the inevitable pangs
of starvation, which were not immediate, as a
swift abatement of his strength. A starved man
cannot long continue at bay with a club. Billy
could beat off the dogs that night perhaps       after
all, they were the dogs of Tight Cove, Cracker
and Smoke and Tucker and Sling; but to-morrow
night       he would not be so strong to-morrow
night.

The dogs did not attack that night. Billy
heard them close       the sniffing and whining and
restless movement in the dark that lay beyond
the light of his feeble fire and was accentuated
by it. But that was all.



It was now clear weather and the dark of the
moon. The day was bright and warm. When
night fell again it was starlight       every star of
them all twinkling its measure of pale light
to the floe. The dogs were plain as shifting,
shadowy creatures against the white field of ice.
Billy Topsail fought twice that night. This was
between midnight and dawn. There was no
maneuvering. The dogs gathered openly, viciously,
and delivered a direct attack. Billy[73]
beat them off. He was gasping and discouraged,
though, at the end of the encounter. They
would surely come again       and they did. They
waited       an hour, it may have been; and then
they came.

There was a division of the pack. Six dogs       Spunk
and Biscuit and Hero in advance       rushed
Billy Topsail. It was a reluctant assault. Billy
disposed of the six       after all, they were dogs of
Tight Cove, not wolves from the rigours of the
timber; and Billy was then attracted to the rescue
of Teddy Brisk, who was tied up in the wolfskin
bag, by the boy's muffled screams. Cracker
and Smoke and Tucker and Sling were worrying
the wolfskin bag and dragging it off. They
dropped it and took flight when Billy came roaring
at them with a club.

When Billy released him from the wolfskin
bag the boy was still screaming. He was not
quieted       his cries and sobbing       until the day
was broad.

"Gimme my crutch!" said he. "I'll never
go in that bag no more!"

"Might as well wield your crutch," Billy
agreed.

To survive another night was out of the ques[74]tion.
Another night came in due course, however,
and was to be faced.



It was a gray day. Sky and ice and fields of
ruffled water had no warmth of colour. All the
world was both cold and drear. A breeze was
stirring down from the north and would be bitter
in the dusk. It cut and disheartened the castaways.
It portended, moreover, a black night.

Teddy cried a good deal that day       a little
whimper, with tears. He was cold and hungry       the
first agony of starvation       and frightened
and homesick. Billy fancied that his spirit was
broken. As for Billy himself, he watched the
dogs, which watched him patiently near by       a
hopeless vigil for the man, for the dogs were
fast approaching a pass of need in which hunger
would dominate the fear of a man with a club.
And Billy was acutely aware of this much       that
nothing but the habitual fear of a man with a
club had hitherto restrained the full fury and
strength of the pack.

That fury, breaking with determination, would
be irresistible. No man could beat off the attack
of ten dogs that were not, in the beginning, already
defeated and overcome by awe of him.[75]
In the dark       in the dark of that night Billy
could easily be dragged down; and the dogs
were manifestly waiting for the dark to fall.

It was to be the end.

"It looks bad       it do so, indeed!" Billy Topsail
thought.

That was the full extent of his admission.



[76]




CHAPTER IX



In Which Attack is Threatened and Billy Topsail
Strips Stark Naked in the Wind in Pursuit
of a Desperate Expedient and with Small
Chance of Success


Teddy Brisk kept watch for a skiff
from Our Harbour or Come-Again
Bight. He depended for the inspiration
of this rescue on his mother's anxious love
and sagacity. She would leave nothing to the
indifferent dealings and cold issue of chance; it
was never "more by good luck than good conduct"
with her, ecod!

"I knows my mother's ways!" he sobbed, and
he repeated this many times as the gray day
drew on and began to fail. "I tells you, Billy,
I knows my mother's ways!"

And they were not yet beyond sight of the
coast. Scotchman's Breakfast of Ginger Head
was a wee white peak against the drab of the
sky in the southwest; and the ragged line of
cliffs running south and east was a long, thin[77]
ridge on the horizon where the cottages of Walk
Harbour and Our Harbour were.

No sail fluttered between       a sail might be
confused with the colour of the ice, however, or
not yet risen into view; but by and by, when
the misty white circle of the sun was dropping
low, the boy gave up hope, without yielding
altogether to despair. There would be no skiff
along that day, said he; but there would surely
be a sail to-morrow, never fear       Skipper Thomas
and a Tight Cove crew.

In the light airs the floe had spread. There
was more open water than there had been.
Fragments of ice had broken from the first
vast pans into which Schooner Bay ice had
been split in the break-up. These lesser, lighter
pans moved faster than the greater ones; and
the wind from the north       blown up to a steady
breeze by this time       was driving them slowly
south against the windward edge of the more
sluggish fields in that direction.

At sunset       the west was white and frosty       a
small pan caught Billy Topsail's eye and instantly
absorbed his attention. It had broken
from the field on which they were marooned
and was under way on a diagonal across a quiet[78]
lane of black water, towards a second great field
lying fifty fathoms or somewhat less to the south.

Were Billy Topsail and the boy aboard that
pan the wind would ferry them away from the
horrible menace of the dogs. It was a small
pan       an area of about four hundred square
feet; yet it would serve. It was not more than
fifteen fathoms distant. Billy could swim that
far       he was pretty sure he could swim that far,
the endeavour being unencumbered; but the
boy       a little fellow and a cripple       could not
swim at all.

Billy jumped up.

"We've got t' leave this pan," said he, "an'
forthwith too."

"Have you a notion, b'y?"

Billy laid off his seal-hide overjacket. He
gathered up the dogs' traces       long strips of
seal leather by means of which the dogs had
drawn the komatik, a strip to a dog; and he
began to knot them together       talking fast the
while to distract the boy from the incident of
peculiar peril in the plan.

The little pan in the lane       said he       would be
a clever ferry. He would swim out and crawl
aboard. It would be no trick at all. He would[79]
carry one end of the seal-leather line. Teddy
Brisk would retain the other. Billy pointed out
a ridge of ice against which Teddy Brisk could
brace his sound leg. They would pull, then       each
against the other; and presently the little
pan would approach and lie alongside the big
pan       there was none too much wind for that       and
they would board the little pan and push
off, and drift away with the wind, and leave
the dogs to make the best of a bad job.

It would be a slow affair, though       hauling in
a pan like that; the light was failing too       flickering
out like a candle end       and there must be
courage and haste       or failure.

Teddy Brisk at once discovered the interval
of danger to himself.

"I'll be left alone with the dogs!" he objected.

"Sure, b'y," Billy coaxed; "but then you
see              "

"I won't stay alone!" the boy sobbed. He
shrank from the direction of the dogs towards
Billy. At once the dogs attended. "I'm
afeared t' stay alone!" he screamed. "No,
no!"

"An we don't leave this pan," Billy scolded,
"we'll be gobbled up in the night."

[80]

That was not the immediate danger. What
confronted the boy was an immediate attack,
which he must deal with alone.

"No! No! No!" the boy persisted.

"Ah, come now              "

"That Cracker knows I'm a cripple, Billy.
He'll turn at me. I can't keep un off."

Billy changed front.

"Who's skipper here?" he demanded.

"You is, sir."

"Is you takin' orders or isn't you?"

The effect of this was immediate. The boy
stopped his clamour.

"I is, sir," said he.

"Then stand by!"

"Aye, sir!"       a sob and a sigh.



It was to be bitter cold work in the wind and
water. Billy Topsail completed his preparations
before he began to strip. He lashed the end of
the seal-leather line round the boy's waist and
put the club in his hand.

All this while he gave directions: The boy
was to face the dogs; he was not to turn round
for hints of Billy's progress or to be concerned
at all with that; he was not to lose courage; he[81]
was to feint and scold; he was to let no shadow
of fear cross his face       no tremor of fear must
touch his voice; he was not to yield an inch; he
was not to sob and cover his eyes with his hands       in
short, he was to mind his own task of keeping
the dogs away and leave Billy to accomplish
his.

And the boy answered: "Yes, sir!" and
"Aye, sir!" and "Very well, sir!"       like an old
hand of the coast.

It was stimulating. Billy Topsail was heartened.
He determined privately that he would
not turn to look back       that if the worst came to
the worst, and he could manage to do so, he
would jerk the lad into the water and let him
drown. The snarling tumult of the onset would
warn him when the worst had come to the worst.

And then he stripped stark naked, quickly
stowed away his clothes in the midst of the
boy's dogskin robes, tied the end of the seal-leather
line round his waist, and ran to the edge
of the pan.

"If you drowns       " the boy began.

"Keep them dogs off!" Billy Topsail roared.
"I'll not drown!"

He slipped into the water and struck out.



[82]




CHAPTER X



In Which Teddy Brisk Confronts the Pack Alone
and Cracker Leads the Assault


By this time the sun was touching the cliffs
of shore. It was a patch of struggling
white light in the drear gray colour of
the west. It would drop fast. In his punt, in
summer weather, wondering all the while at the
acceleration of this last descent, Teddy Brisk had
often paused to watch the sun fall and flicker out
of sight. It had seemed to fall beyond the rim
of the world, like a ball.

"She tumbles through the last foot or two!"
he had determined.

In a little while the sun would be gone. Now
the sky was overcast and scowling. In the east
it was already dusk. The cloudy black sky in
the east caught no light from the feeble sun.
Presently everywhere it would be dark. It had
turned colder too. The wind from the north
was still blowing up       a nipping gray wind
which would sweep the floe and hamper the[83]
manipulation of the little pan towards which the
naked Billy Topsail was striving.

And the wind lifted the dry snow and drove it
past Teddy Brisk's feet in swirling wreaths. The
floe was smoking, the boy thought. Before long
the snow would rise higher and envelop him.
And he thought that when Billy reached the
little pan, and stood exposed and dripping in
the blast, he would be very cold. It would take
a long time, too, to haul the little pan across the
lane of water.

It will be recalled that Teddy Brisk was ten
years old. He stood alone. He knew the
temper of the dogs. Billy Topsail was out of
reach. The burden of fear had fallen on the
boy       not on Billy. The boy had been in a
panic; yet he was not now even afraid. Duty
occupied him. He had no time for reflection.
The hazard of the quarter of an hour to come,
however, was clear to him. Should he fail to
keep off the dogs through every moment of that
time, he would be torn to death before Billy
could return to his rescue.

Should Billy Topsail fail to reach the pan       should
Billy go down midway       he would surely
be devoured.

[84]

And Billy Topsail was no swimmer to boast
of. Teddy knew that. He had heard Billy tell
of it. Billy could keep afloat       could achieve a
slow, splashing progress.

That was true. Billy's chance of winning the
pan was small. But Teddy was Labrador born
and bred. What now commanded his fear was
Billy's orders to duty. Obedience to a skipper
was laid on all men. It must be instant and unfailing
in an emergency. Billy was in command.
He was responsible. It was for the boy
to obey. That was the teaching of his habitat.

Consequently Teddy Brisk's terror yielded and
he stood fast.

When Billy began to strip, the dogs were disturbed.
What was the man up to? What was
this? Queer proceeding this! It was a trick.
When he stood naked in the wind the dogs were
uneasy. When he went into the water they
were alarmed. They withdrew. Cracker and
Smoke ran to the water's edge and stared at
Billy       keeping half an eye on the boy meantime.
It troubles a dog to see a man in the
water. Smoke whined. Cracker growled and
crouched to leap after Billy. He could easily
overtake and drown Billy.

[85]

Teddy went at Cracker and Smoke with his
club.

He screamed at them:

"Back, you, Cracker! Back, you, Smoke!"

The dogs responded to this furious authority.
They scurried away and rejoined the others.
Teddy taunted them. He laughed at the pack,
challenged it       crutch under his left arm and club
swinging in his right hand. He taunted the
dogs by name       Cracker and Smoke and Tucker.
This bewildered the dogs. They were infinitely
suspicious. The boy hobbled at them in a rage,
a few feet forth       the seal-leather line round his
waist limited him       and defied them. They retreated.

When Teddy returned to the edge of the field
they sat regarding him in amazement and renewed
suspicion. In this way for a time the boy
kept the dogs at a distance       by exciting their
surprise and suspicion. It sufficed for a space.
The dogs were curious. They were entertained.
What was strange in the behaviour of the quarry,
moreover, was fearsome to the dogs. It indicated
unknown resources. The dogs waited.

Presently Teddy could devise no new startling
gestures. He was never silent       he was never[86]
still; but his fantastic antics, growing familiar
and proving innocuous, began to fail of effect.
Something else       something out of the way and
unexpected       must be done to distract and employ
the attention of the dogs. They were aware
of Billy Topsail's absence       they were cunning
cowards and they would take advantage of the
opportunity.

The dogs began to move       to whine and circle
and toss their heads. Teddy could see the concerted
purpose take form. It was as though they
were conspiring together. He was fully aware
of what impended. They were coming! he
thought; and they were coming in a moment.
It was an attack agreed on. They were to act
as a pack.

They advanced. It was tentative and slow.
They paused.

They came closer. Teddy brandished his club
and reviled them in shrill screams. The dogs
paused again. They crouched then. Cracker
was in the lead. The boy hated Cracker. Cracker's
white breast was touching the ice.

His head was thrust forward. His crest began
to rise.



[87]




CHAPTER XI



In Which Teddy Brisk Gives the Strains of a
Tight Cove Ballad to the North Wind, Billy
Topsail Wins the Reward of Daring, Cracker
Finds Himself in the Way of the Evil-Doer,
and Teddy Brisk's Boast Makes Doctor Luke
Laugh


Stripped down, at first, on the field, Billy
Topsail would not yield to the cold. He
did not shrink from the wind. He moved
like a man all clothed. Nor would he yield to
the shock of the water. He ignored it. It was
heroic self-command. But he was the man
for that       a Newfoundlander. He struck out
precisely as though he had gone into the
summer water of Ruddy Cove. If he relapsed
from this attitude the cold would strike through
him. A chill would momentarily paralyze his
strength.

He was neither a strong nor a cunning
swimmer. In this lapse he would go down and
be choked beyond further effort before he could
recover the use of his arms and legs. It was icy
cold. He would not think of the cold. His best[88]
protection against it was the sufficient will to
ignore it. The power would not long endure.
It must endure until he had clambered out of the
water to the little pan towards which he floundered.
He was slow in the water. It seemed
to him that his progress was mysteriously prolonged       that
the wind was driving the pan
away.

The wind could not rise to this pitch in a
minute; but when he was midway of the lane he
thought half an hour had elapsed       an hour       that
he must have left the field and the boy far behind.

The boy was not much more than fifteen yards
away.

A word of advice occurred to Billy. He did
not turn. He was then within a dozen strokes of
the little pan.

He shouted:

"Give un a tune!"

Teddy Brisk dropped his crutch, fumbled in
his waistcoat pocket, whipped out his mouth
organ, clapped it to his lips, and blew a lively
air:


Lukie's boat was painted green,
The finest boat that ever was seen;
Lukie's boat had cotton sails,
A juniper rudder and galvanized nails.

[89]
And he so profoundly astonished the dogs
with these sudden, harmonious sounds, accompanied
by the jerky movement of a crippled
leg, designed to resemble a dance, and in itself
shockingly suspicious       so profoundly astonished
the dogs that they paused to reconsider the
matter in hand.

It was startling. They sat up. Aha! What
was this? What did it portend?

And the little boy wheezed away:


Lukie sailed her out one day,
A fine spell o' weather in the month o' May;
She leaked so bad when he put about,
He drove her ashore on the Tailor's Snout.


And he kept on blowing that famous jig-time
ballad of Tight Cove for dear life until a tug at
the line round his waist warned him to brace
himself against the steady pull to follow.

Teddy was still giving the strains of Lukie's
adventure to the north wind when the little pan
came alongside.

"Carry on!" Billy Topsail chattered behind
him.

Teddy interrupted himself to answer:

"Aye, sir!"

[90]

"I'll get my clothes an' the skins aboard.
Ecod! It's awful cold!"

Presently they pushed out from the field. It
had not taken long. The patch of white light
that was the sun had not yet dropped out of
sight behind the cliffs of the shore.



It was a bad night on the field to the south.
The boys were hungry. It was cold. Billy
Topsail suffered from the cold. In the morning
the northerly wind had turned the heap of dogskin
robes into a snowdrift. The sun shone.
Billy was still cold. He shivered and chattered.
He despaired. Rescue came, however, in the
afternoon. It was the Tight Cove skiff, hailing
now from Our Harbour, with Doctor Luke
aboard.

The skiff from Come-Again Bight found the
dogs. The dogs were wild       the men said       and
would not come aboard, but ran off in a pack
to the farthest limits of the field and were not
seen again       save only Cracker, who fawned and
jumped into the skiff without so much as a by-your-leave.
And Cracker, in due course and
according to custom, they hanged by the neck
at Tight Cove until he was dead.

[91]

That day, however       the afternoon of the
rescue       when the Tight Cove skiff came near,
Teddy Brisk put his hands to his mouth and
shouted       none too lustily:

"Ahoy!"

"Aye?" Skipper Thomas answered.

"Did my mother send you?"

"She did."

Teddy Brisk turned to Billy Topsail.

"Didn't I tell you," he sobbed, his eyes blazing,
"that I knowed my mother's ways?"

And Doctor Luke laughed.



[92]




CHAPTER XII



In Which Billy Topsail's Agreeable Qualities
Win a Warm Welcome with Doctor Luke at
Our Harbour, There is an Explosion at
Ragged Run, Tommy West Drops Through
the Ice and Vanishes, and Doctor Luke is in a
Way Never to Be Warned of the Desperate
Need of His Services


In Doctor Luke's little hospital at Our Harbour,
Billy Topsail fell in with a charming
group       Doctor Luke and his friends; and
being himself a boy of a good many attractive
qualities, and of natural good manners, which
association with his friend Archie Armstrong, of
St. John's, Sir Archibald's son, had helped to
fashion       being a manly, good-mannered, humorous
fellow, he was very soon warmly accepted.
There was no mystery about Doctor Luke. He
was an Englishman       a well-bred, cultured man;
and having been wrecked on the coast, and having
perceived the great need of a physician in
those parts, he had thrown in his lot for good
and all with the Labrador folk. And he was[93]
obviously happy       both busy and happy. That
he regretted his determination was a preposterous
thing to assume; on the contrary, he positively
did not regret it       he whistled and sang
and laughed and laboured, and Billy Topsail
was convinced that he was not only the most
useful man in the world, but the most delightful
and best, and the happiest, too.

That Doctor Luke was useful was very soon
evident to an astonishing degree. Teddy Brisk's
leg was scraped       it was eventually healed and
became quite as sound as Billy Topsail's "off
shank." But there was a period of convalescence,
during which Billy Topsail had all the
opportunity in the world to observe just how
mightily useful Doctor Luke was. The demands
upon him were extraordinary; and his
response to them       his ready, cheerful, skillful,
brave response       was more extraordinary still.

Winter was not yet done with: summer delayed       there
was more snow, more frost; and
the ice drifted in and out with the variable
winds: so that travelling in those parts was
at its most dangerous period. Yet Doctor Luke
went about with small regard for what might
happen       afoot, with the dogs, and in a punt,[94]
when the ice, having temporarily drifted away,
left open water. Up and down the coast, near
and far, always on the wing: that was Doctor
Luke       the busiest, happiest, most useful man
Billy Topsail had ever known.

And Billy Topsail was profoundly affected
by all this beneficent activity. He wished to
emulate it. This was a secret, to be sure; there
was no reason for Billy Topsail to think that a
fisherman's son like himself would ever be presented
with the opportunity to "wield a knife"
and be made master of the arts of healing       and
consequently he said nothing about the growing
ambition. But the ambition flourished.

When Doctor Luke returned from his professional
calls with tales of illness cured and
distress alleviated, and when Billy Topsail reflected
that there would have been neither cure
nor alleviation had it not been for Doctor Luke's
skill and kindly heart, Billy Topsail wanted with
all his strength to be about that selfsame business.
And there was a good deal in the performance
of it to appeal to a lad like Billy Topsail       the
adventure of the thing: for Doctor
Luke seldom counted the chances, when they
seemed not too unreasonably against him, and[95]
when the need was urgent he did not count
them at all.

Billy Topsail was just a little bit puzzled at
first. Why should Doctor Luke do these
things? There was no gain       no material gain
worth considering; but it did not take Billy
Topsail long to perceive that there was in fact
great gain       far exceeding material gain: the
satisfaction in doing a good deed for what
Doctor Luke called "the love of God" and
nothing else whatsoever. Doctor Luke was not
attached to any Mission. His work was his
own: his field was his own       nobody contributed
to his activities; nobody helped him in
any way. Yet his work was done in the spirit
of the missionary; and that was what Billy Topsail
liked about it       the masterful, generous, high-minded
quality of it.

Being an honest, healthy lad, Billy Topsail
set Doctor Luke in the hero's seat and began
to worship, as no good boy could very well
help doing; it was not long, indeed, before
Doctor Luke had grown to be as great a hero
as Sir Archibald Armstrong, Archie's father       and
that is saying a good deal. In the lap of
the future there lay some adventures in which[96]
Billy Topsail and Archie Armstrong were to
be concerned; but Billy Topsail was not aware
of that.

Billy Topsail was neither a prophet nor the
son of a prophet. Sometimes, however, he
sighed:

"I wish Archie was here!"

And that wish was to come true.



Before Teddy Brisk was well enough to be
sent home, something happened at Ragged Run
Cove, which lay across Anxious Bight, near by
the hospital at Our Harbour; and Doctor Luke
and Billy Topsail were at once drawn into the
consequences of the accident. It was March
weather. There was sunshine and thaw. Anxious
Bight was caught over with rotten ice
from Ragged Run Cove to the heads of Our
Harbour. A rumour of seals       a herd on the
Arctic drift-ice offshore       had come in from the
Spotted Horses. It inspired instant haste in
all the cottages of Ragged Run       an eager,
stumbling haste.

In Bad-Weather Tom West's wife's kitchen,
somewhat after ten o'clock in the morning, in
the midst of this hilarious scramble to be off to[97]
the floe, there was a flash and spit of fire, pale
in the sunshine, and the clap of an explosion
and the clatter of a sealing gun on the bare
floor; and in the breathless, dead little interval,
enduring between the appalling detonation and
a man's groan of dismay and a woman's choke
and scream of terror       in this shocked silence,
Dolly West, Bad-Weather Tom's small maid,
and Joe West's niece, stood swaying, wreathed
in gray smoke, her little hands pressed tight to
her eyes.

She was a pretty little creature       she had been
a pretty little creature: there had been yellow
curls, in the Labrador way       and rosy cheeks
and grave blue eyes; but now of all this shy,
fair loveliness              

"You've killed her!"

"Dear Lord       no!" cried Uncle Joe West,
whose gun had exploded.

Dolly dropped her hands. She reached out,
then, for something to grasp.

And she plainted:

"I ithn't dead, mother. I juth'       I juth' can't
thee."

She extended her red hands.

"They're all wet!" she complained.

[98]

By this time the mother had the little girl
gathered close in her arms.

She moaned:

"Doctor Luke       quick!"

Tommy West caught up his cap and mittens
and sprang to the door.

"Not by the Bight!" Joe West shouted.

"No, sir."

Dolly West whimpered:

"It thmart-th, mother!"

"By Mad Harry an' Thank-the-Lord!"

"Ay, sir."

Dolly screamed       now:

"It hurt-th! Oh, oh, it hurt-th!"

"An' haste, lad!"

"Ay, sir."

There was of course no doctor at Ragged
Run; there was a doctor, Doctor Luke, at
Our Harbour, however       across Anxious Bight.
Tommy West avoided the rotten ice of the
Bight, which he dared not cross, and took the
'longshore trail by way of Mad Harry and
Thank-the-Lord. At noon he was past Mad
Harry, his little legs wearing well and his breath
coming easily through his expanded nostrils       he
had not paused; and at four o'clock       still on a[99]
dog-trot       he had hauled down the chimney
smoke of Thank-the-Lord and was bearing up
for Our Harbour. Early dusk caught him short-cutting
the doubtful ice of Thank-the-Lord Cove;
and half an hour later, midway of the passage to
Our Harbour, with two miles left to accomplish       dusk
falling thick and cold, then, and a frosty
wind blowing       the heads of Our Harbour looming
black and solid in the wintry night beyond       he
dropped through the ice and vanished.
There was not a sign of him left       some bubbles,
perhaps: nothing more.



[100]




CHAPTER XIII



In Which Doctor Luke Undertakes a Feat of
Daring and Endurance and Billy Topsail
Thinks Himself the Luckiest Lad in the
World


Returning from a call at Tumble
Tickle, in clean, sunlit weather, with
nothing more tedious than eighteen
miles of wilderness trail and rough floe ice behind
him, Doctor Luke was chagrined to discover
himself a bit fagged. He had come
heartily down the trail from Tumble Tickle in
the early hours of that fine, windy morning, fit
and eager for the trudge       as a matter of course;
but on the ice, in the shank of the day       there
had been eleven miles of the floe       he had lagged.
A man cannot practice medicine out of a Labrador
outport harbour and not know what it
means to stomach a physical exhaustion. Doctor
Luke had been tired before. He was not disturbed
by that. But being human, he looked
forward to rest; and in the drear, frosty dusk,
when he rounded the heads of Home, opened[101]
the lights of Our Harbour, and caught the warm,
yellow gleam of the lamp in the surgery window,
he was glad to be near his supper and his bed.

And so he told Billy Topsail, whom he found
in the surgery, replenishing the fire.

"Ha, Billy!" said he. "I'm glad to be home."

Afterwards, when supper had been disposed of,
and Doctor Luke was with Billy in the surgery,
the rest of the family being elsewhere occupied,
there was a tap on the surgery door. Doctor
Luke called: "Come in!"       with some wonder
as to the event. It was no night to be abroad
on the ice. Yet the tap on the surgery door could
mean but one thing       somebody was in trouble;
and as he called "Come in!" and while he
waited for the door to open, Doctor Luke considered
the night and wondered what strength
he had left.

A youngster       he had been dripping wet and
was now sparkling all over with frost and ice in
the light of the surgery lamp       intruded.

"Thank-the-Lord Cove?"

"No, sir."

"Mad Harry?"

"Ragged Run, sir."

"Bad-Weather West's lad?"

[102]

"Yes, sir."

"Been in the water?"

The boy grinned. He was ashamed of himself.
"Yes, sir. I falled through the ice, sir."

"Come across the Bight?"

The boy stared. "No, sir. A cat couldn't
cross the Bight the night, sir. 'Tis all rotten. I
come alongshore by Mad Harry an' Thank-the-Lord.
I dropped through all of a sudden, sir, in
Thank-the Lord Cove."

"Who's sick?"

"Uncle Joe's gun went off, sir."

Doctor Luke rose. "Uncle Joe's gun went
off! Who was in the way?"

"Dolly, sir."

"And Dolly in the way! And Dolly              "

"She've gone blind, sir. An' her cheek, sir       an'
one ear, sir              "

"What's the night?"

"Blowin' up, sir. There's a scud. An' the
moon              "

"You didn't cross the Bight? Why not?"

"'Tis rotten from shore t' shore. I'd not try
the Bight, sir, the night."

"No?"

"No, sir." The boy was very grave.

[103]

"Mm-m."

All this while Doctor Luke had been moving
about the surgery in sure haste       packing a
waterproof case with little instruments and vials
and what-not. And now he got quickly into his
boots and jacket, pulled down his coonskin cap,
pulled up his sealskin gloves, handed Bad-Weather
West's boy over to the family for supper
and bed, and was about to close the surgery
door upon himself when Billy Topsail interrupted
him.

"I say, sir!"

Doctor Luke halted.

"Well, Billy?"

"Take me, sir! Won't you?"

"What for?"

"I wants t' go."

"I go the short way, Billy."

"Sure, you does! I knows you, sir!"

Doctor Luke laughed.

"Come on!" said he.

Billy Topsail thought himself the luckiest lad
in the world. And perhaps he was.



[104]




CHAPTER XIV



In Which Billy Topsail and Doctor Luke Take to
the Ice in the Night and Doctor Luke Tells
Billy Topsail Something Interesting About
Skinflint Sam and Bad-Weather Tom West
of Ragged Run


Doctor Luke and Billy Topsail took
to the harbour ice and drove head down
into the gale. There were ten miles to
go. It was to be a night's work. They settled
themselves doggedly to the miles. It was a mile
and a half to the Head, where the Tickle led a
narrow way from the shelter of Our Harbour to
Anxious Bight and the open sea; and from the
lee of the Head       a straightaway across Anxious
Bight       it was nine miles to Blow-me-Down
Dick of Ragged Run Cove. Doctor Luke had
rested but three hours. It was but a taste. Legs
and feet were bitterly unwilling to forego a sufficient
rest. They complained of the interruption.
They were stiff and sore and sullen. It was
hard to warm them to their labour. Impatient
to revive the accustomed comfort and glow of
strength, Doctor Luke began to run.

[105]

Presently they slowed up. Doctor Luke told
Billy Topsail, as they pushed on, something
about the Ragged Run family they were to visit.
"There is a small trader at Ragged Run," said
he. "A strange mixture of conscience and greed
he is. Skinflint Sam       they call him. Conscience?
Oh, yes, he has a conscience! And
his conscience       as he calls it       has made him
rich as riches go in these parts. No, of course
not! You wouldn't expect a north-coast trader
to have a conscience; and you wouldn't expect a
north-coast trader with a conscience to be rich!"

Billy Topsail agreed with this.

"Ah, well," Doctor Luke went on, "conscience
is much like the wind. It blows every which
way (as they say); and if a man does but trim
his sails to suit, he can bowl along in any direction
without much wear and tear of the spirit.
Skinflint Sam bowled along, paddle-punt fisherman
to Ragged Run merchant. Skinflint went
where he was bound for, wing-and-wing to the
breeze behind, and got there with his peace of
mind showing never a sign of the weather. It is
said that the old man has an easy conscience and
ten thousand dollars!

"This Bad-Weather West vowed long ago[106]
that he would even scores with Skinflint Sam
before he could pass to his last harbour with any
satisfaction.

"'With me, Tom?' said Sam. 'That's a saucy
notion for a hook-an'-line man.'

"'Ten more years o' life,' said Tom, 'an' I'll
square scores.'

"'Afore you evens scores with me, Tom,' said
Sam, 'you'll have t' have what I wants.'

"'I may have it.'

"'An' also,' said Sam, 'what I can't get.'

"'There's times,' said Tom, 'when a man
stands in sore need o' what he never thought
he'd want.'

"'When you haves what I needs,' said Sam,
'I'll pay what you asks.'

"'If 'tis for sale,' said Tom.

"'Money talks,' said Sam.

"'Ah, well,' said Tom, 'maybe it don't speak
my language.'

"Of course, Skinflint Sam's conscience is just
as busy as any other man's conscience. I think
it troubles Sam. It doesn't trouble him to be
honest, perhaps; it troubles him only to be rich.
And possibly it gives him no rest. When trade is
dull       no fish coming into Sam's storehouses and[107]
no goods going out of Sam's shop       Sam's conscience
makes him grumble and groan. They say
a man never was so tortured by conscience before.

"And to ease his conscience Sam goes over
his ledgers by night; and he will jot down a gallon
of molasses here, and a pound of tea there,
until he has made a good day's trade of a bad
one. 'Tis simple enough, too: for Sam gives out
no accounts, but just strikes his balances to please
his greed, at the end of the season, and tells his
dealers how much they owe him or how little he
owes them."

Doctor Luke paused.

"Ay," said Billy Topsail. "I've seed that
way o' doin' business."

"We all have, Billy," said Doctor Luke. And
resumed: "In dull times Sam's conscience irks
him into overhauling his ledgers. 'Tis otherwise
in seasons of plenty. But Sam's conscience apparently
keeps pricking away just the same       aggravating
Sam into getting richer and richer.
There is no rest for Skinflint Sam. Skinflint
Sam must have all the money he can take by
hook and crook or suffer the tortures of an evil
conscience. And as any other man, Sam must
ease that conscience or lose sleep o' nights.

[108]

"And so in seasons of plenty up goes the
price of tea at Skinflint Sam's shop. And up
goes the price of pork. And up goes the price
of flour. All sky high, ecod! Never was such
harsh times (says Sam); why, my dear man, up
St. John's way (says he) you couldn't touch tea
nor pork nor flour with a ten-foot sealing-gaff.
And no telling what the world is coming to, with
prices soaring like a gull in a gale and all the
St. John's merchants chary of credit!

"''Tis awful times for us poor traders,' says
Sam. 'No tellin' who'll weather this here panic.
I'd not be surprised if we got a war out of it.'

"Well, now, as you know, Billy, on the north-coast
in these days it isn't much like the big
world beyond. Folk don't cruise about. They
are too busy. And they are not used to it anyhow.
Ragged Run folk are not born at Ragged
Run, raised at Rickity Tickle, married at Seldom-Come-By,
aged at Skeleton Harbour and
buried at Run-By-Guess. They are born and
buried at Ragged Run. So what the fathers
think at Ragged Run, the sons think; and what
the sons know, has been known by the old men
for a good many years.

"Nobody is used to changes. They are shy[109]
of changes. New ways are fearsome. And so
the price of flour is a mystery. It is, anyhow.
Why it should go up and down at Ragged Run
is beyond any man of Ragged Run to fathom.
When Skinflint Sam says that the price of flour
is up       well, then, it is up; and that's all there is
about it. Nobody knows better. And Skinflint
Sam has the flour. You know all about that
sort of thing, don't you, Billy?"

"Ay, sir," Billy replied. "But I been helpin'
the clerk of an honest trader."

"There are honest traders. Of course! Not
Sam, though. And, as I was saying, Sam has
the pork, as well as the flour. And he has the
sweetness and the tea. And he has the shoes
and the clothes and the patent medicines. And
he has the twine and the salt. And he has almost
all the cash there is at Ragged Run. And
he has the schooner that brings in the supplies
and carries away the fish to the St. John's
markets.

"He is the only trader at Ragged Run. His
storehouses and shop are jammed with the
things that the folk of Ragged Run can't do
without and are able to get nowhere else. So
all in all, Skinflint Sam can make trouble for the[110]
folk that make trouble for him. And the folk
grumble. But it is all they have the courage
to do. And Skinflint Sam lets them grumble
away. The best cure for grumbling (says he)
is to give it free course. If a man can speak
out in meeting (says he) he will work no mischief
in secret.

"'Sea-lawyers, eh?' says Sam. 'Huh! What
you fellers want, anyhow? Huh? You got
everything now that any man could expect.
Isn't you housed? Isn't you fed? Isn't you
clothed? Isn't you got a parson and a schoolmaster?
I believes you wants a doctor settled
in the harbour! A doctor! An' 'tisn't two
years since I got you your schoolmaster!
Queer times we're havin' in the outports these
days with every harbour on the coast wantin' a
doctor within hail.

"'You're well enough done by at Ragged
Run. None better nowhere. An' why? Does
you ever think o' that? Why? Because I got
my trade here. An' think o' me! If ar a one
o' you had my brain-labour t' do, you'd soon
find out what harsh labour was like. What with
bad debts, an' roguery, an' failed seasons, an'
creditors t' St. John's, I'm hard put to it t' keep[111]
my seven senses. An' small thanks I gets       me
that keeps this harbour alive in famine an'
plenty. 'Tis the business I haves that keeps
you. You make trouble for my business, an'
you'll come t' starvation! Now, you mark
me!'

"I do not want you to think too harshly of
Skinflint Sam. No doubt he has his good
points. Most of us can discover a good point
or two in ourselves and almost everybody else.
There are times when Skinflint Sam will yield
an inch. Oh, yes! I've known Skinflint Sam
to drop the price of stick-candy when he had
put the price of flour too high for anybody's
comfort."



[112]




CHAPTER XV



In Which Bad-Weather Tom West's Curious
Financial Predicament is Explained


"Well, now," said Doctor Luke, continuing
his tale, "Bad-Weather
Tom West, of Ragged Run, has a
conscience, too. But 'tis just a common conscience.
Most men have that kind. It is not
like Skinflint Sam's conscience. Nothing 'useful'
ever comes of it. It is like yours and mine,
Billy. It troubles Tom West to be honest and it
keeps him poor. All Tom West's conscience
ever aggravates him to do"       Doctor Luke was
speaking in gentle irony now       "is just to live
along in a religious sort of fashion, and rear his
family, and be decently stowed away in the
graveyard when his time is up if the sea doesn't
catch him first.

"But 'tis a busy conscience for all that       and
as sharp as a fish-prong. There is no rest
for Tom West if he doesn't fatten his wife and
crew of little lads and maids. There is no peace
of mind for Tom if he doesn't labour! And so[113]
Tom labours, and labours, and labours. Dawn
to dusk, in season, his punt is on the grounds off
Lack-a-Day Head, taking fish from the sea to be
salted and dried and passed into Skinflint Sam's
storehouses.

"The tale began long ago, Billy. When
Tom West was about fourteen years old, his
father died. 'Twas of a Sunday afternoon, Tom
says, that they stowed him away. He remembers
the time: spring weather and a fair day,
with the sun low, and the birds twittering in the
alders just before turning in.

"Skinflint Sam caught up with young Tom
on the road home from the little graveyard on
Sunset Hill.

"'Well, lad,' said he, 'the old skipper's gone.'

"'Ay, sir, he's dead an' buried.'

"'A fine man,' said Skinflint. 'None finer.'

"With that young Tom broke out crying.
'He were a kind father t' we,' says he. 'An'
now he's dead!'

"'You lacked nothin' in your father's life-time,'
said Sam.

"'An' now he's dead!'

"'Well, well, you've no call t' be afeared o'
goin' hungry on that account,' said Sam, putting[114]
an arm over the lad's shoulder. 'No; nor none
o' the little crew over t' your house. Take up
the fishin' where your father left it off, lad,' said
he, 'an' you'll find small difference. I'll cross
out your father's name on the books an' put
down your own in its stead.'"

Billy Topsail interrupted.

"That was kind!" he snorted, in anger.
"What a kind man this Skinflint is!"

And Doctor Luke continued:

"'I'm fair obliged,' said Tom. 'That's kind,
sir.'

"'Nothin' like kindness t' ease sorrow,' said
Skinflint Sam. 'Your father died in debt, lad.'

"'Ay, sir?'

"'Deep.'

"'How much, sir?'

"'I'm not able t' tell offhand,' said Sam.
''Twas deep enough. But never you care.
You'll be able t' square it in course o' time.
You're young an' hearty. An' I'll not be harsh.
I'm no skinflint!'

"'That's kind, sir.'

"'You       you       will square it?'

"'I don't know, sir.'

"'What?' cried Sam. 'What! You're not[115]
knowin', eh? That's saucy talk. Didn't you
have them there supplies?'

"'I 'low, sir.'

"'An' you guzzled your share, I'll be bound!'

"'Yes, sir.'

"'An' your mother had her share?'

"'Yes, sir.'

"'An' you're not knowin' whether you'll pay
or not! Ecod! What is you? A scoundrel?
A dead beat? A rascal? A thief? A jail-bird?'

"'No, sir.'

"''Tis for the likes o' you that jails was
made.'

"'Oh, no, sir!'

"'Doesn't you go t' church? Is that what
they learns you there? I'm thinkin' the parson
doesn't earn what I pays un. Isn't you got no
conscience?'

"'Twas just a little too much for young Tom.
You see, Tom West had a conscience       a conscience
as fresh and as young as his years. And
Tom had loved his father well. And Tom
honoured his father's name. And so when he
had brooded over Skinflint Sam's words for a
time       and when he had lain awake in the night[116]
thinking of his father's goodness       he went over
to Skinflint's office and said that he would pay
his father's debt.

"Skinflint gave him a clap on the back.

"'You are an honest lad, Tom West!' said
he. 'I knowed you was. I'm proud t' have
your name on my books!'

"And after that Tom kept hacking away on
his father's debt.

"In good years Skinflint would say:

"'She's comin' down, Tom. I'll just apply
the surplus.'

"And in bad he'd say:

"'You isn't quite cotched up with your own
self this season, b'y. A little less pork this season,
Tom, an' you'll square this here little balance
afore next. I wisht this whole harbour was as
honest as you. No trouble, then,' said he, 't'
do business in a businesslike way.'

"When Tom got over the hill       fifty and more       his
father's debt, with interest, according to
Skinflint's figures, which Tom had no learning
to dispute, was more than it ever had been; and
his own was as much as he ever could hope to
pay. And by that time Skinflint Sam was rich
and Bad-Weather Tom was gone sour. One of[117]
these days       and not long, now       I shall make it
my business to settle with Skinflint Sam. And I
should have done so before, had I known of it."

"When did you find out, sir?"

"Bad-Weather Tom," Doctor Luke replied,
"came to consult me about two months ago. He
is in a bad way. I       well, I had to tell him so.
And then he told me what I have told you       all
about Skinflint Sam and his dealings with him.
It was an old story, Billy. I have       well, attended
to such matters before, in my own poor way.
Bad-Weather Tom did not want me to take this
up. 'You leave it to me,' said he; 'an' I'll fix
it meself.' I wish he might be able to 'fix' it to
his satisfaction."

"I hopes he does!" said Billy.

"Well, well," Doctor Luke replied, "it is Bad-Weather
Tom's maid who is in need of us at
Ragged Run."

Billy liked that "Us"!



[118]




CHAPTER XVI



In Which Doctor Luke and Billy Topsail Proceed
to Accomplish What a Cat Would Never Attempt
and Doctor Luke Looks for a Broken
Back Whilst Billy Topsail Shouts, "Can You
Make It?" and Hears No Answer


When they came to the Head and there
paused to survey Anxious Bight in a
flash of the moon Billy Topsail and
Doctor Luke were tingling and warm and limber
and eager. Yet they were dismayed by the prospect.
No man could cross from the Head to
Blow-me-Down Dick of Ragged Run Cove in
the dark. Doctor Luke considered the light.
Communicating masses of ragged cloud were
driving low across Anxious Bight. Offshore
there was a sluggish bank of black cloud. And
Doctor Luke was afraid of that bank of black
cloud. The moon was risen and full. It was
obscured. The intervals of light were less than
the intervals of shadow. Sometimes a wide,
impenetrable cloud, its edges alight, darkened
the moon altogether. Still       there was light[119]
enough. All that was definitely ominous was
the bank of black cloud lying sluggishly offshore.

"I don't like that cloud, Billy," said Doctor
Luke.

"No, sir; no more does I."

"It will cover the moon by and by."

"Sure, sir."

"There may be snow in it."

"Sure t' be, sir."

The longer Doctor Luke contemplated that
bank of black cloud       its potentiality for catastrophe       the
more he feared it.

"If we were to be overtaken by snow              "

Billy interrupted with a chuckle.

"'Twould be a tidy little fix," said he. "Eh,
sir?"

"Well, if that's all you have to say," said Doctor
Luke       and he laughed       "come right along!"

It was blowing high. There was the bite and
shiver of frost in the wind. Half a gale ran in
from the open sea. Midway of Anxious Bight
it would be a saucy, hampering, stinging head-wind.
And beyond the Head the ice was in
doubtful condition. A man might conjecture:
that was all. What was it Tommy West had[120]
said? "A cat couldn't cross!" It was mid-spring.
Freezing weather had of late alternated
with periods of thaw and rain. There had been
windy days. Anxious Bight had even once been
clear of ice. A westerly wind had broken the
ice and swept it out beyond the heads; a punt
had fluttered over from Ragged Run Cove.

In a gale from the northeast, however, these
fragments had returned with accumulations of
Arctic pans and hummocks from the Labrador
Current; and a frosty night had caught them
together and sealed them to the cliffs of the
coast. It was a slender attachment       a most
delicate attachment: one pan to the other and
the whole to the rocks.

It had yielded somewhat       it must have gone
rotten       in the weather of that day.

What the frost had accomplished since dusk
could be determined only upon trial.

"Soft as cheese!" Doctor Luke concluded.

"Rubber ice," said Billy.

"Air-holes," said the Doctor.

There was another way to Ragged Run       the
way by which Tommy West had come. It
skirted the shore of Anxious Bight       Mad Harry
and Thank-the-Lord and Little Harbour Deep       [121]and
something more than multiplied the distance
by one and a half. Doctor Luke was
completely aware of the difficulties of Anxious
Bight, and so was Billy Topsail       the way from
Our Harbour to Ragged Run: the treacherous
reaches of young ice, bending under the weight
of a man, and the veiled black water, and the
labour, the crevices, the snow-crust of the Arctic
pans and hummocks, and the broken field and
wash of the sea beyond the lesser island of the
Spotted Horses.

They knew, too, the issue of the disappearance
of the moon       the desperate plight into which the
sluggish bank of black cloud might plunge a
man.

Yet they now moved out and shaped a course
for the black bulk of the Spotted Horses.

This was in the direction of Blow-me-Down
Dick of Ragged Run and the open sea.

"Come on!" said Doctor Luke.

"I'm comin', sir," Billy replied.

There was something between a chuckle and
a laugh from Billy's direction.

Doctor Luke started.

"Laughing, Billy?" he inquired.

"I jus' can't help it, sir."

[122]

"Nothing much to laugh at."

"No, sir," Billy replied. "I don't feel like
laughin', sir. But 'tis so wonderful dangerous
out on the Bight that I jus' can't help laughin'."



Doctor Luke and Billy Topsail were used to
travelling all sorts of ice in all sorts of weather.
The returning fragments of the ice of Anxious
Bight had been close packed for two miles beyond
the entrance to Our Harbour by the northeast
gale that had driven them back from the
open. An alien would have stumbled helplessly
and exhausted himself; by and by he would
have begun to crawl       in the end he would have
lost his life in the frost. This was rough ice.
In the press of the wind the drifting floe had
buckled. It had been a big gale. Under the
whip of it, the ice had come down with a rush.
And when it encountered the coast, the first
great pans had been thrust out of the sea by the
weight of the floe behind.

A slow pressure had even driven them up the
cliffs of the Head and heaped them in a tumble
below.

It was thus a folded, crumpled floe       a vast
field of broken bergs and pans at angles.

[123]

No Newfoundlander would adventure on the
ice without a gaff. A gaff is a lithe, iron-shod
pole, eight or ten feet in length. Doctor Luke
was as cunning and sure with the gaff as any
old hand of the sealing fleet; and Billy Topsail
always maintained that he had been born with a
little gaff in his hand instead of a silver spoon in
his mouth. They employed the gaffs now to advantage.
They used them like vaulting poles.
They walked less than they leaped. But this
was no work for the half-light of an obscured
moon. Sometimes they halted for light. And
delay annoyed Doctor Luke. A peppery humour
began to possess him. A pause of ten
minutes       they squatted for rest meantime       threw
him into a state of incautious irritability.
At this rate it would be past dawn before they
made the cottages of Ragged Run Cove.

It would be slow beyond       surely slow on the
treacherous reaches of green ice between the
floe and the Spotted Horses.

And beyond the Spotted Horses, whence the
path to Ragged Run led       the crossing of Tickle-my-Ribs!

A proverb of Our Harbour maintains that a
fool and his life are soon parted.

[124]

Doctor Luke invented the saying.

"'Twould be engraved on my stationery," he
would declare, out of temper with recklessness,
"if I had any engraved stationery!"

Yet now, impatient of precaution, when he
thought of Dolly West, Doctor Luke presently
chanced a leap. It was error. As the meager
light disclosed the path, a chasm of fifteen feet
intervened between the edge of the upturned
pan upon which he and Billy Topsail stood and
a flat-topped hummock of Arctic ice to which he
was bound. There was footing for the tip of his
gaff midway below. He felt for this footing to
entertain himself whilst the moon delayed.

It was there. He was tempted. It was an
encouragement to rash conduct. The chasm
was critically deep for the length of the gaff.
Worse than that, the hummock was higher than
the pan. Doctor Luke peered across. It was
not much higher. Was it too high? No. It
would merely be necessary to lift stoutly at the
climax of the leap. And there was need of haste       a
little maid in hard case at Ragged Run and
a rising cloud threatening black weather.

"Ah, sir, don't leap it!" Billy pleaded.

"Tut!" scoffed the Doctor.

[125]

"Wait for the moon, sir!"

A slow cloud covered the moon. It was aggravating.
How long must a man wait? A
man must take a chance       what? And all at
once Doctor Luke gave way to impatience. He
gripped his gaff with angry determination and
projected himself towards the hummock of
Arctic ice. In mid-air he was doubtful. A flash
later he had regretted the hazard. It seemed he
would come short of the hummock altogether.
He would fall. There would be broken bones.
He perceived now that he had misjudged the
height of the hummock.

Had the gaff been a foot longer Doctor Luke
would have cleared the chasm. It occurred to
him that he would break his back and merit the
fate of his callow mistake. Then his toes caught
the edge of the flat-topped hummock. His
boots were of soft seal-leather. He gripped the
ice. And now he hung suspended and inert.
The slender gaff bent under the prolonged strain
of his weight and shook in response to the shiver
of his arms.

Billy Topsail shouted:

"Can you make it, sir?"

There was no answer.



[126]




CHAPTER XVII



In Which Rubber Ice is Encountered and Billy
Topsail is Asked a Pointed Question


Dolly West's mother, with Dolly in
her arms, resting against her soft, ample
bosom, sat by the kitchen fire. It was
long after dark. The wind was up       the cottage
shook in the squalls. She had long ago washed
Dolly's eyes and temporarily staunched the terrifying
flow of blood; and now she waited       and
had been waiting, with Dolly in her arms, a long,
long time; rocking gently and sometimes crooning
a plaintive song of the coast to the restless
child.

Uncle Joe West came in.

"Hush!"

"Is she sleepin' still?"

"Off an' on. She've a deal o' pain. She cries
out, poor lamb!"

Dolly stirred and whimpered.

"Any sign of un, Joe?"

"'Tis not time."

"He might              "

[127]

"'Twill be hours afore he comes. I'm jus'
wonderin'              "

"Hush!"

Dolly moaned.

"Ay, Joe?"

"Tommy's but a wee feller. I'm wonderin' if
he              "

The woman was confident. "He'll make it,"
she whispered.

"Ay; but if he's delayed              "

"He was there afore dusk. An' Doctor Luke
got underway across the Bight              "

"He'll not come by the Bight!"

"He'll come by the Bight. I knows that man.
He'll come by the Bight       an' he'll              "

"Pray not!"

"I pray so."

"If he comes by the Bight, he'll never get
here at all. The Bight's breakin' up. There's
rotten ice beyond the Spotted Horses. An'
Tickle-my-Ribs is              "

"He'll come. He'll be here afore              "

"There's a gale o' snow comin' down. 'Twill
cloud the moon. A man would lose hisself              "

"He'll come."

Uncle Joe West went out again. This was[128]
to plod once more down the narrows to the
base of Blow-me-Down Dick and search the
vague light of the coast towards Thank-the-Lord
and Mad Harry for the first sight of Doctor
Luke. It was not time. He knew that. There
would be hours of waiting. It would be dawn
before a man could come by Thank-the-Lord and
Mad Harry if he left Our Harbour even so early
as dusk. And as for crossing the Bight       no
man could cross the Bight. It was blowing up,
too       clouds rising and a threat of snow abroad.
Uncle Joe West glanced apprehensively towards
the northeast. It would snow before dawn. The
moon was doomed. A dark night would fall.

And the Bight       Doctor Luke would never attempt
to cross the Bight              



Doctor Luke, hanging between the hummock
and the pan, the gaff shivering under his weight,
slowly subsided towards the hummock. It was
a slow, cautious approach. He had no faith in
his foothold. A toe slipped. He paused. It
was a grim business. The other foot held. The
leg, too, was equal to the strain. He wriggled
his toe back to its grip of the edge of the ice. It
was an improved foothold. He turned then and[129]
began to lift and thrust himself backward. And
a last thrust on the gaff set him on his haunches
on the Arctic hummock.

He turned to Billy Topsail.

"Thank God!" said he. And then: "Come
on, Billy!"

There was a better light now. Billy Topsail
chose a narrower space to leap. And he leaped
it safely. And they went on; and on       and on!
There was a deal of slippery crawling to do       of
slow, ticklish climbing. Doctor Luke and Billy
Topsail rounded bergs, scaled perilous inclines,
leaped crevices. Sometimes they were bewildered
for a space. When the moon broke
they could glimpse the Spotted Horses from the
highest elevations of the floe. In the depressions
of the floe they could not descry the way at
all.

It was as cold as death now. Was it ten below?
The gale bit like twenty below.

"'Tis twenty below!" Billy Topsail insisted.

Doctor Luke ignored this.

"We're near past the rough ice," said he,
gravely.

"Rubber ice ahead," said Billy.

Neither laughed.

[130]

"Ay," the Doctor observed; and that was all.

When the big northeast wind drove the ice
back into Anxious Bight and heaped it inshore,
the pressure had decreased as the mass of the
floe diminished in the direction of the sea. The
outermost areas had not felt the impact. They
had not folded       had not "raftered." There had
been no convulsion offshore as inshore when the
rocks of Afternoon Coast interrupted the rush.
The pans had come to a standstill and snuggled
close.

When the wind failed they had subsided
towards the open. As they say on the coast,
the ice had "gone abroad." It was distributed.
And after that the sea had fallen flat; and a
vicious frost had caught the floe       wide-spread
now       and frozen it fast. It was six miles from
the edge of the raftered ice to the first island of
the Spotted Horses. The flat pans were solid
enough       safe and easy going; but this new,
connecting ice       the lanes and reaches of it              

Doctor Luke's succinct characterization of the
condition of Anxious Bight was also keen.

These six miles were perilous.

"Soft as cheese!"

All that day the sun had fallen hot on the[131]
young ice in which the scattered pans of the floe
were frozen. Doctor Luke recalled that in the
afternoon he had splashed through an occasional
pool of shallow water on the floe between Tumble
Tickle and the short-cut trail to Our Harbour.
Certainly some of the wider patches of green ice
had been weakened to the breaking point.
Here and there they must have been eaten clear
through. It occurred to Doctor Luke       contemplating
an advance with distaste       that these
holes were like open sores.

And by and by the first brief barrier of new
ice confronted Doctor Luke and Billy Topsail.
They must cross it. A black film       the colour
of water in that light       bridged the way from
one pan to another. Neither Doctor Luke nor
Billy Topsail would touch it. They leaped it
easily. A few fathoms forward a second space
halted them. Must they put foot on it? With
a running start a man could       well, they chose
not to touch the second space, but to leap it.

Soon a third interval interrupted them. No
man could leap it. Doctor Luke cast about for
another way. There was none. He must run
across. A flush of displeasure ran over him.
He scowled. Disinclination increased.

[132]

"Green ice!" said he.

"Let me try it, sir!"

"No."

"Ay, sir! I'm lighter."

"No."

Billy Topsail crossed then like a cat before he
could be stopped       on tiptoe and swiftly; and
he came to the other side with his heart in a
flutter.

"Whew!"

The ice had yielded without breaking. It had
creaked, perhaps       nothing worse. Doctor Luke
crossed the space without accident. It was what
is called "rubber ice." There was more of it       there
were miles of it. As yet the pans were
close together. Always however the intervals
increased. The nearer the open sea the more
wide-spread was the floe. Beyond       hauling
down the Spotted Horses, which lay in the open       the
proportion of new ice would be vastly
greater.

At a trot, for the time, over the pans, which
were flat, and in delicate, mincing little spurts
across the bending ice, Doctor Luke and Billy
Topsail proceeded. In a confidence that was
somewhat flushed       they had rested       Doctor[133]
Luke went forward. And presently, midway of
a lane of green ice, he heard a gurgle, as the ice
bent under his weight. Water washed his boots.
He had been on the lookout for holes. This
hole he heard       the spurt and gurgle of it. He
had not seen it.

"Back!" he shouted, in warning.

Billy ran back.

"All right, sir?"

Safe across, Doctor Luke grinned. It was a
reaction of relief.

"Whew! Whew!" he whistled. "Try below."

Billy crossed below.

"Don't you think, sir," said he, doubtfully,
"that we'd best go back?"

"Do you think so?"

Billy reflected.

"No, sir," said he, flushing.

"Neither do I. Come on."



[134]




CHAPTER XVIII



In Which Discretion Urges Doctor Luke to Lie
Still in a Pool of Water


It was a mean light       this intermittent moonlight:
with the clouds slow and thick, and
the ominous bank of black cloud rising all
the while from the horizon. A man should go
slow in a light like that! But Doctor Luke and
Billy Topsail must make haste. And by and by
they caught ear of the sea breaking under the
wind beyond the Little Spotted Horse. They
were nearing the limits of the ice. In full moonlight
the whitecaps flashed news of a tumultuous
open. A rumble and splash of breakers came
down with the gale from the point of the island.
It indicated that the sea was working in the
passage between the Spotted Horses and Blow-me-Down
Dick of the Ragged Run coast. The
waves would run under the ice       would lift it
and break it. In this way the sea would eat its
way through the passage. It would destroy the
young ice. It would break the pans to pieces
and rub them to slush.

[135]

Doctor Luke and Billy Topsail must make the
Little Spotted Horse and cross the passage between
the island and the Ragged Run coast.

"Come on!" said the Doctor again.

Whatever the issue of haste, they must carry
on and make the best of a bad job. Otherwise
they would come to Tickle-my-Ribs, between the
Little Spotted Horse and Blow-me-Down Dick of
Ragged Run, and be marooned from the mainshore.
And there was another reason. It was
immediate and desperately urgent. As the sea
was biting off the ice in Tickle-my-Ribs so too it
was encroaching upon the body of the ice in
Anxious Bight.

Anxious Bight was breaking up. The scale of
its dissolution was gigantic. Acres of ice were
wrenched from the field at a time and then
broken up by the sea. What was the direction
of this swift melting? It might take any direction.
And a survey of the sky troubled Doctor
Luke no less than Billy Topsail. All this while
the light had diminished. It was failing still. It
was failing faster. There was less of the moon.
By and by it would be wholly obscured.

"If we're delayed," Doctor Luke declared,
"we'll be caught by the dark."

[136]

"Hear that, sir!" Billy exclaimed.

They listened.

"Breaking up fast!" said the Doctor.

Again there was a splitting crash. Another
great fragment of the ice had broken away.

"Come on!" cried Billy, in alarm.

At first prolonged intervals of moonlight had
occurred. Masses of cloud had gone driving
across a pale and faintly starlit sky. A new proportion
was disclosed. Now the stars were
brilliant in occasional patches of deep sky. A
glimpse of the moon was rare. From the northeast
the ominous bank of black cloud had risen
nearly overhead. It would eventually curtain
both stars and moon and make a thick black
night of it.

A man would surely lose his life on the ice in
thick weather       on one or other of the reaches of
new ice. And thereabouts the areas of young ice
were wider. They were also more tender. Thin
ice is a proverb of peril and daring. To tiptoe
across the yielding film of these dimly visible
stretches was instantly and dreadfully dangerous.
It was horrifying. A man took his life in his
hand every time he left a pan.

Doctor Luke was not insensitive. Neither[137]
was Billy Topsail. They began to sweat       not
with labour, but with fear. When the ice bent
under them, they gasped and held their breath.
They were in livid terror of being dropped
through into the sea. They were afraid to proceed       they
dared not stand still; and they came
each time to the solid refuge of a pan with breath
drawn, teeth set, faces contorted, hands clenched       a
shiver in the small of the back. This was
more exhausting than the labour of the folded
floe. Upon every occasion it was like escaping
an abyss.

To achieve safety once, however, was not to
win a final relief       it was merely to confront, in
the same circumstances, a precisely similar peril.
Neither Doctor Luke nor Billy Topsail was
physically exhausted. Every muscle that they
had was warm and alert. Yet they were weak.
A repetition of suspense had unnerved them. A
full hour of this and sometimes they chattered
and shook in a nervous chill.

In the meantime they had approached the rocks
of the Little Spotted Horse.

They rested a moment.

"Now for it, boy!" said the Doctor, then.

"Ay, ay, sir!"

[138]

"Sorry you came, Billy?"

Billy was a truthful boy       and no hero of the
melodrama.

"I wisht we was across, sir," said he.

"So do I," the Doctor agreed. "Come," he
added, heartily; "we'll go across!"

In the lee of the Little Spotted Horse the ice
had gathered as in a back-current. It was close
packed alongshore to the point of the island.
Between this solidly frozen press of pans and the
dissolving field in Anxious Bight there had been
a lane of ruffled open water before the frost fell.
It measured perhaps fifty yards. It was now
black and still       sheeted with new ice which had
been delayed in forming by the ripple of that exposed
situation.

Doctor Luke and Billy Topsail had encountered
nothing as doubtful. They paused on the brink.
A long, thin line of solid pan-ice, ghostly white
in the dusk beyond, was attached to the rocks of
the Little Spotted Horse. It led all the way to
Tickle-my-Ribs. They must make that line of
solid ice. They must cross the wide lane of
black, delicately frozen new ice that lay between
and barred their way. And there was no way out
of it.

[139]

Doctor Luke waited for the moon. When the
light broke       a thin, transient gleam       he started.

"Wait," said he, "until I'm across."

A few fathoms forth the ice began to yield. A
moment later Doctor Luke stopped short and recoiled.
There was a hole       gaping wide and almost
under his feet. He stopped. The water
overflowed and the ice cracked. He must not
stand still. To avoid a second hole he twisted
violently to the right and almost plunged into a
third opening. It seemed the ice was rotten
from shore to shore.

And it was a long way across. Doctor Luke
danced a zigzag towards the pan-ice under
the cliffs       spurting forward and retreating and
swerving. He did not pause. Had he paused
he would have dropped through. When he was
within two fathoms of the pan-ice a foot broke
through and tripped him flat on his face. With
his weight thus distributed he was momentarily
held up. Water squirted and gurgled out of the
break       an inch of water, forming a pool.

Doctor Luke lay still and expectant in this
pool.



[140]




CHAPTER XIX



In Which Doctor Luke and Billy Topsail Hesitate
in Fear on the Brink of Tickle-my-Ribs


Dolly West's mother still sat rocking
by the kitchen fire. It was long
past midnight now. Once more Uncle
Joe West tiptoed in from the frosty night.

"Is she sleepin' still?" he whispered.

"Hush! She've jus' toppled off again. She's
havin' a deal o' pain, Joe. An' she've been
bleedin' again."

"Put her down on the bed, dear."

The woman shook her head. "I'm afeared
'twould start the wounds, Joe. I'm not wantin'
t' start un again. Any sign o' Doctor Luke yet,
Joe?"

"Not yet."

"He'll come soon."

"No; 'tis not near time. 'Twill be dawn
afore he              "

"Soon, Joe."

"He'll be delayed by snow. The moo[141]n's
near gone. 'Twill be black dark in half an
hour. I felt a flake o' snow as I come in. An'
he'll maybe wait at Mad Harry              "

"He's comin' by the Bight, Joe."

Dolly stirred       cried out       awakened with a
start       and lifted her bandaged head a little.

She did not open her eyes.

"Is that you, Doctor Luke, sir?" she plainted.

"Hush!" the mother whispered. "'Tis not
the Doctor yet."

"When              "

"He's comin'."

"I'll take a look," said Joe.

He went out again and stumbled down the
path to Blow-me-Down Dick by Tickle-my-Ribs.



Doctor Luke lay still and expectant in the
pool of water near the pan-ice and rocks of the
Little Spotted Horse. He waited. Nothing
happened. It was encouraging. But he did
not dare stand up. Nor would he dare to get
to his knees and crawl.

There was no help to be had from the agonized
Billy Topsail.

Both knew it.

[142]

"Shall I come, sir?" Billy called.

"Stay where you are," Doctor Luke replied,
"or we'll both drop through. Don't move."

"Ay, sir."

Presently Doctor Luke ventured delicately to
take off a mitten       to extend his hand, to sink
his finger-nails in the ice and attempt to draw
himself forward. He tried again. It was a failure.
His finger-nails were too short. He could
merely scratch the ice. He reflected that if he
did not concentrate his weight       that if he kept
it distributed       he would not break through. And
once more he tried to make use of his finger-nails.

There was no snow on this ice. It was a
smooth, hard surface. It was dry. It turned
out that the nails of the other hand were longer.
Doctor Luke managed to gain half an inch before
they slipped.

They slipped again       and again and again.
It was hopeless. Doctor Luke lay still       pondering.

Billy Topsail's agony of anxiety increased.

"Is you safe, sir?"

"Stay where you are!"

"Ay, sir!"

[143]

Doctor Luke could not continue to lie still.
Presently he would be frozen in the pool of
water. In emergencies he was used to indulging
in a simple philosophical reflection: A man
can lose his life but once. Now he shot his gaff
towards the pan-ice, to be rid of the incumbrance
of it, and lifted himself on his palms and toes.
By this the distribution of his weight was not
greatly disturbed. It was not concentrated upon
one point. It was divided by four and laid upon
four points.

And there were no fearsome consequences.
It was a hopeful experiment. Doctor Luke
stepped by inches on his hands towards the
pan-ice       dragging his toes. In this way he
came to the line of solid ice under the cliffs of
the Little Spotted Horse and gained the refuge of
it. And then he directed the crossing of Billy
Topsail, who was much lighter, and crossed
safely. Whereupon they set out for the point
of the Little Spotted Horse and the passage of
Tickle-my-Ribs. And they were heartened.



A country physician might say of a muddy,
midnight call, in the wind and dark of a wet
night in the fall of the year, that the roads were[144]
bad. Doctor Luke would have said of the way
from Our Harbour to the Little Spotted Horse
that he had been "in a bit of a mess." Thus
far there had been nothing extravagantly uncommon
in the night's experience. Doctor
Luke and Billy Topsail had merely encountered
and survived the familiar difficulties of a passage
of Anxious Bight in a period of critical weather
in the spring of the year.

A folded floe and six miles of rubber ice were
not sufficiently out of the way to constitute an
impressive incident. Doctor Luke had fared
better and worse in his time. So had Billy Topsail.
All this was not a climax. It was something
to be forgotten in a confusion of experiences
of the same description. It would not
remain very long in the memory of either. In
what lay ahead, however       the passage of Tickle-my-Ribs       there
was doubtless an adventure.

"She'll be heavin' in this wind," Billy Topsail
said.

"We'll get across," Doctor Luke replied, confidently.
"Come along!"

Tickle-my-Ribs was heaving. The sea had by
this time eaten its way clear through the passage
from the open to the first reaches of Anxious[145]
Bight and far and wide beyond. The channel
was half a mile long       in width a quarter of a
mile at the narrowest. Doctor Luke's path was
determined. It must lead from the point of the
island to the base of Blow-me-Down Dick and
the adjoining fixed and solid ice of the narrows
to Ragged Run Harbour. And ice choked the
channel loosely from shore to shore.

It was a thin sheet of fragments       running
through from the open. There was only an occasional
considerable pan. A high sea ran outside.
Waves from the open slipped under this
field of little pieces and lifted it in running swells.
In motion Tickle-my-Ribs resembled a vigorously
shaken carpet. No single block of ice was
at rest. The crossing would have been hazardous
in the most favourable circumstances. And
now aloft the moon and the ominous bank of
black cloud had come close together.

Precisely as a country doctor might petulantly
regard a stretch of hub-deep cross-road, Doctor
Luke, the outport physician, when he came to
the channel between the Little Spotted Horse
and Blow-me-Down Dick of the Ragged Run
coast, regarded the passage of Tickle-my-Ribs.
Not many of the little pans would bear the[146]
weight of either himself or Billy Topsail. They
would sustain it momentarily. Then they
would tip or sink. There would be foothold
only through the instant required to choose
another foothold and leap towards it.

Always, moreover, the leap would have to be
taken from sinking ground. When they came,
by good chance, to a pan that would bear them
up for a moment, they would have instantly to
discover another heavy block to which to shape
their agitated course. There would be no rest       no
certainty beyond the impending moment.
But leaping thus       alert and agile and daring       a
man might              

Might? Mm-m       a man might! And he
might not! There were contingencies. A man
might leap short and find black water where he
had depended upon a footing of ice       a man
might land on the edge of a pan and fall slowly
back for sheer lack of power to obtain a balance       a
man might misjudge the strength of a pan
to bear him up       a man might find no ice near
enough for the next immediately imperative
leap       a man might confront the appalling exigency
of a lane of open water.

As a matter of fact, a man might be unable[147]
either to go forward or retreat. A man might
be submerged and find the shifting floe closed
over his head. A man might easily lose his life
in the driving, swelling rush of the shattered floe
through Tickle-my-Ribs. And there was the
light to consider. A man might be caught in
the dark. He would be in hopeless case if
caught in the dark. And the light might              

Light was imperative. Doctor Luke glanced
aloft.

"Whew!" he whistled. "What do you think,
Billy?"

Billy was flat.

"I'd not try it!" said he.

"No?"

"No, sir!"

The moon and the ominous bank of black
cloud were very close. There was snow in the
air. A thickening flurry ran past.



Uncle Joe West was not on the lookout
when Doctor Luke opened the kitchen door
at Ragged Run Cove, and strode in, with Billy
Topsail at his heels, and with the air of a man
who had survived difficulties and was proud of
it. Uncle Joe West was sitting by the fire, his[148]
face in his hands; and the mother of Dolly
West       with Dolly still restlessly asleep in her
arms       was rocking, rocking, as before. And
Doctor Luke set to work without delay or explanation       in
a way so gentle, with a voice so persuasive,
with a hand so tender and sure, with a
skill and wisdom so keen, that little Dolly West,
who was brave enough, in any case, as you
know, yielded the additional patience and courage
that the simple means at hand for her relief
required. Doctor Luke laved Dolly West's blue
eyes until she could see again, and sewed up her
wounds, that night, so that no scar remained,
and in the broad light of the next day picked
out grains of powder until not a single grain was
left to disfigure the child.



[149]




CHAPTER XX



In Which Skinflint Sam of Ragged Run Finds
Himself in a Desperate Predicament and Bad-Weather
Tom West at Last Has What Skinflint
Sam Wants


Well, now, when all this had been accomplished,
and when Dolly had
gone to bed with her mother, it
occurred to Doctor Luke that he had not
clapped eyes on Dolly's father, Bad-Weather
Tom West.

"Where's Tom?" said he.

Joe started.

"Wh-wh-where's Tom?" he stammered.

"Ay."

"Have you not heard about Tom?"

Doctor Luke was puzzled.

"No," said he; "not a word."

Joe commanded himself for the tale he had to
tell.



"Skipper Tom West," Joe began, "made a
wonderful adventure of life in the end. I doubt
if ever a man done such a queer thing afore.[150]
'Twas queer enough, sir, I'll be bound, an' you'll
say so when I tells you; but 'twas a brave, kind
thing, too, though it come perilous close t' the
line o' foul play       but that's how you looks at it.
Bad-Weather Tom," he went on, "come back
from seein' you, sir, in a silent mood. An' no
wonder! You told un, sir       well, you told un
what you told un, about what he was to expect
in this life; an' the news lay hard on his mood.
He told nobody here what that news was; nor
could the gossips gain a word from his wife.

"'What's the matter with Bad-Weather Tom?'
says they.

"'Ask Tom,' says she.

"An' they asked Tom.

"'Tom,' says they, 'what's gone along o'
you, anyhow?'

"'Well,' says Tom, 'I found out something I
never knowed afore. That's all that's the matter
with me.'

"'Did Doctor Luke tell you?'

"'When I talks with Doctor Luke,' says
Tom, 'I always finds out something I never
knowed afore.'

"Whatever you told un, sir       an' I knows what
you told un       it made a changed man o' Bad-[151]Weather
Tom. He mooned a deal, an' he would
talk no more o' the future, but dwelt upon the
shortness of a man's days an' the quantity of his
sin, an' laboured like mad, an' read the Scriptures
by candle-light, an' sot more store by
going to church and prayer-meetin' than ever
afore. Labour? Ecod, how that poor man
laboured       after you told un. While there was
light! An' until he fair dropped in his tracks
o' sheer weariness!

"'Twas back in the forest       haulin' fire-wood
with the dogs an' storin' it away back o' this
little cottage under Lend-a-Hand Hill.

"'Dear man!' says Skinflint Sam; 'you've
fire-wood for half a dozen winters.'

"'They'll need it,' says Tom.

"'Ay,' says Sam; 'but will you lie idle next
winter?'

"'Nex' winter?' says Tom. An' he laughed.
'Oh, nex' winter,' says he, 'I'll have another
occupation.'

"'Movin' away, Tom?'

"'Well,' says Tom, 'I is an' I isn't.'

"There come a day not long ago when seals
was thick on the floe off Ragged Run. You
mind the time, sir?" Billy Topsail "minded"[152]
the time well enough. And so did Doctor Luke.
It was the time when Billy Topsail and Teddy
Brisk were carried to sea with the dogs on the
ice. "Well, you could see the seals with the
naked eye from Lack-a-Day Head. A hundred
thousand black specks swarmin' over the ice
three miles an' more to sea. Ragged Run went
mad for slaughter       jus' as it did yesterday, sir.
'Twas a fair time for offshore sealin', too: a blue,
still day, with the look an' feel o' settled weather.

"The ice had come in from the current with a
northeasterly gale, a wonderful mixture o' Arctic
bergs and Labrador pans, all blindin' white in
the spring sun; an' 'twas a field so vast, an'
jammed so tight against the coast, that there
wasn't much more than a lane or two an' a
Dutchman's breeches of open water within sight
from the heads. Nobody looked for a gale o'
offshore wind t' blow that ice t' sea afore dawn
o' the next day.

"'A fine, soft time, lads!' says Skinflint Sam.
'I 'low I'll go out with the Ragged Run crew.'

"'Skipper Sam,' says Bad-Weather Tom,
'you're too old a man t' be on the ice.'

"'Ay,' says Sam; 'but I wants t' bludgeon
another swile afore I dies.'

[153]

"'But you creaks, man!'

"'Ah, well,' says Sam; 'I'll show the lads I'm
able t' haul a swile ashore.'

"'Small hope for such as you on a movin'
floe!'

"'Last time, Tom,' says Sam.

"'Last time, true enough,' says Tom, 'if that
ice starts t' sea with a breeze o' wind behind!'

"'Oh, well, Tom,' says Sam, 'I'll creak along
out an' take my chances. If the wind comes up
I'll be as spry as I'm able.'

"It come on to blow in the afternoon. But
'twas short warnin' o' offshore weather. A puff
o' gray wind come down: a saucier gust went
by; an' then a swirl o' galeish wind jumped off
the heads an' come scurrying over the pans. At
the first sign o' wind, Skinflint Sam took for
home, lopin' over the ice as fast as his lungs an'
old legs would take un when pushed, an' nobody
worried about he any more. He was in such mad
haste that the lads laughed behind un as he
passed.

"Most o' the Ragged Run crew followed,
draggin' their swiles; an' them that started early
come safe t' harbour with the fat. But there's
nothin' will master a man's caution like the lust[154]
o' slaughter. Give a Newfoundlander a club, an'
show un a swile-pack, an' he'll venture far from
safety. 'Twas not until a flurry o' snow come
along of a sudden that the last o' the crew
dropped what they was at an' begun t' jump for
shore like a pack o' jack-rabbits.

"With snow in the wind 'twas every man for
himself. An' that means no mercy an' less help.

"By this time the ice had begun t' feel the
wind. 'Twas restless. An' a bad promise.
The pans crunched an' creaked as they settled
more at ease. The ice was goin' abroad. As
the farther fields drifted off t' sea, the floe fell
loose inshore. Lanes an' pools opened up.
The cake-ice tipped an' went awash under the
weight of a man. Rough goin', ecod! There
was no tellin' when open water would cut a man
off where he stood.

"An' the wind was whippin' offshore, an' the
snow was like dust in a man's eyes an' mouth,
an' the landmarks o' Ragged Run was nothin'
but shadows in a mist o' snow t' windward.

"Nobody knowed where Skinflint Sam was.
Nobody thought about Sam. An' wherever poor
old Skinflint was       whether safe ashore or creakin'
shoreward against the wind on his last legs       he[155]
must do for himself. 'Twas no time t' succour
rich or poor. Every man for himself an' the
devil take the hindmost!

"Bound out, in the mornin', Bad-Weather
Tom had fetched his rodney through the lanes.
By luck an' good conduct he had managed t' get
the wee boat a fairish way out. He had beached
her there on the floe       a big pan, close by a
hummock which he marked with care. And
'twas for Tom West's little rodney that the seven
last men o' Ragged Run was jumpin'. With
her afloat       an' the pack loosenin' inshore under
the wind       they could make harbour well enough
afore the gale worked up the water in the lee o'
the Ragged Run hills.

"But she was a mean, small boat. There was
room for six, with safety       but room for no more.
There was no room for seven. 'Twas a nasty
mess, t' be sure. You couldn't expect nothin'
else. But there wasn't no panic. Ragged Run
men is accustomed t' tight places. An' they took
this one easy. Them that got there first launched
the boat an' stepped in. No fight: no fuss.

"It just happened t' be Eleazer Butt that was
left. 'Twas Eleazer's ill-luck. An' Eleazer was
up in years an' had fell behind comin' over the ice.

[156]

"'No room for me?' says he.

"'Twas sure death t' be left on the ice. The
wind begun t' taste o' frost. An' 'twas jumpin'
up. 'Twould carry the floe far an' scatter it
broadcast.

"'See for yourself, lad,' says Tom.

"'Pshaw!' says Eleazer. 'That's too bad!'

"'You isn't no sorrier than me, b'y.'

"Eleazer tweaked his beard. 'Dang it!'
says he. 'I wisht there was room. I'm hungry
for my supper.'

"'Let un in,' says one of the lads. ''Tis even
chances she'll float it out.'

"'Well,' says Eleazer, 'I doesn't want t' make
no trouble              '

"'Come aboard,' says Tom. 'An' make
haste.'

"'If she makes bad weather,' says Eleazer,
'I'll get out.'

"We pushed off from the pan. 'Twas failin'
dusk by this time. The wind blowed black.
The frost begun t' bite. Snow come thick       just
as if, ecod, somebody up aloft was shakin' the
clouds, like bags, in the gale! An' the rodney
was deep an' ticklish.

"Had the ice not kep' the water flat in the[157]
lanes an' pools, either Eleazer would have had to
get out, as he promised, or she would have
swamped like a cup. As it was, handled like
dynamite, she done well enough; an' she might
have made harbour within the hour had she not
been hailed by Skinflint Sam from a small pan
o' ice midway between."

Doctor Luke and Billy Topsail were intent on
the tale.

"Go on," said Doctor Luke.

"A queer finish, sir."

"What happened?"



[158]




CHAPTER XXI



In Which a Cr       sus of Ragged Run Drives a Hard
Bargain in a Gale of Wind


"An' there the ol' codger was squattin',"
Skipper Joe's tale went on, "his ol'
face pinched an' woebegone, his bag o'
bones wrapped up in his coonskin coat, his pan
near flush with the sea, with little black waves
already beginnin' t' wash over it.

"A sad sight, believe me! Poor old Skinflint
Sam bound out t' sea without hope on a wee pan
o' ice!

"'Got any room for me?' says he.

"We ranged alongside.

"'She's too deep as it is,' says Tom. 'I'm
wonderful sorry, Skipper Sam.'

"An' he was.

"'Ay,' says Sam; 'you isn't got room for no
more. She'd sink if I put foot in her.'

"'Us'll come back,' says Tom.

"'No use, Tom,' says Sam. 'You knows
that well enough. 'Tis no place out here for a
Ragged Run punt. Afore you could get t' shore[159]
an' back night will be down an' this here gale
will be a blizzard. You'd never be able t' find
me.'

"'I 'low not,' says Tom.

"'Oh, no,' says Sam. 'No use, b'y.'

"'Skipper Sam,' says Tom, 'I'm sorry!'

"'Ay,' says Sam; ''tis a sad death for an ol'
man       squattin' out here all alone on the ice an'
shiverin' with the cold until he shakes his poor
damned soul out.'

"'Not damned!' cries Tom. 'Oh, don't say
it!'

"'Ah, well!' says Sam; 'sittin' here all alone
I been thinkin'.'

"''Tisn't by any man's wish that you're here,
poor man!' says Tom.

"'Oh, no,' says Sam. 'No blame t' nobody.
My time's come. That's all. But I wisht I had
a seat in your rodney, Tom.'

"An' then Tom chuckled.

"'What you laughin' at?' says Sam.

"'I got a comical idea,' says Tom.

"'Laughin' at me, Tom?'

"'Oh, I'm jus' laughin'.'

'"'Tis neither time nor place, Tom,' says Sam,
't' laugh at an old man.'

[160]

"Tom roared. Ay, he slapped his knee, an'
he throwed back his head, an' he roared! 'Twas
enough almost t' swamp the boat.

"'For shame!' says Sam.

"An' more than Skinflint Sam thought so.

"'Skipper Sam,' says Tom, 'you're rich,
isn't you?'

"'I got money,' says Sam.

"'Sittin' out here all alone,' says Tom, 'you
been thinkin' a deal, you says?'

"'Well,' says Sam, 'I'll not deny that I been
havin' a little spurt o' sober thought.'

"'You been thinkin' that money wasn't much,
after all?'

"'Ay.'

"'An' that all your money in a lump wouldn't
buy you passage ashore?'

"'Oh, some few small thoughts on that order,'
says Sam. ''Tis perfectly natural.'

"'Money talks,' says Tom.

"'Tauntin' me again, Tom?'

"'No, I isn't,' says Tom. 'I means it.
Money talks. What'll you give for my seat in
the boat?'

"''Tis not for sale, Tom.'

"The lads begun t' grumble. It seemed just[161]
as if Bad-Weather Tom West was makin' game
of an ol' man in trouble. 'Twas either that or
lunacy. An' there was no time for nonsense off
the Ragged Run coast in a spring gale of wind.
But I knowed what Tom West was about. You
sees, sir, I knowed what you told him. An' as
for me, fond as I was o' poor Tom West, I had
no mind t' interrupt his bargain.

"'Hist!' Tom whispered t' the men in the
rodney. 'I knows what I'm doin'.'

"'A mad thing, Tom!'

"'Oh, no!' says Tom. ''Tis the cleverest
thing ever I thought of. Well,' says he to Sam,
'how much?'

"'No man sells his life.'

"'Life or no life, my place in this boat is for
sale,' says Tom. 'Money talks. Come, now.
Speak up. Us can't linger here with night
comin' down.'

"'What's the price, Tom?'

"'How much you got, Sam?'

"'Ah, well, I can afford a stiffish price, Tom.
Anything you say in reason will suit me. You
name the price, Tom. I'll pay.'

"'Ay, ye crab!' says Tom. 'I'm namin'
prices, now. Look you, Sam! You're seventy-[162]three.
I'm fifty-three. Will you grant that I'd
live t' be as old as you?'

"'I'll grant it, Tom.'

"'I'm not sayin' I would,' says Tom. 'You
mark that.'

"'Ah, well, I'll grant it, anyhow.'

"'I been an industrious man all my life, Skipper
Sam. None knows it better than you. Will
you grant that I'd earn a hundred and fifty dollars
a year if I lived?'

"'Ay, Tom.'

"Down come a gust o' wind.

"'Have done!' says one of the lads. 'Here's
the gale come down with the dark. Us'll all be
cast away.'

"'Rodney's mine, isn't she?' says Tom.

"Well, she was. Nobody could say nothin' t'
that. An' nobody did.

"'That's three thousand dollars, Sam,' says
Tom. 'Three       thousand       dollars!'

"'Ay,' says Sam, 'she calculates that way.
But you've forgot t' deduct your livin' from the
total. Not that I minds,' says he. ''Tis just a
business detail.'

"'I'll not be harsh!' says Tom.

"'Another thing, Tom,' says Sam. 'You're[163]
askin' me t' pay for twenty years o' life
when I can use but a few. God knows how
many!'

"'I got you where I wants you,' says Tom,
'but I isn't got the heart t' grind you. Will you
pay two thousand dollars for my seat in the
boat?'

"'If you is fool enough t' take it, Tom.'

"'There's something t' boot,' says Tom. 'I
wants t' die out o' debt.'

"'You does, Tom.'

"'An' my father's bill is squared?'

"'Ay.'

"''Tis a bargain!' says Tom. 'God witness!'

"'Lads,' says Skinflint Sam t' the others in
the rodney, 'I calls you t' witness that I didn't
ask Tom West for his seat in the boat. I isn't no
coward. I've asked no man t' give up his life
for me. This here bargain is a straight business
deal. Business is business. 'Tis not my proposition.
An' I calls you t' witness that I'm
willin' t' pay what he asks. He've something for
sale. I wants it. I've the money t' buy it. The
price is his. I'll pay it.'

"Then he turned to Tom.

[164]

"'You wants this money paid t' your wife,
Tom?' says he.

"'Ay,' says Tom, 't' my wife. She'll know
why.'

"'Very good,' says Skinflint. 'You've my
word that I'll do it.' An' then: 'Wind's jumpin'
up, Tom.'

"'I wants your oath. The wind will bide for
that. Hold up your right hand.'

"Skinflint shivered in a blast o' the gale.

"'I swears,' says he.

"'Lads,' says Tom, 'you'll shame this man to
his grave if he fails t' pay!'

"'Gettin' dark, Tom,' says Sam.

"'Ay,' says Tom; ''tis growin' wonderful
cold an' dark out here. I knows it well. Put
me ashore on the ice, lads,' says he.

"We landed Tom, then, on a near-by pan.
He would have it so.

"'Leave me have my way!' says he. 'I've
done a good stroke o' business.'

"Presently we took ol' Skinflint aboard in
Tom's stead; an' jus' for a minute we hung off
Tom's pan t' say good-bye.

"'I sends my love t' the wife an' the children,'
says he. 'You'll not fail t' remember. She'll[165]
know why I done this thing. Tell her 'twas a
grand chance an' I took it.'

"'Ay, Tom.'

"'Fetch in here close,' says Tom. 'I wants
t' talk t' the ol' skinflint you got aboard there.
I'll have my say, ecod, at last! Ye crab!' says
he, shakin' his fist in Skinflint's face when the
rodney got alongside. 'Ye robber! Ye pinch-a-penny!
Ye liar! Ye thief! I done ye!
Hear me? I done ye! I vowed I'd even scores
with ye afore I died. An' I've done it       I've
done it! What did ye buy? Twenty years o'
my life! What will ye pay for? Twenty years
o' my life!'

"An' Tom laughed. An' then he cut a caper,
an' come close t' the edge o' the pan, an' shook
his fist in Skinflint's face again.

"'Know what I found out from Doctor
Luke?' says he. 'I seen Doctor Luke, ye crab!
Know what he told me? No, ye don't! Twenty
years o' my life this here ol' skinflint will pay
for!' he crowed. 'Two thousand dollars he'll
put in the hands o' my poor wife!'

"Well, well! The rodney was movin' away.
An' a swirl o' snow shrouded poor Tom West.
But we heard un laugh once more.

[166]

"'My heart has give 'way!' he yelled. 'I
didn't have three months t' live! An' Doctor
Luke tol' me so!'



"Well, now, sir," Skipper Joe concluded,
"Skinflint done what he said he would do. He
laid the money in the hands o' Tom West's wife
last week. But a queer thing happened next
day. Up went the price o' pork at Skinflint's
shop! And up went the price o' tea an' molasses!
An' up went the price o' flour!"



[167]




CHAPTER XXII



In Which Doctor Luke and Billy Topsail Go
North, and at Candlestick Cove, Returning,
Doctor Luke Finds Himself Just a Bit Peckish


A rumour came to Our Harbour, by
the tongue of a fur-trader, who stopped
over night at Doctor Luke's hospital,
on his way to the South, that there was sickness
in the North       some need or other; the fur-trader
was not sure what. Winter still lingered.
The mild spell, which had interrupted the journey
of Billy Topsail and Teddy Brisk across Schooner
Bay, had been a mere taste of spring. Hard
weather had followed. Schooner Bay was once
more jammed with ice, which had drifted back       jammed
and frozen solid; and the way from
Our Harbour to Tight Cove was secure. Teddy
Brisk was ready to be moved; and this being so,
and the lad being homesick for his mother, and
the rumour of need in the North coming down       all
this being so, Doctor Luke determined
all at once to revisit the northern outports for
the last time that winter.

[168]

"Are you ready for home, Teddy?" said he.

"I is that, sir!"

"Well," Doctor Luke concluded, "there is no
reason why you should not be home. I'll harness
the dogs to-morrow and take you across
Schooner Bay on the komatik."

"Billy Topsail comin', sir?"

"What say, Billy?"

"May I go, sir?"

"You may."

"All the way, sir?"

"All the way!" cried Doctor Luke. "Why,
boy, I'm going north to              "

"Please, sir!"

"Well, well! If you've the mind. Come
along, boy. I'll be glad to have you."

Teddy Brisk was taken across Schooner Bay
and restored to his mother's arms. And Doctor
Luke and Billy Topsail drove the dogs north on
Doctor Luke's successful round of visits.



It was on the return journey that Doctor Luke
and Billy Topsail fell in with the Little Fiddler
of Amen Island. At Candlestick Cove they were
to feed the dogs and put up for the night. It
was still treacherous March weather; and the[169]
night threatened foul       a flurry of snow falling
and the sky overcast with a thickening drab
scud. Day was done when Doctor Luke and
Billy Topsail crawled out of the timber and scurried
down Twist Hill. In the early dusk the
lights were already twinkling yellow and warm
in the cottages below; and from the crest of the
long hill, in the last of the light, Amen Island was
visible, an outlying shadow, across Ships' Run.

There were still sixty miles left of Doctor
Luke's round       this second winter round from
Our Harbour to the lonely huts of Laughter
Bight, thirty miles north of Cape Blind, touching
all the harbours between, and by way of Thunder
Tickle and Candlestick Cove, which lay midway,
back to the shaded lamp and radiant open
fire of the little surgery at Our Harbour.

As the dogs scurried down Twist Hill, whimpering
and snarling, eager to make an end of a
hard day, Doctor Luke visioned those wintry
miles and reflected upon the propriety of omitting
a call at Amen Island.

Doctor Luke and Billy Topsail drew up at
Mild Jim Cull's.

"Skipper James," said Doctor Luke, in the
kitchen, across the lamp-lit, devastated supper[170]
table, an hour later, "what's the health of Amen
Island?"

"They're all well, sir       so far as I knows."

"All well? Just my luck! Then I won't              "

"Amanda," Skipper James admonished his
wife, in a grieved whisper, "the Doctor is
wantin' another cup o' tea."

The good woman was astonished.

"He've had              " she began.

Then she blushed       and grasped the pot in a
fluster       and              

"Thank you       no more," the Doctor protested.

"Ah, now, sir              "

"No more. Really, you know! I've quite
finished. I       well       I       if you please, Mrs. Cull.
Half a cup. No more. Thank you."

"An' Billy Topsail, too," said Skipper James.

Billy was abashed.

"No       really!" he began. "I       well       thank
you       half a cup!"

"All fit an' well, sir, as I says," Skipper James
repeated, relieved, now resuming his conversation
with Doctor Luke       "so far as I knows."

"Anybody come across Ships' Run lately?"

"Well, no, sir       nobody but ol' Jack Hulk.
Another slice o' pork, Doctor?"

[171]

The youngest little Cull tittered, astounded:

"He've had              "

Amanda covered the youngest little Cull's lips
just in time with a soft hand.

"Thank you       no," the Doctor protested again.
"I'm quite finished. Nothing more       really!
Well," he yielded       "if you will              "

"You, too, Billy Topsail?" said Skipper
James.

"Nothing more, really!" Billy replied, with a
grin. And then: "Well       if you will              "

"No; nobody but ol' Jack Hulk," said Skipper
James to Doctor Luke.

"Jack Hulk, you say? Hm-m. When was
that?"

"I don't rightly remember, sir. 'Twas less
than a fortnight ago. I'll lay t' that much."

"And all well over there?"

"No report o' sickness, sir. Have another
cut o' bread, sir, while you're about it."

The Doctor lifted his hand.

"No       really," said he, positively. "No more.
Well       I       if you please. Thank you. I seem to
be just a bit peckish to-night."

"A cut o' bread, Billy?" said Skipper James.

Billy lifted his hand.

[172]

"Not a bite!" he protested. And he winked.
"Ah, well," he yielded, "might as well, I 'low.
Really, now, I is jus' a bit peckish the night."

"No; no report o' sickness on Amen," Skipper
James repeated, resuming his conversation,
as before.

"Quite sure about that?"

"Well, sir," Skipper James replied, his gray
eyes twinkling, "I asked ol' Jack Hulk, an' he
said, 'All well on Amen Island. The Lord's
been wonderful easy on us this winter. I'd almost
go so far as t' say,' says he, 'that He've
been lax. We've had no visitation o' the Lord,'
says he, 'since the fall o' the year. We don't
deserve this mercy. I'm free t' say that. We
isn't been livin' as we should. There's been
more frivolity on Amen Island this winter than
ever afore in my time. It haven't been noticed
so far,' says he. 'That's plain enough. An' so
as yet,' says he, 'we're all well on Amen Island.'"

The Doctor grinned.

"What's the ice on Ships' Run?" said he.

"'Tis tumbled, sir. The bread's at your elbow,
sir."

"Thank you. Dogs?"

[173]

"No, sir. Ships' Run's jammed with floe ice.
A man would have t' foot it across. You bound
over, sir?"

Doctor Luke deliberated.

"I think not," said he, then. "No." This
was positive. "If they're all as well as that on
Amen Island I'll get away for Our Harbour at
noon to-morrow. No; no more       really. I       well       I'm
almost wolfish, I declare. Thank you       if
you please       just a sma-a-all              "

Billy Topsail burst out laughing.

"What's this mirth?" cried the Doctor.

"Well, sir," Billy chuckled, "you is jus' a bit
peckish the night, sir!"

There was a burst of laughter. At that moment,
however, in a cottage on Amen Island,
across Ships' Run, nobody was laughing       least
of all the Little Fiddler of Amen Island.



[174]




CHAPTER XXIII



In Which, While Doctor Luke and Billy Topsail
Rest Unsuspecting at Candlestick Cove, Tom
Lute, the Father of the Little Fiddler of Amen
Island, Sharpens an Axe in the Wood-Shed, and
the Reader is Left to Draw His Own Conclusions
Respecting the Sinister Business


It was the boast of the Little Fiddler of
Amen Island that he had lamed many a man
and maid. "An' ecod!" said he, his blue
eyes alight, his clean little teeth showing in a
mischievous grin, his round cheeks flushed with
delight in the gift of power; "there's no leg between
the Norman Light an' Cape Mugford so
sodden it can balk me when I've the wind in my
favour!"       meaning to imply, with more truth
than modesty, that the alluring invitation of his
music was altogether irresistible when he was in
the mood to provoke a response.

"Had I the will," said he, "I could draw tears
from the figurehead o' the Roustabout. An' one
o' these days, when I've the mind t' show my
power," said he, darkly, "maybe I'll do it, too!"

He was young       he was twelve. Terry Lute[175]
was his name. To be known as the Little Fiddler
of Amen Island as far north as the world of
that coast sailed was the measure of the celebrity
he coveted. And that was a good deal: it is a
long way for fame to carry       north to the uttermost
fishing-berths of the Labrador. Unquestionably
the Little Fiddler of Amen Island was
of the proportions of a Master.

It was aboard a trading schooner       a fly-by-night
visitor at Amen Island (not Skinflint
Sam's trader from Ragged Run)       that the
Little Fiddler of Amen Island had first clapped
eyes on a fiddle and heard the strains of it.
That was long ago       oh, long, long ago! Terry
Lute was a mere child, then, as he recalled, in a
wistful amusement with those old days, and was
accustomed to narrate       seven or thereabouts.
An' 'twas the month o' June       sweet weather,
ecod! (said he) an' after dark an' the full o' the
moon. And Terry had harkened to the strain       some
plaintive imaginings of the melancholy
clerk in the cabin, perhaps; and he had not been
able to bear more       not another wail or sob of it
(said he)       but had run full tilt to his mother's
knee to tell her first of all the full wonder of the
adventure.

[176]

'Twas called a fiddle (said he)       'twas played
with what they called a bow; an' oh, woman
(said he), what music could be made by means
of it! And Terry could play it       he had seen
the clerk sawin' away       sawin' an' sawin' away;
an' he had learned how 'twas done jus' by lookin'       in
a mere peep. 'Twas nothin' at all t' do
(said he)       not a whit o' bother for a clever lad.
Jus' give un a fiddle an' a bow       he'd show un
how 'twas done!

"I got t' have one, mama!" he declared.
"Oo-sh! I jus' got t'!"

His mother laughed at this fine fervour.

"Mark me!" he stormed. "I'll have one o'
they fiddles afore very long. An' I'll have folk
fair shakin' their legs off t' the music I makes!"



When old Bob Likely, the mail-man, travelling
afoot, southbound from Elegant Tickle to Our
Harbour and the lesser harbours of Mad Harry
and Thank-the-Lord, a matter of eighty miles       when
old Bob Likely, on the night of Doctor
Luke's arrival at Candlestick Cove, rounded
Come-Along Point of Amen Island and searched
the shadows ahead for his entertainment, his lodgings
for the night were determined and disclosed.

[177]

It was late       a flurry of snow falling and the
moon overcast with a thickening drab scud;
and old Bob Likely's disheartened expectation
on the tumbled ice of Ships' Run, between Point
o' Bay of the Harbourless Shore and Amen
Island, had consequently discovered the cottages
of his destination dark       the windows black, the
fires dead, the kitchens frosty and the folk of
Amen Island long ago turned in.

Of the thirty cottages of Amen, however,
snuggled under thick blankets of snow, all
asleep in the gray night, one was wide awake       lighted
up as though for some festivity; and
for the hospitality of its lamps and smoking
chimney old Bob Likely shaped his astonished
course.

"'Tis a dance!" he reflected, heartening his
step. "I'll shake a foot if I lame myself!"

Approaching Tom Lute's cottage from the
harbour ice, old Bob Likely cocked his ear for
the thump and shuffle of feet and the lively
music of the Little Fiddler of Amen Island. It
was the Little Fiddler's way to boast: "They'll
sweat the night! Mark me! I'm feelin' fine.
They'll shed their jackets! I'll have their boots
off!"

[178]

And old Bob Likely expected surely to discover
the Little Fiddler, perched on the back
of a chair, the chair aloft on the kitchen table,
mischievously delighting in the abandoned
antics of the dancers, the while a castaway
sealing crew, jackets shed and boots kicked
off, executed a reel with the maids of Amen
Island.

But there was no music       no thump or shuffle
of feet or lively strain; the house was still       except
for a whizz and metallic squeaking in
the kitchen shed to which old Bob Likely made
his way to lay off the sacred bag of His Majesty's
Mail and his own raquets and brush himself
clean of snow.



Tom Lute was whirling a grindstone by candle-light
in the shed. When Bob Likely lifted
the latch and pushed in he was interrupted and
startled.

"Who's that?" he demanded.

"'Tis His Majesty's Mail, Tom."

"That you, Bob?" Tom's drawn face lightened
with heartiness. "Well, well! Come in.
You're welcome. We've need of a lusty man
in this house the night. If the thing haves t'[179]
be done, Bob, you'll come handy for holdin'.
You come across from Candlestick?"

Bob threw off his pack.

"No," said he, "I come over from Point o'
Bay."

"Up from Laughter Bight, Bob?"

"All the way."

"Any word o' Doctor Luke down north?"

"Ay; he's down north somewheres."

"Whereabouts, Bob?"

"I heard of un at Trap Harbour."

"Trap Harbour! Was he workin' north,
Bob?"

"There was sickness at Huddle Cove."

"At Huddle Cove? My, my! 'Tis below
Cape Blind. He'll not be this way in a fortnight.
Oh, dear me!"

By this time His Majesty's Mail was stamping
his feet and brooming the snow from his seal-hide
boots. In answer to his violence the kitchen
door fell ajar. And Bob Likely cocked his ear.
Queer sounds       singular scraps of declaration
and pleading       issued to the wood-shed.

There was the tap-tap of a wooden leg. Bob
Likely identified the presence and agitated pacing
of the maternal grandfather of the Little Fiddler[180]
of Amen Island. And there was a whimper and
a sob. It was the Little Fiddler.

A woman crooned:

"Hush, dear       ah, hush, now!"

A high-pitched, querulous voice:

"That's what we done when I sailed along o'
Small Sam Small aboard the Royal Bloodhound."
And repeated, the wooden leg tap-tapping meanwhile:
"That's what we done aboard the Royal
Bloodhound. Now, mark me! That's what we
done t' Cap'n Small Sam Small."

A young roar, then:

"I'll never have it done t' me!"

And the woman again:

"Ah, hush, dear! Never mind! Ah       hush,
now!"

To which there responded a defiant bawl:

"I tells you I won't have it done t' me!"

By all this, to be sure, old Bob Likely, with
his ear cocked and his mouth fallen open in
amazement, was deeply mystified.

"Look you, Tom!" said he, suspiciously;
"what you doin' out here in the frost?"

"Who? Me?" Tom was evasive and downcast.

"Ay."

[181]

"Nothin' much."

"'Tis a cold place for that, Tom. An' 'tis a
poor lie you're tellin'. 'Tis easy t' see, Tom,
that you're busy."

"Ah, well, I got a little job on hand."

"What is your job?"

"This here little job I'm doin' now?"

"Ay."

"Nothin' much."

"What is it?"

Tom was reluctant. "I'm puttin' an edge on
my axe," he replied.

"What for, Tom?"

Tom hesitated. "Well              " he drawled.
And then, abruptly: "Nothin' much." He
was both grieved and agitated.

"But what for?"

"I wants it good an' sharp."

"What you want it good an' sharp for?"

"An axe serves best," Tom evaded, "when
'tis sharp."

"Look you, Tom!" said Bob; "you're behavin'
in a very queer way, an' I gives you
warnin' o' the fac'. What happens? Here I
comes quite unexpected on you by candle-light
in the shed. Who is I? I'm His Majest[182]y's
Mail. Mark that, Tom! An' what does I find
you doin'? Puttin' an edge on an axe. I asks
you why you're puttin' an edge on your axe.
An' you won't tell. If I didn't know you for a
mild man, Tom, I'd fancy you was tired o' your
wife."

"Tired o' my wife!" Tom exploded, indignantly.
"I isn't goin' t' kill my wife!"

"Who is you goin' t' kill?"

"I isn't goin' t' kill nobody."

"Well, what you goin' t' kill?"

"I isn't goin' t' kill nothin'."

"Well, then," Bob burst out, "what in thunder
is you puttin' an edge on your axe for out here
in the frost by candle-light at this time o'
night?"

"Who? Me?"

"Ay       you!"

"I got some doctorin' t' do."

Bob lifted his brows. "Hum!" he coughed.
"You usually do your doctorin' with an axe?"
he inquired.

"No," said Tom, uneasily; "not with an axe."

"What you usually use, Tom?"

"What I usually uses, Bob," Tom replied, "is
a decoction an' a spoon."

[183]

"Somebody recommend an axe for this complaint?"

"'Tisn't that, Bob. 'Tis this way. When I
haves a job t' do, Bob, I always uses what serves
best an' lies handy. That's jus' plain common
sense an' cleverness. Well, then, jus' now an
axe suits me to a tee. An' so I'm puttin' a good
edge on the only axe I got."

"An axe," Bob observed, "will do quick
work."

"That's jus' what I thought!" cried Tom, delighted.
"Quick an' painless."

"There's jus' one trouble about an axe," Bob
went on, dryly, "when used in the practice o'
medicine. I never heard it stated       but I fancy
'tis true. What's done with an axe," he concluded,
"is hard t' repair."



[184]




CHAPTER XXIV



In Which Bob Likely, the Mail-Man, Interrupts
Doctor Luke's Departure, in the Nick of Time,
with an Astonishing Bit of News, and the
Ice of Ships' Run Begins to Move to Sea in a
Way to Alarm the Stout Hearted


Doctor Luke, having finished his
professional round of the Candlestick
cottages in good time, harnessed his
dogs, with the help of Billy Topsail, soon after
noon next day. Evidently the folk of Amen
Island were well. They had been frivolous, no
doubt       but had not been caught at it. Amen
Island was to be omitted. Doctor Luke was
ready for the trail to Poor Luck Harbour on the
way south. And he shouted a last good-bye to
the folk of Candlestick Cove, who had gathered
to wish him Godspeed, and laughed in delighted
satisfaction with their affection, and waved his
hand, and called to his dogs and cracked his
whip; and he would have been gone south from
Candlestick Cove on the way to Poor Luck and
Our Harbour in another instant had he not caught[185]
sight of Bob Likely coming up the harbour ice
from the direction of the Arctic floe that was
then beginning to drive through Ships' Run
under the impulse of a stiffening breeze from the
north.

It was old Bob Likely with the mail-bag on
his back       there was no doubt about that; the
old man's stride and crooked carriage were
everywhere familiar       and as he was doubtless
from Amen Island, and as he carried the gossip
of the coast on the tip of his tongue, of which
news of illness and death was not the lest interesting
variety, Doctor Luke, alert for intelligence
that might serve the ends of his work       Doctor
Luke halted his team and waited for old Bob
Likely to draw near.

"From Amen, Bob?"

"I is, sir. I'm jus' come across the floe."

"Are they all well?"

"Well, no, sir; they isn't. The Little Fiddler
is in mortal trouble. I fears, sir, he's bound
Aloft."

"Hut!" the Doctor scoffed. "What's the
matter with the Little Fiddler?"

"He've a sore finger, sir."

The Doctor pondered this. He frowned       [186]perplexed.
"What sort of a sore finger?" he
inquired, troubled.

"They thinks 'tis mortification, sir."

"Gangrene! What do you think, Bob?"

"It looks like it, sir. I seed a case, sir, when
I were off sealin' on the              "

"Was the finger bruised?"

"No, sir; 'twasn't bruised."

"Was it frost-bitten?"

"No, sir; 'twasn't the frost that done it. I
made sure o' that. It come from a small cut,
sir."

"A simple infection, probably. Did you see a
line of demarcation?"

"Sir?"

"It was discoloured?"

"Oh, ay, sir! 'Twas some queer sort o' colour."

"What colour?"

"Well, sir," said Bob, cautiously, "I wouldn't
say as t' that. I'd jus' say 'twas some mortal
queer sort o' colour an' be content with my
labour."

"Was there a definite line between the discolouration
and what seemed to be sound
flesh?"

Bob Likely scratched his head in doubt.

[187]

"I don't quite mind," said he, "whether there
was or not."

"Then there was not," the Doctor declared,
relieved. "You would not have failed to note
that line. 'Tis not gangrene. The lad's all
right. That's good. Everybody else well on
Amen Island?"

Bob was troubled.

"They're t' cut that finger off," said he, "jus'
as soon as little Terry will yield. Las' night, sir,
we wasn't able t' overcome his objection. 'Tis
what he calls one of his fiddle fingers, sir, an'
he's holdin' out              "

"Cut it off? Absurd! They'll not do that."

"Ay; but they will, sir. 'Tis t' be done the
night, sir, with the help o' Sandy Lands an'
Black Walt Anderson. They're t' cotch un an'
hold un, sir. They'll wait no longer. They're
afeared o' losin' little Terry altogether."

"Yes; but surely              "

"If 'twere mortification, sir, wouldn't you cut
that finger off?"

"At once."

"With an axe?"

"If I had nothing better."

"An' if the lad was obstinate              "

[188]

"If an immediate operation seemed to be
advisable, Bob, I would have the lad held."

"Well, sir," said Bob, "they thinks 'tis mortification,
sir, an' not knowin' no better              "

"Thank you," said the Doctor. He turned to
Mild Jim Cull. "Skipper James," said he,
"have Timmie take care of the dogs. I'll cross
Ships' Run and lance that finger."



Dusk fell on Amen Island. No doctor had
happened across the Run. No saving help       no
help of any sort, except the help of Sandy Lands
and Black Walt Anderson, to hold the rebellious
subject       had come.

At Candlestick Cove Doctor Luke had been
delayed. The great news of his fortunate passing
had spread inland overnight to the tilts of Rattle
River. Before the Doctor could get under way
for Amen Island, an old dame of Serpent Bend,
who had come helter-skelter through the timber,
whipping her team, frantic to be in time to command
relief before the Doctor's departure, drove
up alone, with four frowsy dogs, and desired the
extraction of a tooth; but so fearful and coy was
she       notwithstanding that she had suffered the
tortures of the damned, as she put it, for three[189]
months, having missed the Doctor on his northern
course       that the Doctor was kept waiting
on her humour an hour or more before she would
yield to his scoldings and blandishments.

And no sooner had the old dame of Serpent
Bend been rejoiced to receive her recalcitrant
tooth in a detached relationship than a lad of
Trapper's Lake trudged in to expose a difficulty
that turned out to be neither more nor less than
a pitiable effect of the lack of nourishment; and
when an arrangement had been accomplished to
feed the lad well and strong again, a woman of
Silver Fox was driven in       a matter that occupied
Doctor Luke until the day was near spent and
the crossing of Ships' Run was a hazard to be
rather gravely debated.

"You'll put it off, sir?" Skipper James advised.

The Doctor surveyed the ice of Ships' Run
and the sky beyond Amen Island.

"I wish I might," said he, frankly.

"I would, sir."

"I       I can't very well."

"The floe's started down the Run, sir."

"Yes-s," the Doctor admitted, uneasily; "but
you see, Skipper James, I       I              "



[190]




CHAPTER XXV



In Which a Stretch of Slush is to be Crossed and
Billy Topsail Takes the Law in His Own
Hands


It was falling dusk and blowing up when
Doctor Luke and Billy Topsail, gaffs in hand,
left the heads of Candlestick Cove for the ice
of Ships' Run; and a spit of frosty snow       driving
in straight lines       was in the gale. Amen Island,
lying nearly in the wind's eye, was hardly distinguishable,
through the misty interval, from the
blue-black sky beyond.

There was more wind in the northeast       more
snow and a more penetrating degree of frost. It
was already blowing at the pitch of half a gale:
it would rise to a gale in the night, thick with
snow, it might be, and blowing bitter cold       the
wind jumping over the point of Amen Island on
a diagonal and sweeping down the Run.

Somewhere to leeward of Candlestick Cove
the jam had yielded to the rising pressure of the
wind. The floe was outward bound from the[191]
Run. It was already moving in the channel,
scraping the rocks of both shores       moving faster
as the pans below ran off to open water and removed
their restraint.

As yet the pans and hummocks were in reasonably
sure contact all the way from Candlestick
Cove to Come-Along Point of Amen Island; but
the ice was thinning out with accelerating speed       black
water disclosing itself in widening gaps       as
the compression was relieved. All the while,
thus, as Doctor Luke and Billy Topsail made
across, the path was diminishing.



In the slant of the wind the ice in the channel
of Ships' Run was blown lightly against the
Candlestick coast. About the urgent business of
its escape to the wide water of Great Yellow Bay
the floe rubbed the Candlestick rocks in passing
and crushed around the corner of Dead Man's
Point.

Near Amen Island, where the wind fell with
less force, there was a perilous line of separation.
In the lee of the Amen hills       close inshore       the
ice was not disturbed: it hugged the coast as before;
but outward of this       where the wind
dropped down       a lane of water was opening be[192]tween
the inert shore ice and the wind-blown
main floe.

As yet the lane was narrow; and there were
pans in it       adrift and sluggishly moving away
from the Amen shore. When Doctor Luke and
Billy Topsail came to this widening breach they
were delayed       the course was from pan to pan
in a direction determined by the exigency of the
moment; and when they had drawn near the
coast of Amen       having advanced in a general
direction as best they could       they were halted
altogether.

And they were not then under Come-Along
Point, but on a gathering of heavy Arctic ice, to
the north, at the limit of Ships' Run, under that
exposed head of Amen, called Deep Water
Head, which thrusts itself into the open sea.

"We're stopped, sir," Billy Topsail declared.
"We'd best turn back, sir, while there's time."

A way of return was still open. It would be
laborious       nothing worse.

"One moment              "

"No chance, sir."

"I'm an agile man, Billy. One moment.
I              "

Billy Topsail turned his back to a blast of the[193]
gale and patiently awaited the issue of Doctor
Luke's inspection of the path.

"A man can't cross that slush, sir," said he.

Past Deep Water Head the last of the floe was
driving. There is a wide little cove there       it is
called Deep Water Cove; and there is deep
water       a drop of ten fathoms (they say)       under
Deep Water Cliff. There was open water in
both directions beyond the points of the cove.
A detour was thus interrupted.

Doctor Luke and Billy Topsail confronted the
only ice that was still in contact with the shore.
At no time had the floe extended far beyond
Deep Water Head. A high sea, rolling in from
the northeast, had played under the ice; and this
had gone on for three days       the seas running in
and subsiding: all the while casting the ice
ponderously against the rocks.

Heavy Arctic ice       fragments of many glacial
bergs       had caught the lesser, more brittle drift-pans
of the floe against the broken base and
submerged face of Deep Water Cliff and ground
them slowly to slush in the swells. There were
six feet of this slush, perhaps       a depth of six
feet and a width of thirty.

It was as coarse as cracked ice in a freezer.[194]
It was a quicksand. Should a man's leg go
deep enough he would not be able to withdraw
it; and once fairly caught       both feet gripped       he
would inevitably drop through. It would be
a slow and horrible descent       like sinking in a
quicksand.

It was near dark. The snow       falling thicker       was
fast narrowing the circle of vision.

"I might get across," said Doctor Luke.

"You'll not try, sir," Billy Topsail declared,
positively. "You'll start back t' Candlestick
Cove."

"I might              "

"You'll not!"

There was something in Billy Topsail's
tone to make Doctor Luke lift his brows and
stare.

"What's that?" said he, smiling grimly.

"I says you'll not try."

Doctor Luke laughed uneasily.

"No?"

"No, sir."

Billy Topsail was a big boy. Doctor Luke
measured his length and breadth and power
with new interest and recalled that he had always
admired the lusty proportions of the lad.[195]
Decidedly       Billy Topsail was a big fellow!
And Billy Topsail's intentions were plain.

"Now              " the Doctor began, argumentatively.

"'Tis no use, sir. I knows you."

Doctor Luke moved off a step. "But Billy,
you see, my dear fellow              "

"No, sir!" Billy Topsail moved within reach.

"I'm quite sure              "

"No."

Doctor Luke stared at the breach of slush.
He faced away, then, abruptly. "Wel-ll," he
admitted, with a shrug, "no doubt you're right,
Billy. I              "



[196]




CHAPTER XXVI



In Which it Seems that an Axe and Terry Lute's
Finger Are Surely to Come into Injurious Contact,
and Terry Lute is Caught and Carried
Bawling to the Block, While His Mother Holds
the Pot of Tar


In Tom Lute's cottage beyond Come-Along
Point of Amen Island they were ready for
the operation. There was a thick, round
billet of birch, upended in the middle of the
kitchen floor, to serve as a block for the amputation;
and the axe was sharp, at last       at hand,
too, but concealed, for the moment, behind the
pantry door       and a pot of tar was warming on
the kitchen stove.

Sandy Lands had reported for duty, whom
nothing but a sense of duty had drawn to a hand
in the surgical assistance       a bit perturbed, as he
contemplated the task of restraining the struggles
of a violent little subject, whose temper he
knew, but sturdy and resolved, his resolution
substantiated by a sort of religious austerity.

Black Walt Anderson, a gigantic, phlegmatic
fellow, who would have subdivided into half a[197]
dozen little Terry Lutes, also awaited the signal
to pounce upon the Little Fiddler of Amen Island,
imprison his arms, confine his legs, subdue
all his little struggles, in short, bear him to the
block and flatten his hand and spread his fingers
for the severing blow.

It was to be a simple operation       a swift descent
of the axe and a quick application of hot
tar and bandages to stifle the wound. And that
was to be the end of the finger and the trouble.

There had been a good deal of trouble. Terry
Lute's sore finger was a source of brutal agony.
There had been many days of this pain       a throbbing
torture in the finger and hand and arm.
And Terry had practiced deception in an heroic
degree.

No pain (said he); but, ah, well, a twinge,
now an' again       but nothin' at all t' make a man
complain. An' sure (said he), 'twas better all
the while       improvin' every blessed minute, sir.
A day more (said he) would see the boil yield t'
mother's poultice; an' a fortnight would see un
all healed up an' the finger able for labour again.

It was in the night that Terry could conceal
the agony no longer       deep in the night, when
his mother sat beside the cot; and then he[198]
would crawl out of bed, stow his slender little
body away in his mother's arms, put his head
down and cry and moan without shame until
he had exhausted himself and fallen into a fitful
sleep.

No; it was no trifling agony for Terry Lute
to withstand. And he knew all the while, moreover,
that the cut of an axe       no more, it might
be, than a flash       would eventually relieve him.
Terry Lute was not afraid of the pain of the
thing they wanted to do. That was not the inspiration
of his infuriated rebellion.

There was nothing mistaken in the intention
of the axe. It was neither cruel nor blundering.

Amen Island lies remote: the folk do for
themselves       they are nearly sufficient to themselves,
indeed, in all the affairs of life; and when
they fail (they say) and sorrow comes of it       well,
there is failure everywhere, too, and life
leaves every man when the spirit is finished
with its habitation. "I done the best I could!"
It is epitaph honourable enough. There was no
horror on Amen Island       no furious complaint of
the wrongs of a social arrangement       when catastrophe
came through lack of uncommon means
to stave it off.

[199]

And so when Tom Lute told old Bob Likely
that when he had a job to do he was accustomed
to employ the best means at hand       he expressed
in simple terms the lesson of his habitat. This
affair of Terry Lute's finger was of gravest moment;
had the finger gangrened       it must come
off in haste, and the sooner the better; and an
axe and a pot of tar were the serviceable instruments
according to the teaching of all experience.

Doubtless doctors were better provided and
more able; but as there was no doctor to be
had, and as Terry Lute was loved and greatly
desired in the flesh, and as he was apparently in
peril of a sudden departure       and as he was in
desperate pain       and as              

But Terry Lute would not have his finger
off. From the corner, where he stood at bay,
roaring in a way to silence the very gale that
had now begun to shake the cottage, he ran to
his mother's knee, as though for better harbour.

And there he sobbed his complaint.

"Ah, Terry, lad," his father pleaded; "'tis
only a finger!"

"'Tis on my left hand!"

"You're not left-handed, son," Tom Lute[200]
argued, patiently. "You've no real need o'
four fingers there. Why, sonny, boy, once I
knowed a man              "

"'Tis one o' my fiddle fingers."

Tom Lute sighed. "Fiddle fingers, son!"
said he. "Ah, now, boy! You've said that
so often, an' so foolishly, that I              "

"I'll not have it off!"

"But              "

"Isn't no use in havin' it off," Terry complained,
"an' I can't spare it. This here
boil              "

"'Tisn't a boil, son. 'Tis mortification.
An'              "

"'Tis not mortification."

Again Tom sighed.

"Is you afeared, Terry?" said he. "Surely
you isn't a pullin' little coward, is you? A finger!
'Tis such a simple little thing t' suffer              "

"I'm not afeared neither!"

"Well, then              "

"You may cut any finger you likes off my
right hand," Terry boasted, "an' I'll not whimper
a peep."

"I don't want a finger off your right hand,
Terry."

[201]

"I won't have it!"

"'Tis no pleasure t' me t'              "

"I won't have a finger off my left hand!"

"I tells you, Terry, you isn't left-handed. I've
told you that a thousand times. What in the
name o'              "

"I tells you I won't have it!"

Black Walt Anderson looked to Tom Lute for
a signal. Sandy Lands rose.

"Now?" he seemed to inquire.

Tom Lute shook his head.

"That's the way we done aboard the Royal
Bloodhound," the Little Fiddler's grandfather put
in. He began to pace the floor. The tap-tap
of his wooden leg was furious and his voice was
as gusty as the gale outside. "Now, you mark
me!" he ran on. "We chopped Cap'n Sam
Small's foot off with a axe an' plugged it with
b'ilin' tar. 'Twas mortification. I knows mortification
when I sees it. An' Sam Small got
well."

He was bawling, by this time, like a skipper
in a gale       being deaf, the old man was accustomed
to raise his voice, a gradual crescendo,
until he had come as near hearing himself as
possible.

[202]

"Yes, sir       you mark me! That's what we
done aboard the Royal Bloodhound the year I
shipped for the seals along o' Small Sam Small.
We chopped it clean off with a meat axe an'
plugged it with b'ilin' tar. If Small Sam Small
had clung t' that member for another day he
would have died. Mark me! Small Sam Small
would have been dropped over the side o' the
Royal Bloodhound an' left t' shift for hisself in a
sack an' a Union Jack!"

He paused before Terry Lute and shook a lean
finger under the little boy's nose.

"Now," he roared, "you mark me!"

"I isn't aboard the Royal Bloodhound!"
Terry sobbed.

"Ah, Terry!" This was Terry's mother. She
was crying bitterly. "You'll die an you don't
have that finger off!"

"I'll die an I got to!"

"Oh, Terry, Terry!"

"I isn't afeared t' die."

"Ah, Terry, dear, whatever would I do              "

"I'll die afore I gives up one o' my fiddle
fingers."

"But you isn't got              "

"Never you mind about that!"

[203]

"If you had              "

"You jus' wait till I grows up!"

Again Sandy Lands inquired for the signal.
Tom Lute lifted a hand to forbid.

"Terry, son," said he, gravely, "once an' for
all, now, will you              "

"No!" Terry roared.

"Oh, oh, Terry, dear!" the mother wailed,
observing the preparations that were making
behind Terry's back. "If you'd only              "

Terry screamed in a furious passion:

"Have done, woman! I tells you I won't
have none o' my fiddle fingers cut off!"

It was the end. Tom Lute gave the signal.
Sandy Lands and Black Walt Anderson pounced
upon little Terry Lute and carried him bawling
and struggling from his mother's knee towards
the block of birch in the middle of the kitchen floor.
Tom Lute stood waiting there with the axe.

As for Terry Lute's mother, she flew to the
stove, tears streaming from her eyes, her mouth
grim, and fetched the pot of tar. And then all
at once the Little Fiddler of Amen Island wriggled
out of the clutches of his captors       they were too
tender with him       and dived under the kitchen
table.



[204]




CHAPTER XXVII

In Which Doctor Luke's Flesh Creeps, Billy Topsail
Acts Like a Bob-Cat, and the Little Fiddler
of Amen Island Tells a Secret


Confronting the slush of Deep Water
Cove, with the finger of the Little Fiddler
of Amen Island awaiting his ministration
beyond, Doctor Luke had misled the faithful Billy
Topsail into the assumption of his acquiescence.
It was not in his mind to return to Candlestick
Cove that night. It was in his mind to gain the
shore and proceed upon his professional call.
And there was reason in this. For when the
group of Arctic ice       still rhythmically swinging
in and out with the great seas from the open       drove
down upon the broken base of Deep Water
Cliff, it compressed the ice between.

At the moment of greatest compression the
slush was reasonably solid ground. When the
Arctic ice subsided with the wave, the slush expanded
in the wider space it was then permitted
to occupy. A man could cross       a light, agile
man, daring the depth of the slush, might be[205]
able to cross       when the slush was compressed.
No man could run all the way across. It must
be in two advances. Midway he would be caught
by the subsidence of the wave. From this he
must preserve himself.

And from this       from dropping through the
field of slush and having it close over his head       he
might preserve himself by means of his gaff.

"Wel-ll," Doctor Luke had admitted, apparently
resigned, "no doubt you're right, Billy.
I              "

Now the Arctic ice was poised.

"Ay, sir. An' you're more reasonable than
ever I knowed you t'              "

A sea was rolling in.

"Wel-ll," the Doctor drawled, "as I grow
older              "

Then came the moment of advantage. Doctor
Luke ran out on the slush before Billy Topsail
could reach out a hand to restrain him. It was
indiscreet. Doctor Luke had been too eager to
escape       he had started too soon; the sea was not
down       the slush was not squeezed tight. A foot
sank to the ankle. Doctor Luke jerked it out
The other foot went down to the calf of the leg.
Doctor Luke jerked it       tugged it. It was fast.[206]
The slush, in increasing compression, had caught
it. He must wait for the wave to subside.

His flesh crept with the horror of the thing. He
was trapped       caught fast! A moment later the
sea was in retreat from the cliff and the slush began
rapidly to thin. Doctor Luke employed the
stratagem that is familiar to the coast for dealing
with such ice as the slush in which he was entrapped.
He waited       alert. There would come
a moment when the consistency of the ice would
be so thin that he would drop through.

Precisely before that moment       when his feet
were first free       he dropped flat on his gaff.
Having in this way distributed his weight       avoided
its concentration on a small area       he
was borne up. And he withdrew his feet and
waited for the sea to fall in again and compress
the ice.

When the next wave fell in Billy Topsail
started across the ice like a bob-cat.

Doctor Luke lay inert through two waves.
When the third fell he jumped up and ran
towards the base of Deep Water Cliff. Again
the sea caught him unaware. His flesh was
creeping again. Horror of the stuff underfoot       the
treacherous insecurity of it       drove him. The[207]
shore was close. He was too eager for the shore       he
ran too far; and his foot went down again       foot
and leg to the thigh. As instinctively he
tried violently to extract the leg by stepping up
on the other foot       that leg went down to the knee.

A fall to the arm-pits impended       a drop clean
through and overhead. The drop would inevitably
be the result of a flash of hesitation. Doctor
Luke cried out. And as he cried he plunged
forward       a swift, conscious effort to fall prone on
his gaff. There was a blank. Nothing seemed
to happen. He was amazed to discover that the
gaff upheld him. It occurred to him, then, that
his feet were trapped       that he could not withdraw
his legs from the sucking slush.

Nor could he. They were caught. And he
perceived that they were sinking deeper       that he
was slowly slipping through the slush.

He was conscious of the night       the dark and
snow and wind; and he fancied that he heard a
voice of warning.

"Cotch hold              "

It was a voice.

"Cotch hold o' the gaff!"

Doctor Luke seized the end of Billy Topsail's
gaff and drew himself out of the grip of the[208]
slush. When the sea came in again he jumped
up and joined Billy Topsail on the broken base
of Deep Water Cliff. He was breathing hard.
He did not look back. Billy Topsail said that
they had better make haste       that somebody
would "cotch a death o' cold" if they did not
make haste. And they made haste.



An hour or more later Doctor Luke, with Billy
Topsail in his wake, thrust into Tom Lute's
agitated kitchen and interrupted the amputation
of the fiddle finger of the Little Fiddler of Amen
Island with a "Well, well, well! What in the
name of              " and stood staring       all dusted with
snow and shivering and fairly gone purple with
cold.

They had Terry Lute cornered, then       his back
against the wall, his face horrified, his mouth
wide open in a bellow of rage; and Sandy Lands
and Black Walt Anderson were almost upon him       and
Tom Lute was grimly ready with the axe
and Terry Lute's mother was standing beside
the round birch block with the pot of tar in her
hands and her apron over her head.

Doctor Luke stood staring at all this       his
mouth as wide open, because of a temporary[209]
paralysis, due to his amazement, as Terry Lute's
mouth was fallen in anger and terror. And it
was not long after that       the Doctor being warm
and dry, then, and the kitchen quiet and expectant,
and Tom Lute and Terry Lute's mother
exhibiting relief and the keenest sort of interest       that
the Doctor took Terry Lute's fiddle finger
in his hand.

Then he began to prepare the finger for the
healing thrust of a lance.

"I'm going to cure it, Terry," said he.

"That's good, sir. I'm wonderful glad t' save
that finger."

"You cherish that finger, Terry?"

"I does that, sir! I've need of it, sir."

The Doctor was not attending. His attention
was on the lance and its object. "Mm-m," he
ran on, absently, to make distracting conversation.
"You've need of it, eh?"

"'Tis one o' my fiddle fingers, sir."

"Mm-m? Ah! The Little Fiddler of Amen
Island! Well, Terry, lad, you'll be able to play
your fiddle again in a fortnight."

Terry grinned.

"No, sir," said he. "I won't be playin' my
fiddle by that time."

[210]

The Doctor looked up in astonishment.

"Yes, you will," he flashed, sharply.

"No, sir."

"But I tell you              "

"I isn't got no fiddle."

"What!"

"All I got now," said the Little Fiddler of
Amen Island, "is a jew's-harp. But jus' you
wait till I grows up!"



Billy Topsail had broken into smothered
laughter; and Doctor Luke, laughing, too, had
already determined that the Little Fiddler of
Amen Island should not have to wait until he
grew up for his first violin (which came to pass
in due course)       this hearty mirth was in progress
when there was a loud knock on the door, a
trample of feet in the entry, a draught of cold
air blowing through the open door, and Billy
Topsail had the surprise of his not uneventful
career. He stared, helpless with amazement,
incredulity, delight; and for a moment he could
do nothing more worthy of his manners than
keep on staring, as though he had clapped eyes
on a ghost.

Archie Armstrong had come in.

[211]

"Archie!" Doctor Luke exclaimed.

They shook hands. But Archie Armstrong's
eyes were not on Doctor Luke. Doctor Luke
might be met anywhere at any time. It was
not surprising to find him on Amen Island.
Archie was staring at Billy Topsail.

"Ye little lobster!" said he, at last, grinning.

"Whoop!" Billy yelled. "'Tis you!"

They flew at each other. It was like a wrestling
bout. Each in the bear-like embrace of the
other, they staggered over the floor and eventually
fell down exhausted. And then they got
up and shook hands in what Archie called "the
regular" way.



[212]




CHAPTER XXVIII



In Which Sir Archibald Armstrong's Son and
Heir is Presented for the Reader's Inspection,
Highly Complimented and Recommended by the
Author, and the Thrilling Adventure, Which
Archie and Billy are Presently to Begin, Has
its Inception on the Departure of Archie From
St. John's Aboard the "Rough and Tumble"


As everybody in St. John's knew very well
(and a good many folk of the outports,
to say nothing of a large proportion of
the sealing fleet), Archie Armstrong was the son
of Sir Archibald Armstrong, who was used to
calling himself a fish-dealer, but was, in fact, a
deal more than that. Directly or indirectly, Sir
Archibald's business interests touched every port
in Newfoundland, every cove of the Labrador,
the markets of Spain and Portugal, of the West
Indies and the South American Republics.

His fishing schooners went south to the Banks
and north to the gray, cold seas off Cape Chidley;
his whalers gave chase in the waters of the Gulf
and the Straits; his trading schooners ran from
port to port of all that rugged coast; his barques[213]
carried cod and salmon and oil to all the markets
of the world. And when the ice came down
from the north in the spring of the year, his sealing
vessels sailed from St. John's on the great
adventure.

Archie was Sir Archibald's son. There was
no doubt about that. He was a fine, hearty lad       robust,
as every young Newfoundlander should
be; straight, agile, alert, with head carried high;
merry, quick-minded, ready-tongued, fearless in
wind and high sea, as a good many adventures
with Billy Topsail had proved. His hair was
tawny, his eyes as blue as Billy Topsail's, and as
wide and as clear; and his face was broad and
good-humoured.

And (every lad has his amiable weakness)
Archie was something of a dandy in his dress       a
tailored, speckless, polished, fashionable person,
to whom the set of his trousers and the knot
in his cravat were matters of concern. All in
all, from his soles to his crown, and from his rosy
skin to the innermost recesses of his good red
heart, he was very much of a brave, kindly, self-respecting
man.

Billy Topsail liked him. That is putting it
mildly. And Archie Armstrong liked Billy Top[214]sail.
That, too, is putting it mildly. The boys
had been through some hard places together, as
I have elsewhere recorded; and they had come
through the good and the bad of their undertakings
with mutual respect and liking. Nobody
could help liking Billy Topsail       he was a courageous,
decent, jolly, friendly soul; and for the
same reasons nobody could help liking Archie
Armstrong. It was a good partnership       this
friendship between the Colonial knight's son and
heir and the outport fisherman's lad. And both
had profited.

Billy had gained in manners and knowledge
of the world, to describe the least gain that he
won; and Archie had gained in health and
courage and the wisdom of the coast. But that
was all. Rich as Archie's prospects were, and
as great the wealth and generosity of his father,
Billy Topsail had never anticipated a material
advantage; and had one been offered him, it
would not have been accepted except on terms
of a description not to wound Billy Topsail's
self-respect.

Well, what sort of an education had Archie
Armstrong had? It is best described in the incident
that sent him off on his first sealing voyage,[215]
as elsewhere set down. It was twilight of a blustering
February day. Sir Archibald Armstrong
sat alone in his office, with his chair drawn close
to the low, broad window, which overlooked the
wharves and ice-strewn harbour beyond; and
while the fire roared and the wind drove the
snow against the panes, he lost himself in profound
meditation.

He stared absently at the swarm of busy men       now
almost hidden in the dusk and storm       and
at the lights of the sealing fleet, which lay
there fitting out for the voyage to the drift-ice of
the north; but no sound of the activity on dock
or deck could disturb the quiet of the little office
where the fire blazed and crackled and the snow
fell softly against the window panes.

By and by Archie came in.

"Come, son," said Sir Archibald, presently,
"let us watch them fitting out the fleet."

They walked to the window, Sir Archibald
with his arm over Archie's shoulder; and in the
dusk outside, the wharves and warehouses and
ships told the story of the wealth of Sir Archibald's
firm.

"It will all be yours some day," said Sir
Archibald, gravely. After a pause, he contin[216]ued:
"The firm has had an honourable career
through three generations of our family. My
father gave it to me with a spotless reputation.
More than that, with the business he gave me
the faith of every man, woman and child of the
outports. The firm has dealt with its fishermen
and sealers as man with man, not as the exploiter
with the exploited. It has never wronged,
or oppressed, or despised them.

"In September you are going to an English
public school, and thence to an English University,
when the time comes. You will meet with
new ideals. The warehouses and ships, the fish
and fat, will not mean so much to you. You
will forget. It may be even       for you are something
of a dandy, you know       that you will be
ashamed to acknowledge that your father is a
dealer in fish and seal-oil; and that              "

Archie drew breath to protest.

"But I want you to remember," Sir Archibald
went on, lifting his hand. "I want you to know
a man when you meet one, whatever the clothes
he wears. The men upon whom the fortunes of
this firm are founded are true men. They are
strong, brave and true. Their work is toilsome
and perilous, and their lives are not unused to[217]
deprivation; but they are cheerful, and independent,
and fearless, through it all       stout
hearts, every one of them.

"They deserve respectful and generous treatment
at the hands of their employers. For that
reason I want you to know them more intimately       to
know them as shipmates know one another       that
you may be in sympathy with them. I
am confident that you will respect them, because
I know that you love all manly qualities. And
so for your good, and the good of the men, and
the good of the firm, I have decided that              "

"That I may go sealing?" cried Archie.

"That you may go sealing."

Archie had gone sealing. And the adventure
had made of him the man that he was.



Archie Armstrong had gone then to an English
public school, having made the acquaintance of
Billy Topsail on that first voyage, where the
friendship had been founded in peril and a narrow
escape. And he had come back unspoiled;
and he had adventured with Billy Topsail again,
and he had gone to England and returned to
Newfoundland once more. In St. John's, with
an English tutor, because of the illness of his[218]
mother, who had by that time recovered, he
pleaded with Sir Archibald to be permitted once
more to sail with the fleet.

There was objection. Archie was importunate.
Sir Archibald relented and gave a reluctant
consent. And it was determined that Archie
should be shipped with Cap'n Saul Galt, commanding
the Rough and Tumble, a stout ship,
well manned, and, in the hands of Cap'n Saul,
as safe a berth for a lad as any ship of the fleet
could provide. That Archie was delighted goes
without saying; and that he was all aflame
with interest in the movements of the ice       inquisitive
and talkative       goes without saying too.

As a matter of fact, a man might hear what he
liked on the water-front about the movements of
the ice. In the gathering places it was just the
same. There were rumours of the ice all the way
from the Straits of Belle Isle and the Labrador
coast to the Funks and Cape Bonavist'. It was
even held by some old sealing dogs that the
floes had gone to the east in a spurt of westerly
weather and would be found far to sea in the
southerly drift.

All this while old Cap'n Saul, of the Rough
and Tumble, with Archie usually at his elbow,[219]
cocked an ear and kept his counsel, putting two
and two together, and arriving at the correct
result of four, according to the old cock's habit.

"The ice is inside the Funks, Archie," said he.
"I'll twist the Rough and Tumble t' the west an'
shake off the fleet in the night. Havin' clung
with profit t' my sealin' wisdom these ten sealin'
seasons," he went on, "they'll follow me an
they're able, an' pester my fellows an' steal my
panned fat. They're all bit mad by the notion
that the ice drove t' the east with the nor'west
puff an' whisper o' wind we had. I'll fiddle their
wits this year       mark me!"

"Whisper of wind?" Archie exclaimed.
"'Twas a whole gale of wind!"

"Pt!"

"And the ice did drive to the east."

"Pt!" says Cap'n Saul. "You'll never make
a sealin' skipper, Archie. I smells the ice off
the Horse Islands."

It was foul weather all the way from St. John's
to the floes. The fleet sailed into a saucy head-wind
and a great slosh of easterly sea. It was a
fair start and no favour, all managed by the law;
the fat on the floes was for the first crews of the
fleet to find and slaughter it. And there was a[220]
mighty crowd on the water-front to wish the fleet
well; and there was a vast commotion, too       cheering
and waving and the popping of guns.

At sea it was a helter-skelter race for the ice.
Cap'n Saul touched up the Rough and Tumble
beyond St. John's Narrows; and the ship settled
to her work, in that rough and tumble of black
water, with a big white bone in her teeth       shook
her head and slapped her tail and snouted her
way along to the northeast. A whisp of fog
came with the night. It was thick weather.
But Cap'n Saul drove northeast, as before       slap
into a smothering sea; and by this the fleet, tagging
behind, was befooled and misled.

After dark, Cap'n Saul doused the lights and
switched full steam to the west; and when day
broke the Rough and Tumble was alone, come
what might of her isolation       and come it did, in
due course, being all a-brew for Cap'n Saul and
crew, even then, in the northwest.

As for the fleet, it was off on fools' business in
the bare seas to the east.



[221]




CHAPTER XXIX



In Which the Crew of the "Rough and Tumble"
is Harshly Punished, and Archie Armstrong,
Having Pulled the Wool Over the Eyes of Cap'n
Saul, Goes Over the Side to the Floe, Where
He Falls in with a Timid Lad, in Whose Company,
with Billy Topsail Along, He is Some
Day to Encounter His Most Perilous Adventure


Well, now, two days later, near dusk,
with Archie Armstrong on the bridge,
the Rough and Tumble was crawling
northwest through the first ice of the floe. An
hour of drab light was left of the day       no more.
And it was mean ice roundabout       small pans
and a naughty mess of slush. There was a hummock
or two, it might be, and a clumper or two,
as well; and a man might travel that ice well
enough, sore pinched by need to do so. But it
was foul footing for the weight of a full-grown
man, and tricky for the feet of a lad; and a man
must dance a crooked course, and caper along,
or perish       leap from a block that would tip and
sink under his feet to a pan that would bear him[222]
up until he had time and the wit to leap again,
and so come, at last, by luck and good conduct,
to a pan stout enough for pause.

It was mean ice, to be sure. Yet there was a
fine sign of seals drifting by. Here and there
was an old dog hood on a hummock; and there
and here were a harp and a whitecoat on a flat
pan. But the orders of Cap'n Saul were to
"leave the swiles be"       to "keep the mouths o'
the guns shut" until the Rough and Tumble had
run up to the herd that was coming down with
the floe.

"I'll have no swiles slaughtered in play," he
declared.

A gun popped forward. It was from the
midst of a crowd. And Cap'n Saul leaned over
the bridge-rail.

"Who done that?" he demanded.

There was no answer.

"Mm-m?" Cap'n Saul repeated. "Who done
that?"

No answer.

"A dog hood lyin' dead off the port bow!"
said Cap'n Saul. "Who killed un?"

Still no answer. And Cap'n Saul didn't ask
again. Forthwith he stopped the ship.

[223]

"Mister Knibbs, sir," said he, to the mate,
"send the crew after that dead hood."

The mate jumped.

"Cap'n Saul, sir," he replied, his eyes popping,
"the ice              "

"Sir?"

"This here ice, sir              "

"Sir?"

"This here              "

"Sir?"

"This              "

"Mister Knibbs, sir," said Cap'n Saul, dryly,
"this here ice is fit enough for any crew that I
commands. An' if the crew isn't fit for the ice,
sir, I'll soon have un so, ecod! Put un over the
side. We'll waste no swiles on this v'y'ge."

"All hands, sir?"

"All hands over the side, sir, t' fetch that dead
hood aboard."

Archie put in:

"May I go, Cap'n Saul?"

"No!"

"Cap'n Saul," Archie began to wheedle, "I'm
so wanting to              "

"No, sir."

"I'm just crazy to              "

[224]

"'Tis no fit place for you."

"But              "

Cap'n Saul changed his mind all at once. He
sent a call for Archie's old and well-tried friend,
Bill o' Burnt Bay.

"Stand by the lad," said he.

"Ay, sir."

Archie left the bridge with Bill o' Burnt Bay,
with whom he had sailed before. And over the
side they went. And over the side went the
crew for punishment. There were more than
two hundred men. And not a man was spared.
Cap'n Saul sent the ship's doctor after malingerers,
and the mate and the haft of a sealing
gaff after lurkers; and he kept them capering
and balancing for dear life on that dirty floe,
sopping and shivering, all in a perilous way,
until dusk was in the way of catching some of
them unaware.



It was then that Archie and Bill o' Burnt Bay
fell in with old Jonathan Farr of Jolly Harbour.
Bill o' Burnt Bay knew the old man well. And
he was shocked to find him cavorting over that
foul, tricky ice, with the thin blood and dry old
bones he had to serve his need       a gray old dog[225]
like Jonathan Farr of Jolly Harbour, past his
full labour these years gone by, gone stiff and all
unfit for the labour and chances of the ice.

Still, the old man was blithe enough, as Bill
marvelled to see. His eye was lit up with a
flicker of fun, sparkling, somehow, through the
rheum of age; and his words were mixed with
laughter. They came to rest on a pan       the four
of them together; old Jonathan Farr and Bill
and Archie and a little lad. And Archie marked
this in a glance       that the lad, whoever he was,
was out of heart with the work he was at.

A good deal was to flow from that meeting;
and Billy Topsail was to have a part in it all.



[226]




CHAPTER XXX



In Which a Little Song-Maker of Jolly Harbour
Enlists the Affection of the Reader


"My gran'son, Bill," said Jonathan.

Archie pitied the lad       a white,
soft-eyed little chap, all taut and
woeful with anxiety.

"He's young for the ice," Bill observed.

"A young dog," Jonathan replied, "masters
his tricks with ease."

Again Archie pitied the little fellow.

"Too young," said Bill, "for man's labour like
this."

"He'll l'arn all the better for his youth."

"Time enough," Bill insisted, "two years
hence."

"Ah, well, Bill," said Jonathan, then, "I wants
t' see my gran'son fit an' able for his labour afore
I goes my way." And he clapped the lad on the
back. "Eh, Toby?" said he, heartily.

The lad was grave and mannerly.

"Ay, gran'pa," said he; "you're wonderful
careful o' me, you is!"

[227]

"That I is, Toby!"

"Yes, siree!"

"I bet I is careful o' you!" Jonathan declared.
"An' I'll keep on bein' so. Eh, Toby?"

The lad turned to Archie.

"I'm havin' a wonderful bringin' up, sir," said
he. "My gran'pa is wonderful careful o' me.
With the wonderful bringin' up I'm havin' I
ought t' turn out a wonderful clever man."

"You will!" Archie replied.

"That ye will!" said Bill o' Burnt Bay.

"Pray God," said the lad, "I'm worthy!"

Jonathan gave the lad a little clap on the back.
Archie thought it was to thank him for the expression
of confidence. And it made the lad
squirm and grin like a patted puppie.

"What you think of un, Bill?" Jonathan inquired.

It was a wistful question. Jonathan seemed to
want a word of praise. And Bill gave it with all
his heart.

"Big as a whale!" said he.

"He've the hull of a young whale," said
Jonathan; "an' afore this v'y'ge is out he'll have
the heart of a bear."

Toby chuckled.

[228]

"Ay       maybe!" said he.

"You will!" Archie declared.

Well, now, you must know that it is not uncommon
to fall in with a timid lad on the coast:
a lad given a great deal to music and the making
of ballads, and to the telling of tales, too.
Such folk are timid when young. It is no shame.
By and by they harden to their labour, the softer
aspiration forgotten. And then they laugh at
what they used to do. I have sometimes thought
it a pity. But that's no matter now.

Bill o' Burnt Bay knew this lad       knew his
weird, sad songs, and had bellowed them in the
cabin of the Cash Down       


"Oh, the chain 'e parted,
An' the schooner drove ashore;
An' the wives of the hands
Never seed un any more       
No more:
Never seed un no mor-or-or-ore!"


It was a song weird and sad enough for a little
lad like Toby Farr to make. Before a bogie-stove
in the forecastle of a schooner at anchor,
Toby Farr could yarn of foul weather in a way
to set the flesh of a man's back creeping with
fear; but it was told of him at Jolly Harbour,[229]
and laid to the sad songs he made, that in a
pother of northeasterly weather he was no great
hand for laughter.

"'Tis Toby's first season at the ice, Bill," said
Jonathan. "Eh, Toby?"

"Ay, sir."

"An' gran'pa come along with you, didn't he,
Toby? You wanted ol' gran'pa for company,
didn't you? Eh, Toby?"

"Ay, sir."

"Isn't got no father, is you, Toby?"

"No, sir."

"Isn't got nobody but gran'pa t' fetch you up       is
you? Eh, Toby?"

"I'm content, sir."

"Hear that, Bill! He's content! An' he've
been doin' well out here over the side on the ice.
Isn't you, Toby?"

"Is I, gran'pa?" It was a flash of hope.

"Is you!"

"Ay       is I, sir?" It was eager. "Is I been
doin' well, sir       as you'd have me do?"

"That you is!"

"Is you tellin' me the truth, gran'pa? It isn't
jus' t' hearten me, is it?"

"'Tis the truth! You is doin' better, Toby,[230]
than your father done at your age. I never
knowed a lad t' do so well first time on ice like
this. An' you was all on fire t' come t' the ice,
wasn't you, Toby?"

"I wanted t' come, sir."

"An' you've not repented, Toby? Mm-m?"

"No, sir." The lad stared about and sighed.
"I'm glad I come, sir."

Jonathan turned to Archie with his face all in
a pucker of joy.

"There's spirit, sir!" he declared.

"Ay," said Archie; "that's brave enough,
God knows!"

"I been cronies with Toby, Bill," Jonathan
went on, to Bill o' Burnt Bay, "ever since he
was born. A ol' man like me plays with children.
He've nothin' else t' do. An' I'm enjoyin'
it out here at the ice with Toby. 'Tis a
pleasure for a ol' man like me t' teach the young.
An' I'm wonderful fond o' this here gran'son o'
mine. Isn't I, Toby? Eh, lad?"

"That you is, gran'pa!" the lad agreed.
"You been wonderful good t' me all my life
long."

"Hear that, Bill!" Jonathan exclaimed.

The lad was mannerly and grave.

[231]

"I wisht, sir," said he, "that my conduct
might win your praise."

And then Cap'n Saul called them aboard with
a saucy toot of the whistle, as though they had
been dawdling the day in pranks and play.



CAP'N SAUL CALLED THEM ABOARD




[232]




CHAPTER XXXI



In Which a Gale of Wind Almost Lays Hands on
the Crew of the "Rough and Tumble," Toby
Farr is Confronted With the Suggestion of
Dead Men, Piled Forward Like Cord-Wood,
and Archie Armstrong Joins Bill o' Burnt Bay
and Old Jonathan in a Roar of Laughter


Archie Armstrong and Toby Farr
made friends that night. The elder boy
was established as the patron of the
younger. Toby was aware of Archie's station       son
and heir of the great Sir Archibald Armstrong;
but being outport born and bred, Toby
was not overawed. Before it was time to turn
in he was chatting on equal terms with Archie,
just as Billy Topsail had chatted, in somewhat
similar circumstances, on Archie's first sealing
voyage.

Toby sang songs that night, too       songs
for the crew, of his own making; and he yarned
for them       tales of his own invention. It occurred
to Archie more than once that Toby
possessed a talent that should not be lost       that
something ought to be done about it, that some[233]thing
must be done about it; and Archie determined
that something should be done about it       Archie
was old enough to understand the power
of his prospective wealth and his own responsibility
with relation to it.



And that night, below, when Toby Farr was
curled up asleep, Archie learned more of this
queer matter of Jonathan and the lad. He
learned that it was in the mind of old Jonathan
Farr that he would not last long in the world       that
he was wistful to have the lad hardened
before the time of his departure fell. Proper
enough: for of all that Jonathan had to leave the
lad, which was much, when you come to think it
over, he could leave him no better fortune than a
store of courage and the will and skill to fend
for himself.

But the ice was no fit place for Jonathan Farr       a
lean, weary old dog like Jonathan Farr.
Ah, well, said he, what matter? For his time
was on the way, and the lad was heartened and
taught in his company; and as for the frost that
might bite his old flesh, and as for the winds that
might chill the marrow of his old bones, it was
nothing at all to suffer that much, said he, in the[234]
cause of his own son's son, who was timid, as his
father had been, in youth, and his father's father
before him.

"Ay," said Archie; "but the lad's too young
for the ice."

"True, Archie       he's tender," said Jonathan;
"but I've no certainty o' years. An' I done well
with his father, Archie, at his age."

"'Twould go hard with a tender lad like Toby
in time of trouble."

"No, no, Archie              "

"He'd never live it through, Jonathan."

"Ay," Jonathan replied; "but I'm here,
Archie       me! An' that's jus' what I'm here for       t'
keep un safe from harm while I teaches un t'
fend for hisself."

"You!" Bill o' Burnt Bay put in, in banter.

"I'm old       true," says Jonathan. "Yet I've a
shot left in the locker, Bill, against a time o' need."



Next day Cap'n Saul found the herds       a patch
of harps and new-whelped young. The crew
killed all that day. At dusk the men were used
to the slaughter, and could bat a seal and travel
the ice without fear or awkwardness. There was
a pretty prospect indeed of making a quick[235]
voyage of it. And this would mean a puff and
bouquet of praise for Cap'n Saul in the St.
John's newspapers, and a sixty dollar share in
the fat for every man and lad of the crew:
"Rough and Tumble, Cap'n Saul Galt, First Arrival.
In With Thirty Thousand!"       all in big,
black letters to startle folks' eyes and set the
tongues of the town clacking.

It would be news of a size to make the town
chatter for a fortnight; it would spread to the
outports; it would give Cap'n Saul all the sealing
glory of that year. There would be great stir and
wonder in Water Street when Cap'n Saul went
by; and there would be a lively gathering for
congratulations in the office of the owners when
Cap'n Saul swaggered in to report what everybody
knew, that Saul Galt, of the Rough and
Tumble, was the first of the fleet to come in with
a load.

Sir Archibald Armstrong himself would be
there to clap the skipper on the back.

"I congratulate you, Cap'n Saul!" he would
say. "I'm proud o' ye, sir!"



Driving this way and that, and squirming
along, nosing and ramming and blasting a[236]
course through the floes, the Rough and Tumble
loaded fifteen thousand seals in a week. It was
still gray weather       no wind to matter; and the
sea was flat in the lakes and lanes, and the ice
was abroad, and no great frost fell to scorch the
crew. Bill o' Burnt Bay was master of the Third
Watch       the watch of Jonathan Farr and Toby.
At dawn the First Watch filed over the side,
every man with a gaff and a tow-rope and a
biscuit or two; and all day long they killed and
sculped and towed and panned the fat       all
smothered in blood.

Meanwhile the Rough and Tumble ran away
out of sight to land the Second Watch on another
field, and beyond that, then, to land the
Third Watch; and then she made back through
the ice to stand by and pick up the First Watch.
And when she had picked up the First Watch,
and stowed away the seals, and had gathered
the Second Watch, it was dusk and after every
night, and sometimes long after, when she got
back to pick up Bill o' Burnt Bay's watch, which
was the last to leave the floe.

Thus it was labour all day and sweat most of
the night       torches on the pans where the sculped
seal lay; and torches on deck       the decks all red[237]
and slippery with blood and fat and ice. And it
looked well for them, every one       a load of fat
and the first to port with it.

Toby Farr killed and sculped and towed and
panned a lad's full share of the fat.

"Well, sir," said Archie, one day, "how you
getting along?"

"I thrives, sir," Toby replied.

"A cock so soon!" said Bill.

"My gran'pa," says Toby, "is teachin' me."

Archie laughed.

"Is you apt?" Bill inquired.

"I've learned courage," Toby replied, "an' 'tis
a hard lesson t' learn."

"God knows!" Bill agreed.

"I'll be jus' 's fit an' able 's anybody, mark
me," Toby boasted, "afore this v'y'ge is out!"

"I believe you!" said Archie.

Foul weather fell with the crews on the floe       a
brief northeast gale of cold wind. The floe
went crunching to the southwest       jumping along
with the wind like a drove of scared white rabbits.
And the pans packed; and the lakes began
to close       the lanes to close. Bill o' Burnt Bay
gathered his watch in haste. Seals? Drop the
seals! It was time for caution       quick work for[238]
crews and ship. Cap'n Saul snatched the other
watches from the ice and footed it back for Bill's
watch before the press nipped the Rough and
Tumble and caught her fast; and Bill's watch
was aboard before dusk, leaving the kill to drift
where the wind had the will to drive it.

Cap'n Saul was proud of the smart work       smelling
out a swift gale of northeasterly wind
with that old foul-weather nose of his, and picking
his crew from the ice with the loss of not a
man. It was a narrow shave, though       narrow
enough to keep a man's heart in his mouth until
he got a mug of hot tea in his stomach. And
that night there was talk of it below       yarns of
the ice: the loss of the Greenland's men in a
blizzard       poor, doomed men, cut off from the
ship and freezing to madness and death; and of
how the Greenland steamed into St. John's Harbour
with her flag at half-mast and dead men
piled forward like cord-wood.

Tales of frosty wind and sudden death       all
told in whispers to saucer eyes and open mouths.

"A sad fate, Toby!" said Jonathan, to test the
lad's courage. "Mm-m?"

Toby shrugged his shoulders.

"Yep," said he.

[239]

"All them poor dead men in a heap!"

"Sad enough, sir."

"Cast away in the cold an' all froze stiff!"

"Yep."

"Hard as stone!"

"Yep."

"An' piled for'ard like cord-wood!"

"Sad sight, sir. Yep."

"Oh, dear me!" said Jonathan.

Toby put a hand on the old man's shoulder.
It was to hearten his grandfather's courage. And
Toby smiled.

"Cheer up, gran'pa!" said he. "You isn't
afeared, is you?"

"Hear that, Bill!" cried Jonathan.

Toby whistled a tune.

"Whistlin'!" said Bill. "Yet afore this v'y'ge
is out ye may lie a blue corpse yourself on the
ice!"

And Toby yawned.

"Yep," said he.

It was a cure. Archie and Bill and Jonathan
burst into a roar of laughter. Toby was timid
no longer. He could not be frightened by tales
and gruesome suggestions to his imagination.



[240]




CHAPTER XXXII



In Which Archie Armstrong and Billy Topsail
Say Good-bye to Toby Farr for the Present,
and, Bound Down to Our Harbour with Doctor
Luke, Enter Into an Arrangement, From Which
Issues the Discovery of a Mysterious Letter and
Sixty Seconds of Cold Thrill


What happened next was the astonishing
meeting of Archie Armstrong and
Billy Topsail in Tom Lute's cottage
on Amen Island. The rising blast of wind that
threatened to interrupt Doctor Luke's passage
of Ship's Run, and thus cost Terry Lute the
"fiddle finger" he cherished, so dealt with the
floe, at sea, where the men of the Rough and
Tumble were at work, that Archie was cut off
from return to the ship. At first the adventure
wore a grave appearance; but Archie knew the
coast, and was aware, also, that the land near
which the Rough and Tumble had debarked her
crew in the morning was the land of Amen
Island.

That there was an hospitable settlement on[241]
Amen Island, Cap'n Saul had told him. It was
towards Amen Island, then, that his endeavour
was directed, when the shifting ice cut him off
from the ship and dusk caught him on the floe.
And he had no great difficulty in making the
shore. The floe, in the grip of the wind, drifted
towards the land and came in contact with it
before night fell.

Archie had a long, stumbling search for the
cottages of Amen. That was the most trying
aspect of his experience. In the end, however,
pretty well worn out, but triumphant, he caught
sight of the light in Tom Lute's cottage; and he
knocked on the door and pushed into the kitchen
just when Doctor Luke, having lanced Terry
Lute's finger, and having been informed that
Terry Lute's fiddle was a jew's-harp, had joined
Billy Topsail in the hearty laughter that the
amazing disclosure excited.

It was late then. Archie and Billy and Doctor
Luke were all feeling the effect of the physical
labour of that stormy night; and when Billy and
Archie had exchanged news in sufficient measure
to ease their curiosity, and when Doctor Luke and
Archie, who were old friends, had accomplished
the same satisfying end, and Black Walt and[242]
his assistant had departed, and when Terry Lute
and Tom Lute and Terry Lute's mother had recovered
from their delight, the simple household
turned in to sleep as best it could.

In the morning       which means almost immediately
after dawn       Archie Armstrong insisted
upon his own way. And his own way
was happy and acceptable. The Rough and
Tumble lay offshore. She was within sight
from the window of Tom Lute's cottage. Undoubtedly
Cap'n Saul had a searching party       probably
the whole crew-out after Archie Armstrong;
and undoubtedly the old man was in a
fever and fury of anxiety       a fury of anxiety because,
no great wind having blown, and the ice
having been driven against the coast, his alarm
for Archie's safety need not be great, whereas
the delay caused by Archie's misadventure would
surely arouse a furious impatience.

Consequently Archie sought to relieve both
his anxiety and his impatience; and to this end
he set out over the ice, with Billy Topsail and
Doctor Luke, to board the Rough and Tumble,
where Billy Topsail was wanting to shake the
hand of his old friend, Bill o' Burnt Bay, and
Archie was eager to have Doctor Luke "in[243]spect"
Toby Farr and his grandfather. It was
in Archie's mind to "make a man" of Toby.

"Cap'n Saul," said Archie, by and by, "will
you be sailing to the s'uth'ard?"

"A mad question!" Cap'n Saul growled.

"Yes; but, sir              "

"Isn't you got no sense at all? How can I
tell where the ice will go?"

Archie grinned.

"It wasn't very bright, sir," he admitted.
"Still, Cap'n Saul, is there any chance              "

"Why?"

"I want to go down with Doctor Luke, sir, to
Our Harbour. But I don't want to be left on the
coast until the mail-boat comes north. If you
think you might be in the neighbourhood of
Our Harbour, and could send a boat ashore for
me, sir, I'll take a chance."

"I might," Cap'n Saul replied. "An' the
way the ice sets, I think I will. Will that do
ye?"

"It will, sir!"

"If the ice goes t' sea              "

"You'll leave me. I understand that."

"I'll leave ye like a rat!"

Archie laughed.

[244]

"Billy," said he, gleefully, "I'll go south with
you!" And to Cap'n Saul: "How long will
you give me, sir?"

"I'll give you a week."

"Make it ten days, sir?"

"Archie," Cap'n Saul replied, "I thought
you was a b'y o' some sense. How can I say
a week or ten days? I'll pick you up if I can.
An' that's all I'll say. What I'm here for is
swiles. An' swiles I'll have, b'y, no matter
whether you're left on the coast or not."

Archie flushed.

"Cap'n Saul, sir," said he, "I beg pardon.
You see, sir, I       I              "

Cap'n Saul clapped him on the back.

"Archie, b'y," said he, putting an arm over
the boy's shoulder, "I'll pick you up if I can.
An' if I can't"       Cap'n Saul accomplished a
heavy wink       "there'll be some good reason
why I don't. Now, you mark me!"

Upon that understanding Archie packed a
seaman's bag and went back to Amen Island
with Doctor Luke and Billy Topsail. First,
however, he shook the hand of Bill o' Burnt
Bay, and shook the hand of Toby Farr, and
shook the hand of Jonathan Farr. And Billy[245]
Topsail shook hands with them all, too. Billy
Topsail liked the quality of Toby Farr. They
were to go through a gale of wind together       Archie
and Billy and Bill and Jonathan and
little Toby Farr. And Billy and Archie were
to learn more of the quality of Toby Farr       to
stand awed in the presence of the courage
and nobility of Jonathan Farr.



Thus it came about that Doctor Luke, Billy
Topsail and Archie Armstrong, near dusk, two
days later, drove Doctor Luke's dogs into
Bread-and-Butter Tickle, on the way south to
Doctor Luke's hospital at Our Harbour. There
was sickness near by       at Round Cove and Explosion
Bight; and as Doctor Luke was in haste,
he was in something of a quandary. Doctor
Luke's solution and immediate decision were
sufficient.

Billy Topsail was to carry medicine and directions,
especially directions, which had a good
deal to do with the virtues of fresh air, to ease
the slight trouble at Explosion Bight, and Doctor
Luke would himself attend to the serious
case at Round Cove, setting off at once and returning
before noon of the next day, all being well.

[246]

Billy's errand was the longer; it might be
two or three days before he could get back       Explosion
Bight lay beyond Poor Luck Barrens       but
at any rate a start for Our Harbour would
be made as soon as he got back. As for Archie
Armstrong, he was to kick his heels and feed the
dogs at Bread-and-Butter Tickle       a prospect that
he did not greatly enjoy, but was disposed to
make the best of. As it turned out, the issue of
the whole arrangement gave him sixty seconds
of thrill that he will never forget.

In the operation of the plan, returning from
Explosion Bight, where he had executed his
directions, dusk of a scowling day caught Billy
Topsail on the edge of the woods. And that was
a grave matter       Billy Topsail was in driven
haste. As the white wilderness day had drawn
on, from a drab dawn to a blinding noon, and
from noon to the drear, frosty approach of night,
the impression of urgency, in the mystery that
troubled him, grew large and whipped him faster.

When he loped from the timber into the
wind, high above the sea, he was dog-tired and
breathless. It was offshore weather then; a
black night threatened; it was blowing in tepid
gray gusts from the southwest; a flutter of wet[247]
snow was in the gale. In the pool of ghostly,
leaden dark, below Spear Rock, of Yellow Head,
the ice of Skeleton Arm was wrenched from the
coast; and with an accumulation of Arctic bergs
and drift-pans, blown in by the last nor'easter, it
was sluggishly moving into the black shadows of
the open sea. And having observed the catastrophe,
in a swift, sweeping flash, Billy Topsail
stopped dead on the ridge of Spear Rock, dismayed
and confounded.

To camp on Spear Rock was no incident of
his dogged intention.

Bread-and-Butter Tickle, to which a persistent,
feverish impression of urgency, divined from the
puzzling character of the incident of the night
before, had driven Billy Topsail since the drab
dawn of that day, lay across the darkening
reaches of Skeleton Arm. In the snug basin,
beyond the heads of the narrows, the lamps were
lighted in the cottages of the place. It was a
twinkling, beckoning hospitality; it invited Billy
Topsail to supper and to bed       to the conclusion
of his haste and to the relief of his mystification.

But on the Labrador coast, as elsewhere, the
longest way round is often the shortest way
home. It was two miles across Skeleton Arm to[248]
Bread-and-Butter Tickle, on a direct line from
Spear Head; it was four miles alongshore to
Rattle Water Inlet, at the head of Skeleton Arm,
and eight from Rattle Water to the lights of
Bread-and-Butter. Billy Topsail reflected upon
the discrepancy       the flurry of snow, too, and the
swift approach and thick quality of the night;
and having surveyed the ice, the fragments of
which seemed still to be sufficiently in contact for
crossing, he clambered down Spear Head to the
shore of the sea.

"Can I cross?" he wondered.

After further reflection:

"I don't know," he concluded.

What mystified Billy Topsail, and drove and
challenged him, as he had never been mystified
and driven and challenged before, was a letter.
Billy Topsail had come through the scrub timber
and barrens beyond the first wild hills of Long-Age
Inlet; and having came to the fork in the
trail from Run-By-Guess to Poor Luck Barrens,
where he was to camp for the night, he had been
confronted by a new-cut stick, stoutly upright in
the snow of the trail, and a flutter of red flannel
rag, and a letter, snapped in the cleft head of the
stick.

[249]

That the solitary wilderness of his journey
should be so concerned with the outport world
of that coast as to produce a letter was amazing;
and that the letter should present itself, in the
nick of time, where, probably, no other traveller
except the mail-man had passed since the first
snow fell, and that a fluttering flannel rag should
declare its whereabouts, as though confidently
beseeching instant conveyance to its destination,
was more stimulating to Billy Topsail's reflection
than mere amazement could be.

"Now," thought he, "what's this?"

It was darkly, vitally mysterious.

"'Tis the queerest thing ever I knowed!"

The letter was a folded brown paper, sealed
tight, doubtless with a paste of flour and water;
and it was inscribed in an illiterate scrawl:
Brednbutr       which Billy Topsail had the wit to
decipher at once. Bread-and-Butter       nobody in
particular at Bread-and-Butter; anybody at all at
Bread-and-Butter. Need was signified; haste
was besought       a letter in a cleft stick, left to do
its own errand, served by its own resources, with
a fluttering red flannel rag to arrest and entreat
the traveller.

Obviously it was intended for the mail-man.[250]
But the mail-man, old Bob Likely, with his long
round       the mail-man, where was he? Billy Topsail
did not open the letter; it was sealed       it was
an inviolate mystery. Fingering it, scrutinizing
it, in astonished curiosity, he reflected, however,
upon the coincidence of its immediate discovery       the
tracks were fresh in the snow and the brown
paper was not yet weather-stained; and so remarkable
did the coincidence appear that he was
presently obsessed with the impulse to fulfill it.

He pushed back his cap in bewilderment.

"Jus' seems t' me," he reflected, gravely, "as
if I was meant t' come along an' find this letter."

It was, truly, a moving coincidence.

"I ought t' be shot," Billy Topsail determined,
"if I doesn't get this here letter t' Bread-and-Butter
the morrow night!"



[251]




CHAPTER XXXIII



In Which the Letter is Opened, Billy and Archie
are Confronted by a Cryptogram, and, Having
Exercised Their Wits, Conclude that Somebody
is in Desperate Trouble


It was a woman's doing. The signs of a
woman were like print       little tracks in the
snow       a woman's little foot; and the snow
was brushed by a skirt. What woman? A girl?
It was a romantic suggestion. Billy Topsail was
old enough to respond to the appeal of chivalry.
A perception of romance overwhelmed him. He
was thrilled. He blushed. Reflecting, thus, his
thought tinged with the fancies of romance, his
chivalry was fully awakened. No; he would not
open the letter. It was a woman's letter. An
impulse of delicacy forbade him to intrude.
Wrong? Perhaps. Yet it was a fine impulse.
He indulged it. He stowed the letter away.
And at dawn, still in a chivalrous glow, he set
out for Bread-and-Butter Tickle, resolved to deliver
the letter that night; and he was caught by
dusk on the ridge of Spear Head, with a flurry[252]
of wet snow in the wind and the night threatening
thick.

Having come to the edge of the moving ice,
Billy Topsail looked across to the lights of
Bread-and-Butter.

"Might 's well," he decided.

Between Spear Head and Bread-and-Butter
Tickle, that night, Billy Topsail had a nip-and-tuck
time of it. It was dark. Snow intermittently
obscured his objective. The ice was fragmentary       driving
and revolving in a slow wind.
It was past midnight when he hauled down the
heads of Bread-and-Butter and knocked Archie
Armstrong out of bed.

"Archie," said he, "I found a queer thing."

Archie's sleepiness vanished.

"Queer?" he demanded, eagerly. "Something
queer? What is it?"

"'Tis a letter."

"A letter! Where is it?"

Billy related the circumstances of the discovery
of the letter. Then he said:

"'Tis a sealed letter. I wants t' show it t'
Doctor Luke."

"He's not back."

"Not back? That's queer!"

[253]

"Oh, no," said Archie, easily; "the case has
turned out to be more serious than he thought
and has detained him. Where's the letter?"

Billy gave the letter to Archie.

"Bread-and-Butter," Archie read. "No other
address. That is queer. What shall we do
about it?"

"I don't know," Billy replied. "What do you
say?"

"I say open it," said Archie, promptly.

"Would you?"

"There's nothing else to do. Open it, of
course! It is addressed to Bread-and-Butter.
Well, we're in Bread-and-Butter. Doctor Luke
isn't here. If he were, he'd open it. There is
something in this letter that somebody ought to
know at once. I'm going to open it."

"All right," Billy agreed.

Archie opened the letter and stared and
frowned and pursed his lips.

"What does it say?" said Billy.

"I can't make it out. Have a try yourself.
Here       read it if you can."

Billy was confronted by a cryptogram:



Dokr com quk pops goncras im ferd

[254]

"What do you make of it?" said Archie.

"I'm not much of a hand at readin'," Billy replied;
"but I knows that first word there or I
misses my guess."

"What is it?"

"D-o-k-r. That means what it sounds like.
It means Doctor."

Archie exclaimed.

"That's it!" said he. "And the second
word's plain. C-o-m       that's Come."

"'Doctor, come,'" said Billy.

"Right. Somebody's in trouble. Deep trouble,
too. The third word is Quick. 'Doctor, come
quick.' We're right so far. P-o-p-s. What's
that?"

"It means Father."

"Right. 'Doctor, come quick. Pop's              '
What now? 'G-o-n-c-r-a-s.' What in the
world is that? It must be a kind of sickness.
Can't you guess it, Billy?"

Billy puzzled.

"G-o-n-c-r-a-s. I don't know what it means."

"Anyhow," Archie put in, "the next word
must be I'm. Don't you think so, Billy? No?
Looks like that. Hum-m! Look here, Billy       what's
F-E-R-D? What does it sound like?"

[255]

"Sounds like feared."

"Of course it does! That's right! 'I'm afeared.'
Billy, this is a pretty serious matter. Why should
the writer of this be afraid? Eh? You think a
woman wrote the letter? Well, she's afraid of
something. And that something must be the
sort of sickness her father has. Shake your
nut, Billy. What sort of sickness could she be
afraid of?"

"G-o-n-c-r-a-s. Gon-cras."

"Gon-cras. Gon-cras. Gon-cras."

"Gone," Billy suggested.

"Crazy!" cried Archie.

"Right!" said Billy.

"We've got it!" Archie exulted. "'Doctor,
come quick. Pop's gone crazy. I'm afeared.'
That's the message. What shall we do?"

"We can't do anything now."

"How's the ice on the Arm, Billy?"

"Movin' out. A man couldn't cross now. I
barely made it."

"Will the Arm be free in the morning?"

"No; it will not. The Arm will be fit for
neither foot nor punt in the morning. T' get t'
Poor Luck Barrens a man would have t' skirt the
Arm t' Rattle Water an' cross the stream."

[256]

"We'll have to do something, Billy. We can't
leave that poor girl alone with a madman."

"We'll tell Doctor Luke              "

"Yes; but what if Doctor Luke isn't back in
the morning?"

"We'll go ourselves."

Archie started.

"Go?" he inquired, blankly. "Go where?
We don't know where this letter came from. It
isn't signed."

"Ah, well," said Billy, "somebody in Bread-and-Butter
will know. Let's turn in, Archie. If
we're t' take the trail the morrow, we must have
rest."

And they turned in.



[257]




CHAPTER XXXIV



In Which Archie and Billy Resolve Upon a Deed
of Their Own Doing, and are Challenged by
Ha-Ha Shallow of Rattle Water


Neither boy slept very much. In
Samuel Jolly's spare bed (it was called
a spare bed)       where they had tumbled
in together       they did more talking than sleeping.
And that could not be helped. It was a situation
that appealed to the imagination of two
chivalrous boys       a woman all alone on Poor
Luck Barrens with a madman. When morning
came they were up with the first peep of the
light; and they were in a nervous condition of
such a sort that neither would hesitate over a
reckless chance if it should confront them in an
attempt to help the writer of the letter of the
cleft stick.

"Who is she?" Archie demanded of Samuel
Jolly.

"Jinny Tulk, sir       Trapper George's daughter."

"How does she come to be at Poor Luck
Barrens?"

"Trapper George has a trappin' tilt there, sir.[258]
They're both from this harbour. They goes
trappin' on Poor Luck Barrens in the winter.
Jinny keeps house for her pop."

"All alone?"

"Ay, sir; there's nobody livin' near."

Archie turned to Billy.

"Look here, Billy," said he, anxiously, "we've
got to go. I can't bear it here       with that poor
girl all alone              "

"Doctor Luke              "

"We can't wait for Doctor Luke."

"That's jus' what I was goin' t' say," said
Billy. "We'll leave word for Doctor Luke that
we've gone. He can follow. An' when we gets
there, we can keep Trapper George quiet until
Doctor Luke comes."

"When shall we start?"

"Now!"



Outbound from Bread-and-Butter, fortified with
instructions, Billy Topsail and Archie Armstrong
made along the shore of Skeleton Arm, by the
long trail, and were halted before noon at Rattle
Water. The ice had gone out of Rattle Water.
At the ford the stream was deep, swift, bitter
cold       manifestly impassable; and above, beyond[259]
Serpent Bend, the water of Ha-ha Shallow, which
was the alternative crossing, was in a turmoil,
swelling and foaming over the boulders in its
wide, shallow bed.

Except where the current eddied, black, flecked
with froth, Ha-ha Shallow was not deep. A man
might cross       submerged somewhat above the
knees, no more; but in the clinging grip and tug
of the current his footing would be delicately
precarious, and the issue of a misstep, a stumble,
a lost balance, would be a desperate chance,
with the wager heavily on grim Death.

It was perilous water       the noisy, sucking white
rush of it, frothing over the boulders, and running,
icy cold, in choppy, crested waves, where
the channel was a bed of stones and gravel.
Yet the path to the tilt at Poor Luck Barrens
lay across and beyond Ha-ha Shallow of Rattle
Water.

Billy Topsail and Archie Armstrong surveyed
the rapids in a dubious silence.

"Hum!" Archie coughed.

Billy Topsail chuckled.

"You've no fancy for the passage?" he inquired.

"I have not. Have you?"

[260]

"I don't hanker for it, Archie. No, sir       not
me!"

"Can it be done?"

"No, b'y."

"No; it can't be done," Archie declared.
"You're right."

They stared at the tumultuous stream.

"Come along," said Archie, with decision, his
teeth set; "we'll try that ice below again."

Below Ha-ha Shallow, where the stream
dropped into a deep, long pool, lying between
low cliffs, fringed with the spruce of that stunted
wilderness, Rattle Water was bridged with ice.
There had been flood water in the early spring
break-up       a rush of broken ice, a jam in Black
Pool, held by the rocks of its narrow exit; and
the ice had been caught and sealed by the frosts
of a swift spell of bitter weather.

The subsidence of Rattle Water, when the ice
below Black Pool ran off with the current into
the open reaches of Skeleton Arm, had left the
jam suspended. It was a bridge from shore to
shore, lifted a little from the water; but in the
sunshine and thaw and warm rain of the subsequent
interval it had gone rotten. Its heavy collapse
was imminent.

[261]

And of this Billy Topsail and Archie had made
sure on the way up-stream from the impassable
ford to the impassable white water of Ha-ha
Shallow. The ice-bridge could not be crossed.
It awaited the last straw       a rain, a squall of
wind, another day of sunshine and melting
weather. Billy had ventured, on pussy-feet, and
had withdrawn, threatened by a crack, his hair
on end.

A second trial of the bridge had precisely the
same result. Archie cast a stone. It plumped
through.

"Soft 's cheese," said Billy.

Another stone was cast.

"Hear that, Billy?"

"Clean through, Archie."

"Yes; clean through. It's all rotten. We
can't cross. Give me a hand. I'll try it."

With a hand from Billy Topsail, Archie let
himself slip over the edge of the cliff to an anxious
footing on the ice.

He waited       expectant.

"Cautious, Archie!" Billy warned.

Nothing happened.

"Cautious!" Billy repeated. "You'll drop
through, b'y!"

[262]

Archie took one step       and dropped, crashing,
with a section of the bridge, which momentarily
floated his weight. Billy caught his hand, as
the ice disintegrated under his feet, and dragged
him ashore.

"It can't be done," said Archie.

"No, b'y; it can't."

"We'll try Ha-ha Shallow again. We've got
to get across."

A moment, however, Archie paused. A startling
possibility possessed his imagination. It
was nothing remote, nothing vague; it was real,
concrete, imminent. Standing on the brink of
the rock at the point where the ice-bridge began,
he contemplated the chances of Rattle Water.
With a crossing of Ha-ha Shallow immediately
in prospect, there was something for affrighted
reflection in the current below. And the suggestion
was vivid and ugly.

There the water was flowing black, spread
with creamy puffs of foam; and it ran swift
and deep, in strong, straight lines, as it approached
the Black Pool ice and vanished beneath.
There was a space between the ice and
the fallen current       not much: two feet, perhaps;
but it occurred to Archie, with sudden, shocking[263]
force, that two feet were too much. And the
deep, oily, adherent flow of the current, and the
space between the ice and the water, and the
cavernous shadow beneath the ice, and the
gurgle and lapping of the pool, made the flesh
of his back uneasy.

"A nasty fix," he observed.

"What's that, Archie?"

"If a man lost his feet in the current."

"He'd come down like a chip."

"He would. And he'd slip under the ice.
Watch these puffs of foam. What would happen
to a man under there, Billy?"

"He'd drown in the pool. He couldn't get out."

"Right, Billy," Archie agreed, shortly. "He'd
drown in the pool. He couldn't get out. The
current would hold him in there. Come along."

"Shall we try it, Archie?"

"We'll look it over."

"An' if we think              "

"Then we'll do it!"

Billy laughed.

"Archie," said he, "I       I       I likes you!"

"Shucks!" said Archie.

Archie walked the length of Ha-ha Shallow,
from the swift water above Black Pool to Loon[264]
Lake, and returned, still searching the rapid for
a good crossing, to a point near the Black Pool
ice, where a choppy ripple promised a shallow,
gravelled bottom. The stream was wide, shelving
slowly from the shore       it was prattling
water; but there was a fearsomely brief leeway of
distance between the stretch of choppy ripple and
the deep rush of the current as it swept into the
shadows under the Black Pool ice.

Directly below the ripple, Rattle Water narrowed
and deepened; nearing Black Pool, the
banks were steep, and above the rising gorge,
which the banks formed, and running the length
of it, the current swelled over a scattering of
slimy boulders and swirled around them. It
was a perilous place to be caught. In the
gravel-bottomed ripple, the water was too swift,
too deep, for an overbalanced boy to regain his
feet; and in the foaming, hurrying, deeper water
below, the rough drift to Black Pool was inevitable:
for the boulders were water-worn and
round, and the surface was as slippery as grease
with slime.

Having stared long enough at the alluring
stretch of choppy ripple, Archie Armstrong came
to a conclusion.



[265]




CHAPTER XXXV



In Which Billy Topsail Takes His Life in His
Hands and Ha-Ha Shallow Lays Hold of It
With the Object of Snatching It Away


"Well," said Archie, "I'll try it."

"You won't!" said Billy.

"I will!"

"You won't!"

Archie looked Billy in the eye.

"Why not?" he inquired.

"I'm goin' t' try it myself."

"You're not!"

"I am!"

Both boys burst into a laugh. It was an amiable
thing to do. And there could have been no
better preparation for the work in hand.

"Look here, Billy              " Archie began.

"No," Billy insisted; "it won't do. You haves
your way always, Archie. An' now I'm goin' t'
have my turn at it. I'll try it first. An' if I gets
across you can follow."

"You might stumble."

"I know that."

[266]

"Look here, Billy              "

"No, no, b'y! I'm goin' first. I won't make
a fool o' myself. We got t' get across this stream
if we can. An' we've got t' get on t' Poor Luck
Barrens. But I won't make a fool o' myself,
Archie. I promise you that. I'll go jus' as far
as I can. I'll go with care       jus' as far as I can.
An' if 'tis no use tryin' any more, I'll come back.
That's a promise. I'll come back. An' then              "

"Ay, Billy?"

"I'll try somewhere else."

"Billy," said Archie, "I       I       I likes you!"

"Stop your jawin'!" said Billy.

Then Archie said:

"If you fall in the current I'll pull you out,
Billy. You trust me."

Billy spoke gravely:

"You'll do no such thing."

"What!" cried Archie. "Not try to save              "

"No."

"Why, Billy," Archie protested, "you're just
plain foolish to ask me not to              "

"No," said Billy, again; "it isn't foolish. I
won't have it."

Archie said nothing.

"Now," said Billy, "I'll try my hand at it."

[267]

The gravity and untoward chances of the
attempt were not ignored. Both boys were
aware of them. A simple thing to splash into
the first shallow inches of Rattle Water and
there deliberate an advance       true enough; but
Billy Topsail was in earnest about crossing. He
would venture far and perilously before he turned
back       venture to the brink of safety, and tentatively,
definitely into the dragging grip of the
deeper current beyond. A boy who proposes to
go as far as he can is in the way of overreaching
himself. Beyond his utmost, whatever his undertaking,
lies a mocking, entreating temptation to
his courage       an inch or two more.

"Billy!" said Archie.

"Ay?"

"Do you think that if you fall in the current
I'll stand by and              "

"I hopes you will, Archie, If I loses my feet,
I goes down-stream. That's plain. No man
could catch his feet in that water. An' if I goes
all the way down-stream, I goes clean under
Black Pool ice. An' if I goes under Black Pool
ice, I can't get out, because the current will hold
me there. That's plain, too. You couldn't pull
me out o' the stream. If you could do that, I[268]
could get out alone. You'd jus' go down with
me. So you leave me go."

"Billy, I              "

"Oh, I isn't goin' t' fall anyhow, Archie. An'
if I does, I'll make a fight. If I can grab anything
on the way down; an' if I can hang in the
stream, we'll talk it over again."

"Billy              "

"That's all, Archie."

With that Billy Topsail, the pack of food on
his back (since if he won the other bank he must
have sustenance for the chances of his journey to
Poor Luck Barrens), waded into the water.



Presently Billy Topsail was ankle deep in the
stream. The water foamed to his calves. Suspense
aggravated him. He splashed on       impatient
to come to the crisis that challenged
him. It was a stony bed       loose, round, slippery
stones; and a stone turned       and Billy Topsail
tottered in the deeper suck of the current. It
was nothing to regain his balance in that shallow.
And he pushed on. But by and by       time
being relative to suspense, it seemed a long, long
time to Archie Armstrong, waiting on the snowy
bank       by and by Billy Topsail was knee deep[269]
and anxiously engaged; and mid-stream, where
the ripple was dancing down in white-capped,
choppy waves, was still proportionately far
distant.

Billy paused, then, to settle his feet. The
footing was treacherous; the water was white
to his thighs       the swift, dizzy, noisy passage
was confusing. For a new advance he halted
to make good his grip of the bottom and to
brace and balance himself against the insistent
push of the current.

Archie shouted:

"You're doing fine, Billy!"

In the bawling rush of the stream it was hard
to hear Archie. Still, Billy heard. And he
nodded       but did not dare to turn.

"Go slow," Archie called, "and you'll make it!"

Billy thought so too. He was doing well       it
seemed a reasonable expectation. And he ventured
his right foot forward and established it.
It was slow, cautious work, thrusting through
that advance, feeling over the bottom and finding
a fixed foundation; and dragging the left
foot forward, in resistance to the current, was as
slow and as difficult. A second step, accomplished
with effort; a third, achieved at greater[270]
risk; a fourth, with the hazard still more delicate       and
Billy Topsail paused again.

It was deeper. The broken waves washed his
thighs; the heavy body of the water was above
his knees; he was wet to the waist with spray;
and in the deeper water, by the law of displacement,
he had lost weight. The water tended to
lift him: the impulse was up to the surface       the
pressure down-stream. In this respect the current
was like a wrestler who lifts his opponent off
his feet before he flings him down.

And in the meantime the current tightened its
hold.



[271]




CHAPTER XXXVI



In Which Ha-Ha Shallow is Foiled, Archie Armstrong
Displays Swift Cunning, of Which He
is Well Aware, and Billy Topsail, Much to His
Surprise, and not Greatly to His Distaste, is
Kissed by a Lady of Poor Luck Barrens


Another advance of the right foot; an
increased depth of two inches; a sudden,
upward thrust of the water; a rolling
stone: Billy Topsail tottered       struggled for balance,
like a man on a tight-rope, and caught
and held it; but in the wrenching effort his pack
had shifted and disturbed his natural poise. He
faced up-stream, feet spread, body bent, arms
extended; and in this awkward posture, at a
disadvantage, he swayed dangerously, incommoded
by the pack, his legs quivering in the
current.

Deliberately, then, Billy contorted himself until
the pack slipped from his shoulder to its place
on his back; and upright again, established once
more, he dragged his left foot by inches against
the current, set it above the right, forced it into
place, and turned to face the opposite shore.[272]
He was fairly mid-stream, now. Another confident,
successful step       a moment more of cool behaviour
and intelligent procedure       and the grip
of the current would begin to fail.

All this while the tumbling water had worked
its inevitable effect. It was noisy; it ran swift;
it troubled Billy Topsail       the speed and clatter
of it. And he was now confused and dizzy.
Now, too, he was conscious of the roar of the
stream below. More clamorously, more vividly,
it asserted itself       reiterated and magnified its
suggestion of disaster. It could not be ignored.
Billy Topsail abstracted his attention. It returned
to the menace.

There it was       the roar of the stream below:
the deep, narrow rush of it, swelling over the
boulders, curling around them, plunging irresistibly
towards the Black Pool ice, and vanishing
into the stifling gloom beneath, in a swift,
black, silent stream, flecked with creamy puffs
of foam. A misstep, a false stone, a lost balance       a
man would then drift fast and helpless,
bruised by the bottom, flung against the boulders
and stunned, smothered by the water, cast into
Black Pool and left to sink in still water. It was
the logical incident of failure.

[273]

Aware of the cumulative effect of fear, conscious
of the first creeping paralysis of it, Billy
Topsail instantly determined upon the next step.
It must be taken       it must be taken at once. Already
the weakness and confusion of terror was
a crippling factor to be dealt with. He must act       venture.
He moved in haste; there was a
misstep, an incautious faith in the foothold, a
blind chance taken       and the current caught him,
lifted him, tugged at him, and he lost his feet,
flung his arms in the air, toppled over, drifted
off with the current, submerged, and was swept
like driftwood into the deep rush below.

He rose, gasped, sank       came breathless to the
surface; and self-possessed again, and fighting
for life against hope, instinctively, but yet with
determined intelligence, grasping breath when
he could and desperately seeking handhold, foothold       fighting
thus he was dragged a bruising
course through the narrowing channel towards
Black Pool and at last momentarily arrested his
drift with a failing grip of a boulder.

Archie Armstrong ran down-stream. No expedient
was in his horrified mind. The impulse
was to plunge in and rescue Billy if he could.
That was all. But the current was swifter than[274]
he; he was outstripped       stumbling along the
rocky, icy shore. When he came abreast of
Billy, who was still clinging to the rock in mid-stream,
he did plunge in; but he came at once
to a full stop, not gone a fathom into the current,
and stood staring.

Billy Topsail could not catch the bottom in the
lee of the rock. Even there the current was too
strong, the depth of water too great, the lee too
narrow, the rock too small for a wide, sufficient
backwater. Black Pool was within twenty fathoms.
Billy's clutch was breaking. In a moment
he would be torn away. Yet there was a moment       a
minute or more of opportunity. And
having assured himself of this grace, Archie
Armstrong splashed ashore, without a word or a
sign, scaled the bank and ran down-stream to
the bridge of Black Pool ice.

The bridge was rotten. It was rotten from
bank to bank. It would not bear the weight of
a man. Archie Armstrong knew it. Its fall was
imminent. It awaited the last straw       a dash of
rain, a squall of wind. The ice was thick;
there was a foot of it. And the bridge was
heavy; its attachment to the low cliffs was
slight; in a day       next day, perhaps       it would[275]
fall of its own weight, lie inert in the pool, drift
slowly away to the open reaches of Skeleton
Arm and drive to sea.

Archie Armstrong, hanging by his hands from
the edge of the low cliff, broke a great fragment
from the rock and thus reduced the stability of
the whole; and hanging from the edge of the
same low cliff, a few fathoms below, grasping
the roots of the spruce, he broke a second fragment
loose with his weight       a third and a fourth.
And the structure collapsed. It fell in thick,
spacious fragments on the quiet water of the
pool, buoyant and dry, and covered the face of
the water, held imprisoned by the rocks of the
narrow exit.

When Billy Topsail came drifting down, Archie
Armstrong, waiting on the ice, helped him out
and ashore.

"Better build a fire, Archie," said Billy, presently.

"I'm doing that very thing, Billy."

"Thanks, Archie."

"Cold, b'y?"

"I'll take no harm from the wettin'."

"Harm! A hardy kid like you! I laugh!"

Billy grinned.

[276]

"When I'm rested," said he, "I'll wring out
my clothes. By the time we've had a snack o'
soggy grub I'll be dry. An' then we'll go on."

"On it is!"

Billy looked up.

"Archie," said he, "that was marvellous       clever!"

"Clever?" inquired Archie. "What was
clever?"

And Archie Armstrong grinned. He knew
well enough what was clever.



Nobody was mad at Poor Luck Barrens.
But somebody was in a raving delirium of fever.
And that was big George Tulk       Trapper George
of Bread-and-Butter Tickle. It was a tight little
tilt on the edge of the timber       winter quarters: a
log shanty, with a turf roof, deep in a drift of
snow, to which a rising cloud of smoke attracted
the attention of Archie and Billy Topsail. No;
what was alarming at Poor Luck Barrens was
not a frenzy of insanity       it was the delirium of
pneumonia.

Jinny Tulk was glad enough to receive the
help of Billy Topsail and Archie Armstrong.

By and by Billy asked:

[277]

"Was it you put the letter in the cleft stick?"

Jinny smiled.

"Ay," said she.

"I found it," said Billy.

With that Jinny Tulk kissed Billy Topsail before
he could stop her. She was old enough for
that; and she was so wholesome and pretty that
when Billy had reflected upon the incident he
determined that he would not try to stop her
should she attempt it again.

"How'd you like it?" Archie teased him,
privately, when Doctor Luke had arrived and
Trapper George was resting.

Billy blushed.

"'Twasn't so awful," was his stout reply.

Archie burst out laughing. Billy blushed
again. Then he, too, laughed.

"I 'low I got my reward," said he.

By that time Trapper George was doing well.
Doctor Luke was watchfully at work. And
Doctor Luke and Jinny Tulk, with the help of a
spell of frosty weather and an abundance of
healing fresh air, and assisted by the determined
constitution of Trapper George Tulk himself,
who had formed the fixed habit of surviving
adverse conditions       Doctor Luke and Jinny[278]
Tulk worked an improvement, which passed
presently into a state of convalescence and ultimately
became a cure. It was no easy matter.
Trapper George Tulk put one foot over the
border       took a long look into the final shadows.
But Doctor Luke was a good fighter. And he
happened to win.



[279]




CHAPTER XXXVII



In Which Archie Armstrong Rejoins the "Rough
and Tumble," With Billy Topsail for Shipmate,
and They Seem Likely to be Left on the Floe,
While Toby Farr, With the Gale Blowing Cold
as Death and Dark Falling, Promises to Make
a Song About the Ghosts of Dead Men, but is
Entreated Not to Do So


Archie Armstrong and Billy Topsail
did not wait with Doctor Luke at
Poor Luck Barrens until the cure of
Trapper George was accomplished. In view of
Archie's wish to return to St. John's with Cap'n
Saul aboard the Rough and Tumble, it was arranged
that the boys should go back to Bread-and-Butter
Tickle alone, and thence down the
coast to Our Harbour, as best they could manage,
carrying news of Doctor Luke's detention
and the cause of it. They were sorry to say
good-bye to Doctor Luke; and Doctor Luke was
sorry to say good-bye to them. When the time
came, Billy Topsail, who had come to love and
respect the man for his warm qualities and the
work that he did, sought for words to express[280]
his feeling and his thanks; but being a simple,
robust fellow, not accustomed to the frank expression
of feeling, not used to conventional
forms, he could manage but poorly. Archie
Armstrong would have been ready, fluent, and
sincere in the same situation. But Billy Topsail
could only stutter and flush and come to an
awkward full stop.

What Billy wanted to say was clear enough
in his own mind. He had been with Doctor
Luke a good deal. They had been in tight
places together. But it was not that. "Tight
places" are only relative, after all; what is an
adventure in one quarter of the world may be a
mild incident in another. And that Billy Topsail
and Doctor Luke had been in danger together
was not particularly impressive: Billy
Topsail was used to danger       to peril of that
sort       and had grown to regard it as among the
commonplaces of life.

That aspect of his experience with Doctor
Luke to which Billy Topsail had responded
was the habit of service       the instant, willing,
efficient answer to the call of helpless need. Indeed,
Doctor Luke appeared to Billy Topsail to
be a very great man       the greatest man, in his[281]
personality and life, Billy Topsail had ever
known, not excepting Sir Archibald Armstrong.
And Billy Topsail had come definitely to the
conclusion that what he wanted to do with his
life was precisely what Doctor Luke was doing
with his.

It was this that he wanted to tell Doctor
Luke; and it was this that he failed to tell him.

"Good-bye, sir," he said.

"Good-bye, Billy."

"Th-th-thanks, sir."

"Thanks?" cried Doctor Luke. "For what,
Billy? I'm the debtor."

"Th-th-thanks, sir."

"Thank you, Billy, boy, for your most excellent
company."

And so Billy and Archie left Doctor Luke at
Poor Luck Barrens       hard at work and happy in
his work. They made Bread-and-Butter Tickle;
they travelled down the coast without incident;
they shook hands with Teddy Brisk, who was
still telling his adventures on the ice-floe, his leg
as sound as any leg; and they came safe to Our
Harbour, where they waited until Cap'n Saul
put in with the Rough and Tumble. And then
Archie would hear of nothing but Billy's com[282]pany
to St. John's       Billy must go to St. John's,
and he would go to St. John's on the Rough and
Tumble, ecod, or Archie would put him in irons
and carry him there! Billy had no sound objection.
From St. John's he could travel easily
to his home at Ruddy Cove and arrive there
long before the Labrador mail-boat would be
north on her first voyage.

And so the boys boarded the Rough and Tumble
together, fell in with Bill o' Burnt Bay, Jonathan
Farr and little Toby once more, and put to
sea. The Rough and Tumble was not loaded;
she had more seals to kill and stow away, and
Cap'n Saul was resolved to "put back loaded"       a
desirable end towards which his active crew,
in conjunction with his own sealing wisdom, was
fast approaching.

"I'll load in a week!" he boasted.

And then              



Sunday, then       and that a brooding day. It
was a dull, dragging time. Not a gaff was out,
not a gun; not a man put foot on the floe. The
Rough and Tumble killed no seals. It was not
the custom. All that day she lay made fast to
the ice, fretting for midnight. Cap'n Saul kept[283]
to his cabin. Time and quiet weather went
wasting away. Quiet weather       quiet enough
that day: a draught of westerly wind blowing,
the sky overcast and blank, and a flurry of snow
in the afternoon, which failed, before dusk, a
black, still midnight drawing on.

On the first stroke of the midnight bell, for
which he had waited since the dawn of that dull
day, Cap'n Saul popped out of the cabin, like a
jack-in-the-box, and stamped the bridge, growling
and bawling his orders, in a week-day
temper, until he had dropped the First Watch,
and was under way through the floe, a matter of
twenty miles, to land the Second Watch and the
Third       feeling a way through the lanes.

Before dawn Bill o' Burnt Bay's watch, with
Archie and Billy Topsail, was on the ice. Cap'n
Saul put back to stand by the First Watch.
Black dark yet. It was bleak on the floe! They
shivered in the frost and dark. And the light
lagged, as the light will, when it is waited for.
It was a sad dawn. A slow glower and lift of
thin, gray light: no warmth of colour in the east       no
rosy flush and glow. When day broke, at
last, the crew made into the herds, mad to be
warm, and began to kill. Still, it was done[284]
without heart. There was less blithe slaughter,
that day, than unseemly brooding and weather-gazing.
It was a queer thing, too. There was
no alarm of foul weather that any man could see.

A drear, gray day it was, day drawing near
noon. Archie and Billy always remembered
that. Yet there was no frost to touch a man's
heart, no need to cower and whine in the wind,
no snow to make a man afraid. A scowl in the
northeast       a low, drab, sulky sky, mottled with
blue-black and smoky white. They recalled it
afterwards. But that was all. And Bill o' Burnt
Bay fancied, then, with the lives of his crew in
mind, that the weather quarter was doubtless in
a temper, but no worse, and was no more than
half-minded to kick up a little pother of trouble
before day ran over the west.

And Bill was at ease about that.

"She'll bide as she is," he thought, "'til
Cap'n Saul gets back."

Bill o' Burnt Bay was wrong. It came on to
blow. The wind jumped to the northwest with
a nasty notion of misbehaviour. It was all in a
moment. A gust of wind, cold as death, went
swirling past. They chilled to the bones in it.
And then a bitter blast of weather came sweep[285]ing
down. The floe began to pack and drive.
Bill o' Burnt Bay gathered and numbered his
watch. And then they waited for the ship. No
sign. And the day turned thick. Dusk fell before
its time. It was not yet midway of the
afternoon. And the wind began to buffet and
bite. It began to snow, too. And it was a
frosty cloud of snow. It blinded       it stifled. It
was flung out of the black northwest like flour
from a shaken sack.

The men were afraid. They knew that
weather. It was a blizzard. There was a night
of mortal peril in it. There might be a night
and a day       a day and two nights. And they
knew what would happen to them if Cap'n Saul
failed to find them before the pack nipped him
and the night shut down. It had happened before
to lost crews. It would happen again.
Men gone stark mad in the wind       the floe strewn
with drifted corpses. They had heard tales.
And now they had visions. Dead men going
into port       ship's flag at half-mast, and dead men
going into port, frozen stiff and blue, and piled
forward like cord-wood.

"I'll make a song about this," said Toby Farr.

"A song!" Archie Armstrong exclaimed.

[286]

"'Tis about the gray wraiths o' dead men that
squirm in the night."

"I'd not do it!" Jonathan protested.

"They drift like snow in the black wind," said
Toby.

"Ah, no!" said Jonathan. "I'd make no
songs the night about dead men an' wraiths."

"Ay, but I'm well started              "

"No, lad!"

"I've a bit about cold fingers an' the damp
touch              "

"I'd not brood upon that."

"An it please you, sir              "

"No."

"Ah, well," Toby agreed, "I'll wait 'til I'm
cozy an' warm aboard ship."

"That's better," said Archie.

Billy Topsail shuddered. Toby's imagination       ghosts
and dead men       had frightened him.

"It is!" he declared.

CHAPTER XXXVIII



In Which the Wind Blows a Tempest, Our
Heroes are Lost on the Floe, Jonathan Farr is
Encased in Snow and Frozen Spindrift, Toby
Strangely Disappears, and an Heroic Fight for
Life is Begun, Wrapped in Bitter Dark


It is well known on this coast, from Cape Race
to Norman and the Labrador harbours,
what happened to Cap'n Saul that night.
It was vast, flat, heavy ice, thick labour for the
ship, at best       square miles of pans and fields.
In the push of the northwest gale, blowing down,
all at once, with vigour and fury, from a new
quarter, the big pans shifted and revolved. The
movement was like that of a waltz       slow dancers,
revolving in a waltz. And then the floe closed.
And what was a clear course in the morning was
packed ice before dusk.

When the day began to foul, Cap'n Saul
snatched up the First Watch, where he was
standing by, and came driving down after Bill
o' Burnt Bay's watch. It was too late. The ice
caught him. And there was no shaking free.[288]
The men on the floe glimpsed the ship       the
bulk of the ship and a cloud of smoke; but
Cap'n Saul caught no glimpse of them       a huddle
of poor men wrapped in snow and dusk.

A blast of the gale canted the Rough and
Tumble until her bare yards touched the floe
and Cap'n Saul had a hard time to save her
alive from the gale. And that was the measure
of the wind. It blew a tempest. Rescue? No
rescue. The men knew that. A rescue would
walk blind       stray and blow away like leaves.
They must wait for clear weather and dawn.

There had been Newfoundlanders in the same
hard case before. The men knew what to do.

"Keep movin'!"

"No sleep!"

"Stick t'gether!"

"Nobody lie down!"

"Fetch me a buffet, some o' you men, an I
gets sleepy."

"I gives any man leave t' beat me."

"Where's Tom Land?"

"Here I is!"

"I say, Tom       Long George gives any man
leave t' beat un black an' blue!"

And a laugh at that.

[289]

"Mind the blow-holes!"

"An a man gets wet, he'll freeze solid."

"No sleep!"

"Keep movin'!"

They kept moving to keep warm. And even
they larked. Tag, whilst they could see to chase       and
a sad leap-frog. And they wrestled and
scuffled until it was black dark and the heart
went out of them all. And then they wandered,
with no lee to shelter them       a hundred and
seventy-three men, stamping and stumbling in
the wind, clinging to life, hour after hour, and
waiting for the dawn, bitten by frost and near
stifled by snow. It was gnawing cold. Twelve
below       it was afterwards said. And that's bitter
weather. It bit through to the bones and heart.
And what they wore to withstand it       no great-coats,
to hamper the kill, but only jackets and
caps and mitts.

The floe was flat and bare to the gale. Nobody
knows the pitch of the wind. It was a full
tempest. That much is known. And it stung
and cut and strove to wrest them from their feet
and whisk them away. And there they were       in
the grip of the wind, stripped to the strength
they had, like lost beasts, and helpless to fend[290]
any more. Billy Topsail saw young Simeon Tutt,
of Whoopin' Harbour, trip and stagger and fall
at his feet; and before Billy could lay hands on
him to save him, the wind blew him away, like
a leaf, and he was never seen again, but driven
into a lake of water in the dark, it was thought,
and there perished.



LIKE LOST BEASTS


By and by Archie and Billy stumbled on old
Jonathan Farr of Jolly Harbour. It was long
past midnight then. And they saw no lad with
him. Where was Toby?

"That you, Jonathan?" said Archie.

"'Tis I, Archie."

"You living yet?"

"No choice. I got t' live."

"Where's Toby?" said Billy.

"The lad's              "

It was hard to hear. The old man's words
jumped away with the wind. And still the boys
saw no lad.

"What say?" said Billy. "I don't see Toby.
Where is he?"

"In my lee," Jonathan replied. "He's restin'."

There stood old Jonathan Farr, in the writhing
gloom of that night, stiff and still and patient as
the dead, with his back to the gale, plastered[291]
with snow and frozen spindrift, his shoulders
humped and his head drawn in like a turtle. It
was bitter dark       yet not as black as the grave.
It is never that on the floe. And the wind
streamed past, keen as a blade with frost, thick
with crisp snow, and clammy with the spray
it caught up from the open lakes and flung off
in sheets and mist.

Dead bodies lying roundabout then       the boys
had stumbled over the dead as they walked.
Young men, sprawled stiff, hard as ice to the
bones, lying stark in the drifts       Big Sam Tiller,
of Thank-the-Lord, he that whipped Paddy of
Linger Tickle, in White Bay, when the fleet was
trapped by the floe in the Year of the Small
Haul, was dead by that time; and Archie had
found little Dickie Ring, of Far-Away Cove, dead
in his elder brother's dead arms       they were pried
apart with a crowbar when the time came.

Yet there stood old Jonathan Farr, cased in
snow and ice, with the life warm in him       making
a lee for little Toby. And Toby was snuggled
up to his grandfather, his face close       sheltered
and rested from the gale, as much as might be.

Billy Topsail bent down.

"How does you?" says he.

[292]

Toby put his head out from its snug harbour,
and spoke, in a passion, as though Billy had
wronged him, and then ducked back from the
smother of wind and snow.

"My gran'pa takes care o' me!" he flashed.

"Will you save him, Jonathan?" Archie
asked.

"I've a shot in the locker, Archie," Jonathan
replied. "I'll save un alive."

Out flashed Toby's head; and he tugged at
his grandfather       and bawled up.

"Is I doin' well?" he wanted to know.

"You is!"

"Is I doin' as well as my father done at my
age?"

"You is! Is you rested?"

"Ay, sir."

"Full steam ahead!" said Jonathan. With
that they bore away       playing a game. And
Jonathan was the skipper and Toby was the
wheelman and engine. "Port!" bawled Jonathan.
And "Starboard your helm!" And
Billy and Archie lost sight of them in the dark.



[293]




CHAPTER XXXIX



In Which One Hundred and Seventy-Three Men
of the "Rough and Tumble" are Plunged in
the Gravest Peril of the Coast, Wandering
Like Lost Beasts, and Some Drop Dead, and
Some are Drowned, and Some Kill Themselves
to be Done With the Torture They Can
Bear No Longer


They kept close, a hundred and seventy-three
living men, to start with, and then
God knew how many!       kept close for
comfort and safety; and they walked warily,
drunk and stupid in the wind, in dread of lakes
and blow-holes and fissures of water, and in living
fear of crusts of snow, wind-cast over pitfalls.
And they died fast in the dark. In Archie Armstrong's
tortured mind childish visions of hell
were revived       the swish and sad complaint of
doomed souls, winging round and round and
round in a frozen dark. It was like that, he
thought.

Dawn delayed. It was night forever; and the
dark was peopled       the throng stirred, and was
not visible; and from the black wraiths of men,[294]
moving roundabout, never still, all driven round
and round by the torture of the night, came cries
of pain       sobbing and wailing, rage and prayer,
and screams for help, for God's sake.

Many of the men wore out before dawn and
were fordone: hands frozen, feet frozen, lips
and throat frozen       heart frozen. And many a
man dropped in his tracks, limp and spiritless as
rags, and lay still, every man in his own drift of
snow; and his soul sped away as though glad
to be gone. Brothers, some, and fathers and
sons       the one beating the other with frozen
hands, and calling to him to rouse and stand up
lest he die.

Dawn came. It was just a slow, dirty dusk.
And day was no better than dusk. Still they
walked blind and tortured in a frosty smother
and driving whirlwind of snow. Hands frozen,
feet frozen       and the cold creeping in upon the
heart! They were numb and worn and sleepy.
And there was no rest for them. To pause was
to come into living peril       to rest was to sleep;
and to sleep was death. Once more, then, when
day was full broken, Archie and Billy came on
Jonathan Farr and Toby.

The old man was sheathed in snow and frozen[295]
spindrift. A hairy old codger he was       icicles
of his own frozen breath clinging to his long
white beard and icicles hanging from his bushy
brows. And he was beating Toby without
mercy: for the lad would fall down, worn out,
and whimper and squirm; and the old man
would jerk and cuff him to his feet, and drive
him on with cuffs from behind, stumbling and
whimpering and bawling.

It was a sad task that he had, done in pity       thus
to cuff the little lad awake and keep him
moving; and Billy Topsail fancied that it was
waste pain. It seemed to him that the lad must
die in the gale, soon or late       no doubt about
that, with stout men yielding to death roundabout.
Billy thought that it would be better to
let him sleep and die and suffer no more.

"I'm s' sleepy!" Toby complained to his
grandfather. "Leave me sleep!"

"Get up!"

"Ah, jus' a minute, gran'pa!"

"Get up!"

"You c'n wake me 's easy              "

"Get up!"

"Ye hurt me, gran'pa!"

"Drive on!"

[296]

"You leave me alone!" Toby bawled, angrily.
"Ye hurt!"

"Drive on!"

By this time the men had been more than
twenty-four hours on the ice. And they had no
food. Hungry? No. They were cold. No
man famished in that gale. And they had yet
a night of that gale to win through, though they
knew nothing about that at the time. They began
to stray wide. And they began to go blind.
And some men fell in the water and were
drowned. Billy Topsail saw John Temple, of
Heart's Island, drop through a crust of snow
and go down for good and all; and he saw Tom
Crutch, of Seldom-Come-By, stumble over the
edge of a pan, and heard him screech for help.
They hauled him out       two men of his own
harbour; and he was frozen solid in half an
hour.

Some men chose an end of torture and leaped
into the water and killed themselves. And as
day drew on, others began to go mad. It was
horrible       like a madhouse. They babbled, stark
mad       the harbours they came from, and their
mothers, their wives, their babies. And they
had visions, and were deluded       some saw a[297]
blaze of fire and set out to find the glow, and
called to the others, as they went off, to come
and be warm. And one saw the ship's lights,
as in clear, dark weather, and staggered away,
bawling that he was coming, with a troop of
poor madmen in his wake.

This is the naked truth about that gale.



[298]




CHAPTER XL



In Which Toby Farr Falls in the Water, and, Being
Soaked to the Skin, Will Freeze Solid in
Half an Hour, in the Frosty Dusk of the Approaching
Night, Unless a Shift of Dry Clothes
is Found, a Necessity Which Sends Jonathan
Farr and Billy Topsail Hunting for Dead Men


Through all this black confusion and
bitter hardship Billy Topsail and Archie
Armstrong wandered with the others of
the men of the Rough and Tumble. They suffered,
despaired, hoped, despaired again       but
fought desperately for their lives as partners.
When Archie wanted to give way to his overwhelming
desire for sleep, Billy cuffed and beat
him into wakefulness and renewed courage; and
when Billy, worn out and numb with cold, entertained
the despair that assaulted him, Archie
gathered his faculties and encouraged him.
Had either been alone on the floe, it is probable
that he would have perished; but both together,
devoted to each other, resolved to help
each other, each watchful of the other, each in[299]spired
by the other's need       fighting thus as
partners in peril, they were as well off, in point
of vitality and determination, as any man on
the floe. Afraid? Yes, they were afraid       that
is to say, each perceived the peril he was in,
knew that his life hung in the balance, and
wished with all his might to live; but neither
boy whimpered in a cowardly way.

Coming on dusk of that day, the boys fell in
for the last time with old Jonathan Farr. Jonathan
had Toby by the scruff of the neck and was
just setting him on his feet by a broken crust of
snow. Toby was wide awake then. And he was
dripping wet to the waist       near to the armpits.
And he was frightened.

"I falled in," said he. "I       I stumbled."

In that wind and frost it was death. The lad
was doomed. And it was but a matter of minutes.

"Is you       is you wet through, Toby?" Jonathan
asked, blankly.

"I is, sir."

Jonathan drew off a mitt and felt of the lad's
clothes from his calves to his waist.

"Wet through!" said he. "Oh, dear me!"

"I'm soppin' t' the skin."

[300]

"Jus' drippin' wet!"

"I'm near froze," Toby complained. And he
chilled. And his teeth clicked. "I wisht I had
a shift o' clothes," said he.

"I wisht you had!" said Jonathan.

Billy Topsail got to windward of Jonathan to
speak his mind in the old man's ear. It seemed
to Billy that Toby's case was hopeless. The lad
would freeze. There was no help for it. And
the sooner his suffering was over       the better.

"Let un die," Billy pleaded.

Jonathan shook his head and flashed at Billy.
Yet Billy had spoken kindness and plain wisdom.
But Jonathan was in a rage with him. Billy
heard his icicles rattle. And Jonathan glared in
wrath through the white fringe of his brows.

"Go to!" he exclaimed.

"My pants is froze stiff!" said Toby in amazement.
"That's comical! I can't move me
legs." And then he whimpered with pain and
misery and fear. "I'll freeze stiff!" said he.
"I'll die!"

It was coming fast.

"You can't save un," Billy insisted, in Jonathan's
ear. "He'll freeze afore dark. Let un go."

"I'll never give up," Jonathan protested.

[301]

"I'm awful mis'able, gran'pa," said Toby.
"What'll I do now?"

"Ah, have mercy!" Billy begged. "Let un
slip away quick an' be gone."

Jonathan peered around.

"Mus' be some dead men, Billy," said he,
"lyin' around here somewheres."

Dead men enough in the drifts!

"More than a hundred," said Archie. "I
counted a hundred and nine through the
day."

"I'll find one," said Jonathan.

"No time, Jonathan."

"They're lyin' handy. I fell over Jack Brace
somewheres near here."

"Night's closin'," said Billy.

"No time t' lose," Jonathan agreed.

"Speed then!" Billy exclaimed. "He'll freeze
fast afore you find one."

"Guard the lad," said Jonathan. "I'll not be
long. Try his temper. He'll fight if you tease
un."

With that, then, old Jonathan Farr ran off to
dig a dead man from the drifts. The boys could
not see him in the snow. All this while the wind
was biting and pushing and choking them still[302]       the
snow was mixed with the first dusk.
Toby was shivering then       cowering from the
wind, head down. And he was dull. His head
nodded. He swayed in the wind       caught his
feet; and he jerked himself awake       and nodded
and swayed again. Billy Topsail thought it a
pity and a wrong to rouse him. Yet both boys
turned to keep him warm.

Toby must have the life kept in him, they
thought, until his grandfather got back. And
they cuffed him and teased him until his temper
was hot, poor lad, and he fought them in a passion       stumbling
at them, hampered by his
frozen clothes, and striking at them with his stiff
arms and icy fists.

Jonathan came then.

"I can't find no dead men," he panted. It
was hard for him to breast the wind. He was
gasping with haste and fear. "I've hunted,"
said he, "an' I can't find no dead men."

"They're lyin' thick hereabouts," said Billy.

"They're all covered up. I can't find un."

"Did you kick the drifts?" Archie asked.
"We've strayed wide," said Jonathan. "I
can't find no dead men. An' I can't walk well
no more."

[303]

"Watch the lad," said Billy. "I'll try my
hand."

Toby was lying down. Jonathan caught him
up from the ice and held him in his arms.

"Quick!" he cried. "He've fell asleep. Ah,
he's freezin'!"

It was coming dark fast. There was no time
to waste in the gale that was blowing. The
frost was putting Toby to sleep. Billy sped.
He searched the drifts like a dog for a dead man.
And soon he had luck. He found Long Jerry
Cuff, of Providence Arm, a chunk of ice, poor
man!       lying in a cuddle, arms folded and knees
drawn up, like a child snuggled in bed. Long
Jerry had been in the water, soaked to the skin,
and he was solid and useless. And then Billy
came on a face and a fur cap in a drift of snow.
It was George Hunt, of Bullet Bight, with whom
Billy had once sailed, in fishing weather, to
Thumb-and-Finger of the Labrador.

Long Jerry was lying flat on his back with his
arms flung out and his legs spread. And he was
frozen fast to the floe. Billy could not budge
him. No. Billy caught him by the head and
lifted       he was stiff as a plank; and Billy failed.
And Billy took him by the foot and pried a leg[304]
loose       and ripped at it with all his might; and
again he failed. Solid as stone! They must all
have been solid like that. And then Billy knew
that it was no use to try any more       that they
could not strip the clothes from a dead man if
they had a dead man to strip.

And then he went disconsolate to Jonathan.



[305]




CHAPTER XLI



In Which a Dead Man is Made to Order for Little
Toby Farr


"Couldn't you find none?" cried Jonathan.

"Yes."

"Where is he?"

"No use, Jonathan. He's froze fast t' the ice.
I couldn't budge un."

"We'll all              "

Billy shook his head.

"No use, Jonathan," he said again. "He's
hard as stone. We couldn't strip un."

Jonathan said nothing to that. He was in a
muse. Presently he looked up.

Then he said:

"It don't matter."

"How's Toby?" Billy asked.

Toby was on his feet.

"I'm all right," he answered for himself.
"Isn't I doin' pretty well for me,
gran'pa?"

"You is!"

[306]

Billy took Jonathan aside. Jonathan was at
ease. Billy marvelled. It was queer.

"I've warmed un up again," said Jonathan.
"Archie an' me done well. We've got un quite
warm."

"Too bad," said Billy. "He've got t' die."

"No," said Jonathan. "I've a shot in the
locker, Billy. I've found a way. Heed me,
Billy. An' mark well what I says. I 'low a dead
man's clothes would be cold an' damp anyhow.
The lad needs a shift o' warm clothes. An' I'm
warm, Billy. An' my underclothes is dry. I
been warm an' dry all day long, an' wonderful
strong an' wakeful, too, with the fear o' losin'
Toby. I'll jus' go away a little piece an' lie
down an' die. I'm tired an' dull. It won't take
long. An' you an' Archie will strip me, Billy,
while I'm still warm."

"It might do."

"'Tis the only sensible thing t' do."

It was the only thing to do. Billy Topsail
knew that. If Toby Farr's life were to be saved,
he must have dry clothes at once. Billy did not
offer to strip himself for Toby. It would have
been mock heroics. Nor did Archie Armstrong
when he learned of what Jonathan was to do.[307]
Either boy would have risked his life in a moment
to save the life of Toby Farr       without a
second thought, an instant of hesitation, whatever
the risk. Obviously it was the duty of old
Jonathan Farr to make the only sacrifice that
could save the boy. Had Archie or Billy volunteered,
the old man would have thanked them
and declined the gift.

As old Jonathan had said, to die was the only
sensible thing to do.

"Nothin' else t' do," said Billy.

"No; nothin' else t' do that I can think of
right now."

"'Tis hard for you, Jonathan," said Billy.

"Oh, no!" Jonathan replied. "I don't
mind."

"Then make haste," Billy advised. "If 'tis t'
be done, it must be done quick."

"Don't waste no heat," said Jonathan. "Fetch
Toby alongside, jus' as soon as I'm gone, an'
strip me afore I'm cold."

"Ay," Billy agreed. "That's a good idea."

"An' you keep Toby alive, somehow, Billy,"
Jonathan went on. "God help you!"

"I will."

Jonathan moved away.

[308]

"Watch where I goes," said he. "Don't lose
me. I won't be far."

And then Toby, whom Archie had in hand,
keeping him moving, spoke in alarm:

"Where you goin', gran'pa?" he demanded.

Jonathan stopped dead. He turned. And he
made back towards Toby. And then he stopped
dead again.

"I'm jus' goin' t' look for something," said he.

"What you goin' t' look for?"

"I'm goin' t' find a shift o' warm clothes for
you."

"A dead man, gran'pa?"

"Ay; a dead man."

"Don't be long," said Toby. "I'll miss you."

"I'm glad o' that," Jonathan replied.

"You might get lost in the snow," said Toby.
"Hurry up. I'll wait here with Billy an' Archie."

"I'll be back jus' as quick as I'm able," Jonathan
promised. "You wait here, Toby, an'
mind Billy and Archie, won't you, while I'm
gone?"

"Ay, sir. An' I'll keep movin' jus' the same
as if you was here. Hurry up."

By and by, when Billy thought it was time, he
went to where Jonathan was lying.

[309]

"Is you dead?" he whispered.

"Not yet," said Jonathan. "Come back in a
few minutes."

Pretty soon Billy went back.

"Is you dead?" he asked.

"Not yet," said Jonathan. "I'm makin' poor
work of it."

And Billy went once more.

"Is you dead?"

"I'm goin' fast."

And yet again:

"Is you dead?"

And Jonathan was dead.



It was worth doing. It saved Toby Farr alive
from that gale. It was no easy thing to clothe
him anew in the wind       the little boy weeping
for his dead grandfather and wanting to lie
down and die by his side. Newfoundland born,
however, and used to weather, he lived through
the night. And when Cap'n Saul gathered the
dead from the ice in the quiet weather of the
next morning, the lad was carried aboard and
stowed away, frost-bitten in a sad way, yet
bound to hang on to life.

Toby said never a word about his grandfather[310]
then. Nor did he weep any more. Nor did he
ask Billy and Archie any questions. But he
brooded. And the boys wondered what he was
thinking so deeply about. And then they put
into port       flag at half-mast and a hundred and
twenty-one men piled forward like cord-wood.
And Toby Farr came on deck, clad in his
grandfather's clothes, and watched the dead go
ashore, with Archie and Billy and Sir Archibald,
until his grandfather went by, wrapped in a
Union Jack.

"Billy!" said he.

"Ay, Toby?"

"Did my gran'pa gimme his clothes?"

"He did."

"I'll be worthy!" said Toby.

And he has grown up since then. And he is
worthy.



[311]




CHAPTER XLII



In Which the Tale Comes to a Good End: Archie
and Billy Make Ready for Dinner, Toby Farr
is Taken for Good and All by Sir Archibald,
and Billy Topsail, Having Been Declared
Wrong by Archie's Father, Takes the Path
That Leads to a New Shingle, After Which
the Author Asks a Small Favour of the Reader


Well, now, we have come to the end of
the tale of Billy Topsail. I need not
describe the grief of the Colony when
the tragedy of the ice-floes was disclosed. Newfoundlanders
are warm-hearted folk; they are
easily touched to sympathy       they grieved, indeed,
even to the remotest harbours, when news
of the death of the men of the Rough and Tumble
was spread forth. It was a catastrophe that impended
every sealing season       rare, perhaps, in
its degree, but forever a thing to be expected.
Yet you are not to think of Newfoundland in
visions wholly of wind and snow and ice. Newfoundland
is not an Arctic country by any means.
Nor does the wind blow all the while; nor is the
sea all the while in a turmoil. It is a lovely coast[312]
after all; and the folk who live there are simple,
self-respecting, cheerful       a lovable, admirable
folk. To be sure they have summer weather.
What is written in this book is of the spring of the
year       the tempestuous season, with the ice breaking
up. As a matter of fact, Newfoundland seems
to me, in retrospect, to be far less a land of tempest
and frost than of sunlit hills and a rippling blue sea.

Ashore, at last, and making ready for dinner,
in Sir Archibald Armstrong's great house, while
Archie's mother mothered little Toby Farr, who
was to live in the great house thereafter, and be
reared by Sir Archibald, like a brother of Archie's
own       alone in Archie's rooms, Billy and Archie
talked a little while.

"Somehow, Archie," said Billy, with a puzzled
frown, "it didn't seem nothin' much t' do at the
time."

"What, Billy?"

"What Jonathan done."

"No," Archie agreed.

"Somehow," Billy went on, "it jus' seemed
as if everybody was dyin', or goin' t' die, an'
one more wouldn't make no very great difference.
Didn't it seem that way t' you, Archie?"

"Just that way, Billy."

[313]

"Queer, isn't it?"

"I didn't care very much, Billy, what happened
to me."

"Nor I what happened t' me."

"Sometimes I wanted to die. I just wanted
to lie down and              "

"Me too, Archie."

"Looking back, though, it isn't the same.
I'm glad I'm alive."

There was a silence.

"Archie," said Billy, "that was a pretty fine
thing that Jonathan done."

"It was, Billy."

"An' the way he done it was fine. It was a
man's way t' do a thing like that. No fuss
about it. Jus' a quiet way       jus' goin' ahead
an' doin' what he thought he ought t' do, an'
sayin' nothin' about it."

"That was the best of it, Billy."

"It was a great thing, Archie. I can't get
over it. I thinks of it again an' again an' again.
I'd like t' be big enough t' do a thing like that
in jus' that way."

"And I, Billy."

"I bet you, Archie, Jonathan was glad t' be
able t' do it."

[314]

"I think he was."

"Yes," Billy repeated; "a big thing like that
in a big way like that. I'd like t' be man enough.
An' I knows only one other man in the world
who could do it       in jus' that quiet way."

"Who's that, Billy?"

"Doctor Luke."

"Yes," Archie agreed; "he's big enough for
anything."

"I'd like t' be like he!" Billy sighed.

Then the boys went down to dinner. Archie
had something in mind of which Billy Topsail
was not aware.



After dinner, Toby Farr was put to bed. He
was a soft little fellow, perhaps, and Archie's
mother, too, was tender. At any rate, she was
calling Toby "Son" by that time; and Toby
didn't mind, and Archie was delighted, and Sir
Archibald was smiling as though he enjoyed it.
Toby was not happy       not by any means; no
prospect of luxury, no new love, could ease the
wish for his grandfather's voice and presence.
Yet he was as happy as he very well could be       and
as safe as any lad ever was. When he said
good-night, he said it gravely, in the mannerly[315]
way he had       a courteous voice, a serious air, a
little bow. Sir Archibald smiled, and Archie
clapped him on the back, and Archie's mother
put her arms around the lad, smiling, too, and
led him off to stow him away.

Archie and Billy were then left alone with Sir
Archibald.

"Dad," Archie began, "Billy and I have been
talking."

"Well, well!" said Sir Archibald.

Billy chuckled.

"I mean really talking, dad."

"What about, son?"

"Well, quite a number of things."

"You surprise me!" said Sir Archibald.

Archie ignored the banter.

"Look here, dad," he said, "I want Billy to do
something that he won't do."

"Then," said Sir Archibald, "I should recommend
you to ask him to do something else."

"But that won't do."

"Must he do this thing?"

"If it's right."

"Is it right?"

"I think so."

"What is it?"

[316]

Archie explained the matter in dispute, with
all its provisions for guarding Billy Topsail's
self-respect, and Sir Archibald listened.

"I agree with you," said Sir Archibald,
promptly, when Archie came to the end. "I
think it right."



And that is how Billy Topsail found a proper
way to study medicine       that is how it came
about that a new shingle declares to the world
of the north Newfoundland Coast the whereabouts
of       



William Topsail, M. D.

You may find Billy Topsail in the surgery
(when he happens to be at home) if you land
from the mail-boat and follow the road over
Tinkle-Tinkle Hill to Broad Cove       a hearty,
smiling, rather quiet chap, of a scientific turn,
who goes where he is called, and has the reputation
of being the most promising physician and
surgeon in Newfoundland. He has been advised
to go to St. John's, of course; but that he will
not do       for reasons of his own, which have to do
with the obligations of service. Well, then, there
he is       in the surgery, when he is at home; and[317]
if you should happen to go ashore from the mail-boat,
and if you should take Tinkle-Tinkle Road
to Broad Cove, and if your seeking eye should
alight upon a new shingle, inscribed William
Topsail, M. D., and if you should knock on the
door, and if a stalwart, fine-looking, rather quiet
chap, with a twinkling smile, should open the
door, and if you should tell him that you know
me, and that I had invited you to call       

He'll laugh. And he'll say:

"Come in! Glad t' see you!"

And you go in       don't fail to. You'll have a
good time. And give Billy my compliments and
tell him I'll be up to see him one of these summers.
Thanks. I'm much obliged.

set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
