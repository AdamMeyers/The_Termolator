throughout New England to whom the author
has had the pleasure of reciting it. Frequent requests
that he would place it in shape for preservation
have emboldened him to issue it in its present
dress. Painfully conscious of its defects as a literary
work, he sends it forth in search of old acquaintances,
trusting it may receive a share of that kindly favor
bestowed upon it as it fell from his lips.</p>

<div class="poetry">

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">In the loftiest room, of princely state,</div>
<div class="verse">Of a modern palace grand and great,&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Whose marble front is a symbol true</div>
<div class="verse">Of the inner splendors hid from view,&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">On an autumn night, when wild without</div>
<div class="verse">The bold winds held their revel rout,</div>
<div class="verse">Rudely assailing the passing throng,</div>
<div class="verse">Through churchyards creeping with mournful song,</div>
<div class="verse">A group was gathered around a board</div>
<div class="verse">Heaped with all that wealth could afford,</div>
<div class="verse">Or taste could suggest: dishes costly and rare,</div>
<div class="verse">Fruits of all climes and all seasons, were there.</div>
<div class="verse">The pendent lights in brilliance danced</div>
<div class="verse">On the gleaming plate their rays enhanced;</div>
<div class="verse">The massive mirrors thrice displayed</div>
<div class="verse">The stately banquet there arrayed.</div>
<div class="verse">Furniture carved by an artist hand,</div>
<div class="verse">Carpets which only great wealth could command,</div>
<div class="verse">Curtains of damask, of lace, and of gold,</div>
<div class="verse">Spoke of the splendors wealth could unfold,</div>
<div class="verse">And filled with a joy and a pleasure rare</div>
<div class="verse">The youthful hearts that were gathered there.</div>
<div class="verse">Slender each form, and fair each face,</div>
<div class="verse">Of the twelve gay lads which that table grace,</div>
<div class="verse">As with genial talk and pleasant jest</div>
<div class="verse">They banter each other, and cheer their guest.</div>
<div class="verse">For one guest is there, as youthful as they,</div>
<div class="verse">With a heart as light, and a voice as gay,</div>
<div class="verse">Who laughs at their jests with ready glee,</div>
<div class="verse">And whose quick returns speak a spirit free,</div>
<div class="verse">An honored guest; for, on the morrow,</div>
<div class="verse">They must part with him in pain and sorrow.</div>
<div class="verse">The glittering emblems his shoulders bear</div>
<div class="verse">Bid him for strife and for peril prepare;</div>
<div class="verse">Bid him go forth at his Country&rsquo;s call,</div>
<div class="verse">With her banner to triumph, or on it to fall.</div>
<div class="verse">A moment&rsquo;s pause, as with ready hand</div>
<div class="verse">The waiter hurries, at command,</div>
<div class="verse">To clear the table, and, instead</div>
<div class="verse">Of the rich, choice viands thickly spread,</div>
<div class="verse">Ranges dark bottles and cruses, which show</div>
<div class="verse">Marks of long years in damp vaults below.</div>
<div class="verse">The richest juices age can display</div>
<div class="verse">Are quickly spread in tempting array.</div>
<div class="verse">Wines of Bordeaux and Seville are there,</div>
<div class="verse">With liquors and cordials sparkling and rare;</div>
<div class="verse">And bottles are opened, and glasses are filled.</div>
<div class="verse">When all in a moment the tumult is stilled,</div>
<div class="verse">As he who presides with dignified grace</div>
<div class="verse">High raises his goblet, and stands in his place:&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">&ldquo;I give you, friends, no warrior&rsquo;s name</div>
<div class="verse">Your hearts to thrill, your blood to flame;</div>
<div class="verse">No toast to beauty shall my lips repeat,</div>
<div class="verse">Where we to-night in sacred friendship meet</div>
<div class="verse">To part with one, who, in our boyhood&rsquo;s days,</div>
<div class="verse">Earnest and true, won all our love and praise;</div>
<div class="verse">Who, on the morrow, plays the hero&rsquo;s part,</div>
<div class="verse">And seeks the battle with a loyal heart.</div>
<div class="verse">His health I give with an earnest prayer,</div>
<div class="verse">That, while on his mission of peril and care,</div>
<div class="verse">Success may be his, and, by deeds renowned,</div>
<div class="verse">He may meet us again with laurels crowned.&rdquo;</div>
<div class="verse">All glasses are raised, when a gentle hand</div>
<div class="verse">Is heard at the door&mdash;all silent stand</div>
<div class="verse">As it slowly opens, and into the light</div>
<div class="verse">An old man steps, his features bright:</div>
<div class="verse">The long white hairs o&rsquo;er his shoulders stream;</div>
<div class="verse">Like silver threads in the warm rays beam.</div>
<div class="verse">Wrinkled his brow, and pale his face,</div>
<div class="verse">Wasted his form, and tottering his pace,</div>
<div class="verse">Shrunken his cheek; but the eye above</div>
<div class="verse">Tells of gentleness, kindliness, love.</div>
<div class="verse">And silent stand all as he slowly seeks</div>
<div class="verse">A place near the table, and gently speaks:&mdash;</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">&ldquo;Young men, but a moment I check your mirth,</div>
<div class="verse">And bring you back to the common earth.</div>
<div class="verse">Unbidden I come with an old man&rsquo;s prayer:</div>
<div class="verse">May it seek your hearts, and gain entrance there!</div>
<div class="verse">Look on my face, seamed, not with crime,</div>
<div class="verse">But with marks of age before their time:</div>
<div class="verse">These long white hairs should not have shown</div>
<div class="verse">Till ten more years had by me flown.</div>
<div class="verse">Age is upon me; not age by years,</div>
<div class="verse">But age by sorrow and care and tears;</div>
<div class="verse">Not age that cheers as it draweth near</div>
<div class="verse">Yon heaven which seemeth more bright and clear,</div>
<div class="verse">But age which causes the heart to lag</div>
<div class="verse">In its onward course, and the spirit to flag;</div>
<div class="verse">That prays for death as but a release</div>
<div class="verse">From earthly care, and finds no peace</div>
<div class="verse">In that sweet belief that at last I hail,&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">&lsquo;There is rest for the weary beyond the vale.&rsquo;</div>
<div class="verse">For to me has come a spirit of light,</div>
<div class="verse">Bringing the morning, and chasing the night;</div>
<div class="verse">Causing my heart with joy to swell</div>
<div class="verse">To my Maker, &lsquo;who doeth all things well.&rsquo;</div>
<div class="verse">You shall hear my story: &rsquo;twill not be long,</div>
<div class="verse">And may guard you all from sin and from wrong.</div>
<div class="verse">I had wealth and plenty in goodly lands,</div>
<div class="verse">In houses and cattle; and from my hands</div>
<div class="verse">Many were fed; and many were they</div>
<div class="verse">Who partook of my charity day by day.</div>
<div class="verse">My house was open to stranger and friend;</div>
<div class="verse">And my gold did I lavishly, freely spend.</div>
<div class="verse">But one bitter curse did my wealth uprear</div>
<div class="verse">To poison my life,&mdash;the tempter here,</div>
<div class="verse">The sparkling demon, which now I see</div>
<div class="verse">From all your glasses glaring on me,&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">A monster who steals on its prey so slow,</div>
<div class="verse">That it has your life before you know</div>
<div class="verse">Or dream of its power: this was the curse</div>
<div class="verse">That sat at my fire-side, robbed my purse,</div>
<div class="verse">Poisoned my life, and left me to be</div>
<div class="verse">A drifting log on the world&rsquo;s wide sea,</div>
<div class="verse">Ruined and bankrupt, lost and bereft;</div>
<div class="verse">No kindred, no fortune, no treasure, left.</div>
<div class="verse">Treasure!&mdash;yes; for I had three sons,</div>
<div class="verse">The hope of my life,&mdash;three noble ones.</div>
<div class="verse">You shall hear their fate, and then I&rsquo;ll away,</div>
<div class="verse">Nor longer your hour of pleasure delay.</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">One sought as a merchant hopeful to clear</div>
<div class="verse">Our tarnished name, to again uprear</div>
<div class="verse">Our shattered house; but, sad to say,</div>
<div class="verse">The curse of the wine-cup was in his way.</div>
<div class="verse">He seized on it madly, drank deep and fast,</div>
<div class="verse">And sank to the drunkard&rsquo;s grave at last.</div>
<div class="verse">I stood by his side as with frenzy wild</div>
<div class="verse">He cursed himself and his wife and child;</div>
<div class="verse">He cursed me too, as the one who had led</div>
<div class="verse">His feet in the path that drunkards tread;</div>
<div class="verse">And then&mdash;it was worse than all beside&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">He cursed his Maker; and then&mdash;he died!</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Another, with spirit that loved to brave,</div>
<div class="verse">Sought a bold, free life on the ocean-wave.</div>
<div class="verse">He left my side full of life and health,</div>
<div class="verse">In a good stanch ship, in search of wealth.</div>
<div class="verse">A twelvemonth passed, and day by day</div>
<div class="verse">I scanned for his sail the distant bay.</div>
<div class="verse">At last I saw it, and eagerly flew</div>
<div class="verse">To welcome my boy so manly and true.</div>
<div class="verse">But, alas! he was gone: no son to greet</div>
<div class="verse">My waiting heart came with eager feet.</div>
<div class="verse">But they told me there,&mdash;one stormy night,</div>
<div class="verse">When the heavens were filled with angry light,</div>
<div class="verse">The waves rolled high, and the winds beat wild,</div>
<div class="verse">That out on a frail yard went my child;</div>
<div class="verse">He had drunk deep, and &rsquo;twas fearful to sweep</div>
<div class="verse">On that slender spar o&rsquo;er the seething deep;</div>
<div class="verse">That one heavy sea tossed the ship like a toy,</div>
<div class="verse">And hurled from his hold my darling boy.</div>
<div class="verse">Then I sank me down in agony wild,</div>
<div class="verse">And glared on the waves that rolled over my child:</div>
<div class="verse">I gazed until in the waters blue</div>
<div class="verse">I saw reflected the brilliant hue</div>
<div class="verse">Of one lone star, which, high above,</div>
<div class="verse">Seemed to speak to my heart of faith and love;</div>
<div class="verse">And I thought, as I turned my eyes to its light.</div>
<div class="verse">It beckoned me on to the heavens so bright,</div>
<div class="verse">Where I know, whenever this life shall cease,</div>
<div class="verse">I shall meet my boy in eternal peace.</div>

<div class="verse">I had but one left; and him I taught</div>
<div class="verse">To shun each sinful word and thought;</div>
<div class="verse">To beware of the wine-cup&rsquo;s demon lure,</div>
<div class="verse">That would steel his heart, and his soul obscure.</div>
<div class="verse">He took the way of life that leads</div>
<div class="verse">To the sacred desk where the preacher pleads,</div>
<div class="verse">And placed his foot on the pulpit stair,</div>
<div class="verse">The gospel&mdash;banner of life&mdash;to bear.</div>
<div class="verse">When the cannon&rsquo;s boom o&rsquo;er Sumter broke,</div>
<div class="verse">And the air was filled with traitorous smoke;</div>
<div class="verse">When brave men sprang with willing hearts</div>
<div class="verse">To their Country&rsquo;s flag to repel the darts</div>
<div class="verse">Which treason had hurled with malice wild</div>
<div class="verse">At the life of the mother, so good and mild,&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">My boy stepped down from the preacher&rsquo;s stand,</div>
<div class="verse">And started forth, with life in hand,</div>
<div class="verse">To sell it dear, but to battle strong</div>
<div class="verse">With the loyal North against fearful wrong.</div>
<div class="verse">I know that he carries a magic spell</div>
<div class="verse">&rsquo;Gainst the curse of our race to guard him well;</div>
<div class="verse">And I know, should he fall, his death will be</div>
<div class="verse">In the foremost ranks of loyalty.</div>
<div class="verse">And now, young men, an old man&rsquo;s prayer:&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Leave the bright wine in your glasses there;</div>
<div class="verse">Shun its allurements; for in its deep red</div>
<div class="verse">Is the blood of its victims dying and dead.</div>
<div class="verse">Fill up your glasses, and pledge your friend</div>
<div class="verse">In the crystal stream that Heaven doth send.&rdquo;</div>

<div class="verse">With a lowly bow, and the same meek air,</div>

<div class="verse">With downcast eyes, and cheeks that burn.</div>
<div class="verse">Silent he stands as his glass he takes,</div>
<div class="verse">When the guest of the evening the silence breaks.</div>
<div class="verse">&ldquo;Friends of my boyhood, the old man&rsquo;s prayer</div>
<div class="verse">Shall meet a response in the heart I wear.</div>
<div class="verse">I come to-night from a mother&rsquo;s side:</div>
<div class="verse">She watches my life with a parent&rsquo;s pride;</div>
<div class="verse">And I know &rsquo;tis the dearest wish of her heart,</div>
<div class="verse">In camp and in battle to keep me apart</div>
<div class="verse">From sin and temptation; unceasing will pray</div>
<div class="verse">Heaven&rsquo;s blessing to guard on my perilous way.</div>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
