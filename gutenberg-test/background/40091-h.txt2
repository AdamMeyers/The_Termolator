THE SOLUTION OF THE PYRAMID PROBLEM.


With the firm conviction that the Pyramids of Egypt
were built and employed, among other purposes, for
one special, main, and important purpose of the greatest
utility and convenience, I find it necessary before I
can establish the theory I advance, to endeavor to determine
the proportions and measures of one of the
principal groups. I take that of Gïzeh as being the
one affording most data, and as being probably one of
the most important groups.

I shall first try to set forth the results of my investigations
into the peculiarities of construction of the
Gïzeh Group, and afterwards show how the Pyramids
were applied to the national work for which I believe
they were designed.


§ 1. THE GROUND PLAN OF THE GIZEH GROUP.

I find that the Pyramid Cheops is situated on the
acute angle of a right-angled triangle       sometimes called
the Pythagorean, or Egyptian triangle       of which base,
perpendicular, and hypotenuse are to each other as 3,
4, and 5. The Pyramid called Mycerinus, is situate on[Pg 10]
the greater angle of this triangle, and the base of the
triangle, measuring three, is a line due east from Mycerinus,
and joining perpendicular at a point due south of
Cheops. (See Figure 1.)



Fig. 1.

I find that the Pyramid Cheops is also situate at the
acute angle of a right-angled triangle more beautiful
than the so-called triangle of Pythagoras, because more
practically useful. I have named it the 20, 21, 29 triangle.
Base, perpendicular, and hypotenuse are to each
other as twenty, twenty-one, and twenty-nine.

The Pyramid Cephren is situate on the greater angle
of this triangle, and base and perpendicular are as before
described in the Pythagorean triangle upon which
Mycerinus is built. (See Fig. 2.)








Fig. 2. Fig. 3

Figure 3 represents the combination,       A being
Cheops, F Cephren, and D Mycerinus.

Lines DC, CA, and AD are to each other as 3, 4,[Pg 11]
and 5; and lines FB, BA, and AF are to each other as
20, 21, and 29.

The line CB is to BA, as 8 to 7; the line FH is
to DH, as 96 to 55; and the line FB is to BC, as 5 to 6.

The Ratios of the first triangle multiplied by forty-five,
of the second multiplied by four, and the other
three sets by twelve, one, and sixteen respectively, produce
the following connected lengths in natural numbers
for all the lines.

Figure 4 connects another pyramid of the group       it
is the one to the southward and eastward of Cheops.[Pg 12]

In this connection, A Y Z A is a 3, 4, 5 triangle, and
B Y Z O B is a square.




 Lines YA to CAare as       1 to 5
 CY to YZ as       3 to 1
 FO to ZO as       8 to 3
 and DA to AZ as15 to 4.


I may also point out on the same plan that calling
the line FA radius, and the lines BA and FB sine and
co-sine, then is YA equal in length to versed sine of
angle AFB.

This connects the 20, 21, 29 triangle FAB with the
3, 4, 5 triangle AZY.

I have not sufficient data at my disposal to enable
me to connect the remaining eleven small pyramids
to my satisfaction, and I consider the four are sufficient for
my purpose.

The above connected natural numbers multiplied by eight become



 R.B. cubits. R.B.C.
 (Thus, BY        48 × 8 =        384.
        GX 144 × 8 = 1152).
[Pg 15]


§ 2. THE ORIGINAL CUBIT MEASURE OF THE GIZEH GROUP.

Mr. J. J. Wild, in his letter to Lord Brougham written
in 1850, called the base of Cephren seven seconds.
I estimate the base of Cephren to be just seven thirtieths
of the line DA. The line DA is therefore thirty
seconds of the Earth's Polar circumference. The line
DA is therefore 3033·118625 British feet, and the base
of Cephren 707·727 British feet.

I applied a variety of Cubits but found none to work
in without fractions on the beautiful set of natural dimensions
which I had worked out for my plan. (See
table of connected natural numbers.)

I ultimately arrived at a cubit as the ancient measure
which I have called the R.B. cubit, because it closely
resembles the Royal Babylonian Cubit of ·5131 metre,
or 1·683399 British feet. The difference is 1/600 of a foot.

I arrived at the R.B. cubit in the following manner.

Taking the polar axis of the earth at five hundred million
geometric inches, thirty seconds of the circumference
will be 36361·02608       geometric inches, or 36397·4235
British inches, at nine hundred and ninety-nine to the
thousand       and 3030·0855 geometric feet, or 3033·118625
British feet. Now dividing a second into sixty parts, there
are 1800 R.B. cubits in the line DA; and the line DA
being thirty seconds, measures 36397·4235 British inches,
which divided by 1800 makes one of my cubits 20·2207908
British inches, or 1·685066 British feet. Similarly,[Pg 16]
36361·02608 geometric inches divided by 1800 makes
my cubit 20·20057 geometric inches in length. I have
therefore defined this cubit as follows:       One R.B.
cubit is equal to 20.2006 geo. inches, 20·2208 Brit.
inches, and 1·685 Brit. feet.

I now construct the following table of measures.

Thus there are seventy-seven million, seven hundred
and sixty thousand R.B. cubits, or two hundred and sixteen
thousand stadia, to the Polar circumference of the
earth.

Thus we have obtained a perfect set of natural and
convenient measures which fits the plan, and fits the
circumference of the earth.

And I claim for the R.B. cubit that it is the most
perfect ancient measure yet discovered, being the measure
of the plan of the Pyramids of Gïzeh.

The same forgotten wisdom which divided the circle
into three hundred and sixty degrees, the degree[Pg 17]
into sixty minutes, and the minute into sixty seconds,
subdivided those seconds, for earth measurements, into
the sixty parts represented by sixty R.B. cubits.

We are aware that thirds and fourths were used in
ancient astronomical calculations.



The reader will now observe that the cubit measures
of the main Pythagorean triangle of the plan are
obtained by multiplying the original 3, 4 and 5 by 360;
and that the entire dimensions are obtained in R.B. cubits
by multiplying the last column of connected natural
numbers in the table by eight,       thus

According to Cassini, a degree was 600 stadia, a
minute 10 stadia; and a modern Italian mile, in the
year 1723, was equal to one and a quarter ancient Roman
miles; and one and a quarter ancient Roman miles
were equal to ten stadia or one minute. (Cassini, Traite[Pg 18]

Dufeu also made a stadium the six hundredth part
of a degree. He made the degree 110827·68 metres,
which multiplied by 3·280841 gives 363607·996+ British
feet; and 363607·996+ divided by 600 equals 606·013327
feet to his stadium.

I make the stadium 606·62376 British feet.

There being 360 cubits to a stadium, Dufeu's stadium
divided by 360, gives 1·6833 British feet, which is the
exact measure given for a Royal Babylonian Cubit, if
reduced to metres, viz.: 0·5131 of a metre, and therefore
probably the origin of the measure called the Royal
Babylonian cubit. According to this measure, the Gïzeh
plan would be about 1/1011 smaller than if measured by
R.B. cubits.[Pg 19]


§ 3. THE EXACT MEASURE OF THE BASES OF THE PYRAMIDS.

A stadium being 360 R.B. cubits, or six seconds       and
a plethron 60 R.B. cubits, or one second, the base
of the Pyramid Cephren is seven plethra, or a stadium
and a plethron, equal to seven seconds, or four hundred
and twenty R.B. cubits.

Mycerinus' base is acknowledged to be half the base
of Cephren.

Piazzi Smyth makes the base of the Pyramid Cheops
9131·05 pyramid (or geometric) inches, which divided
by 20·2006 gives 452·01 R.B. cubits. I call it 452
cubits, and accept it as the measure which exactly fits
the plan.

I have not sufficient data to determine the exact base
of the other and smaller pyramid which I have marked
on my plan.

The bases, then, of Mycerinus, Cephren, and Cheops,
are 210, 420 and 452 cubits, respectively.

But in plan the bases should be reduced to one level.
I have therefore drawn my plan, or horizontal section,
at the level or plane of the base of Cephren, at which
level or plane the bases or horizontal sections of the
pyramids are       Mycerinus, 218 cubits, Cephren, 420
cubits, and Cheops, 420 cubits. I shall show how I
arrive at this by-and-by, and shall also show that the
horizontal section of Cheops, corresponding to the horizontal
section of Cephren at the level of Cephren's base,[Pg 20]
occurs, as it should do, at the level of one of the courses
of masonry, viz.       the top of the tenth course.


§ 4. THE SLOPES, RATIOS, AND ANGLES OF THE THREE PRINCIPAL PYRAMIDS OF THE
GIZEH GROUP.

Before entering on the description of the exact slopes
and angles of the three principal pyramids, I must
premise that I was guided to my conclusions by making
full use of the combined evolutions of the two wonderful
right-angled triangles, 3, 4, 5, and 20, 21, 29, which seem
to run through the whole design as a sort of dominant.

From the first I was firmly convinced that in such
skilful workmanship some very simple and easily applied
templates must have been employed, and so it turned
out. Builders do not mark a dimension on a plan which
they cannot measure, nor have a hidden measure of any
importance without some clear outer way of establishing
it.

This made me "go straight" for the slant ratios.
When the Pyramids were cased from top to bottom
with polished marble, there were only two feasible
measures, the bases and the apothems;[1] and for that
reason I conjectured that these would be the definite
plan ratios.

[1]
The "Apothem is a perpendicular from the vertex of a
pyramid on a side of the base."       Chambers' Practical Mathematics,
p. 156.



Figures 6, 7 and 8 show the exact slope ratios of
Cheops, Cephren, and Mycerinus, measured as shown[Pg 21]
on the diagrams       viz., Cheops, 21 to 34, Cephren, 20
to 33, and Mycerinus, 20 to 32       that is, half base to
apothem.





Fig. 6 Cheops.


Note. The Ratios of Bases to Altitudes are very nearly as follows, viz:       
 Cheops33 to 21or 330 to 210
 Cephren 32 to 21  or 320 to 210
Mycerīnus32 to 20  or 336 to 210



Fig. 7 Cephren.



Fig. 8 Mycerīnus.



The ratios of base to altitude are, Cheops, 33 to 21,
Cephren, 32 to 21, and Mycerinus, 32 to 20: not exactly,
but near enough for all practical purposes. For the
sake of comparison, it will be well to call these ratios
330 to 210, 320 to 210, and 336 to 210, respectively.







Fig. 9. Cheops.




Fig. 10. Cheops.



Figures 9 and 10 are meridional and diagonal sections,[Pg 22]
showing ratios of Cheops, viz., half base to
apothem, 21 to 34 exactly; half base to altitude, 5½
to 7 nearly, and 183 to 233, nearer still (being the ratio
of Piazzi Smyth). The ratio of Sir F. James, half diagonal
10 to altitude 9 is also very nearly correct.

My altitude for Cheops is 484·887 British feet, and
the half base 380·81 British feet.

The ratio of 7 to 5½ gives 484·66, and the ratio of
233 to 183 gives 484·85 for the altitude.

My half diagonal is 538·5465, and ratio 10 to 9,
gives 484·69 British feet for the altitude.

I have mentioned the above to show how very nearly
these ratios agree with my exact ratio of 21 to 34 half
base to apothem.

Fig. 12. Cephren.




Figures 11 and 12 show the ratios of Cephren, viz.,
half base to apothem, 20 to 33 exactly, and half base,
altitude, and apothem respectively, as 80, 105, and 132,
very nearly.

Also half diagonal, altitude, and edge, practically as
431, 400, and 588.[Pg 23]







Fig. 13. Mycerīnus.



Fig. 14. Mycerīnus.





Figures 13 and 14 show the ratios of Mycerinus, viz.,
half base to apothem, 20 to 32 exactly, and half base,
altitude, and apothem respectively, as 20, 25, and 32
very nearly.

Also full diagonal to edge as 297 to 198, nearly. A
peculiarity of this pyramid is, that base is to altitude as
apothem is to half base. Thus, 40 : 25 :: 32 : 20; that
is, half base is a fourth proportional to base, apothem,
and altitude.

[Pg 25]

In Cheops, my dimensions agree with Piazzi Smyth       in
the base of Cephren, with Vyse and Perring       in
the height of Cephren, with Sir Gardner Wilkinson,
nearly       in the base of Mycerinus, they agree with the
usually accepted measures, and in the height of Mycerinus,
they exceed Jas. J. Wild's measure, by not quite
one of my cubits.

In my angles I agree very nearly with Piazzi Smyth,
for Cheops, and with Agnew, for Cephren, differing
about half a degree from Agnew, for Mycerinus, who
took this pyramid to represent the same relation of Π
that P. Smyth ascribes to Cheops (viz.: 51° 51′ 14·″3),
while he gave Cheops about the same angle which I ascribe
to Mycerinus.

I shall now show how I make Cephren and Cheops
of equal bases of 420 R.B. cubits at the same level,
viz.       that of Cephren's base.

John James Wild made the bases of Cheops, Cephren,
and Mycerinus, respectively, 80, 100, and 104·90 cubits
above some point that he called Nile Level.

His cubit was, I believe, the Memphis, or Nilometric
cubit       but at any rate, he made the base of Cephren
412 of them.

I therefore divided the recognized base of Cephren       viz.,
707·75 British feet       by 412, and got a result of
1·7178 British feet for his cubit. Therefore, his measures
multiplied by 1·7178 and divided by 1·685 will
turn his cubits into R.B. cubits.

I thus make Cheops, Cephren, and Mycerinus, respectively,[Pg 26]
81·56, 101·93, and 106·93 R.B. cubits above
the datum that J. J. Wild calls Nile Level. According
to Bonwick's "Facts and Fancies," p. 31, high water
Nile would be 138½ ft. below base of Cheops (or 82·19
R.B. cubits).

Piazzi Smyth makes the pavement of Cheops 1752
British inches (or 86·64 R.B. cubits) above average
Nile Level, but, by scaling his map, his high Nile Level
appears to agree nearly with Wild.

It is the relative levels of the Pyramids, however,
that I require, no matter how much above Nile
Level.

Cephren's base of 420 cubits being 101·93 cubits,
and Cheops' base of 452 cubits being 81·56 cubits above
Wild's datum, the difference in level of their bases
is, 20·37 cubits.

The ratio of base to altitude of Cheops being 330
to 210, therefore 20·37 cubits divided by 210 and multiplied
by 330 equals 32 cubits; and 452 cubits minus
32 cubits, equals 420.

Similarly, the base of Mycerinus is 5 cubits above
the base of Cephren, and the ratio of base to altitude
32 to 20; therefore, 5 cubits divided by 20 and multiplied
by 32 equals 8 cubits to be added to the 210
cubit base of Mycerinus, making it 218 cubits in
breadth at the level of Cephren's base.

Thus, a horizontal section or plan at the level of
Cephren's base would meet the slopes of the Pyramids
so that they would on plan appear as squares with sides[Pg 27]
equal to 218, 420, and 420 R.B. cubits, for Mycerinus,
Cephren, and Cheops, respectively.

Piazzi Smyth makes the top of the tenth course of
Cheops 414 pyramid inches above the pavement; and
414 divided by 20·2006 equals 20·49 R.B. cubits.

But I have already proved that Cheops' 420 cubit
base measure occurs at a level of 20·37 cubits above
pavement; therefore is this level the level of the top of
the tenth course, for the difference is only 0·12 R.B.
cubits, or 2½ inches.



I wish here to note as a matter of interest, but not
as affecting my theory, the following measures of Piazzi
Smyth, turned into R.B. cubits, viz.:       



 PYR. INCHES.R.B. CUBITS.

 King's Chamber, "True First Height,"       230·389=       11·40
 King's Chamber, "True Breadth,"       206·066=       10·20

He makes the present summit platform of Cheops
5445 pyramid inches above pavement. My calculation
of 269·80 R.B. cub. (See Fig. 21) is equal to 5450
pyramid inches       this is about 18 cubits below the
theoretical apex.



Figure 21 represents the comparative levels and
dimensions of Mycerinus, Cephren, and Cheops.[Pg 28]

The following peculiarities are noticeable:       That
Cheops and Cephren are of equal bases at the level of
Cephren's base;       that, at the level of Cheops' base, the
latter is only half a cubit larger;       that, from the level
of Mycerinus' base, Cheops is just double the height
of Mycerinus;       and that from the level of Cephren's
base, Cephren is just double the height of Mycerinus;
measuring in the latter case, however, only up to the
level platform at the summit of Cephren, which is said
to be about eight feet wide.

The present summit of Cephren is 23·07 cubits
above the present summit of Cheops, and the completed
apex of Cephren would be 8·21 cubits above the
completed apex of Cheops.

In the summit platforms I have been guided by
P. Smyth's estimate of height deficient, 363 pyr. inches,
for Cheops, and I have taken 8 feet base for Cephren's
summit platform.


§ 6. GEOMETRICAL PECULIARITIES OF THE PYRAMIDS.

In any pyramid, the apothem is to half the base as
the area of the four sides is to the area of the base.




 Thus       Ratio apothem to half base Mycerinus 32 to 20
 Thus       Ratio apothem to half base Cephren 33 to 20
 Thus       Ratio apothem to half base Cheops 34 to 21





 AREA OF THE FOUR SIDES. AREA OF THE BASE.
 Mycerinus       70560·       44100
 Cephren291060·176400
 Cheops330777·90204304

All in R.B. cubits.

[Pg 29]




 Therefore       32 : 20 : :       70560·:       44100
 33: 20 : :291060· :176400
 34: 21: : 330777·90 :204304


[2]Herodotus states that "the area of each of the four
faces of Cheops was equal to the area of a square
whose base was the altitude of a Pyramid;" or, in
other words, that altitude was a mean proportional to
apothem and half base; thus       area of one face equals
the fourth of 330777·90 or 82694·475 R.B. cubits, and the
square root of 82694·475 is 287·56. But the correct
altitude is 287·77, so the error is 0·21, or 4¼ British
inches. I have therefore the authority of Herodotus to
support the theory which I shall subsequently set forth,
that this pyramid was the exponent of lines divided in
mean and extreme ratio.

By taking the dimensions of the Pyramid from what
I may call its working level, that is, the level of the base
of Cephren, this peculiarity shows more clearly, as also
others to which I shall refer. Thus       base of Cheops at
working level, 420 cubits, and apothem 340 cubits;
base area is, therefore, 176400 cubits, and area of one
face is (420 cubits, multiplied by half apothem, or 170
cubits) 71400 cubits. Now the square root of 71400
would give altitude, or side of square equal to altitude,
267·207784 cubits: but the real altitude is √(340²-210²)
= √71500 = 267·394839. So that the error of Herodotus's
proposition is the difference between √714 and
√715.

[2]
Proctor is responsible for this statement, as I am quoting from an essay of his in the Gentleman's Magazine. R. B.

This leads to a consideration of the properties of[Pg 30]
the angle formed by the ratio apothem 34 to half base
21, peculiar to the pyramid Cheops. (See Figure 22.)



Fig. 22.
Diagram illustrating relations of ratios of the pyramid Cheops.


Calling apothem 34, radius; and half base 21, sine       I
find that       




 Radius is the square root of 1156
 Sine441
 Co-sine715
 Tangent 713
 Secant 1869
and Co-versed-sine 169


So it follows that the area of one of the faces, 714, is a
mean between the square of the altitude or co-sine, 715,
and the square of the tangent, 713.

Thus the reader will notice that the peculiarities of[Pg 31]
the Pyramid Cheops lie in the regular relations of the
squares of its various lines; while the peculiarities of
the other two pyramids lie in the relations of the lines
themselves.

Mycerinus and Cephren, born, as one may say, of
those two noble triangles 3, 4, 5, and 20, 21, 29, exhibit
in their lineal developments ratios so nearly perfect
that, for all practical purposes, they may be called
correct.




 Thus       Mycerinus, [3]20²+25²= 1025, and 32²= 1024.
 and Cephren, [4]80²+105²= 17425,and132²= 17424.
 or [5]400²+431²= 345761,and 588²= 345744.

See diagrams, Figures 11 to 14 inclusive.

In the Pyramid Cheops, altitude is very nearly a
mean proportional between apothem and half base.
Apothem being 34, and half base 21, then altitude
would be √(34²-21²) = √715 = 26·7394839, and       

21 : 26·7394839 :: 26·7394839 : 34, nearly.

Here, of course, the same difference comes in as occurred
in considering the assumption of Herodotus, viz.,
the difference between √715 and √714; because if the
altitude were √714, then would it be exactly a mean
proportional between the half base and the apothem;
(thus, 21 : 26·72077 :: 26·72077 :: 34.)

[3] Half base to altitude.

[4] Half base to altitude.

[5] Half diagonal of base to altitude.
[Pg 32]
In Cheops, the ratios of apothem, half base and
edge are, 34, 21, and 40, very nearly, thus, 34² + 21² = 1597,
and 40² = 1600.

The dimensions of Cheops (from the level of the
base of Cephren) to be what Piazzi Smyth calls a Π
pyramid, would be       




 Half base210 R.B. cubits.
 Altitude267·380304,      c. "
 Apothem339·988573,      c. "

Altitude being to perimeter of base, as radius of a circle
to circumference.

My dimensions of the pyramid therefore in which       




 Half base=210 R.B. cubits.
 Altitude=267·394839      c. "
 Apothem=340 "

come about as near to the ratio of Π as it is possible to
come, and provide simple lines and templates to the
workmen in constructing the building; and I entertain
no doubt that on the simple lines and templates that
my ratios provide, were these three pyramids built.


§ 6A. THE CASING STONES OF THE PYRAMIDS.

Figures 23, 24, and 25, represent ordinary casing stones
of the three pyramids, and Figures 26, 27, and 28,
represent angle or quoin casing stones of the same.

The casing stone of Cheops, found by Colonel
Vyse, is represented in Bonwick's "Pyramid Facts and
Fancies," page 16, as measuring four feet three inches at
the top, eight feet three inches at the bottom, four feet[Pg 33]
eleven inches at the back, and six feet three inches at
the front. Taking four feet eleven inches as Radius,
and six feet three inches as Secant, then the Tangent is
three feet ten inches and three tenths.







Thus, in inches (√(75²-59²)) = 46·30 inches; therefore
the inclination of the stone must have been       slant
height 75 inches to 46·30 inches horizontal. Now,
46·30 is to 75, as 21 is to 34. Therefore, Col. Vyse's
casing stone agrees exactly with my ratio for the Pyramid
Cheops, viz., 21 to 34. (See Figure 29.)



Fig. 29. Col. Vyse     s Casing Stone.
75 : 46·3 :: 34 : 21


This stone must have been out of plumb at the back
an inch and seven tenths; perhaps to give room for
grouting the back joint of the marble casing stone to
the limestone body of the work: or, because, as it is
not a necessity in good masonry that the back of a
stone should be exactly plumb, so long as the error is[Pg 34]
on the right side, the builders might not have been particular
in that respect.



Fig. 59. (Temple of Cheops, standing at angle of wall.)



Figure 59 represents such a template as the masons
would have used in building Cheops, both for dressing
and setting the stones. (The courses are drawn out of
proportion to the template.) The other pyramids must
have been built by the aid of similar templates.

Such large blocks of stone as were used in the casing
of these pyramids could not have been completely
dressed before setting; the back and ends, and the top
and bottom beds were probably dressed off truly, and
the face roughly scabbled off; but the true slope angle
could not have been dressed off until the stone had been
truly set and bedded, otherwise there would have been
great danger to the sharp arises.



I shall now record the peculiarities of the 3, 4, 5 or
Pythagorean triangle, and the right-angled triangle 20,
21, 29.

Tangent + Secant = Diameter or 2 Radius
    Co-tan + Co-sec = 3 Radius

Figure 30 illustrates the preceding description.
Figure 31 shows the 3·1 triangle, and the 2·1 triangle
built up on the sine and co-sine of the 3, 4, 5 triangle.

The 3·1 triangle contains 18° 26′ 5·82″ and the 2·1
triangle 26° 33′ 54·19″; the latter has been frequently
noticed as a pyramid angle in the gallery inclinations.

Figure 32 shows these two triangles combined with
the 3, 4, 5 triangle, on the circumference of a circle.

The 20, 21, 29 triangle contains 43° 36′ 10·15″ and the
complement, 46° 23′ 49·85″.

[7] 12180 = 20 × 21 × 29

It is noticeable that while the multiplier required to
bring radius 5 and the rest into whole numbers, for the
3, 4, 5 triangle is twelve, in the 20, 21, 29 triangle it is
420, the key measure for the bases of the two main pyramids
in R.B. cubits.[8]

[8] 12 = 3 × 4, and 420 = 20 × 21

I am led to believe from study of the plan, and consideration
of the whole numbers in this 20, 21, 29 triangle,
that the R.B. cubit, like the Memphis cubit, was
divided into 280 parts.

The whole numbers of radius, sine, and co-sine divided
by 280, give a very pretty measure and series in R.B.
cubits, viz., 43½, 30, and 31½, or 87, 60, and 63, or 174, 120[Pg 37]
and 126;       all exceedingly useful in right-angled measurements.
Notice that the right-angled triangle 174,
120, 126, in the sum of its sides amounts to 420.

Figure 33 illustrates the 20, 21, 29 triangle. Figure
34 shows the 5·2 and 7·3 triangles built up on the sine
and co-sine of the 20, 21, 29 triangle.

The 5·2 triangle contains 21° 48′ 5·08″ and the 7·3
triangle 23° 11′ 54·98″.

Figure 35 shows how these two triangles are combined
with the 20, 21, 29 triangle on the circumference, and
Figure 36 gives a general view and identification of
these six triangles which occupied an important position
in the trigonometry of a people who did all their work
by right angles and proportional lines.

§ 8. GENERAL OBSERVATIONS.

It must be admitted that in the details of the building
of the Pyramids of Gïzeh there are traces of other
measures than R. B. cubits, but that the original cubit
of the plan was 1·685 British feet I feel no doubt. It
is a perfect and beautiful measure, fit for such a noble
design, and, representing as it does the sixtieth part of
a second of the Earth's polar circumference, it is and
was a measure for all time.

It may be objected that these ancient geometricians
could not have been aware of the measure of the
Earth's circumference; and wisely so, were it not for
two distinct answers that arise. The first being, that
since I think I have shown that Pythagoras never discovered
the Pythagorean triangle, but that it must have
been known and practically employed thousands of years
before his era, in the Egyptian Colleges where he
obtained his M.A. degree, so in the same way it is
probable that Eratosthenes, when he went to work to
prove that the earth's circumference was fifty times the
distance from Syene to Alexandria, may have obtained
the idea from his ready access to the ill-fated Alexandrian
Library, in which perhaps some record of the
learning of the builders of the Pyramids was stored.
And therefore I claim that there is no reason why the
pyramid builders should not have known as much about
the circumference of the earth as the modern world that
has calmly stood by in its ignorance and permitted[Pg 39]
those magnificent and, as I shall prove, useful edifices
to be stripped of their beautiful garments of polished
marble.

My second answer is that the correct cubit measure
may have been got by its inventors in a variety of other
ways; for instance, by observations of shadows of
heavenly bodies, without any knowledge even that the
earth was round; or it may have been evolved like the
British inch, which Sir John Herschel tells us is within
a thousandth part of being one five hundred millionth
of the earth's polar axis. I doubt if the circumference
of the earth was considered by the inventor of the
British inch.

It was a peculiarity of the Hindoo mathematicians
that they tried to make out that all they knew was very
old. Modern savants appear to take the opposite stand
for any little information they happen to possess.

The cubit which is called the Royal Babylonian
cubit and stated to measure O·5131 metre, differs so
slightly from my cubit, only the six-hundredth part of a
foot, that it may fairly be said to be the same cubit, and it
will be for antiquaries to trace the connection, as this
may throw some light on the identity of the builders of
the Pyramids of Gïzeh. Few good English two-foot
rules agree better than these two cubits do.

While I was groping about in the dark searching
for this bright needle, I tried on the plan many likely
ancient measures.

For a long time I worked in Memphis or Nilometric[Pg 40]
cubits, which I made 1·7126 British feet; they seem to
vary from 1·70 to 1·72, and although I made good use
of them in identifying other people's measures, still they
were evidently not in accordance with the design; but
the R.B. cubit of 1·685 British feet works as truly into
the plan of the Pyramids without fractions as it does
into the circumference of the earth.

Here I might, to prevent others from falling into one
of my errors, point out a rock on which I was
aground for a long time. I took the base of the Pyramid
Cheops, determined by Piazzi Smyth, from Bonwick's
"Pyramid Facts and Fancies" (a valuable little reference
book), as 763.81 British feet, and the altitude as
486.2567; and then from Piazzi Smyth's "Inheritance,"
page 27, I confirmed these figures, and so worked on
them for a long time, but found always a great flaw in
my work, and at last adopted a fresh base for Cheops,
feeling sure that Mr. Smyth's base was wrong: for I was
absolutely grounded in my conviction that at a certain
level, Cheops' and Cephren's measures bore certain relations
to each other. I subsequently found in another
part of Mr. Smyth's book, that the correct measures
were 761.65 and 484.91 British feet for base and altitude,
which were exactly what I wanted, and enabled me to
be in accordance with him in that pyramid which he
appears to have made his particular study.

For the information of those who may wish to compare
my measures, which are the results of an even or
regular circumference without fractions, with Mr. Smyth's[Pg 41]
measures, which are the results of an even or regular
diameter without fractions, it may be well to state that
there are just about 99 R.B. cubits in 80 of Piazzi
Smyth's cubits of 25 pyramid inches each.


§ 9. THE PYRAMIDS OF EGYPT, THE THEODOLITES OF THE EGYPTIAN LAND SURVEYORS.

About twenty-three years ago, on my road to Australia,
I was crossing from Alexandria to Cairo, and saw
the pyramids of Gïzeh.

I watched them carefully as the train passed along,
noticed their clear cut lines against the sky, and their
constantly changing relative position.

I then felt a strong conviction that they were built
for at least one useful purpose, and that purpose was
the survey of the country. I said, "Here be the Theodolites
of the Egyptians."

Built by scientific men, well versed in geometry, but
unacquainted with the use of glass lenses, these great
stone monuments are so suited in shape for the purposes
of land surveying, that the practical engineer or surveyor
must, after consideration, admit that they may
have been built mainly for that purpose.

Not only might the country have been surveyed by
these great instruments, and the land allotted at periodical
times to the people; but they, remaining always in
one position, were there to correct and readjust boundaries
destroyed or confused by the annual inundations of
the Nile.[Pg 42]

The Pyramids of Egypt may be considered as a
great system of landmarks for the establishment and
easy readjustment at any time of the boundaries of the
holdings of the people.

The Pyramids of Gïzeh appear to have been
main marks; and those of Abousir, Sakkârah, Dashow,
Lisht, Meydoun,      c., with the great pyramids in Lake
Mœris, subordinate marks, in this system, which was
probably extended from Chaldea through Egypt into
Ethiopia.

The pyramid builders may perhaps have made the
entombment of their Kings one of their exoteric objects,
playing on the morbid vanity of their rulers to induce
them to the work, but in the minds of the builders
before ever they built must have been planted the intention
to make use of the structures for the purposes of
land surveying.

The land of Egypt was valuable and maintained a
dense population; every year it was mostly submerged,
and the boundaries destroyed or confused. Every
soldier had six to twelve acres of land; the priests had
their slice of the land too; after every war a reallotment
of the lands must have taken place, perhaps every
year.

While the water was lying on the land, it so softened
the ground that the stone boundary marks must have
required frequent readjustment, as they would have been
likely to fall on one side.

By the aid of their great stone theodolites, the surveyors,[Pg 43]
who belonged to the priestly order, were able
to readjust the boundaries with great precision. That
all science was comprised in their secret mysteries may
be one reason why no hieroglyphic record of the scientific
uses of the pyramids remains. It is possible that at
the time of Diodorus and Herodotus, (and even when
Pythagoras visited Egypt,) theology may have so
smothered science, that the uses of the pyramids may
have been forgotten by the very priests to whom in
former times the knowledge belonged; but "a respectful
reticence" which has been noticed in some of these old
writers on pyramid and other priestly matters would
rather lead us to believe that an initiation into the mysteries
may have sealed their lips on subjects about which
they might otherwise have been more explicit.

The "closing" of one pyramid over another in
bringing any of their many lines into true order, must
even now be very perfect;       but now we can only
imagine the beauties of these great instrumental wonders
of the world when the casing stones were on them.
We can picture the rosy lights of one, and the bright
white lights of others; their clear cut lines against the
sky, true as the hairs of a theodolite; and the sombre
darkness of the contrasting shades, bringing out their
angles with startling distinctness. Under the influence
of the Eastern sun, the faces must have been a very
blaze of light, and could have been seen at enormous
distances like great mirrors.

I declare that the pyramids of Gïzeh in all their[Pg 44]
polished glory, before the destroyer stripped them
of their beautiful garments, were in every respect
adapted to flash around clearly defined lines of sight,
upon which the lands of the nation could be accurately
threaded. The very thought of these mighty theodolites
of the old Egyptians fills me with wonder and
reverence. What perfect and beautiful instruments
they were! never out of adjustment, always correct,
always ready; no magnetic deviation to allow for. No
wonder they took the trouble they did to build them so
correctly in their so marvellously suitable positions.

If Astronomers agree that observations of a
pole star could have been accurately made by peering
up a small gallery on the north side of one of the pyramids
only a few hundred feet in length, I feel that
I shall have little difficulty in satisfying them that
accurate measurements to points only miles away could
have been made from angular observations of the whole
group.


§ 10. HOW THE PYRAMIDS WERE MADE USE OF.

It appears from what I have already set forth that
the plan of the Pyramids under consideration is
geometrically exact, a perfect set of measures.

I shall now show how these edifices were applied to
a thoroughly geometrical purpose in the true meaning
of the word       to measure the Earth.

I shall show how true straight lines could be
extended from the Pyramids in given directions useful[Pg 45]
in right-angled trigonometry, by direct observation
of the buildings, and without the aid of other instruments.

And I shall show how by the aid of a simple instrument
angles could be exactly observed from any
point.

This Survey theory does not stand or fall on the
merits of my theory of the Gïzeh plan. Let it be
proved that this group is not built on the exact system
of triangulation set forth by me, it is still a fact that its
plan is in a similar shape, and any such shape would
enable a surveyor acquainted with the plan to lay down
accurate surveys by observations of the group even
should it not occupy the precise lines assumed by me.

And here I must state that although the lines
of the plan as laid down herein agree nearly with the
lines as laid down in Piazzi Smyth's book, in the
Penny Cyclopædia, and in an essay of Proctor's in the
Gentleman's Magazine, still I find that they do not agree
at all satisfactorily with a map of the Pyramids in
Sharp's "Egypt," said to be copied from Wilkinson's
map.

We will, however, for the time, and to explain my
survey theory, suppose the plan theory to be correct, as
I firmly believe it is.

And then, supposing it may be proved that the
respective positions of the pyramids are slightly different
to those that I have allotted to them on my
plan, it will only make a similar slight difference to[Pg 46]
the lines and angles which I shall here show could be
laid out by their aid.

Let us in the first place comprehend clearly the
shape of the land of Egypt.

A sector or fan, with a long handle       the fan or
sector, the delta; and the handle of the fan, the Nile
Valley, running nearly due south.

The Pyramids of Gïzeh are situate at the angle of
the sector, on a rocky eminence whence they can all be
seen for many miles. The summits of the two high
ones can be seen from the delta, and from the Nile
Valley to a very great distance; how far, I am unable
to say; but I should think that while the group could
be made general use of for a radius of fifteen miles, the
summits of Cephren and Cheops could be made use of
for a distance of thirty miles; taking into consideration
the general fall of the country.

It must be admitted that if meridian observations of
the star Alpha of the Dragon could be made with
accuracy by peeping up a small hole in one of the
pyramids, then surely might the surveyors have carried
true north and south lines up the Nile Valley as far as
the summit of Cheops was visible, by "plumbing in"
the star and the apex of the pyramid by the aid of
a string and a stone.

True east and west lines could have been made to
intersect such north and south lines from the various
groups of pyramids along the river banks, by whose aid
also such lines would be prolonged.[Pg 47]

Next, supposing that their astronomers had been
aware of the latitude of Cheops, and the annual northing
and southing of the sun, straight lines could have
been laid out in various sectoral directions to the north-eastward
and north-westward of Cheops, across the
delta, as far as the extreme apex of the pyramid was
visible, by observations of the sun, rising or setting
over his summit. (That the Dog-star was observed in
this manner from the north-west, I have little doubt.)




For this purpose, surveyors would be stationed at
suitable distances apart with their strings and their
stones, ready to catch the sun simultaneously, and at
the very moment he became transfixed upon the apex
of the pyramid, and was, as it were, "swallowed by it."
(See Figure 37.) The knowledge of the pyramid slope
angle from different points of view would enable the[Pg 48]
surveyor to place himself in readiness nearly on the
line.

Surely such lines as these would be as true and as
perfect as we could lay out nowadays with all our
modern instrumental appliances. A string and a stone
here, a clean-cut point of stone twenty miles away, and
a great ball of fire behind that point at a distance of
ninety odd million miles. The error in such a line
would be very trifling.

Such observations as last mentioned would have
been probably extended from Cephren for long lines, as
being the higher pyramid above the earth's surface, and
may have been made from the moon or stars.

In those days was the sun the intimate friend of
man. The moon and stars were his hand-maidens.

How many of us can point to the spot of the sun's
rising or setting? We, with our clocks, and our
watches, and our compasses, rarely observe the sun or
stars. But in a land and an age when the sun was the
only clock, and the pyramid the only compass, the
movements and positions of the heavenly bodies were
known to all. These people were familiar with the
stars, and kept a watch upon their movements.

How many of our vaunted educated population
could point out the Dog-star in the heavens?       but the
whole Egyptian nation hailed his rising as the beginning
of their year, and as the harbinger of their annual
blessing, the rising of the waters of the Nile.

[Pg 49]

It is possible therefore that the land surveyors of
Egypt made full use of the heavenly bodies in their
surveys of the land; and while we are pitifully laying
out our new countries by the circumferenter and the
compass, we presume to speak slightingly of the supposed
dark heathen days, when the land of Egypt was
surveyed by means of the sun and the stars, and the
theodolites were built of stone, with vertical limbs five
hundred feet in height, and horizontal limbs three thousand
feet in diameter.

Imagine half a dozen such instruments as this in a
distance of about sixty miles (for each group of pyramids
was effectually such an instrument), and we can
form some conception of the perfection of the surveys
of an almost prehistoric nation.

The centre of Lake Mœris, in which Herodotus tells
us two pyramids stood 300 feet above the level of the
lake, appears from the maps to be about S. 28° W., or S.
29° W. from Gïzeh, distant about 57 miles, and the Meidân
group of pyramids appears to be about 33 miles
due south of Gïzeh.

Figures 38, 39, 40 and 41, show that north-west,
south-east, north-east, and south-west lines from the
pyramids could be extended by simply plumbing the
angles. These lines would be run in sets of two's and
three's, according to the number of pyramids in the
group; and their known distances apart at that angle
would check the correctness of the work.

A splendid line was the line bearing 43° 36′ 10·15″,
or 223° 36′ 10·15″ from Cheops and Cephren, the pyramids[Pg 50]
covering each other, the line of hypotenuse of the
great 20, 21, 29 triangle of the plan. This I call the
20, 21 line. (See Figure 42.)

Figure 43 represents the 3, 4, 5 triangle line from
the summits of Mycerinus and Cheops in true line bearing
216° 52' 11·65". This I call the south 4, west 3 line.

The next line is what I call the 2, 1 line, and is
illustrated by figure 44. It is one of the most perfect
of the series, and bears S. 26° 33' 54·9" W. from the
apex of Cephren. This line demonstrates clearly why
Mycerinus was cased with red granite.

Not in memory of the beautiful and rosy-cheeked
Nitocris, as some of the tomb theory people say, but for
a less romantic but more useful object; simply because,
from this quarter, and round about, the lines of the
pyramids would have been confused if Mycerinus had
not been of a different color. The 2, 1 line is a line in
which Mycerinus would have been absolutely lost in
the slopes of Cephren but for his red color. There is
not a fact that more clearly establishes my theory, and
the wisdom and forethought of those who planned the
Gïzeh pyramids, than this red pyramid Mycerinus, and
the 2, 1 line.

Hekeyan Bey, speaks of this pyramid as of a "ruddy
complexion;" John Greaves quotes from the Arabic
book, Morat Alzeman, "and the lesser which is coloured;"
and an Arabic writer who dates the Pyramids
three hundred years before the Flood, and cannot find
among the learned men of Egypt "any certain relation
concerning them" nor any "memory of them amongst[Pg 51]
men," also expatiates upon the beauties of the "coloured
satin" covering of this one particular pyramid.

Figure 45 represents the line south 96, west 55,
from Cephren, bearing 209° 48' 32·81"; the apex of
Cephren is immediately above the apex of Mycerinus.

Figure 46 is the S. 3 W. 1 line, bearing 198° 26' 5.82";
here the dark slope angle of the pyramids with the sun
to the eastward occupies half of the apparent half
base.

Figure 47 is the S. 5, W. 2 line, bearing 201° 48' 5";
here Cephren and Mycerinus are in outside slope line.

Figure 48 is the S. 7 W. 3 line, bearing 203° 11' 55";
here the inside slope of Cephren springs from the
centre of the apparent base of Mycerinus.

I must content myself with the preceding examples
of a few pyramid lines, but must have said enough to
show that from every point of the compass their appearance
was distinctly marked and definitely to be
determined by surveyors acquainted with the plan.


§ 11. DESCRIPTION OF THE ANCIENT PORTABLE SURVEY INSTRUMENT.

I must now commence with a single pyramid, show
how approximate observations could be made from it,
and then extend the theory to a group with the observations
thereby rendered more perfect and delicate.

We will suppose the surveyor to be standing looking
at the pyramid Cephren; he knows that its base is[Pg 52]
420 cubits, and its apothem 346½ cubits. He has provided
himself with a model in wood, or stone, or metal, and
one thousandth of its size       therefore his model will be
O.42 cubit base, and O.3465 cubit apothem       or, in
round numbers, eight and half inches base, and seven
inches apothem.

This model is fixed on the centre of a card or
disc, graduated from the centre to the circumference,
like a compass card, to the various points of the compass,
or divisions of a circle.

The model pyramid is fastened due north and south
on the lines of this card or disc, so that when the north
point of the card points north, the north face of the
model pyramid faces to the north.

The surveyor also has a table, which, with a pair of
plumb lines or mason's levels, he can erect quite level:
this table is also graduated from the centre with divisions
of a circle, or points of the compass, and it is larger
than the card or disc attached to the model.

This table is made so that it can revolve upon its
stand, and can be clamped. We will call it the lower
limb. There is a pin in the centre of the lower limb,
and a hole in the centre of the disc bearing the model,
which can be thus placed upon the centre of the table,
and becomes the upper limb. The upper limb can be
clamped to the lower limb.

The first process will be to clamp both upper and
lower limbs together, with the north and south lines of
both in unison, then revolve both limbs on the stand till[Pg 53]
the north and south line points straight for the pyramid
in the distance, which is done by the aid of sights
erected at the north and south points of the perimeter
of the lower limb. When this is adjusted, clamp the
lower limb and release the upper limb; now revolve the
upper limb until the model pyramid exactly covers the
pyramid in the distance, and shows just the same shade
on one side and light on the other, when viewed from
the sights of the clamped lower limb       and the lines,
angles, and shades of the model coincide with the lines,
angles, and shades of the pyramid observed;       now
clamp the upper limb. Now does the model stand
really due north and south, the same as the pyramid in
the distance; it throws the same shades, and exhibits
the same angles when seen from the same point of
view; just as much of it is in shade and as much of it
is in light as the pyramid under observation; therefore
it must be standing due north and south, because Cephren
himself is standing due north and south, and the
upper limb reads off on the lower limb the angle or
bearing observed.

So far we possess an instrument equal to the modern
circumferenter, and yet we have only brought one pyramid
into work.

If I have shown that such an operation as the above
is practically feasible, if I have shown that angles can
be taken with moderate accuracy by observing one
pyramid of 420 cubits base, how much more accurate
will the observation be when the surveyor's plane table[Pg 54]
bears a group of pyramids which occupy a representative
space of about 1400 cubits when viewed from the south
or north, and about 1760 cubits when viewed from the
east or west. If situated a mile or two south of the
Gïzeh group our surveyor could also tie in and perfect
his work by sights to the Sâkkarah group with Sâkkarah
models; and so on, up the Nile Valley, he would find
every few miles groups of pyramids by aid of which he
would be enabled to tie his work together.

If the Gïzeh group of pyramids is placed and shaped
in the manner I have described, it must be clear that an
exact model and plan, say a thousandth of the size, could
be very easily made       the plan being at the level of the
base of Cephren where the bases of the two main
pyramids are even;       and if they are not exactly so
placed and shaped, it may be admitted that their position
and dimensions were known to the surveyors or priests,
so that such models could be constructed. It is probable,
therefore, that the instrument used in conjunction with
these pyramids, was a machine constructed in a similar
manner to the simple machine I have described, only
instead of there being but one model pyramid on the
disc or upper limb, it bore the whole group; and the
smaller pyramids were what we may call vernier points
in this great circle, enabling the surveyor to mark off
known angles with great accuracy by noticing how, as
he worked round the group of pyramids, one or other
of the smaller ones was covered by its neighbours.[9]
[9] See general plan of Gïzeh Group op. page 1.

[Pg 55]

The immensity of the main pyramids would require
the smaller ones to be used for surveys in the immediate
neighbourhood, as the surveyor might easily
be too close to get accurate observations from the main
pyramids.

The upper limb, then, was a disc or circular plate
bearing the model of the group.

Cheops would be situated in the centre of the circle,
and observations would be taken by bringing the whole
model group into even line and even light and shade
with the Gïzeh group.

I believe that with a reasonable-sized model occupying
a circle of six or seven feet diameter, such as a
couple of men could carry, very accurate bearings could
have been taken, and probably were taken.

The pyramid shape is the very shape of all others
to employ for such purposes. A cone would be useless,
because the lights and shades would be softened off and
its angles from all points would be the same. Other
solids with perpendicular angles would be useless,
because although they would vary in width from different
points of view they would not present that ever changing
angle that a pyramid does when viewed from different
directions.

After familiarity with the models which I have made
use of in prosecuting these investigations, I find that I
can judge with great accuracy from their appearance
only the bearing of the group from any point at which
I stand. I make bold to say that the pocket compass[Pg 56]
of the Egyptian surveyor was a little model of the group
of pyramids in his district, and he had only to hold it
up on his hand and turn it round in the sun till its
shades and angles corresponded with the appearance of
the group, to tell as well as we could tell by our compasses,
perhaps better, his bearing from the landmarks
that governed his surveys.

The Great Circle of Gold described by Diodorus
(Diod. Sic. lib. X., part 2, cap. 1) as having been employed
by the Egyptians, and on which was marked
amongst other things, the position of the rising and
setting of the stars, and stated by him to have been
carried off by Cambysses when Egypt was conquered
by the Persians, is supposed by Cassini to
have been also employed for finding the meridian
by observation of the rising and setting of the sun.
This instrument and others described by writers
on Egypt would have been in practice very similar
to the instrument which I have described as having
been probably employed for terrestrial observations.

The table or disc comprising the lower limb of the
instrument, might have been supported upon a small
stand with a circular hole in the centre, so arranged that
the instrument could be either set up alone and supported
by its own tripod, or rested fairly on the top of
any of those curious stone boundary marks which were
made use of, not only to mark the corners of the different
holdings, but to show the level of the Nile inundations.[Pg 57]
(See Figure 49, copied from Sharpe's Egypt,
vol. I., p. 6.) The peculiar shape of the top of these
stone landmarks, or "sacred boundary stones," appears
suitable for such purposes, and it would have been a
great convenience to the surveyor, and conducive to
accuracy, that it should be so arranged that the instrument
should be fixed immediately over the mark, as
appears probable from the shape of the stone.

A noticeable point in this theory is, that it is not in
the least essential that the apex of a pyramid should be
complete. If their summits were left permanently flat,
they would work in for survey purposes quite as well,
and I think better, than if carried to a point, and they
would be more useful with a flat top for defined shadows
when used as sun dials.

In the Gïzeh group, the summit of Cheops appears
to me to have been left incomplete the better to get the
range with Cephren for lines down the delta.

In this system of surveying, there is always a beautiful
connection between the horizontal bearings and the
apparent or observed angles presented by the slopes and
edges of the pyramid. Thus, in pyramids like those of
Gïzeh, which stand north and south, and whose meridional
sections contain less, and whose diagonal sections
contain more than a right angle, the vertex being the
point at which the angle is measured       this law holds:       
That[Pg 58]
the smallest interior angle at the vertex, contained
between the inside edge and the outside
edge, will exhibit the same angle as the bearing
of the observer's eye from the apex of the
pyramid when the angle at the apex contained
by the outside edges appears to be a right angle.

Figures 50 to 55 inclusive illustrate this beautiful law from which it
will be seen that the Gïzeh surveyors possessed, in this manner alone,
eight distinctly defined bearings from each pyramid.

I recommend any one desirous to thoroughly comprehend
these matters, to make a plan from my diagram,
Figure 5, using R.B. cubits for measures, and to a suitable
scale, on a piece of card-board. Then to cut out
of the card-board the squares of the bases of the pyramids
at the level of Cephren, viz., 420, 420 and 218
cubits respectively, for the three main pyramids.
One hundred cubits to the inch is a convenient scale and
within the limits of a sheet of Bath board.

By striking out the models on card-board in the
manner shown by diagrams (see Figures 56, 57, and 58)
they can be cut out with a penknife       cutting only half[Pg 60]
through where the lines are dotted       bent up together,
and pasted along the edges with strips of writing paper
about half an inch wide.

These models can be dropped into the squares cut
out of the card-board plan, thus correcting the error
caused by the thickness of the card-board base, and if
placed in the sun, or at night by the light of one lamp
or candle properly placed to represent the sun in the
eastward or westward, the clear cut lines and clear contrasting
shades will be manifest, and the lines illustrated
by my figures can be identified.

When inspecting the model, it is well to bear in
mind that the eye must be kept very nearly level with
the table, or the pyramids will appear as if viewed from
a balloon.



I believe that the stones were got up to the building
by way of the north side of each pyramid. The casing
on the south, east, and west, was probably built up as
the work proceeded, and the whole of these three faces
were probably thus finished and completed while there
was not a single casing stone set on the north side.
Then the work would be closed up until there remained
nothing but a great gap or notch, wide at the bottom,
and narrowing to the apex. The work on the north
side would then be closed from the sides and top, and
the bottom casing stone about the centre of the north
side, would be the last stone set on the building.[Pg 61]
These old builders were too expert not to have thus
made use of all the shade which their own building
would thus afford to a majority of the workmen.



Many of the obelisks were probably marks on pyramid
lines of survey.

The pyramid indeed may have been a development
of the obelisk for this purpose.

Their slanting sides might correspond with some of
the nearly upright slant angles of the pyramids, in positions
opposite certain lines. Reference to several of
my figures will show how well this would come in.

Herodotus speaks of two obelisks at Heliopolis, and
Bonwick tells us that Abd al Latif saw two there which
he called Pharaoh's Needles. An Arab traveller, in
1190, saw a pyramid of copper on the summit of the
one that remained, but it is now wanting. Pharaoh's
Needles appear to have been situated about 20 miles
NE. of the Gïzeh group, and their slope angles might
have coincided with the apparent slope angles of Cephren
or Cheops on the edge nearest the obelisk.

The ancient method of describing the meridian by
means of the shadow of a ball placed on the summit of
an obelisk points to a reasonable interpretation for the
peculiar construction of the two pillars, Jachin and
Boaz, which are said to have been situated in front of
the Hebrew Temple at Jerusalem, and about which so
much mysterious speculation has occurred.[Pg 62]

They were no doubt used as sun-dials for the morning
and afternoon sun by the shadow of the balls or
"chapiters" thrown upon the pavement.

Without presuming to dispute the objects assigned
by others for the galleries and passages which have been
discovered in the pyramid Cheops, I venture to opine
that they were employed to carry water to the builders.
They are connected with a well, and the well with the
Nile or canal. Whether the water was slided up the
smooth galleries in boxes, or whether the cochlea, or
water screw, was worked in them, their angles being
suitable, it is impossible to conjecture; either plan
would have been convenient and feasible.

These singular chambers and passages may indeed
possibly have had to do with some hydraulic machinery
of great power which modern science knows nothing
about. The section of the pyramid, showing these
galleries, in the pyramid books, has a most hydraulic
appearance.

The tremendous strength and regularity of the cavities
called the King's and Queen's chambers, the regularity
and the smallness of most of the passages or massive
stone connecting pipes, favor the idea that the chambers
might have been reservoirs, their curious roofs,
air chambers, and the galleries or passages, connecting
pipes for working water under pressure. Water raised
through the passages of this one pyramid nearest to the
canal, might have been carried by troughs to the other
pyramids, which were in all probability in course of construction[Pg 63]
at the same period of time. A profane friend
of mine thinks that the sarcophagus or "sacred coffer"
in the King's chamber may have been used by the chief
architect and leading men of the works as a bath, and
that the King's chamber was nothing more or less
than a delightful bath room.



The following quotation from the writing of an
Arabian author (Ibn Abd Alkokm), is extracted from
Bonwick's "Pyramid Facts and Fancies," page 72:       "The
Coptites mention in their books that upon them
(the Pyramids) is an inscription engraven; the exposition
of it in Arabicke is this:       'I, Saurid the King
built the Pyramids (in such and such a time), and
finished them in six years; he that comes after me, and
says he is equal to me, let him destroy them in six
hundred years; and yet it is known that it is easier to
pluck down than to build; and when I had finished
them, I covered them with sattin, and let him cover them
with slats.'"

The italics are my own. The builder seems to have
entertained the idea that his work would be partially
destroyed, and afterwards temporarily repaired or
rebuilt. The first part has unfortunately come true,
and it is possible that the last part of the idea of King
Saurid may be carried out, because it would not be so
very expensive an undertaking for any civilized nation
in the interest of science to re-case the pyramids[Pg 64]
of Gïzeh, so that they might be once more applied
to land-surveying purposes in the ancient manner.

It would not be absolutely necessary to case the
whole of the pyramid faces, so long as sufficient casing
was put on to define the angles. The "slats" used
might be a light wooden framework covered with thin
metal. The metal should be painted white, except
in the case of Mycerinus, which should be of a reddish
color.

Fig. 60.



Reference to Fig. 60 and the preceding table, will
show that the main triangular dimensions of this plan
(imperfect as it is from the lack of eleven pyramids)
are represented by four main triangles, viz:       




Ratio.
C A D C .. ..3,4,5
F B A F .. ..20,21,29
A B J A .. ..28,45,53
F W V F .. ..48,55,73

Figures 30 to 36 illustrate the two former, and Figures
61 and 62 illustrate the two latter. I will call triangles
of this class "primary triangles," as the most suitable
term, although it is applied to the main triangles of
geodetic surveys.[Pg 66]

We have only to select a number of such triangles
and a system of trigonometry ensues, in which base,
perpendicular, and hypotenuse of every triangle is a
whole measure without fractions, and in which the
nomenclature for every angle is clear and simple.

An angle of 43° 36′ 10·15″ will be called a 20, 21
angle, and an angle of 36° 52′ 11·65″ will be called a
3, 4 angle, and so on.

In the existing system whole angles, such as 40, 45,
or 50 degrees, are surrounded by lines, most of which
can only be described in numbers by interminable
fractions.

In the ancient system, lines are only dealt with, and
every angle in the table is surrounded by lines measuring
whole units, and described by the use of a couple of
simple numbers.

Connecting this with our present system of trigonometry
would effect a saving in calculation, and general
use of certain peculiar angles by means of which
all the simplicity and beauty of the work of the ancients
would be combined with the excellences of our modern
instrumental appliances. Surveyors should appreciate
the advantages to be derived from laying out traverses
on the hypotenuses of "primary" triangles, by the
saving of calculation and facility of plotting to be obtained
from the practice.

The key to these old tables is the fact, that in "primary"
triangles the right-angled triangle formed by the
sine and versed sine, also by the co-sine and co-versed-sine,[Pg 67]
is one in which base and perpendicular are measured
by numbers without fractions. These I will call
"satellite" triangles.

Thus, to the "primary" triangle 20, 21, 29, the ratios
of the co-sinal and sinal satellites are respectively 7 to 3,
and 2 to 5. (See Figure 35.) To the 48, 55, 73 triangle
the satellites are 11, 5 and 8, 3 (Fig. 62); to the 3, 4, 5
triangle they are 2, 1 and 3, 1 (Fig. 30); and to the 28,
45, 53 triangle, they are 9, 5 and 7, 2 (Fig. 61). The
primary triangle, 7, 24, 25, possesses as satellites the
"primary" triangle, 3, 4, 5, and the ordinary triangle,
4, 1; and the primary triangle 41, 840, 841, is attended
by the 20, 21, 29 triangle, as a satellite with the ordinary
triangle 41, 1, and so on.


Fig. 61.

The 28-45-53 Triangle.


Fig. 62.

The 48-55-73 Triangle.

Since any ratio, however, whose terms, one or both,
are represented by fractions, can be transformed into
whole numbers, it evidently follows that every conceivable[Pg 68]
relative measure of two lines which we may decide
to call co-sine and co-versed-sine, becomes a satellite to
a corresponding "primary" triangle.

Now, since the angle of the satellite on the circumference
must be half the angle of the adjacent primary
triangle at the centre, it follows that in constructing a
list of satellites and their angles, the angles of the corresponding
primary triangles can be found. For instance       


Satellite 8, 3, contains 20° 33′ 21·76″
Satellite 2, 7, contains 15° 56′ 43·425″


Each of these angles doubled, gives the angle of a
"primary" triangle as follows, viz.:       


The 48, 55, 73 triangle = 41°  6′ 43·52″
The 28, 45, 53 triangle = 31° 53′ 26·85″


The angles of the satellites together must always be
45°, because the angle at the circumference of a quadrant
must always be 135°.

From the Gïzeh plan, as far as I have developed it,
the following order of satellites begins to appear, which
may be a guide to the complete Gïzeh plan ratio, and
to those "primary" triangles in use by the pyramid
surveyors in their ordinary work.[Pg 69]




1,22,33,44,55,66,77,88,9
1, 32,5 3, 5 4,7 5,77,9
1, 42,7 3, 7 4,9 5,8
1, 52,9 3, 85,97,1
1, 65,11
1, 7 3,115,13
1, 8 3,13
1, 9
1,11
1,13
1,15
1,17

Primary triangles may be found from the angle of
the satellite, but it is an exceedingly round-about way.
I will, however, give an example.

Let us construct a primary triangle from the satellite
4, 9.



Rad. × 4 = ·4444444 = Tangt.      23° 57′ 45·041″
9
∠ 23° 57′ 45·041″ × 2 = 47° 55′ 30·083″.
therefore the angles of the "primary" are 47° 55′ 30·083″.
and 42°  4′ 29·917″.
The natural sine of 42° 4′ 29·917″ = ·6701025.
  The natural co-sine 42° 4′ 29·917″ = ·7422684.


[Pg 70]

The greatest common measure of these numbers is
about 102717, therefore       




 Radius10000000÷ 102717 = 97
 Co-sine 7422684÷ 102717 = 72
 Sine 6701025÷ 102717 = 65

and 65, 72, 97 is the primary triangle to which the satellites
are 4, 9, and 5, 13. (See Fig. 63.) The figures
in the calculation do not balance exactly, in consequence
of the insufficient delicacy of the tables or calculations.


Fig. 63.



The connection between primaries and satellites is
shown by figure 64.


Fig. 64.



Let the triangle ADB be a satellite, 5, 2, which we
will call BD 20, and AD 8. Let C be centre of semi-circle
ABE.[Pg 71]




 AD:DB::DB:DE=50(Euc. VI. 8)
 AD+DE =AE=58= diameter
 AE÷2 =AC= BC=29= radius
 AC-AD =DC=21= co-sine
andDB=20=sine

From the preceding it is manifest that       



sine²+ ver-s = dia.
ver-s


The formula to find the "primary triangle" to any
satellite is as follows:       

Let the long ratio line of the satellite or sine be
called a, and the short ratio line or versed-sine be called
b. Then       


(1)a= sine.
(2)a² + b²= radius.
2b
(3)a² - b²= co-sine.
2b


Therefore various primary triangles can be constructed
on a side DB (Fig. 64) as sine, by taking different
measures for AD as versed-sine.
For example       


From Satellite 5, 1.




5= sine.= 5
5² + 1²= radius.= 13
2 × 1
5² - 1²= co-sine.= 12
2 × 1


[Pg 72]



From Satellite 5, 2.





5= sine.= 5
5² + 2²= radius.= 7¼
2 × 2
5² - 2²= co-sine.= 5¼
2 × 2



× 4




= 20= 29= 21





Finally arises the following simple rule for the construction
of "primaries" to contain any angle       Decide
upon a satellite which shall contain half the angle       say,
5, 1. Call the first figure a, the second b, then       


    a² + b² = hypotenuse.
    a² - b  = perpendicular.
    a  × 2b = base.





 "Primary" Lowest Ratio.
 Thus        5² + 1² = 26= 13
 Satellite 5,1 5² - 1²= 24= 12
 5 × 2 × 1= 10= 5
 and        5² + 2²= 29= 29
 Satellite 5,2 5² - 2²= 21= 21
 5 × 2 × 2= 20= 20

Having found the lowest ratio of the three sides of
a "primary" triangle, the lowest whole numbers for
tangent, secant, co-secant, and co-tangent, if required,
are obtained in the following manner.

Take for example the 20, 21, 29 triangle, now
20 × 21 = 420, and 29 × 420 = 12180, a new radius instead
of 29 from which with the sine 20, and co-sine 21,
increased in the same ratio, the whole canon of the
20, 21, 29 triangle will come out in whole numbers.[Pg 73]

Similarly in the triangle 48, 55, 73, radius 73 × 13200
(the product of 48 × 55) makes radius in whole numbers
963600, for an even canon without fractions. This is
because sine and co-sine are the two denominators in
the fractional parts of the other lines when worked out
at the lowest ratio of sine, co-sine, and radius.

After I found that the plan of the Gïzeh group was
a system of "primary" triangles, I had to work out the
rule for constructing them, for I had never met with it
in any book, but I came across it afterwards in the
"Penny Encyclopedia," and in Rankine's "Civil Engineering."

The practical utility of these triangles, however, does
not appear to have received sufficient consideration. I
certainly never met with any except the 3, 4, 5, in the
practice of any surveyor of my acquaintance.

(For squaring off a line nothing could be more convenient
than the 20, 21, 29 triangle; for instance, taking
a base of 40 links, then using the whole chain for
the two remaining sides of 42 and 58 links.)[Pg 74]

and to the tables here introduced, will shew that
most of the primary triangles mentioned are indicated
on the plan ratio table principally by the lines corresponding
to the ratios of the satellites. Thus

It seems probable that could I add to my pyramid
plan the lines and triangles that the missing eleven pyramids
would supply, it would comprise a complete table
on which would appear indications of all the ratios and[Pg 77]
triangles made use of in right-angled trigonometry, a
"ratiometer" in fact.

I firmly believe that so far as I have gone it is correct       and
it is possible, therefore, with the start that I
have made, for others to continue the work, and add the
eleven pyramids to the plan in their correct geometrical
position. By continuing the system of evolution by
which I defined the position of Cephren, and the little
pyramid to the south-east of Cheops, after I had obtained
Cheops and Mycerinus, may be rebuilt, at one
and the same time, a skeleton of the trigonometrical
tables of a forgotten civilization, and the plan of those
pyramids which are its only link with the present age.


§ 13. THE SIZE AND SHAPE OF THE PYRAMIDS INDICATED BY THE PLAN.

I pursued my investigations into the slopes and altitudes
of the pyramids without reference to the plan,
after once deciding their exact bases.

Now it will be interesting to note some of the ways
in which the plan hints at the shape and size of these
pyramids, and corroborates my work.

The dimensions of Cheops are indicated on the plan
by the lines EA to YA, measuring 840 and 288 R.B.
cubits respectively, being the half periphery of its horizontal
section at the level of Cephren's base, and its
own altitude from its own base. (See Fig. 5.)

The line EA, in fact, represents in R.B. cubits the
half periphery of the bases of either Cheops or Cephren[Pg 78]
measured at the level which I have set forth as the
plan level, viz., base of Cephren.

The ratio of Cephren's base to Cephren's altitude is
indicated on the plan by the ratios of the lines BC to
EB, or FO to OR, viz., 32 to 21. (See Fig. 4.)

The altitude of Mycerinus above Cephren's base
appears on plan in the line EF, measuring 136 R.B.
cubits.

The line EO on plan measures 888 cubits, which
would be the length of a line stretched from the apex
of Cheops to the point E, at the level of Cheops' base.

This merits consideration:       the lines EA and AY
are connected on plan at the centre of Cheops, and the
lines EO and EA are connected on plan at the point E.

Now the lines EO, EA and AY are sides of a "primary
triangle," whose ratio is 37, 35, 12, and whose
measure in cubits is 888, 840, and 288; and if we suppose
the line EA to be stretched horizontally beneath
the pyramids at the level of the base of Cheops from
E to A on plan, and the line AY to be a plumb line
hanging from the apex of Cheops to the level of his
base, then will the line EO just stretch from the point
E to the apex of Cheops, and the three lines will connect
the two main pyramids by a vertical triangle of
which EA, AY and EO form the base, perpendicular,
and hypotenuse. Or, to explain it in another manner:
let the line EA be a cord stretching horizontally from
A at the centre of the base of Cheops to the point E,
both ends being at the same level; let the line AY be a[Pg 79]
rod, lift it on the end A till it stands erect, then is the
end Y the apex of Cheops. Now, the line EO would
just stretch from the top of the rod AY to the point
E first described.

It is a singular coincidence, and one that may be
interesting to students of the interior of the Pyramids,
that the side EP, of the small 3, 4, 5 triangle, EP,
PF, FE, in the centre of the plan, measures 81·60 R.B.
cubits, which is very nearly eight times the "true
breadth" of the King's chamber in Cheops, according
to Piazzi Smyth; for 81·60/8 = 10·20 R.B. cubits, or
206·046 pyramid inches (one R.B. cubit being 20·2006
pyramid inches). The sides of this little triangle measure
81·60, 108·80, and 136, R.B. cubits respectively, as
can be easily proved from the plan ratio table.


§ 14. A SIMPLE INSTRUMENT FOR LAYING OFF "PRIMARY TRIANGLES."

A simple instrument for laying off "primary triangles"
upon the ground, might have been made with
three rods divided into a number of small equal divisions,
with holes through each division, which rods
could be pinned together triangularly, the rods working
as arms on a flat table, and the pins acting as pointers
or sights.

One of the pins would be permanently fixed in the
table through the first hole of two of the rods or arms,
and the two other pins would be movable so as to fix[Pg 80]
the arms into the shape of the various "primary triangles."

Thus with the two main arms pinned to the cross
arm in the 21st and 29th hole from the permanently
pinned end, with the cross arm stretched to twenty divisions,
a 20, 21, 29 triangle would be the result, and
so on.


§ 14a. GENERAL OBSERVATIONS.

I must be excused by geometricians for going so
much in detail into the simple truths connected with
right-angled trigonometry. My object has been to
make it very clear to that portion of the public not
versed in geometry, that the Pyramids of Egypt must
have been used for land surveying by right-angled triangles
with sides having whole numbers.

A re-examination of these pyramids on the ground
with the ideas suggested by the preceding pages in
view, may lead to interesting discoveries.

For instance, it is just possible that the very accurately
and beautifully worked stones in the walls of the
King's chamber of Cheops, may be found to indicate
the ratios of the rectangles formed by the bases and perpendiculars
of the triangulations used by the old surveyors       that
on these walls may be found, in fact, corroboration
of the theory that I have set forth. I am led
to believe also from the fact that Gïzeh was a central
and commanding locality, and that it was the custom of
those who preceded those Egyptians that history tells[Pg 81]
of, to excavate mighty caverns in the earth       that, therefore,
in the limestone upon which the pyramids are
built, and underneath the pyramids, may be found vast
excavations, chambers and galleries, that had entrance
on the face of the ridge at the level of High Nile.
From this subterraneous city, occupied by the priests
and the surveyors of Memphis, access may be found to
every pyramid; and while to the outside world the
pyramids might have appeared sealed up as mausoleums
to the Kings that it may have seen publicly interred
therein, this very sealing and closing of the outer
galleries may have only rendered their mysterious
recesses more private to the priests who entered from
below, and who were, perhaps, enabled to ascend by private
passages to their very summits. The recent discovery
of a number of regal mummies stowed away in
an out of the way cave on the banks of the Nile, points
to the unceremonious manner in which the real rulers
of Kings and people may have dealt with their sovereigns,
the pomp and circumstance of a public burial
once over. It is just possible that the chambers in the
pyramids may have been used in connection with their
mysteries: and the small passages called by some "ventilators"
or "air passages," sealed as they were from
the chamber by a thin stone (and therefore no ventilators)
may have been auditory passages along which
sound might have been projected from other chambers
not yet opened by the moderns; sounds which were
perhaps a part of the "hanky panky" of the ancient[Pg 82]
ceremonial connected with the "mysteries" or the "religion"
of that period.

Down that "well" which exists in the interior of
Cheops, and in the limestone foundations of the pyramid,
should I be disposed to look for openings into the
vast subterraneous chambers which I am convinced do
exist below the Pyramids of Gïzeh.

The priests of the Pyramids of Lake Mœris had
their vast subterranean residences. It appears to me
more than probable that those of Gïzeh were similarly
provided. And I go further:       Out of these very
caverns may have been excavated the limestone of
which the pyramids were built, thus killing two birds
with one stone       building the instruments and finding
cool quarters below for those who were to make use of
them. In the bowels of that limestone ridge on which
the pyramids are built will yet be found, I feel convinced,
ample information as to their uses. A good
diamond drill with two or three hundred feet of rods is
what is what is wanted to test this, and the solidity of
the pyramids at the same time.


§ 15. PRIMARY TRIANGULATION.

Primary triangulation would be useful to men of
almost every trade and profession in which tools or
instruments are used. Any one might in a short time
construct a table for himself answering to every degree
or so in the circumference of a circle for which only
forty or fifty triangles are required.[Pg 83]

It would be worth while for some one to print and
publish a correct set of these tables embracing a close
division of the circle, in which set there should be a
column showing the angle in degrees, minutes, seconds
and decimals, and also a column for the satellite, thus       




 SATELLITE.        PRIMARY.        ANGLE.
 5 2       20 21 29        43° 36′ 10·15″
 7 3       21 20 29        46° 23′ 49·85″


and so on. Such a set of tables would be a boon to
sailors, architects, surveyors, engineers, and all handi-craftsmen:
and I make bold to say, would assist in the
intricate investigations of the astronomer:       and the
rule for building the tables is so simple, that they could
easily be achieved. The architect from these tables
might arrange the shape of his chambers, passages or
galleries, so that all measures, not only at right angles
on the walls, but from any corner of floor to ceiling
should be even feet. The pitch of his roofs might be
more varied, and the monotony of the buildings relieved,
with rafters and tie-beams always in even measures.
The one solitary 3, 4, 5 of Vitruvius would cease to be
his standard for a staircase; and even in doors and
sashes, and panels of glass, would he be alive to the
perfection of rectitude gained by evenly-measured diagonals.
By a slight modification of the compass card,
the navigator of blue water might steer his courses on
the hypotenuses of great primary triangles       such tables
would be useful to all sailors and surveyors who have
to deal with latitude and departure. For instance, familiarity[Pg 84]
with such tables would make ever present in
the mind of the surveyor or sailor his proportionate
northing and easting, no matter what course he was
steering between north and east, "the primary" embraces
the three ideas in one view.

In designing trussed roofs or bridges, the "primaries"
would be invaluable to the engineer, strain-calculations
on diagonal and upright members would be
simplified, and the builder would find the benefit of a
measure in even feet or inches from centre of one pin
or connection to another.

For earthwork slopes 3, 4, 5; 20, 21, 29; 21, 20, 29;
and 4, 3, 5 would be found more convenient ratios than
1 to 1, and 1½ to 1, etc. Templates and battering rules
would be more perfect and correct, and the engineer
could prove his slopes and measure his work at one
and the same time without the aid of a staff or level;
the slope measures would reveal the depth, and the
slope measures and bottom width would be all the
measures required, while the top width would prove the
correctness of the slopes and the measurements.

To the land surveyor, however, the primary triangle
would be the most useful, and more especially to those
laying out new holdings, whether small or large, in new
countries.

Whether it be for a "squatter's run," or for a town
allotment, the advantages of a diagonal measure to
every parallelogram in even miles, chains, or feet, should
be keenly felt and appreciated.[Pg 85]

This was, I believe, one of the secrets of the speedy
and correct replacement of boundary marks by the
Egyptian land surveyors.

I have heard of a review in the "Contemporary,"
September, 1881, referring to the translation of a papyrus
in the British Museum, by Dr. Eisenlohr       "A
handbook of practical arithmetic and geometry," etc., "such
as we might suppose would be used by a scribe acting as
clerk of the works, or by an architect to shew the working
out of the problems he had to solve in his operations."
I should like to see a translation of the book, from which
it appears that "the clumsiness of the Egyptian method
is very remarkable." Perhaps this Egyptian "Handbook"
may yet shew that their operations were not so
"clumsy," as they appear at first sight to those accustomed
to the practice of modern trigonometry. I may
not have got the exact "hang" of the Egyptian method
of land surveying       for I do not suppose that even their
"clumsy" method is to be got at intuitively; but I claim
that I have shewn how the Pyramids could be used for
that purpose, and that the subsidiary instrument described
by me was practicable.

I claim, therefore, that the theory I have set up,
that the pyramids were the theodolites of the Egyptians,
is sound. That the ground plan of these pyramids
discloses a beautiful system of primary triangles
and satellites I think I have shown beyond the shadow
of a doubt; and that this system of geometric triangulation
or right-angled trigonometry was the method practised,[Pg 86]
seems in the preceding pages to be fairly established.
I claim, therefore, that I have discovered and
described the main secret of the pyramids, that I have
found for them at last a practical use, and that it is no
longer "a marvel how after the annual inundation, each
property could have been accurately described by the aid
of geometry." I have advanced nothing in the shape of
a theory that will not stand a practical test; but to do
it, the pyramids should be re-cased. Iron sheeting, on
iron or wooden framework, would answer. I may be
wrong in some of my conclusions, but in the main I am
satisfied that I am right. It must be admitted that I
have worked under difficulties; a glimpse at the pyramids
three and twenty years ago, and the meagre library
of a nomad in the Australian wilderness having been all
my advantages, and time at my disposal only that
snatched from the rare intervals of leisure afforded by
an arduous professional life.

After fruitless waiting for a chance of visiting Egypt
and Europe, to sift the matter to the bottom, I have at
last resolved to give my ideas to the world as they stand;
crude necessarily, so I must be excused if in some details
I may be found erroneous; there is truth I know
in the general conclusions. I am presumptuous enough
to believe that the R.B. cubit of 1·685 British feet was
the measure of the pyramids of Gïzeh, although there
may have been an astronomical 25 inch cubit also. It
appears to me that no cubit measure to be depended on
is either to be got from a stray measuring stick found[Pg 87]
in the joints of a ruined building, or from any line or
dimensions of one of the pyramids. I submit that a
most reasonable way to get a cubit measure out of the
Pyramids of Gïzeh, was to do as I did:       take them as a
whole, comprehend and establish the general ground
plan, find it geometric and harmonic, obtain the ratios
of all the lines, establish a complete set of natural and
even numbers to represent the measures of the lines,
and finally bring these numbers to cubits by a common
multiplier (which in this case was the number eight).
After the whole proportions had been thus expressed
in a cubit evolved from the whole proportions, I established
its length in British feet by dividing the base of
Cephren, as known, by the number of my cubits representing
its base. It is pretty sound evidence of the
theory being correct that this test, with 420 cubits neat
for Cephren, gave me also a neat measure for Cheops,
from Piazzi Smyth's base, of 452 cubits, and that at the
same level, these two pyramids become equal based.

I have paid little attention to the inside measurements.
I take it we should first obtain our exoteric
knowledge before venturing on esotoric research. Thus
the intricate internal measurements of Cheops, made by
various enquirers have been little service to me, while
the accurate measures of the base of Cheops by Piazzi
Smyth, and John James Wild's letter to Lord Brougham,
helped me amazingly, as from the two I established
the plan level and even bases of Cheops and
Cephren at plan level       as I have shown in the preceding[Pg 88]
pages. My theory demanded that both for the
building of the pyramids and for the construction of the
models or subsidiary instruments of the surveyors, simple
slope ratios should govern each building; before I
conclude, I shall show how I got at my slope ratios, by
evolving them from the general ground plan.

I am firmly convinced that a careful investigation
into the ground plans of the various other groups of
pyramids will amply confirm my survey theory       the relative
positions of the groups should also be established       much
additional light will be then thrown on the subject.

Let me conjure the investigator to view these piles
from a distance with his mind's eye, as the old surveyors
viewed them with their bodily eye. Approach them
too nearly, and, like Henry Kinglake, you will be lost
in the "one idea of solid immensity." Common sense
tells us they were built to be viewed from a distance.

Modern surveyors stand near their instruments, and
send their flagmen to a distance; the Egyptian surveyor
was one of his own flagmen, and his instruments
were towering to the skies on the distant horizon.
These mighty tools will last out many a generation of
surveyors.

The modern astronomer from the top of an observatory
points his instruments direct at the stars; the
Egyptian astronomer from the summit of his particular
pyramid directed his observations to the rising and setting
of the stars, or the positions of the heavenly bodies[Pg 89]
in respect to the far away groups of pyramids scattered
around him in the distance; and by comparing notes,
and with the knowledge of the relative position of the
groups, did these observers map out the sky. Solar and
lunar shadows of their own pyramids on the flat
trenches prepared for the purpose, enabled the astronomer
at each observatory to record the annual and
monthly flight of time, while its hours were marked by
the shadows of their obelisks, capped by copper
pyramids or balls, on the more delicate pavements
of the court-yards of their public buildings.

We must grasp that their celestial and terrestrial
surveys were almost a reverse process to our own,
before we can venture to enquire into its details. It
then becomes a much easier tangle to unravel. That a
particular pyramid among so many, should have been
chosen as a favoured interpreter of Divine truths, seems
an unfair conclusion to the other pyramids;       that the
other pyramids were rough and imperfect imitations,
appears to my poor capacity "a base and impotent
conclusion;"       (as far as I can learn, Mycerinus, in its
perfection, was a marvel of the mason's art;) but that
one particular pyramid should have anything to do with
the past or the future of the lost ten tribes of Israel
(whoever that fraction of our present earthly community
may be), seems to me the wildest conclusion of all,
except perhaps the theory that this one pyramid points
to the future of the British race. Yet in one way
do I admit that the pyramids point to our future.[Pg 90]

Thirty-six centuries ago, they, already venerable
with antiquity, looked proudly down on living labouring
Israel, in helpless slavery, in the midst of an advanced
civilization, of which the history, language, and religion
are now forgotten, or only at best, slightly understood.

Thirty-six centuries hence, they may look down on a
civilization equally strange, in which our history, language,
and religion, Hebrew race, and British race, may
have no place, no part.

If the thoughts of noble poets live, as they seem to
do, old Cheops, that mountain of massive masonry,
may (like the brook of our Laureate), in that dim
future, still be singing, as he seems to sing now, this
idea, though not perhaps these words:


"For men may come, and men may go,
But I go on for ever."


"Ars longa, vita brevis." Man's work remains, when
the workman is forgotten; fair work and square, can
never perish entirely from men's minds, so long as the
world stands. These pyramids were grand and noble
works, and they will not perish till their reputation has
been re-established in the world, when they will live
in men's memories to all generations as symbols of the
mighty past. To the minds of many now, as to Josephus
in his day, they are "vast and vain monuments,"
records of folly. To me they are as monuments of
peace, civilization and order       relics of a people living
under wise and beneficent rulers       evidences of cultivation,
science, and art.[Pg 91]


§ 16. THE PENTANGLE OR FIVE POINTED STAR THE GEOMETRIC SYMBOL OF THE GREAT PYRAMID.

From time immemorial this symbol has been a
blazing pointer to grand and noble truths, and a solemn
emblem of important duties.

Its geometric significance, however, has long been
lost sight of.

It is said to have constituted the seal or signet
of King Solomon (1000 B.C.), and in early times it was
in use among the Jews, as a symbol of safety.

It was the Pentalpha of Pythagoras, and the Pythagorean
emblem of health (530 B.C.).

It was carried as the banner of Antiochus, King of
Syria (surnamed Soter, or the Preserver), in his wars
against the Gauls (260 B.C.). Among the Cabalists, the
star with the sacred name written on each of its points,
and in the centre, was considered talismanic; and
in ancient times it was employed all over Asia as a
charm against witchcraft. Even now, European troops
at war with Arab tribes, sometimes find, under the
clothing, on the breasts of their slain enemies, this
ancient emblem, in the form of a metal talisman, or
charm.

The European Göethe puts these words into the
mouth of Mephistopheles:

"I am hindered egress by a quaint device upon the threshold,       that
five-toed damned spell."[Pg 92]

I shall set forth the geometric significance of this star,
as far as my general subject warrants me, and show that
it is the geometric emblem of extreme and mean ratio, and
the symbol of the Egyptian Pyramid Cheops.

A plane geometric star, or a solid geometric pyramid,
may be likened to the corolla of a flower, each
separate side representing a petal. With its petals
opened and exposed to view, the flower appears in all
its glorious beauty; but when closed, many of its
beauties are hidden. The botanist seeks to view it flat
or open in its geometric symmetry, and also closed, as a
bud, or in repose:       yet judges and appreciates the one
state from the other. In the same manner must we deal
with the five pointed star, and also with the Pyramid
Cheops.

In dealing with so quaint a subject, I may be
excused, in passing, for the quaint conceit of likening
the interior galleries and chambers of this pyramid
to the interior whorl of a flower, stamens and pistil,
mysterious and incomprehensible.

Figure 67 (page 101), is the five pointed star,
formed by the unlapping of the five slant sides of a
pyramid with a pentagonal base.

Figure 70 (page 106), is a star formed by the unlapping
of the four slant sides of the pyramid Cheops.

The pentagon GFRHQ, (Fig. 67) is the base of the
pyramid "Pentalpha" and the triangles EGF, BFR,
ROH, HNQ and QAG, represent the five sides, so that
supposing the lines GF, FR, RH, HQ and QG, to be[Pg 93]
hinges connecting these sides with the base, then by
lifting the sides, and closing them in, the points A, E,
B, O, and N, would meet over the centre C.

Thus do we close the geometric flower Pentalpha,
and convert it into a pyramid.

In the same manner must we lift the four slant sides
of the pyramid Cheops from its star development,
(Fig. 70) and close them in, the four points meeting
over the centre of the base, forming the solid pyramid.
Such transitions point to the indissoluble connection
between plane and solid geometry.

As the geometric emblem of extreme and mean ratio,
the pentangle appears as an assemblage of lines divided
the one by the others in extreme and mean ratio.

To explain to readers not versed in geometry, what
extreme and mean ratio signifies, I refer to Figure 65:       



Fig. 65.



Let AB be the given line to be divided in extreme and mean ratio,
i.e., so that the whole line may be to the greater part, as the
greater is to the less part.

Draw BC perpendicular to AB, and equal to half AB.
Join AC; and with BC as a radius from C as a centre,
describe the arc DB; then with centre A, and radius[Pg 94]
AD, describe the arc DE; so shall AB be divided in E,
in extreme and mean ratio, or so that AB: AE:: AE:
EB. (Note that AE is equal to the side of a decagon
inscribed in a circle with radius AB.)

Let it be noted that since the division of a line in
mean and extreme ratio is effected by means of the 2, 1
triangle, ABC, therefore, as the exponent of this ratio,
another reason presents itself why it should be so important
a feature in the Gïzeh pyramids in addition to
its connection with the primary triangle 3, 4, 5.



Fig. 66.



To complete the explanation offered with figure 65,
I must refer to Fig. 66, where in constructing a pentagon,
the 2, 1 triangle ABC, is again made use of.

The line AB is a side of the pentagon. The line
BC is a perpendicular to it, and half its length.
The line AC is produced to F, CF being made
equal to CB; then with B as a centre, and radius
BF, the arc at E is described; and with A as a
centre, and the same radius, the arc at E is intersected,
their intersection being the centre of the[Pg 95]
circle circumscribing the pentagon, and upon
which the remaining sides are laid off.

We will now refer to figure 67, in which the pentangle
appears as the symbolic exponent of the division
of lines in extreme and mean ratio.




 Thus: MC        :        MH        ::        MH        :        HC
 AF        :        AG        ::        AG        :        GF
 AB        :        AF        ::        AF        :        FB


while MN, MH or XC : CD :: 2 : 1       being the geometric
template of the work.

Thus every line in this beautiful symbol by its intersections
with the other lines, manifests the problem.

Note also that


    GH = GA
    AE = AF
    DH = DE


I append a table showing the comparative measures
of the lines in Fig. 67, taking radius of the circle as a

The triangle DXH represents a vertical section of
the pentagonal pyramid; the edge HX is equal to HN,
and the apothem DX is equal to DE. Let DH be a[Pg 97]
hinge attaching the plane DXH to the base, now lift
the plane DXH until the point X is vertical above the
centre C. Then the points A, E, B, O, N of the five
slant slides, when closed up, will all meet at the point X
over the centre C.

We have now built a pyramid out of the pentangle,
whose slope is 2 to 1, altitude CX being to CD as 2
to 1.




 ApothemDX = DE
 AltitudeCX = HM or MN
 AltitudeCX + CH = CM radius.
 ApothemDX + CD = CM radius.
 EdgeHX = HN or PF


Note also that




 (MP)= CH

 OP= HR

Let us now consider the Pentangle as the symbol of
the Great Pyramid Cheops.

    The line MP = the base of Cheops.
   The line CH = half base of Cheops.
   The line HM = apothem of Cheops.
    The line HN = slant edge of Cheops.

    Thus: Apothem of Cheops = side of decagon.

    Apothem of Cheops = altitude of pentagonal pyramid.[Pg 98]
    Slant edge of Cheops = slant edge of pentagonal pyramid.

  Now since apothem of Cheops = MH
      and half base of Cheops = HC


then do apothem and half base represent, when taken
together, extreme and mean ratio, and altitude is a
mean proportional between them: it having already
been stated, which also is proved by the figures in the
table, that MC : MH :: MH : HC and apoth: alt ::
alt : half base.

Thus is the four pointed star Cheops evolved from
the five pointed star Pentalpha. This is shown clearly
by Fig. 68, thus:       



Fig. 68.


Within a circle describe a pentangle, around the
interior pentagon of the star describe a circle, around
the circle describe a square; then will the square represent
the base of Cheops.

Draw two diameters of the outer circle passing
through the centre square at right angles to each other,
and each diameter parallel to sides of the square; then[Pg 99]
will the parts of these diameters between the square
and the outer circle represent the four apothems of the
four slant sides of the pyramid. Connect the angles of
the square with the circumference of the outer circle by
lines at the four points indicated by the diameters, and
the star of the pyramid is formed, which, when closed
as a solid, will be a correct model of Cheops.




 Calling apothem of Cheops,MH = 34
 and half base,HC = 21
 as per Figure 6. Then        MH +MC = 55

and 55 : 34 :: 34 : 21·018, being only in error a few
inches in the pyramid itself, if carried into actual measures.

The ratio, therefore, of apothem to half-base, 34 to
21, which I ascribe to Cheops, is as near as stone and
mortar can be got to illustrate the above proportions.

Correctly stated arithmetically let MH = 2.




 ThenHC = √5 - 1
MC = √5 + 1
and altitude of Cheops = √(MH × MC)
[Pg 100]
Let us now compare the construction of the two
stars:

The question now arises, does this pyramid Cheops
set forth by the relations of its altitude to perimeter of[Pg 101]
base the ratio of diameter to circumference; or, does it
set forth mean proportional, and extreme and mean
ratio, by the proportions of its apothem, altitude, and
half-base? The answer is       from the practical impossibility
of such extreme accuracy in such a mass of
masonry, that it points alike to all, and may as fairly be
considered the exponent of the one as of the others.
Piazzi Smyth makes Cheops 761·65 feet base, and
484·91 feet altitude, which is very nearly what he calls
a Π pyramid, for which I reckon the altitude would be
about 484·87 feet with the same base: and for a pyramid
of extreme and mean ratio the altitude would be
484·34 feet.

The whole difference, therefore, is only about six
inches in a height of nearly five hundred feet. This
difference, evidently beyond the power of man to discover,
now that the pyramid is a ruin, would even in its
perfect state have been inappreciable.

It appears most probable that the star Pentalpha
led to the star Cheops, and that the star Cheops
(Fig. 70) was the plan used by the ancient architect,
and the ratio of 34 to 21, hypotenuse to base, the template
used by the ancient builders.

Suppose some king said to his architect, "Make me
a plan of a pyramid, of which the base shall be 420
cubits square, and altitude shall be to the perimeter of
the base as the radius of a circle to the circumference."       Then
might the architect prepare an elaborate plan
in which the relative dimensions would be about[Pg 102]

420267·380304      c.339·988573      c.


The king then orders another pyramid, of the same
base, of which altitude is to be a mean proportional between
apothem and half-base       and apothem and half-base
taken as one line are to be in mean and extreme
ratio.

The architect's plan of this pyramid will be the
simple figure illustrated by me (Fig. 70), and the
dimensions about

But the builder practically carries out both plans when
he builds to my templates of 34 to 21 with

and neither king nor architect could detect error in the
work.

The reader will remember that I have previously
advanced that the level of Cephren's base was the plan
level of the Gïzeh pyramids, and that at this level the[Pg 103]
base of Cheops measures 420 R.B. cubits       same as the
base of Cephren.

This hypothesis is supported by the revelations of
the pentangle, in which the ratio of 34 to 21 = apothem
340 to half-base 210 R.B. cubits, is so nearly approached.

Showing how proportional lines were the order of
the pyramids of Gïzeh, we will summarise the proportions
of the three main pyramids as shewn by my dimensions
and ratios, very nearly, viz.:       


Mycerinus. Base : Apothem :: Altitude : Half-Base.
as shown by the ratios, (Fig. 13), 40 : 32 :: 25 : 20.

Cephren. Diagonal of Base : Edge :: Edge : Altitude.
as shown by ratios, (Fig. 12), 862 : 588 :: 588 : 400.

Cheops. (Apothem + Half Base): Apoth. :: Apoth. : Half Base.
as shown by the ratios, (Fig. 9), 55 : 34 :: 34 : 21.

and       Apothem : Altitude :: Altitude : Half-B.


Similar close relations to other stars may be found in
other pyramids. Thus:       Suppose NHO of figure 69 to
be the NHO of a heptangle instead of a pentangle, then
does NH represent apothem, and NO represent base of
the pyramid Mycerinus, while the co-sine of the angle
NHM (being MH minus versed sine) will be equal to
the altitude of the pyramid. The angle NHM in the
heptangle is, 38° 34′ 17·142″, and according to my plan
of the pyramid Mycerinus, the corresponding angle is
38° 40′ 56″. (See Fig. 19.) This angular difference of
0° 6′ 39″ would only make a difference in the apothem[Pg 104]
of the pyramid of eight inches, and of ten inches in its
altitude (apothem being 283 ft. 1 inch, and altitude
221 ft.).


§ 17. THE MANNER IN WHICH THE SLOPE RATIOS OF THE PYRAMIDS WERE ARRIVED
AT.

The manner in which I arrived at the Slope Ratios
of the Pyramids, viz., 32 to 20, 33 to 20, and 34 to 21,
for Mycerinus, Cephren, and Cheops, respectively (see
Figures 8, 7 and 6), was as follows:       

First, believing in the connection between the relative
positions of the Pyramids on plan (see Fig. 3, 4 or
5), and their slopes, I viewed their positions thus:       

Mycerinus, situate at the angle of the 3, 4, 5 triangle
ADC, is likely to be connected with that "primary"
in his slopes.

Cephren, situate at the angle of the 20, 21, 29 triangle
FAB, and strung, as it were, on the hypotenuse
of the 3, 4, 5 triangle DAC, is likely to be connected
with both primaries in his slopes.

Cheops, situate at the point A, common to both
main triangles, governing the position of the other
pyramids, is likely to be a sort of mean between these
two pyramids in his slope ratios.

Reasoning thus, with the addition of the knowledge
I possessed of the angular estimates of these slopes
made by those who had visited the ground, and a useful
start for my ratios gained by the reduction of base
measures already known into R.B. cubits, giving 420 as[Pg 105]
a general base for Cheops and Cephren at one level,
and taking 210 cubits as the base of Mycerinus (half
the base of Cephren, as generally admitted), I had
something solid and substantial to go upon. I commenced
with Mycerinus. (See Fig. 71.)



(Mycerīnus) Fig. 71.



LHNM represents the base of the pyramid. On
the half-base AC I described a 3, 4, 5 triangle ABC. I
then projected the line CF = BC to be the altitude of
the pyramid. Thus I erected the triangle BFC, ratio of
BC to CF being 1 to 1. From this datum I arrived at
the triangles BEA, ADC, and GKH. GK, EA, and
AD, each represent apothem of pyramid; CF, and CD,
altitude; and HK, edge.

The length of the line AD being √(AC² + CD²), the
length of the line HK being √(HG² + GK²), and line CH
(half diagonal of base) being √(CG² + GH²). These
measures reduced to R.B. cubits, calling the line AC =
ratio 4 = 105 cubits, half-base of pyramid, give the following
results:[Pg 106]       





 R. B.CUBITS. BRITISH FEET.
 Half-base LA =105·000 =176·925
 Apothem EA =168·082 =283·218
 Edge HK =198·183 =333·937
 Altitude CD =131·250 =221·156
 Half diag. of base CH =148·4924 =250·209

and thus I acquired the ratios:       




 Half-base       :       Altitude       ::       Apothem       :       Base.
 = 20       :       25       ::       32       :       40 nearly.

To place the lines of the diagram in their actual
solid position       Let AB, BC, CA and HG be hinges
attaching the planes AEB, BFC, CDA and HKG to
the base LHNM. Lift the plane BCF on its hinge till
the point F is vertical over the centre C. Lift plane
CDA on its hinge, till point D is vertical over the
centre C; then will line CD touch CF, and become
one line. Now lift the plane AEB on its hinge, until
point E is vertical over the centre C, and plane HKG
on its hinge till point K is vertical over the centre C;
then will points E, F, D and K, all meet at one point
above the centre C, and all the lines will be in their
proper places.

The angle at the base of Mycerinus, if built to a
ratio of 4 to 5 (half-base to altitude), and not to the
more practical but nearly perfect ratio of 32 to 20 (apothem
to half-base) would be the complement of angle
ADC, thus       



4= ·8 = Tan.      ADC= 38° 39′ 35165″
5  477
∴       DAC= 51° 20′ 24312″
 477


[Pg 107]

but as it is probable that the pyramid was built to the
ratio of 32 to 20, I have shown its base angle in Figure
19, as 51° 19′ 4″.

Figure 72 shows how the slopes of Cephren were
arrived at.



(Cephren) Fig. 72.



LHNM represents the base of the pyramid. On
the half-base AC, I described a 3, 4, 5 triangle ABC.
I then projected the line CF (ratio 21 to BC 20), thus
erecting the 20, 21, 29 triangle BCF. From this datum,
I arrived at the triangles BEA, ADC, and GKH;
GK, EA and AD each representing apothem; CF and
CD, altitude; and HK, edge. The lengths of the lines
AD, HK and CH being got at as in the pyramid Mycerinus.
These measures reduced to cubits, calling
AC = ratio 16 = 210 cubits (half-base of pyramid) give
the following result.



R. B. CUBITS.BRITISH FEET.
 Half-base 210·00353·85 = LA
 Apothem 346·50583·85 = EA
 Edge 405·16682·69 = HK
 Altitude 275·625464·43 = CD
 Half-diag. of base 296·985500·42 = CH

[Pg 108]

thus I get the ratios of       Apothem : Half-Base :: 33 : 20,      c.
The planes in the diagram are placed in their
correct positions, as directed for Figure 71.

The angle at the base of Cephren, if built to the
ratio of 16 to 21 (half-base to altitude), and not to the
practical ratio of 33 to 20 (apothem to half-base), would
be the complement of      ADC, thus       



16= ·761904 = Tan.      ADC= 37° 18′ 1416″
21 46
∴      DAC= 52° 41′ 4530″
 46


but as it is probable that the pyramid was built to the
ratio of 33 to 20, I have marked the base angle in Fig.
17, as 52° 41′ 41″.

I took Cheops out, first as a Π pyramid, and made
his lines to a base of 420 cubits, as follows       




 Half-base210
 Altitude267·380304
 Apothem339·988573 (See Fig. 73.)



(Cheops) Fig. 73.


But to produce the building ratio of 34 to 21, as per
diagram Figure 6 or 9, I had to alter it to       [Pg 109]




 Half-base210
 Altitude267·394839
 Apothem340

Thus the theoretical angle of Cheops is 51° 51′ 14·3″,
and the probable angle at which it was built, is 51° 51′
20″, as per figure 15.

Cheops is therefore the mean or centre of a system       the
slopes of Mycerinus being a little flatter, and those
of Cephren a little steeper, Cheops coming fairly between
the two, within about 10 minutes; and thus the
connection between the ground plan of the group and
the slopes of the three pyramids is exactly as one might
expect after examination of Figure 3, 4 or 5.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
