PREFACE
</H3>

<P>
Nearly all these Poems have appeared during the past year in the
columns of the <I>Globe</I> and the <I>Mail</I> and <I>Empire</I> of Toronto, and the
<I>Free Press</I> of Detroit, Michigan.
</P>

<P>
When the Author read from his poems last winter before the Women's
Press Club of Toronto one of its members suggested that an engrossed
and illuminated copy of the poem, "I Take Off My Hat to Albert," be
presented to His Majesty, King Albert of Belgium.  This was done
through the kind offices and courtesy of Mr. Goor, the Belgian
Consul-General at Ottawa.
</P>

<P>
His Majesty's gracious letter of acceptance, which the reader will find
on another page, is indeed a Royal Foreword to these poetic blossoms of
a piteous though heroic time.

I TAKE OFF MY HAT TO ALBERT<BR>
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
<I>Albert, King of Belgium, is the hero of the hour;<BR>
He's the greatest king in Europe, he's a royal arch and tower;<BR>
He is bigger in the trenches than the Kaiser on his Throne,<BR>
And the whole world loves him for the sorrows he has known:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I take off my hat to Albert.</I><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
<I>Defiance was his answer to the Teuton at his gate,<BR>
Then he buckled on his armor and pledged his soul to fate;<BR>
He stood between his people and the biggest Essen gun,<BR>
For he feared not shot nor shrapnel as his little army won:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I take off my hat to Albert.</I><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
<I>King of Belgium, Duke of Brabant, Count of Flanders, all in one;<BR>
Little Kingdom of the Belgae starr'd with honor in the sun!<BR>
You have won a place in history, of your deeds the world will sing,<BR>
But the glory of your nation is your dust-stained, fearless King:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I take off my hat to Albert.</I><BR>

THE KAISER'S FAVORITE POEMS<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
What are the Kaiser's favorite poems?<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, now, you tax me hard:<BR>
I know the Kaiser's favorite drink<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But do not know his bard;<BR>
I'm sure it is not Schiller<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who reigns in German homes.<BR>
Nor yet Olympian Goethe,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who writes the Kaiser's poems.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Perhaps that Heinrich Heine<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has touched the Kaiser's soul;<BR>
Or Arndt with his trumpet call<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a new conscription roll;<BR>
Or, Walther von der Vogelweide<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his nest in mythic domes,<BR>
Is the author and creator<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the Kaiser's favorite poems.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
If I saw the Kaiser's library<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'd know well what he reads&mdash;<BR>
The color of his fancy<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the prompter of his deeds:<BR>
I'd learn the depth and wisdom<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of his theories and his gnomes,<BR>
If I got but just a glance or two<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the Kaiser's favorite poems.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Then let us go to Essen,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the Kaiser's books are bound;<BR>
They are full of "steel" engravings&mdash;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All "best sellers" there are found;<BR>
For the Prussian soul and spirit<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaks in rhythm thro' those tomes,<BR>
And these without a question,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are the Kaiser's favorite poems.<BR>

The Pilates of Teutonic blood<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
O, the Kaiser's bhoys are marching, "nach Paris" they are going,<BR>
But they've sthopped to rest a minit at the Marne and at the Meuse;<BR>
And the Gordons and the Ministers are thryin' to entertain them,<BR>
For they've every kind of "record" that the Teutons want to choose;<BR>
They have battle cries that sounded for centuries in the Highlands,<BR>
They have war cries fierce and stirring as the breath of Munster gales;<BR>
They are shoutin' to the heavens, and they're shoutin' to the Kaiser,<BR>
"<I>Faugh-a-ballagh!</I>" sons of Odin, or we'll tie you up like bales.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
O, the Kaiser's bhoys are dramin' of a naval base at Calais,<BR>
But they wakin' ivery mornin' full of sorrow and of gloom;<BR>
For the little Belgian sojers cut the dykes and flood their trenches,<BR>
And they find their dugouts only jist a bathtub or a tomb.<BR>
But they're makin' progress backward, "<I>nach Berlin</I>" they are going,<BR>
With their "<I>Landsturms</I>" and their "<I>Land-wehrs</I>,"<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;keepin' sthep in dim grey line;<BR>
And they'll know far more of Britain and her brood of lions snarlin',<BR>

Through the vigils deep of the sable night<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mother sits in grief alone,<BR>
For her sons have gone to the battle front<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And left on the hearth a crushing stone.<BR>
Beyond the stars that burn at night<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sees God's arm in pity reach;<BR>
It counsels patience, love and faith,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heroic hearts and souls to teach.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
The blue is spann'd and the tide goes out.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the stars rain down a kindlier cheer;<BR>
And the mother turns from this throne of grief<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To pierce the years with a joyous tear;<BR>
For duty born of a mother's heart<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fills all the rounds of our common day&mdash;<BR>
Yea, sheds its joy in the darkest night,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fills with light each hidden way.<BR>

All day the guns belched fire and death<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And filled the hours with gloom;<BR>
The fateful music smote the sky<BR>

But as the evening stars came forth<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A truce to death and strife,<BR>
There rose from hearts of patriot love<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tender song of life.<BR>

A song of home and fireside<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swelled on the evening air,<BR>
And men forgot their battle line,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its carnage and dark care;<BR>
The soldier dropp'd his rifle<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And joined the choral song,<BR>
As high above the tide of war<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It swept and pulsed along.<BR>

That night while sleeping where the stars<BR>

When the German troops were marching with the Uhlans far ahead,<BR>
The objective point being Paris, as the Berlin wireless said,<BR>
There was trouble in the Louvre, 'mong the paintings on the walls,<BR>
There were shoutings 'cross the centuries, there were<BR>

"Mona Lisa" ceased her smiling and "The Banker and His Wife"<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for their life;<BR>
While "The Gypsy Girl" of Franz Hals, fearful of impending fate,<BR>
Roused "The Shepherds in Arcadia" with "The Hun is at the Gate!"<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Then the panic spread on all sides till the battle of the Marne<BR>
Solved all danger of the looting, removed all need to warn;<BR>
Straight "The Lace Maker" from Flemish Bruges in the joyous choral led<BR>
Smiled at "Charles First of England" who had lost his crown and head;<BR>
For fear had left the Louvre when the Teutons turned in flight,<BR>
So they scanned the sky no longer for dread Zeppelins in the night.<BR>
And the paintings born of centuries touched by genius into life<BR>
Still are hanging in the Louvre 'mid war's clash and clang and strife.<BR>

God searched for a Ruler to sceptre the land,<BR>

He found a young Shepherd boy watching his flock<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the mountains looked down on deep meadows of green;<BR>
He hailed the young Shepherd boy king of the land<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And anointed his brow with a Chrism unseen.<BR>

And heaped on his realm all the woes that war brings,<BR>
And bartering his purple for the greed of his heart<BR>
He lost both the sceptre and Chrism of Kings.<BR>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
